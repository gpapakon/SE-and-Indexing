<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a fully shielded 
printed circuit (PC) card holder, that may be readily 

"snapped" into the assembly, or disassembled, as the 
case may be. The holder is intended to receive a PC 

card, where at least one end of the card is adapted to 
be electrically connected to an I/O type connector. The 

holder comprises a generally rectangular bottom cover 
member formed of a conductive material, corner supports 

integrally molded to said bottom cover member at the 
respective corners thereof, where each said support 

includes a lower flange portion to which said bottom 
cover member is exposed. Further, a generally 

rectangular upper cover member is provided where the 
periphery thereof includes a downwardly extending flange 

adapted to engage the lower flange portion in electrical 
contact with the bottom cover member over a substantial 

portion of the periphery thereof. In the assembled 
condition, the holder provides continuous shielding 

against distortion of data signals between the PC card 
and the I/O type connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to memory cards and more
particularly to a shielding apparatus for memory cards.With the advent of sophisticated computers,
facsimile machines, printers, and other computer-related
electronics equipment, the need for external printed
circuit (PC) interface to be used by the computer and
computer-related equipment is ever increasing. To this
end, memory cards containing external memory and data to
be used in computer processes have been designed. At
the present time, there are three different memory card
types, as defined by the Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA). This is the
standards body responsible for developing the 68-pin
memory card standard. The three memory card types, are
as follows:
a. Type I Memory Cards are the same width and
length as a common credit card, 54mm x 85.6mm, but are
thicker than a credit card. The thickness of a Type I
card is 3.3mm (.130").b. Type II Memory Cards are used by those
companies which are utilizing memory components that are
too high to be housed within a Type I card. Type II
memory cards are also the same overall length and width
as credit cards, but have raised body cross section in
the substrate area which gives them an overall thickness
of 5mm (.195"). The raised substrate areas of these
cards are 48mm in width.c. Type III Memory Cards are the result of a
recent movement sponsored by the Small Form Factor
Committee (SFF) to enable 1.8" Small Form Factor Disk
Drives to be plugged into memory card connectors in
small portable computer applications. Type III Memory
Cards are the same length and width as Type I and Type
II Cards. However, Type III Cards have a substrate area
thickness of 10.5mm. Also, Type III Cards require a 
card guide opening width of 51mm of the header connector
to accommodate the slightly raised substrate area.Memory cards generally comprise a printed circuit
board, a casing made of an insulating material for
housing the printed circuit board, and at least one
connector, typically referred to as an "I/O" connector.
The connector is provided on one end of the casing for
interfacing the memory card, and particularly the
printed circuit board contained in the casing, to the
computer equipment to which the card is mated. The
connector is designed to extract the contents of the
memory stored on the printed circuit board and to bus
data to and from an outside environment, which also
usually comprises a computer or other electronic
equipment. In this fashion, data traverses the
interface between

characterized in that
a) said frame (14) has side rails (30) integrally molded to said
shield members (12) and
b) wherein tapered surfaces (60) are provided along said flanges
(52) of shield member (16) for snap engagement therewith.
A shielded card holder as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that

said rails (30) have recess (42) for receiving a disassembly tool to
disengage the shield members.

characterized
in that
 one of said shield members (12, 16) includes a 
grounding tab (46) for electrically engaging a ground trace on the

memory card.
A shielded card holder as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized
in that
 said frame (14) comprises surface portions (32) for
supporting the memory card thereon.
A shielded card holder as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5,
