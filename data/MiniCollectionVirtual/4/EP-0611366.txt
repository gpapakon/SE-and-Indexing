<ABSTRACT>
Compounds having acidic protons and a molecular structure which can delocalize the electron density of the conjugate base (target compounds) are chlorinated by contacting such compounds with a perchloroalkane and aqueous base in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst which is a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide. Chlorinated products, preferably gem-dichloro compounds, are produced. The gem-dichloro compounds are useful for alkylation of aromatic compounds. For instance fluorene is chlorinated to form 9,9-dichlorofluorene which is reacted with such compounds as phenol or aniline to form such compounds as 9,9-bis(hydroxyphenyl)fluorene, 9,9-bis(aminophenyl)fluorene, or 9-aminophenyl-9-chlorofluorene.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CHLORINATION PROCESS, ALKYLATION OF PRODUCTS OF SAID PROCESS AND SOME PRODUCTS THEREOFThis invention relates to chlorination, particularly to chlorination of organic5 compounds having acidic protons. The invention also relates to subsequent reaction of certain chlorinated products, more particularly the use of these products to alkylate aromatic compounds.Products of compounds such as fluorene in which the acidic protons have been replaced by chlorine undergo alkylation reactions which are useful in preparing other10 compounds such as bis(hydroxyphenyl)-fluorenes and bis(amιnophenyl)fluorenes and other functionally substituted aromatic compounds which in turn find applications as monomers for high performance polymers It is particularly important that the chlorination be specific to produce the desired isomers, preferably in the substantial absence of other chlorination products. For instance, in the case of chlorination of fluorene to produce 9,9 dichlorofluorene15 it is very important that chlorination of the aromatic rings bo avoidedIda Smed ley reported a preparation of 9,9-dichlorofluorene in 1905 from heating fluorenone and a slight excess of phosphorus pentachlorιde (J. Chem. Soc. 87, 1249 (1905). Smedley did not report a yield, but did mention that the product contained fluorenone and required recrystallization from benzene Ray et al. repeated Smedley's method and attained a20 66 weight percent yield. (J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 70, 1954 (1948).) Ray et al report that the pure product is quite stable if protected from moisture, but that samples of impure material decomposed within a week to give a sticky green-yellow mass with the sharp odor of hydrogen chloride.Chlorinations of compounds having acidic protons and a molecular structure25 which can delocalize the electron density of the conjugate base such as fluorene using common chlorination agents such as chlorine, sulfuryl chloride, N-chlorosuccinimide and phosphorus pentachloride are generally disadvantageous because the products of such reactions exhibit substitution on the aromatic rings, instead of substitution of the acidic protons Therefore, it is 

 notfeasibleto prepare 9,9-dichlorofluorene from fluorene using conventional chlorination technology.A procedure for the preparation of 9,9-dichlorofluorene directly from fluorene, without fluorenone as an intermediate, was reported by Reeves et al. in Israel J. Chem 26, 225, (1985). Tetrabutylammonium bromide was used as a phase transfer catalyst to chlorinate such compounds as fluorene,
