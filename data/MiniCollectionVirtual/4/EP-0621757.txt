<ABSTRACT>
A frame (2) for an image such as a picture (12) is formed from a microlens array. Such an array produces an apparent optical plane which is not coplanar with the real plane of the array. This produces the visual effect of the picture (16) being divorced from the frame (2) and an illusion of depth is created as between the frame (2) and the picture (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image frames and has particular, although not
exclusive, relevance to frames surrounding pictures for display in order to increase the
depth effect in those pictures.Frames for images have long been known. Examples in the art are most frequently
encountered when employed for decorative purposes such as wooden frames forming loops
around paintings or photographs or the like. Although the purpose of such frames is
primarily a decorative effect, they also serve to provide the viewer with an enhanced
contrast between the picture and the surrounding scenery, such as a wall. Such contrast
provides the visual effect of the picture seeming to stand alone and be somewhat divorced
from the surrounding scenery.US Patent US-A-5052783 (Sharp) described an arrangement which is for use with a
liquid crystal display panel. The arrangement aims to provide a brighter display.US Patent US-A-3582961 (Shindo) is an arrangement which surrounds an image
such as a television or cinema screen, but lies in a different plane from the image. The
arrangement comprises a frame of varying opacity. The features of the preamble of the
independent apparatus claim of the present Application are disclosed in US-A-3 582 961.An example of an image frame which attempts to suppress the real plane of the
image surrounded thereby by suppressing the stereoscopic cues in the area surrounding the
picture is given in US Patent Number 4,651,219. In this document there is disclosed an
image frame having a concave cross-sectional configuration, the optical surfaces of which
are blackened thereby to minimise light reflection therefrom. In this way the image which
is bordered by the frame appears to hang in space because the frame itself is substantially
invisible to an observer.Even when allowance is made for the enhanced contrast gained by the employment
of such frames, it is still apparent to the viewer that both the picture and the frame are
substantially coplanar, and that the picture is flat or two dimensional. Furthermore, in the
case of a painting mounted within a frame and placed on a wall, then the picture, frame and
the wall are all generally coplanar.Being substantially coplanar precludes any significant parallax effect to be observed
by the viewer.It is thus an object of the present invention to at least alleviate the lack of parallax
effects observed when viewing a framed image. If parallax effects can be observed, then 
the viewed image may be perceived by the viewer to possess at least a degree of

<CLAIMS>
An image frame comprising at least one microlens array member (2) arranged to
form a closed structure for surrounding an image (16) to be framed, the microlens array

member (2) being arranged to create a parallax effect between the image (16) and the frame
by surrounding the image (16) without leaving significant gaps between the image and the

mircolens array member (2), 
characterised in that
 said at least one microlens array member
comprises two microlens arrays of differing pitch, one overlying the other in order to create

a form of Moire interference.
An image frame according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the image (16) to be
framed and the at least one microlens array member (2) are substantially coplanar.
An image frame according to either claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 a plurality of
microlens array members (2) are arranged in juxtaposition such that the apparent planes of

respective adjacent members (2a and 2b) lie on opposite sides of the real planes thereof.
A method of framing an image comprising: providing a two-dimensional image
(16) and forming at least one closed microlens array member (2) around the image so that

the said at least one microlens array member (2) creates a parallax effect between the image
and the frame without leaving significant gaps between the image (16) and said microlens

array member(s) (2); and ensuring that the microlens array member(s) (2) comprises two
microlens arrays of differing pitches, one overlying the other, thereby creating a form of

Moire interference.
An image (16) framed by an image frame as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3.
