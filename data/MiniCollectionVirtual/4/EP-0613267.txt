<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of transmitting data by modulating a 
frequency multiplex of carriers at a relatively low symbol rate, such as in OFDM. 

According to the inventive method, intersymbol interference is deliberately introduced at 
the transmitter side to reduce cross-talk between data of different carriers at the receiver 

side, such as to simplify an equalizing device in a receiver. The intersymbol interference 
at the transmitter side is introduced after the frequency multiplex modulation has 

taken place, by repeating groups of output symbols produced by an IFFT transformer 
and subsequently shaping these repeated groups by means of symbol-by-symbol scaling 

with coefficients constituting a window function. Subsequent shaped and repeated 
groups of these output symbols mutually overlap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of transmitting a data stream comprising 
subsequent groups of N symbols, N being an integer, said method comprising for each 
of said groups the step of modulating each carrier of a frequency division multiplex of 
N carriers with a distinct symbol from this group for a period exceeding the periods 
between subsequent groups, such that the modulation signals of said carriers have a 
symbol rate at least N times lower than the symbol rate in the data stream and that 
inter-symbol interference in these modulation signals is deliberately introduced. The invention also relates to a transmitter and a receiver for cooperation 
with said transmitter. A method of this type is known from US Patent 4,641,318 by Addeo. The 
known method inter alia provides the possibility of reducing the error probability of 
data transmission via a channel impaired by Rayleigh fading. According to this method 
the symbol period in the modulation signals of the frequency multiplexed carriers is 
rendered larger than the duration of a Rayleigh fading which is characteristic of the 
channel. It prevents that this fading affects all the information in the transmission signal 
on a symbol or a sequence of symbols, which may cause irreparable errors in the data 
received. The known method basically proposes a combination of two measures for 
increasing the symbol period in the transmission signal. Firstly, a data stream I having a 
relatively high bit rate is converted into N parallel sub-data streams at a relatively low 
bit rate. The symbol period in the sub-data streams is N times Ti, the symbol period in 
the data stream I. Secondly, the symbols in the sub-data streams are spread over an 
even longer period than N times Ti. This is effected by time-continuous filtering of the 
sub-datastreams, such as to smear out the symbol energy in time. The filtered sub-data 
streams are applied to a frequency multiplex modulating arrangement, such that each of 
these streams modulate a distinct carrier. Effectively, each symbol of subsequent groups 
of N symbols in the data stream, modulate a distinct carrier for a duration which  
 
exceeds N times Ti. The resulting transmission signal is a frequency multiplex of data 
modulated carriers in which the symbol rate is N times lower than that of the data 
stream, but having inter-symbol interference (ISI) between time-adjacent symbols in the 
modulation signal of each carrier. This ISI is deliberately introduced at the transmitter 
side in view of reducing the
