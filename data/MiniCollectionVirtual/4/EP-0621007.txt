<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a ligaturing and/or suturing system for endoscopic surgery, characterised in that it comprises in combination: a ligaturing or suturing thread (100) which is mounted slidably in the longitudinal channel of a tubular end-piece (120), and a rigid support (200) comprising a grip handle (210) integral with an elongate rod (220) which is provided, at its proximal end (222) remote from the handle (210), with a receiving cradle (224) which is able to receive, in a movable manner, the tubular end-piece (120), and with a lateral window (228) through which the said cradle (224) opens to the outside of the support (200) in order to permit the passage of the thread (110) in such a way that a traction exerted on the distal end (118) of the latter relative to the support (200) provides for the tightening of the ligature or suture.
