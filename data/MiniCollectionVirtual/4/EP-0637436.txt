<ABSTRACT>
A medical probe device comprising a catheter having a stylet 
guide housing with at least one stylet port in a side thereof and 

stylet guide means for directing a flexible stylet outward through 
at least one stylet port and through intervening tissue to targeted 

tissues. The stylet guide housing has an optical viewing means 
positioned for viewing the stylet and adjacent structure which 

includes a fiber optic channel means for receiving a fiber optic 
viewing device. The fiber optic channel means can include a guide 

port means for directing longitudinal movement of a fiber optic 
device with respect to the stylet guide means in a viewing zone and 

a flushing liquid channel in the stylet guide housing having an exit 
port positioned to direct flushing liquid issuing therefrom across 

the end of a fiber optic device when positioned in the viewing zone. 
The optical viewing means can comprise a viewing window positioned 

in the stylet guide housing for viewing the stylet when it is 
directed outward from its respective stylet port. The optical 

viewing means can include a fiber optic channel in the stylet guide 
housing for receiving the a fiber optic viewing device and aligning 

the viewing end thereof with the viewing window. Windowed devices 
can include a flushing liquid channel in the stylet guide housing 

having an exit port positioned to direct flushing liquid issuing 
therefrom across a surface of the viewing window.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a device for 
penetrating body tissues for medical purposes such as tissue ablation 
and fluid substance delivery, for example. The device penetrates 
tissue to the precise target selected in order to deliver 
energy to the tissue and/or deliver substances. It limits this 
treatment to the precise preselected site, thereby minimizing trauma 
to normal surrounding tissue and achieving a greater medical benefit. 
This device is a catheter-like device for positioning a treatment 
assembly in the area or organ selected for medical treatment 
with one or more stylets in the catheter, mounted for extension from 
a stylet port in the side of the catheter through surrounding tissue 
to the tissue targeted for medical intervention. In particular, this invention is directed to a medical probe 
device provided with an optical viewing capability for precise 
positioning of the treatment device. Treatment of cellular tissues usually requires direct contact 
of target tissue with a medical instrument, usually by surgical 
procedures exposing both the target and intervening tissue to 
substantial trauma. Often, precise placement of a treatment probe 
is difficult because of the location of targeted tissues in the body  
 
or the proximity of the target tissue to easily damaged, critical 
body organs, nerves, or other components. Benign prostatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia (BPH), for example, 
is one of the most common medical problems experienced by men 
over 50 years old. Urinary tract obstruction due to prostatic 
hyperplasia has been recognized since the earliest days of medicine. 
Hyperplastic enlargement of the prostate gland often leads to 
compression of the urethra, resulting in obstruction of the urinary 
tract and the subsequent development of symptoms including frequent 
urination decrease in urinary flow, nocturia pain, discomfort, and 
dribbling. The association of BPH with aging has been shown by the 
incidence of BPH in 50 percent of men over 50 years of age and increases 
in incidence to over 75 percent in men over 80 years of age. 
Symptoms of urinary obstruction occur most frequently between the 
ages of 65 and 70 when approximately 65 percent of men in this age 
group have prostatic enlargement. Currently there is no nonsurgical method for treating BPH 
which has proven to be effective. In addition, the surgical procedures 
available were not totally satisfactory. Patients 
suffering from the obstructive symptoms of this disease were provided 
with few options: continue

<CLAIMS>
A medical probe device for the treatment by radio 
frequency ablation of a target volume in tissue of a 

prostate of a body of a human male having a bladder with a 
base and a penis with a urethra therein formed by a urethral 

wall extending into the base of the bladder along a 
longitudinal axis with the tissue of the prostate 

surrounding the urethra near the base of the bladder
