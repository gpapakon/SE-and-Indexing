<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a stable emulsified 
composition which includes an active ingredient which is at 

least one selected from the group consisting of docosahexaenoic 
acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and a derivative thereof, 

or a natural oil containing the above; an emulsifier in 
an amount sufficient to emulsify at least the active ingredient; 

an antioxidant; and a hydrophilic medium. The emulsifier 
is a polyglycerin fatty acid ester having HLB of 10 

or more and 12 to 20 carbon atoms in the fatty acid alone or 
a combination of the polyglycerin fatty acid ester and a 

sucrose fatty acid ester having 12 to 20 carbon atoms in the 
fatty acid and/or a lecithin, and the hydrophilic medium is 

a polyalcohol or a water-containing polyalcohol, and a food 
containing the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a stable emulsified composition
which comprises at least one selected from the group
consisting of docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid
and a derivative thereof, or a natural oil containing the
above. The emulsified composition of the present invention
is useful for various foods, such as beverages, frozen
desserts, confectionary, dairy products, bakery products,
meat and fish products and the like.It has been reported that docosahexanoic acid (hereinafter
referred to DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (hereinafter
referred to EPA), which are a straight-chain polyunsaturated
fatty acid and mainly contained in a fish oil, exert
biological activities such as a cholesterol lowering effect
in blood, anticancer effect, anti-thrombogenic effect,
learning efficiency improving effect and the like, so that
they are currently one of the most promising food materials.However, since EPA has 5 double bonds in the molecule
and DHA has 6 in the molecule, they are readily oxidized
with a trace amount of oxygen, heat, light, oxidation catalyst 
and the like and occur stench of fish peculiar to the
fish oil.In use of the fish oil containing straight-chain polyunsaturated
fatty acids, various techniques have been
proposed to prevent oxidation or occurring of stench of
fish.As examples of the techniques, Japanese Laid-open
Patent Publication Hei 4 (1992)-346749 discloses a powdered
milk containing the fish oil blended with vitamin C and/or
its salt; Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication Hei 2
(1990)-203741 discloses a margarine dispersing capsules
which are prepared by adding tocopherol and/or a lecithin to
polyunsaturated fatty acids, followed by coating with an
edible coating agent; and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication
Hei 6 (1994)-49479 discloses a method for stabilizing
ω -3 unsaturated fatty acids by an emulsifier such as Tween
20, sucrose fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters,
lecithins and the like.US 4,963,385 discloses a stabilised emulsion comprising EPA and DHA, using sugar
alcohols, tocopherol and a fish oil stabilising antioxidant as stabilisers and lecithin, mono-and
diglycerides as an emulsifier. JP-A-60 102 168 discloses a foodstuff comprising
emulsified purified fish oil containing EPA and a water soluble protein, using sugar fatty
acid ester or polyglycerin fatty acid ester as emulsifiers WO 89/02223 discloses food
products containing fish oil stabilised with fructose and an antioxidant.However, sufficient effects were not obtained in any
cases, and more stable
