<ABSTRACT>
Temperature adaptable fibers are provided in which a polyol/glyoxal based crosslinking system is used to create a water-insoluble polyacetal coating. The formaldehyde release properties characteristic of methylolamide finishing agents is avoided. The non-catalytic reaction utilizes stoichiometric amounts of sulfonic acids to derivatize the polyols which in turn react with the glyoxal to form a water-insoluble polymer. The material also possesses improved properties relating to soil release, durable press, resistance to static charge, abrasion resistance, pilling resistance and water absorbency.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TEMPERATURE ADAPTABLE GLYOXAL-MODIFIED FIBERS AND METHOD OF PREPARING SAMEField of the InventionThis invention relates to temperature-adaptable polyacetal modified ibers and the means for their produc¬ tion. Description of the Prior ArtThe concept of preparing a temperature-adaptable hollow fiber has been previously demonstrated and described in U.S. Patent 3,607,591. This invention incorporates a gas into liquid inside the fiber that increases the diameter of the fiber and thus increases its thermal insulation value when the liquid solidifies and the solubility of the gas decreases. However, this invention exhibits serious limitations. It is limited to use with only hollow textile fibers and is only applicable in cold weather situations, i.e., when the environmental temperature drops below the freezing point of the liquid in the fiber. Furthermore, this modified hollow fiber system was not evaluated for its ability to reproduce its thermal effect after various heating and cooling cycles.U.S. Patents 4,851,291 and 4,908,238 describe and demonstrate the concept of preparing temperature-adaptable fibers by means of an in-situ polymerization process. The inventions require that the polyethylene glycols be insolubilized by reaction with cross-linking agents possessing three or more reactive sites; further, the inclusion of specific acid catalysts such as p-toulenesulfonic acid by itself or in a mixture with other acid catalysts such as MgCl2 and citric acid is necessary. U.S. Patent 4,472,167 describes the preparation of formaldehyde-free durable-press finishes on cotton textiles. Glycols possessing a molecular chain length of 2 to 11 atoms are used as corrective additives with glyoxal in the presence of aluminum sulfate catalysts and alpha-hydroxy catalyst activators to create textile finishes exhibiting high levels of wrinkle resistance and smooth drying properties. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that modified textile fibers containing bound polyacetals can be produced by a previously unrecognized reaction involving the in situ polymerization of linear polyethylene glycols with stoichio etric amounts of sulfonic acids and glyoxal; this being done in the presence of the fibrous substrates. The insoluble polyacetal is derived from non-formaldehyde reactants (glyoxal) and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. The resultant polyacetal is insolubilized onto diverse types of natural and synthetic fibers and/or their blends by immersing the fibrous materials in solutions containing the
