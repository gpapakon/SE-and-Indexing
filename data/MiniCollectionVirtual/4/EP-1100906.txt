The present invention relates to inhibitors of the KDEL receptor and therapeutic uses therefor. Certain proteins are functionally retained in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum via an interaction between a KDEL sequence and its receptor. According to the invention, blocking this interaction with a KDEL receptor inhibitor poromotes the secretion of such proteins. In specific embodiments of the invention, KDEL receptor inhibitors may be used to promote the secretion of heat shock proteins, thereby rendering the secreted heat shock proteins more accessible to the immune system and improving the immune response to heat shock protein-associated antigens.

 KDEL RECEPTOR INHIBITORSSPECIFICATION1. INTRODUCTION The present invention relates to inhibitors of the KDEL receptor and therapeutic uses therefor. Certain proteins are functionally retained in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum via an interaction between a KDEL sequence at the protein carboxy terminus and a KDEL-binding receptor. According to the invention, blocking this interaction with a KDEL receptor inhibitor promotes the secretion of such proteins. In specific embodiments of the invention, KDEL receptor inhibitors may be used to promote the secretion of heat shock proteins, thereby rendering the secreted heat shock proteins more accessible to the immune system and improving the immune response to heat shock protein-associated antigens.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A living cell is a complex assembly of molecular elements; to function properly, its constituent molecules must form associations and operate in an organized manner. Certain components bind together to form molecular superstructures, including organelles which compartmentalize cellular activities and filaments which impart order and control motility. Other components exist in soluble form, and may move freely throughout the cell or, alternatively, within a subcellular compartment. Cells are also equipped with elements that synthesize, process, and secrete a designated subset of proteins. This so-called secretory pathway includes membrane associated structures, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, as well as a number of resident soluble molecules which participate in the processing of secreted proteins. Proteins which are to be secreted pass through the Golgi apparatus, where they are packaged for export from the cell. Accompanying them, by virtue of the continual vesicular transport of membrane and endoplasmic reticulum luminal contents, are soluble proteins properly residing in the endoplasmic 

reticulum.To avoid continuously losing and needing to resynthesize these resident proteins, the cell uses a membrane-bound receptor localized in or near the Golgi apparatus for their retrieval (Lewis and Pelham, 1992, Cell 68:353-364). The receptor binds to a specific carboxy-terminal amino acid sequence which serves as a marker of what proteins are to be returned to the endoplasmic reticulum; this sequence is generally lysine-aspartic acid-glutamic acid-leucine (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu in the three- letter amino acid code, KDEL in the single-letter code, referred to herein as "KDEL"), so that the receptor is generally referred to
