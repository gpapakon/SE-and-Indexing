<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for verifying the position of a 
lesion (303) in a patient's body (302) compares the location of the 

lesion 
in CT slices with the position of the lesion (303) in ultrasound 

images taken while the patient lays on the treatment table (404) of 
a linear accelerator (401).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for
verifying the position of a lesion, tumor, abnormal growth, body organ or structure (herein collectively referred to as "lesion") to be treated by a
radiation therapy device operating in accordance with a
radiation therapy plan.Modern day radiation therapy of cancerous tumors, or
lesions, has two goals: eradication of the tumor and avoidance
of damage to healthy tissue and organs present near the tumor.
It is believed that a vast majority of tumors can be
eradicated completely if a sufficient radiation dose is
delivered to the tumor volume; however, complications may
result from use of the necessary effective radiation dose, due
to damage to healthy tissue which surrounds the tumor, or to
other healthy body organs located close to the tumor. The
goal of conformal radiation therapy is to confine the
delivered radiation dose to only the tumor volume defined by
the outer surface of the tumor, while minimizing the dose of
radiation to surrounding healthy tissue or adjacent healthy
organs. Conformal radiation therapy treatment typically uses a
linear accelerator as a source of the radiation being used to
treat the tumor. The linear accelerator typically has a
radiation beam source which is rotated about the patient and
directs the radiation beam toward the tumor, or lesion, to be
treated. Various types of devices have been proposed to
conform the shape of the radiation treatment beam to follow
the spatial contour of the tumor as seen by the radiation
treatment beam as it passes through the patient's body into
the tumor, during rotation of the radiation beam source, which
is mounted on a rotatable gantry of the linear accelerator.
Multileaf collimators, which have multiple leaf, or finger,
projections which can be moved individually into and out of
the path of the radiation beam, can be so programmed, and are
examples of such devices. Various types of radiation
treatment planning systems can create a radiation treatment
plan, which when implemented will deliver a specified dose of
radiation shaped to conform to the lesion, or tumor, volume,
while limiting the radiation dose delivered to sensitive
surrounding healthy tissue or adjacent healthy organs.A basic problem in radiation therapy is knowing where the
target, or lesion or tumor, is located at the time the
radiation therapy treatment is occurring. It is assumed that
the patient's position and the target organ's position within
the patient will be grossly the same at the time of radiation
treatment, as it
