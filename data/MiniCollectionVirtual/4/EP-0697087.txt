<ABSTRACT>
Pulse width modulation is used to control the flow rate through a solenoid expansion valve (24) in a refrigeration system (10) using a dual evaporator, two-stage cycle. The refrigeration cycle (10) includes a phase separator (22) which receives two-phase refrigerant from the low temperature evaporator (20) and supplies liquid refrigerant to the pulse width modulated solenoid valve (24). A liquid level sensor (34) is disposed in the phase separator (22), and a controller (32) for controlling the duty cycle of the pulse width modulated solenoid valve (24) is provided to receive input from the liquid level sensor (34). The liquid level sensor (34) can be of the type which provides a continuously variable signal as a function of liquid level, or it can be a liquid level switch which controls valve duty cycle on the basis of whether the phase separator liquid level is above or below a set level. Alternatively, two liquid level switches (34a, 34b) can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
refrigerant expansion control in refrigeration systems
and more particularly concerns using pulse width
modulated solenoid valves for expansion control. As
used herein, the term "refrigeration system" refers to
refrigerators, air conditioners or any other system
which produces a refrigeration effect.Conventional refrigeration systems used in
household refrigerators typically operate on the
simple vapor compression cycle which includes a
compressor, a condenser, an expansion device, and an
evaporator all connected in series in the order given.
Refrigerator air is blown across the evaporator and
the air flow is controlled so that part of the air
flow goes to the freezer compartment and the remainder
of the air flow goes to the fresh food compartment.
The refrigerator cycle, therefore, produces its
refrigeration effect at a temperature which is
appropriate for the freezer compartment, but lower
than it needs to be for the fresh food compartment. 
Since the mechanical energy required to produce
cooling at low temperatures is greater than it is at
higher temperatures, the simple vapor compression
cycle uses more mechanical energy than one which
produces cooling at two temperature levels.A refrigeration cycle suitable for use in a
household refrigerator and having improved
thermodynamic efficiency is described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,910,972, issued March 27, 1990 to Heinz Jaster
and assigned to the same assignee as the present
invention. The system disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,910,972 has all the features of the preamble of claim 1. This system comprises first and second compressors, a
condenser, a first expansion device, a first
evaporator, a phase separator, a second expansion
device, and a second evaporator all connected in
series in the order given. The phase separator
receives two phase refrigerant from the first
evaporator and provides liquid refrigerant to the
second expansion device and saturated vapor
refrigerant to the second compressor. The first
evaporator is operated at approximately -3,9째C (25째F) and cools
the fresh food compartment; the second evaporator is
operated at approximately -23째C (-10째F) and cools the freezer
compartment. Thus, this dual evaporator, two-stage
cycle uses much less mechanical energy than the
typical single evaporator system.Household refrigerators typically use
capillary tubes as the expansion devices because they
are simple, low cost devices. However, capillary
tubes have a number of limitations as expansion
devices. For instance,
