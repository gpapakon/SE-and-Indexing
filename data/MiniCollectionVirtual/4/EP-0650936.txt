<ABSTRACT>
An electric lamp having a light source, glass envelope 
made of a lead free glass, electric leads, and contacts, is 

disclosed. The compositional range of the envelope glass 
may be used in existing lamp manufacturing equipment, and 

otherwise substantially meets the manufacturing and product 
requirements normally met only by lead glass. The resulting 

lamp product has the same cost, and product performance, but 
now has the environmentally desirable feature of being lead 

free.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electric lamps and
particularly to lamps made with glass envelopes or glass
mounts. More particularly the invention is concerned with
an electric lamp made with a lead free glass composition.Lead for centuries has played an important role in
making glass the common, easily formed, low cost material
that it is. Lead in glass lowers the softening and melting
points of glass making the glass workable at lower
temperatures. There is now a environmental effort to
eliminate lead from products commonly discarded in
landfills, including glass products such as electric lamps.
Conceptually, the elimination of lead from glass is simple.
One needs merely to remove lead from the existing
formulations and melt and work the lead free formulation at
a higher temperature. This is not a practical solution.
For example, lead glasses are commonly used to make electric
lamps, where the lamp cost depends largely on the raw
material cost, the speed at which glass can be formed
(equipment utilization speed) and the energy cost of
processing the glass. Simply removing lead from glass
formulas would then require re-equiping factories to operate
with higher temperature glass, and paying the continuing
higher fuel costs.Most known lead free glasses would be impractical in
existing lamp making equipment, since the melting and
softening points are too high, thereby requiring excessive
amounts of fuel. Alternatively, the material may have too
high or too low a viscosity, thereby flowing too quickly or
to slowly. The forming machinery would then need to be
adjusted to accommodate the more or less fluid material. 
Also, the pressing, bending, and blowing of the glass as the
case may be, would need re-adjustment to accommodate the new
material. As a result, simple elimination of lead would
then drive up the manufacturing cost of electric lamps
substantially. For these reasons there is a need for a lead
free glass that has nearly the same mechanical working
characteristics as the leaded glass used before.There are numerous low lead and lead free glass
formulations, however they are generally not suitable for
most incandescent and fluorescent lighting products. Most
glass tubing used to make lamps is made by the Vello tube
drawing process. The Vello process produces tubes with
excellent dimensional quality at very high drawing speeds,
but forms the glass tubing at relatively high viscosities,
thereby requiring glass compositions having low liquidus
temperatures. Lead glasses typically melt at lower
temperatures,
