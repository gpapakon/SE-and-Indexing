<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed apparatus provides an output indicating a 
time difference between a first input pulse and a second 

pulse. The first input pulse is provided to and circulated 
in a signal delay means. The number of rounds of circulation 

of the first input pulse in the signal delay means is 
separately counted. According to the number of rounds of 

circulation of the first pulse and an increment of the delay 
means, an outut is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
A prior art technique encodes a phase 
difference between two pulses PA and PB into a digital 
signal composed of a plurality of bits that represent a 
positive or negative shift (difference) between phases 
of the two pulses PA and PB. The detection range of the 
phase shift of this technique can be expanded without 
deteriorating the detection accuracy by increasing the 
number of bite of the digital signal. The increase in the number of bits, however, 
increases circuit scale. If the circuit scale must be 
kept as it is, the detection range is expandable only by 
sacrificing the detection accuracy. When phases of two pulses PA and PB change in 
response to a change in a physical quantity, it is 
possible to find the change in the physical quantity by 
detecting a difference between the phases. Based on 
this idea, a sensor can be made. This sort of sensor 
must have a wide detection range and high detection 
accuracy to respond to sensing elements that cause large 
phase changes or have a variety of characteristics to 
cause a large phase difference. Further, for the sake 
of compactness and economy, the size of the sensor must 
not be increased excessively. An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus 
for producing an indication of a time difference between two 
pulses, having  
 
a wide range, compact circuit scale, and high 
accuracy. In order to accomplish the object, the present invention 
provides an apparatus in accordance with the claims.  According to the present invention, a first pulse 
PA is circulated in the delay means. 
Even if the 
number of the signal delay circuits is small, i.e., even 
with a small circuit scale, the counting means (2) counts the 
number of rounds of circulation of the first pulse in 
the signal delay circuits, and the counted number of 
rounds forms upper bits of a digital signal having a 
high resolution for indicating a phase difference.
