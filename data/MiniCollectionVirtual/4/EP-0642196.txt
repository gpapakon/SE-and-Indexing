<ABSTRACT>
A bulb socket that avoids the various 
disadvantages caused by insert molding of a terminal of a 

complicated shape and also satisfies characteristics 
required for different portions of the terminal. A 

housing body (11) is made of a plastic material and includes a 
socket housing (12) for receiving a base portion (3) of a bulb (B) and 

a connector housing (13) for receiving a feeder connector. 
Each connector-side terminal (20) is of a generally L-shape and 

has a connector tab portion (22) and a relay tab portion (21) 
extending perpendicularly from this connector tab portion. 

Bulb-side terminals (30) are provided in the socket housing (12) at 
corner portions thereof in opposed relation to each other 

and function to mechanically hold the base portion (3) of the 
bulb (B), and also function to electrically contact lead wires (4) 

on the base portion (3), respectively. This bulb-side 
terminal (30) has a relay terminal portion (36) formed at a lower 

end thereof, which portion can be press-fitted on the 
relay tab portion (21) of the connector-side terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bulb socket with a connector,
and more particularly to a bulb socket having an improved
terminal construction, as well as a method of producing
such a bulb socket.In a bulb socket of this kind, a connector housing is
formed integrally with a socket housing of a plastic material,
and terminals are provided therein. Conventionally,
this terminal includes an integral bulbside terminal portion
exposed in the socket housing for contact with a bulb
and an integral connector-side terminal portion exposed in
the connector housing for contact with a feeder connector,
and this terminal is fixed to the housing by insert molding
during the molding of the socket housing.In the bulb socket of the above construction, however,
the terminal has a complicated shape, and therefore there
has been encountered a problem that the cost of a mold for
insert molding is high. Because the terminal is large in
size and is complicated in shape, the dimensional accuracy
of the terminal is poor. As a result, there have arisen
problems in that resin flows into the terminal during insert
molding, the terminal interferes with and may be deformed
by a mold, and the retaining of the terminal by the
mold becomes inadequate, so that the deformation of the
terminal by a resin injecting pressure, as well as an improper
flow of the resin, can easily develop. Moreover, because
of the complicated shape of the terminal, it is, in
some cases, difficult to use an automation system employing
a part feeder, which is disadvantageous from the viewpoint
of manufacturing costs.Furthermore, since the terminal is of an integral construction
formed from a single electrically-conductive
plate, the bulb-side terminal portion for contact with the
bulb and the connector-side terminal portion for contact 
with the connector are made of the same material. However,
for example, the connector-side terminal portion should
preferably have a plate thickness of about 0.6 mm in connection
with the associated connector, whereas the
bulb-side terminal portion should preferably have a plate
thickness of about 0.4 mm to secure a contact pressure with
the bulb. Thus, despite the fact that the characteristics
required for different portions are different, these could
not be satisfied with the conventional terminal.JP-U-01 086085, an English language summary thereof can
be found in EP-A-0 668 638, discloses a bulb socket from
which the present invention starts from. This known bulb
socket has a main body formed with a bulb receptacle in
which a bulb
