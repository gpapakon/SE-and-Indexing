<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for centrically charging tanks (9) with a spin chamber (1, 10) connected to the inlet (20) and to a vertical downpipe (2, 12) ending seamlessly in a trumpet-shaped mouth (3, 18). The invention is noteworthy in that use is made of the rotary flow for charging circular settlement tanks and sand sorters and sedimentation tanks in such a way that the Coanda effect is activated at the trumpet-shaped mouth (3, 18) and in turn causes the rotary outflow of fluid from the vertical pipe (2, 12) to be diverted into the horizontal plane or vertically upwards as well as a radially symmetrical flow in the tank (9), and in that there is, in particular, a guiding pipe (14, 16) in the downpipe (2, 12) with preferably circular apertures around its periphery and which is open to the atmosphere at the top.

A device for the central feeding of tanks such as circular
grit tanks and grit classifiers and settling tanks of circular

construction having a swirl chamber which is connected to the
inflow and is in connection with the vertical gravity outlet

pipe, a trumpet-shaped widening adjoining the gravitiy outlet
pipe in a seamless manner, wherein rotary flow having angular

momentum is utilized for feeding such that there is activated,
at the trumpet-shaped widening (3), the Coanda effect which, for

its part, causes a deflection of the liquid stream, emerging
from the downpipe (2) and having angular momentum, at least in

the horizontal direction or vertically upwards and also causes
a radially symmetrical drain-off in the tank, characterized in

that a control disk placed into the downpipe (2) or into the
trumpet-shaped widening (3) is renounced upon and that there is

arranged, in particular, a conduit pipe (16), centrally in the
gravity outlet pipe (10), which has preferably circular openings

over its circumference and is open at the top towards the
atmosphere.
The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the supply of
air of the conduit pipe (16) is designed such that it can be

regulated.
The device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the supply of
air takes place via a compulsory feed means.
The apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
wherein the deflection angle of the trumpet-shaped or toroidal

body (3) is designed such that it can be changed.
The apparatus as claimes in one of the preceding claims,
wherein the conduit pipe (16) is configured in a manner

coresponding to a vortex sink and is provided with holes of
corresponding size, distributed uniformly over the

circumferential surfaces. 
The device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the position at
which the trumpet-shaped widening (18) is suspended can be

changed.
The device as claimed in claim 1, in particular
for promoting a separation by flotation including liquid/liquid

separation, for example grease separation, wherein
an upstream immersed baffle (24) is provided at a defined

distance from the tank edge (26).
The device as claimed in claim 7, wherein an
inner immersed baffle (30) running helically towards the

center is arranged within the upstream immersed
baffle (24).
The device as claimed in one of claims 7 and 8,
wherein the upstream immersed baffle (43) reaches as far

as the tank cover (44) and is connected rigidly thereto;
and an open top gravity discharge (42) is provided.
The device as claimed in one of claims 7 to 9,
wherein the tank wall (50) is taken as far as the cover

(44), is connected thereto in a sealed manner and, via
peripheral slots (48) in the tank wall, a pressure

discharge of the liquid to a pipe (46) encircling the
tank is provided.
The device as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
space (40) containing floating substances and air in an

increasingly compressed state and located above the
liquid level can be emptied via a discharge pipe (42)

which opens discontinuously.
A process for central feeding tanks such as circular grit
traps, and grit classifiers and settling tanks of circular

construction by means of a vertical downpipe, a trumpet-shaped
widening adjoining the gravity outlet pipe in a seamless manner,

wherein a swirl is produced in order to activate the so-called
Coanda effect, the Coanda effect being utilized such that it

serves on the one hand for separation of the mineral
constitutents entrained in the liquid phase and for the

decelerated and uniform introduction, having angular momentum, 
into the
 circular tank, characterized in that an air intake is
provided in the center of the vortex core arising as a result of

the tangential introduction, and that a control disk to be
placed into the downpipe or into the trumped-shaped widening is

renounced upon.
The process as claimed in claim 12, wherein the swirl is
utilized such that swirl effect and Coanda effect are

intensified synergistically.
The process as claimed in one of claims 12 or 13, wherein
flocculating agents are added to the air intake from the top.
Use of the device according to one of claims 1-11 for the
central feeding of tanks such as settling tanks, circular grit

traps, flotation tanks and grit classifiers of circular
construction for liquid/liquid separation, the separation of

solids and liquids, for example as grease trap, or the
separation of shredded refuse and sewage, or as petrol

separator.
