<ABSTRACT>
A distillation column for separating a liquid mixture into a plurality of pure fractions, the distillation column being subdivided in its central area into two parts, a feed part (2) and a take-off part (3) by a partition acting in the longitudinal direction, the partition comprising two walls (4) having a gas space (5) lying in between, the distance between the two walls being 1 to 50 mm, preferably 3 to 10 mm.

<CLAIMS>
A distillation column (1) for separating a liquid mixture
into a plurality of pure fractions, the distillation column

being divided into 2 parts, a feed part and a take-off part
(2; 3), in its middle region by a separation means effective

in the longitudinal direction and the separation consisting
of 2 walls (4) with a thermally insulating layer (5) in

between, wherein the separation means consists of 2 walls
with a gas space (5) in between and wherein the distance

between the two walls is from 1 to 50 mm, preferably from 3
to 10 mm, and wherein a gas stream (6; 7), preferably

nitrogen, is passed in at one end of the separation means,
preferably the upper end, which stream emerges from the

separation means, preferably at the opposite end, and is
passed directly into the column or is passed in at the top of

the column.
A distillation column as claimed in claim 1, wherein the separation
means possesses, on both sides or on the side which

has the lower operating temperatures of the column, liquid
deflectors which deflect liquid from the separation means and

thus create a gas cushion from 1 to 50 mm, preferably from 5

to 20 mm thick between the separation means and column
baffles wet with liquid.
A distillation column as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
material of the liquid deflectors is not perforated or, where

stacked packings comprising wire fabric or perforated
material are used, has a flow-through pressure loss which is

at least equal to or preferably higher than that of the
stacked packing.
