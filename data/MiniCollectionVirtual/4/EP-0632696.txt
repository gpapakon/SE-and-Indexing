<ABSTRACT>
A petroleum wax-free chewing gum with enhanced flavor release, particularly chewing gums with increased perception of breath freshening, are disclosed. Enhanced flavor release is obtained with wax-free chewing gums where the Solubility Parameter, defined as delta = 2ROOT  rho  SIGMA Ei/M.W. of at least 5 % of the flavoring agent is at least 0.5 units greater than, or less than, the average weighted Solubility Parameter of the gum base used to formulate the wax-free chewing gums of our invention. The greater the difference in Solubility Parameter of flavoring ingredients to the average weighted Solubility Parameter of the wax-free gum bases, the greater the tendency for enhanced flavor release.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PETROLEUM WAX-FREE CHEWING GUMS HAVING IMPROVED FLAVOR RELEASEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to improved chewing gum bases of the type which contain no petroleum waxes and to chewing gum products containing these petroleum wax-free gum bases. The invention emphasizes the use of flavoring ingredients having certain characteristics in these petroleum wax-free gum bases to ensure improved or rapid flavor release of these flavoring ingredients incorporated into the petroleum wax-free chewing gums.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONU.S. Patent No. 3,984,574, issued to Comollo, which patent is incorporated herein by reference, discloses abhesive chewing gums and abhesive chewing gum bases where non-tack properties are achieved by eliminating conventional chewing gum base ingredients found to contribute to chewing gum tackiness and by substituting therefore non-tacky ingredients. Specifi¬ cally, Comollo discovered that three classes of-_>A materials account for conventional chewing gum tackiness. These tacky materials were certain natural elastomers, certain resins and the petroleum waxes.Comollo eliminated natural and certain synthetic elastomers from his chewing gum bases and 

substituted in their place one or more non-tacky synthetic elastomers such as polyisobutylene, polyisoprene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymer, and styrene-butadiene copolymers. Comollo also eliminated the tack producing natural resins and modified natural resins and used instead relatively high amounts of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils or animal fats. Finally, Comollo completely excluded waxes from the gum bases but substituted polyvinyl acetate, fatty acids, and certain mono and diglycerides of fatty acids.Comollo did not specifically recognize any particular difference in the release of lavoring agents or lavoring ingredients from his reformulated wax-free gum bases or chewing gums. We have now discovered that certain wax-free chewing gum bases and wax-free chewing gums formulated with these wax-free bases provide for very rapid and perceptually seemingly immediate release of certain flavoring agents. This apparent rapid rate of flavor release is not observed with chewing gums formulated with paraffin waxes, or in general with petroleum waxes. This rapid release is also not observed with certain flavors. We have now determined those characteristics of the flavoring agents and their flavoring ingredients which, when formulated with petroleum wax-free gum bases, lead to rapid release of flavor. When
