A process for preparing tertiary butylamine having a 
purity of at least 99.5%, which can be used directly 

without further purification, by reacting isobutene 
and ammonia in the gas phase in a reactor over a 

dealuminised silica-alumina catalyst, the catalyst 
being present in acid form,
 
characterised in that 


a) the catalyst has a crystallinity of at least 95%, 
b) the Na
2
O content of the catalyst is less than 
0.2 wt.%, 
c) the Si/Al ratio of the catalyst is from 7 up to 
397, 
d) the degree of carbonisation of the catalyst is 
less than 1% in 200 hours and less than 1.5% in 

400 hours, 
e) the molar ratio of ammonia to isobutene is from 
0.3 up to 10:1, 
f) the reaction temperature is 200°C to 350°C, 
g) the pressure is 100 bar to 250 bar, 
h) the ratio of educts to catalyst is from 5 up to 
60 mol/kg catalyst per hour and 
i) the unreacted educts are separated from the 
tertiary butylamine formed. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
technical isobutene (purity 
<
 99.5%) is used. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
pure isobutene (purity 
>
 99.9%) is used. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the ratio of educts to catalyst 

is from 10 to 30 mol/kg cat. h.  
 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the molar ratio of ammonia to 

isobutene is from 0.9:1 to 4:1. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the catalyst contains less than 

0.05% Na
2
O. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the separation of the educts is 

carried out by means of distillation. 
A process according to claim 7, characterised in that 
ammonia and isobutene are removed as an azeotrope 

during the distillation. 
A process according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the distillation is carried out at a pressure of from 

1 bar to 30 bar, but preferably at 30 bar. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the unreacted products are 

returned in liquid form to the reaction. 
A process according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the recirculating ammonia and isobutene in the liquid 

state are compressed to the reaction pressure and are 
heated to the required reaction temperature. 
A process according to claims 10 to 11, characterised 
in that a small split stream is diverted and is 

purified of inert constituents (for example, 
isobutane), before being returned to the process. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the reactor is started up by 

means of the following steps:  
 


a) repeated flushing with N
2
 for complete removal of 
the air, 
b) heating up to the operating temperature, 
c) flushing with ammonia, 
d) adjustment of the operating pressure under an 
atmosphere of ammonia, 
e) metering of isobutene into the reactor up to the 
required molar ratio, 
f) after adjustment of the stationary reaction 
equilibrium, charging of the educts in the 

required molar ratio and corresponding continuous 
withdrawal of the reaction mixture.
