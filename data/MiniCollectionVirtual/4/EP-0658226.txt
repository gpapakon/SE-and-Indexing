<ABSTRACT>
A water-containing aromatic polyamide pulp which has been surface-treated with an epoxy resin and has a water-content of 30 to 95 % by weight. This pulp is produced by dispersing an aromatic polyamide pulp in an aqueous epoxy resin emulsion, filtering the mixture and then dehydrating the pulp separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an 
aromatic polyamide pulp surface-treated with an epoxy 
resin and to a process for producing the same. More 
particularly, it relates to a water-containing aromatic 
polyamide pulp which is suitable to uses requiring a 
step of dispersing aromatic polyamide pulp in water to 
make paper as in the production of wet type clutch 
facing, insulating paper and the like, and gives a 
product which can be easily handled and has excellent 
mechanical characteristics, and to a process for 
producing the same. Aromatic polyamides such as poly(paraphenylene 
terephthalamide), poly(metaphenylene isophthalamide) and 
the like (referred to hereinafter as aramides in some 
cases) have been known to be useful for fiber, pulp, 
fiLm and the like which are excellent in heat resistance, 
mechanical characteristics, electric characteristics 
and the like. In particular, aramid pulp 
obtained by fibrillating aramid fibers is useful as 
asbestos-substitutes.  
 Processes for producing aramid pulp have 
here-tofore been proposed. As an example, Japanese Pat. 
Appln. Kokoku No. 59-603 discloses a process for producing 
aramid pulp by forming a film-like material or a 
monofilament from an optically anisotropic dope of paraaromatic 
polyamide and then fibrillating the film-like 
material or monofilament by a mechanical shear force. Japanese Pat. Appln. Kokai No. 2-200,809 
discloses a process for producing aramid pulp directly 
from a solution of a polymer of a meta-aromatic polyamide, 
and apparatus to be used therein. When aramid fibers are to be used as reinforcing 
fibers, it is important that the aramid fibers 
are excellent in wettability and adhesiveness to a resin 
or rubber which is a matrix, and hence, various methods 
have been proposed for the purpose of improving the 
wettability and adhesiveness between aramid fiber and 
matrix. Japanese Pat. Appln. Kokai No. 62-218,425, for 
example, discloses a method of improving the adhesiveness 
between an aramid fiber and an epoxy resin by 
immersing or spray-coating an aramid material (short 
fiber, long fiber, woven fabric, sheet or the like) in 
or with an organic solvent solution of an epoxy resin 
and also subjecting the same to heat-treatment to apply 
the-epoxy resin to the surface of the aramid material. 
In addition, Japanese Pat. Appln. Kokai No. 62-225,539 
discloses a method of improving the adhesiveness of an  
 
aramid material to an epoxy resin by heat-treating the 
aramid material in the presence of an ammonia gas 
before applying
