<ABSTRACT>
An electrical capacitor has two plastic foils (films), which are wound up, provided with metal layers and, on their long sides opposite one another, provided with metal-free edge strips. The metal layers of a foil (1) are subdivided by metal-free zones (6) into individual segments (2) and have a completely metallised edge strip (3) in the edge region. Two to five protective constrictions (4), which have a width b to spacing s ratio b/s of between 0.4 and 1.4 mm/mm, are arranged between the completely metallised edge strip (3) and the individual segments (2), for each segment.
