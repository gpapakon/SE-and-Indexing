<ABSTRACT>
Seat belt which when in the applied state displays a message (3) on the visible outer surface (2) of the belt (1). The message may be printed directly onto the visible surface. Alternatively the message may be sprayed onto the surface, worked into the surface by machining, woven into the surface, or applied as a metal layer by vapour deposition. The message may also be attached by a removable sticker.

<CLAIMS>
A holding belt as is used for example as a safety belt in motor
vehicles and aircraft, in ski lifts, in relation to parachutes or in sailing boats

or as a carrier belt in relation to rucksacks, school satchels, support
structures and in prams, having at least one information carrier (6) which is

glued on to at least parts of its visible surface (2) and on which is arranged
at least one item of information (3), characterised in that the information

carrier (6) is formed from an elastically stretchable textile material whose
material properties are matched to the belt material in terms of the stretch

characteristics thereof.
A belt according to claim 1 characterised in that the information
carrier (6) is releasably joined to the surface (2) of the belt (1).
A belt according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the
information carrier (6) is formed from a flexible material.
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the
material of the information carrier (6) is matched to the belt material at

least in a temperature range of from minus 10°C to 40°C.
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that the
material of the information carrier (6) is fire-resistant.
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the
material of the information carrier (6) is easily cuttable.
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that the
information carrier (6) is writable. 
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that the
information carrier (6) is printed upon on its outside (15) which is remote

from the visible surface (2) of the belt (1).
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that the
information carrier (6) is transparent and is printed upon on its inside

surface (9) which is towards the visible surface (2).
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that at
least parts of the information carrier (6) are provided with a metallised

metal layer.
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in that the
information carrier (6) is of a strip-shaped configuration.
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in that the
belt (1) together with the information (3) arranged thereon can be rolled

into a belt housing (8).
A belt according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in that the
visible surface (2) of the belt (1) is partially provided with a reflecting layer.
A process for the production of a holding belt which is used for
example as a safety belt in motor vehicles and aircraft or in ski lifts, in

relation to parachutes or in sailing boats or as a carrier belt for example in
relation to rucksacks, school satchels, support structures and/or in prams,

and which is provided by adhesive means on at least a part of its visible
surface with at least one information carrier (6) containing an item of

information, characterised in that a textile elastically stretchable material is
selected for the information carrier (6), said material being matched in

respect of its stretch characteristics to a material forming the holding belt. 
A process according to claim 14 characterised in that the
adhesive (10) of the information carrier (6) is provided for the purposes of

intermediate storage with a protective foil which can be pulled off.
