<ABSTRACT>
A microporous olefing substrate coated with pressure sensitive adhesive. The microporous olefin substrate has the property of entrapping a plasticizer migrating from plasticized polymeric surfaces to which it is applied, particularly plasticized polyvinylchloride. The microporous olefin substrate is preferably formed of a high molecular weight polyolefin such as a microporous high molecular weight polyethylene. The sheeting preferably is heat resistant so that it does not distort, crease or wrinkle when applied to a plasticized surface and exposed to elevated temperatures such as 400  DEG F (204  DEG C).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to microporous sheeting particularly 
microporous polyethylene sheeting coated with pressure sensitive adhesive 
useful as labelstock and architectural sign substrates. Various types of adhesive coated polymeric sheetings are known 
in the art. For example, adhesive coated polyvinylchloride film has been used 
as pressure sensitive labelstock in applications where the label will not be 
exposed to elevated temperatures, since the polyvinylchloride label tends to 
deform and shrink when exposed to higher than ambient temperatures. A multilayer polymeric label for example, of polypropylene 
coextruded with a skin layer of acrylonitrile, butadiene or polystyrene is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,713,273. Such labels may be readily coated with 
conventional pressure sensitive adhesives and have a greater resistance to 
deformation when exposed to elevated temperatures than polyvinylchloride film 
labels. Polymeric sheetings of low or medium density polyethylene film 
having a thickness between 0.05 mm and 0.127 mm are disclosed in U.S. 
Patent Re. 32,929. Such sheetings are deformable and when adhesive coated 
can be directly applied onto plastic substrates. These sheetings are alleged to 
conform readily to the shape of the substrate surface to which they are applied 
without wrinkling or cracking.  
 Plasticized polymeric articles, for example, plasticized 
polyvinylchloride substrates or plasticized polyvinylchloride bottles are difficult 
to decorate with conventional adhesive coated film labels. The plasticizer 
contained in the polyvinylchloride article tends to migrate to the surface of the 
article and into the pressure sensitive adhesive interface between the substrate 
and sheeting. Migration of plasticizer occurs slowly even under ambient 
conditions, however the rate of migration tends to increase when the article is 
exposed to elevated temperatures. Plasticizer migration into the pressure 
sensitive adhesive layer reduces the adhesive bond between the sheeting and the 
plasticized substrate. Degradation of the adhesive bond can result in fraying 
along the edges of the label, lifting of portions of the label from the article 
and/or accumulation of dirt. The problem of plasticizer migration from a 
plasticized polyvinylchloride substrate into a contacting adhesive layer resulting 
in loss of adhesion is described, for example, in U.S. Patent Re. 32,929 at 
col. 5, lines 43-57. A class of multilayered sheetings known in the art as heat 
transferable sheetings can be
