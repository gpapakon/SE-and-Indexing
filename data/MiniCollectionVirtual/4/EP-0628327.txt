<ABSTRACT>
This ski, particularly an alpine ski, includes a gliding sole (1), optionally bordered by edges (20, 21) joined to the topsheet (upper face) (4) directly or by means of vertical or sloping sidewalls (7). The topsheet (4) has a profile which is in relief, defining at least two panels (6, 8) which are not parallel to the surface of the gliding sole (1) and the intersection of which defines at least one ridge (5) extending longitudinally over at least a portion of the ski and asymmetrically with respect to the median longitudinal plane of the gliding sole of the said ski.

Ski, except jump ski, including a running sole (1), optionally bordered by edges (20, 
21) joined to the upper face (4) directly or via vertical or inclined sidewalls (7), said 

upper face (4) presenting a relief profile defining, in cross section, at least two side 
faces (6, 8) not parallel to the base of the running sole (1), the intersection of which 

defining at least one imaginary ridge (5) extending lengthwise over at least part of the 
ski, characterized in that the imaginary ridge (5) extends asymmetrically with respect 

to the longitudinal mid-plane of the sole of said ski. 
Ski according to Claim 1, characterized in that the projection of the ridge (5) onto a 
plane parallel to the surface of the sole (1) is of winding shape. 
Ski according to Claim 1, characterized in that the projection of the ridge (5) onto a 
plane parallel to the surface of the sole (1) is straight. 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the ridge (5) is continuous 
from the region of the heel (2) to the region of the tip (3), and in that the profile 

constituted by the projection of the ridge onto a plane perpendicular to the base of the 
sole and directed parallel to the axis of symmetry (18) thereof is substantially curved 

and has no point of inflexion, the culminant point of the ridge being positioned in the 
region of the central zone (10). 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the ridge (5) is 
discontinuous and located at certain portions of the ski. 
Ski according to Claim 5, characterized in that it comprises two ridges, respectively 
forward (24) and rear (25) with respect to the region of the central zone (10), the 

latter being substantially planar and parallel to the base of the sole (1). 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the two slopes (6, 8) defined 
by the ridge (5, 24, 25) and the upper end of the lateral sidewalls (7) or of the 

edges (20, 21) in the absence of sidewalls, are either both concave or convex or one is  
 

concave and the other is convex. 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the projection of the ridge (5) into a 

plane perpendicular to the base of the running sole (1) 
and directed parallel to the axis of symmetry (18) 

thereof has at least one or even more than one point of 
inflexion (12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20) thereby defining a 

central raised platform (11) or a central recess (14) at 
the level of the central zone (10). 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the angle α at the apex of the ridge (5, 

9, 17, 24, 25, 32) is constant all along the ski. 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the angle α at the apex of the ridge (5, 

9, 17, 24, 25, 32) is constant all along the ski. 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that it is asymmetrical, and in that the two 

skis constituting one and the same pair are optical 
isomers of each other. 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the projection of the ridge (5) onto the 

plane defined by the base of the sole (1) is substantially 
tangent to the lower border of the right or left 

ski in question at the level of the central zone (10). 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that it comprises two ridges (9, 17) on one or 

more portions in question. 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 13, characterized 
in that each of the side faces (6, 8) extending 

on either side of the ridge (5, 24, 25) are made of 
different kinds of material, chosen in particular from 

the group comprising ABS (acryl-butylene styrene ) , 
polyurethanes, polyethylenes, glass laminates and aluminum-based 

alloys. 
Ski according to one of Claims 1 to 14, characterized 
in that the region of positioning of the constituent 

elements of the bindings has a surface consisting 
of at least two side faces (6, 8) which are 

inclined with respect to the surface of the sole (1).
