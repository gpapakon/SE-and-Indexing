<ABSTRACT>
The machine (1) has a base (3), a fixed arm (4) 
connected to the base (3) and defining an inverted "U"-shaped 

configuration having a free end. A conventional bead 
extractor (5) is connected to the free end of the fixed arm 

(4), which overlies a rotatable tire-supporting platform (6) 
driven by a drive unit (13). The rotatable platform (6) is 

mounted on a plate (11) having opposite sides provided with 
bearings movably connected to a pair of parallel guide 

elements (18) fixed to the sides of the base (3). A fine-adjustment 
mechanism (14-16) is provided for positioning the 

plate (11) and the rotatable platform (6) with respect to 
the bead extractor (5) and the fixed arm (4) for 

accommodating a wide range of different sizes of wheels and 
tires.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for mounting
tires on and removing tires from wheel rims of any diameter.Machines for mounting and removing tires of vehicles
from their respective wheel rims are known.In practice, these machines consist of a base frame on
which a horizontal rotating platform is provided; said
platform has claws that clamp the wheel rim during the tire
removal operation, which is performed in practice with the
aid of a so-called bead extractor. The bead extractor has an
arm that is shaped like an inverted U, and is mounted
eccentrically on the frame of the machine. A specific
fixture is supported on the arm in a cantilevered manner in
the direction of the platform and is adapted to act between
the sidewall of the tire and the wheel rim itself.Since wheel rim diameters may vary both according to
the type of the vehicles and according to their purpose,
said arm is mounted so that it can move with respect to the
center of the rotating platform in order to increase, if
required, the useful space available for the horizontal
support of the wheel between the upright which is fixed to
the frame and the center of the platform.This structural arrangement only partially solves the
problem of multiple diameters. Movement of the arm is in
fact limited in its extent both by the structure of the
machine and by the space occupied during use, but most of
all, when the arm is moved there is a considerable increase
in the moment of flexure that discharges at the base where
said arm is coupled to the frame of the machine. This entails the need to size the cross-sections so as
to withstand said moment of flexure without breaking, and
oversizing is necessary to take into account the
eccentricity that said working arm can assume.Considerable cross-sections and thickness of material
are thus required, increasing the manufacturing and sales
costs.Furthermore, as mentioned, the extent of the movements
of the arm is limited, so that it is not possible to process
wheel rims of many diameters with a single machine.A final requirement is the capability of working on
wheels that have small diameters, which are notoriously more
rigid on their sides, with the smallest possible lever arm
for the tool.FR-A-2 128 724 discloses a tire changer including a
fixed tire mounting platform having at one end a fixed wheel
supporting assembly mounting a pair of fixed mutually spaced
apart chucks. At an opposite end of the platform, a movable
wheel chuck is slidably guided, and centrally disposed
between the fixed and

<CLAIMS>
Machine (1) for mounting tires (2) on and removing
tires (2) from wheel rims of any diameter, comprising a box-like

base (3) from which a fixed arm (4) rises
eccentrically, said arm being shaped like an inverted U and

supporting a bead extractor fixture (5) at one free end
directed towards the base, a rotating wheel supporting

platform (6) protruding from the opposite upper face (3a) of
said base, said platform being provided with and supporting

conventional means for securing the wheel rim to the
platform, said platform further being mounted on means (7)

that can slide horizontally with respect to said base with a
stroke that can be finely adjusted by virtue of appropriate

elements (8) such that the platform supporting the securing
means for the wheel and the wheel secured thereto all

slidably move with respect to the base, said stroke being
orientated in a direction that converges/diverges with

respect to said arm, said sliding means being supported by
guiding devices (9) which are rigidly coupled to the base,

elements (10) for seating the tire mounted on the wheel rim
being furthermore provided.
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that
said horizontally sliding means comprise a quadrangular

plate (11), two opposite sides of which have conventional
antifriction devices, a drive unit (13) being supported, by

means of associated brackets (12), below said plate, said
drive unit rotating the platform and the wheel rim securing

means supported on the platform.
Machine according to any one or more of claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the fine stroke adjustment elements

are constituted by a worm screw (14) which is actuated from
outside by means of a handwheel (15) and is supported by the

base, said worm screw engaging a corresponding coaxial
sleeve (16) that protrudes from the plate.
Machine according to any one or more of claims 1 and
2, characterized in that said fine stroke adjustment

elements comprise a double-action pneumatic ally- or
hydraulically-operated actuator (17) interposed between said

plate and the box-like base.
Machine according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said guiding devices

comprise two profiled elements (18) that have a C-shaped
cross-section which are arranged mutually opposite and

horizontally parallel and are rigidly coupled to the
corresponding sides of the box-like base proximate to the

top of said base, the corresponding sides of the plate
provided with antifriction devices engaging in said profiled

elements.
Machine according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said tire seating

means comprise at least one roller (19) which has a vertical
rotation axis, is mounted eccentrically on an associated

horizontal secondary arm (20) which is articulated to the
upper face of the box-like base, proximate to the arm, so

that it can rotate from an active position in which it is in
forced contact with the tread of the mounted tire to an

inactive position which is directed away from said tire.
