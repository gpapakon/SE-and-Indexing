<CLAIMS>
A device for detecting the registration error between the 
individual colours during multicolour printing in a long 

web-fed rotary press 

having a scanning device (24), which for each 
measurement point comprises a fibre-optic scanning 

head (25 to 27) for register marks (P1 to P4) 
printed in different colours on a web of material 

(7), 
having an evaluation device (33) interacting with 
the scanning device (24) for determining the 

relative positions of the individual register marks 
(P1 to P4), 
characterised
in that
 each scanning head (25 to 27) comprises only 
one single fibre-optic web scanner (T
1
, T
2
, T
3
) for 
the register marks (P1 to P4) which are disposed in 

alignment behind one another and spaced from one 
another when seen in the direction of movement (L) 

of the web of material (7), 
in that
 by means of a rising edge (V1) of a first 
signal (S1) produced by the respective web scanner 

(T
1
, T
2
, T
3
) a counter is started, which is stopped 
with the rising edge (V2) of a second signal (S2) 

produced by the respective web scanner (T
1
, T
2
, T
3
), 
with the counter counting pulses produced by a 

transmitter (30, 31 and 32 respectively) in the time 
( t) between start and stop, the sum of which 

corresponds to the spacing (A) of the register marks 
(P1 to P4). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 to select the register marks (P1 to 
P4) to be scanned and evaluated by the evaluation device 

(33) an electronic window is set. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised by
 a changeover device for changing over 
between follow-up and fixed measurement.
