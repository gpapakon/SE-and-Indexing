 GENE THERAPY FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMENBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR ACTIVITY (tFTR)INTRODUCTION Technical FieldThe present invention relates to methods and compositions for producing a transgenic mammal which comprises exogenously supplied nucleic acid coding for a 10 molecule having cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity. The nucleic acid is supplied by aerosolized delivery, particularly to the airways and alveoli of the lung, or by systemic delivery.Background15 Many genetic diseases are caused by the absence or mutation of the appropriate protein, for example as a result of deletions within the corresponding gene. One of the most common fatal genetic diseases in humans is cystic fibrosis (CF). Cystic fibrosis (CF), a spectrum of exocrine tissue dysfunction, which eventually leads to respiratory failure and death results from a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrance conductance20 regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene has now been localized to chromosome 7q31, and cloned. A 3 bp deletion, resulting in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508, is present in approximately 70% of CF chromosomes, but is not seen on normal chromosomes. The other 30% of CF mutations are heterogenous and include deletion, missense, and splice-site mutations. Transfection of even a single normal copy of25 the CFTR gene abolishes the CF secretory defect in CF cell lines, an observation which supports the feasibility of gene therapy for CF. These results demonstrate that expression of a wild-type CFTR transgene can exert a dominant positive effect in CF cells which concurrently express an endogenous mutant CFTR gene. Thus, expression of the wild-type CFTR transgene in the lungs of CF patients can correct the CF phenotype. However, to30 date, the inability to produce hign level expression of transgenes in the lung by either•\ aerosol or intravenous (iv) administration has precluded the use of gene therapy for the treatment of CF. Expression of a wild-type CFTR transgene in cells from CF patients corrects the chloride secretory defect, the primary biochemical lesion of CF. Chloride secretion is normalized in cells of CF patients despite the presence of the mutant CFTR 

 protein, indicating that when wild-type and mutant CFTR proteins are coexpressed in cells, the wild-type CFTR is dominant.To date, attempts to replace absent or mutated genes in human patients have relied on ex vivo techniques. Ex vivo techniques include, but are not limited to, transformation of cells in vitro
