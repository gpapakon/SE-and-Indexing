<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cooling apparatus for plastic profiles, with a tank for receiving a cooling medium, through which the profile (7) can be guided, and with at least one inflow opening (12) and with at least one outflow opening (13) for cooling water. A vacuum can be generated in a simple manner by an arrangement for generating a negative pressure being provided in the tank, which is designed as a self-priming water pump (14), the suction stub of which is connected to the outflow opening (13) for cooling water.
