<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a parallel
synthesis of camptothecin and camptothecin analogs via
novel intermediates at high yields.Camptothecin (Chem. Abstracts Registry
No. 7689-03-4) is a naturally occurring compound found
in Camptotheca acuminata (Nyssaceae) which has
antileukemic and antitumor properties. Numerous
camptothecin analogs having like properties are known,
examples being those described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,894,456 to Wall et al. and European Patent
Application No. 0 325 247 of Yaegashi et al.A number of syntheses for camptothecin are
known. Several routes are reviewed in Natural Products
Chemistry, Vol. 2, 358-361 (K. Nakanishi, T. Goto,
S. Itô, S. Natori and S. Nozoe eds.) and in J. Cai and
C. Hutchinson, Camptothecin, in The Alkaloids, 
Vol. XXI, 101-137 (Academic Press 1983). The biosynthesis
of camptothecin is described in Natural Products Chemistry,
Vol. 3, 573-574 (K. Nakanishi et al. Eds.). A recent
synthetic route is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,894,456
to Wall et al. (see also references cited therein).A problem with prior methods of synthesizing
camptothecin is that they are largely linear syntheses.
Such syntheses provided low yields of the final product
because of the sequential loss in product during each step
of the total synthesis. Parallel synthesis (i.e., a
strategy in which two synthetic paths are followed
separately and the products thereof combined to form the
final product) provide higher yields, but few such
syntheses have been available for campthothecin.One such method of parallel synthesis for camptothecin
is described in PCT Application No. WO92/11263 (filed 18th
December 1991, published 9 July 1992).Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a parallel synthetic method for making camptothecin
and analogs thereof.The present invention provides a process for making a
compound of the formula

wherein R is C1-C8 alkyl, and Y is H, F or Cl,
comprising the steps of:
   cyclizing a compound of the formula
 
wherein R6 is C1-C8 alkyl, R7 is C1-C8 alkyl, R is C1-C8 alkyl
and Y is H, F or Cl with a halotrialkylsilane in the
presence of an aryl or alkyl amine to form an intermediate,
then hydrolizing the intermediate in aqueous acid.The present invention also provides a process for
making compounds of Formulae XIV, XV, and XVII below:

wherein R6 is C1-C8 alkyl, R7 is C1-C8 alkyl, R is C1-C8 alkyl,
Y is H, F or Cl, R8 is a compound of Formula XVIII 

wherein n is 1, 2, or 3, R11 is C1-C4 alkyl and R12 is the
same as R11, or R11 and R12 together form
