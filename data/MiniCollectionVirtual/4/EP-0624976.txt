<ABSTRACT>
The circuit ensures a simple and inexpensive configuration even for use in different transmission standards. For this purpose, the circuit according to the invention is equipped with an oscillation generating stage (4) which derives from a television signal (television IF signal) modulated on a first intermediate-frequency carrier oscillation, a (first) oscillation, the frequency of which corresponds to that of an intermediate-frequency picture carrier oscillation contained in the television IF signal and which encloses a phase angle of at least almost 90@, with a picture carrier oscillation, a (first) mixing stage (17) which can be supplied with the (first) oscillation at a first input, a switch-over device (7) for optionally supplying the television IF signal or an audio signal (audio IF signal) modulated onto a second intermediate-frequency carrier oscillation, to a second input of the (first) mixing stage.

<CLAIMS>
A circuit arrangement for demodulating the sound signals in a television
signal, comprising


an oscillation-generating stage which derives a first oscillation from a television
signal (IF television signal) modulated on a first intermediate-frequency carrier

oscillation, whose frequency corresponds to the frequency of an intermediate-frequency
picture carrier oscillation in the IF television signal and encloses a

phase angle of at least substantially 90Â° with the picture carrier oscillation,
a first mixer stage, a first input of which can receive the first oscillation,
a switching device for optionally applying the IF television signal or a sound
signal (IF sound signal) modulated on a second intermediate-frequency carrier

oscillation to a second input of the first mixer stage.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that for at
least a first transmission standard of the television signal, the IF television signal can be

applied by the switching device to the second input of the first mixer stage, and for at
least a second transmission standard of the television signal, the IF sound signal can be

applied by the switching device to the second input of the first mixer stage.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized by a
control stage by which a switching signal for activating the switching device can be

derived when a predeterminable signal level of the IF sound signal is reached.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the
control stage comprises a comparator for detecting the instant when the predeterminable

signal level is reached.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the
IF sound signal is applied 
via
 two terminals and in that one of the terminals is
impressed with a fixed reference level for reaching the predeterminable signal level

between the two terminals.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the oscillation-generating stage derives a second oscillation from 

the IF television signal, whose frequency and phase correspond to those of the picture
carrier oscillation and which is applied to a first input of a second mixer stage whose

second input can receive the IF television signal for demodulation.
