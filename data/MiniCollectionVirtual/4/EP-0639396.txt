<ABSTRACT>
A merry-go-round (1) having at least one gondola (4, 4') which accommodates passengers is specified, which gondola is connected to a supporting arm (6) for the execution of an orbiting movement around an essentially horizontal axis (7). In addition to this the gondola (4, 4') executes a controllable rotational movement about its own axis (8). For this purpose, the gondola (4, 4') can be mounted on the supporting arm (6) in a manner such that it can rotate about an essentially horizontal axis (8). For this additional rotational movement a separate gondola driving device (11) is preferably provided, and for the rotational mounting of the gondola (4, 4') a gear ring (10) is expediently used. Alternatively, the additional rotational movement of the gondola (4') about its axis can be produced with the aid of a counterweight (12) on the gondola (4').

Merry-go-round having a gondola (4, 4') taking at 
least one person and which is connected to a support arm 

(6) to execute a circulatory movement about an 
essentially horizontal axis (7), in which the gondola (4, 

4') on the support arm (6) is arranged about a rotary 
mounting arranged approximately in the centre of the 

longitudinal extension of the gondola (4, 4'), and by 
means of a gondola drive device (11) executes a separate 

and additional self-motivated rotary movement, which can 
be controlled independently of the circulatory movement 

of the support arm (6), about an essentially horizontal 
axis (8). 
Merry-go-round according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a gear ring (10) for rotary mounting of the gond
ola 
(4, 4') about its own axis (8) is provided for steering 

during the additional rotary movement of the gondola (4, 
4') and to stop the same. 
Merry-go-round according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the gear ring (10) cooperates with a drive device 

(11). 
Merry-go-round according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the drive device (11) can be operated pneumatically, 

hydraulically, electrically or as a combination thereof. 
Merry-go-round according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the drive device (11) comprises a hydraulic pump and 

a gearing. 
Merry-go-round according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the additional rotary 

movement of the gondola (4, 4') about its own axis (8) 
can be controlled automatically.  

 
Merry-go-round according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it comprises a lifting and 

lowering device (3) for lifting the gondola (4, 4') from 
the boarding position (in region 2) and to lower it into 

the same. 
Merry-go-round according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the lifting and lowering device (3) moves the 

gondola (4, 4') hydraulically essentially in the vertical 
direction by means of a spindle drive. 
Merry-go-round according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the gondola (4') has a 

counterweight (12) to execute the additional rotary 
movement about its own axis (8).
