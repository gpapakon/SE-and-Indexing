<ABSTRACT>
A method for verifying that an assay methodology is properly performed that assay reagents employed possess the necessary potency for accurately performing such assay methodology, and whether or not test samples or assay reagents have been tampered with or are adulterated, is described. The method is performed by employing an assay verification sample, comprising a positive analyte component and the test sample under analysis, wherein the assay verification sample is analyzed employing the same assay reagents and essentially the same assay methodology employed to analyze the test sample. The method is particularly useful for performing heterogeneous immunoassays on an automated continuous and random access analytical system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of providing 
assay verification controls in an automated, continuous and 
random access 
analytical system for determining the presence or amount 
of an analyte in a test sample. Generally, analysis of a test sample involves the 
reaction of test samples with one or more reagents with 
respect to one or more analytes wherein it is frequently 
desired that the analysis be performed on a selective basis 
with respect to each test sample. Typically, such analysis 
involves forming a reaction mixture comprising the test 
sample and one or more assay reagents, and the reaction 
mixture is then analyzed by an apparatus for one or more 
characteristics of the test sample. In order to meet the 
growing demands of the modem clinical laboratory to provide 
consistently reliable and accurate results, various devices and 
automated apparatus for performing such analysis have been 
provided. For example, automated clinical analyzers are presently 
avallable for automatically performing such analysis of a test 
sample. Such analyzers typically include a transport or 
conveyor system designed to transport containers of sample 
liquids between various operating stations. For example, a 
reaction tube or cuvette containing a test sample may pass 
through a reagent filling station, mixing station, reaction  
 
forming station, detection stations, analysis stations, and the 
like. In particular, various automated immunoassay analyzers 
have been provided such as the Abbott IMx® analyzer and the 
Abbott TDx® analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, 
Illinois, USA) which utilize procedures involving a variety of 
different assay steps which rely on detection and 
measurement of optical changes in a reaction mixture during 
the assay process. Random access analyzers have also been 
described which not only can analyze multiple test samples, 
but multiple analytes may be analyzed from each test sample. 
In addition, presently available sequential and random access 
analyzers include various reagents within the apparatus itself 
or placed near the apparatus for pipetting purposes. Liquid 
reagents, in bulk form, are selected for the various types of 
tests which are to be performed on the test sample, and are 
stored in or near the apparatus. The reagent delivery units, 
such as pumps and the like, along with valves, control and 
pipette mechanisms, are included in these automated 
analyzers so that different reagents can be mixed according to 
the type of test to be performed.
