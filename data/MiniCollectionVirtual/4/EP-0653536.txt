<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hinge assembly, in particular but
not exclusively a lift-off hinge assembly for a vehicle. Document EP-A-420 685 discloses
a lift-off hinge assembly comprising a first hinge leaf hingedly
connected to a second hinge leaf for relatively angular motion about a
hinge axis, the first hinge leaf having a hinge pin fixedly mounted thereon
and the second hinge leaf having a journal bearing in which the hinge pin
is received for rotation about said axis, the hinge pin being axially slidably
received in the journal to enable axial separation of the first and second
hinge leafs, removable stop means mounted on the hinge pin to prevent
said axial separation.The invention envisages the indication of a simple
means easy to mount and serving for holding
the hinge releasably open, for example when
mounted to a car and a car door. The invention is defined in claim 1 and
the dependent claims 2-16. Various aspect of the present invention are hereinafter described
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :-
Figure 1 is a plan view of an embodiment not covered by claim 1,Figure 2 is a side view of the embodiment shown in Figure 1 when
viewed in the direction of arrow II,Figure 3 is a side view of the embodiment shown in Figure 1 when
viewed in the direction of arrow III, andFigure 4 is an enlarged perspective view of a spring clip used in the
embodiment of Figure 1;Figure 5 is a front view of a hinge according to an
embodiment of the invention;Figure 6 is a side view of a hinge of Figure 5;Figure 7 is an enlarged view of a portion of Figure 6 showing the
stop means;Figure 8 is a plan view from below of the portion shown in
Figure 7; Figure 9 is a plan view from above showing the movement of the
hinge leaf.Figure 10 is a plan view from below similar to Figure 8 of a second
embodiment according to the present invention;Figure 11 is a side view of the embodiment shown in Figure 10.Referring initially to Figures 1-3, there is shown a vehicle door lift-off
hinge assembly 10 comprising a door hinge leaf 11 pivotally connected
to a body hinge leaf 12. The door hinge leaf 11 is intended to be mounted
on the vehicle door (not shown) and the body hinge leaf 12 is intended to
be mounted on the vehicle body (not shown).Hinge leaf 11 is preferably a metal pressing which is formed so as
to have a planar main body portion 14 for attachment to the vehicle door,
the body portion 14 including an upper arm 16 and lower arm 18
projecting laterally therefrom. In use the outer face of the main

<CLAIMS>
A lift-off hinge assembly comprising a first hinge leaf (11) hingedly
connected to a second hinge leaf (12) for relative angular motion about a

hinge axis, the first hinge leaf having a hinge pin (31) fixedly mounted
thereon and the second hinge leaf having a journal bearing in which the

hinge pin is received for rotation about said axis, the hinge pin being
axially slidably received in the journal to enable axial separation of the

first and second hinge leafs, and removable stop means (60) in the form
of a removable clip mounted on the hinge pin to prevent said axial

separation, characterised in that the second hinge leaf (12) includes a cam
formation (150) co-axially arranged with the hinge axis and having a cam

face (151) directed radially outwardly from said axis, the clip being
formed from a strip of resilient material cranked so as to define an

anchorage portion (124) which extends generally radially of the hinge pin
and a cam follower portion (128) which extends generally parallel to the

axis of the hinge pin (31), the cam follower portion being biased in a
radially inward direction into contact with said cam face (151), the cam

face and cam follower portion co-operating to releasably retain the first
and second hinge leafs at a predetermined angular position about said

hinge axis.
A hinge assembly according to Claim 1 wherein said hinge pin (31)
includes a groove (126) and the anchorage portion (124) includes an

aperture (125) through which said hinge pin (31) passes to enable the
anchorage portion to seat in said groove (126) and thereby be connected

to the hinge pin (31), the aperture (125) being located at a distance from
the cam follower portion (128) to cause the aperture wall (125a) to

resiliently contact the hinge pin (31) and the cam follower portion (128)
to resiliently contact said cam face (151). 
A hinge assembly according to Claim 2 wherein the aperture (125)
has a diameter greater than the diameter of said hinge pin (31).
A hinge assembly according to Claim 2 wherein the aperture (125)
has a diameter slightly less than the diameter of said hinge pin (31).
A hinge assembly according to Claim 2 wherein the cam follower
portion (128) includes a projection (130) which co-operates with a recess

(131) formed in said cam face (151) to releasably retain the first and
second hinge leafs at said predetermined angular position.
A hinge assembly according to Claim 2 wherein the cam face (151)

includes a flat (231) having a width substantially equal to the width of the
cam follower portion (128), said flat (231) and cam follower portion (128)

co-operating to releasably retain the first and second hinge leafs at said
predetermined angular position.
A hinge assembly according to any preceding claim wherein said
first hinge leaf (11) is pivotally connected to said second hinge leaf (12)

by first and second axially aligned pivotal connections, the first and
second pivotal connections being axially spaced from one another, a first

stop means (35) located adjacent to the first pivotal connection and a
second stop means (36) located adjacent to the second pivotal connection,

the first and second stop means being arranged to simultaneously limit
pivotal displacement between the first and second hinge leafs at a fully

open position.
A hinge assembly according to claim 1 wherein the first and second
hinge leafs are each in the form of metal pressings, each leaf including a

main body portion (14,20) from which a pair of arms (16,18;21,22) 
laterally project, a first adjacent pair of arms (16,18) of the respective

leafs being connected by said first pivotal connection and a second
adjacent pair of arms (18,22) of the respective leafs being connected by

said second pivotal connection.
A hinge assembly according to claim 8 wherein the first stop means
(35) is defined by an abutment (38) formed on an arm of the first hinge

leaf and a co-operating abutment (40) formed on the body portion of the
second hinge leaf.
A hinge assembly according to claim 9 wherein the abutment (38)
formed on said arm of the first hinge leaf is defined by a shoulder (39).
A hinge assembly according to claim 9 or 10 wherein the co-operating
abutment formed on said main body portion of the second hinge

leaf (12) is defined by a side wall (42) of said main portion body (14).
A hinge assembly according to any of claims 8 to 11 wherein the
second stop means is defined by an abutment (47) formed on an arm of

the second hinge leaf and a co-operating abutment (49) is formed on the
main body portion of the first hinge leaf.
A hinge assembly according to claim 12 wherein the abutment
formed on the arm of the second hinge leaf is defined by an abutment face

formed on an extension (48) of said arm (18).
A hinge assembly according to claim 12 or 13 wherein the co-operating
abutment formed on said body of the first hinge leaf is defined

by an inner side face (49) of said main body portion. 
A hinge assembly according to any of claims 8 to 14 wherein the
gauge of metal for forming both hinge leafs is between 2.5 to 5.5 mm.
A hinge assembly according to claim 15 wherein the gauge of metal
