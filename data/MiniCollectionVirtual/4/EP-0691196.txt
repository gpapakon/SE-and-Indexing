<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infusion tube made 
of flexible material for medical applications, for example 
for infusing liquids such as blood plasma and the like. Infusion tubes for the above mentioned use are already 
widespread in the medical field. They are usually made of 
PVC (polyvinyl chloride), the elasticity characteristics 
whereof are sufficient to allow the application of 
throttling devices capable of adjusting the flow of liquid 
by varying the cross-section of the tube, and to allow the 
connection of needles, plasma bags, cannulae, and the like. The tubes must furthermore have particular mechanical 
requirements to avoid the formation of elbow-shaped crimps 
when the radius of curvature drops below a limit value. However, researches have shown that PVC tends to 
release toxic substances into the liquid that comes into 
contact therewith; despite being harmless for the human 
body in the infinitesimal doses in which they are released, 
there is a tendency to eliminate these substances to avoid 
accumulation effects in the body. In theory, it could be conceivable to use tubes made 
of fully non-toxic materials, but unfortunately tubes made 
of these materials do not have the characteristics required 
to allow their application, or have excessively high 
material and/or transformation costs. A principal aim of the present invention is therefore 
to provide a tube that is adapted to obviate the 
shortcomings of known tubes, that is to say, is non-toxic  
 
and flexible enough according to the requirements of use in 
the medical field. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a flexible tube that can be 
manufactured with easily available materials having 
adequate costs and with conventional methods, so as to 
combine high performance linked to the specific use with 
economical advantages for the users. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a tube adapted to withstand bacteriological sterilization 
processes without being damaged. This aim and these objects are achieved by an infusion 
tube made of flexible material for medical applications, 
characterized in that it comprises an inner layer of 
polypropylene externally covered with a concentric layer of 
a material having flexibility properties and adhesion 
compatibility with said inner layer of polypropylene. Further characteristics and advantages of the 
invention will become apparent from the accompanying 
drawing, which shows, by way of non-limitative example, a

<CLAIMS>
Infusion tube made of flexible material for medical 
applications, characterized in that it comprises an inner 

layer (2) of polypropylene externally covered with a 
concentric layer (3) of a material having flexibility 

properties and adhesion compatibility with said inner layer 
of polypropylene. 
Infusion tube according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said concentric layer (3) is constituted by a 

thermoplastic compound based on styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene 
saturated block polymers, known under the acronym 

S-EB-S. 
Infusion tube according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said concentric layer (3) is constituted by an 

elastomeric thermoplastic compound. 
Infusion tube according to one of claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that said concentric layer (3) of S-EB-S 

is externally covered with an additional layer (4) of 
polypropylene. 
Infusion tube according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said inner and outer 

additional layers of polypropylene (2, 4) have a thickness 
to the order of 0.1 mm. 
Infusion tube according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the concentric layer (3) that is comprised between 

said layers (2, 4) of propylene has a thickness of 
approximately 0.5 mm.
