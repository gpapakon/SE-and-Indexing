<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multi-purpose vehicle with an internal combustion engine (11) and at least one implement (6) which is driven by the said internal combustion engine (11). In order to be able to re-equip the vehicle easily, the internal combustion engine (11) and the implement (6) form individual components which are mounted in a system chassis (2) of the multi-purpose vehicle (1) in a replaceable way.

<CLAIMS>
Multi-purpose vehicle with an implement operated by a
drive unit, which implement is exchangeably located on a

platform-like system frame (2) of the multi-purpose vehicle (1),
characterised in that an internal combustion engine (11) is

provided as the drive unit, which engine is carried along on the
system frame (2), the internal combustion engine (11) and the

implement (6) forming components of separate construction, which
are securely inserted and exchangeably mounted in a grid of the

system frame (2), the grid on the system frame (2) being
constructed in the form of recesses.
Multi-purpose vehicle according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the implement (6) is a cable winch (5).
Multi-purpose vehicle according to Claim 2, characterised
in that a traction cable (17) driven by the cable winch (5) is

guided centrally on the system frame (2) parallel to the
longitudinal axis of the vehicle.
Multi-purpose vehicle according to Claim 3, characterised
in that provided on the rear narrow side of the system frame (2)

is a centrally located guide device (18), through which the
traction cable (17) is guided.
Multi-purpose vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that preferably two downwardly tiltable earth

spades (8) are located in the region of the rear narrow side.
Multi-purpose vehicle according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the earth spades (8) are able to tilt downwards about a

common axis of rotation (23) preferably through approximately
60Â° with respect to the horizontal.
Multi-purpose vehicle according to Claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that the earth spades (8) have a V-shaped 

construction and above a kink (25) in the region adjacent to the
axis of rotation (23) are bent further apart than in the region

facing the earth.
Multi-purpose vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that one or more further implements (6) are

exchangeably mounted on the system frame (2), for example a
generator, a loading crane (7), a hydraulic pump (9), a hose

reel with a hydraulic hose, a water pump and a tool container
(10, 21, 22).
Multi-purpose vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that two props (19) can be extended on the left

and right of the system frame (2).
