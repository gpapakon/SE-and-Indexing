<ABSTRACT>
A programmable memory controller (10) and method for 
configuring the memory controller (10) provide a way to program or 

configure the memory controller (10) for varying types, speeds, and 
sizes of memory devices without physically changing the hardware 

of the memory controller (10). The memory controller can also be 
programmed or configured to select bus control, timing, and 

address signals of the memory controller (10) for accessing 
memory devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to memory controllers and 
methods for configuring said memory controllers and, in particular, 
to a programmable memory controller and a method which programs 
or configures a memory controller. Memory controllers control a variety of functions including 
how data is written to and read from memory, where memory is 
located in the address space, and when certain operations occur 
such as a refresh operation, for example. Memory controllers are 
conventionally one of two types. The first type of conventional 
memory controllers comprises those which are designed for a 
particular memory size, type, and speed and which have 
unchangeable bus control, timing, and address signals. These 
conventional memory controllers are not configurable for different 
sizes, types, or speeds of memory devices but must be used with a 
particular type of memory device. The second type of memory controllers comprises those 
which have limited configurability for varying memory size or 
address location through setting a number of external on/off 
switches. However, these conventional memory controllers are not 
configurable for different types and speeds of memory devices, and 
they cannot change control and timing signals. Therefore, there exists a significant need to be able to 
program through software and configure a memory controller to 
function with different sizes, types, and speeds of memory devices 
as well as be able to change or alter control, timing, and address 
signals of the memory controller. The present invention has utility in programming and 
configuring a memory controller so that it operates with different  
 
memory sizes, different types of memory, and different speeds of 
memory access. Moreover, the memory controller can change any of 
the control, timing, and address signals which are used when 
accessing (reading or writing) memory. Thus, it is an advantage of the present invention to configure 
the size, speed of access, and type of memory devices controlled by 
a memory controller without modifying the hardware. Yet another advantage of the present invention is to alter or 
change bus control, timing, and address signals generated by a 
memory controller without physically modifying the memory 
controller. It is another advantage of the present invention to program a 
memory controller through software so that it operates with 
different memory sizes, different memory types and varying 
memory speeds. Another advantage of the present invention is the ability to
