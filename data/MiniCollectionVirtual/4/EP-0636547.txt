<ABSTRACT>
A stackable front-opening box includes a front portion (4) of lid (3) 
hinged thereto and suitable to retain in the closed position the front panel 

(2) hinged at the bottom, whose height is sufficiently lower than that of the 
other base panels so as to allow the lifting of said front portion (4) until 

opening of the front panel (2) is possible with no need to move the 
overlying box in the stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns boxes, and in particular a box 
provided with a front opening so that it can be stacked without problems in 
putting in and taking out the content thereof. As it is known, numberless kinds of boxes exist for containing the 
most different objects. In particular, reference will be made to a box of the 
kind used to contain garments so as to make up for the lack of drawers 
and/or shelves, typically inside a closet. The typical example of this kind of box is that of a box provided with a 
front window which allows to see the content thereof, as well as with a 
closing lid which may be integral to the box base or separate therefrom. 
The presence of the window allows to find the desired garment with no 
need to open the boxes one after the other until the right one is found. However, these boxes are usually stacked due to room problems, so 
that once the right box has been found it is necessary to pull it out from the 
stack in order to open it and pick the desired garment. It is apparent that 
this is a serious drawback, particularly when the content of the overlying 
boxes is rather heavy. Moreover, if you want to maintain always the same 
order of the boxes to avoid wasting time at every search, it is also 
necessary to put the box back in its position under the others with a 
difficulty even greater than in pulling it out. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a 
stackable front-opening box which overcomes the above-mentioned 
drawbacks. This object is achieved by means of a box having the characteristics 
cited in claim 1. The advantage of the box according to the present invention is that it 
allows to reach its content with no need to move the overlying boxes or to 
pull it out from the stack. This and other advantages and characteristics of the box according 
to the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed 
description of a preferred embodiment thereof, reported as a non-limiting 
example, referring to the annexed drawings wherein: 
Fig.1 is a perspective view of a stack of three boxes of the present 
kind; and  Fig.2 is a perspective view of a second embodiment of a box 
according to the present invention. Referring to fig. 1, there is seen that a box 1 according to the present 
invention has a traditional substantially parallelepipedal shape, but in the 
front portion of the base it has a lowering obtained through a cut along an 
a angle of about 45Â°, performed orthogonally to the box longitudinal axis at 
a distance A
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Stackable front-opening box consisting of a lid (3) and a base 
including a front panel (2) hinged to said base along one of its sides and 

possibly divided in two portions (2', 2'') hinged together, 
said lid (3) including a front portion (4) hinged thereto and suitable to 

retain in the closed position said front panel (2), 
characterized in that the height of said front panel is 

sufficiently lower than that of the other base panels so as to allow the 
lifting of said front portion (4) until opening of the front panel (2) is possible 

with no need to move the overlying box in the stack. 
A box according to claim 1, characterized in that the upper 
portion (2') of the front panel (2) is hinged at the bottom to the lower 

portion (2'') which is provided with means suitable to restrain it to the side 
panels (6) of the base so as to keep it still when the upper portion (2') falls 

forward to open the box. 
A box according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it is 
formed by members hinged together, so that the box can be flattened for 

transport, and provided with devices for their mutual restraint, preferably 
press-studs (13), to assemble the box for use.
