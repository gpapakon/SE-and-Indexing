<ABSTRACT>
A digital filter chip is to be specified by means of which a number of filter functions can be optionally implemented. The filter chip has a number of digital branch filters (F1, F2) which are preceeded by a digital input network (EN) and which are followed by a digital output network (AN), the input network (EN) acting on one or more input signals (x1, x2) in such a manner that the branch filters (F1, F2) and the subsequent output network (AN) generate from these output signals (y1, y2) which correspond to one of a number of possible filter functions. From the signals (u1, u2) supplied by the input network (EN), the branch filters (F1, F2) generate independently of one another the input signals for the output network (AN). The signal processing function of the input network (EN) and of the output network (AN) can be varied depending on the filter function to be implemented.
