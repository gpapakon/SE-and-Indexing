<ABSTRACT>
A propeller in particular for a ship has blades (2) each of which is pivotally arranged in the hub (4) of the propeller so that the blade (2) is capable of pivoting to and fro in an axial plane between forward and rearward positions ( gamma ,  alpha ). The blades (2) are constructed such that each of the blade profiles (3 alpha ,  beta and  gamma ), formed as the intersecting face between a cylinder face coaxial with a propeller and a blade, is symmetrical in a position between forward and rearward positions ( gamma ,  alpha ) which are determined by fixed stops in the hub and/or the simultaneous actions of the centrifugal force and the hydrodynamic pressure on the blade at a predetermined speed of rotation. This imparts a high efficiency and a quiet and steady operation to the propeller, also when the ship navigates rearwardly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a propeller in particular for a 
ship and having blades each of which is pivotally arranged 
in the hub of the propeller so that the blade is capable 
of pivoting to and fro in an axial plane between forward 
and rearward positions. The energy which a propeller is capable of releasing when 
it is to propel a ship forwardly in the water depends upon 
the configuration of the propeller, in particular diameter, 
area, pitch and number of blades, in addition to 
the relative velocity of flow of the water and the actual 
number of revolutions of the propeller. The ratio of the 
energy released to the energy received by the propeller 
from the drive engine is called the efficiency of the propeller 
below, which is thus an expression of the ability 
of the propeller to utilize the added energy. When the 
ship is propelled by power the fuel consumption should be 
restricted to what is strictly necessary for economic and 
environmental reasons. Therefore, it will usually be attempted 
to design a propeller for a specific purpose such 
that it has an efficiency as high as possible under the 
given conditions of operation. One of the most important 
parameters included in the calculations in this context is 
the shape of the blade profiles formed as intersecting 
faces between the blades and cylinder faces which extend 
coaxially with the propeller. It is known that the intended 
good efficiency can be obtained by providing these 
blade profiles with a curved central line between their 
edges and having the convex side of this line facing the 
same way as the direction of navigation.  
 The typical direction of navigation will usually be 
forward, which is therefore generally chosen as the way 
which the convex side of the profile central lines is to 
face. Forward navigation can therefore take place with a 
good efficiency, which, on the other hand, is immediately 
transformed to an extremely poor efficiency when the ship 
is to be propelled rearwardly, because the curvature of 
the profile then faces the wrong way. In propellers having 
rigid blades the curvature and its direction are given 
once and for all when the propeller was manufactured, 
while the curvatures in propellers having pivotable blades 
are changed in response to the position of these. US patent specification 3 981 613 discloses a folding 
propeller which is constructed particularly for improving 
the efficiency during rearward navigation. However, this 
is achieved merely by permitting the blades to pivot to 
positions

the innermost and outermost end parts of the blade, 
each of the blade profiles, formed as the intersecting 

face between a cylinder face (1) coaxial with the propeller 
and a blade, is substantially symmetrical about a straight 

line extending between the edges of the profile in a 
position between forward and rearward positions which are 

determined by fixed stops (11) in the hub (4) and/or the simultaneous 
action of the centrifugal force and the hydrodynamic

by the simultaneous actions of the centrifugal
