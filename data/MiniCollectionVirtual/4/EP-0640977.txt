<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory device, and, more particularly, to a dynamic
random access memory wherein each memory cell comprises
one transistor and one capacitor, and data can be
randomly read/written.In the recent computer controlled data processing
field, types and amounts of data to be processed are
increasing. An important problem is indicated by the
strong demand which has arisen for high speed accessing
for the data read/write operation. Meanwhile, the
memory capacity of a dynamic random access memory (to be
referred to as a "dRAM" hereinafter) has been greatly
improved in accordance with developments in the micro-patterning
technique of memory cell patterns. Thus, a
large amount of data can be stored in a single memory
device of one chip. As a result, the demand for high
speed data accessing of dRAM has increased in strength.Today, in order to improve the data access speed of
dRAM, a large number of data access drive methods have
been developed and proposed. For example, a page mode
dRAM has been proposed. According to a dRAM of this
type, unlike a conventional memory wherein row and
column address lines (i.e., word and bit lines) must be
reset and pre-charged every time selection of one cell
is completed, even after a cell is selected, word lines 
connected to the selected cell are not reset but are
continuously activated. In the readout mode of this
dRAM, after a desired cell is selected the word line
connected thereto is left activated. Therefore, when
another desired cell is designated by using only a bit
line from the other cells connected to this word line,
high-speed selection can be achieved. As a result, the
data access speed of the page mode dRAM can be increased
to twice that of a normal mode dRAM.Furthermore, as a method of improving data access
speed, a dRAM can be driven in a nibble mode. Basically,
cell selection is performed so that four cells
(i.e., 4 bits) connected to intersections between two
adjacent word lines and two adjacent bit lines are used
as one unit. During cell designation, the two word
lines are continuously activated. A desired cell is
designated by a shiftregister from the designated four
cells. At this time, since no column address clock
signal is required, the two bit lines need not be
pre-charged in order to designate one desired cell from
four cells. Therefore, the data access speed of the
dRAM can be further improved as compared to the page
mode dRAM.According to the above dRAMs, however, the pre-charge
operation cannot be
