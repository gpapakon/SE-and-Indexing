<ABSTRACT>
A method of terminating pregnancy in mammals is described by a novel application of the common fertility-promoting hormone known as human menopausal gonadotropin. A single injection of this gonadotropic hormone as early as the first day of conception can terminate pregnancy.

 METHODS OF TERMINATING PREGNANCYThis application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/819,830 filed January 13, 1992, now abandoned.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a novel use of the common fertility-promoting hormon hMG (human menopausal gonadotropin) as an agent to terminate the fertile state pregnancy in female mammals. This invention also relates to the use of hMG for terminating pregnancies in humans.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIt is common scientific knowledge that fertility in mammals is the stage of life during which the ovaries and testes produce eggs and sperm, respectively. In the female gender this process involved the periodic development of ovarian follicles which contain the eggs. In the human species, for example, a pair of ovaries possesses an estimated 300,000 egg-bearing primordial follicles at the time of puberty. When an individual reaches sexual maturity, some of these follicles periodically develop and release their eggs (a phenomenon called ovulation). In all mammalian species that have been studied, the processes of follicular development and ovulation are regulated by two important hormones that are rhythmically secreted from the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. The activejhormones are follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These two gonadotropic hormones are secreted by pituitary cells when the pituitary gland itse is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a small peptide hormon that is produced by nerve cells in a portion of the forebrain known as the hypothalamus. Thus, mammalian fertility is controlled by both nervous and 

 hormonal activities (Espey, L.L., and LA. BenHalim, Obstet. Gynecol. Clin. N. Amer. 17:275, 1990)FSH and LH are large glycoprotein molecules that belong to a group of hormones collectively referred to as "gonadotropins" because they stimulate the gonads. When one or more ovarian follicles reaches maturity by the actions of thes hormones, there is a surge in GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus, and this surge promotes a sharp increase in FSH and LH release from the pituitary glan This sudden increase in gonadotropins stimulates the mature ovarian follicles to enter what is called the "ovulatory process". The ovulatory process requires approximately 10 to 40 hours, depending on the species of mammal. At the end of this metabolic process, the mature ovarian follicles rupture and release fertile eggs into the oviduct (Espey, L.L., and LA. BenHalim, Obstet. Gynecol. Clin. N.

I aim:
1. The method of terminating pregnancy in mammals by the injection into the mammalian body of dosages of one or more of the group of fertOity promoting hormones induding hMG, hCG, FSH and LH in amounts that induce ovarian folficular maturation and ovulation during the period from the first day of conception to the end of the first trimester of the normal gestation period for a given spedes of mammal.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein said injection is administered subcutaneously.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein said injection is administered intramuscularly.
4. The method of daim 1 wherein said injection is administered intravenously.
5. The method of daim 1 wherein said dosage comprises substantiaUy equal quantities of FSH and LH.
6. The method of daim 1 wherein the pregnant mammal is a woman.
7. The method of daim 6 wherein the amount of hMG injected in the pregnant woman comprises from 75 to 300 I.U. each of FSH and LH activities for about seven consecutive days.
8. The method of daim 7 wherein the last daily dosage of hMG is foUowed within 24 to 48 hours by injection of an ovulation inducing dosage of hCG in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 I.U. 


 9. The method of daim 1 wherein prostaglandin E in the amount of 75 to
150 1.U./kg of body weight is introduced into the mammalian body substantiaUy concurrently with the last dosage of said fertOity promoting hormones. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 4 June 1993 (04.06.93) original claims 1 , 6-9 amended ; other claims unchanged(2 pages) ]
1. A method of terminating pregnancy in mammal by inducing ovarian folficular maturation and ovulation during the period from the first day of conception to the end of the first trimester of the normal gestation period for the mammal, the method comprising: injecting into the mammal a dosage of fertOity promoting hormone selected from the group consisting of hMG and a combination of FSH and LH.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein said injection is administered subcutaneously.
3. The method of daim 1 wherein said injection is administered intramuscularly.
4. The method of daim 1 wherein said injection is administered intravenously.
5. The method of daim 1 wherein said dosage comprises substantiaUy equal quantities of FSH and LH.
6. The method of daim 1 wherein the mammal is a woman.
7. The method of daim 1 wherein the fertOity promoting hormone is injected for up to seven consecutive days and wherein the fertOity promoting hormone has an FSH activity of from 75 to 300 I.U. and an LH activity of from 75 to 300 I.U.
8. The method of daim 7 further comprising injecting an ovulation inducing dosage of hCG in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 I.U. 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of the fertOity promoting hormone. 



 9. The method of daim 7 further comprising administering to the mammal prostaglandin E in an amount of from 75 to 150 I.U./kg of body weight substantiaUy concurrently with the last injection of said fertOity promoting hormone.
