<ABSTRACT>
A subscriber interface box (2) 
comprises a network section (12) and a subscriber section 

(14). The network section (12) is connected to a network 
cable (4) and the subscriber section (14) is connected to 

subscriber cables (6) and (8) whereby the network and 
subscriber sections (13,14) are electrically connected via a test 

socket (16). The subscriber interface box comprises lever 
members (38,40) having cavities therethrough for 

receiving wires of the cables (4,6,8) such that the wires 
can be rapidly connected and disconnected to insulation 

displacement contacts. The latter is done by placing the 
wires in corresponding holes (
73,74) of the lever members (38) 
when the lever members are in an open position, whereby 

the lever members comprise slots (76,78) transversely 
intersecting the wire receiving cavities. The slots (73,74) are for 

receiving upstanding insulation displacement contacts 
such that when the levers are pushed down to a close 

position the wires are forced into electrical contact 
with the IDC contact slots. Insertion of a test plug into 

the test socket (16) resiliently biases contact arms that 
extend from the subscriber (14) to the network section (12) such 

that there is electrical disconnection therebetween and 
electrical connection of the network section (12) to the 

testing plug.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a subscriber interface box
for electrically connecting a telephone network cable to
subscriber cables, and in particular a subscriber
interface box having a separate network and subscriber
section with a test socket therebetween.It is desirable in the telephone industry, to have
a versatile and flexible wiring connection system between
the network and the subscriber lines. Due to the number
of electrical devices that are now connectable to the
telephone system, for example telefax machine, telephone
and answering machine, there is a need for rapid and easy
connection of these devices to the network. The growing
number of devices and the flexibility demanded by the
subscriber has led the telephone companies to take
responsibility of the public network, and the electrical
devices become the responsibility of the subscriber. The
telephone companies therefore only repair and maintain
the network lines supplied right to the subscriber. If a
fault occurs, one must therefore first be able to
determine whether the fault lies on the network or on the
subscriber side. In order to do this correctly one must
disconnect the subscriber from the network side, because
a short circuit on the subscriber side, for example,
would influence a testing apparatus connected to the
network cable at the subscriber box. There is therefore
a need to provide a subscriber box having a network
section and a subscriber section that can be electrically
disconnected and only the network cables tested for
faults.In order to reduce installation and repair costs,
especially considering the increasing number of devices
to be connected, it is desirable to provide a subscriber
interface box that has means to rapidly connect and
disconnect the subscriber wires and network wires 
together, and in particular without requiring the use for
special tools or skilled personnel.A prior art subscriber interface box is described in
US 4562311 (on which the preamble of claim 1 is based).
The box has a base closable by a cover to which bridging
contacts are mounted. When the cover is slid fully over
the base, the bridging contacts interconnect complementary
pairs of terminals which are respectively connected to a
subscriber wire and a network wire. A test socket in the
box is electrically isolated until the cover is slid
partially off the base at which point the bridging
contacts move so as to disconnect the complementary pairs
of subscriber and network terminals and connect further
network terminals with test socket terminals
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A subscriber interface box (2) for making
electrical connection between a network cable (4) and

subscriber cables (6, 8), the interface box (2) comprising
a base (28), a subscriber section (14), a network section

(12), terminals (120, 130) for electrically connecting the
network section (12) to the subscriber section (14) and a

test socket (16) for receiving a testing apparatus plug
(110) for electrically connecting the testing apparatus to

the network section (12) when the network section (12) is
electrically disconnected from the subscriber section

(14), 
characterised in that
 the terminals (120, 130) are adapted to
electrically connect the network section (12) to the

subscriber section (14) via the test socket (16) and some
of the terminals (120) have a resilient contact portion

(126), the resilient contact portions are adapted to engage
corresponding other terminals to electrically connect the

network section (12) to the subscriber section (14) such
that insertion of the testing apparatus plug (110) into

the test socket (16) resiliently biases the resilient
contact portions (126) to electrically disconnect the

subscriber section (14) from the network section (12) and
electrically connects the testing apparatus to the network

section (12).
The subscriber interface box (2) of claim 1
wherein the test socket (16) comprises a plug receiving

cavity (92) and a disconnection insert cavity (98) that
