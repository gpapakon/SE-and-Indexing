Retaining element (1) having at least one retaining 
region (2, 2', 2") and a bearing region (3) which is 

assigned to said retaining region (2, 2', 2") and has an 
opening (4) passing through it which is provided with 

engagement parts (5) for securing on a fastening part, 
characterized in that the opening (4) passes through the 

bearing region (3) such that the retaining element (1) 
can be fitted onto the fastening part from both end sides 

(6, 7), and in that a number of engagement parts (5) is 
assigned in each case to one direction in which the 

opening (4) of the bearing region (3) is fitted onto the 
fastening part. 
Retaining element according to Claim 1, the 
engagement parts (5) being designed as spring tongues (8) 

which are distributed over the circumference of the 
opening (4), characterized in that some of the spring 

tongues (8) are arranged in each case in the region of 
the two end sides (6, 7) of the opening (4). 
Retaining element according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the spring tongues (8) of the two regions 

are offset with respect to one another, in the longitudinal 
direction. 
Retaining element according to Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that three spring tongues (8) distributed 

ver the circumference are arranged in each case in 
the region of an end side (6, 7) of the opening (4). 
Retaining element according to one of Claims 2 to 
4, characterized in that longitudinal ribs (9) are 

arranged in the opening (4), between the spring tongues  
 

(8), in order to centre the fastening part designed as a 
bolt. 
Retaining element according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the longitudinal ribs (9) are located in 

the central region (10) of the opening (4), in that the 
spring tongues (8) in each case adjoin said longitudinal 

ribs (9) in the end regions (11, 12) of the latter, and 
in that the spring tongues (8) are in each case directed 

towards the longitudinal ribs (9). 
Retaining element according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the opening (4) of the bearing region (3) 

has in each case one push-in zone (13, 14) at the two 
ends, the spring tongues (8) adjoining said push-in zone 

towards the interior of the opening (4). 
Retaining element according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the push-in zones (13, 14) are of a 

conical design in each case. 
Retaining element according to Claims 7 and 8, 
characterized in that the spring tongues (8) each have a 

fastening region (15) which is adjoined by the conical 
push-in zones (13, 14). 
Retaining element according to Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that two bearing regions (3, 3') are 

arranged one beside the other, one bearing region (3) 
having a conical push-in zone (13) at one end and the 

other bearing region (3') having a conical push-in zone 
(14) at the other end. 
Retaining element according to one of the preceding 
claims, having a plurality of retaining regions (2, 

2', 2"), characterized in that the bearing region or the 
bearing regions (3, 3') is or are arranged between the 

retaining regions (2, 2', 2").
