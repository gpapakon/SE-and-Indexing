<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a valve for an eorosol container for dispensing a suspension or solution of a substance in a liquid propellant contained therein. The valve comprises a valve body (1) defining an aperture, a seal (9) mounted at the aperture, and a valve stem (7) having a dispensing passage (15), the valve stem (7) being slideably moveable through the seal (9) such that in a first position the valve is closed to prevent the substance to be dispensed from entering the dispensing passage (15), and in a second position the valve is opened to allow the substance to be dispensed through the dispensing passage (15). The seal (9) is made from a material comprising a fluorine-containing polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aerosol container comprising a valve with the aid of which a
quantity of the contents thereof can be dispensed. The invention has particular
application to the dispensing of metered doses of medicaments, though it is
applicable to the dispensing of aerosols generally.The continuing use of aerosol formulations comprising conventional
chlorofluorocarbon propellants is being debated due to the suspected role of
such propellants in atmospheric depletion of ozone. Accordingly, formulations
based on alternative propellants such as HFA-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane)
and HFA-227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) are being developed to replace
those conventional propellants thought to contribute to atmospheric ozone
depletion.Containers for aerosol formulations commonly comprise a vial body coupled to a
valve. The valve comprises a valve stem through which the formulations is
dispensed. Generally the valve includes a rubber valve seal intended to allow
reciprocal movement of the valve stem while preventing leakage of propellant
from the container.It has been found that some conventional devices for delivering aerosols suffer
impaired performance when used in connection with HFA-134a or HFA-227.
Selection of suitable materials for use in valves to contain aerosol formulations
based on these alternative propellants is complicated by interactions between
the valve component materials and the formulation components, including the
propellant. In conventional devices, particularly with some drug formulations the
valve stem tends to stick, pause, or drag during the actuation cycle with the
result that the user perceives an unsmooth action as the valve stem is
depressed and released. This may be partly caused by the drug to be
dispensed from the container sedimenting or precipitating out of the drug-propellant
suspension or solution formulation and depositing on the internal
valve components, the presence of drug on the sliding interface between valve
stem and seal creating increased friction during operation. International Patent Application WO-A-95/02651 describes an aerosol
valve wherein the rubber valve seal is made of a composition specially selected
to minimise leakage of the propellant through the interface between the valve
seal and valve stem upon firing. Smoothness of operation is also improved with
some formulations compared to devices involving conventional thermoset
rubber seals. However, although such seal compositions may improve valve
performance, they do not prevent build
