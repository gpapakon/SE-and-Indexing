<ABSTRACT>
Reacting the industrially readily available perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (3) with specific primary amines in the presence of water gives perylene-3,4-dicarboxylic bisimides (2). Their hydrolysis affords the perylene-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride on a preparative scale, and this anhydride is reacted with any primary amines to give likewise the corresponding imides 2. Condensation of the anhydride with diamines results in novel types of dyes, namely perylene-3,4-dicarboxamidines which have very good fastness properties. Also claimed are specific perylene-3,4-dicarboxylic diesters, perylene-3,4-dicarboxylic ester- amides, perylene-3,4-dicarboxylic diamides, perylene-3,4-dicarboxamidines and perylene-3,4-dicarbonyl derivatives, processes for preparing these compounds and their use. The compounds according to the invention are suitable, for example, as colorants for the mass coloration of high-molecular-weight organic material, for use in security printing, as fluorescent dyes for machine-readable markings, as laser dyes, and for preparing printing toners, colour filters, organic photoreceptors, electroluminescence and photoluminescence elements or solar collectors and in specific substituted compounds are also suitable for use as rheology improvers.
