<ABSTRACT>
The material 
handling vehicle is capable of operating in a 

manned mode, a wire guidance mode, and a rail 
guidance mode and contains a steering management control 

system having a fuzzy logic steering controller. The steering management 
control system allows the vehicle to adapt itself to different wire 

control systems. That is, particular parameters, frequency 
and amplitude of the underlying wire guidance 

system can be determined. In this manner, the 
manned vehicle is universally adaptiv
e to a wide 
variety of wire guidance systems. 

The steering management control system also 
monitors the weight and height of the vehicle's load and 

receives signals from the steering tiller (19), as well 
as from the guidewire (26) embedded in the floor of the 

material storage facility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to guidewire 
controls for manned material handling vehicles and, 
more particularly, to a universal guidewire fuzzy 
control system for manned material handling 
vehicles that is capable of adapting to and 
learning the different frequencies and amplitudes 
of diverse guidewire systems. Unmanned vehicles have heretofore been guided 
through a warehouse or other storage facility by 
guidewire control systems. Fuzzy logic can also be 
used to control the speed and direction of unmanned 
vehicles, as is illustrated in United States Patent 
No. 5,218,542 (issued to Endo et al on June 8, 
1993). Many manned material handling vehicles which may be 
of a type designed for order picking can be 
alternatively controlled by a wire guidance system.  
 
Such additional control is a valuable operative 
feature. The use of pairs of coils disposed on the vehicle 
centerline, in order to generate an error signal 
indicative of vehicle deviation from the embedded 
or buried wire, is also well known, as illustrated 
in United States Patent No. 4,307,329 (issued to 
Taylor on December 22, 1981). The DE 30 37 221 C1 discloses a manned material 
handling vehicle that is operative in either a 
manual or an automatic wire guidance mode, the 
vehicle comprising means for generating a position 
request signal in either said manual mode or said 
automatic wire guidance mode, a steer unit 
generating a feedback signal, and steering control 
means processing said feedback signal from said 
steer unit along with said position request signal 
generated in either mode of operation and speed, 
which generated command is fed to said steer unit 
to guide said material handling vehicle. The EP 0 138 097 A1 discloses steering control 
means with center frequency adjustment for a wire 
guided vehicle which is able to operate on 
different wire systems.  
 Designing a manned vehicle for wire guidance 
operations continues to pose several problems. 
Each warehouse facility that has installed 
guidewire controls for guided vehicles operates the 
controls at different wire frequencies and 
amplitudes that are designed for its own distinct 
wire-guided system. Any mass-produced (non-customized) 
material handling vehicle must, 
therefore, have the capability of recognizing and 
responding to the different frequencies and 
amplitudes of warehouse wire guidance systems. 
Manned material handling vehicles must have the 
capability of automatically switching to manual 
control when the wire guidance control is 
interr
