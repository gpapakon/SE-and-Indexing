<ABSTRACT>
A printer (A) in which an ink ribbon (10) is not 
wound when a ribbon code 

ring (21) is read, a dedicated motor for rotating 
the ribbon code ring (21) is 

not required, and it is possible to rotate the 
ribbon code ring (21) with 

the same motor used for moving a printing head. 
When an information 

code (23) of an ink ribbon is to be read, a print head is 
held in an initial 

position HO, and a pendulum gear (107), which can be 
rotated only when a cam 

is reversed, is brought into mesh with a ribbon code ring (21) 
which rotates 

irrespective of a supply spool of a ribbon cassette (1). 
The information 

code on the ribbon code ring is detected by a sensor as the code ring 
is rotated. A locking system is provided for preventing accidental 

opening of a ribbon door (420) of the printer 
during printing operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a printer for printing
a recorded image, such as a video image or the like, as a hard copy in
the form of a color photograph, and more particularly to an ink ribbon
code reading mechanism for a color video printer of the sublimational
thermal-transfer type.Previously proposed ribbon code reading mechanisms for an ink
ribbon stored in a ribbon cassette in a color video printer include
three general types of ribbon code reading mechanisms as follows:
(a) A ribbon code reading mechanism in which, while bringing
the head of an ink ribbon from a ribbon cassette into an operative
position, an information mark on a ribbon code ring mounted on the
shaft of an ink ribbon supply spool in the ribbon cassette is detected
by a sensor when the ink ribbon supply spool is rotated while the ink
ribbon is being wound;(b) A ribbon code reading mechanism in which a dedicated motor
is used for reading a ribbon code ring, a pendulum gear is rotated by
energization of the motor, and a ribbon code is read by a sensor; and(c) A ribbon code reading mechanism in which, when a print head
is moved, a ribbon code ring is rotated by a gear held in ganged
relation to the movement of the print head, and a ribbon code is read
by a sensor. A ribbon code reading mechanism of this type is shown
generally in U.S. Patent No. 5,290,114.With the ribbon code reading mechanism (a), the ink ribbon is
required to be as long as the angular displacement of the ribbon code
ring, and if the ribbon code ring is to be rotated to make several
revolutions for increasing the reliability with which the ribbon code
is read, then the ink ribbon is also required to be long commensurately
with such several resolutions to be made by the ribbon code ring.The ribbon code reading mechanism (b) requires a motor dedicated
to rotate the ribbon code ring. Because a space for installing the
motor is needed, it is difficult to reduce the size of the printer, and
the cost of the printer is increased.In the ribbon code reading mechanism (c), when the ribbon code
ring is rotated, since the print head is lowered in ganged relation to
the ribbon code ring, the ink ribbon is loosened or slackened. With 
the ink ribbon loosened, the ink ribbon cannot easily be removed from the printer
paper. A process of removing the slack from the ink ribbon is time-consuming.The present invention has been made to alleviate the above problems of the
conventional ribbon code reading mechanisms and provide a printer in which an ink
ribbon is not wound
