<ABSTRACT>
A self-propelled agricultural harvesting machine (1) is 
provided with a single channel network (300) for serial 

communication of digital data messages between programmable 
microprocessors (215, 218) in a multi-master configuration. The 

messages are encoded according to an advanced serial 
communica
tions protocol and are available to all microprocessors 
(215, 218). The network comprises an optical transmission network 

with an active starpoint (230) and plastic optical fibres (231), 
which link the nodes which lay physically far away from each 

other. An RS232 socket, which is linked to the network (300), 
enables loading of data and programs to the microprocessors (215, 

218). Thus is obtained a reliable and flexible control system for 
the machine settings, which comprise on-road and off-road 

(harvesting) parameters. The introduction of a wide range of 
automatic control routines simplifies to a large extent the tasks 

of the operator during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to self-propelled agricultural
harvesting machines and more particularly to
the process for controlling the settings thereof,
as disclosed in Artmann, R.; Speckmann, H; Robra, J.: "Datenübertragung zwischen Traktor,
Arbeitsgeräten und Betriebs computer"; DE-Journal: Landtechnik 10/89, pages 428-431
(closest prior art document). A process
according to the invention deals with the problems
and drawbacks which are bound to occur when automatic
control is introduced on an increasing number of
machine settings, while no concessions on reliability
and flexibility can be accepted.The high cost of modern harvesting machines,
such as combine harvesters or self-propelled forage
harvesters, urges the owners to employ their machines
in a broader range of crop types, geographical locations
and weather conditions. Manufacturers, on the other
hand, make their machines more versatile through the
addition of new crop processing features and the widening
of the ranges of the known machine settings.
Another trend is the increased machine capacity which
reduces the necessary harvesting time per hectare of
crop.As a result both quantity and frequency of machine
adjustments have increased substantially. For ease of
operation, almost every setting is controlled by the operator
from his driving position on the steering platform.
The original, fully mechanical control has been replaced
by electrical control systems, which may incorporate an
electronic device for automatically changing the
machines settings, thus simplifying the tasks of the
operator.Actual electrical control systems on harvesting
machines require a large number of wires and connections,
because a separate conductor is needed for every
signal from and to the operator's position. Reliability of
such systems is hard to maintain, because chances for
mistakes during manufacturing, such as loose or
switched connections, are great and the physical connections
at the end of the wires are subject to mechanical
vibrations and atmospheric corrosion. Moreover,
long wires are subject to electromagnetic interferences
by radio transmissions and feed unwanted signals to the
operator's platform.If one wants to add a new control device to the harvesting
machine, he will be forced to lead new wires to
the operator's platform. Therefore, actual electrical systems
cannot easily be adapted to modified features,
meaning that their flexibility is limited.The use of a single electronic device, such as a
central microprocessor unit, as shown in US-A-4 527
