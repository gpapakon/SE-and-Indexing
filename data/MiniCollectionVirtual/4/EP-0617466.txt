<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layered package is disclosed that employs 
novel shielding techniques to improve high frequency 

performance of the package. Shield vias (204) are placed near 
conductive vias (200) to create a two-wire transmission line with 

controllable characteristic impedance. Controlled 
transmission line impedance reduces signal reflection due to 

line impedance variations and ground bounce due to inductive 
coupling. Opposite polarity shielding technique is introduced 

in vertical as well as horizontal directions to reduce 
capacitive coupling of noise between signals and provide 

immunity against differential power supply noise. Signal 
layers disposed half way between floating shield planes 

provided immunity against non-common mode noise coupling. For 
integrated circuits with varying types of signals (
e.g
. CMOS 
and TTL and ECL type signals), the package creates 

electrically isolated zones to drastically reduce noise 
coupling between the circuits with different signal types.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to design
and fabrication of packages for semiconductor devices. More
particularly, the present invention relates to multi-layer
type packages with controlled impedances and noise for signal
paths and reduced inductance for power lines in order to
reduce high frequency signal degradation within the package.In the field of semiconductor device manufacture,
it is necessary to provide a connection from an integrated
circuit to the "outside world." This function is typically
performed by a semiconductor package which houses the
integrated circuit (IC) chip and includes a number of leads or
pins for electrical signal and power transmission. In
addition to transferring signals, power, and the like to and
from the outside world, the package serves to protect the
integrated circuit from environmental effects and facilitate
heat dissipation.As the operating frequencies of IC's have increased,
packaging of IC's has become more critical. With increased
switching speed and rate of current change, the transient
voltages and consequently inductive impedance in signal paths
also increases. A signal transmission path through a package
typically includes adjacent pins or leads, and parallel
vertical vias and adjacent horizontal conductive strips in the
case of multi-layer packages or long parallel conductive
traces formed by lead frame fingers in the case of dual in-line
packages. These structures all exhibit substantial
inductance, capacitance and varying impedances that result in
signal degradation.Inductance, particularly in the power and ground
connections, causes waveform degradation, ground bounce and
cross-talk between the various signals. Capacitive coupling
between adjacent signal transmission lines also causes cross-talk 
which is a source of noise. Variations in signal line
impedance cause signal reflections which also cause signal
degradation.The severity of these noise problems is magnified in
an environment where low-voltage-swing signals, such as
emitter coupled logic (ECL) signals, must operate in the
presence of high-voltage-swing signals (e.g. CMOS signals),
especially at higher frequencies. From the stand point of
power consumption, it is desirable to employ low-voltage-swing
signals whenever possible for any signal switching at high
frequency. This is due to the fact that physical dimensions
force the characteristic impedance of a transmission line to
be no higher than about 50 ohms. To eliminate signal
reflection, a 50 ohm transmission lines is terminated by a
