<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention relates to protein molecules in particular hybrid protein
molecules for the prevention of treatment of human beings afflicted with AIDS and
diseases caused by Human Immuno Deficiency Viruses especially types 1 and 2; and
other blood borne pathogens.The AIDS syndrome is widely believed by the majority of Scientists (with a few
exceptions) to be the end result of infection with Human Immuno Deficiency Virus type
1 or 2. Despite available treatment, on diagnosis of AIDS, life expectancy is short and
death occurs usually within two years - death resulting from overwhelming infection
and/or neoplastic diseases provoked by a profound immuno deficiency . The causative
agent of this condition the HIV virus was proposed by Montagnier L and by Barre-Sinoussi
F et al 1983, Science 220, 868-870 and slightly later by Gallo R et al 1983,
Science 220 865-867.The accepted view of most Scientists is that this virus is necessary at least in part for
production of this fatal Immuno Deficiency Syndrome. One notable exception to this
belief is Deusberg P H who champions the minority view that AIDS is not caused by
the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus and that it is not transmissible; Deusberg P H
Proceedings National Acad Sci USA Vol 88, 1575-1579, Feb 1991. Regardless of the
merits of this contradictory opinion and academic debate, work continues to find
methods of combating the HIV virus and removing its presence from infected humans.
Since the discovery of the HIV agent in the early 1980's screening of the worlds
population has demonstrated that the HIV/AIDS pandemic is much worse than
previously imagined. Evidence suggests that the impact of the disease will fall on
disadvantaged women and children living in deprived urban areas or in sub-Saharan
Africa or the Third World. It is estimated that 10 million persons will contract this
condition before the year 2000 Chin J, Lancet 1990; 336: 221-224. Transmission of
this virus to newborns from infected mothers remains a growing problem. At the 
present time in Africa, there are at least 2.5 million infected females who have given
birth to an estimated 0.5 million infected infants. Disadvantaged urban areas in the
developed world such as areas of New York associated with high rates of drug use have
also shown high sero-positivity rates of HIV among neonates ie 2.2% compared with
an overall sero-positivity of 1.25% among neonates in that city. NOVAK, Journal of
America Medical Association 1989; 261: 1745-1750. The social and economic costs
