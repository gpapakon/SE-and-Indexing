<ABSTRACT>
A vaccine for the prevention of disease caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) which comprises FIP viral precursor immunogens derived from in vitro produced cells persistently infected with FIPV. A method of producing FIP viral precursor immunogens is disclosed which comprises culturing in vitro FIP-persistently infected cells in a serum-containing growth medium, subsequently transferring and maintaining said cultured cells in a serum-free medium under conditions for a time adequate to accumulate FIP viral precursor immunogens shed from said cells, and then separating the cells from the supernatant containing the viral precursor immunogens. Any live virus present in the mixture is inactivated and the supernatant containing the FIP viral precursor immunogens is blended with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant in order to form the FIP vaccine disclosed herein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionFeline Infectious Peritonitis Vaccine and Method of PreparationTechnical FieldFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a sporadic disease occurring unpredictably in domestic and wild Felidae. While FIP is primarily a disease of domestic cats, it has been diagnosed in lions, mountain lions, leopards, cheetahs, and the jaguar. Smaller wild cats that have been afflicted with FIP include the lynx and caracal, sand cat, and pallas cat. In domestic cats, the disease occurs predominantly in young animals, although cats of all ages are susceptible. A peak incidence occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. A decline in incidence is noted from 5 to 13 years of age, followed by an increased incidence in cats 14 to 15 years old. There is no significant sex predisposition. FIP occurs more frequently in purebred cats, presumably because these cats are kept more commonly in catteries or multiple cat households. The disease is world-wide in distribution.FIP is caused by a type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped particles that average 100 nm in diameter and contain a single strand of RNA. Characteristic petal-shaped projections called peplomers protrude from the viral surface. In many species of animals, coronaviruses have a relatively restricted organ tropism, infecting the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal systems. Following oral infection, the viruses have an affinity for the mature apical columnar epithelium of the villi in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.The coronaviruses that infect cats have been divided into those that cause FIP (FIPVs) and those that induce subclinical to severe enteritis (the feline enteric coronaviruses, or FECVs) . The FIPVs differ from the FECVs in their ability to escape from the gastrointestinal tract and spread to replication sites in distant tissues. FIPVs and FECVs may represent pathogenetic variants of a single 

coronavirus type. Alternatively, FIPVs may arise periodically as mutants of FECV strains.FIPV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, canine coronavirus (CCV) , and human respiratory tract coronaviruses of the 229E group comprise an antigenic cluster of closely related viruses within the Coronaviridae group. The major structural polypeptides of FIPV, TGEV, and CCV are so similar antigenically that some consider these three viruses as host range mutants rather than individual viral species.The name, feline infectious peritonitis, refers to the principal form of the disease, an inflammatory condition of the visceral serosa and
