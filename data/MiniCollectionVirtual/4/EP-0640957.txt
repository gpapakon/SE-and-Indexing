<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a floating magnetic head device is disclosed. The 
method has the steps of: forming a pedestal (14) on a substrate (13) by positioning and 

adhering plural blocks (11) having plural magnetic head elements (12) loaded thereon 
onto the substrate (13) in such a manner that magnetic gaps of the magnetic head 

elements (12) of the different blocks (11) are linearly arrayed and that the plural blocks 
(11) are in parallel to one another with equal intervals; forming a resist mask (20) having 

a predetermined slider surface shape on the block of the pedestal (14); injecting a 
solid/gaseous two-phase current of free abrasive grains (31) and gas onto a resist mask 

forming surface of the pedestal (14) through an injection nozzle; and slicing the pedestal 
(14) into sliders (1) of predetermined size.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a floating magnetic head 
device used for a hard disk drive unit or a floppy disk drive unit. The floating magnetic head device used for a hard disk drive unit for recording or 
reproducing information into or from a hard disk has a magnetic head element for 
recording and reproducing of information loaded on a slider, and has the slider supported 
by a suspension composed of a blade spring. The slider is mounted on an actuator arm 
rotating in the radial direction of the hard disk. The slider is caused to contact the surface of the hard disk by downward spring 
load applied from the suspension when the hard disk is not rotated. When the hard disk 
is rotated, the slider is caused to float by upward lift due to an air current generated by 
the rotation of the hard disk. As the downward spring load is applied to the slider from 
the suspension, the slider having the magnetic head element loaded thereon floats in 
running with a slider floating distance determined by a balance of the upward lift and the 
downward spring load. The slider rubs the hard disk immediately before actuation and 
termination of operation. In the floating magnetic head device as described above, protrusions and grooves 
are provided on the hard disk facing surface of the slider to shorten the rubbing time with 
the hard disk and to improve durability, and the upward lift applied to the slider is 
adjusted to adjust the slider floating distance. For instance, rail processing is carried out 
on the hard disk facing surface of the slider to form slider rails as substantially 
rectangular protrusions thereon. The hard disk facing surface of the slider rail is used as 
an air bearing surface to receive the air current generated on the hard disk surface. A 
groove called an air groove which the air current enters is provided between the slider 
rails, to adjust the slider floating distance. The projections and groove are formed by 
mechanical processing. However, as a reduction in size of the hard disk drive unit has been recently 
required, a reduction in size of the slider constituting the floating magnetic head device 
is required. Consequently, the above-mentioned mechanical processing of the slider is 
becoming more difficult on the basis of precision. Also, as a higher recording density of the hard disk drive unit has been recently 
required, a lower floating distance and stability of the slider floating distance of the 
floating magnetic head device are required. However, the
