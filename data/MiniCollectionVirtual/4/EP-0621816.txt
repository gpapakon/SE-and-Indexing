<DESCRIPTION>
 LASER TABLET TREATMENT SYSTEM WITH DUAL ACCESS TO TABLETTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to laser drilling for forming drug release ports in pharmaceutical tablets, and more particularly to such drilling in which the tablet may be accessed from either side.BACKGROUND ARTUS 4,063,064 issued on December 13, 1977 to Richard J. Saunders and Wayne S. Mefferd, and US 4,088,864 issued on May 9, 1978 to Felix Theeuwes, Richard J. Saunders and Wayne S. Mefferd, disclose a tablet treating machine with a single rotating wheel for transporting tablets up from a tablet reservoir to a laser treatment station.The wheel is inclined and has a set of slots each of which carries a single tablet. The slots have a bottom surface, two side walls, and a back wall formed on the inclined side of the wheel for cradling the tablet during transport. The laser beam accesses the tablet on the front exposed side for drilling a drug release port therein. The tablets may be drilled on one side only. The backside of each tablet rests against the back wall of the slot and is inaccessible to the laser beam.The energy of the laser pulse in these machines requires about five milliseconds to form the release port in the tablet. A tracking mirror is employed to keep the laser beam trained on the tablet during the laser pulse period. Synchronism between the laser pulse and the sequence of tablets is maintained manually by an operator who monitors the operation of the machine. The shape and size of the laser beam is controlled by laser optics. 

 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides an improved tablet treating system for treating pharmaceutical tablets with a laser beam.This invention further provides such a tablet treating system which treats both sides of the tablets.This invention further provides such a tablet treating system in which the laser beam is stationary and does not track the moving tablet.This invention further provides such a tablet treating system in which the synchronization between the laser operation and the tablet motion is maintained automatically.This invention further provides such a tablet treating system in which the laser operation is adjusted to maintain the laser-tablet synchronization.This invention further provides such a tablet treating system in which tablets are aborted unless synchronization is maintained.Briefly, the present invention provides a tablet treating system for treating pharmaceutical tablets with pulses of laser energy within at least one predetermined treatment site on
