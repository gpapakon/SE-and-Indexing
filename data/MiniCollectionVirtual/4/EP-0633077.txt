<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for the intermittent feed of workpieces, for example in a press (2) or similar production machine or in other processing operations to be carried out in steps, has two feed bars (3) which can be moved backwards and forwards in the feed direction, have gripping parts (3a) or gripping regions for gripping the workpieces (100), to grip the workpieces can be moved towards one another and, to perform an advance in this gripping position, can be moved jointly in the feed direction and then release the workpieces by moving apart and can be displaced back into the starting position by means of a return movement. Engaging on each feed bar (3) are the pivotable ends (5) or end regions of at least two levers (4), which can be pivoted in the plane of motion of the feed bar (3) or a plane parallel thereto, the levers (4) of one feed bar (3) being pivotable in the opposite direction to those of the other feed bar (3), and these levers (4) are each connected up by means of a longitudinal guide (7). It is particularly expedient if each of the pivoting levers (4) engaging on one particular feed bar (3) are connected to one another mechanically, in particular by means of a tie bar (8) and so as to be rotatable relative to the said tie bar and can thus be moved synchronously. This provides an effective drive, particularly for the gripping movement, which can be kept free from backlash in a simple manner and takes up little space.
