<DESCRIPTION>
 PHENYLDERIVATE AS INHIBITORS OF ATP CITRATE LYASEThe present invention relates to certain novel compounds, processes and intermediates used in their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.It is now widely accepted that treatment of even moderate type II hypercholesterolaemia results in a reduction in mortality and morbidity due to coronary heart disease (CHD) . Increased plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) , the hallmark of type II hypercholesterolaemia are due to a variety of genetic and environmental factors resulting in increased LDL synthesis, decreased LDL catabolism or combinations of both. Current therapies for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia are directed towards stimulation of LDL catabolism (bile acid sequestrants and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors) as well as inhibition of LDL synthesis (nicotinic acid and maxepa fish oil) .The present invention relates to a new class of compounds which are expected to be of use in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia and preventing the development of consequent disorders like atherosclerosis and pancreatitis, as well as treatment of metabolic disorders like obesity. The compounds act by inhibition of the enzyme ATP citrate lyase, so inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid synthesis resulting in lowered plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In particular, it is expected that the compounds will be particularly useful in the treatment of mixed hyperlipidaemia (type lib) .The present invention therefore provides, in a first aspect, compounds of structure (I) : 
(I)in which, each group R1 is independently a lipophilic and/or electron withdrawing group; n is 5 to 8; and either R^ and R^ are both hydrogen, R4 is hydrogen or hydroxy and R^ is CH(R6)R7 in which R^ is hydrogen or hydroxy and R7 is a carboxyl group or a carboxylic acid ester group hydrolysable to a carboxyl group; or R4 is hydrogen and R^ is hydrogen or hydroxy, R^ is hydroxy and R^ is a carboxyl group or a carboxylic acid ester group hydrolysable to a carboxyl group; or R^ and R^ are hydrogen and R4 and R^ together form a group =C(R^)R7 in which R> and R7 are as defined above, and salts thereof.The term "lipophilic and/or electron withdrawing group" refers to groups such as halogen, in particular chlorine, nitro, cyano, Cχ-4alkanoyl, optionally substituted phenylCι_4alkanoyl and fluorinated Cι-4alk l such as trifluoromethyl. Other examples of such groups will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Suitable Cι_4alkano l groups
