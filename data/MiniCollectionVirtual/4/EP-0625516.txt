<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel group of compounds which are useful in
the treatment of bladder instability in manuals such as man. More specifically, this
invention relates to this group of compounds, their use in the treatment of urinary
incontinence in manuals (including man), processes for preparing them and
pharmaceutical compositions containing them.It is known that bladder tissue is excitable and that urinary incontinence
can be caused by uncontrolled or unstable bladder contractions. A group of
compounds have been found that are unexpectedly capable of relaxing bladder smooth
muscle, thus preventing or ameliorating uncontrolled or unstable bladder contractions.
Hence, the compounds may be useful for the treatment of urge incontinence, which
includes for example detrusor instability, which may result from cystitis, urethritis,
tumors, stones, diverticuli or outflow obstruction; and detrusor hyperreflexia, which
may result from stroke, dementia, Parkinsons, suprasacral spinalcord injury or
suprasacral spinalcord disease. Substituted amides which are useful in the treatment
of urinary incontinence in mammals are disclosed in European Patent Application
EP0524781. Analogues of sulfasalazine which are useful as anti-inflammatory agents
and which have a structure related to the compounds of the present invention are
disclosed in International Patent Application WO 93/10094.This invention provides a compound of formula I (formula set out,
together with other formulae referred to by Roman numerals, on pages following the
Examples), wherein:
either R1 and R2 are each selected independently from hydrogen, (1-3C)alkyl,
pyridyl and phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or two
substituents selected independently from (1-4C)alkyl, (1-4C)alkoxy, (2-4C)alkenyloxy,
hydroxy, halo and cyano,or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached
form morpholino, thiomorpholino, piperidinyl or pyirolidinyl;A-B is selected from NHCO, OCH2, SCH2, NHCH2, trans-vinylene, and
ethynylene; R3 and R4 are independently (1-3C)alkyl substituted by from 0 to 2k+1 atoms
selected from fluoro and chloro wherein k is the number of carbon atoms in the said
(1-3C)alkyl, provided that R3 and R4 are not both methyl; or R3 and R4, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached,
form a 3-5 membered cycloalkyl ring optionally substituted by from 0 to 2m-2
fluorine atoms wherein m is the number of carbon atoms in said ring; andR5 is hydrogen, (1-4C)alkyl, (1-4C)haloalkyl, (1-4C)alkoxy,
