<ABSTRACT>
In a switching arrangement for reducing the static current consumption in a parked motor vehicle with a controllable switch for centralised disconnection of essentially all loads of the vehicle's electrical system from the vehicle battery, the input of the electric supply of an electric anti-theft device is connected to the vehicle battery in a non-disconnectable way. The electric anti-theft device preferably receives an input signal corresponding to the position of the controllable switch and interrogates the position of a switch which is to be activated manually in order to set and deactivate the anti-theft device less often when the controllable switch is opened than when the controllable switch is closed.

<CLAIMS>
A switching arrangement for reducing the static current consumption of
parked motor vehicles, comprising a controllable switch for centrally

disconnecting substantially all on-board loads from the vehicle battery,
wherein the electric supply input of an electric anti-theft device (5) is

inseparably connected to the vehicle battery (1), bypassing the controllable
switch (S
S
), 
characterised in that
 the electric anti-theft device (5) receives
an input signal corresponding to the position of the controllable switch (S
S
)
and interrogates the position of a manually actuated switch (S
T
) for setting or
deactivating the anti-theft device (5) less often (f
2
) when the controllable
switch is open (S
S
=0) than when the controllable switch is closed (S
S
=1).
A switching arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

an equipment-on indicator lamp (6) associated with the anti-theft device (5) is
actuated so that when the controllable switch is open (S
S
=0) it flashes less
often and/or more briefly than when the controllable switch is closed (S
S
=1).
A switching arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the opened controllable switch (S
S
=0) is re-closed when the manual
switch (S
T
) for focusing or deactivating the anti-theft device (5) is brought into
the position for deactivation.
A switching arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 when the controllable switch is re-closed (S
S
=1) a
monitor (4) is activated and indicates th
e controllable switch which was
previously open (S
S
=0).
