<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain novel compounds, in 
particular novel benzopyran derivatives, to processes 
for their preparation, to compositions containing such 
compounds and to the use of such compounds and 
compositions in medicine. European Patent Applications, Publication Numbers 
76075, 93535, 95316, 107423, 120426, 126311, 126350, 
126367, 138134, 250077, 273262 and 298452 describe 
certain benzopyran derivatives having interalia 
antihypertensive activity. EP-A-176689 also discloses 
that certain benzopyran derivatives are useful for the 
treatment of interalia disorders of the respiratory 
system. European Patent Application, Publication Number 314446 
also discloses certain benzopyran derivatives used in 
the treatment of hypertension, this disclosure is 
relevant to the present application only by virtue of 
Article 54(3) EPC. A group of novel benzopyran derivatives has now been 
discovered which surprisingly has smooth muscle 
relaxant activity, and such compounds are therefore 
potentially useful as bronchodilators in the treatment 
of disorders of the respiratory tract, such as 
reversible airways obstruction and asthma, and also in 
the treatment of hypertension. Such compounds are also 
indicated to be of potential use in the treatment of 
disorders associated with smooth muscle contraction of 
the gastro-intestinal tract, uterus or the urinary 
tract including the ureter. Such disorders 
respectively include irritable bowel syndrome and  
 
diverticular disease; premature labour; incontinence; 
renal cholic and disorders associated with the passage 
of kidney stones. They are also indicated as of 
potential use in the treatment of cardiovascular 
disorders other than hypertension, such as congestive 
heart failure, angina, peripheral vascular disease and 
cerebral vascular disease; and also in the treatment 
and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with 
pulmonary hypertension and of disorders associated with 
right heart failure. These compounds are also indicated to have potential 
use as anti-convulsants in the treatment of epilepsy. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound 
of formula (I): 
or, where appropriate, a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate 
thereof
 
wherein:
 
one of A₁ or A₂ represents hydrogen and the other 
represents a group CF₃-Y- wherein Y represents -CF₂-, 
>C=O, or -CH(OH)-;
 
 
Y₁ represents -O-, -CH₂- or NRo wherein Ro is hydrogen, 
alkyl or alkylcarbonyl;R₁ and R₂ independently 
represent
