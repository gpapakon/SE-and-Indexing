<ABSTRACT>
An immunological reagent capable of binding to T cells 
and having specificity for an amino acid sequence within 

the variable region of the β-chain of the T cell antigen 
receptor of T cells associated with a specific disease, 

or a nucleic acid capable of binding specifically to a 
nucleic acid encoding such an amino acid sequence, may be 

used as such or as a molecular delivery system for the 
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of that 

disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
T cells are derived from the thymus and accordingly 
they are called T cells. They circulate freely through 
the blood and lymphatic vessels of the body, and so are 
able to detect and react against foreign invaders, i.e. 
viruses, allergens, tumors and autoantigens. Despite 
their uniform morphology under microscope, T cells 
consist of a heterogeneous population of cells with 
several distinct functional subsets called helpers, 
suppressors and killers [Kung, P. S. and Goldstein, G., 
Vox Sanquinis 39:121 (1980); Reinherz, E. L. and 
Schlossman, S. F., Cell 19:821 (1980).] Through a recognition system called the T cell antigen 
receptor, T cells are able to detect the presence of 
invading pathogens and direct release of multiple, 
distinct T cell lymphokines called T cell factors, 
which instruct B lymphocytes to initiate or suppress 
antibody production, and regulate the white blood 
system in producing more phagocytes and other white 
cells to neutralize the pathogens, and destroy tumor 
cells and virally infected cells. Thus, the detection 
and binding of pathogens by T cells is linked to the 
triggering of T cell factor release and to the cascade 
of host defense actions initiated by these factors 
[Kung, P. S. and Goldstein, G., Vox Sanquinis 39:121 
(1980); Reinherz, E. L. and Schlossman, S. F., Cell 
19:821 (1980).] T cell antigen receptors are different from other T 
cell surface markers in two major ways: a) there are  
 
millions of distinct T cells in the body involved in 
disease fighting, and each T cell clone bears a unique 
T cell antigen receptor [Fathman, C. G. and Frelinger, 
J. G., Ann Rev. Immunol. 1:633 (1983),] and b) T cell 
antigen receptors have a known function in antigen 
binding. The functions of other T cell surface markers 
identifiable by commercially available OKT™ and Leu™ 
monoclonal antibodies remain largely unknown. These 
markers do not have the structural variabilities found 
in the T cell antigen receptor. Additionally, it 
appears that the receptor is the only molecule truly 
specific for T cells [Meuer, S. C., et al., Ann. Rev. 
Immunol. 2:23 (1984).] Since T cells carry out a variety of regulatory and 
defense functions, they play a central role in immuno-logic 
responses. These responses include destroying 
self cells which have been virally or neoplastically 
transformed (T killer cells), helping B cells which 
make antibody molecules to differentiate and express 
their secreted gene products (T helper cells) and 
suppressing immune responses (T suppressor
