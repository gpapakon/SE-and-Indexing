<ABSTRACT>
A dish support is rotatably mounted on a base (2). An 
electrical heating element heats the support and dishes 

resting on its surface. The support is preferably mounted 
on rollers (10) which run in a track (13) on the base (2). 

Thermal 
storage means in the support store heat supplied by the 

element. The support can be picked up and removed from the 
base to connect the element and thereby heat the storage 

medium. It can then be discontinued and placed on the base 
so that the dishes can be kept warm by the stored heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrically powered 
rotatable food server of the kind in which a dish support 
has a surface for receiving dishes of food, the dish support 
is rotatably mounted on a base and an electrically heating 
element heats the dish support and hence dishes resting on 
its surface. EP-A-0 335 151 and EP-A-0 465 746 each disclose heated 
turntables including a dish support secured to, but 
rotatable on a base, the base having terminals for 
connection to a power supply. Electrical heating pads in 
the dish support, which are thermostatically controlled, 
supply heat directly to dishes placed on the pads when the 
base terminals are connected to a power supply. Poles 
pieces connected to the heating pads make sliding contact 
with pole pieces on the base so that current can be 
continuously supplied to the pads whilst the base is 
connected to the supply and when the turntable is rotated. 
In EP-A-0 465 746 the thermal pads are located within the 
recesses on the dish support to permit air to flow between 
the support and a dish placed on the pad to promote heat 
exchange. A problem with the foregoing arrangements is that the 
dish support and base form a unit which is connected to the 
power supply in order to feed current continuously to the 
heating pads to keep the dishes warm. As the turntable is 
intended for use on a dining table, it is inconvenient to 
have a power supply lead connected to the unit. A lead 
trailing across the table is unattractive and it takes up 
space otherwise required for the purpose of dining. Also, 
there is a risk that a user could accidentally trip over the 
trailing lead thereby causing disconnection and/or pulling 
the unit across the table. EP-A-0 447 724 discloses a food warming system which  
 
would give rise to similar problems. US-A-4 119 834 
discloses a food warmer which employs heating lamps above 
trays mounted on a column. The column is rotatable about 
a base and the base has an electrical lead for connection to 
a power supply to feed current to the lamps. This 
arrangement suffers from similar problems, besides being too 
bulky for use on a dining table. The present invention seeks to avoid these problems and 
to provide an electrically powered food surface which is 
more convenient to use. In accordance with the invention, an electrically 
powered, rotatable food server comprises a dish support 
having a surface for receiving dishes of food; a base on 
which the dish support is rotatably mounted; an electrical 
heating element for

<CLAIMS>
An electrically powered, rotatable food server 
comprising a dish support having a surface for receiving 

dishes of food; a base on which the dish support is 
rotatably mounted; an electrical heating element for 

heating the dish support and hence said surface; guide 
means and transport means respectively provided on the base 

and the dish support, or vice versa, to facilitate guided 
rotation of the dish support on the base; and thermal 

storage means in the dish support for storing heat supplied 
by the element, the guide means and transport means 

cooperating so that the dish support is independent of the 
base, which enables the dish support to be picked up by a 

user and removed from the base, the element being 
subsequently connectable to a power source for supplying 

heat to the storage medium and disconnectable to enable the 
dish support to be replaced on the base whereby dishes are 

kept warm by the heat stored in the storage medium. 
A food server according to Claim 1 wherein the guide 
means are provided on the base in the form of a circular 

track, the transport means being rollers on the dish 
support, which sit in or on the track. 
A food server according to Claim 1 wherein the transport 
means are rollers provided on the base and the guide means 

is a track on the dish support. 
A food server according to any of Claims 1-3 wherein the 
thermal storage means is in the form of a disc on which the 

heating element or elements are mounted, the disc comprising 
or being made from a thermal storage medium. 
A food server according to any preceding Claim wherein 
the thermal storage means comprises a substance which 

changes state at a predetermined temperature. 
A food server according to Claim 4 wherein an insulated 
frame or rim, of annular form, surrounds the periphery of 

the disc to provide a cool surface which can be touched by 
users to rotate the dish support. 
A food server according to Claim 4 or 6 wherein the 
upper surface of the disc is either substantially flat, or 

recessed so as to receive suitably shaped dishes.
