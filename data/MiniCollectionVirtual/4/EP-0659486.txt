<ABSTRACT>
A self-propelled crushing machine comprising a hopper (11) and a crusher (8) connected to said hopper mounted on a vehicle 
body (1) provided with a travelling equipment (19), wherein a bottom plate (51) of said hopper (11) is reciprocatingly movable 

horizontally in the direction of a charge opening (8b) of the crusher (8). With this arrangement, the bottom plate (51) of the 
hopper (11) temporarily receives material to be crushed, and thereafter, delivers and drops the material into the charge opening 

(8b) of the crusher (8), so that, even if the gravity of the material and the amount of charge into the hopper are varied, the substantially 
equal amount of material to be crushed can be delivered into the crusher per unit time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-propelling crushing machine with the features
cited in the preamble of claim 1. This crushing machine is for crushing an object of
crush, such as concrete waste and so forth in a site of taking down a building or the
like.In a crushing machine of this type disclosed in JP-U-64 32744, the hopper is located
above the crusher and connected to the inlet of the crusher by means of a narrow
feeding channel. The material to be crushed has to pass this channel which bears the
danger that the channel is blocked by the material itself. The motor for the crusher is
provided between and in line with the crusher and the driving power source.JP-A-62 040 687 describes a crushing machine mounted on a follower having a
hopper at the rear end and a motor at the front side thereof and in the middle of the
width of the follower. The hopper is provided with a bottom plate which is positioned at
the rear end of the follower. By a reciprocal movement of the bottom plate, the
material to be crushed is discharged to an inlet of the crusher. The crushed material is
discharged via an outlet at the bottom of the crusher into a container which has to be
embedded in the ground.JP-A-03 130 859 discloses a crushing machine which is embodied as a lorry having
the driver's cab with the engine in the front while a crusher and a hopper are
distanced thereto in the back instead of a loading platform. A motor for the crusher is
provided at an intermediate position between the crusher and the driver's cab and
distanced to the latter one.DE-U-91 15 117 discloses a crushing machine mounted on a follower. A hopper is
located at the rear end of the follower while the driving power source is located at the
front side in the middle of the follower.It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved crushing machine of
the above-mentioned type which is compact to be operable in small working sites and
enables an easier feeding and conveyance of the material. According to the present invention, this object is attained with a crushing machine
having the features cited in claim 1.Advantageous features and embodiments are cited in the dependent claims. With the construction set forth above, the
bottom plate of the hopper once receives the object of
crush and then feed it into the charge inlet of the
crusher by reciprocal motion. As a result, substantially
constant amount of the object of crush may be fed into
the crusher per a unit period, even when the own weight
of the object of crush or the charge
</DESCRIPTION>
