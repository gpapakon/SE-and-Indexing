<ABSTRACT>
In the method proposed, the flue gases are scrubbed (3) with a solution containing an alkali. The scrubbing solution is then purified, before or after an oxidation stage (4), in an operation (6) comprising a combination of sedimentation and membrane filtration. At least a part of the solids in the concentrate obtained from the membrane filtration is separated off by sedimentation and the remaining liquid fed back to the membrane-filtration process and hence into the main circuit, and the alkali-metal sulphate crystallized out. A pure-white alkali-metal sulphate free of dark-coloured impurities is thus obtained inexpensively.

<CLAIMS>
A process for desulfurizing flue gases, the flue gas being scrubbed 
with an alkali-metal-containing liquor, more especially sodium hydroxide, 

preferably after the removal of fly ash and other solid particles, and the alkali 
metal sulfate obtained after an oxidation stage being subsequently 

crystallized, characterized in that, after scrubbing of the flue gas, the 
scrubbing liquor is purified, more particularly continuously, in a combined 

working-up step consisting of sedimentation and membrane filtration, 
preferably crossflow membrane filtration, the solids in the concentrate 

obtained after the membrane filtration being at least partly removed by 
sedimentation, the residual liquid is returned to the membrane filtration and 

hence circulated and the permeate obtained from the membrane filtration is 
further processed. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the scrubbing 
liquor to be purified is first subjected to the membrane filtration. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a ratio of 
permeate to concentrate of at least 10:1 is adjusted in the membrane 

filtration. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
membrane is cleaned by back-washing, more particularly periodic back-washing, 

with permeate. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
membranes used have pore diameters smaller by a factor of at least 5 than 

the average diameter of the particles suspended in the scrubbing liquor. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
membrane consists of a polymer, more especially polypropylene. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
membrane consists of ceramic, more especially aluminum oxide or aluminium 

oxide/zirconium oxide or graphite/zirconium oxide or silicon carbide. 
An installation for desulfurizing smoke gases comprising a gas  
 

scrubber (3) which is designed to be operated with an alkali-metal-containing 
liquor, more especially sodium hydroxide, and which preferably is preceded 

by a separation stage (2) for the removal of fly ash and other solids from the 
flue gas and followed by an oxidation stage (4) for the preparation of alkali 

metal sulfate and by a crystallizer (5), characterized in that at least one 
sedimentation tank (7) and at least one membrane filtration module (9), more 

especially a crossflow membrane filtration module, are arranged between the 
scrubber (3) and the crystallizer (5) and in that the concentrate outlet of the 

module (9) is directed to the sedimentation tank (7) while the overflow (8) of 
the sedimentation tank (7) is directed to the module (9). 
An installation as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that the module 
(9) is equipped with a microfiltration membrane. 
An installation as claimed in claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the feed 
line (12) for the scrubbing liquor to be purified is connected to the inlet of the 

module (9).
