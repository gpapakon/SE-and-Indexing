<ABSTRACT>
Process for the isomerisation of external olefins to internal olefins, the feedstock also containing diolefins, with a catalyst based on palladium and containing 0.05 to 10 % of sulphur (by weight), the said catalyst being treated before it is charged into the reactor with at least one organic sulphur compound diluted in a solvent, and then activated under a neutral or reducing atmosphere at a temperature of between 20 and 300 DEG C, before being brought into contact with the feedstock.
