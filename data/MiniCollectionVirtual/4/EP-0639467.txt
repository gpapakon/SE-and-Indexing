<ABSTRACT>
A printing drum mounted rotatably in a printing 
machine, the printing drum including an ink-permeable 

peripheral wall (1), with ink being feedable from the 
inside of the ink-permeable peripheral wall (1), and an 

ink-permeable screen (4) formed of a heat-shrinkable 
material and held in a heat-shrinkable manner in close 

contact with the outer peripheral surface of the ink-permeable 
peripheral wall (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing drum to 
be mounted in a printing machine such as, for example, a 
mimeographing machine, as well as a method for producing 
the same. Fig. 4 illustrates a conventional printing drum 10 
mounted in a mimeographing machine. The printing drum 10 
has a cylindrical, peripheral wall 1 in which there are 
formed a large number of fine holes for the passage of 
ink therethrough. Inside the peripheral wall 1 is 
disposed an ink feeder though not shown. On the outer 
peripheral surface of the cylindrical, peripheral wall 1 
is provided a stencil clamping means 2 in parallel with 
the axis of the peripheral wall 1. Further, two ink-permeable screens 11 and 12 are 
wound one upon the other round the outer peripheral 
surface of the peripheral wall 1. The screens 11 and 12 
are for dispersing the ink which has passed through the 
fine holes of the peripheral wall 1 uniformly throughout 
the whole of the printing area on the printing drum and 
also function to hold an appropriate amount of the ink to 
make clear and uniform printing possible. The screen 11 
as an inner screen is of a relatively large mesh, while 
the screen 12 as an outer screen is of a relatively small  
 
mesh. One end portions of both screens 11 and 12 are fixed 
to the clamp means 2 with bolts 13 or the like. The 
screens 11 and 12 are put one upon the other and wound 
round the peripheral wall 1. The opposite end portions 
of both screens 11 and 12 are provided with elongated 
strip-like edge members 14 and 15, respectively. As 
shown in Fig. 5, both side portions of the edge members 
14 and 15 are connected together by means of clip members 
16. The edge members 14 and 15 thus rendered integral 
with each other are then mounted to the clamp means 2 
through springs 17, as shown in Fig. 6. Both screens 11 
and 12 are brought into close contact with the outer 
peripheral surface of the peripheral wall 1 by the 
biasing force of the springs 17. For performing the operation of winding the screens 
11 and 12 round the peripheral wall 1 and then fixing 
them with springs 17 the printing drum 10 is fixed onto a 
fixing jig 20, as shown in Fig. 4. According to the conventional printing drum 10 
described above, there has been the problem that the 
construction for mounting the screens 11 and 12 onto the 
peripheral wall 1 is complicated, the number of 
components is large, and it is necessary to provide a 
special jig. Further, since the springs 17 have a strong biasing 
force, if they are not securely

A printing drum for mounting rotatably in a 
printing machine, said printing drum including: 


an ink-permeable peripheral wall (1) with ink being 
feedable from the inside of said peripheral wall (1) to 

effect printing; and 
an ink-permeable screen (30) wound round the outer 
peripheral surface of said peripheral wall (1) with a 

stencil wound round said ink-permeable screen (30); 
characterised in that: 


a fixing means (31) formed of a heat-shrinkable material 
connects both end portions (30a,30a) of said screen (30) 

with each other and, by its own heat-shrinkage, holds the 
screen (30) in close contact with said peripheral wall (1). 
A printing drum for mounting rotatably in a 
printing machine, said printing drum including: 


an ink-permeable peripheral wall (1) with ink being 
feedable from the inside of said peripheral wall (1) to 

effect printing; and 
an ink-permeable screen (40) wound round the outer 
peripheral surface of said peripheral wall (1) with a 

stencil wound round said ink-permeable screen (40); 
characterised in that: 


a fixing means (41) formed of a heat-shrinkable 
material fixes at least one end portion (40a) of said  

 
screen (40) to said peripheral wall (1) and, by its own 

heat-shrinkage, holds the screen (40) in close contact with 
said peripheral wall (1). 
A method for producing a printing drum to be 
mounted rotatably in a printing machine, said printing drum 

including: 


an ink-permeable peripheral wall (1) with ink being 
feedable from the inside of said peripheral wall to effect 

printing; and 
an ink-permeable screen wound round the outer 
peripheral surface of said peripheral wall (1) with a 

stencil wound round said peripheral wall (1) characterised 
in that: 


the method comprises the steps of winding said screen 
(30,40) round the outer peripheral surface of said peripheral 

wall (1), said ink-permeable screen connecting both end 
portions (30a,40a) of said screen (30,40) by a fixing means (31,41) 

formed of a heat shrinkable material and thereafter causing 
said fixing means (31,41) to shrink thermally, thereby causing 

the screen (30,40) to come into close contact with said 
peripheral wall (1).
