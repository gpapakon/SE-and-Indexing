<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device on a controllable-pitch marine propeller, in particular a cycloidal marine propeller, for protecting the same against corrosion. The invention is characterized in that insulating surfaces or insulating parts are arranged at the bearing points on the propeller blades. The insulating surfaces or insulating parts electrically insulate the propeller blades from the bearing supports (bearing housings) or reduce the current transfer to the latter by their high electrical resistance to values which are harmless for electrolytic corrosion.

Variable-pitch ship's propeller, in particular cycloidal
ship's propeller, with a device for protecting same against

corrosion, characterised in that insulating surfaces (54, 55,
56) or insulating parts (50, 51, 52) are located at the bearings

(10, 11, 15) on the propeller blades, which insulate the
propeller blades (2) electrically from the bearing supports (37,

38, 39) or reduce the passage of current to the latter due to
their high electrical resistance, to values which are harmless

for electrolytic corrosion.
Variable-pitch ship's propeller, in particular cycloidal
ship's propeller with a device according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the insulating surfaces are an insulating
coating (54, 55, 56) on the bearing bushes (10, 11, 15) in the

region of the shafts (23) of the propeller blades (2).
Variable-pitch ship's propeller, in particular cycloidal
ship's propeller with a device according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that the insulating coating consists of ceramic
material, such as oxide ceramic or carbide.
Variable-pitch ship's propeller, in particular cycloidal
ship's propeller, with a device according to one of Claims 1 to

3, characterised in that the insulating coating is provided
radially on the outside of the bearing bushes.
Variable-pitch ship's propeller, in particular cycloidal
ship's propeller, with a device according to one of Claims 1 to

4, characterised in that in the axial direction the bearing
bushes are separated by insulating discs (50, 51, 52) from the

bearing supports.
Variable-pitch ship's propeller, in particular cycloidal
ship's p
ropeller, with a device according to one of Claims 1 to
4, characterised in that in the case of a cycloidal ship's 

propeller, the bearing bush (15) adjacent the blade of the
connecting rod (18) serving for the adjustment of the individual

blade (2) is electrically insulated in the axial direction by
insulating discs (51, 52) with respect to the adjusting lever

(19, 20) thereof connected to the blade shaft (8).
