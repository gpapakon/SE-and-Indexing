<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to an all-digital
motor control system and, more particularly, to a system for
controlling the speed or armature position of a motor.Speed control systems for controlling the speed of
motors are generally known. However, such systems rely, at
least in part, on analog signals and an analog-to-digital
converter to convert the analog signals to digital signals
for subsequent processing by digital signal processors.
This adds hardware complexity and rigidity to the overall
system. Also, the reliance on analog signals, at least in
part, introduces an element of inaccuracy in motor speed
control. It is a general object of this invention to advance the state of
the art of control for motors.It is another object of this invention to reduce the hardware
requirement and system rigidity in such control systems.Another object of this invention is to provide all digital motor
control systems, and with the attendant advantage of accuracy and
speed of response.Another subject of the invention is to provide a motor control
system which has particular application in surgical procedures.Another is to provide a system which accurately controls
surgical pumps, and motor driven surgical tools.In our earlier European patent application EP-A-566297, we disclose
an all-digital brushless motor control system wherein the controller
includes a single look-up table having bit patterns wherein each
pattern corresponds to a different armature position.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an
all-digital control system for a motor having an armature,
comprising:
(a) a main digital signal processor for supplying a digital input
command signal indicative of a desired motor operation;(b) a drive controller in digital communication with the main
processor, for generating, for each phase of the motor, and
in response to the command signal, a digital commutation signal to
move the armature, and a digital pulse width modulated signal
having a duty cycle established by the input command signal;(c) switching means in digital communication with the
controller, for generating, for each phase, and in response to each 
commutation signal and each pulse width modulated signal, a digital
two-state control signal having an on-state which lasts for said duty
cycle;(d) means in digital communication with the controller, for
generating, for each phase, a digital tachometer signal indicative of
armature position;(e) said controller being further operative for processing the
tachometer signal, to
