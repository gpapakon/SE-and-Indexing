<ABSTRACT>
A guide bar for the protective hood of wood shaping machines has a clamping element that can be secured in the vertical groove of a protective hood of wood shaping machines. The clamping element (46) consists of a plunger (48) coupled to the guide bar (40) which has a mushroom-shaped enlarged head (50) which engages the vertical groove (32) having a C-shaped cross section. The plunger head (50) consists of two parts movable against each other and expandable against the walls (34, 36) of the groove.

<CLAIMS>
A guide bar with a clamping component for height adjustable fastening in a vertical 
groove - with a C shaped cross section - of a protective hood for wood shaping 

machines, the clamping component having a plunger with a head extended in a 
mushroom shape and lockable in the vertical groove by means of an adjusting screw, 


characterised in that
 the head (50) comprises two circular-disc head components (52, 
54) displaceable towards each other by means of the adjusting screw (68), and able to 

be pushed apart towards the walls (34, 36) of the vertical groove (32). 
A guide bar according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a square locking structure 
(74) for engaging between the boundary edges of the vertical groove (32) is formed on 

that lower side of the stationary head component (54) which is directed towards the 
guide rail (40). 
A guide bar according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the plunger (48) is 
displaceable and lockable by means of the adjusting screw (68) which passes through an 

elongate hole (72) of the guide rail (40) and which is in a recess (44) of the guide rail 
(40). 
A guide rail according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the 
head component (52) located at the free end of the head (50), is fastened at the end of a 

rod (56) mounted in the plunger (48) so as to be longitudinally displaceable . 
A guide rail according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the end (58) of the rod (56) 
turned away from the head component (52) has an inclined surface (62) and rests on a 

wedge (64) radially adjustable inside the plunger (48). 
A guide rail according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that
 the rod (56) is pulled by 
means of a spring (60) in the direction of the release position. 
A guide rail according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 the adjusting screw (68) 
is screwed into a tapped hole of the wedge (64).
