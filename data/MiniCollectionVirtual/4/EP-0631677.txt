<ABSTRACT>
This invention teaches replacing less relevant sections of a document with a pattern that can be described in a limited data space. The original document is re-displayed as a combination of the relevant sections against a background of the patterns. This approach leads to a reduction in the space occupied by the document in memory, leads to more rapid retrieval and display of selected portions of the document and facilitates rapid reading comprehension of the outline meaning of the document or finding the location of desired sections within the document.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for storing and displaying a 
document and in particular to such a method and apparatus that provides for data 
reduction of the document whilst still allowing for the rapid retrieval and display of 
selected portions of the document. This facilitates rapid reading comprehension of the 
outline meaning of the document or finding the location of desired sections within the 
document. Electronic storage and retrieval of texts and images is well known, finding wide usage 
wherever text or image documents have to be stored in a manner that allows fast 
subsequent access, as for example, with commercial databases such as those that store 
and allow retrieval of patent information. Personal computers with word processing 
programs also allow electronic text storage and retrieval. More recently, portable CD-ROM 
readers, such as the Sony Data Discman (Regd. Trademarks) are more 
specifically dedicated to this task. One of the advantages of electronic, as opposed to print based, storage of documents is 
that electronic systems can incorporate intelligent features. For example, it is generally 
possible to interrogate a remote commercial computer database using keyword 
searching from the user's terminal to locate only those references that contain a 
specified keyword. Once the relevant document or documents are located on the remote 
host computer, a copy may be displayed at the user's access terminal. Often, the 
keyword specified will be highlighted against the text of the rest of the document to 
guide the user to the relevant portions of the text. One problem with this approach is 
that the full text of the document is supplied and displayed. This process can be 
5 unnecessarily slow and expensive since extraneous text may not only have to be 
retrieved from storage in the host, but this extraneous text has to be transmitted and 
displayed. Scrolling through the full text to locate the highlighted words can also be 
slow. In addition, the less disciplined reader will probably not move straight to the  
 
highlighted keyword to check for relevancy of context but may instead waste time 
reading the extraneous text too. Further , it is anticipated that electronic successors to 
conventional approaches to text storage, such as books and newspapers, will have to 
offer the user specific advantages over their conventional counterparts. Currently, these 
electronic equivalents rely on the CD-ROM format, which gives the advantage of 
allowing very considerable

Method of displaying selected portions of an original document, in which the 
original document comprises text or graphics arranged in a layout, comprising the steps 

of: 

dividing the original document into selected portions (21) which are to be 
displayed and text (22) or graphics (23) portions which are not to be displayed and are instead 

to be removed; 
generating at least one space or pattern corresponding in length and/or shape to 
the text or graphics which are to be removed, each space or pattern being 

described by less data than is needed to describe the text or graphics which are to be 
removed; 
displaying on a screen only the selected portions, said selected portions being 
arranged in the same layout that each portion had in the original document and being 

separated from other selected portions by at least one of said generated space or pattern. 
Method of storing an original document, in which the original document 
comprises text or graphics arranged in a layout, comprising the steps of; 


dividing the original document into selected portions (21) which are to be 
displayed and text (22) or graphics (23) portions which are not to be displayed and are instead 

to be removed; 
generating at least one space or pattern corresponding in length and/or shape to 
the text or graphics which are to be removed, each space or pattern being 

described by less data than is needed to describe the text or graphics which are to be 
removed; 
recording onto a recordable media the original document and said space 
or pattern such that the recordable media allows the display on a screen of only the 

selected portions of the original document, said selected portions being arranged in the same 
layout that each portion had in the original document and being separated from other selected 

portions by at least one of said generated space or pattern generated. 
Method as claimed in either claim 1 or 2 wherein the space or pattern is stored, 
together with the selected portions, in a separate file from a file containing the whole 

document. 
Method as claimed in either claim 1 or 2 wherein the selected portions are 
flagged portions of the data file representing the whole document.  

 
Method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the selected portions are 
selected to allow speed reading. 
Method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the selected portions include 
keywords. 
Computer apparatus for displaying selected portions of an original document, in 
which the original document comprises text or graphics arranged in a layout, 

comprising: 

a data store in which the original document is stored, the data store also storing 
data indicative of selected portions (21) of the original document; 
a processor to generate on a display at least one space or pattern 
equal in length and/or shape to text (22) or graphics (23) which are to be removed from the 

original document, each space or pattern being described by less data than is 
needed to describe the text or graphics which is to be removed; 
a display to display those selected portions, said selected portions being 
displayed in the same layout that each portion had in the original document and being 

separated from other selected portions by at least one of said space or pattern generated by the 
processor.
