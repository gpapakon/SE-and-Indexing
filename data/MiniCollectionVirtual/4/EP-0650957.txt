<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aniline derivative useful as an intermediate 
of agricultural chemicals or the like and a process of its production. It has hitherto been known that 5-(3-butyn-2-yloxy)-4-chloro-2-fluoroaniline 
is useful as an intermediate of agricultural chemicals, and it has also been known that this 
compound can be produced from (5-amino-2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)methyl carbonate. 
The (5-amino-2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)methyl carbonate can be obtained by the nitration 
and subsequent reduction of (2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)methyl carbonate which is obtained 
by the reaction of 2-chloro-4-fluorophenol with halocarbonic acid methyl ester (JP-A 
310855/1988, EP-0,061,741 and JP-A 42042/1990). In this process, however, there is a problem in the operating characteristics 
because (2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)methyl carbonate as the starting material is in the form 
of crystals (m.p.: 69-71°C) at ordinary temperature and it requires complicated handling 
operations in the reaction step; therefore, this process cannot be said to be a favorable 
process from an industrial point of view. Accordingly, there has been a demand for the development of a process for 
producing 5-(3-butyn-2-yloxy)-4-chloro-2-fluoroaniline by no way of (2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)methyl 
carbonate. The present inventors have studied such a production process and found 
(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)ethyl carbonate having an extremely low melting point and in oil 
form at ordinary temperature, which is therefore easy to handle. Further, they have also 
found that this compound can easily be converted into (5-amino-2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)ethyl 
carbonate by its nitration and subsequent reduction with good selectivity and 
(5-amino-2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)ethyl carbonate can easily be led to 5-(3-butyn-2-yloxy)-4-chloro-2-fluoroaniline 
with good selectivity in the same manner as the conventional  
 
compound, thereby completing the present invention. That is, the present invention provides an aniline derivative of the chemical 
formula [I]: 
and a process of its production. The following will fully describe the present invention. The aniline derivative of the chemical formula [I] as the desired compound 
of the present invention can be obtained by the reduction of a nitrobenzene derivative of 
the chemical formula [II]: 
   As the method for the reduction of the nitrobenzene derivative, there can be 
mentioned catalytic hydrogenation or chemical reduction, and the reduction may be carried 
out by either of these methods. In the
