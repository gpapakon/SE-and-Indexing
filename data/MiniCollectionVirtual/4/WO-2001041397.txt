<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for reducing delay in the transmission of a plurality of packets by performing IP scheduling and header compression at various layers in a multilayer architecture having a plurality of classifications includes scheduling packets according to classifications. If congestion occurs during scheduling, packets may be discarded. Some packet headers may be compressed thereafter. Packets may further be queued in a first and a second queue, after scheduling, discarding, and compressing, according to at least two classifications. Best Efforts packets may be queued into the lower priority second queue. Classifications may be associated with, for example, QoS levels, delay factors, LFI, and Multilink PPP. Scheduling is performed at higher or lower layers in a multi-layer protocol. The lower layer includes a PPP layer. The lower layer may also include an HDLC layer which creates a tag for packets prior to compression being performed thereupon. The tag may be added to packets at some point thereafter. Tags are removed prior to transmission. An outbound packet queue having a queue depth of no greater than one ensures no more than one Best Efforts packet wait time.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PACKET DELAY REDUCTION USING SCHEDULING AND HEADER COMPRESSIONBACKGROUNDThe present invention relates to multiplex communication systems for transferring information in packets and more particularly, to scheduling and header compression of packets in a multilayered network architecture.Modern communications networks carry increasing amounts of packet traffic which is associated with real-time voice, video, and related data. The Internet, for example, is seeing many new applications which take advantage of what is a relatively less costly alternative to conventional telephone call connections for sending a variety of data including real time voice and video. Trends toward real time applications over the Internet are driven in part by increasingly powerful computers being installed in private homes and the proliferation of the Internet as a focal point for various on-line activities such as holding voice conversations, listening to music, watching video clips, and the like. Unlike Internet communications which occur between computers on high bandwidth commercial connections, bandwidth in a typical home is limited by connectivity constraints imposed by modem speed, line quality, and the like. Further compounding the basic problem of limited bandwidth, is the limitation on the amount of actual information transmitted as a result of packet overhead due to protocol headers. Basic Internet protocols were developed primarily for making sure that packets were delivered accurately end to end at a time when little consideration was paid to real time issues.Three layer interface architectures including protocols such as X.25, for example, were developed for controlling transfer at the lower levels while higher 

layer protocols were developed to control more sophisticated functions (see, "Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) - New International Standards Architectures and Protocols for Distributed Information Systems," special issue, Proceedings of the IEEE, H.C. Folts and R. des Jardins, eds., vol. 71, no. 12, Dec. 1983). According to the design philosophy, lower layer functions were contemplated to be "transparent" to higher layer functionality and thus much of what can be accomplished at the lower layers is limited only by the ability of lower layer hardware and software to preserve that transparency. At the lowest layer, the Physical Layer, a protocol specification governs the physical connection between devices, such as, for example, the X.21 protocol. Next, the Data Link Layer specifies
