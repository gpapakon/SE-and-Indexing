<ABSTRACT>
Rotary actuator arc compensation correction method and 
apparatus are provided for a direct access storage device 

(DASD). A reference feedforward correction signal (64) is 
generated at each of a plurality of sectors around a 

predetermined track on a disk surface. A specific selected 
track is identified, and both magnitude and phase of the 

generated reference feedforward correction signal are 
modified to correct for the arced trajectory caused by the 

rotary actuator (58) at the specific selected track. Improved 
actuator servo control is provided by using pseudo sector 

compensation to interpolate the feedforward correction signal 
between servo sectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for
rotary actuator arc compensation correction in a direct
access storage device (DASD).Computers often include auxiliary memory storage units having
media on which data can be written and from which data can be
read for later use. Disk drive units incorporating stacked,
commonly rotated rigid magnetic disks are used for storage of
data in magnetic form on the disk surfaces. Data is recorded
in concentric, radially spaced data information tracks
arrayed on the surfaces of the disks. Transducer heads
driven in a path toward and away from the drive axis write
data to the disks and read data from the disks.All DASD units must have a method to position each data head
over the proper radial location to write a track and again,
to position it very close to the same location to read the
track. With the higher level files using a voice coil type
of actuator, a feedback mechanism must be provided to locate
and stably hold the head on a given track. Typically, track
accessing and track following is provided utilizing a
magnetically written pattern in the DASD unit. A dedicated
servo system employs one surface of one of the disks in the
DASD on which to have all the tracking and access
information. A sector servo system uses small portions of
tracks between each or between several sectors on each track
of each data surface to provide the tracking and access information.
A hybrid servo system uses both to obtain
advantages of each type of servo.The degree of tracking accuracy, i.e., the ability of the
actuator servo to keep the head position discretely over the 
track, is governed by two factors. One factor is spacial
(space), the other is temporal (time). The spacial factor
corresponds to the number of servo sectors N around the
track, which is a function of the linear recording density
and the fixed block data format. The temporal factor
corresponds to the time between servo sectors or the sampling
period, which is controlled by the rotational disk velocity
(RPM).Track misregistration (TMR) error can be separated into two
major components, repeatable or synchronous with disk
rotation and non-repeatable or asynchronous with disk
rotation. The repeatable TMR component, which can be large
in case of a disk slip, can be reduced by correction
compensation. A correction for radial track misregistration
(TMR) versus radius is required for a DASD with a rotary
actuator when tracks are written approximately uniformly on
the rotary arc rather than in the radial
