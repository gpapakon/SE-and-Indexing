<ABSTRACT>
Clocked converter having a control loop (9) for regulating the output voltage (U2) by means secondary current control and having an optocoupler (21, 2). In order to be able to connect a desired value voltage divider (4, 5) to an extremely constant constant-voltage source (11) which cannot be loaded very much, a field effect transistor (3) is arranged between the optocoupler (21, 2) and a comparator (10) of the control loop (9), the gate electrode of which transistor is connected to the collector of the optocoupler phototransistor (2). The converter can be used, in particular, for the purpose of power supply in devices employed in electrical telecommunications (message transmission) technology.
