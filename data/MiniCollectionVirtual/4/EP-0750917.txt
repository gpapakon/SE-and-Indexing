<ABSTRACT>
A safety cover (20) which securably and reliably 
locks the tip (116) of a cannula (18) 

in an interior chamber (104) within 
the safety cover. The cover comprises an elongate body (101) 

having the interior chamber and an axial through hole (100) 
which extends along the entire length of the body, 

through the interior chamber and through which the 
cannula is slidably received. Displacing elements (108,110) are 

positioned within the interior chamber, each of which 
includes a hole (112) for receiving said cannula therethrough, 

and which displaces upon retraction of the tip of said 
cannula, thereby preventing subsequent advancement of 

said cannula tip. In a first embodiment the displacing 
elements are annular rings (108,110). In a second embodiment, the 

elements are rigid balls (120,122) 
having through holes (124,126). In a 

third embodiment, the displacing elements are a pair of 
conical elements (210,212), one of which is spring biased, each of 

which includes an offset hole (214,216). In each embodiment, it 
is preferable that the cannula should include a 

thickened rib (116) adjacent to said tip, and the safety cover 
should correspondingly include an annular section (14) in the 

rear portion thereof. The through hole extending 
through the rear portion has a diameter which is smaller 

than said thickened rib of said cannula whereby the 
cannula tip may not be retracted from the safety cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
stick prevention apparatus for protecting medical
personnel from injury. More particularly, the present
invention relates to tip covering elements having
internal elements which prevent a retracted needle from
reinserting therethrough.Medical care of individuals in hospitals,
clinics, and other health care facilities often includes
the taking of blood samples, intravenous supplying of
medication, and the introduction or removal of other
fluids via cannulae, needles, or syringes. The present
medical environment, in which there exist diseases, for
example Acquired-Immune Deficiency Syndrome, AIDS, for
which there are no cures, and which are transmitted via
blood to blood contact, has raised concerns relating to
the potential for contaminated "needle sticks".A wide variety of devices have been provided
in the prior art for prevention against accidental
contaminated "needle sticks". For example, U.S. Patent
No. 5,215,528 to Purdy et al. (hereinafter Purdy)
teaches an assembly for introducing a catheter into a
blood vessel, wherein there is provided a tip cover.
The tip cover of the Purdy device is provided with an
elastically deforming L-shaped member which remains in a
deformed state until the cannula is drawn back into the 
cover. Once retracted, the L-shaped member springs into
a position to prevent reemergence of the needle. Manual
repositioning of the L-shaped member is necessary to
permit the cannula to reemerge from the coverU.S. Patent 4,826,490 to Byrne et al.
(hereinafter Byrne) teaches a safety cover and syringe
assembly wherein an external cylindrical sleeve, through
which the cannula extends, is slidably mounted to a
track on the external surface of the syringe. Sliding
the external cylindrical sleeve relative to the cannula
and the syringe, such that the cannula is fully
retracted into the sleeve, causes a locking mechanism to
engage between the syringe and the sleeve so that the
cannula may not be advanced out of the sleeve without
disengagement of the locking elements by a user.U.S. Patent 5,127,905 to Lemieux teaches a
protection cap, which is similar to the device disclosed
by Purdy, as described above. In the Lemieux device an
externally mounted rotating L-shaped lever is disposed
along the axis of the cover, manual actuation of which
by a user once the cannula is retracted prevents the
cannula from reemerging from the cover. Manual
retraction of the external L-shaped lever from the path
of the cannula permits the cannula to reemerge.The above

<CLAIMS>
A cannula safety assembly, comprising:

an elongate cannula (18) having a tip and a shaft; and
a safety cover (20) mounted thereon, the safety cover (20) being for locking the tip
of the cannula (18) therein, a safety cover (20) comprising:


an elongate body (101) having an interior chamber (104), said elongate body (101)
being slidably mountable on said cannula (18);
a through hole (100), extending along the entire axial length of the elongate body
(101), from a forward portion (102) of the body (101), through said interior chamber (104)

and through a rearward portion (106) of said body (101), said cannula (18) being slidable
therethrough; and
two elements (108, 110; 120, 122; 210, 212), disposed in said interior chamber
(104) each having a hole (112, 114; 124, 126; 214, 216) for receiving said cannula (18)

therethrough, and which displace upon retraction of the tip of said cannula (18) such that
subsequent readvancement of said cannula tip through a forward portion (102) of said

safety cover (20) is prevented;
characterised in that
 the cannula (18) further comprises a thickened section (118) adjacent
to said tip, the through hole (105) extending through said rearward portion (106) having a

diameter which is smaller than the diameter of said thickened section (118) of said cannula
(18) whereby the tip of the cannula (18) may not be retracted from said elongate body

(101).
The cannula safety assembly of claim 1, wherein said elements are orientationally
randomisable and are orientationally randomised by retraction of the tip of said cannula

(18).
The cannula safety assembly of claim 1 or claim 2, which comprises a pair of said
elements.
The cannula safety assembly of claim 3, wherein at least one of said pair of
elements is spring biased such that retraction of the tip of said cannula (18) causes the pair

to displace relative to one another. 
The cannula safety assembly of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said elements
comprise a plurality of annular rings (108,110).
The cannula safety assembly of claim 5, wherein each of said plurality of annular
rings (108, 110) has a different outer diameter.
The cannula safety assembly of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said elements
comprise a plurality of rigid spheres (120,122) having through holes (124, 126).
The cannula safety assembly of any one of claims I to 4, wherein said elements
comprise conical elements (210, 212) each having an offset through hole (214, 216)

therein.
The cannula safety assembly of claim 8, wherein there is a pair of conical elements
(210, 212) and a first one (210) of said pair of conical elements (210, 212) is spring biased

within said interior chamber (104), whereby retraction of said cannula (18) permits said
first one (210) of said pair to fully nest within the other (212) of said pair, therein

misaligning said offset through holes (214, 216) and preventing subsequent readvancement
of said cannula tip through
 said forward portion (102) of said safety cover (20).
