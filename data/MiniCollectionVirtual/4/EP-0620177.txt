<ABSTRACT>
The end block has, from the outside inward, a first 
frontal perimetric supporting rim (9); a truncated 

conical shoulder (10); a second supporting rim (12) with 
a curved profile forming a collar (14); a deep annular 

groove (16); and an inner wall (16B) of said groove (16) 
with a flared profile. It may be used with tubes of 

various types.

<DESCRIPTION>
At the present time, spinning machines have 
limitations in the use of the various types of tubes 
required by users, according to the equipment in which 
the yarns are to be treated after winding into reels on 
the tubes. This constitutes a serious disadvantage which 
is eliminated by using the present end block, with which 
may also be associated a particular type of tube 
described in another simultaneous patent held by the 
holder of the present patent. Essentially, the end block in question may form 
the centering part for tubes of different shapes used for 
dyeing and other processes, these tubes being either 
cardboard tubes for finished yarn intended for direct use 
or special resin tubes, to make the use of the spinning 
machines highly flexible. Essentially, the end block according to the 
invention has, from the outside inward: 
a first frontal perimetric supporting rim; a truncated conical shoulder; a second supporting rim, which may have a curved 
profile, forming a collar; a deep annular groove; and an inner wall of said groove with a flared profile. This configuration provides an end block usable 
with a plurality of tubes within the limits of tolerance 
of spinning machines. The drawing shows in detail the end block 
according to the invention, the base disk for which the 
piece in question forms the end block, and the different 
uses with various types of tube. In the drawing, 
Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show the end block in diametral 
section and in views along II-II and III-III in Fig. 1;  Figs. 4, 5, and 6 show, in a similar way to Figs. 
1, 2, and 3, the base disk which can be used for the 
various applications in diametral section and in views 
along V-V and VI-VI in Fig. 4 respectively; Fig. 7 is an exploded view of the two disks shown 
in the preceding figures and a particular type of tube 
which can be used with them, in partial schematic axial 
section; Fig. 8 is a view of said tube from line VIII-VIII 
in Fig. 7; Figs. 9 and 10 show the use of the disks shown in 
Figs. 1 to 6 with further different types of tubes; and Fig. 11 shows an equivalent form of end block. As shown in Figs. 1 to 3, an end block is 
provided having on its outer face a central projection 3 
and an annular rim 5 at a limited distance from the 
periphery of the disk, together with an intermediate 
annular depression 7 which surrounds the central 
projection 3. The configuration of the outer face may 
also be different and is dependent on the type of 
machine. On the lower face, which is to come into contact

<CLAIMS>
1) An end block with a special profile for centering 
synthetic resin tubes of different configurations used 

for yarn dyeing and other processes, and for centering 
card tubes for finished yarn intended for direct use, 

comprising, from the outside inward, a first frontal 
perimetric supporting rim (9); a truncated conical 

shoulder (10); a second supporting rim (12) forming a 
collar (14); a deep annular groove (16); and an inner 

wall (16B) of said groove (16) with a flared profile; 
said end block being consequently usable with a plurality 

of types of tube within the axial tolerances of spinning 
machines. 
2) The disk as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
second supporting rim (12) has a curved profile.
