Arrangement for measuring the torque in a toothed 
gearing for transmitting a rotational movement, in which 

at least three intermeshing helically toothed spur wheels 
(1, 2, 3; 26, 27, 29) having parallel axes (5, 6, 7) are 

provided in the toothed gearing, characterized in that, 
on at least one of the gearwheels (1, 2, 3; 26, 27), at 

least one distance sensor (15, 16, 17, 18; 30, 32) is 
directed onto a plane face (30, 31) of this gearwheel 

(1, 2, 3; 26, 27), the distance sensor (15, 16, 17, 18; 
30, 32) being installed fixedly relative to the frame and 

being connected to an evaluation circuit (36). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that two pairs of distance sensors (15, 16, 17, 18) 

are installed, each pair being arranged in a plane 
perpendicular to the parallel axes (5, 6, 7), on a 

diameter in proximity to the root diameter. 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 

in that the distance sensors (15, 16) of the first pair 
are arranged in each case on a straight line (19, 20) 

which is perpendicular to the parallel axes (5, 6, 7) and 
which runs through the piercing points of the axes 

(5, 6, 7) of the gearwheel (2) and of the respective 
adjacent gearwheel (1, 3) relative to the said plane, and 
in that the distance sensors (17, 18) of the second 
pair are arranged on a straight line (21) which is 

perpendicular to the parallel axes (5, 6, 7) and which 
runs through the piercing point of the axes (6) of the 

gearwheel (2) relative to the said plane and forms the 
axis of symmetry (21) for the first pair. 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that a further distance sensor (24) is assigned to 

each distance sensor (23) diametrically to the gearwheel 
(2) in an equivalent position, the further distance 

sensors (24) likewise being connected to the evaluation 
circuit (36). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the evaluation circuit (36) is connected to a 

regulating device (37) for a multi-motor drive.
