<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of fine ceramic pressing granulate by fluidised-bed drying, with the granulate produced being suitable for subsequent shaping by pressing. This is achieved according to the invention by there being added to the fine ceramic slip, for fluidisation, appropriate fluidisers and, as binders and pressing aids, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylacetate (PVAC) and polysaccharide/acrylic acid (PS/AC) in amounts of from 0.4 to 1.5% by mass, based on the dry solids content of the slip, in the ratio PVA : PVAC : PS/AC = (40 +/- 20) : (50 +/- 25) : (10 +/- 10) % in such a way that the slip has a moisture content of (38 +/- 3) % and a density of (1600 +/- 50) g/l and that the inlet air temperature of the heat transfer medium to the fluidised-bed drying of fine ceramic pressing granulate is from 180 to 250@C and the outlet air temperature is from 40 to 100@C.

A process for the production of fine ceramic pressing 
granulate by fluidized-bed drying, wherein 

liquefacients, binding additives and pressing additives 
are added to the slip and hot air or smoke gas is 

supplied to the fluidized-bed chamber from below as 
heat carrier and to maintain the fluidized bed, 

characterized by adding to the fine ceramic slip 
liquefacients and as binding additives and pressing 

additives polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl acetate 
(PVAC) and polysaccharide/acrylic acid (PS/AC) in the 

amounts of 0.4 to 1.5 weight percent, related to the 
proportion of dry material of the slip, in the ratio of 

PVA : PVAC : PS/AC = (40 ± 20) : (50 ± 25) : (10 ± 10) 
% in such a way that the slip possesses a moisture of 

(38 ± 3) % and a density of (1600 ± 50) g/l, and by the 
incoming air temperature of the heat carrier for the 

fluidized-bed drying of fine ceramic pressing granulate 
being 180 to 250 °C and the outgoing air temperature 

being 40 to 100 °C.
