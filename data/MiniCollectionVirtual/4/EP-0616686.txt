<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-HYDROGENOUS PROCESS LEVEL MEASUREMENT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the measurement of levels, phase, interfaces, and density of substantially non-hydrogenous process materials using neutron bac scattering for measurements.The use of thermal neutron backscatter, thermal neutron transmission, fast neutron transmission, and various gamma radiation techniques for process measurements have long been known. For example, the assignee of the present application, Kay-Ray Sensall Inc., of Mount Prospect, Illinois, has level and interface measurement systems using radiation sources in detection, such as their Model 4800X Level System, the Model 4760 Level' System, the Model 4160 Neutron Level/Interface Measurement System, and the Model 3660 Density Measurement System. These systems use radiation principles, having sources of radiation and detectors, which provide an output indicating a level of process material. The detection circuitry senses the output and uses it for control of a process, for example, with microprocessor control and two or four wire transmitter systems.Fast or high energy neutron sources are known, and are used in measurement systems, such as in moisture detectors and interface level measurements. Fast neutrons may be converted to thermal neutrons when they travel in certain materials, especially hydrogen containing materials. Detection of either backscattered or transmitted thermal neutrons is the basis of such measurements. Thermal neutron detection systems are readily and inexpensively applied to hydrogenous process measurements. These detection systems are extremely 

 limited in their detection of neutron energies above the thermal or epithermal range. The detection probability of these detection systems at above epithermal energies is only 1/100 of a percent of the capture probability at the thermal energies.A system that uses direct measurement of the quantity of transmitted high energy or fast neutrons is the assignees Model 4360 Neutron Transmission System, the principles of which are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,794,256, titled FAST NEUTRON PROCESS MEASUREMENT SYSTEM.The apparatus of the present invention detects backscattered neutrons having above epithermal energy, as opposed to measuring transmission of neutrons. A greatly reduced neutron source size can also be used in the present invention since the neutrons need not be transmitted through the entire vessel filled with the process material.The present system measures density, level and interfaces

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A fast neutron detection system for accurate measurement of parameters of substantially non- hydrogenous material contained in a walled vessel comprising: a fast neutron source directing fast neutrons in a first direction from an exterior of the vessel through the vessel wall to the material; a detector system mounted adjacent to the neutron source to provide detection of neutrons scattered back from the material through the vessel wall in a direction substantially opposite from the first direction; and an energy degradation shield disposed between the source and the vessel wall, to reduce the energy of the fast neutrons.
2. The system as specified in claim 1 wherein the energy degradation shield comprises plastic material.
3. The system as specified in claim 1 further including means for positioning the shield so that the neutrons directed from the source to the material pass through the energy degradation shield, and the neutrons scattered back from the material to the detector system avoid the energy degradation shield.
4. The system as specified in claim 1 wherein the backscattered neutrons pass through the energy degradation shield and the neutrons directed from the source to the material avoid the energy degradation shield. 


 5. The system as specified as in claim 1 wherein both the source neutrons and the backscattered neutrons pass through the energy degradation shield.
6. The system as specified in claim 1 wherein the detection system comprises a pair of chambers with large surface areas and wherein the neutron source is disposed between the detection chambers.
7. A method of determining characteristics of a substantially non-hydrogenous material located in a walled vessel comprising the steps of: directing high energy neutrons from a source located outside the walled vessel to the material; detecting the neutrons scattered back toward the source; providing an energy degradation sequence between the source and the detectors to reduce the energy levels of the neutrons to a desired range.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the vessel walls have a maximum thickness of four inches of steel materials.
9. The method of claim 7 including the step of providing the energy degradation sequence in three stages including providing a controlled mean neutron energy reduction through elastic collisions with hydrogen and high energy neutrons, causing collisions of high energy neutrons with the substantially non- hydrogenous material, and causing a controlled number of collisions with hydrogen and low energy neutrons.
10. A fast neutron backscatter detection system for accurate measurement of characteristics of 


substantially non-hydrogenous material contained in a walled vessel comprising: a fast neutron source disposed between multiple ion detection chambers; and an energy degradation shield positioned between the vessel wall and the neutron source and between the vessel wall and the detection chambers such that neutrons emitted from the source pass through the shield, and backscattered neutrons pass through the shield before being intercepted by the detection chambers.
