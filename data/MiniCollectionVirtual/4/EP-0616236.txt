<ABSTRACT>
A locking device ensures that a plug part (1) is held with high tensile strength in a socket part (3). The locking device has at least one detent pawl (5) which can be locked behind a detent element (6) when the plug part is completely inserted. For releasing the lock, an unlocking lever (7) is provided next to the detent element (6), by means of which the detent pawl can be released from the detent element. This unlocking lever is constructed as a double lever which is pivotably mounted on the plug part. As a result, no excessively high tensile forces have to be exerted on the socket part to remove the plug part.

A plug connection for an optical fibre comprising a plug member 
(1) which has at least one plug pin (2), and a socket member (3) which 

has at least one socket (4) for receiving the plug pin, wherein for 
securing the plug member when inserted in the socket member there is 

provided a latch device which has at least one resilient locking pawl (5) 
which is arranged on the socket member and which can be latched behind a 

locking element (6) when the plug member is entirely inserted, wherein 
arranged beside the locking element (6) is a release lever (7) with which 

the locking pawl (5) is disengageable, characterised in that the release 
lever is a double lever mounted pivotably on the plug member and 

comprising a grip portion (8) and a pivot arm (9) extending to the 
locking element (6). 
A plug connection according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
release lever (7) has a pair of pivot projections (10) which can be 

latched into a mounting fork (11) on the plug member. 
A plug connection according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
plug member has a plug housing (12) and that the locking element and the 

mounting fork are formed integrally with the plug housing. 
A plug connection according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the socket member (3) has an inner socket housing 

(13) and that the locking pawl (5) is arranged on a resilient tongue (15) 
which is formed integrally with the inner socket housing. 
A plug connection according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the release lever (7) has a code portion (16) with 

a coding comprising projections and recesses, and that the code portion 
engages into a securing portion (17) on the socket member with a  

 
corresponding coding, wherein the code portion and the securing portion 

are so arranged that the locking pawl (5) is engageable only when the 
coding coincides. 
A plug connection according to claim 4 and claim 5 characterised 
in that the inner socket housing (13) is inserted into an outer socket 

housing (14), that the inner socket housing is secured in the outer 
socket housing by an end portion (20) which is fixed to one of the socket 

housings (13, 14), and that said end portion is provided with the 
securing portion (17). 
A plug connection according to claim 6 characterised in that the 
end portion is a push-on frame (20) which can be fitted onto the inner 

socket housing (13). 
A plug connection according to one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that the socket member (3) is in the form of a central 

member in such a way that a plug member can be inserted from both sides 
and that a respective locking pawl is arranged in the socket member for 

each plug member.
