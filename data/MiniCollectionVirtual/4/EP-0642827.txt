<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst for purifying an exhaust gas or a
waste gas containing nitrogen oxides (hereinafter referred to as "NO x "), carbon
monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (hereinafter referred to as "HC").The treatment of exhaust gases of automobiles, etc. is generally carried
out by a catalyst of noble metal type, for example, a catalytic system of a
noble metal supported on alumina utilizing CO and HC in the exhaust gas, but
NOx is purified only in a very narrow range in the vicinity of the stoichiometric
air-fuel ratio. Of late, a requirement for lowering the fuel cost of
a car becomes stronger with the increase of the global environmental problems
and such a lean burn engine that combustion is effected with at least the
stoichiometric air-fuel ratio has been watched with keen interest as a key
technology. Considering the running property or accelerating property of a
car, however, an engine operating in only the lean zone meets with many inconvenient
points and it is really necessary to effect the combustion in both
the vicinity of the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio and the lean zone. As to
the purification of NOx in the lean zone, a crystalline silicate catalyst containing
cobalt or copper has lately been spotlighted as a catalyst having a high
performance.These catalysts have sufficient catalytic functions at the initial reaction
period, but have some problems in durability. Thus, various crystalline
silicates have been researched and examined so as to improve the durability.
For example, there have been proposed methods of using new silicates, in which
Group VIII elements of Periodic Table or rare earth elements are incorporated in
the crystalline lattice (Japanes Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 165816/1991)
and in which alkaline earth metals are added (Japanese Patent Application No.
319195/1991) in order to prevent release of aluminum as the main constitutional 
element of the crystalline silicate and to stabilize cobalt or copper. Furthermore,
in order to prevent entrance of steam capable of accelerating release of
aluminum, it has been studied to apply a crystalline silicate on the surface of
which hydrophobic silicalite crystals are grown to improve the steam resistance
(Japanese Patent Application No. 192829/1991).However, the use of these catalysts results in that the durability is
largely improved in the lean atmosphere, but in the case of accelerating, the
gas temperature is instantaneously increased, during which the gas composition
becomes a rich atmosphere in which a
