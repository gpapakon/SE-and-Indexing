<ABSTRACT>
Activated carboxylic acids and esters such as pentafluorobenzoic acid 
are rapidly decarboxylated in high yields by reacting the acid or ester with an 

alkanolamine reagent which catalyzes the reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the decarboxylation of carboxylic
acids and more particularly to a process for the decarboxylation of activated
carboxylic acids and esters, such as pentafluorobenzoic acid, using an alkanolamine
reagent to catalyze the reaction.Activated carboxylic acids, such as pentafluorobenzoic acid or tetrafluorophthalic
acid, can be thermally decarboxylated by heating at a temperature of
340°C, as is reported by P. Sartoni et al. in Chem. Ber.100, 3016-3023 (1967).
They can also be decarboxylated by heating the acid in the presence of a base, such as
aqueous NH3 (see J. Burdon et al. J. Chem.Soc., 6336-6342 (1965)) or a non-polycyclic
organic base, such as [Me(CH2)7]3N (see Niizeki et al. Chem.Ab., Vol
111, 96836m, 702 (1989)). Such processes either proceed slowly and/or give
products in low yields. Maximum yields, in any event, are about 70 mole %. British
Patent Application 2,122,190 discloses the decarboxylation of halogenated benzoic
acids and esters using a solvent and, preferably, a polar, aprotic solvent.A decarboxylation process has now been discovered which is rapid,
provides high yields, and can be conducted with a reduced amount of catalytic reagent
and at relatively low temperatures.In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for the
decarboxylation of an activated aryl carboxylic acid or ester, said process comprising
reacting said acid or ester with an alkanolamine reagent so as to remove the carboxylic
acid or ester group from said acid andreplacing said aryl carboxylic acid or ester group with hydrogen,wherein said activated aryl carboxylic acid or ester is an carboxylic acid or ester which
contains one or more electron withdrawing moieties selected from halogen, NR3+, CF3,
NO2 COOR, COR, SO3-, and CN, where R is H, or an alkyl or aryl group having up
to about 30 carbon atoms, andwherein the alkanolamine reagent is selected from ethanolamine, diethanolamine, 2amino-2-hydroxylmethyl-1,3-propandiol,
2-amino-2-methylpropanol, 2-amino-1,3-propandiol,
and 3-amino-1-propanol.By "activated carboxylic arylic acid or ester" is meant that the acid or ester
contains one or more electron withdrawing moieties (i.e. an atom or group) but which  
will not undergo any significant side reactions with the alkanolamine reagent. Non-limiting
examples of such electron withdrawing moieties include halogen, NR3+, CF3,
NO2, COOR, COR, SO3-, CN and the like, where R is H, or an alkyl or aryl group
having up to about 30 carbon atoms. For the activation of the aryl

present in the reaction mixture in molar excess to said carboxylic acid or ester.
The process of claim 2 wherein the mole ratio of said alkanolamine
reagent to said carboxylic acid or ester is from about 1.05 to 3.
The process of claim 1 wherein said carboxylic acid or ester is
continuously or incrementally added to said alkanolamine reagent over a period of

time, such that said alkanolamine reagent remains in molar excess to said carboxylic
acid or ester, and the decarboxylated product and carbon dioxide are continuously

removed as vapor from the reaction mixture.

about 80° to 130°C.
The process of claim 1 wherein the reaction temperature is from
about 50° to 200°C.

continuously or incrementally, to the alkanolamine reagent in liquid form over a
period of time.
The process of claim 8 wherein said aryl carboxylic acid is
pentafluorobenzoic acid, and said alkanolamine reagent is diethanolamine.
