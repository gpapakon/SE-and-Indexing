<DESCRIPTION>
 TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING A COMBINATION OF CAL¬ CIUM ANTAGONISTS WITH KNOWN ANTIGLAUCOMA AGENTSBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the field of ophthalmology. In particular, the invention relates to the treatment of glaucoma using a combination of a compound which lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) and a calcium channel antagonist to prevent or reduce the loss of visual field.Although the underlying causes of glaucoma are not understood at this time, glaucoma is characterized by damage to the optic nerve, accompanied by a decrease in the normal visual field. One early warning sign of possible glaucomatous visual field loss is elevated IOP. In fact, glaucoma has historically been treated by medically and/or surgically lowering elevated IOP. However, elevated IOP does not always result in the occurrence of visual field loss; moreover, visual field loss may occur at levels of IOP which are considered within the normal range. Thus, factors other than IOP play a role in determining the occurrence of visual field. loss. Microcirculatory disturbances which restrict nutritive blood flow to the choroid, retina and optic nerve fibers are undoubtedly also involved.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides compositions useful in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The compositions contain a combination of at least one calcium channel antagonist and at least one compound which lowers IOP. The combination is effective in reducing or preventing visual field loss, as well as reducing IOP to normal levels. Further, the reduction of IOP provides both the patient and the physician with an easy means of tracking a patient's progress. 

 ln an alternate embodiment of the compositions of the present invention, the above combination may further include an anionic mucomimetic polymer, a gelling polysaccharide, a finely divided drug carrier substrate (defined below), or a combination of these components. These additional components provide compositions which are comfortable and have sustained release.Detailed Peggrjptipn of the InveηtjpnTo remain healthy and function normally, the retina and the optic nerve fibers (neurons) must receive a proper supply of nutrients and oxygen and must have their metabolic waste products and carbon dioxide removed. This is accomplished by the microcirculation of these tissues. As used herein, the term"microcirculation" refers to the blood flow through the nutritive blood vessels, across whose walls nutrients, gases
