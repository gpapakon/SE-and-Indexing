<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a clamping device (S) with a rotationally symmetric basic body (G), in which a cylinder bore (Z) for an alternatively rotatable clamping sleeve (H) is provided parallel to and eccentrically to its axis (1), an alternatively operable radial clamping means (A), and a positive-locking, releasable rotary positioning means (P) for the clamping sleeve. The clamping sleeve (H) has a cylindrical outer circumference (13) and an eccentric, cylindrical location bore (14), parallel to the cylinder axis (6) of the outer circumference (13), for an approximately cylindrical shank of a tool or a workpiece. In this clamping device (S), the clamping sleeve (H) bears with its outer circumference (13) directly against the inner wall (5) of the cylinder bore (Z), the radial clamping means (A) is of mechanical design and is provided in the basic body (G), and the rotary positioning means (P) is formed at least from a peripheral tooth system (23) on the clamping sleeve (H) and a mating tooth system or an axial pin of the basic body (G). The mating tooth system or the axial pin can be brought into engagement with the peripheral tooth system (23).

symmetrical basic body (G) in which a cylindrical bore 

(Z) is provided in parallel and eccentrically relative to 

its axis (1) for a selectively rotatable clamping sleeve 
(H) which has a cylindrical outer casing (13) and a 

cylindrical receiving bore (14), which is parallel and 
eccentric to the cylinder axis (6) of the outer casing 

(13), for an approximately cylindrical shank of a tool or 
a workpiece, having a selectively actuable radial clamping 

device (A) for the clamping sleeve (H), and having a 
positive-locking, releasable rotary-positioning device 

(P) between the basic body (G) and the clamping sleeve 
(H), characterized in that the clamping sleeve (H) bears 

with its outer casing (13) directly against the inner 
wall (5) of the cylindrical bore (Z), in that the radial 

clamping device (A) of the clamping sleeve (H) is of 
mechanical design and is provided in the basic body (G) 

with an access to the cylindrical bore (Z), and in that 
the rotary-positioning device (P) has at least one 

peripheral toothing (23) on the clamping sleeve (H), into 
which toothing either a counter-toothing (10) or an axial 

pin of the basic body (G) can be brought into engagement. 
Clamping element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the dimensions of the eccentricities of the 

receiving bore (14) and of the cylindrical bore (Z) are 
different, preferably in such a way that the dimension of 

the eccentricity of the receiving bore (14) corresponds 
at the least to the dimension of the eccentricity of the 

cylindrical bore (Z). 
Clamping element according to Claim 1,  
 

characterized in that the clamping sleeve (H) has a 
longitudinally extending slit (21) which passes approximately 

radially from the outer casing (13) to the receiving 
bore (14). 
Clamping element according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that a plurality of axial grooves are provided on 

the inside and/or on the outside of the clamping sleeve 
(H) in addition to the slit (21). 
Clamping element according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the clamping sleeve (H) has a 

plurality of slits which are distributed in the circumferential 
direction, run in opposite directions, and are 

bounded in the radial direction by a, preferably radial, 
bore. 
Clamping element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that at least one grub screw (20) is provided as 

a radial clamping device (A) in a threaded bore (19) 
which extends from the outer side of the basic body (G) 

right into the cylindrical bore (Z). 
Clamping element according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 3 and 5, characterized in that a circumferential 

incision (16) is provided in the outer casing (13) 
of the clamping sleeve (H), in which incision a securing 

screw (17) engages to secure the clamping sleeve (H) 
axially, said securing screw being contained in a radial 

threaded bore (18) of the basic body (G). 
Clamping element according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a securing and sealing ring (12), 

for example an O-ring, is provided in the cylindrical 
bore (Z), which ring serves to hold the clamping sleeve 

(H) axially and serves as a sealing means to counter the 
escape of coolant or the entry of dirt. 
Clamping element according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 3, 5 and 7, characterized in that the clamping
