<ABSTRACT>
The chronographic watch comprises first timekeeping displays (H, M, S1) used to indicate the time of day and second chronograph displays (h, m, S2) used to indicate a time interval in response to a control device (P1, P2) with the aid of which the chronograph can be set going, stopped and then reset. The chronographic watch includes means of instantaneous conversion of at least one of the said second displays (here the seconds counter S2) into a display of another function, for example the calendar display (Q) when the chronograph is not used. In this example, provision is also made for transforming the minute counter (m) into a four-year cycle display (BISS) and the hour counter (h) into a month display (Mo).

Chronograph watch comprising time keeping 
indicator means (H, M, S2) used for displaying the time of 

day and analog chronograph indicator means comprising 
chronograph hands (h. m, S1) which are normally used for 

displaying a time interval in response to a manual control 
arrangement (P1, P2) with the aid of which the chronograph 

can be started, stopped, then reset to zero, characterized 
by the fact that it includes instantaneous conversion 

means for systematically and automatically converting at 
least one of said hands of the chronograph indicator means 

(h, m, S2) into an indicator of a function other than the 
chronograph function whenever the chronograph is not in 

use. 
Chronograph watch according to claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the chronograph indicator means 

comprise at least a first and a second chronograph small 
hands (m, h) for counting minutes and hours, respectively, 

one of these chronograph small hands being driven by the 
instantaneous conversion means for constituting said 

indicator of a function other than the chronograph 
function whenever the chronograph is not in use. 
Chronograph watch according to claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that said first chronograph small hand 

(m) which normally counts minutes indicates the date 
whenever the chronograph is not in use. 
Chronograph watch according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized by the fact that said second chronograph 

small hand (h) which normally counts hours indicates the 
month (mo) whenever the chronograph is not in use. 
Chronograph watch according to claims 3 and 4, 
characterized by the fact that it includes first (71) and 

second (70) memories adapted to memorize respectively the  
 

date (Q) and the month (Mo) when the chonorgraph is 
started then stopped, the contents of said first and 

second small hands, respectively, when the chronograph is 
reset to zero. 
Chronograph watch according to claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the chronograph indicator means 

comprise at least a chronograph large hand (S2) for 
counting seconds, this chronograph large hand being driven 

by the instantaneous conversion means for constituting 
said indicator of a function other than the chronograph 

function whenever the chronograph is not in use. 
Chronograph watch according to claim 6, characterized 
by the fact that the other function displayed by 

the chronograph large hand is the date. 
Chronograph watch according to claim 7, characterized 
by the fact that the chronograph indicator means 

further comprise a first small hand (m) which normally 
counts minutes and indicates the four-year leap year cycle 

(BISS) whenever the chronograph is not in use, and a 
second small hand (h) which normally counts hours and 

indicates the month (Mo) also whenever the chronograph is 
not in use. 
Chronograph watch according to claim 8, characterized 
by the fact that it includes first (71), second 

(69) and third (70) memories adapted to memorise, 
respectively, the date (Q), the four-year cycle (BISS) and 

the month (Mo) when the chronograph is started then 
stopped, the content of said first, second and third 

memory being displayed, respectively, by said large hand 
and said first and second small hands when the chronograph 

is reset to zero.  
 
Chronograph watch according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized by the fact that 
the
 time 
keeping indicator means comprise at least an hours hand 

(H) and a minutes hand (M). 
Chronograph watch according to claims 2, 6 and 
10, characterized by the fact the said hours (H) and 

minutes (M) hands are driven by a first motor (41) and 
that the large hand (S2), the first small hand (m) and the 

second small hand (m) are respectively driven by second 
(42), third (43) and fourth (44) motors.
