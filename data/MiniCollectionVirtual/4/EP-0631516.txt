<ABSTRACT>
The fire fighting and hot surface cooling methods of this invention use a composition formed by combining a nonionic surfactant possessing a specific photoexcitable functional group with an arylphosphate, also of photoexcitable nature, in a solvent medium of composition and content that allows for a convenient workable viscosity and is resistant to effects of freezing. The ultimate water solution used for spraying to extinguish a fire or cool a surface contains from 2000 ppm of the surfactant nonylphenolethoxylate and 94 ppm of the arylphosphate, phenol-6-phosphate, to 3000 ppm surfactant and 141 ppm arylphosphate. A nonaqueous composition containing a mixture of different nonylphenolethoxylates to extinguish lithium type fires is also described. The spray solution is applied to the fire until the desired result occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "CHEMICALFIREEXTINGUISHINGANDSURFACECOOLING COMPOSITIONS A METHODS OFUSING"This is a continuati'on-in-part of the pending application Serial Number 07/775,288 filed October 11, 199 5 Field of the InventionThe invention proposes a new approach to understandin th# working of chemical formulations to increase radically their effectiveness when sprayed by conventional fire- fighting equipment to extinguish fires, even when well- 10 fueled, and to cool rapidly surfaces of structures that ha been heated by such fires to very elevated temperatures. Oil-well fires and their associated structures provide classic examples of a field of use for such formulations. The formulations are also effective against lithium type 15 fires. The new approach referred to is to have the solute specially compounded to increase its fire and heat control effects through providing photo-excitable molecules. The fire is sprayed with the formulation until the desired result of cooling a hot surface or extinguishing a fire is .0 obtained.Background of the Invention The direct background of the present invention is -foun in two prior art patents to Conklin and Mowry, U.S. 4398605 and 4476687. The first is entitled "Fire ExtinguishingV 5 Composition and Method"; the second, "Cooling MetalSurfaces." Their stated objectives are those of the presen invention: "* * * a fire-fighting liquid that extinguishes 

 a fire quickly and, in particular, coolfs] the fire so that the high heat generated is rapidly reduced." ('605 patent, col. 1, lines 45-48) ; * * * the provision of a heated surface cooling solution and method for cooling metal surface particularly structural steel elements of a petroleum rig." ('687 patent, col. l, line 67 to col. 2, line 2) .These two patents contain a clear discussion of the prior art relevant to their patentability which is here intended to be incorporated by re erence, i.e.: Ding an US 3541010; Nieneker US 3578590; Francen US 3772195; Adell US 3912647;Falk US 4090967.Practice of the present invention achieves a dramatic improvement over the results that can actually be obtained by practicing the methods described and claimed by Conklin and Mowry in their '605 and '687 patents. This improvement can be realized to its fullest extent by utilizing two different aspects of the discoveries that underlie it. The first is in the specific novel combinations of chemical components to be used to make up the water solution concentrate which is added by the fire fighters to the water to be sprayed. The second is in the
