<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rubber support bushing for a motor vehicle, in which a rubber body (3) is arranged between an inner tube (1) and an outer tube (2) and has at least two chambers (4, 5), which are filled with a liquid damping medium and are connected to one another by at least one transfer passage with a shut-off means comprising an axially extending seal which opens only in the presence of a predetermined pressure difference in the chambers (4, 5). This seal for shutting off the transfer passage comprises at least two mutually separate sealing lips (8) which have, in cross-section, a hook-shaped profile with a radial undercut (9) and can be deformed radially relative to the centre line of the rubber support bushing.

<CLAIMS>
Rubber sleeve spring for mountings in a motor 
vehicle, in which a rubber body is disposed 

between an inner tube and an outer tube, and at 
least two chambers filled with a liquid damping 

medium are provided, which chambers are connected 
together via an overflow channel with a shutoff 

device which only opens when there is a 
predetermined pressure difference in the chambers 

and consists of an axially extending seal which is 
moulded onto the rubber body in one piece, 

characterised in that the seal of the shutoff 
device of the overflow channel consists of at 

least two sealing lips (8) which are separate from 
one another, have a hook profile with a radial 

undercut in cross section and can be deformed 
radially with respect to the centre axis of the 

rubber sleeve spring. 
Rubber sleeve spring according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the system is formed in 

conjunction with a constantly open throttle 
channel (6). 
Rubber sleeve spring according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the hook profiles of the 

sealing lips (8) point in opposite directions. 
Rubber sleeve spring according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the sealing 

lips (8) have different profiles and different 
degrees of rigidity. 
Rubber sleeve spring according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that sealing lips 

(8) are disposed in overflow channels both on the 
side of the throttle channel (6) and on the side 

lying diametrically opposite this side.
