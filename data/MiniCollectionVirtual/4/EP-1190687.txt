<ABSTRACT>
The impactor for fitting a spherical head on the shaft of a hip replacement joint comprises a tubular casing (2) containing a weight (3) mounted on an axial shaft (9). When this is raised it compresses a spring (4) at the top of the sleeve and can be locked in place by a catch (6) which swivels into a groove (5) in the weight. When the catch is released the weight falls and strikes a socket (11) at the base of the tube.

<CLAIMS>
Impactor intended to produce a percussion on an
orthopaedic element to be attached to another, in

particular a spherical head to be attached to a
femoral stem, by way of a Morse cone formed on

each side of said elements, which impactor
consists of a sleeve (2) in which a weight (3) is

mounted slidably, which weight (3) is able to act
with compression on a spring (4) by way of

automatic release means (5), 
characterized in that

the release means (5) consist of a catch (6)
mounted with tilting on an eccentric hinge pin (7)

which is mounted integrally on the walls of a seat
(8) of the weight (3) in which it is lodged, an

axial tie rod (9) passing freely through a bore
(10) of the weight (3) but being able to be made

integral with the latter by the catch (6) so as to
be driven towards the striker spring (4) arranged

between one end (2a) of the sleeve (2) and the
weight (3), in such a way as to compress it as far

as a release value at which the catch (6) tilts
and frees the weight (3) relative to the tie rod

(9), this weight then being projected with force,
in a direction counter to that of compression of

the spring (4), in order to strike an impaction
endpiece (11) which passes freely through the

other end (2b) of the sleeve (2) remote from the
spring (4) and is integral with an end (9a) of the

tie rod (9) opening out from said end (2b) of the 
sleeve (2), the operator keeping the endpiece (11)

applied against one of the elements to be joined
together.
Impactor according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the catch (6) consists of a generally
cylindrical component which is able, on the one

hand, to fit with play in the substantially
corresponding seat (8) formed at the upper part of

the weight (3) towards the striker spring (4) and
to be articulated there with tilting around the

pin (7) which is integral with said weight (3) and
extends perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of

the assembly, but offset relative to the latter,
and, on the other hand, to be traversed freely by

the tie rod (9), in the same way as the weight
(3), and with which it is possible to connect said

weight (3) and its catch (6) by way of a tooth
(12) formed at the lower part of the latter and

directed towards the longitudinal axis of the tie
rod (9) so as to cooperate by locking with a

peripheral groove (13) of the latter under the
effect of a spring (14) interposed between a wall

of the upper seat (8) of the weight (3) and the
catch (6) in line with its tooth (12), the latter

remaining locked in the groove (13) of the tie rod
(9) during a compression thrust on the striker

spring (4) exerted by the impaction endpiece (11)
integral with the tie rod (9), itself temporarily

integral with the weight (3) by way of the catch
(6) until the latter is caused to tilt about its

pin (7), effected by a thrust on the catch (6) at
its upper part diagonally opposite the tooth (12),

by way of a bearing (15) coming into contact with
an internal fixed part (16a) of a closure plug

(16) of the sleeve (2), so as to provoke the
release of the catch (6) and, consequently, of the

weight (3) which is integral with it. 
Impactor according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the closure plug (16) of the sleeve (2)
consists of an upper part (16b) in the form of a

lid screwed into a corresponding threaded part of
the sleeve (2), and of an internal part (16c)

delimiting, on the one hand, a blind axial seat
(17) permitting free clearance of the tie rod (9),

and, on the other hand, a coaxial seat (18)
between said internal part (16c) of the plug (16)

and the bore (2c) of the sleeve (2), in which
coaxial seat (2c) is arranged the striker spring

(4), between the peripheral summit (3a) of the
weight (3) and a shoulder (16d) formed by the

bottom of the part of the plug (16) forming a lid
(16b).
Impactor according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 a return spring (19), with a
force less than that of the striker spring (4), is

arranged coaxially at a lower part of the tie rod
(9) between an internal seat (20) of the impaction

endpiece (11) and an internal seat (21) of the
weight (3).
Impactor according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the sleeve (2) comprises, on
its periphery, slits (22) extending through its

wall so as to permit sterilization of the external
and internal parts of the assembly.
