<ABSTRACT>
A filter (50) is disposed internally of the fuel injector (10) between the inlet (11) and the internal valve means (26, 28) so that particulate material having an internal origin may also be prevented from reaching the injector's valve means. The filter is an electroformed screen that is supported within the fuel injector's nozzle end and is sandwiched against an internal shoulder (58) of the fuel injector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electromechanical actuated fuel injectors of the 
type used in the fuel systems of spark-ignited internal combustion engines. It is known to provide such a fuel injector with an external filter means 
disposed to filter the fuel as it approaches the fuel injector's inlet. While such a 
filter is suitable for preventing particulate material in fuel from entering the fuel 
injector, it is incapable of filtering particulate material that may originate 
internally of the fuel injector either on account of processes used to 
manufacture and assemble the fuel injector or on account of usage. The present invention relates to an improvement that enables a filter to 
be disposed internally of the fuel injector between the inlet and the internal 
valve means so that particulate material having an internal origin may also be 
prevented from reaching the valve means. Although it is known to provide certain mechanical fuel injectors with flow 
geometries intended to filter particulate material of external origin, insofar as 
the applicant is aware the issue of filtering particulate material that originates 
internally of an electromechanical actuated gasoline, or flex fuel, fuel injector 
has not been successfully addressed. Such fuel injectors are typically 
manufactured in special environments using special processes to eliminate 
sources of contamination inside the finished product. Particulate material can 
originate within such a fuel injector due to manufacturing processes and/or from 
inadequate cleaning of component parts prior to assembly. Internal particulate 
material can originate from any assembly tooling, gauging, or air borne matter 
which becomes trapped inside the fuel injector prior to assembly of the external 
filter at the fuel injector inlet. Elimination of sources of internal contamination 
has historically been controlled only through special manufacturing processes, 
special techniques, and parts inspection.  
 The present invention is not intended to eliminate the need to maintain 
certain process controls used to avoid the inclusion of particulate material in the 
finished fuel injector. The invention is, however, intended to possibly minimize 
the intensity of inspection that may be required of the fuel injector and its 
component parts during assembly and thus more efficiently satisfy 
requirements against internal contamination. Briefly, the present invention comprises in a general way the 
incorporation of an internal filter element in close proximity to the

<CLAIMS>
A fuel injector (10) comprising a fuel inlet (11) at which pressurized 
fuel is introduced into the fuel injector, a nozzle end (12) at which fuel is 

injected from the fuel injector, an internal fuel passage extending from said inlet 
to a valve seat member (18) at said nozzle end, selectively energizable and 

de-energizable electromechanical actuator means (14) for axially reciprocating 
a member (26) to unseat from and seat on a seat (28) of said seat member for 

opening and closing a hole (30) in said seat member that is circumscribed by 
said seat and thereby control the flow of fuel through the fuel passage, and filter 

means (50) disposed internally of the fuel injector within said fuel passage 
downstream of said fuel inlet and upstream of said seat for filtering particulate 

material from fuel before it reaches said seat, support means (16) providing 
downstream back-up support of said filter means, said support means and said 

filter means comprising respective central through-holes (24, 53), througn 
which said member passes, said support means comprising additional 

through-hole means (32) which is covered by said filter means and through 
which fuel passes to said seat, and said central through-hole of said support 

means having close running clearance to said member such that the size of 
said clearance imposes a substantially greater restriction to flow than the 

restriction imposed by said additional through-hole means so as to cause 
essentially all fuel flow to pass through said additional through-hole means, said 

filter means comprising an outer peripheral margin (56) that is sandwiched 
between said support means and an internal shoulder (58) at said nozzle end 

and an inner peripheral margin (54) having a downstream face that is 
supported against a corresponding inner peripheral margin of said support 

means and an upstream face opposite said downstream face characterized in 
that said upstream face of said inner peripheral margin of said filter means is 

exposed to said internal fuel passage at the location directly overlying the 
location where its downstream face is supported against said support means.

through-holes (60) each of which has an area effective to filter a certain sized 
particulate material. 
A fuel injector as set forth in claim 3 characterized further in that 
said limited area is within an annular band of said filter screen element 

containing such through-holes throughout, said annular band is radially 
inwardly bounded by said inner peripheral margin and radially outwardly

multitude of through-holes comprises through-holes each having an area
