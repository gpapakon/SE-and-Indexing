<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to coaxial cables for transmission of 
microwave signals of the type having a microwave energy conductor 
surrounded by a polymeric dielectric insulation, a conductive layer 
over the insulation, and a polymeric protective jacket for use in 
applications requiring vey low bending or torque forces. Microwave transmission cables of the type having an insulated 
microwave conductor shielded by a conductive metal foil layer 
helically wrapped around the insulation, and a protective jacket 
often tend to be more stiff and thus less bendable without damage. 
There are a number of applications, most notably involving gimbal 
mechanisms, which require a microwave cable of this type, but one 
which is less stiff or more easily bent. These gimbal mechanisms 
often have limited drive power for movement, and each element in 
the mechanism must provide the minimum resistance to torque 
possible. A microwave cable is described in U.S. Patent 4,408,089 
which has a center conductor, insulation around it, and has a layer 
of conductive metal shielding and a thin layer of braided metal 
shielding. The present invention provides a more limp and more 
easily bent microwave cable and a process for its manufacture. The present invention comprises a microwave coaxial cable 
having low resistance to torque comprising in order inside to 
outside: 
(a) a metal center conductor surrounded by a polymeric 
dielectric insulation;  
 (b) a layer of conductive metal shielding; (c) a layer of braided metal shielding; (d) a layer of protective polymeric jacketing and 
characterized in that; (e) particles of graphite positioned between the layers of 
metal shielding and the braided shielding. A cable according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from patent document US-A-4 408 089. The low-torque microwave coaxial cable of the invention 
comprises a metal conductor, preferably of stranded silver-plated 
copper, surrounded by a polymeric dielectric insulation, preferably 
comprising expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The insulated 
conductor is surrounded by a layer of conductive metal shielding 
helically wrapped around the insulated microwave conductor. A 
preferred metal is a foil of silver-plated copper, for example. The helically-wrapped metal foil shielding is surrounded by a  
 
layer of metal braid to further shield the microwave conductor and 
to provide a strength member to the cable. Preferred materials for 
the braid include silver-plated copper, silver-plated steel, 
silver-plated copper clad
