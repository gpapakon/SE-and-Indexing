<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to so-called continuous 
motion can decorators in general and relates more particularly 
to interchangeable inker units for such 
apparatus. Continuous motion apparatus for decorating 
cylindrical containers are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
3,223,028 issued December 14, 1965 to W. E. Brigham for 
An Interchangeable Inking Unit For Multi-Color Presses, 
U.S. Patent No. 3,859,919 issued January 14, 1975 to 
J. P. Skrypek et al. for An Inker Unit For Continuous-Motion 
Printer and U.S. Patent No. 4,741,266 issued May 
3, 1988 to J. S. Stirbis et al. for Can Decorating 
Apparatus. In each of these three patents the decorator 
sections include a continuously rotating blanket wheel 
which transfers an image to the container being 
decorated. The image on the blanket wheel is derived 
from differently colored image segments that are 
imprinted by individual printing plates that are mounted 
on separate plate cylinders. A different colored ink is 
applied to each printing plate by an interchangeable 
inker unit. In the apparatus of the aforesaid U.S. Patents 
Nos. 3,859,919 and 3,223,028 the plate cylinder is part 
of the inker unit while in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 
4,741,266 the plate cylinder remains mounted to the main 
frame of the apparatus when its associated inker unit is  
 
dismounted. The advantage of having the plate cylinder 
separate from the inker unit is that registry between the 
printing cylinders does not have to be reset each time an 
the inker unit is changed. In the instant invention the plate cylinder 
remains in the apparatus when its associated inker unit 
is removed. This speeds up removal and replacement of 
inker units. Further economy of time is achieved without 
sacrificing performance by having four locating 
depressions in the edges of vertical main frame members 
and utilizing quick release clamps to secure the inker 
unit to the main frame. These clamps engage two strong 
parallel rods that are parts of the inker unit. The 
locating rods are received by the locating depressions on 
the main frame. By having the locating depressions open at the 
edges of frame members the support rods enter the depressions 
by moving radially rather than by moving axially. 
In the aforesaid U.S. Patent 4,741,266 mounting and 
dismounting of the inker unit is a cumbersome procedure 
because it must be moved sideways through an opening in 
the main frame, followed by the necessity of inserting 
dowels into locating depressions and then threading 
retainer bolts to
