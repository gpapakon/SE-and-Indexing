<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hard surface cleaner. The invention relates to a non-rinse, isotropic hard 
surface cleaner especially adapted to be used on glossy or 
smooth, hard surfaces, such as glass windows and the like, 
which removes soils deposited thereon, while significantly 
reducing the amount of residue caused by unremoved soil, 
cleaner, or a combination thereof. Cleaning hard, glossy surfaces such as glass windows has 
proven to be problematic. To remove soils deposited on such 
surfaces, the typical approach is to use an alkaline ammonium-based 
aqueous cleaner or other aqueous cleaners containing 
various mixtures of surfactants and other cleaning additives. 
Unfortunately, many of the ammonia-based cleaners have fairly 
poor soil removing ability, while many of the surfactant-based 
cleaners leave fairly significant amounts of residue on such 
hard, glossy surfaces. This residue is seen in the phenomena 
of streaking, in which the soil, cleaner, or both are 
inconsistently wicked off the surface, and filming, in which 
a thin layer of the residue actually clings to the surface 
desired to be cleaned. Baker et al., U.S. Patent 4,690,779, demonstrated a hard 
surface cleaner having improved non-streaking/filming 
properties in which a combination of low molecular weight  
 
polymer (e.g., polyethylene glycol) and certain surfactants 
were combined. Corn et al., E.P. 0393772 and E.P. 0428816, describe hard 
surface cleaners containing anionic surfactants with ammonium 
counterions, and additional adjuncts. G.B. 2,160,887 describes a cleaning system in which a 
combination of nonionic and anionic surfactants (including an 
alkanolamine salt alkyl sulfate) is contended to enhance 
cleaning efficacy. WO 91/11505 describes a glass cleaner containing a 
zwitterionic surfactant, monoethanolamine and/or betaaminoalkanols 
as solvents/buffers for assertedly improving 
cleaning and reducing filming spotting. The invention provides an aqueous, hard surface cleaner 
with significantly improved residue removal and substantially 
reduced filming/streaking, said cleaner comprising: 
(a) an effective amount of a solvent selected from C₁₋₆ 
alkanol, C₃₋₂₄ alkylene glycol ether, and mixtures thereof; (b) an effective amount of at least one nonionic 
surfactant; (c) an effective amount of a buffering system which 
comprises a nitrogenous buffer selected from the group 
consisting of:
