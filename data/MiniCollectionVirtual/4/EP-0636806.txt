<ABSTRACT>
Device for operating a clutch including an annular thrust bearing (6) which can be moved axially relative to an elastic diaphragm (5) for return to the clutch-engaged position under the action of a clutch-release fork (9) and having two lateral arms (14) allowing the fork (9) to be indexed and allowing rollers (13) mounted on the fingers (15) of the latter to bear.

<CLAIMS>
A clutch control device comprising an annular bearing (6) provided with two lateral
arms (14) displaceable axially in relation to an elastic diaphragm (5) for return

movement into the engaged position, by the action of a clutch release fork (9) which
bears by means of rollers (13) on said lateral arms (14), characterised in that each

lateral arm (14) has an external longitudinal surface (17) permitting the indexing of
the fork (9), and a transverse surface (19) permitting support for a roller (13).
A clutch control device according to Claim 1, characterised in that each roller (13) is
free to rotate on a shaft (16) passing through the prong (15) of the fork (9).
A clutch control device according to Claim 2, characterised in that each roller (13) is
disposed against the inner face (18) of a prong (15) of the fork (9).
A clutch control device according to Claim 2 or Claim 3, characterised in that the
rollers (13) are distanced laterally from the lateral arms (14).
A clutch control device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the rollers (13) are needle rollers.
