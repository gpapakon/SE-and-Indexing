<ABSTRACT>
The object is to carry out the preparation of strong and durable bonds between strengthening elements of polyamide (nylon) having essentially planar surfaces and vulcanisable rubber mixtures, for example for vehicle tyres, using environmentally-acceptable and health-compatible processes. A further aim is to improve the resistance of the RFL adhesion promoters applied to reaction with atmospheric moisture. This is achieved by a process for the preparation of such composites using an adhesion promoter comprising an aqueous dispersion of a resorcinol-formaldehyde/latex mixture to which an aqueous solution of a partially or fully hydrolysed, low-viscosity, highly polymeric compound has been added. The novel process can advantageously be used in the rubber-processing industry, in particular in the production of vehicle tyres or other vulcanisation products containing strengthening elements of polyamide.
