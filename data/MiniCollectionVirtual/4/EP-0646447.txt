<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for manufacturing a multi-layer 
plastic product comprised of a hollow plastic core (1) and an 

outer plastic layer (2) formed on the core are provided. A mold 
has a plurality of segments (3a,3b) and is provided with a plurality 

of supply ports (7a-7e) arranged in a desired pattern. The mold is 
assembled with the hollow plastic core (1) located in a mold 

cavity, and, then, a molten plastic material is supplied 
into the mold cavity through the plurality of supply ports (7a-7e). 

Then, the mold is set in its clamped condition to carry out 
shaping of the molten plastic material into the outer layer (2) 

having a desired shape. Since the molten plastic material 
is supplied through a plurality of supply ports (7a-7e), the 

pressure inside the mold cavity during supply and shaping 
steps is maintained at a relatively low pressure level, 

preferably 200 kg/cmÂ², which is much lower than an ordinary 
pressure level used in injection molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
manufacturing a multi-layer plastic product, and, in
particular, to a method and apparatus for manufacturing a
multi-layer plastic product comprised of a hollow core and
an outer layer at a relatively low pressure. More
specifically, the present invention is particularly useful
in manufacturing a multi-layer plastic product having a
relatively complicated structure, such as an intake manifold
for use with an internal combustion engine, and various
ducts, pipes, and hoses, in particular those having a
flange.Typically, ducts and intake manifolds for use in an
automobile having a flange have been made of a metal by
casting. When manufacturing such a product by casting, a
core made of sand or the like is placed in position in a
casting mold and then a molten metal is poured into the
mold. In this case, however, the sand core must be removed
from the mold upon cooling of the molten metal, which is
cumbersome, and, in addition, since it is made of a metal,
the resulting product is heavy. Since it is vital to make
components of an automobile as light as possible to provide 
an increased fuel efficiency, it is disadvantageous to make
an intake manifold or other ducting products in an
automobile from a metal. Under the circumstances, various
proposals have been made to manufacture ducting products,
such as air-intake related products, from a plastic
material, such as a thermoplastic resin.For example, in the case of an air-intake manifold,
several methods have already been developed based on
injection molding of a thermoplastic resin. According to a
core melting method, after placing a core made from a low
melting point metal alloy by injection molding in position
in an injection mold, a molten resin material is injected
into the injection mold, and, then, the metal alloy is
caused to melt by electromagnetic induction to thereby
remove the molten metal alloy from the injection mold.
According to a two component fusing method, two components
are first molded from a resin material by injection molding
and then these two components are integrated together by
fusing, such as vibration fusing. According to a rotating
core method, while defining a curved shape of a product with
a predetermined radius, a resin material is injected into an
injection mold in which a core is provided rotatably, and,
then, the core is rotated for removal from the injection
mold upon completion of injection molding. There has also
been proposed a method using blow molding, in which case,
