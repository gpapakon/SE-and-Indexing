<ABSTRACT>
A single-point impact sensor (10) has a fully 
differential capacitive sense element (12) for providing a 

capacitive difference which is proportional to the 
acceleration of the vehicle. The capacitive difference is 

converted into a digital pulse train signal which is pulse 
density modulated with variations in the capacitance. The 

pulse density of the pulse train is evaluated according to a 
hierarchy of counters and timers to determine if it is 

indicative of an activation worthy event. In one 
embodiment, a non-volatile programmable memory (140) is 

provided to control the operation of the impact sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to impact sensors for
use in the activation of a vehicle passenger restraint
mechanism and, more particularly, to impact sensors which
use accelerometers to detect the occurrence of a high impact
condition in the vehicle.Passive restraint systems such as airbags or automotive
seat belt tensioners have experienced increased usage in
vehicles to protect passengers during frontal collisions.
These types of restraints require no extra action by the
passenger to achieve protection. Rather, the passive
restraint is automatically activated in the event of an
activation worthy impact event.Various types of impact sensors have been designed for
determining if passive restraint, such as inflation of the
airbag, is needed for a given impact event to ensure that
the airbag is inflated only when airbag protection is
necessary. Ideally, the impact sensor is able to
discriminate between activation worthy events and non-activation
worthy events.One type of impact sensing system uses a plurality of
threshold switches in the front region of the vehicle.
These switches send an impact signal for inflating the
airbag if a high impact event is severe enough to close the
switches. Mechanical sensor-based systems of this type too
often rely on sensor redundancy to minimize the negative
effects of any sensor malfunction which may occur. This
requires a large number of switches within each vehicle,
increasing the overall complexity of the impact sensing
system. Wire harnesses which require additional assembly
must also be used in this type of system. Additionally, the
threshold switches must be located in strategic places in
the vehicle where they have the best opportunity to detect
and discriminate between various types of impacts.
Determining these locations requires extensive impact
testing and studying of impact effects on the vehicle to
determine the best placement for the threshold switch 
sensors.Another type of impact sensing system uses single-point
impact sensors instead of multiple switches. This type of
sensor has an accelerometer located in the passenger
compartment of the vehicle to constantly monitor the
acceleration of the vehicle and sense any sudden
deceleration of the vehicle. The output of the
accelerometer is continuously analyzed to determine if and
when deceleration occurs and if the deceleration is caused
by a impact which is severe enough to require activation of
the airbag or other passenger restraint. The impact sensing
system must be sophisticated enough to prevent
