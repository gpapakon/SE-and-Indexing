A method of improving abrasion resistance 
and sensitivity to variations in development time of a 

photographic material comprising a support bearing a 
silver halide emulsion layer comprising at least 50% 

silver chloride which contains in or adjacent the 
emulsion layer a hydrazide nucleating agent and an 

amine booster, the combination of which is capable of 
providing high contrast images, sensitised to 

radiation having a wavelength from 600 to 700 nm 
characterised by sensitising the emulsion wih a 

tricyclic merocyanine dye of the general formula:

substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of 1-5 carbon 

atoms, and
 

   R³, R⁴ and R⁵ are each a substituted or 
unsubstituted alkyl group of 1-5 carbon atoms, and 

wherein at least one of R³, R⁴ and R⁵ contain a water-solubilising 

group,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic
silver halide materials having improved abrasion
resistance, particularly to materials intended for
exposure to radiation having a wavelength of from 600-690
nm, e.g. radiation from a Helium-Neon laser or
laser diode exposing source, and especially to
materials intended for exposure in graphic arts
equipment.Classes of sensitising dyes have previously been
proposed for preparing silver halide materials that
are both sensitive to red radiation having a
wavelength of from 600-690 nm and relatively non-sensitive
to safelight illumination. For example,
British specification 1 471 701 and European
specification 0 363 104 describe the use of tri-heterocyclic
dyes for this purpose.For many years the very high contrast
photographic images needed in the graphic arts and
printing industries were obtained by developing a
'lith' emulsion (usually high in silver chloride
content) in a hydroquinone, low sulphite, 'lith'
developer by the process known as infectious
development. However, such low sulphite developers
are inherently unstable and are particularly
inappropriate for machine processing.Recently emulsions containing hydrazide
nucleating agents have been used and processed in a
developer with conventional amounts of sulphite,
hydroquinone and possibly metol or a pyrazolidone.
Such developers also essentially contain an amine 
additive as described in US Patent 4,269,929. Other
developers containing amines are described in US
Patents 4,668,605 and 4,740,452.Many hydrazides have been proposed for use in
such materials, for example in US Patents 4,323,643,
4,278,748, 4,031,127, 4,030,925 and 4,323,643 and in
European Patent 0,333,435.More recently it has been proposed to incorporate
amine boosters in high contrast materials with the
advantage that it is not necessary to have a special
developer in order to obtain the very high contrast
that is demanded by much graphic arts work. Such
amine boosters are described in Japanese Patent
Publications 140340/85 and 222241/87 and in US Patent
4975354 (European Patent 0,364,166).Classes of sensitising dyes have previously been
proposed for preparing silver halide materials that
are both sensitive to radiation having a wavelength of
from 600-700 nm, e.g. radiation from a Helium-Neon
laser or laser diode exposing source, and especially
to materials intended for exposure in graphic arts
equipment. For example, US Patent 5 079 139 describes
the use of tri-heterocyclic dyes for this purpose
which have the general formula:
