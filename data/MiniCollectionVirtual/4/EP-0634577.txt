<ABSTRACT>
A two-way cartridge valve as lift valve comprises a valve sleeve (112) with a stepped guide bore (180, 182) for a valve piston (114). The valve piston (114) contains a piston extension (184) which axially subdivides the second step (182) of the guide bore into an end first control chamber (186) and an annular second control chamber (188). A first connecting passage (194) through the valve sleeve (112) connects the annular second control chamber (188) to an annular chamber (140) into which a lateral main-flow connection (30) leads. The free cross-section of a valve seat (144) and an axial main-flow bore (146) correspond approximately to the cross-section of the first step (180) of the guide bore.

Two-way cartridge valve as a seat valve comprising 

a) a valve casing (112) for insertion in a control block (20) with 

a first and a second end, 
a first cross-section area (134) at the first end of the valve casing (112) 
for axially sealed fitting into a first bore stage (22) of a stepped bore in the 

control block (20), this first bore stage (22) being connected to a first main flow 
port (28) in the control block (20), 
a second cross-section area (136) of the valve casing (112) for axially 
sealed fitting into a second bore stage (24) of larger diameter in this stepped 

bore, 
a central cross-section area (138) between the first and second cross-section 
areas (134 and 136) of the valve casing (112) for delimiting an annular 

chamber (140) within the second bore stage (24), the second bore stage (24) 
being connected within this annular chamber (140) to a second main flow port 

(30) in the control block (20), 
an axial main flow bore (146), which forms in the first end of the valve 
casing (112) a first main flow opening (148), 
at least one lateral second main flow opening (150) in the central cross-section 
area (138) of the valve casing (112) for connection of the main flow 

bore (146) to the annular chamber (140), and 
a valve seat (144) in the main flow bore (146) between the first and 
second main flow openings (148 and 150), 
b) a valve piston (114) with a first and second end, which is fitted into the 
valve casing (112) with axial movement and at the front forms at its first end a 

closing cone (152) assigned to the valve seat (144),  
 
c) a closing spring (116), which is assigned to the valve piston (114) in 
such a way that it exerts a closing force on the latter in the direction of the 

valve seat (144), and 
d) a valve cover (118), 
characterised in that
the valve casing (112) has a stepped guide bore (180, 182) for the valve piston 
(114), a first stage (180) of the guide bore extending in the central cross-section 

area (138) from the valve seat (144) in the direction of the second end 
of the valve casing (112) and having the largest possible cross-section in this 

area, and a second stage (182) of the guide bore extending essentially within 
the second cross-section area (136) of the valve casing (112) and having a 

larger cross-section than the first stage (180) of the guide bore, 
the valve piston (114) has at its second end a piston extension (184), which 
divides the second stage (182) of the guide bore axially into a front first and an 

annular second control chamber (186 and 188),
 
a first connecting duct (194) connects the annular second control chamber 

(188) to the annular chamber (140) through the valve casing (112),
 
the free cross-sections of the valve seat (144) and of the axial main flow bore 

(146) correspond approximately to the cross-section of the first stage (180) of 
the guide bore. 
Two-way cartridge valve according to claim 1 characterised by a nozzle, 
which is inserted in the first connecting duct (194).  

 
Two-way cartridge valve according to claim 1, characterised by a second 
connecting duct (204), which extends between the first and second control 

chambers (186 and 188) in the piston extension (184). 
Two-way cartridge valve according to claim 3, characterised by a plug 

(208), which is inserted in the first connecting duct (194). 
Two-way cartridge valve according to claim 4, characterised by a nozzle, 
which is inserted in the second connecting duct (204). 
Two-way cartridge valve according to claim 3, characterised by a third 
connecting duct (210), which at the front forms in the first end of the valve 

piston (114) an orifice and connects this to the first control chamber (186) 
through the valve piston (114). 
Two-way cartridge valve according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
first, second and third connecting ducts (194, 204 and 210) have an internal 

thread for screwing in screw-in plugs or screw-in nozzles. 
Two-way cartridge valve according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
by a spring chamber (156), which is arranged axially in the valve piston (114) 

and an annular groove (198) for a sealing element in the piston extension 
(184). 
Two-way cartridge valve according to claim 8, characterised by a sealing 
ring combination consisting of an inner O-ring (202) and an outer sliding ring 

(200), which are arranged in the annular groove (198) of the piston extension 
(184).
