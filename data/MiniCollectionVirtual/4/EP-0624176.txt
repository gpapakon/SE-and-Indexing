<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous starch oil sizing composition is provided which produces improved processibility in woven and non-woven applications. The sizing combines a high amylose corn starch which has been derivatized with propylene oxide, with a low amylose highly crosslinked corn starch. The sizing also includes lubricants which may be oils or waxes and a lubricant which is the salt of a polyamino functional polyamide resin. Other emulsifiers, humectants, lubricants, defoamers, and biocides may be present. The size also includes a silane coupling agent such as gamma glycidoxy propyl trimethoxy silane which can be hydrolyzed. Strands of glass fiber which have been treated with this size have shown a reduced tendency to shed the size from the strands, a reduction in the buildup of broken filaments or "fuzz" on processing equipment and reduced strand breakage.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STARCH OIL SIZING COMPOSITION AND GLASS FIBERS TREATED THEREWITH5 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention is directed to a starch oil type sizing composition and glass fibers that have been treated with a the composition.Glass fibers are produced by flowing molten glass via10 gravity through a multitude of small openings in a precious metal plate, called a bushing. During their formation these fibers are treated with a sizing composition which serves to protect the fibers from abrasion with each other. The term sizing means an aqueous chemical treatment which is applied to the glass fibers to impart15 certain properties as discussed below. After their formation and treatment, the fibers are gathered together into strands and wound on a "forming package". The forming packages are usually dried in either an oven or at room temperature to remove the moisture from the fibers. The fibers are then typically wound onto a bobbin via20 conventional textile twisting techniques such as a twist frame. The sizing composition serves also to improve the performance of the fibers during further processing. Such further processing can include weaving of the fibers, which involves removing the fiber from the bobbin and guiding the fiber over or through a25 series of guide bars and other points of physical contact where wear could occur. Examples of the manifestation of such wear can be seen in the buildup of broken filaments or "fuzz" on the contact points, an increase in static electricity, poor quality of the woven product, as well as the shedding of the sizing from the fibers, or the breaking of30 the strand itself during ea in .The strands of treated glass fiber may also be used in non woven applications such as the manufacture of fiber glass reinforced«> tape. In this application the strand can undergo abrasion and wear similar to that experienced in the woven applications as it is removed35 from the bobbin and processed. 

 It is an object of this invention to produce strands of glass fiber having a moisture reduced residue of a starch oil type sizing composition which results in improved processibility of the fibers with reduced fuzz production, reduced shedding, and greater strand integrity.I . Summary of the InventionThe objects of the invention are accomplished by strands of treated glass fibers where the treatment is an aqueous starch oil composition. There are two starches present, one of which is a highly crosslinked low amylose non-ionic corn starch. The second starch is a high amylose corn starch
