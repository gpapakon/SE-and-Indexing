<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus is provided with sheet
supporting means on which sheets are supported thereon,

sheet feeding means for feeding the sheets from the
sheet supporting means, sheet conveying means for

conveying the sheets fed by the sheet feeding means to
the vicinity of image forming means for forming images

on the sheets, image forming and conveying means for
feeding the sheets conveyed by the sheet conveying

means to the image forming means so as to be capable of
forming images thereon, and control means for

controlling the sheet conveying speed of the sheet
feeding means, the sheet conveying means and the image

forming and conveying means, and the control means
controls so that the sheet conveying speed may become

higher in the order of the sheet feeding means, the
image forming and conveying means and the sheet

conveying means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming
apparatus such as an electrophotographic type analog-digital
copying machine, a color copying machine, a
printer or a page printer.When image formation is to be done at a high
speed, for example, in an electrophotographic type
image forming apparatus, the image forming speed
thereof has been realized by effecting, in addition to
the supply and conveyance of transfer paper which is a
sheet, an image forming process, i.e., a series of
operations such as latent image formation, development,
the transfer of a toner image to a transfer sheet and
fixing at a high speed. For example, to realize an
image forming apparatus capable of forming 60 sheets of
images per minute in contrast with an image forming
apparatus capable of forming 30 sheets of images per
minute, the driving speed necessary for the image
forming process, in addition to the supply and
conveyance of the transfer sheet, has been set to two
times.In the above-described example of the prior art,
however, in order to realize high-speed image 
formation, it has been required to effect the image
forming process at a high speed, in addition to the
conveyance of the transfer sheet, and large-scaled
studies have been required.Thus, for example, in the latent image formation
in the image forming process, it is necessary in a
digital image forming apparatus to operate image
processing and latent image forming means such as a
laser at a high speed, and when for example,
development from an image forming apparatus capable of
forming 30 sheets of images per minute to an image
forming apparatus capable of forming 60 sheets of
images per minute is to be done, the image processing
portion or the like in which the image clock frequency
thereof has been made double has been required.Also, in an analog image forming apparatus, it has
been necessary to double the driving speed of an
original scanner for scanning an original to be copied.Further, in both apparatuses, the image forming
process such as the development and transfer of a toner
image is, as it were, the most important technique in
an electrophotographic type image forming apparatus,
and a long study time has been required until the
constructing and technique thereof are determined, and
a great deal of resources have been required for the
development of an image forming apparatus accompanying
high-speed image formation. An image forming apparatus comprising the features summarized
in the pre-characterizing clause of claim 1 is known from
document JP-A-04337748. In
