<ABSTRACT>
A slatted bed base comprises slats which are supported in a base frame (1) via side pieces (3) in such a way as to be movable downwards against spring force. In order to ensure with a construction free of metal a sensitive adaptation of the slat position to the body contour of a resting person, the side pieces (3) are in each case mounted on the base frame by means of a slotted guide (5) and are spring-loaded in the direction of the slotted guide, which slotted guide (5) consists of a vertical guiding slot (6) on the one hand and a horizontal guiding pin (7) engaging in the guiding slot (6) on the other hand, also of pivoting stops (8, 9) limiting the pivotability of the side piece (3) about the guiding pin (7).

A slatted bed comprising slats which are supported
in a base frame (1) so as to be movable downwardly

against spring force by way of side pieces (3), the
latter being mounted on the base frame (1) in each case

by means of a slotted guide (5) consisting, on the one
hand, of a vertical guide slot (6) and, on the other

hand, of a horizontal guide pin (7) engaging in the
guide slot (6), and being spring-loaded in the

direction of the slotted guide, characterised in that
the side pieces (3) rest at their undersides on an

elastomeric support band (11) clamped between support
bolts (13) fixed to the base frame, and the slotted

guides (5) comprise pivot stops (8, 9) which limit the
pivotability of the side pieces (3) about the guide

pins (7).
A slatted bed according to claim 1, characterised
in that the pivot stops are formed, on the one hand, by

at least one vertical receiving slot (8) and, on the
other hand, by a horizontal stop pin (9) engaging in

the receiving slot (8) with radial clearance.
A slatted bed according to claim 2, characterised
in that the receiving slot (8) has a slot width which

varies in the vertical direction.
A slatted bed according to claim 1, having head,
foot and shoulder parts, which are disposed in a base

frame (201) so as to be relatively movable to one
another, the shoulder part being supported on the base

frame (201) so as to be movable downwardly against
spring force by way of its side members (202), 

characterised in that at least two side pieces are
combined in each case to form a side member (202),

which side members are mounted in slotted guides (204)
each consisting, on the one hand, of two parallel

vertical guide slots (205) and, on the other hand, two
horizontal guide pins (206) engaging in the guide slots

(205) with radial clearance, and rest at their
underside on elastomeric support bands (211) clamped

between support bolts (213) fixed to the base frame.
A slatted bed according to any one of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that support bolts (13) are

provided on the base frame (1) laterally next to and
between the side pieces (3) and common support bands

(11) are provided for adjacent side pieces (3).
A slatted bed according to claim 4, characterised
in that the side membe
rs (202) form support heads (210)
at their underside in the region of the pairs of slots

and pins (205, 206), said support heads (210)
projecting by approximately the guide slot length, and

support bolts (213) for the support bands (211) are
provided on the base frame (201) laterally next to and

between the support heads (210).
A slatted bed according to any one of claims 1 to
6, characterised in that the support bands (11, 211)

form loops (12, 212) and are pushed on to the support
bolts (13, 213).
