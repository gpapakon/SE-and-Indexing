<ABSTRACT>
An industrial process for recovering L-phenylalanine from a side 
stream obtained from the production of α-APM at high yield is 

established. For recovering L-phenylalanine from at least one side stream 
generated in the process for the production of α-APM, L-aspartic acid or 

an aqueous solution thereof is added when the hydrolysis of the above 
side stream is performed under acidic conditions with a mineral acid, or 

when the pH of the reaction mixture obtained by hydrolysis is adjusted 
to 5 to 6 to precipitate L-phenylalanine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 
methyl ester (hereinafter referred to as α-APM), which is 
about 200 times as sweet as sucrose and is in great demand for dietary 
sweeteners due to its good sweet taste and low caloric value. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a process for recovering L-phenylalanine 
from the side stream generated from a process for producing α-APM. Various processes for producing α-APM are known, for example a 
process which comprises reacting N-protected L-aspartic anhydride with 
L-phenylalanine methyl ester (US Patent Ser. No. 3786039), a process 
which comprises reacting N-protected L-aspartic anhydride with L-phenylalanine 
(US Patent Ser.No. 4173562), a process which comprises 
condensing N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine 
methyl ester with an enzyme (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 
92729-1978). However, to employ them as low cost industrial process, it 
is necessary to recover and reuse L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid 
from side streams obtained during a process for the production of α-APM 
such as α-APM mother liquor or α-APM·HCl mother liquor, since these 
side streams contain a significant amount of L-phenylalanine derivatives,  
 
L-aspartic acid derivatives and β-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester 
and α-APM. Of these, it is very important to efficiently recover L-phenylalanine, 
which is an expensive amino acid. For recovering L-phenylalanine 
from a side stream generated during a process for the 
production of α-APM a process disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-open No. 97812-1973 is known. The process comprises the 
hydrolysis of a solution containing β-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl 
ester in the presence of a mineral acid, adjusting the pH of the reaction 
solution to 6 for the crystallization and separation of L-phenylalanine. 
The mother liquor after separation still contains a considerable amount of 
L-phenylalanine. Accordingly, it is expected that the recovery may be 
further improved if the solubility of L-phenylalanine could be reduced. 
EP-A-55612 also relates to the recovery of L-phenylalanine. The problem to be solved by the invention is to establish an 
industrial process to efficiently recover L-phenylalanine from a side 
stream generated in the production of α-APM. The present inventors have intensively studied a process for the 
efficient recovery of L-phenylalanine from a side stream obtained in a 
process for the production of α-APM. As the
