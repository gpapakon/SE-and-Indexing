Digital device to measure the frequency of an 
electrical signal (x(t)), characterized in that 


a linear-phase, non-recursive digital filter, 
loaded with the electrical signal (x(t)) and 

having symmetrical distribution of its filter 
coefficients (a(n)) is constructed as an all-pass 

filter (3), 
an additional linear-phase, non-recursive digital 
filter, likewise loaded with the electrical signal 

(x(t)) and having symmetrical distribution of its 
filter coefficients (t(n)) is developed as a low-pass 

filter (20) in such a way that its transfer 
function (T(n)) at a specified frequency (f
n
) of 
the electrical signal (x(t)) has the value "one", 
a circuit unit (4) is arranged downstream of the 
all-pass tilter (3), which unit 


contains in a branch on the input side a 
linear-phase transversal filter (5) with 

symmetrical distribution of its filter 
coefficients (h(n)), a delay element (7) 

connected downstream thereof and a 
subsequently arranged multiplier (8) and 
has in a branch parallel to the one branch on 
the input side an additional linear-phase 

transversal filter (6) with antisymmetric 
distribution of its filter coefficients 

(g(n)) and a value "one" of its transfer 
function at the specified frequency (f
n
), an 
additional delay element (9) connected 

downstream thereof and a subsequently 
arranged additional multiplier (10), whereby 


the one multiplier (8) is connected on the 
input side also to an output of the 

additional transversal filter (6) and the 
additional multiplier (10) is also connect
ed  
 

to the output of the one transversal filter 
(5), and 
contains a difference former (11) which is 
connected by its inputs to the outputs of the 

multipliers (8,10), 
a circuit device (21), the assembly of which is 
identical to that of the circuit unit (4), is 

arranged downstream of the low-pass filter (20), 
the outputs of the difference formers (11,22) of 
the circuit unit (4) and the circuit device (21) 

are connected to a quotient former (23) downstream 
of which a root extractor (24) is arranged, and 
an inverse function former (2b) is connected to 
the root extractor (24). 
Digital device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


all filters (3,5,6,20) are filters of the second 
order, and 
the all-pass filter (3) has the filter 
coefficients

a(1) = 1 
a(2) = 0, 
the low-pass filter (20) has the filter 
coefficients

symmetrical distribution of its filter 

coefficients has the filter coefficients

h(1) = 1 
h(2) = 0 and 
the linear-phase transversal filter (6) with 
antisymmetric distribution of its filter  

 
coefficients has the filter coefficients 


g(0) = - 0.5 
g(1) = 0 
g(2) = + 0.5 and 
the sampling frequency (fab') amounts to four 
times the specified frequency (f
n

Digital device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that 


a band-pass filter (1) is arranged upstream of 
both the all-pass filter (3) and the low-pass 

filter (20), which band-pass filter is a digital 
filter, and 
the sampling frequency of the band-pass filter (1) 
is four times the sampling frequency (fab') of the 

other filters (3,5,6,20).
