<ABSTRACT>
The method for verifying mailpieces includes the 
steps of creating a mailpiece image having a set of data 

included in a postal revenue block and storing the images 
in a verification image file. The data from the postal 

revenue blocks in the verification image file are converted 
into corresponding data representative of the characters in 

the postal revenue block of the image of the mailpiece, 
preferably as ASCII data. The ASCII data is stored in a 

verification file which may be transmitted as desired. 
Verification of the mailpiece data can be performed at any 

time off-line using the corresponding data in the 
verification file. The conversion may be made by keying in 

the data or using bar code or OCR where the data is machine 
readable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to mail processing systems and 
more particularly to postage metering systems which provide 
meter indicias including encryption data. In mail distribution operations at the various post 
offices worldwide, mail carrying value-bearing meter 
impressions is received in enormous volumes. In order to 
cope with the increasing volumes of mail in these mail 
distribution centers, the mailpieces are now automatically 
processed by sorters to sort the mail according to its destination. 
With these volumes of mail, it has become extremely 
important to the Post Office that nothing interrupts the 
mail stream processing so as to reduce the efficiency of 
mail delivery. From the mailer's point of view, recent advances in 
digital printing technology have made it possible to 
implement digital, i.e. bit map addressable, printing for 
the purpose of evidencing payment of postage by a postage-meter-like 
device. In order to distinguish such postage-meter-like 
devices from the typical postage meter, such 
devices will be named herein Postage Evidencing Devices or 
PED's. The computer driven printer can print the postal 
indicia in a desired location on the face of a mail piece. 
As used herein the postal indicia will be defined as the 
Postal Revenue Block or PRB. The PRB typically contains 
data such as the postage value, a unique PED identification 
number, the date and in some applications the name of the 
place where the mail is originating. From the Post Office's point of view again, it will 
be appreciated that the digital printing makes it fairly 
easy to counterfeit the PRB since any suitable computer may 
be used to generate multiple images.  It is known to prevent such counterfeiting by 
including certain information in the block in both 
plaintext and ciphertext. For example the postage amount, 
date and sequential piece count can be encrypted using 
either a secret or public key encryption algorithm and 
printed along with the plaintext counterpart in the PRB. 
When the address information is also included in the 
ciphertext, the mailpiece is authenticated. To authenticate the mailpiece, the verifying 
Authority again generates the encryption from the plaintext 
using the identical key used by the purported mailer. If 
the printed ciphertext matches, the mailpiece is verified. 
If there is no match then appropriate action may be 
initiated. The process may be automated using a device 
with scanning capabilities as described in U.S. Patent 
Number 5,308,932, assigned to the Assignee

<CLAIMS>
A method for verifying mailpieces comprising the steps 
of creating a mailpiece image of a mailpiece having a set 

of data included in a postal revenue block, said mailpiece 
image being stored as one of a plurality of mailpiece 

images in a verification image file; thereafter converting 
the data from each of the postal revenue blocks in the 

verification image file into corresponding data 
representative of at least some of the characters in the 

postal revenue block of the image of the mailpiece; storing 
the corresponding data in a verification file; and 

thereafter performing verification of each of the 
mailpieces using the corresponding data of each mailpiece 

image in the verification file. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of creating the 
mailpiece image utilizes a video camera for obtaining the 

image of the mailpiece. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of creating the 
mailpiece image utilizes a scanner for obtaining the image 

of the mailpiece. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of converting the 
data is obtained by keying in the data read from the image 

of the mailpiece in the verification image file. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the data in the postal 
revenue block is machine readable data. 
A method for verifying mailpieces comprising the steps 
of creating mailpiece images of a plurality of mailpieces 

each having a set of data included in a postal revenue 
block; storing each said mailpiece image as one of a 

plurality of mailpiece images in a verification image file: 
thereafter converting the data from the postal revenue 

blocks stored as mailpiece images in the verification image 
 

file into corresponding ASCII data representative of at 
least some of the characters in the postal revenue blocks 

of the images of the mailpieces; storing the corresponding 
ASCII data in a verification file; and thereafter 

performing verification of the mailpiece using the 
corresponding ASCII data in the verification file. 
The method of claim 6 further comprising the step of 
recording a unique number associated with a mailpiece for 

later retrieval of the mailpiece in the event that the 
postal revenue block cannot be validated.
