<ABSTRACT>
A heat sensitive lithographic printing original plate comprising a hydrophilic layer containing a lipophilic 
constituent that is transformed to an imaging section by heat and microcapsulated and a hydrophilic binder polymer 

and a substrate wherein the hydrophilic binder polymer is three-dimensionally crosslinked and has a functional group 
that is chemically bonded with the lipophilic constituent in the microcapsule after the capsule is broken, and wherein the 

lipophilic constituent in the microcapsule has a functional group that is chemically bonded to the hydrophilic binder 
polymer after the capsule is broken. A heat sensitive lithographic printing original plate according to the present 

invention is superior in plate wear and storability and can provide printing matters which are free from scumming and 
have a clear image. Furthermore, there is needed no development in a plate producing process and therefore there is 

no need of disposing waste liquid. As a result of this, it can be used as an original plate not only for a simple printing 
such as an in-house printing but also for newspaper rotary press printing and also for form printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct
thermosensitive lithographic printing original plate for offset
printing showing high printing durability and not requiring a
developing process, and to a platemaking process using the
same.Various platemaking processes for lithographic
printing plates as well as plate materials have been proposed,
as seen in the wide use of computers. From the standpoint of
practical use, a lithographic printing original plate is
prepared by transferring block copies from a positive/negative
film. On the other hand, electrophotography and Silver
lithographic plates, which are directly made from block copies
without using a positive/negative film, have also been
developed. Further, so-called "Computer to Plate (CTP)" type
plate material has been proposed. In the use of this plate
material, graphic information made by computer type setting and
DTP (Desktop Publishment) is directly printed onto a plate by
using a laser or a thermal printing-head without visualized
hard media. This plate material has not been applied to 
practical use yet. However, since CTP enables the
rationalization and shortening of the platemaking process as
well as the reduction of material costs, there is a great
demand for practical use of the CTP in a field such as news
printing where CTS (Cold Type System) is employed for all
printings.Photosensitive plates, thermosensitive plates, and
plates made by electrical energy have been known as CTP type
plate material. The photosensitive plate and the plate made by
electrical energy have not been used in practice, since not
only the price of those plates are higher than that of
conventional presensitized plates (PS plates) but also
platemaking machine used for preparing them are large-sized and
expensive. Moreover, they have a problem in that they require
waste treatment of a developing solution.The thermosensitive plate materials are developed for
use in light printing, e.g., for printing in offices. Japanese
