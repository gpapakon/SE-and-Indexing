<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a gas burner (20) which employs 
a two stage flame stabilizer. At low input rates, a fully aerated 

flame is stabilized at the surface of a porous material (26). At higher 
input rates, the flame blows off and is held by flame stabilization 

tabs (28). Such structures of this type, generally, operate over a very 
wide range of input rates and employ a highly aerated flame 

which reduces the flame temperature, slows NOx production, and 
increases the overall reaction rate by shortening the flame while 

reducing carbon monoxide (CO) caused by flame impingement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas burner.It is known, in gas appliance burners, to make use of
a porous wire gauze. As shown in Figure 1, gas appliance burner
2, includes in part, tube 4, porous wire gauze 6, fuel-air inlet 8,
flame 10, stove top 12, conventional cookware 14, and cover plate
16. During the operation of conventional gas appliance burner 2,
fuel and air are introduced through inlet 8 into tube 4. This fuel
and air mixture then interacts with gauze 6 and is combusted
such that flame 10 is created. Located above flame 10 is
conventional cookware 14. Cookware 14 may, for example, be a
sauce pan. Cookware 14 is located on top of stove top 12.
Optionally, a high temperature ceramic cover plate 16 may be
located over the opening in stove top 12 where the heat from flame
10 interacts with cookware 14. While such a burner system 2,
often termed an infrared burner, has met with a degree of
commercial success, there are several problems associated with
this conventional burner 2.One of the problems with burner system 2 is a
cleanability problem. As can be seen in Figure 1, if liquids
contained within cookware 14 were allowed to boil over cookware
14, these liquids may come in contact with gauze 6 and flame 10,
thereby, reducing the efficiency of flame 10. However, if plate 16 is
placed over the hole in cooktop 12, then, there are problems
associated with the use of plate 16. For example, plate 16, 
typically, is a ceramic glass plate. These ceramic glass plates are
expensive. Also, there is a possibility that the ceramic glass plate
16 may be broken if cookware 14 is accidently dropped upon plate
16. Finally, burner system 2 has a narrow operating range.
Ideally, a burner should operate between 1,000 and 10,000 BTU/hr (1 kW = 947,8·10-3 BTU/S).
However, burner 2, typically, operates only between 3,000 and
10,000 BTU/hr. The importance of the lower BTU range, namely,
between 1,000 and 3,000, is that in this range, the burner operates
in what is commonly referred to as the "simmer" heating range.
If burner 2 is not capable of achieving this lower BTU range, then
burner 2 is not able to perform the "simmer" operation which is
necessary of all stove tops in order to cook with a very low amount
of heat. Therefore, a more advantageous burner, then, would be
presented if a wider BTU range could be achieved while allowing
the burner to be inexpensive and easily cleaned.It is apparent from the above that there exists a need
in the art for a gas burner which is inexpensive, and which at
least equals the
