<ABSTRACT>
A brief or panty is fabricated from a single piece 
of polyamide elastane knitted material from a single 

piece so that the finished garment has a double 
thickness across its front and a single head to toe 

material edge material joining seams arranged at the 
centre rear of the garment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns improvements in or 
relating to garments, especially garments known 
variously as panties, knickers, briefs, referred to 
hereinafter as briefs. It is often desireable that at least part of the 
front panel of a brief is elasticated to give control to 
the wearer's figure. In the past, elastication has been 
provided by incorporating within the garment a panel of 
an elastic material, the panel having been stitched 
together with other panels to form the garment. A disadvantage of this method is that in view of 
the number of panels required, manufacture of the 
garment is relatively time consuming. Furthermore, in 
view of the nature of the materials used and 
consequently the stitching required to join adjacent 
panels together, particularly the elasticated panel to 
the adjoining panels, the stitched seems have been 
raised and give an unslightly appearance when the brief 
worn under close fitting outerwear. It is an object of the present invention to 
obviate or mitigate these disadvantages. In the manufacture of a brief the basic garment is  
 
often enhanced by the addition of lace panels or edges, 
waist and leg elastication and a cotton gusset, 
especially when the garment is manufactured from a 
material other than cotton. In this specification 
present invention the basic garment, that is the garment 
excluding the enhancement pieces, will be referred to as 
the "main structure". According to the present invention, there is 
provided a brief, the main structure of which is 
fabricated by folding and stitching from a single piece 
of material cut to a predetermined shape. Preferably the material is elasticated. It may be 
a material knitted from a polyamide elastane yarn, for 
example, LYCRA (Registered Trade Mark), with the knitted 
ribs running in the head to toe direction of the garment 
when worn. Preferably the piece of material from which the 
main structure of the garment is manufacturered 
comprises a front body portion having formed integrally 
therewith a waist band portion from which extends a 
control panel portion and a main body portion having 
formed integrally therewith two opposed wing portions 
and a crotch portion.  Preferably, on manufacture, the waist band and 
control panel and folded over against the front body 
portion and stitched along their free edges to the body 
portion to provide a double thickness area of material. 
Preferably the stitching employed allows movement of the 
material in mutually perpendicular directions. The

<CLAIMS>
A brief characterised in that the main structure 
of the brief is fabricated by folding and stitching from 

a single piece of material cut to a predetermined shape.

that the material is knitted from a polyamide elastane 

yarn with the knitted ribs running in the head to toe 
direction of the garment when worn. 
A brief as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the piece of material from which the main 

structure of the garment is manufactured comprises a 
front body portion (10) having formed integrally 

therewith a waist band portion (12) from which extends a 
control panel portion (14) the front body portion (10) 

having formed integrally therewith two opposed wing 
portions (16,18) and a crotch portion (20). 
A brief as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that on manufacture, the waist band (12) and control 

panel (14) are folded over against the front body 
portion (10) and stitched along their free edges to the 

body portion to provide a double thickness area of 
material.

in that the front body portion (10) forms the front 

panel of the garment and the wing portions (16,18) when 
folded over on top of the front body portion (10), are 

jointed by stitching (36) along their then mating edges. 
A brief as claimed in claim 6, characterised in 
that the seam (36) along the mating edges of the wing 

portions (16,18) is formed by overstitching. 
A brief as claimed in any of claims 4-7, 
characterised in that the free end (30) of the crotch 

portion (14) is stitched to the lower end of the wing 
portions (16,18) by a three point zig zag stitch (40). 
A brief as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 8, 
characterised in that it includes elasticated trim 

stitched around the leg openings using a three point zig 
zag stitch. 
A brief as claimed in any one of claim 4 to 9, 
characterised in that the crotch portion (14) is lined 

on its inner face with a cotton gusset whose forward end
