<ABSTRACT>
The burner chamber wall extends from the chamber inlet (12) to the turbine (20) which has in this area Helmholtz dampers formed with a multi-cellular structure and set at least in some areas on the burner chamber wall (18) and/or on the front panel. The multi-cellular structure can be formed by mats and the structure of the dampers can be of different sizes. The number of cells of the structure is preferably between 10000 and 30000. At least one part of the Helmholtz dampers is cooled by a cooling air stream.

<CLAIMS>
Gas-turbine combustion chamber having reduced

thermoacoustic oscillations, the combustion-chamber
wall (18) of which extends from the combustion-chamber

inlet (12) up to the turbine (20), and in which burners
(16) are fastened to a front panel (36), Helmholtz

dampers (42) being arranged in the region of the
combustion chamber (10), at least in sections on the

combustion-chamber wall (18) and/or on the front panel
(36), which are elements of a multicell structure, and

cooling air flowing through at least some of the
Heimholtz dampers (42), 
characterized in that
 the
multicell structure comprises honeycombed mats.
Gas-turbine combustion chamber according to
Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the multicell structure comprises honeycombed mats with
different properties
Gas-turbine combustion chamber according to
Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the number of cells of
the multicell structure is between 1000 and about

200,000, preferably between 5000 and 50,000, and in
particular preferably between 10,000 and 30,000.
