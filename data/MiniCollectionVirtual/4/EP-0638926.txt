<ABSTRACT>
A bump forming step forms a predetermined 
number of bumps (13) on at least a first one (11) of 

two components (11 and 17). A height measuring step 
measures the heights (H) of the predetermined number of 

bumps (13). A fixing step fixes the two components (11 
and 17) together by means of the bumps (13) with the 

distance (L₁) between the two components (11 and 17) 
determined, using the result of the height measurement, 

so that all of the predetermined number of bumps (13) 
should come into contact with the second one (17) of 

the two components (11 and 17). An oxide-film removing 
step removes the oxide film (15) formed on the 

predetermined number of bumps (13) after the height 
measuring step and before the fixing step. The fixing 

step comprises a press fixing step for press fixing the 
two components (11 and 17), and a melting step for 

causing the bumps (13) to melt in a predetermined 
atmosphere so that the bumps firmly join the two 

components (11 and 17) together. The distance (L₁) is 
established by at least one of the press fixing step 

and the melting step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of
fabricating a semiconductor unit employing a flipchip
function.Recently, high-speed operation has been demanded
of semiconductor units. Thus, not only highspeed
operation of semiconductor devices themselves but also
shortening of circuit lengths between the semiconductor
devices are required. For this purpose, the
miniaturization of semiconductor devices and narrowing
of bonding pitches are needed. The shortening of the
total circuit length may be achieved by soldering
electronic devices to substrates using lead-less chip
carriers (LCC) and flip chip bonding.In order to secure an electronic device such as a
semiconductor device onto a substrate, solder bumps are
formed on at least a first one of the electronic device
and the substrate. Then, the said first one is
positioned on the second of the electronic device and
the substrate so that the thus-formed bumps meet the
corresponding electrodes provided on the said second
one. Then, the bumps are made to reflow so that the
bumps join the electronic device onto the substrate.
In this case, flux is used.The flux acts to provisionally maintain the
spatial relationship between the electronic device and
the substrate by lying between the bumps and the second
one of the electronic device and the substrate. The
flux further acts to create sufficient wetting
conditions between the solder bumps and the
corresponding electrodes.However, the flux may cause problems as described
below. The flux is cleaned away after bonding has been
completed. If any residue of flux is left after
cleaning, the active ingredients contained therein may
cause corrosion. Furthermore, the toxicity of the flux
may pollute the environment if the liquid waste 
produced in cleaning is discharged.In addition, flux cleaning may become difficult if
the distances between the components or semiconductor
devices and the substrates are made small so as to
shorten the total circuit length. In particular, if
the flip chip bonding is applied to the solder bonding,
since the distance between the semiconductor device and
the substrate to be joined together is short, flux
cleaning is difficult, and checking the effectiveness
of flux cleaning is also difficult.On the other hand, omission of flux application to
the solder bonding may result in poor bonding because
of insufficient wetting conditions between the bumps
and the electrodes. Displacement positioning errors
may also occur between the electronic device and the
substrate during the period between the
