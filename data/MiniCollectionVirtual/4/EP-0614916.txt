<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a polyolefin. More particularly, it pertains to a
process for efficiently producing a polyolefin, particularly
a linear low-density polyethylene in the presence of a
catalyst having a high polymerization activity in a reduced
amount of an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent which is harmful to
health without using an expensive metallocene compound as the
polymerization catalyst.In recent years, in a process for producing a polyolefin,
a catalyst comprising a metallocene compound of a
transition metal and an aluminoxane has been suggested as a
novel uniform catalyst (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No. 19309/1983). This uniform catalyst has a very high
activity and an excellent copolymerizability, but the metallocene
compound and the aluminoxane are more expensive as
compared with a conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst. Thus,
the suggested catalyst has a problem that its cost is high.In order to overcome the above-mentioned drawback,
there has been suggested a method in which a uniform catalyst
comprising an oxygen-containing titanium compound and an
aluminoxane is used without employing any metallocene compound
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 3008/1988).
However, this method also has a problem that a catalytic 
activity is so low that a polyolefin cannot be efficiently
produced.Furthermore, in the above-mentioned catalyst system
using the aluminoxane, a large amount of an aromatic hydrocarbon
such as toluene is used as a polymerization solvent or
a catalyst control solvent, but the aromatic hydrocarbon has
a problem of carcinogenicity or the like. For this reason,
it is desired to use another safe polymerization solvent or
catalyst control solvent.The group of the present inventors has already
suggested, as a technique for solving the above-mentioned
problem, a process using a catalyst which mainly comprises a
specific transition metal compound, an aluminoxane, an
organic aluminum compound and/or a compound having a π
electron (Japanese Patent Application No. 234077/1992).Under such circumstances, an object of the present
invention is to provide a process for efficiently producing a
polyolefin in the presence of a catalyst having a high
polymerization activity in a reduced amount of an aromatic
hydrocarbon solvent without using any expensive metallocene
compound.The present inventors have intensively conducted
research with the intention of achieving the above-mentioned
object, and as a result, they have found that when a specific
