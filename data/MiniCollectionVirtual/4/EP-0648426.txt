<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns triglyceride compositions that 
display excellent anti-bloom performance, when applied in 

chocolate. The blends comprise triglycerides A, B and C, 
wherein A is of the (H₂M + M₂H)-type (H= saturated fatty 

acid C₁₆⁺; M= saturated fatty acid C₈-C₁₄);
 

B is a triglyceride composition with less than 30 wt% 
(U₃ + U₂S), U= unsaturated fatty acid C₁₈⁺; S= saturated 

fatty acid C₁₆-C₂₂;
 

B contains more than 40 wt% saturated or unsaturated fatty 
acid residues with a melting point below 60°C, while 

N₂₀ (not stabilised) of B 
<
 40;
 

C is a triglyceride composition with an SUS content of 
≧ 30 wt% and/or having an N₂₀ (not stabilised) 
>

<DESCRIPTION>
As set out in our co-pending European Patent Application 
91 30 60 26.5 (filed July 3, 1991), chocolate compositions 
containing the conventional ingredients, such as cocoa 
powder, cocoa butter, cocoa-butter equivalents, sugar and 
emulsifiers, need to be tempered because of the presence of 
polymorphic fats, such as POP, POSt and/or StOSt (P = 
palmitic acid; St = stearic acid and O = oleic acid). According to the above-mentioned patent application an 
improvement in bloom formation is obtained by adding a 
minimum amount of a hardstock fat to the chocolate 
composition. The hardstock fats used are of the 
(H₂M + M₂H)-type, wherein H = saturated fatty acid having at 
least 16 C-atoms and M = saturated fatty acid having 
C₈-C₁₄ atoms, preferably C₁₂-C₁₄ atoms. Very useful are 
hardstock fats obtainable by interesterification of 
mixtures of vegetable oils high in triglycerides with fatty 
acid residues having at least 16 C-atoms, and triglycerides 
rich in lauric and/or myristic acid residues, e.g. as 
disclosed in our Australian Patent Application 12346/85 
(Serial Number 549,465). Although the results obtained according to the above-mentioned 
European Patent Application are, in general, very 
satisfactory, in particular upon storage above ambient 
temperature, we found that bloom formation still occurred 
upon storage at ambient temperature when these hardstock 
fats were applied at relatively high levels, i.e. above 
1.5 wt.% on product, in particular in dark chocolate 
compositions. It has, however, been found that the 
prevention of bloom at high temperatures is most effective 
when more of the additive is applied. In the past, we also conducted a study in order to find out 
whether we could improve the above results. As a result, we  
 
found a blend of triglycerides which upon application in 
chocolate compositions, or in chocolate-like compositions, 
wherein high amounts of cocoa butter equivalents are 
present, or in baked bakery products, provided with a 
chocolate layer or a chocolate-like layer, or in chocolate 
encapsulated filling led to an improvement of the anti-bloom 
behaviour of the chocolate compositions. This result 
is the subject of our WO 93/01274, according to this 
document triglyceride compositions, comprising 
triglycerides from the types A and B and/or C, wherein A is 
a triglyceride composition of the (H₂M + M₂H)-type, as 
defined above; B is a soft triglyceride composition, having 
a relatively high level of (U₃ + U₂S)-triglycerides and C is 
a vegetable fat or a
