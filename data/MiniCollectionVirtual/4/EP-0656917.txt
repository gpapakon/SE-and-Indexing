<ABSTRACT>
A process for using a polyurethane-based synthetic resin system in which the system consists of an isocyanate component a) and a polyol component b) and auxiliaries and additives c) can be added to the components a) and/or b) and the polyol component b) contains an insufficient proportion of primary or secondary di or polyamines. The system is used to insert and secure roof bolts in boreholes and to that end is preformulated as a two-part system with components a) and b), possibly including auxiliaries and additives c), the components a) and b), possibly including auxiliaries and additives c), the components a) and b) are mixed together shortly before introduction into the boreholes and the mixture spontaneously undergoes an increase in its viscosity to form a gel-like substance which secures the roof bolts in the boreholes and then slowly hardens.
