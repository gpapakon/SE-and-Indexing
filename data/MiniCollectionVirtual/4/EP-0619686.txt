<ABSTRACT>
A mobile telephone location register ML and a subscriber location register SL are provided in a mobile communication network. 
In the mobile location register ML, the zonal position of the mobile telephone MT being in a zone is registered. In the subscriber 

location register SL, the mobile telephone MT which a subscriber SB selects as a receiving terminal is registered. When receiving 
a call to a subscriber, a switching station SW reads out from the subscriber location register SL the identification number 

TID of the mobile telephone which the subscriber registers as the receiving terminal. By using the mobile telephone identification 
number TID, the station reads out from the mobile telephone location register ML the position of the mobile telephone MT, and 

transmits the call to the mobile telephone registered as a receiving terminal in the zonal position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication
control method in a mobile communication system which
enables a subscriber to originate or terminate a call
through any given mobile unit in an arbitrary mobile
communication network through utilization of his personal
number.In the mobile communication, a location register
is provided in the mobile radio communication network and
is covered by a plurality of base stations in the
network. Even if a mobile unit freely moves across a
plurality of areas, its visited area is always updated in
the location register. Hence, when receiving a
terminating call for a mobile unit whichever in the
mobile communication network, a switching center is
capable of terminating the call at its destination unit
by reading out its visited area from the location
register, sending the call to the base station of that
area and transmitting it therefrom to the mobile unit
over a radio channel. With this method, however, users
suffer an inconvenience that they are allowed to receive
terminating calls only by their own mobile units.It is now demanded to implement a mobile
communication system wherein each subscriber registers
his service information with the mobile communication
network whenever necessary and the network effects call
control for the subscriber by referring to his registered
service information to allow him to use an arbitrary
mobile unit for communication. Where the area over which
the mobile communication service is offered is made up of 
a plurality of mobile communication networks by different
service providers, it will be convenient that the
subscriber belonging to one of the mobile radio
communication networks is allowed to originate and
terminate calls in the other networks as well. To meet
this requirement, there has been proposed such a system
as described below. In the following description, the
mobile communication network to which the subscriber
belongs will be referred to as a home network and the
mobile communication network into which the subscriber
moves from the home network will be referred to as a
roaming network.Every mobile unit (a portable telephone or car
phone, for example) receives services specified in the
contract with the company operating the mobile
communication network. To carry out the services, each
mobile unit is assigned a mobile unit identifying number
and various pieces of information on the mobile unit,
similar to those mentioned above, are prestored in the
location register in the network to which the subscriber
belongs. To
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A communication control method for a mobile radio communication system including
a plurality of mobile communication networks (N1-N4), wherein each mobile communication

network (N1-N4) includes at least one switching center (SW1, SW2), a subscriber home location
register (SHL3, SHL4), a subscriber visitor location register (SVL1, SVL2), a mobile unit home

location register (MHL3, MHL4) and a mobile unit visitor location register (MVL1, MVL2), all
location registers being connected to said switching center, said subscriber home location

register (SHL3, SHL4) of each mobile communication network having stored therein subscriber
information and roaming network information of each subscriber using the respective mobile

communication network as its home network, and said mobile unit home location register
(MHL3, MHL4) of each mobile communication network having stored therein roaming network

information of a mobile unit using the respective mobile communication network as its home
network and subscriber identifying information of a subscriber having registered with that mobile

unit for call receiving use, each mobile unit and each subscriber being given a mobile unit
identifying number and a subscriber identifying number of their home networks, respectively,

said method comprising the following steps which are performed when a mobile unit (MT3)
roams from a first mobile communication network (N1) into a second one (N2) and makes a first

location registration in said second mobile communication network, and wherein said mobile unit
(MT3) sends into said second mobile communication network (N2) a location registration request

signal including said mobile unit identifying number of said mobile unit (MT3);

   
characterized in that
(a) said mobile unit visitor location register (MLV2) in said second mobile
communication network (N2) obtains, on the basis of said received location registration request

signal, said roaming network information of said mobile unit (MT3) representing said first mobile
communication network (N1) from said mobile unit home location register (MHL3) of the home

network (N3) of said mobile unit;
(b) said mobile unit visitor location register (MLV2) in said second mobile
communication network (N2) obtains said subscriber identifying number of a respective

subscriber (SB4) having registered with said mobile unit for call receiving use, from said mobile
unit home location register (MHL1) in said first mobile communication network (N1) indicated by

said roaming network information; and
(c) said subscriber visitor location register (SVL2) in said second mobile communication
network (N2) obtains said subscriber information of each subscriber having registered with said

mobile unit (MT3) for call receiving use, from the subscriber home location register in the home
network of the respective subscriber specified by said subscriber identifying number of said

respective subscriber and stores said subscriber information in said subscriber home location
register (SHL2) in said second mobile communication network (N2).
The method of claim 1, wherein step (c) includes the following steps:

(c1) said subscriber visitor location register (SLV2) in said second communication
network (N2) sends a call receiving registration request signal including the subscriber identifying 

number of a respective subscriber registered with said mobile unit (MT3) to a respective
subscriber home location register (SHL4) in the home network (N4) of said respective subscriber

specified by said subscriber identifying number;
(c2) said subscriber home location register (SHL4) in said home network (N4) sends
subscriber contract information and roaming network information of said respective subscriber,

as a response signal, to said subscriber visitor location register (SLV2) in said second
communication network (N2);
(c3) said subscriber visitor location register (SLV2) in said second communication
network stores said subscriber contract information sent thereto and, at the same time, sends a

change information transfer request signal requesting subscriber change information, to the
subscriber visitor location register (SLV1) in said first mobile communication network (N1)

specified by said roaming network information;
(c4) said subscriber visitor location register (SLV1) in said first communication network
(N1) sends said subscriber change information of said respective subscriber to said subscriber

visitor location register (SLV2) in said second communication network (N2); and
(c5) said subscriber visitor location register (SLV2) in said second communication
network stores said sent subscriber change information.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein each communication network (N1-N4)
accommodates a plurality of communication terminals of different communication capabilities; a

terminal class indicating the communication capability of each of said communication terminals is
prestored in said mobile unit home location register (MHL3, MHL4) in each communication

network; and, when a communication terminal performs a communication, said communication
network reads out said terminal class of said communication terminal from said mobile unit home

location register and performs communication processing according to said read-out terminal
class.
