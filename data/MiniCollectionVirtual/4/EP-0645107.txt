<ABSTRACT>
A vertically adjustable support leg includes an outer shaft (12) 
with a tapered axial 

opening (16) and an inner shaft (14) insertable in telescoping fashion 
into the axial 

opening. A tapered two-piece sleeve (30) can be mounted about the inner 
shaft (14) at 

various heights and secures the inner shaft (14) within the axial 
opening of the outer shaft (12) by 

a wedging force provided by the engagement of the sleeve (30) with the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a leg for 
supporting a structure, and more particularly to a 
support leg that is adjustable in the vertical 
direction to easily adjust the height of the structure 
being supported. The support leg can be used to support, for example, a 
table or multiple shelves. The number of legs needed 
to support such structure can vary from one, two, 
three, four, or more, depending on the size, design, 
and shape of the structure and its environment. One aspect of the present invention makes use of a 
mounting assembly of the type disclosed U.S. Patent No. 
3,523,508 (Maslow). The mounting assembly in that 
patent is used in conjunction with an adjustable 
shelving system comprising a formed-wire shelf 
component having a frustoconically shaped collar at  
 
each corner for receiving a support post. Each collar 
tapers outwardly toward its lower extremity when viewed 
in normal use. Generally cylindrical support posts, 
each having a plurality of uniformly spaced annular 
grooves formed in its outer surface, are secured to the 
shelf by the mounting assembly. Each mounting assembly 
comprises at least two separate mounting members which 
are joined about and at least partially surround the 
support post to define a unitary sleeve having an 
complementary frustoconically shaped outer surface. 
Thus, the mounting sleeve is thickest at its bottom 
portion than at its top. The sleeves are sized to fit 
snugly within the shelf collars. An annular rib formed 
on an inside surface of each sleeve is sized to engage 
the annular groove formed on the support post. Vertically adjustable legs for supporting various types 
of structures have been known for many years. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 2,705,119 (Ingwer) discloses a 
pipe support stand that is adjustable in the vertical 
direction. An inner column having a series of spaced 
annular grooves is supported within a hollow outer 
pipe. Steel balls are supported in holes in the outer 
pipe by a ring and serve to secure the inner column by 
engaging one of the annular grooves. The steel balls 
are released from the engaged annular groove by sliding 
the ring to allow the inner column to be vertically 
adjusted. When the inner column is set at the desired 
height the ring is manipulated to bias the steel balls 
into engagement with another annular groove. Another prior art example is provided in a footrest 
mounting assembly disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
3,458,234 (Bates). This patent discloses a 
compressible plastic sleeve
