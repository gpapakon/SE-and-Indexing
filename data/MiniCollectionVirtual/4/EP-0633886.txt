<ABSTRACT>
The pharmaceutically active bicyclic heterocyclic amines (XXX), where W1 is -N= or -CH=; W3 is -N= or -CH=; W5 is -N= or -CR5- with the proviso that W5 is -CR5- when both W1 and W3 are -N= which are useful as pharmaceuticals in treating mild and/or moderate to severe head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequent ischemic stroke, asthma and reduction of mucous formation/secretion in the lung and other diseases and injuries.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heterocyclic amines, many of which are new, and to their
use as pharmaceuticals.WO 87/01706, WO 87/07895, WO 88/08424 and WO 88/07527 disclose
substituted amino type compounds which are useful for treating the same diseases and
injuries as those of the present invention.WO 92/02500 discloses 2-phenylindole derivatives useful for treating asthma,
allergic disorders, thrombosis and ischaemia.J. Heterocyclic Chem. 24:425 (1987) discloses pyrrolopyrimidines substituted at
the pyrimidine moiety by amino groups.WO 91/04254 discloses pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines where any substituents on the
pyrrole ring are simple. In two of the positions the groups are H, halogen or alkyl. In
the third, it is H, alkyl or aralkyl.Venugopalan et al, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 25:1633 (1988), discloses 6,7-dimethoxypyrimido[4,5-b]indoles
as potential antihypertensive agents. The disclosed
compounds include 6,7-dimethoxy-2,4-di(1-piperidinyl)-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indole and
6,7-dimethoxy-2,4-di(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indole.A first aspect of the present invention is the use defined in claim 1. A second
aspect is novel compounds, as defined in claim 2.Compounds (XXX) of the invention are amines and, as such, form acid addition
salts when reacted with acids of sufficient strength. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts
include salts of both inorganic and organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts
are preferred over the corresponding free amines since they produce compounds which
are more water-soluble and more crystalline. The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable
salts include salts of the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric,
nitric, citric, methanesulfonic, CH3-(CH2)n1-COOH or HOOC-(CH2)n1-COOH where n1
is 0 to 4, above, HOOC-CH=CH-COOH or ϕ-COOH. For other acceptable salts, see
Int. J. Pharm., 33, 201-217 (1986). Hydrochloride, hydrobromide, maleate and
methanesulfonate salts are most preferred.It is preferred that -NR2-1R2-2 is the same as -NR4-1R4-2. It is preferred that R2-1
and R2-2 are taken together with the attached nitrogen atom to form 1-pyrrolidinyl, 1-piperazinyl,
1-thiomorpholinyl or 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl; it is more preferred that R2-1 
and R2-2 form 1-pyrrolidinyl or 1-piperazinyl. It is preferred that R7 is -H, -CH3, -ϕ, 2-(1-morpholinyl)ethyl
or 2-(1-piperazinyl)ethyl.The starting point in the synthesis of the pharmacologically active heterocyclic
amines (XXX) is the halogenated pyrimidine ring. Before forming the second ring, the
final desired

<CLAIMS>
Use of a compound for the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating/preventing

diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammation (dermatological anti-inflammatory and anti-psoriasis
agents), emphysema, cancer (limit metastasis, limit tumour growth), (stress-induced) ulcers,

ischemia, or migraine headaches, or in ophthalmology, e.g. in treatment of diabetic retinopathy, age-related

macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma, light-induced retinal damage and in irrigation
mixtures used in eye surgery, in treating subarachnoid haemorrhage and subsequent cerebral

vasospasm, global cerebral ischemia, and in preventing post-ischemic brain damage, brain tumour
(neuroprotective), Bells Palsy, other degenerative neurological disorders, hepatic necrosis (e.g. from

viral hepatitis), radiation damage (for example during radiation treatment or from accidental
exposure to radiation), myocardial damage after myocardial isehemia, pre-birth infant strangulation

bowel syndrome, damage following cardiopulmonary resuscitation, neurological or cardiovascular

surgery and from cardiac infarction, or ocular damage after ophthalmic surgery (e.g. cataract
