pipe structure (12) which consists of a cooling fluid introduction member (29), 

an elongated pipe type annealing member (30), a fluid discharge member (31) 
and a heating member (32) arranged in the mentioned order from the upper side, 

and which has a through bore (33) in the central portions of these members, 
is provided so that the axes of these through bores are aligned with that of a

member (29), passed through the annealing member (30) and discharged from 

the fluid discharge member (31), and it is not sent to the heating member (32). 
Consequently, the wire is cut necessarily in the heating member, and receives

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wire electric discharge
machine having an automatic wire feeding function and a
disconnection recovery function.In wire electric discharge machines, a wire is
guided along upper and lower wire guides arranged above
and below a workpiece, respectively, and electric
current is supplied to the wire to produce an electric
discharge between the wire and the workpiece, thereby
cutting the workpiece. This type of wire electric
discharge machine has an automatic wire feeding function
and a disconnection recovery function.The automatic wire feeding operation includes
cutting the wire when one machining operation is
completed, removing the leading or forward part of the
cut wire with respect to the direction of travel of the
wire, and passing the trailing or rear part of the cut
wire through a machining start hole provided for the
subsequent machining operation from a distal end
thereof.According to the disconnection recovery operation,
when an abnormal electric discharge occurs during
machining operation and the wire is disconnected at the
point of such discharge, an upstream portion of the
disconnected wire damaged by the abnormal discharge is
cut off, and the wire (having the thus-cut end as a
leading end) is fed to the workpiece.Thus, both the automatic wire feeding operation and
the disconnection recovery operation involve forced 
cutting of the wire. The wire can be cut in two ways:
One method is a current-supply cutting, in which the
wire is tensed, and electric current is supplied to the
tensed part of the wire to produce Joule heat there,
thereby cutting the wire.
Examples of such cutting are provided by EP-A-0
220 436 and JP-A-4-331 022. 
The other method is to shear the wire using a cutter.
US-A-4,778,972 employs a mechanical cutter, and utilizes
the application of heat also.
Where the current-supply
cutting is employed, the cut end of the wire is free
from burr, and since the portion of the wire to which
electric current is supplied is annealed due to Joule
heat, the annealed portion becomes straight. That is,
although the wire tends to coil up, the cut end portion
of the wire can be restored to its original shape due to
the annealing effect. The cutting process also causes
the cut end portion of the wire to be slightly reduced
in diameter, thereby making it easier to feed the wire
in the subsequent stage. For these reasons, the current-supply
cutting method provides better effect than
the shearing method using a cutter.In the conventional current-supply cutting method,
howe
