<ABSTRACT>
An electric arc plasma torch is disclosed comprising a housing (1) with an axially mounted nozzle anode (2) and cathode (4) 
and a reservoir (6) for the working liquid packed with a moisture-absorbing material (7). A connecting unit (5) which connects 

the housing with the reservoir is filled with a porous heat-conducting material (8). The liquid absorbed by this material 
evaporates and the vapour enters the discharge chamber via the ring channels (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric-arc low-temperature plasma 
generators, i.e., plasma torches which can find application in mechanical 
engineering, automotive industry, aircraft, electrical-engineering, and some 
other industries for the various kinds of plasma treatment, such as cutting, 
welding, and heat treatment of surface of diverse materials. More specifically this invention relates to those low-temperature plasma 
generators (plasma-arc torches) which make use of steam as a working 
medium (see, for example, JP-A-56 036 375). JP-A- 56 036375 discloses a plasma cutting torch with a cooling water path provided 
within a nozzle electrode provided in opposition to an second electrode, and its water 
discharge port is opened in the same direction as plasma arc. Porous metal such as 
sintered metal is filled in the cooling water path around the nozzle hole. The cooling 
water flowing in the cooling water path cools the nozzle electrode and at the time 
when it passes the sintered metal, part thereof is evaporated and is spouted from the 
water discharge port by becoming the mixed flow of high temperature water and 
steam. This steam flow is further evaporated by the plasma arc spouted from the 
nozzle hole, and the energy density of the plasma arc is increased by this mixed fluid 
and the cut end of cutting material is cooled. Known in the art are plasma generators, wherein steam is used as a working 
medium, which can be supplied to the generator from a special source, or be 
produced immediately in the generator due to high temperatures. The steam 
generation process can be combined with heat abstraction from the electrodes. A widespread solution of the problem aimed carrying out said process is 
supplying the vaporizable fluid through passages in the electrodes, said fluid 
vaporizing while flowing along said passages, simultaneously cooling the 
electrodes (PCT/FI 88/00427; SU, A, 1,620,032). Control over the operating modes of low-temperature plasma generators, 
triggering mode inclusive, may be carried out by diverse methods. The most 
widely used method is adjusting the power of the supply source. Another 
method resides in control of the rate of working medium flow (FR, A, 2 
,045,865;DE, A1, 3,810,620).  
 The present invention makes use of a method for control over the plasma 
torch operating modes by changing the interelectrode gap. The method is a 
well-known one and can be carried into effect by a number of solutions. In one 
of such solutions the cathode is connected to the

<CLAIMS>
An electric-arc plasma torch, comprising a body (1) with a discharge 
chamber (11), both being arranged coaxially with an outlet nozzle-anode (2) and 

a rod-shaped centrally located cathode (4) fixed in a holder (3), 
a container (6) for a working fluid, 

said container being connected to the body (1) and being filled with a moisture-absorbing 
material (7), and the joint between the body (1) and the container (6) 

is filled with a porous heat-conducting material (8) which contacts, on the side 
of the container (6), the moisture-absorbing material (7) found in the container 

(6), and on the side of the body (1), a ring (9) made of a heat-conducting 
material and provided with passages (10) opening into a discharge chamber (11), 

said ring being in contact with the nozzle-anode (2).  
 
An electric-arc plasma torch according to Claim 1, CHARACTERIZED in 
that the container (6) is connected to the body (1) through a sleeve (5) filled with 

a porous material inside which the heat-conducting cathode-holder (3) runs. 
An electric-arc plasma torch according to Claim 1 or 2, CHARACTERIZED 
in that the cathode-holder (3) is enclosed in an electroinsulating tube (12) which 

in turn is placed in a tube (13) made of a heat-conducting material, both of the 
tubes (12) and (13) passing through the body (1) and the container (6). 
An electric-arc plasma torch according to Claim 3, CHARACTERIZED in 
that the cathode-holder (3) is axially movable in the electroinsulating tube (12) 

and is provided with a mechanism for imparting an intermittent motion thereto

a working gap between the anode and the cathode. 
An electric-arc plasma torch according to Claim 4, CHARACTERIZED in 
that the mechanism for imparting motion to the cathode-holder (3) appears as a 

lid (14) arranged coaxially thereto and movable in a thread with respect to the 
torch, said lid having a center hole, wherein a button (16) is accommodated,  

 
said button being spring-loaded, connected to the cathode-holder, and 

electrically insulated therefrom, and also having a flange resting upon an inner 
wall of said lid.
