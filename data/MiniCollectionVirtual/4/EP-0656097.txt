<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid pumps; more 
particularly, the invention relates to liquid pumps 
adapted for pumping liquids having extremely high solids 
content. Liquid pumps have long been used for pumping liquids 
of varying viscosities, including very low viscosity oils 
and paints, and medium to high viscosity liquids which 
have a rather slow flow characteristic. In a case of 
paints and other coating materials it is typical for 
liquid pumps to handle such materials having a solids 
content in the range of 30%-40%. However, when the 
solids content of such materials exceeds about 40% the 
pumping problem becomes more difficult, and special 
handling problems have to be taken into account. Liquid 
materials having higher solids content tend to build up 
and accumulate within the pump and can seriously degrade 
pumping efficiency, even to the point of disabling the 
pump from effective operation. It is necessary to 
frequently disassemble the pump components for cleaning, 
so as to remove accumulated solids from adhering to the 
various components on the interior of the pump and to 
return the pump to normal operating efficiency. Such 
pumps therefore require frequent maintenance intervals, 
wherein the pump must be removed from operation and 
disassembled for cleaning. A particular problem in the pumping of high solids 
content materials has been the tendency of the solid 
particulates in the pumped material to build up or "pack" 
along portions of the interior walls of the pumping 
cylinder. One area where this problem has been noticed 
is in the region immediately adjacent the intake valve of 
the pump, which frequently has a void or recess which 
tends to be outside of the flow path of the liquid  
 
flowing through the pump. Solid particulate matter which becomes lodged in this region 
is not influenced by the material flow through the pump, and therefore it tends to 
accumulate along the interior pump walls and to gradually pack the walls with increasing 
amounts of material. As this build-up increases it can degrade the operating efficiency 
of the pump, and in extreme cases can even disable the pump from further operation. It would be a significant advantage in the art to provide a liquid pump for 
pumping high solids content materials wherein the solids content may range from 70%-80%, 
and wherein the frequency of maintenance intervals may be reduced in order to 
permit the pump to continue in operation for longer time periods. Modern coating materials having high solids content
