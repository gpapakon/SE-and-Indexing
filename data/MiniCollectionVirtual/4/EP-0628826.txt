<ABSTRACT>
A current measurement shunt comprising a measuring resistor (1) mounted on an insulated metallic substrate (2-3) between blocks (6-7) positioned so as to receive the supply leads (12-13) to the shunt, in which the contact blocks (6-7) are positioned so that they are placed between the leads (12-13) and the insulated metallic substrate (2-3) and in which means (8-11) are provided for holding the leads (12-13) tightly against the blocks (6-7). Application to electric cars.
