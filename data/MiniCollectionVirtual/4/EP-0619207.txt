<ABSTRACT>
A restraining device for an animal comprises safety 
belt receiving means (12) adapted to receive a safety 

belt (11) in a vehicle. The device also comprises a 
securing means (22) to secure the device to the animal, 

and attaching means (18,116) to attach the safety belt 
receiving means to the securing means. A harness is also 

provided which comprises first and second webbings 
(42,44,62,64). At least one of the first and second 

webbings is adapted to pass in front of the front legs of 
an animal on its underside, and at least one of the first 

and second webbings is adapted to pass behind the front 
legs of the animal on its underside. The harness also 

includes a securing portion (54,74) to secure the harness 
to a suitable restraining device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to restraining devices for 
use in vehicles. More particularly, but not exclusively, 
this invention relates to restraining devices for animals 
such as dogs. If it is desired to transport animals, for example 
dogs in cars, it is often necessary to provide a suitable 
cage in which the dog can be placed during the journey. 
This can cause distress to the animal. Alternatively, if 
the dog is allowed to remain free within the car a hazard 
to safety could arise in the event that the dog should 
distract the driver. Specification No. WO 88/00540, 
comprising the features defined in the preamble of claim 1, 
discloses a 
protective or holding device for restraining small 
animals, especially dogs, in motor vehicles. 
Specification No. US 2909154 discloses a tethering strap 
arrangement for animals. It is an object of this invention to obviate and/or 
mitigate the disadvantages of the prior art. According to one aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a restraining device for an animal, said 
restraining device comprising safety belt receiving means 
adapted to receive a safety belt in a vehicle, securing  
 
means to secure the device to an animal and attaching 
means to attach the safety belt receiving means to the 
securing means, characterised in that the safety belt 
receiving means is in the form of a split ring having 
first and second end portions, whereby the safety belt 
can be passed between said first and second end portions 
to be received in the space defined by the ring, the ring 
being substantially triangular in configuration, and 
wherein the first and second end portions overlap each 
other and are substantially linear, whereby both of said 
end portions extend substantially across the length of 
one side of the triangle, and said attaching means being 
arranged on the ring opposite said first and second end 
portions. The attaching means may comprise a sleeve mounted 
on the ring, the sleeve being adapted to hold the 
securing means thereon. Preferably, the attaching means 
is adapted to secure the securing means to the safety 
belt receiving means such that the securing means is 
prevented from moving along the safety belt receiving 
means. Preferably, the sleeve is formed of an 
elastomeric material. The sleeve may be adapted to hold 
a part of the securing means between the sleeve and the 
safety belt receiving means. Preferably, the sleeve has 
a cut out portion to allow said part of the securing  
 
means to be received between the sleeve and the safety
