<ABSTRACT>
A speed indicator includes a stationary member (5) fixed to a handlebar of 
a bicycle, a takeup element (7) supported by the stationary member to be 

rotatable about a first axis (X) for taking up a control cable, a shift lever 
(4) for rotating the takeup element, and a pointer (9) pivotable about a 

second axis (P) fixed to the stationary member. The pointer overlaps the 
takeup element as viewed in a direction along the first axis. The speed 

indicator further includes an indicating section for cooperating with the 
pointer for indicating a speed stage selected by operation of the shift 

lever. The takeup element has a projection (12) engaged with a slot formed 
in the pointer for causing the pointer to pivot in response to rotation of 

the takeup element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speed indicator for a shifting device of a 
bicycle having a plurality of speed stages. A conventional shifting device includes a disk forming a takeup element for 
winding a speed control cable, and this disk has an arrow acting as a pointer. When 
a shifting operation is carried out, the arrow is swung to indicate a selected speed 
stage. In such a conventional shifting device, the pointer is attached to the takeup 
element to be operable therewith. When, for example, the shifting device is reduced 
in size, the takeup element has a reduced outer configuration. Then, even when the 
takeup element rotates from a minimum speed stage to a maximum speed stage, the 
pointer is operable only through a very short stroke. This results in an inconvenience 
that speed indicating marks must he arranged at slight intervals along a moving 
track of the pointer. Further, in certain types of shifting device, the takeup element must have 
different angles of rotation, such that the takeup element is rotatable through different 
angles for shifting from a first speed stage to a second speed stage and for shifting 
from the second speed stage to a third speed stage. In such a case, the pointer also 
is movable through different angles, which results in an inconvenience of having to 
arrange the speed indicating marks at varied intervals along the moving track of the 
pointer.  
 In US-PS 3,633,437 an indicating apparatus for a change gear mechanism 
of a bicycle in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 
is shown having a driven means being rotatable 
for rotating a wire connected with the change gear mechanism. 
The control device further comprises a disk plate 
marked with an arrow for indicating the selected gear. The 
arrow can be seen through an aperture. This control device 
results in the drawback that sand and dust can be introduced 
through the aperture and reduce the service life of the 
control device.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a speed indicator having a simple 
construction to indicate rotational displacements of a takeup element in an amplified 
manner, while allowing a reduction in size of the device. It is another object of the invention to provide a speed indicator which enables 
speed indicating marks to he arranged equidistantly as necessary, even if a takeup 
element is rotatable through different angles for establishing different speed stages. The above objects are fulfilled by an indicating apparatus in 
accordance with claim 1. In the
