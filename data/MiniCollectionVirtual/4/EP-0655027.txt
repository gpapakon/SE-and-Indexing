<ABSTRACT>
A wet-shaving razor unit of the flexible design having a shaving aid attached to its cap portion for lubricating the skin during shaving. The shaving aid is formed with at least one groove extending in a direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of flexing of the blade support. The inclusion of at least one groove reduces the resistance of the shaving aid to flexing, thereby enabling the flexible razor unit to more readily follow the contour of the surface being shaved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shaving aid for a
flexible wet-shaving razor unit and, more particularly, to
an improved shaving aid having at least one groove to
enhance the flexing of the shaving aid in response to
forces encountered during shaving.Various types of shaving aids are known in the razor
industry. One popular type of shaving aid contains at
least one water insoluble polymeric matrix, along with a
water soluble material which exudes out of the insoluble
matrix upon contact with water during shaving.In the past, shaving aids have been attached to
various parts of a wet-shaving razor unit. For example,
shaving aids have been mechanically attached to the cap
portion of the razor unit. Shaving aids have also been
mechanically attached forward of the blade cutting edge,
e.g., on the guard bar.Today, the use of flexible wet-shaving razor units,
such as disposable razors and cartridges, has become quite
common. These flexible razor units, such as the ones
disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Patent No. 4,854,043 and
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/563,926 filed on
August 7, 1990, represent a significant advance in the
shaving field. In particular, the flexible razor unit
flexes in response to forces encountered during shaving,
thereby enabling the razor unit to conform to the natural
contour of the surface being shaved. In turn, this brings
a greater portion of the blade(s) into effective, cutting
contact with the surface being shaved.Until now, there has been a need in the art for a
shaving aid suitable for attachment to a razor unit of the 
flexible design. In this regard, the shaving aids of the
prior art, if attached to a flexible razor unit, would
substantially reduce, if not eliminate, the flexibility of
such unit. This reduction in flexibility would limit the
effectiveness of the razor unit. There is therefore a
need in the art for a shaving aid capable of attachment to
a flexible wet-shaving razor unit without reducing the
flexibility of such unit.WO 92/06827 discloses an flexible razor unit having at least one
blade with an exposed edge comprising a flexible blade support
with blade retainers spaced from one another for supporting said
exposed blade, said flexible blade support designed to flex
along at least one axis in response to forces encountered during
shaving and a shaving aid located between blade retainers. US-A-4,854,043 discloses an essentially unitary, flexible razor unit.
However, this document does not address the problem of devising a
shaving aid for use with such a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A flexible wet-shaving razor unit (10) having at least one blade (20;21) with an
exposed edge comprising:


a flexible blade support (30) for supporting said exposed blade, said
flexible blade support being designed to flex along at least one axis in response

to forces encountered during shaving;
a shaving aid (90) having at least one active ingredient, said shaving aid being
attached to said flexible blade support (30) and having at least one groove (95)

extending in a direction substantially perpendicular to said axis of flexing
for enhancing the ability of said shaving aid to flex in response to said

forces, whereby the blade support includes at least two blade retainers (30) spaced
from one another, the spacing between the retainers providing a location datum

for said at least one groove.
The razor unit according to claim 1, wherein said flexible blade
support (30) is a substantially continuous thermoplastic body in which said

blade (20;21) is secured substantially rigidly against movement and vibration
during shaving.
The razors unit according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said flexible
blade support (30) includes at least two blade platforms (60), at least one

corrugation (65) between said at least two blade platforms, and a plurality of
discrete blade retainers (30) integrally formed with said blade support and

disposed above and adjacent to said blade.
The razor unit according to claim 3, wherein said shaving aid (90)
extends continuously between at least two of said blade retainers.
The razor unit according to claim 3 or 4, wherein said at least one
groove (95) is positioned between said blade retainers (30). 
The razor unit according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said shaving aid (90) is chemically bonded to said flexible blade

support (30).
The razor unit according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said active ingredient is polyethylene oxide.
The razor unit according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said axis is parallel to said exposed edge.
A method for forming a flexible razor head comprising the steps of:

positioning at least one blade (20;21) having an exposed edge in a first
mold cavity;
injecting a thermoplastic material into said first mold cavity to form
a flexible blade support (30) around said blade (20;21), said flexible blade support being

designed to flex along at least one axis in response to forces encountered
during shaving;
removing at least a portion of said first mold cavity;
defining a second mold cavity wherein said second mold cavity is
defined by at least a portion of said flexible blade support; and
injecting a second polymeric material having at least one active
ingredient into said second mold cavity and forming a shaving aid (90) attached

to said flexible blade support having at least one groove (95) extending in a
direction substantially perpendicular to said axis of flexing, whereby

the blade support includes at least two blade retainers (30) spaced from another, the
spacing between the retainers providing a location datum for said at least one groove.
The method according to claim 9, wherein said flexible blade
support is formed with at least two blade platforms (60), at least one

corrugation (65) between said at least two blade platforms (60), and a plurality of
discrete blade retainers (30) integrally formed with said blade platforms and

disposed above and adjacent to said blade (20;21). 
The method according to claim 10, wherein said shaving aid (90) is
formed such that it extends continuously between at least two of said blade

retainers (30).
The method according to any one of claims 9 to 11, wherein said
positioning step includes positioning two blades (20;21) in said first mold cavity.
The method according to any one of claims 9 to 12 wherein said
shaving aid (90) is molded in a second mold cavity which is remote from said

first mold cavity.
