<ABSTRACT>
A method of making an acridinium derivative luminesce by reacting the same with a superoxide anion; and a method of 
detecting a test material by detecting the light emitted by the reaction of an acridinium derivative used as a label with a superoxide 

anion. It is possible to conduct the reaction not under strongly alkaline conditions but under nearly neutral conditions and to 
attain a stable and intense luminescence for long.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light emitting method
of an acridinium derivative by reacting a superoxide anion
(O2-) with the acridinium derivative and to a method of
detecting a substance to be examined, utilizing a light
emitted from the acridinium derivative as a label.Along with the progress in diagnostic or medical
technology, various methods of detection of particular
substances contained in very minute quantities in serum and
other biological specimens have been developed and put into
use for enabling the early discovery of various diseases and
for confirming the effects of therapy. The particular
substances to be examined are, for example, various types of
proteins, nucleic acids, drugs, and other biological
substances. For the purpose of quantitative or qualitative
examination of the same, a label as a signal generating source
is attached in advance to substances having affinity with such
particular substances to be examined, for example, antibodies
and antigens where the substance to be examined is a protein;
complementary nucleic acids where the substance to be examined
is a nucleic acid; and an antibody where the substance to be
examined is a drug. The labeled substance having affinity
with the substance to be examined and the sample containing
the substance to be examined are brought into contact with
each other to produce a conjugate of the substance to be
examined and the labeled substance having affinity therewith.
Then, the conjugate is separated by various methods, the
signal generating source of the label is activated, and the
signal is detected by various means. As a result, the amount
or the existence of the substance to be examined can be
determined. Numerous substances have been developed and supplied for
practical use as such a labeling substance, for example,
radioactive substances, fluorescent substances, enzymes, or
metal colloids. In recent years, however, the
chemiluminescence method using an acridinium derivative has
drawn attention in view of its high sensitivity. Strong
luminescence of the acridinium derivative can be generated by
reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under strong alkaline
conditions (EP-A- 82 636 etc.)An attempt has also been made to electrochemically emit
light from the acridinium derivative (Anal. Chem. 64, 1140,
1992). According to this report, acridinium derivatives are
electrochemically inert, but when a potential of -1.0V (vs.
Ag/AgCl) is applied to the electrode under alkaline conditions
(pH = 12), the dissolved oxygen is reduced to produce
