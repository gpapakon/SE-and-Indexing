<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for the preparation of uniform colloidal particles of ferrites, containing manganese (II), for example MnFe2O4, at a relatively low temperature in the presence of an aminodextran solution which acts as a support vehicle for the nucleation and growth of colloidal particles of metal oxide and for dispersion as separate single particles. Monodispersed metal ferrite particles have magnetic properties that are useful for manufacturing transformers, inductors, and audio and video recording heads. The ferrite particles may also be used as specific cell surface markers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IN SITU USE OF GELATIN IN THE PREPARATION OF UNIFORM FERRITE PARTICLESRELATED INVENTION This application is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. Serial No. 07/532,432 filed June 4, 1990 for "IN SITU USE OF GELATIN IN THE PREPARATION OF UNIFORM FERRITE PARTICLES".TECHICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to a method for the preparation of metal oxide particles. More specifically, this invention is directed to an improved method for preparing uniform colloidal ferrite particles containing manganese(II), zinc(II), mixed manganese(II)-zinc(II), iron(II), barium(II), cobalt(II) or nickel(II). The particles of this invention are formed at a relatively low temperature in the presence of gelatin which acts as a vehicle for their nucleation and growth and for their dispersion into separate single particles of uniform size and shape.BACKGROUND ART The invention is directed to overcoming the problem associated with obtaining well-dispersed colloidal particles of uniform size and shape of ferrites containing manganese(II), zinc(II), mixed manganese(II)- zinc(II), iron(II), barium(II), cobalt(II) or nickel(II). Colloidal particles of manganese(II) and zinc(II) or mixed manganese(II)-zinc(II) ferrites of uniform shape and size have not previously been reported. The invention provides a method of preparation of magnetic metal oxide particles in the presence of a polymer, solubilized in an aqueous medium wherein the colloidal particles of ferrites containing manganese(II), zinc(II), mixed manganese(II)-zinc(II), iron(II), barium(II), cobalt(II) and nickel(II), are of a well-defined and uniform shape and size and are dispersed as single particles in an aqueous media. 

 Ferrites containing manganese and/or zinc in fine particle form represent an important class of ferrimagnetic materials. Most preparations of manganese ferrites have been carried out at high temperatures5 (1000-2000°C) from solid solutions to produce large crystallites [German Patent, DE 3619746 Al, JapanesePatents, JP 8791423 A2 and JP8791424 A2] . Lower temperature (350°C) decomposition of a mixed Mn-Fe oxalate, followed by reduction with H /H 0, gave a10 polycrystalline powder which was characterized as a solid solution of Fe 0 and MnFe 0 . Low temperature methods3 4 2 4 assure crystallization of manganese ferrite in the spinel structure as ferrimagnetic fine particles [R. Bendaoud et al., IEEE Trans. Magnetics, MAG-23: 3869-3873 (1987)].■■■•-**• Notable progress in obtaining monodispersed magnetite and ferrite (Co , Ni ) particles has been made
