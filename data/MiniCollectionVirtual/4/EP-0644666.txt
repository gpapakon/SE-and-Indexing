<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medium-frequency
radio transmission system for enabling to
listen to an AM medium-frequency radio within broadcast
wave closed areas such as underground shopping malls,
underground parking lots, underground connection
passage, underground railways, automobile road tunnels
or deep spaces of massive buildings (hereinafter
referred to as "tunnel" or "basement" for the sake of
explanation).In case of receiving an AM radio wave at the
rooftop of an existing high-storied building and
transmitting the received radio wave to a basement,
prior art has newly built a coaxial cable for
transmitting a medium-frequency radio from the rooftop
to the basement within the existing building.Moreover, in order to reradiate a wave, there
was required construction work such as a new inductive
line stretched on the wall surface.In the prior art, said construction should be 
executed within the existing building, generally
difficult works were accompanied and a large amount of
expenses were required.US-A-4 476 574 describes a radio communication system for use
in tunnels, mines, buildings or other shielded locations in
which a pair of radiating transmission lines extend through
such location in spaced coextensive relation to each other.
The system described here uses a high frequency in the range
of 150 MHz, 170 MHz for the transmission, as well as a
transmission line of balanced twin lead lines of 300 Ω
together with an interposing of amplifiers of 33 dB gain in
each 800 feet, whereby signals are transmitted in unilateral
direction. In the opposite direction a similar transmission
line is set with a few feet distance between the two
transmission lines, wherein the coupling loss of 45 dB order
is maintained. Thus, a couple of mobile transceivers between
two transmission lines can communicate with each other by
using the two transmission lines in bilateral directions. An
example is described, where the receiving antenna receives a
frequency of 160 MHz from a mobile radio system. The
receiving frequency of another transceiver is 80 MHz and the
transmitting frequency is 72 MHz. In a system for mobile
transceivers in mines by using three frequencies, the system
uses an intermediate frequency of 455 KHz for taking a
translated signal back to the base station from the opposite
end of the transmission lines. Furthermore, this document
describes a single-line transmission system where a feederline
configuration having particular openings in the
transmission line is used for radiation. A balun
