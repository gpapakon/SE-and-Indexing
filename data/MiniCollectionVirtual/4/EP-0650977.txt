<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous emulsions, at least 80% of which have been polymerized, are treated 
by a process which comprises the separate steps of: a) initially treating the 

emulsion with a sufficient amount of a free radical generator in an amount and 
for a time sufficient to reduce the residual monomer content to from 1500 to 6000 

parts per million, and b) subsequently subjecting the emulsion to steam stripping 
under vacuum, without significantly degrading or destabilizing the emulsion, to 

thereby reduce the residual monomer content to from about 5 to 500 parts per 
million.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for minimizing residual monomer
in aqueous polymeric emulsions.Aqueous emulsion polymerization systems are well known for the production
of many types of polymers, for example, the preparation of homopolymers and
copolymers of vinyl acetate. Commercial production of aqueous emulsion polymers
results in products which contain varying amounts of unreacted monomers, for
example, residual vinyl acetate, since it is not currently technically feasible
to carry these polymerization reactions to 100 percent completion. It is thus
desirable to minimize the amount of residual monomers in commercial products
(e.g., latices) for several reasons from environmental, regulatory and/or
economic points of view.In US-A- 4,529,753, hereafter the '753 patent, there is described
a process for minimizing residual monomer in an aqueous polymeric emulsion. The
process involves a simultaneous two-step procedure. The emulsion is subjected
to a steam stripping operation with the simultaneous introduction of a free
radical generating agent until the residual monomer content is not more than 0.05
percent by weight based on the emulsion.The present invention provides an improved process over such prior art
whereby the residual monomer content can be lowered even further in commercially
acceptable batch processing times.The present invention provides a process of treating an aqueous polymeric
emulsion (i.e., latex) of one or more monomers comprising initially treating the
emulsion with a sufficient amount of a free radical generator to thereby reduce
the residual monomer content to from 1500 to 6000 parts per million (ppm) and
preferably from 1900 to 3000 ppm and subsequently subjecting the emulsion to
vacuum/steam stripping at a pressure, flow rate and time period sufficient to 
further substantially remove residual monomer, without significantly degrading
or destabilizing the emulsion. Increased efficiencies with regard to final
residual monomer content are obtained by this stepwise procedure as compared to
the simultaneous procedure of the '753 patent. Final values in the range of
about 5 ppm, or even lower, to 500 ppm have been achieved.As used in this specification, the terms 'aqueous polymeric emulsion",
"steam stripping", "monomer" and "free radical generator" have the same meanings
and scope as in the '753 patent."Steam stripping", or steam distillation, is a well known operation in
chemical engineering procedures, as is its application at lower pressures
(partial vacuum) which serve
