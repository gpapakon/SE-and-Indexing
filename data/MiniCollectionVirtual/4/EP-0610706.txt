<ABSTRACT>
Process for bending a plate (1) of press-formable 
material, comprising the use of a blank-holder means (4) to 

firmly hold the plate on its horizontal plane between 
said blank-holder means and an appropriate anvil (2), and the 

subsequent actuation of a knife-shaped tool (11) to perform 
the bending operation, in which said actuation of said 

knife-shaped tool (11) consists of a first purely 
translational movement and a second purely rotational 

movement, wherein said first purely translational 
movement brings about a first bending by a 90°-angle of 

the edge portion of the plate to be bent, and said second 
purely rotational movement is effective in increasing the 

bending angle to any greater angle than 90°.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new sheet-metal bending 
process for metal plates, in particular to make bends 
with a greater angle than 90° in the butt-end or edge 
portion of sheet-metal plates with an elongated shape, as 
performed preferably by numerical-control (NC) presses, 
as well as the machines arranged to carry out such a 
process. Press-bending is a widely known technology in the 
sheet-metal forming industry, where it is used in much 
the same manner by the various manufacturers, except for 
some minor differences due mainly to various extents of 
automation implemented in the respective manufacturing 
processes. Such a technology is substantially based on the 
following fabrication cycle, which is briefly outlined 
below in order to facilitate a comparison with the cycle 
according to the present invention, which will be 
described further on.  
 Essentially, the sheet-metal bending process is 
carried out in two distinct phases, which consist in 
Placing the sheet-metal plate to be folded on an 
appropriate anvil, which is generally known in the art by 
its name of 'dihedron' and is accordingly provided with 
an angled concavity, and in the downstroke of a plunger 
carrying, duly attached to its downward facing end, an 
appropriately shaped tool, which is generally known in 
the art by its name of 'knife'. In general, such an angled concavity of the dihedron 
and the knife are given such a shape that they are 
capable of fitting together perfectly. The progressively applied pressure of the knife 
against the sheet-metal plate, whereas the dihedron acts 
as an opposing and forming element, brings about the 
desired bending and plastic deformation effect in the 
sheet-metal plate while the latter is clamped by said 
elements, as anyone skilled in the art is well aware of. 
However, the use of this technique is limited to the 
bending of sheet-metal plates being quite small in their 
size. Actually, the following rule-of-thumb applies in 
general: the greater the bending angle, the smaller the 
size of the sheet-metal plate. The problems, therefore, arise when handling larger-sized 
sheet-metal plates and, particularly, when the need 
arises to bend beyond 90°, ie. creating 'undercuts', the 
butt-end or edge portions of elongated-shape sheet-metal 
plates, preferably by means of a single sheet-metal 
bending operation. Actually, it is theoretically possible to bend by such 
a large angle the butt-end or edge portion of a sheet-metal 
plate with a single sheet-metal bending operation.

Bending machine for bending a plate of press-formable 
material, comprising a blank-holder means (4) to firmly hold the 

plate (1) on the horizontal plane between said blank-holder means 
and an appropriate anvil (2), and a knife-shaped tool (11) to 

perform the bending operation, said tool (11) being able to 
perform a first bending phase through a purely translational 

movement and a second bending phase through a combined

mounted on the blank-holder means or lever, with the other of 

said blank-holder means or lever.
