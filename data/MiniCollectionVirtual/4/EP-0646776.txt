<ABSTRACT>
The metering device comprises a housing, defining at least 
one inlet for the material to be metered and at least one 

outlet for that material, and at least one rotatable ball 
(4) driven by a separate shaft (5), said ball having a 

transverse bore (9) containing a shuttling ball (10) moving 
linearly in said bore between two seats (11, 12) and sealing 

against one or other seat. The rotatable ball (4) is 
captured within the seats and sealed under pressure against 

the outlet seat (8). 
Such a metering device allows an exact metering, in shot or 
flow form, has great simplicity of construction with few 

working parts such as that it may easily be placed in a 
pressure transfer system for liquids and gases and acts as 

shut off valve between metering use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metering device for
fluids according to the introduction of claim 1.Such a device is known from EP-A-0 200 961, disclosing a
device and a method for metering fluids, with a rotatable
spherical member comprising at least one bore with a membrane
as metering member.US-A-4 058 240 discloses an automatic drain for compressed
air system with a valve comprising as rotatable valve
member a ball having a not throughgoing bore as cup means
for transporting a liquid.Starting from this prior art, it is the object of the
present invention to provide a metering device which solves,
in a simple manner, the sealing problems of the rotatable
member and can be used for the metering of gases as
well as for a wide range of liquids.This problem is solved with a device as defined in claim 1.
The therein defined solution reduces the sealing problems
considerably and allows a more compact design of the metering
device.In a preferred embodiment the metering member within the
rotatable ball is also a ball.The invention will be explained hereinafter, by way of
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings.
Figure 1 shows schematically a section of a device according
to the invention,Figure 2 shows a section at 90° of Figure 1 of a detail,  Figure 3 shows a section of a second embodiment of the invention, Figure 4 shows a section of a third embodiment of the invention, Figure 5 shows a section of a fourth embodiment of the invention
particularly suited for compressible fluids, Figure 6 shows a section of a further embodiment of the
invention with two metering units, andFigure 7 shows an use of the invention in a layout for a
two component proportioning and mixing apparatus.Figure 1 shows schematically a first embodiment of a metering
device with a housing 1, having an inlet port 2 and
diametrically opposed an outlet port 3. The inlet port is
connected to a supply and the outlet port to a dispensing
apparatus. The metering member is a spherical, rotatable
member, preferable a ball 4 which is coupled to a drive
shaft 5 e.g. by a keyway shaft coupling 33. This shaft is
held in a bearing 6 with an appropriate seal 7. A drive
system such as an electric motor and gear box and the electric
controls for driving the rotatable ball can be
conventional, resp. the same as in the prior art document.It is preferable for the correct function that there is a
spherical seat 8 for the rotatable ball at the outlet side,
forming a seal and which is achieved at less cost and is
more durable and effective than
