<ABSTRACT>
This installation includes a storage tank (10) into which emerge a delivery of washing water from a washing machine (12) and a delivery of mains water, a pipe (2) for treatment and recycling connecting the bottom of the tank (10) to the machine (12) and in which are placed: a pump (26), a mechanical filter (34) and a chemical filter, a device for cooling water, upstream of the chemical filter, and a unit for demineralising (52) water, downstream of the mechanical and chemical filters. The invention applies to the washing of articles, especially in the medical and scientific fields and the field of the manufacture of electronic circuits.

Station for treating and recycling washwater for
a washing machine, characterized in that it comprises:


a storage tank (10) into which a line (16) feeding
washwater from at least one washing machine (12) and

a line (14) feeding mains supply water deliver;
a treatment and recycling line (2) which connects
the bottom of the storage tank (10) to the washing

machine (12) and in which the following are placed:

pumping means (26) for taking in and pressurizing
the water from the storage tank (10);
first means (34) for mechanical filtering and
means (44) for chemical filtering;
water cooling means (40) placed upstream of the
chemical filtering means, and
water demineralization means (52) arranged downstream
of the mechanical and chemical filtering

means, the demineralization mans (52) comprising
at least two demineralizers (54, 56) mounted in

parallel in the treatment and recycling line (2),
means for detecting saturation of the demineralizers,

and valves (58, 60) for isolating each of
them in order to allow their regeneration without

interrupting the operation of the station.
Station according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a screen (62) is placed in the treatment and

recycling line (2), at the outlet of the demineralization
means (52).
Station according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the first means (34) for mechanical

filtering include a first and a second filtering 
cartridge (36, 38), the said first cartridge (36) having

a less fine cutoff capability than the second cartridge
(38).
Station according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the first cartridge (36) has a cutoff capability

substantially equal to 50 µm, while the second cartridge
(38) has a cutoff capability substantially equal to

10 µm.
Station according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the chemical filtering

means comprise an active carbon filter (44).
Station according to Claim 5, characterized in
that second means (48) for mechanical filtering are

placed along the treatment and recycling line (2),
downstream of the chemical filtering means.
Station according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it includes pressure

measurement and control means arranged along the line
(2).
Station according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a pH measurement probe (64)

is placed in the treatment and recycling line, downstream
of the demineralization means.
Station according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a flow meter (50) is placed

in the treatment and recycling line (2).
Station according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the line (14) for feeding

mains supply water includes a normally closed solenoid
valve (18) which is caused to open by a low-level

detector (22) placed in the storage tank.
Station according to Claim 10, characterized in
that it furthermore includes a control unit (32)

including a general switch (72); a control switch for the
pumping means; and an emergency shutdown device (74);

means for controlling the pumping means, the cooling
means and the solenoid valve; error warning lights (70)

for the pumping means and displays (76) for the quality
of the water. 
Station according to Claim 11, characterized in
that it comprises a chassis (1) supporting the storage

tank (10), the control unit (32), and the treatment and
recycling line (2) and the various means placed in this

line.
