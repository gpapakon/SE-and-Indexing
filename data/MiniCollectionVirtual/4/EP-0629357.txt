<ABSTRACT>
A cap body (2) is formed with a support sleeve (10) and an 
arcuate guide projection wall (16) which are concentric with a 

mounting base plate (7). The support sleeve (10) is formed with a 
first notch (12) and a first guide groove (14,15). A first engage 

claw (34,35) is projected from a pivot shaft (33) of a shield plate (4) 
and enters and comes out of the first notch (12). The first guide 

groove (14,15) engages with the first engage claw (34,35) through the 
first notch (12). A lock lever (19) is pivotally supported by the 

mounting base plate (7), and is provided with a first and second lock 
claws (23,24) which engage and disengage with first and second 

engage claws (34,35) in accordance with a locking position and an 
unlocking position of the lock lever (19). Therefore, at the 

attaching and detaching position of the shield plate (4), the 
shield can be locked at least at two points by a single 

lock member and thus, a coupled strength of the shield 
plate is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shield plate
mounting structure in a helmet for mounting a shield plate
to a mounting base plate secured to an outer surface of a
cap body for turning or pivotal movement to open and close
a window in the cap body.There is a conventionally known structure for mounting
a shield plate to a cap body without using machine screws,
which includes a support sleeve formed on an outer side of
a mounting base plate and having a notch in its peripheral
wall and a guide groove in its inner peripheral surface, a
stub shaft capable of being fitted into the support sleeve,
an engaging claw projecting from an outer peripheral
surface of the stub shaft and capable of being brought into
engagement into the guide groove via the notch, the stub
shaft and the lock claws being formed on an inner surface
at an end of a shield plate, and a lock member slidably
carried on the mounting base plate and provided with a lock
claw adapted for engagement and disengagement with and from
the engage claw in the notch in accordance with the a
locking position and an unlocking position of the lock
member, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No.163306/92. In the prior art structure of the above-described type, only one engage
claw and one lock claw are engaged with each other in an attachable and
detachable position of the shield plate.To increase the coupled strength of the shield plate, EP 0 471 906 A1,
from which the preamble part of claim 1 is derived, discloses a shield plate
mounting structure additionally comprising an arcuate guide projection wall
disposed concentrically with and outside the support sleeve and provided at
an outer peripheral surface thereof with a second guide groove. For removing
the shield plate, the first engage claw and the first guide groove can be easily
separated from each other since the lock member can be slidably moved to
release the first engage claw from the support sleeve. However, considerable
forces are necessary to separate the second engage claw from the second
guide groove since these elements need to be resiliently deformed to
disengage from each other. Therefore, apart from the fact that a considerable
effort is necessary for removing the shield plate, there is also a risk that the
second engage claw and the second guide groove are damaged when they are
forcibly separated from each other.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a shield
plate mounting structure in a helmet of the type described above
