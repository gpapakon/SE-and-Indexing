<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of plastic sanitary articles based on polymethyl methacrylate having improved thermal properties by the casting resin process, in which a suspension of the liquid, polymerisable, organic precursor is transferred into a shaping mould and cured in a manner known per se and subsequently demoulded, characterised in that the particulate filler FS is selected from the group consisting of aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium oxide hydrate, magnesium hydroxide and silicon dioxide, with the proviso that the average particle size of the filler particles FS is in the range from 20 to 60  mu m, and that the particles have been silanised by means of a non-ethylenically unsaturated silanising reagent.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing plastic sanitary articles
based on polymethyl methacrylate, with improved thermal

characteristics, using the cast resin method, wherein,
starting from conventional, liquid, polymerisable,

organic precursors (prepolymer PM), while adding 40 to
80 wt.% of a particle-like inorganic filler FS (based on

the total amount of all the materials used), a
suspension is prepared, supplied to a moulding tool,

hardened in a manner known 
per se
 and then removed from
the mould, characterised in that the particle-like

inorganic filler FS is selected from the group
comprising aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide,

aluminium hydroxide hydrate, magnesium hydroxide and
silicon dioxide, with the proviso that the average

particle size of at least 20% of the particles FS used
is within the range of from 20 to 60 Âµm, and that the

particles have been silanised by means of a non-ethylenically
unsaturated silanisation reagent.
