<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thrust reverser for jet 
engines. More particularly, the invention relates to a thrust 
reverser which can be used with or without by-pass of the main 
jet, and which is disposed downstream of the jet exhaust pipe. In order to reduce the landing distance of an aircraft, 
and also to increase the safety factor when the aircraft is 
landing on a wet or icy runway, thrust reversers are used on 
the jet engines in order to produce a braking thrust for 
slowing the craft. Such thrust reversers function to reverse 
the direction of the jet thrust, from a normally rearward 
direction used for propelling the craft, to a forward 
direction for slowing or braking the craft. Thrust reversers are typically formed of reverser doors 
which are hingedly mounted on a fixed structure called a jet 
pipe, and usually form the final nozzle of the gas turbine 
engine. The trailing edge of the reverser doors must be fully 
scarfed in order to enable their deployment by hinged movement 
to a position in which the two doors abut against each other, 
either at their trailing edges or at abutment fittings. French patent 2,348,371 and U.S. patent 4,129,269 
illustrate the non-planar exit area of the nozzle when the 
reverser doors are in the stowed position. This exit area is 
often referred to as a "fish mouth" exit opening because of 
the shape of the opening when viewed from the side. Such a 
"fish mouth" opening is technically considered as non-planar. 
Such a fish-mouth or non-planar opening is commonly used for 
thrust reversers formed by hinged doors. However, experience has shown that this shape rather 
significantly degrades the engine performance in a forward 
thrust mode of operation, and this degradation is caused by 
two combined factors. Firstly, there is a rather significant 
loss of nozzle efficiency because of efflux spillage sideways 
through the cut away portions created by the scarfs. 
Secondly, there is a significant thickness of the trailing  
 
edge of the reverser doors, leading to an excessive base area, 
in turn leading to a non-negligible base drag. In addition, the thrust reversers according to these 
patents significantly change the inner flow lines of the jet 
stream through the engine, since the throat of the nozzle is 
(and must be) located upstream of the trailing edge of the 
reverser nozzle. Also, from the throat to the trailing edge 
of the reverser, the inner skin of the door has a cylindrical 
or divergent extension. Irrespective of the fishmouth exit, 
or the cut

<CLAIMS>
A thrust reverser for use with a jet 
engine, comprising at least two thrust reverser door 

members (10, 12), each of said door members being pivotally 
attached to an attachment member (48) on the jet engine 

pipe (18) so as to be pivotally movable between reversing and 
non-reversing positions, each of said door members having a 

scarfed trailing edge portion (34, 36) so that in said 
reversing position, the trailing edge portions of said door 

members are in abutting contact, characterised by at least 
two half-shells (22, 24), one being associated with and 

surrounding the trailing edge portion of each of said door 
members, said half shells being pivotally attached to said 

attachment member, and said half shells cooperatively 
forming an exhaust outlet having a planar exit area for said jet engine when in 

said non-reversing position. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 1, 
characterised by linkage means (42) connecting each of said 

door members with the associated half-shell so that 
pivoting of said door members causes pivoting of the 

associated half-shell. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 2 and 
wherein the inner skin (30, 32) of said door members forms 

a portion of the jet flow line. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 3, 
characterised in that the pivot points (14, 16) for said 

door members are spaced from the pivot points (26, 28) for 
said half-shells along said attachment member. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 1 and 
wherein said exhaust outlet is strictly convergent. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 5 and 
wherein the throat of said exhaust outlet is located at the 

trailing edge of said exhaust outlet. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 1 and 
wherein said exhaust outlet is convergent-divergent. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 7 and 
wherein the throat of said exhaust outlet is slightly 

upstream of the trailing edge of said exhaust outlet.  
 
A thrust reverser according to one of 
claims 1-8 and wherein the trailing edge portions (34, 36) 

of said door members are in abutment on the centerline of 
said jet pipe when said door members are in said reversing 

position. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 9 and 
wherein said half-shells (22, 24) are positioned aft of 

said door members (10, 12) when said door sections are in 
said reversing position. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 9 and 
wherein said half-shells are positioned away from the 

exhaust gases of said engine when said door sections are in 
said reversing position. 
A thrust reverser as in claim 9 and 
wherein said half-shells are shielded from the exhaust gas 

flow from said engine when said door sections are in said 
reversing position. 
A thrust reverser according to one of 
claims 1-8 and wherein the throat of said exhaust outlet is 

located at the trailing edge of said planar exhaust outlet. 
A thrust reverser according to one of 
claims 1-13, comprisin
g a pair of symmetrical thrust 
reverser door members (10, 12) and a pair of symmetrical 

half-shells.
