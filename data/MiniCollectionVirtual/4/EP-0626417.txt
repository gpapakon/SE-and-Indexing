<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous dispersion
of hydrophobic melamine resin, the dispersion being useful
as a crosslinking agent for aqueous coating compositions and
being excellent in storage stability, thermal stability and
mechanical stability.Aqueous dispersions are known which are prepared by
dispersing in water a hydrophobic melamine resin in the
presence of a water-soluble resin serving as a dispersion
stabilizer. Water-soluble resins useful in the preparation
of the aqueous dispersion include acrylic resins, alkyd
resins, epoxy resins and the like which have hydrophilic
groups, e.g. carboxyl and amino groups. Many of these
resins are of straight-chain structure.However, such aqueous resin dispersions have drawbacks.
The dispersions are markedly decreased in viscosity during
storage at room temperature or elevated temperatures or on
exposure to a mechanical load, consequently tending to cause
sagging or popping, when used for a coating composition.
The dispersions are also disadvantageous in becoming
thickened because of a large amount of the water-soluble
resin used for dispersing in water the hydrophobic melamine
resin. The thickened dispersions are likely to induce
insufficient atomization when used for a spray coating
composition and are therefore undesirable. An object of the present invention is to provide a
novel aqueous resin dispersion free of the drawbacks of
conventional aqueous dispersions of hydrophobic melamine
resins.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a novel aqueous resin dispersion which is excellent in
storage stability, thermal stability and mechanical
stability.These and other objects of the invention will become
more apparent from the following description.According to the present invention, there is provided
an aqueous resin dispersion prepared by dispersing in an
aqueous medium a graft resin (A) and a hydrophobic melamine
resin (B), said graft resin (A) having a weight average
molecular weight of 10,000 to 100,000 and an acid value of
5 to 80, and consisting of a hydrophobic portion
and hydrophilic portion, said hydrophilic
portion being 5,000 to 50,000 in weight average
molecular weight and at least 20 in acid value.The present inventors conducted extensive research to
overcome the drawbacks of conventional aqueous dispersions
of hydrophobic melamine resins and found that when said
specific graft resin is used as a stabilizer for dispersing
the hydrophobic melamine resin, the resulting dispersion is
markedly improved in storage stability,
