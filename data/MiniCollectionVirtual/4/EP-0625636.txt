<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-piece hollow metal component such as a sump at the bottom of a motor vehicle engine including, at its upper part, a rim including a peripheral border, in which rim there are made through-holes for the passage of fastening members, such as tightening screws and a groove for receiving a sealing gasket, the said gasket having, in the region of the passages for the fastening members, a transverse section which is greater than its section at the running length. The rim (2) includes alternation between flat parts (2a) in which the through-holes (6) for the passage of the fastening members are made, and projecting parts (5), the said groove (7) being made between these projecting parts and the peripheral border (4), and the gasket (8, 9) having an asymmetric annular shape (8) in the region of the said flat parts (2a).

<CLAIMS>
Single-piece, hollow metal component, such as a lower crank-case 
(1) for automobile engine, comprising at its upper part a flange 

(2) possessing a peripheral rim (4), in which flange there are 
formed through holes (6) for the passage of fixing elements such 

as tightening screws, and a groove (7) for receiving a seal (8, 
9), said seal (8, 9) having, at the position of the through 

passages for the fixing elements, a cross-section that is 
greater than its section in the running length, characterized by 

the fact that the flange (2) comprises alternations of plane 
parts (2a), in which are formed the through holes (6) for the 

passage of the fixing elements, and projecting parts (5), said 
groove (7) being formed between the latter and the peripheral 

rim (4), and the seal (8, 9) possessing, at the position of said 
plane parts (2a), an asymmetric annular shape (8). 
Hollow metal component according to Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that the projecting parts (5) of said flange (2) are 

situated at a height, relative to the plane parts (2a) of said 
flange (2), greater than that of the top of the peripheral rim 

(4). 
Hollow metal component according to any one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized by the fact that it is made by stamping or 

pressing.
