<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLETHIN FILM DEPOLYMERIZAÎ—ON TO DIMERIC CYCLIC ESTERSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a reduced pressure reactive distillation process for the preparation of dimeric cyclic esters. The process of the invention comprises depolymerizing thin films of an oligomer of a hydroxycarboxylic acid to form a dimeric cyclic ester and recovering the cyclic ester. The thin film process of the invention affords rapid and substantially complete conversion to a dimeric cyclic ester, low hold-up times, little or no decomposition to undesirable by-products, and high quality product in high yields.BACKGROUND OF THE IN VENTTONDimeric cyclic esters of hydroxycarboxylic acids such as glycolide (l,4-dioxane-2,5-dione) and lactide (l,4-dioxane-3,5-dimethyl-2,5-dione), are intermediates to high molecular weight polyhydroxycarboxylic acids which may be useful in biomedical and other applications because of their ability to be degraded biologically and hydrolytically to form physiologically and environmentally acceptable by-products.A process for producing dimeric cyclic esters may be found in Aigner et al, European Patent Application Publication No.264926. Aigner et al., discloses conducting a thermolysis depolymerization reaction continuously in a forced feed flow tube reactor (double screw extruder) under reduced pressure, while maintaining an increasing temperature gradient along its length. The dimeric cyclic ester product distills from the reaction mass through vapor ports located at the downstream end of the reactor, while the higher-boiling residue is extruded under the force-feed extrusion conditions. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved process for converting low molecular weight oligomers or polymers of alpha- hydroxycarboxylic compositions to cyclic esters in short residence times and at high production rates.It is another object of this invention to provide a process wherein the polymer of an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic composition is substantially completely converted to the cyclic ester, with substantially reduced racemization and other undesirable decomposition reactions.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 It is a further object of this invention to provide a process which achieves rapid conversion to the dimeric cyclic ester while minimizing hold-up time in the reactor and exposure of the reaction mass and product to thermal stress. 5SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is based on the discovery that conversion of an oligomer of an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid moiety (e.g., an oligomer of

WHAT IS CLAIMED:
1. An improved process for depolymerizing an oligomer of an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid composition to a dimeric cyclic ester, the improvement comprising depolymerizing a thin liquid film of the oligomer at an effective depolymerization temperature and at a reduced pressure sufficiently low to vaporize the cyclic ester and form a vapor composition and collecting the resulting vapor composition.
2. The process of Claim 1 wherein (a) a molten oligomer is continuously fed to a reaction zone, and disposed as a thin film having a thickness of from about .05 to about 1.0 mm on an evaporation surface, whereby the oligomer comprising the film is depolymerized continuously and vaporized and the vapor is collected,
3. The process of Claim 2 wherein the feed rate of the oligomer to the reaction zone, the rate of disposing the thin film of the oligomer on the evaporation surface, the thickness of the film, the temperature and the pressure are coordinated and controlled such that the depolymerization proceeds substantially completely to form the vaporized composition containing the dimeric cyclic ester.
4. The process of Claim 1 wherein the depolymerization is effected in a thin film evaporator.
5. The process of Claim 4 wherein the evaporator is a wiped-film evaporator.
6. A process according to any one of Claims 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 wherein the oligomer comprises an oligomer of lactic acid or an oligomerizable ester or nitrogen base salt thereof and the dimeric cyclic ester is a lactide.
7. The process of Claim 6 wherein the oligomer is an oligomer of lactic acid.

2) maintaining the evaporation surface at said effective temperature and the reaction zone at said reduced pressure,
3) flowing liquid ohgomer from said ohgomer feed means and along the evaporation surface while wiping the ohgomer with said wiping means so as to form a thin film over the evaporation surface,
4) condensing the resulting vapor composition containing the cyclic ester on the condensing means,
5) recovering unconverted oligomer from step(3) from the lower region of the evaporation surface, and; 6) recovering the cyclic ester from the condensate of step(4).
11. An apparatus for producing a dimeric cyclic ester comprising: a first means for converting lactic acid to polylactic acid, a second means connected to the first means for depolymerizing the polylactic acid to form a product comprising lactide, wherein said second means comprises a wiped-film evaporator,
