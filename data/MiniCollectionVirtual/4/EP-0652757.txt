<ABSTRACT>
Water-dispersible sugar-free powdered, bulk laxative compositions containing cellulose ethers as the active agent are disclosed. These bulk laxative compositions form smooth, palatable dispersions in water which dispersions contain a therapeutically effective amount of the cellulose ether.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sugar-free, dry mix cellulose
ether bulk laxative compositions.It has been long known that cellulose ethers, such as
carboxymethylcellulose and methylcellulose are effective
bulk laxatives. The cellulose ethers relieve-constipation
by increasing the bulk of the stool, increasing the water
content of the stool, and it is believed, by a lubricating
effect on the stool.Previously, cellulose ethers have been administered as
bulk laxatives in the form of tablets, powders, and
suspensions in highly concentrated sugar solutions. Each
of these methods of administration has significant
disadvantages which have limited the acceptance of these
products by consumers.Tableted cellulose ethers, for example, do not readily
dissolve in the digestive tract because these cellulose
ethers are highly hygroscopic. The outer portion of the
tablet quickly forms a gel-like hydrate which prevents
break up of the tablet and greatly retards hydration of the
interior portions of the tablet. Accordingly, the tablet
is often excreted as an intact soft gel mass. Although
some laxative effect is produced by such gel masses, the 
cellulose ether is most effective when dispersed-uniformly
throughout the stool. Thus, when employed in tablet form,
cellulose ethers have reduced efficacy as bulk laxatives.Cellulose ethers have also been administered as
powders, which powders are swallowed by the patient. Such
powders often exhibit the same type of gelation as tablets,
i.e., the individual particles lump together and remain
partially undissolved as they pass through the digestive
tract. Moreover, administration of cellulose ethers in
powder form has caused nausea, cramping, and vomiting in
some patients. Accordingly, cellulose ethers are not
advantageously administered in powder form.Cellulose ethers have also been administered as bulk
laxatives as suspensions of the cellulose ether in water
containing high concentrations of sucrose or other sugars
and a flavoring. The sugar competes with the cellulose
ether for the available water, thereby preventing the
cellulose ether from hydrating sufficiently to form gels.
The administration of cellulose ethers in such form has the
advantage that the cellulose ether is sufficiently
dispersed that it does not form significant amounts of
lumps in the digestive tract. Unfortunately, however, such
suspensions are very thick and semi-gelatinous. As such,
they are visually unappealing. More significantly, due to
their slimy mouth feel and extreme sweetness, such
suspensions are

composition comprising (a) a water-soluble cellulose ether

having efficacy as a bulk laxative, (b) a sweetening
component consisting of aspartame and (c) a dispersing

agent consisting of maltodextrin, wherein the relative
