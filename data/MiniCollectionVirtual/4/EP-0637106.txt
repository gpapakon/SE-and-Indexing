<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a discharge excitation 
type short pulse laser device 
according to the preamble of claim 1 (M.Blanchard et al. in Journal of Applied Physics, Vol.45, No.3, 03.03.1974).. For obtaining the laser oscillation, it is the 
requisite condition that a spatially uniform discharge be 
carried out in a laser medium. However, in those short pulse lasers such as excimer 
laser, TEA CO2 laser, and so forth, the discharge tends 
to form a converged arc, because its operating pressure 
is as high as several atmospheres. In order to prevent 
this, it has been a usual practice to effect 
pre-ionization, in which seeds of electrons are uniformly 
scattered beforehand in the main discharge region prior 
to such main discharge. In the following, explanations will be given as to 
the conventional techniques in reference to Figures 1 to 
4 of the accompanying drawing. Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view showing a 
ultra-violet (UV) pre-ionization type excimer laser  
 
device as disclosed in, for example, "ELECTRONICS", 
August issue, page 881 (1983), by Sato et al. In the 
drawing, a reference numeral 1 designates a high tension 
power source, a numeral 2 refers to a capacitor, a 
numeral 3 refers to a high resistor, 4 denotes a winding, 
5 represents a capacitor, 6a and 6b refer to 
pre-ionization pins, 7 a gap, 8 a cathode, 9 an anode, 10 
a main discharge region, and 11 a switch. Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view of a TEA CO2 laser 
device as disclosed in, for example, J. Lachambre et al., 
IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics: Vol. QE-9, No. 4, 
459p (1973); M. Blanchard et al., Journal of Applied 
Physics, Vol: 45, No. 3, 3,3. 1974; and so forth, 
which is an improvement for removing various 
disadvantages in the above-described conventional excimer 
laser device, detailed explanations of which will be 
given later. It should, however, be understood that, 
since the circuit system of the laser device shown in 
Figure 2 is made identical with that of Figure 1, its 
construction differs somewhat from those laser devices 
disclosed in these technical literature. In the drawing, 
a reference numeral 12 designates a dielectric member, a 
numeral 13 refers to a capacitor, a numeral 14 refers to 
an auxiliary electrode, a numeral 15 denotes a mesh 
cathode, and 16 a pre-discharge region. Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view showing a 
construction of the electrode section in the TEA CO2  
 
laser device shown, for example, in Y, Pan et al., The 
Review of Scientific Instruments: Vol. 43, No. 4,
