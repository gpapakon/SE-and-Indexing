<ABSTRACT>
A roof latching device for latching a convertible folding roof (1) to the 
header (2) of the windscreen of a vehicle having a pull-to mechanism (3) 

located centrally of the header (2), the pull-to mechanism including a hook 
element (5) for engagement of a formation (6) on the roof (1) when the 

roof (1) is located close to the header (2) and acting to pull the roof (1) 
firmly down onto the header (2), the latching device also including a 

locking mechanism located in the header (2) on either side of the pull-to 
mechanism (3) to lock the roof (1) against the header (2) after it has been 

pulled against the header (2) by the pull-to mechanism (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination of a convertible folding roof, a header for the windscreen of a vehicle and a roof latching device for latching said convertible folding
roof to the header, said device
comprising pull-to means located in the header, which pull-to means are located centrally in the header and can
grip the roof in a position thereof close to the header and can pull the roof
against the header, the device further comprising drive means for driving the pull-to means and locking means located in the header.A device for latching a convertible folding roof is known, for example, from EP 0 492 006, and is used in
particular in a vehicle with a convertible folding roof made of fabric. If the
rear edge of the roof is immovably connected to the vehicle, when the
roof is being closed, irrespective of whether this is carried out manually or
by mechanical means, the front edge of the roof will remain a few
centimetres away from the header. In order to move the roof against the
header the fabric of the roof must be placed under tension. For this
purpose, the device known from EP 0 492 006 comprises two pull-to
mechanisms, each placed at one side of the vehicle in the header of the
windscreen. Each pull-to mechanism comprises a movable hook element
which can engage with a matching eye-shaped element disposed on the
movable roof and can then pull the roof downwards until the roof rests
against the header. The pull-to mechanisms of the known device are
designed in such a way that the roof is locked by the pull-to mechanisms
themselves in the position pulled against the header. The locking of the
roof in this position is essential, since accidental opening of the roof must
be avoided in all circumstances.The known device has the disadvantage that the header has to have
undesirably large dimensions for the accommodation of a pull-to
mechanism at each end. On the one hand, this is due to the fact that the
way in which the pull-to means work requires such pull-to means to have
large dimensions. On the other hand, it is important that in the position in
which the roof is at a short distance from the header the position of the 
roof relative to the header can vary within a tolerance range, in particular
in the lengthwise direction of the vehicle. This tolerance range is determined
by the design of the roof, in particular by the movement mechanism
of the roof. The parts of the roof to be gripped by the pull-to means
thus must have dimensions which take the tolerance range into account.

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a convertible folding roof (1; 31), a header (2; 30) for the windscreen of a vehicle and a roof latching device for latching said convertible folding roof
to the header, said device comprising pull-to means (3; 32)

located in the header, which pull-to means are located centrally in the header and can grip the roof in a position
thereof close to the header and can pull it against the header, the device further comprising drive

means (7; 39) for driving the pull-to means and locking means (11, 12 ; 33) located in the header, characterised in that
the locking means (11, 12; 33) is located in the

header on both sides of the pull-to means,
and engages corresponding formations (13; 36) on the roof (1; 31) in order to

lock the roof (1; 31), adjacent the outer extremities thereof, against the
header (2;30), the pull-to means (3;

32) and locking means (11, 12; 33) being driven by common
drive means (7; 39) in such a way that the locking means engages said

formations on the roof after the roof (1; 31) has been pulled against the
header (2) by means of the pull-to means (3; 32).
A combination according to claim 1, characterised in that the
device comprises positioning means (25) located centrally in the header

(2, 30), for positioning the roof (1) relative to the header (2) during the
pulling.
A combination according to claim 2, characterised in that the
positioning means (25) and the locking means (11, 12) are designed in

such a way that during the pulling, the roof (1) is positioned relative to the
header by the positioning means before the roof goes into engagement

with the locking means.
A combination according to claim 3, characterised in that the drive
means (7; 39) is placed centrally in the header (2; 30). 
A combination according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the drive means comprise a drive cylinder (7; 39)

operated by a pressure medium.
A combination according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the locking means comprise a locking bar (33) which

is accommodated in the header (30) and is movable between an unlocked
and a locked position, the locking bar in the locked position interacting on

either side of the pull-to means (32) with one or more coupling means
(35) disposed on the roof.
A combination according to one or more of claims 1 - 5,

characterised in that the locking means comprise two locking bars (11,
12) accommodated in the header (2) on either side of the pull-to means

(3), one of the locking bars (11) being connected directly to the drive
means (7), and the other (12) being connected to the drive means (7) with

the interposition of reversing means (20), so that the locking bars can be
moved in opposite directions to each other by the drive means between

an unlocked position and a locked position, each locking bar in the locked
position interacting with one or more coupling means (14, 16) disposed

on the vehicle roof.
A combination according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the
coupling means comprise projections (14, 16; 35) disposed on the roof,

which projections form a positive connection with the locking bar (11, 12;
33) engaging therewith when the roof is in the locked position.
A combination according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the locking means (11, 12; 33) are of flexible design,

so that the locking means are movable in a curved header (2; 30). 
A vehicle provided with a combination according to one or more of
the preceding claims.
