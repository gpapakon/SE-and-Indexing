<ABSTRACT>
Transmitter search controllers are known in which the levels of the received transmitter signals are compared with a predetermined threshold value. If the level of the received transmitter signal exceeds the threshold value, the transmitter is classified as suitable for receiving and the transmitter search is ended. The known transmitter search controllers have the disadvantage that they cannot be adapted to specific receiving conditions. The present invention avoids these disadvantages by the fact that the response threshold is fixed according to the disturbances present.

Method for automatic and field-strength-dependent
transmitter-search control of a receiver, in which the

level of the transmitter signal received in each case is
compared with a threshold value, a search being terminated

if the level exceeds the threshold value or a search being
started if the level is below the threshold value or a

second threshold value, characterized in that, after
commissioning and/or switching-on


the level variation in the background noise over the
reception frequency range is determined and stored by

means of traversing the reception frequency range, and
then
the threshold value or the threshold values are set
according to the stored level variation in the

background noise.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
signal/noise ratio of the received signal is constantly

determined and in that the threshold value or the threshold
values are adapted to the changes which occur.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that, after automatically initiating a search, a

transmitter having the same transmission content is tuned
to.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that, during a search, the receiver is

muted.
Receiver having automatic and field-strength-dependent
transmitter-search control, comprising


a receiving section (2),
a first device (3; 4) for processing the received
radio-frequency signal,
a second device (5) for determining the level of the
transmitter signal received in each case, 
a third device (6) which compares the level determined
with a threshold value, a search being terminated if

the level determined exceeds the threshold value or a
search being started if the level determined is below

the threshold value or a second threshold value,

characterized in that

after commissioning and/or switching-on, the third
device (6) tunes the receiving section (2) in such a

way that the entire reception range is traversed,
the third device (6) evaluates the level determined by
the second device (5) for setting the variation (G) in

the background noise and stores the variation (G) in
the background noise, and
the third device (6) sets the threshold value or
threshold values according to the stored variation (G)

in the background noise.
Receiver according to Claim 5, characterized in that a
fourth device (8; 9) is present for determining the noise

level associated with the received signal and in that the
third device (6) evaluates the noise level in relation to

the level of the second device (5) and changes the
threshold values according to the evaluation.
Receiver according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the fourth device (8; 9) has a high-pass filter (8) for

separating noise and transmitter signal.
Receiver according to one of Claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that the third device (6) generates during

a search a control signal which brings about muting of the
first device (4).
Receiver according to one of Claims 5 to 8,
characterized in that a fifth device is present for

evaluating transmitter identifier signals, in that received
transmitter identifier signals are temporarily stored and 

in that, if a search is initiated by the third device (6),
any transmitter found is tuned to only if its transmitter

identifier signals correspond to those temporarily stored.
Receiver according to one of Claims 5 to 9,
characterized in that the third device (6) is formed by a

microcomputer.
