<ABSTRACT>
A switching device (10) has a thermal (39) and an electromagnetic (34) trip device, a latch (37) and one fixed and one moving contact piece (30, 31). When the switch is switched off, an electric arc is induced between the two contact pieces (30, 31) which is driven into an electric-arc quenching lamination stack (24) and is quenched therein. The switching device (10) has a blowout loop (45) which is electrically connected in parallel to the thermal and the electromagnetic tripping devices (39, 34) and is formed by resistor wire; the blowout loop is laterally next to the quenching chamber, and thus next to the prechamber (41) and a part of the electric-arc quenching lamination stack (24).
