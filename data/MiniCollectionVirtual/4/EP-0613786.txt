<ABSTRACT>
Starting with the classic incorporation to the 
security paper of security threads or strips (1) carrying 

a drawing (2) or any mark that can be readily detected 
with the naked eye, obtained upon a metallised background 

(3), the process comprises rendering the said metallised 
background (3) discontinuous, to define a sort of screen 

or the like, that reduces the intensity of the background 
and renders the latter more difficult to reproduce by 

optical means and at the same time allowing the said 
drawing (2) to be printed using cheaper and more 

accessible techniques. 
Furthermore, the discontinuous character of the 
metallised background (3) allows fluorescences to be used 

on either the screen dots (3) upon non-fluorescent 
background material or upon fluorescent background 

material having a colour that differs from that of the 
screen fluorescence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a security paper
containing a security strip or thread applicable in particular
to paper money, which paper is aimed at achieving
a greater security, i.e. making reproduction more difficult,
and at the same time achieving greater savings in the
process for obtaining the same.As is well known, in manufacturing paper money and
other kinds of security paper, the use of security threads
or strips made of a transparent film having a layer of
reflective metal, such as vacuum deposited aluminium
on a sheet of polyester, is absolutely widespread, the
said strips or threads being embedded in the security
paper as such, the latter then undergoing the inevitable
printing stage.This yields a security document, for instance a banknote,
in which the security threads are barely visible
under reflected light and yet stand out immediately and
substantially when the document is observed under
transmitted light, because of the darkness of the security
thread.Though this is a very effective solution, it is possible
to enhance the level of security of the paper by providing
the security strip or thread with a drawing that the public
may readily recognise, whilst retaining the aforesaid optical
variation effect. This is feasible by various means, for
instance by vacuum depositing aluminium through a
mask, selectively eliminating aluminium from a strip
comprising a mixture of a plastic base and aluminium
using an excimer laser, and so forth.The characters printed on the thread or band ore
however sometimes too small to be recognised by
merely observing the document, and if their size is
increased the printed characters shall stand out overmuch
when viewed under a reflected light, whence they
will be easily copied by a counterfeiter.In an attempt at overcoming this problem European
patent 0 319 157 A is known to allow the use of a drawing
having characters that are sufficiently large to be visible
with the naked eye, obtained using a partially metallised
strip, thereby essentially maintaining the strong optical
variation impact of a continuous metallised strip.This effect is in particular achieved using & waterproof
and flexible substrate, with a layer of metal on either
side thereof, with a continuous metallic sector lengthwise
on one of its sides having non-metallic areas that take
up between 10 and 50% of the surface and obtained
using a stencil, design or reiterative drawing, at least part
of the transverse non-metallic areas being wholly surrounded
with metal.The security paper subject of

<CLAIMS>
A security paper containing a strip or thread (1), applicable in particular to paper
money, said security strip or thread being included within the paper and said strip

or thread carrying letters or drawings (2) on a coated base running along the strip or
thread such that a viewer may easily recognise said letters or drawings,
characterised in that
said coated base being discontinuous and consisting of metallic or dark coloured
printed dots defining a screen which delimits the outline of the letters or drawings and

which renders said discontinuous coated base less strong;
and 
in that
 said security strip or thread optionally includes fluorescent elements.
A security paper containing a security strip or thread applicable, in particular to
paper money, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the fluorescent elements
are located on the screen dots upon a non fluorescent base material.
A security paper containing a security strip or thread, in particular to paper
money, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the fluorescent elements are located
on the screen dots upon fluorescent base material, both fluorescences

being distinguishable by being of different colours.
