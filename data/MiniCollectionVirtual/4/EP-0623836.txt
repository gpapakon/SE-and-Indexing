<ABSTRACT>
The spring-loaded hinge for spectacles is composed of, on the one hand, a front knuckle (10) firmly fixed in the lateral tenon (6) of the front piece and, on the other hand, of a side knuckle (20) connected via an elastic return mechanism (12, 30, 40, 44) to the end of the side (8). The outer edge of the end (9) of the side (8) comes to bear against a stationary heel (7) which prolongs the tenon (6). This heel (7) extends beyond the axis (15) of the hinge by a distance (d) greater than 0.3 millimetres. In addition, the side knuckle (20) has, in its face turned towards the side, a shoulder (32) which comes to bear, after rotation through a maximum desired angle ( theta ), against the inside corner (5) of the heel (7) acting as a stopper.

<CLAIMS>
An elastic hinge for a spectacle frame, connecting 
a side arm (8) to a front part, made of a front-hinge 

element (10) securely fixed to a side lug (6) of the front 
part and of a side-hinge element (20) connected by elastic 

biasing means (12, 30, 40, 44) to the end of the side arm 
(8), and a fixed heel (7) extending from a lug (6) or 

integral with the front-hinge element, the side arm (8) 
having an end (9) with an outer edge bearing against said 

heel (7), characterized in that the heel (7) extends in 
the direction of the side arm (8) beyond the axis (15) of 

the hinge by a distance (d) greater than 0.3 millimeters, 
and in that the side-hinge element (20) has, in its face 

directed towards the side arm, a recessed edge (32) which, 
after rotation through a desired maximum angle (), comes 

to bear against an abutment-forming inside angled-edge (5) 
of the heel (7) situated beside the axis (15). 
The elastic hinge according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the recessed edge (32) is planar and 

forms, with the joining plane of the heel (7) and the end 
(9) of the side arm (8) when the latter is in the open 

position, an angle equal to the desired maximum angle of 
rotation ().
