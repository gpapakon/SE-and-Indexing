<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flush-mounted box having a fastening element for fixing on base regions of cable conduits. In this case, U-shaped catch holders having catch limbs are arranged running along the base of the cable conduit, which limbs project out from the catch holder in opposite directions. The catch limbs engage rearwards, supporting the catch elements arranged on the flush-mounted box. In this case there are, on the one hand, two one-piece catch elements (3, 4) having catch hooks (31, 41) formed on the underbase (11) of the flush-mounted box (1). These catch elements (3, 4) project parallel to the mid-axis (M) of the flush-mounted box (1), offset outwards near the edge of the underbase (11). On the other hand, the opposite catch element (5, 7 with 8) is made as a movable catch closure element with corresponding opposite axially parallel offset in the mid-region between the two catch elements (3, 4).

<CLAIMS>
Socket outlet box (1) with fixing elements to attach to base area (6) of cable trunking, 
whereby U-shaped snap-on holders (2), running down the length of the cable trunking, 

with snap-in legs (21, 22) pointing outwards in the opposite direction, positioned on the 
base of the cable trunking, snap in and attach on to snap-in elements (3, 4, 8) positioned 

on the socket outlet box (1), whereby, on one side, two single-piece, moulded, snap-in 
elements (3, 4) on the underside (11) of the socket outlet box (1) have catches (31, 41), 

which protrude outwards parallel to the central axis (M) of the socket outlet box close to 
the edge of the underside (11), and whereby on the other side, the opposite snap-in 

elements (8) is designed as a moveable snap-in lock, in the relevant, opposite position 
parallel to the axis, half-way between the two snap-in elements (3, 4), characterised in 

that the movable snap-in lock is made up, in two parts, of an eccentric bolt (7) and a 
spline (8) with a contact opening (81) for the eccentric pin (71). 
Socket outlet box in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the contact opening 
(81) for the eccentric pin (71) is set as a slot transversally to the shifting direction into the 

surface of the spline (8). 
Socket outlet box in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that there is an elevated 
notch (82) moulded on at least one of the side limiting walls of the contact opening (81). 
Socket outlet box in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the spline (8) has a 
chamfer (83), angled to the snap-in leg (22), over its whole surface.
