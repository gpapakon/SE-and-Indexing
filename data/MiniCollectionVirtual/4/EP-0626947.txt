<ABSTRACT>
A compound having formula (I) wherein: n = 1 or 2; the A ring may contain one double bond; R
<
1
>
 is selected from the group including: C1-C8 alkyl substituted with 1 or more R
<
4
>
, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, and C4-C10 cycloalkyl-alkyl; R
<
4
>
 may be aryl optionally substituted or may be a heterocyclic ring system. The compounds are useful in the treatment of physiological or drug induced psychosis or dyskinesia in a mammal. These novel compounds are selective sigma receptor antagonists and have a low potential for movement disorder side effects associated with typical antipsychotic agents.
