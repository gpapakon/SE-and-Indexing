<ABSTRACT>
In a continuous caster for relatively small cross-sections, novel lightweight flame cutting machines (1) run on open tracks (4) through which water flows. The separation of the drives and gas supply arrangements into parts which necessarily and advantageously accompany the flame cutting machines and parts which are arranged in a fixed location has considerable advantages in terms of the production, maintenance and operating costs of the flame cutting machines.
