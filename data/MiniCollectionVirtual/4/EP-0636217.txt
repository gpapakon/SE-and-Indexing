to each other, but opposed with a mutual offset such that two  

 
brake disc components (1a, 1b) are formed which are 

essentially the same size. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in 
that,
 in the central area of the brake disc (1) is formed a 
flanging ring (9) for flanging the brake disc (1) to a hub. 
Process according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that,
 formed 
in the flanging ring (9) is a recess (8) from the juncture 

with the respective partition zone (3
1
, 3
2
) to the inside 
edge of the flanging ring (9). 
Brake disc (1) for a disc brake which is intended 
particularly for commercial road vehicles and is formed from 

two essentially semi-annular components (1a, 1b) which are 
connected to each other by means of two fixing means (2),
characterised in that
 
the two components (1a, 1b) of the brake disc (1) are formed by 

breaking a brake disc, manufactured as a single piece, along 
two partition zones (3
1
, 3
2
). 
Brake disc (1) according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 
each fixing means (2
1
, 2
2
) exhibits at least one hole running 
perpendicular to the partition zone concerned (3
1
, 3
2
) and 
having a female thread for a screw fastener, is radially 

opposite the other fixing means (2
1
, 2
2
) and runs tangential 
to this. 
Brake disc (1) according to Claim 9 or 10, 
characterised in 
that
 the two partition zones (3
1
, 3
2
) are arranged 
diametrically opposite to each other such that two brake disc 

components (1a, 1b) are formed which are essentially the same 
size and semi-annular (Fig. 1). 
Brake disc (1) according to Claim 9 or 10, 
characterised in 
that
 the two partition zones (3
1
, 3
2
) are arranged parallel 
to each other, but opposed with a mutual offset such that two 

brake disc components (1a, 1b) are formed which are 
essentially the same size (Fig. 3, 4).  

 
Brake disc (1) according to one of Claims 9 to 12, 

characterised in that,
 in the central area of the brake disc 
(1) features a flanging ring (9) for flanging the brake disc 

(1) to a hub. 
Brake disc (1) according to Claim 13, 
characterised in that,
 
formed in the flanging ring (9) is a recess (8) from the 

juncture with the respective partition zone (3
1
