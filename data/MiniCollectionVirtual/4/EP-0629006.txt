A superconducting switch comprising a portion of cable (30) 
including a resistive central strand (2) that is non-superconducting 

having a plurality of superconducting strands (1) or of 
superconductors (5, 6) twisted thereabout, and separated from the 

central strand by electrical insulation (3), the cable as a whole 
being insulated from the external cooling medium by thermal 

insulation (4), said central strand (2) being electrically connected 
to said superconducting strands or said superconductors at each end 

(31, 32) of said portion of cable (30), a portion of the length of 
said resistive central strand extending outside said cable at a point 

along the length of said portion of said cable and being coupled to a 
control device (12) situated outside said cooling medium, said 

control device consisting in means for injecting an electrical 
current into the circuit formed by the resistive central strand (2) 

that is connected at its ends to the superconducting strands (2) or 
to the superconductors (5, 6). 
A superconducting switch according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said portion of the length of said resistive central strand (2) 

outside said cable is cut, thereby forming two ends (14, 15) which 
are connected to said control device (12) that comprises a capacitor 

(16) in series with a discharge switch (17), a voltage source (18) 
being connected across the terminals of said capacitor (16) via a 

charging resistor (19) and a charging switch (20). 
A superconducting switch according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said charging switch (20) and said discharge switch (17) are 

controlled electronic switches. 
A superconducting switch according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said portion of the length of said extracted resistive central 

strand is cut, thereby forming two ends (14, 15) which are connected 
to said control device (12) which, by controlling (21) the primary 

winding of the transformer (22), generates a voltage pulse across the 
terminals of the secondary winding of said transformer which are 

connected to said ends (14, 15).  
 
A charger for a superconducting coil (22), the charger comprising, 
an AC voltage source (24) in a medium at ambient temperature and 

connected to a full-wave rectifier circuit feeding the 
superconducting coil (23), the rectifier and the coil (23) being 

situated in a refrigerating medium, the rectifier circuit comprising 
a transformer having a primary winding (25) and a secondary winding 

in two portions (26, 26A), each portion being connected in parallel 
with the coil (23) and feeding it alternately via control means that 

operate every other half-cycle to cause the connection between the 
corresponding portion of said secondary winding and the coil to 

switch from the superconducting state to the normal state, the 
charger being characterized in that each of said control means 

comprises a superconducting switch (1, 2, 1A, 2A) according to any 
one of claims 1, 2, 3, or 4.
