<ABSTRACT>
A mixture of a glycoside derivative together with an isethionate in the presence of water gives a composition which is effective as a pearlescent agent. The mixture may be concentrated and contain as little as 35 % by weight of water. The relative proportions by weight of glycoside to isethionate to achieve a pearlescent effect are from 0.4:1 up to 1.5:1, preferably about 0.6:1 by weight. The glycoside is preferably an alkyl polyglucoside. The isethionate may be sodium cocoyl isethionate. The mixture may additionally contain anionic detergents such as sodium sulphosuccinate, sodium alkyl sulphate or sodium alkyl ether sulphate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PEARLESCENT SURFACTANT COMPOSITIONThe present invention is directed to a surfactant composition and in particular to such a composition which shows a pearlescent effect.Surfactant compositions having a pearlescent effect have become more common in recent years, for example in hair shampoo. By pearlescent is meant that the materials reflect light in a similar manner to pearls.It is known to render a composition pearlescent by the addition of a pearlescent agent. Such a material typically is a hydrophobic material which has little, if any, detergent effect. Materials which may be used to provide a pearlescent effect include esters such as glycerol monostearate and diethyleneglycol monostearate. Many pearlescent agents have little, if any, detergent effect and, in view of their water insolubility, are typically used in solution in the detergent. The pearlescent agent can be difficult to formulate and the solution in the detergent may breakdown thereby losing the pearlescent effect. Furthermore the presence of a pearlescent agent may cause a reduction in the foaming achieved by the detergent. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a mixture having a pearlescent effect which is not liable to the problems which can be associated with the use of known pearlescent agents.According to the present invention there is provided a surfactant composition which comprises(A) a glycoside;(B) an isethionate surfactant; and(C) water; the proportions of (A) , (B) and (C) being such as to render the composition pearlescent.Preferably the composition contains sufficient water for the composition to be a flowable mixture. As discussed in more detail hereafter, the amount of water is dependent on the composition of the mixture and the 

nature of components (A) and (B) . To achieve a flowable mixture, the amount of water present is not less than 35%, and typically is at least 40% by weight of the composition of (A) , (B) and (C) .Component (A) of the composition is a glycoside and may be a monoglycoside, a polyglycoside or a mixture thereof. The glycoside is typically a compound which can be represented by the general formula (I) :R(0G) (I) a whereR is a hydrophobic moiety;G is a saccharide group; and a has a value of at least one.The group R can be hydrocarbyl group, a substituted hydrocarbyl group, a hydrocarbonoxy group or a substituted hydrocarbonoxy group. More specifically, the group R can be an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy or aryloxy group and is preferably an alkyl or alkoxy group. The
