<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to techniques for 
fabricating microstructures. More particularly, the 
invention pertains to a technique for fabricating 
sensors, and particularly accelerometers, in which a 
microstructure and resolving circuitry are embodied 
on the same chip. The construction of microsensors on microchips 
is of great interest in many industries because of 
its potential to reduce size and cost of devices 
which require the sensing of environmental or other 
conditions. An accelerometer is just one example of 
a type of sensor which has wide application 
possibilities. Acceleration sensors are known for measuring 
force or mass or to operate control systems 
responsive to acceleration. For instance, 
acceleration sensors may be used in automotive 
vehicles to deploy air bags responsive to a 
particular threshold deceleration rate of a 
vehicle. Acceleration sensors may also be used in 
the automotive industry as part of active suspension 
systems in which microcontrollers adjust suspension 
components responsive to the vertical acceleration 
of the wheels. An accelerometer comprises an acceleration-sensing 
element, or transducer, which is commonly 
interfaced to resolving circuitry for producing a  
 
useful output signal from the output of the 
transducer. Though the term "accelerometer" is 
sometimes used to refer to the sensor (or 
transducer) itself, the term is used herein to 
denote a complete system including a transducer as 
well as the resolving circuitry. Many commercially available accelerometers 
employ transducers comprising a mechanical or 
electromechanical element (e.g., piezoelectric, 
piezoresistive or strain gauge). Acceleration sensing microstructures embodied on 
silicon chips have been suggested in the prior art. 
For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,711,128 issued to 
Boura discloses an acceleration sensor formed by 
micromachining a fine monocrystal wafer. The sensor 
comprises a flat mobile mass suspended above the 
rest of the structure by means of two thin parallel 
strips situated on each side of the mass. The mass 
comprises at least one mobile capacitive plate which 
is disposed between two other capacitive plates 
which are not part of the suspended microstructure 
but are fixed on the structure. The mobile plates 
are charged to a voltage relative to the stationary 
plates. When the sensor is subjected to an 
acceleration, the mobile plates move relative to the 
fixed plates causing a change in capacitance between 
the mobile plates and each of the fixed plates.
