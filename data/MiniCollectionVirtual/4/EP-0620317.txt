<ABSTRACT>
An elastomeric rail pad (1) of generally rectangular plan 
configuration the pad having an upper face (6) adapted to 

underlie the lower face of a rail, and a lower face (3) adapted 
to overlie a concrete rail foundation member characterised 

in that the pad incorporates between the upper and lower 
face a fabric reinforcement layer (4) extending throughout at 

least the majority of the rail pad when viewed in plan, the 
fabric layer having a warp (18) and a weft (17) generally transverse 

one to the other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rail pads. Such pads are 
interposed between the lower surface of a railway rail and 
a foundation member on which the rail stands and to which 
it is usually secured. The rail foundation member may be 
a concrete or steel sleeper extending across the railway 
track, or a slab or plate, for example, running along the 
length of the rail. The purpose of the rail pad is to 
protect the foundation member from impulsive and other 
loads from passing-rail traffic, to compensate for any 
uneveness in the foundation member, and, where the rail is 
electrical, to provide some electrical insulation between 
the rail and the foundation member. Such rail pads are, 
from the very nature of their working disposition, subject 
to considerable potentially damaging forces as railway 
traffic passes along the rails supported by the pads, and 
a recurrent common problem with such pads is the damage so 
caused, and the inevitable need for frequent replacement at 
substantial cost.  It is an object of the present invention to overcome 
or at least substantially reduce the above-mentioned 
problem, and additionally to provide a rail pad capable of 
providing good impact protection for the foundation member 
therebelow. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided an elastomeric rail pad of generally rectangular 
plan configuration, the pad having an upper face adapted to 
underlie the lower face of a rail, and a lower face adapted 
to overlie a concrete rail foundation member characterised 
in that the pad incorporates between the upper and lower 
face a fabric reinforcement layer extending throughout at 
least the majority of the rail pad when viewed in plan, the 
fabric layer having a warp and weft generally transverse 
one to the other. The fabric is preferably a woven fabric. The warp and weft of the fabric may lie generally 
parallel with respect to the sides of the generally 
rectangular plan configuration rail pad. The fabric may be of any appropriate and convenient 
material, and thus may for example be of a manmade fibre 
such as nylon. More than one layer of fabric may advantageously be 
incorporated in the body of the pad to increase the effect 
of the invention. Surprisingly we have found two layers to 
be much more effective than would be expected by simply 
doubling a single layer. We have found that by means of the invention the layer  
 
of fabric reinforcement is most effective in increasing the 
resistance of the rail pad to displacement and/or 
distortion by forces

<CLAIMS>
An elastomeric rail pad of generally rectangular plan 
configuration, the pad having an upper face adapted to 

underlie the lower face of a rail, and a lower face 
adapted to overlie a concrete rail foundation member 

characterised in that the pad incorporates between the 
upper and lower face a fabric reinforcement layer 

extending throughout at least the majority of the rail 
pad when viewed in plan, the fabric layer having a 

warp and a weft generally transverse one to the other. 
The Rail Pad as claimed in claim 1 characterised in 
that the fabric is a woven fabric. 
A Rail Pad as claimed in claim 1 or 2 characterised in 
that the warp and weft of the fabric lie generally 

parallel with respect to the sides of the generally 
rectangular plan configuration Rail Pad. 
A Rail Pad as claimed in any one of the proceeding 
claims characterised in that the fabric is formed from 

a man-made fibre. 
A Rail Pad as claimed in claim 4 characterised in that 
the fabric is formed of nylon. 
A Rail pad as claimed in any one of the proceeding 
claims characterised in that pad has rectangular 

recesses (in plan view) disposed generally midway 
along two opposed sides, thereby defining on each end 

of such recesses wing portions of the pad which in use 
locate the pad with respect to the anchoring assembly 

thereof between the overlying rail and the underlying 
foundation member, characterised in that the fabric 

reinforcing layer extends into the wings providing 
stiffening thereto. 
A Rail Pad as claimed in any one of the proceeding 
claims characterised in that a plurality of layers of 

fabric are incorporated, generally parallel one to 
another, within the body of the pad. 
A rail pad as claimed in claim 7 wherein two layers of 
fabric are incorporated. 
A Rail pad as claimed in any one of the proceeding 
claims characterised in that at least one face thereof 

is provided with a plurality of protrusions to improve 
the attenuation of the rail foundation member from 

forces exerted by the rail due to traffic passing 
there across.
