<ABSTRACT>
A method of killing noxious insects with the use of either a 
shaped article having a projecting part and previously coated with 

a particular active compound or a shaped article having a projecting 
portion and provided with a spout for discharging said active compound 

is applied pressure from outside onto and around the stalks and/or 
stems of fruit vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants, thereby 

making the surfaces of said stalks and/or stems forcibly absorb the 
active compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling insects, more particularly, to
a method of controlling insects infesting fruit vegetables, flowers and ornamental
plants.The nitroimino and nitromethylene compounds disclosed in EP192060 A
are compounds exhibiting ensured insecticidal activity at extremely
low dosages as compared with the known organic phosphorus- and carbamate-series
insecticides.A method is already known in the art wherein unnecessary trees are killed with the
use of chemical-immersed carriers or needle-like shaped materials inserted into their
trunks (JP49055837 A and JP60224601 A).Pesticides are used in various kinds of formulations, most of which are applied in the
forms of emulsion, wettable powder, dust formulation and granules.The conventional spraying and dusting applications pose a number of problems to be
solved, such as soil residue and crop residue of higher or lower content of pesticides,
hazardous chemical exposure and severe working conditions required during the application
on the farmers, proliferation of chemicals in living environment, excessive
application for retaining chemical effectiveness, working efficiency in application,
etc.The inventors of the present application have found a novel method capable of effectively
controlling insects with ensured control effects.Namely, a method has been provided for controlling insects infesting fruit vegetables,
flowers and ornamental plants, which comprises applying pressure from outside 
onto and around their stalks and/or stem with the concave pinching surfaces of a
pair of pliers which have been previously coated with an active compound, so as to
make the surfaces of said stalks and/or stems absorb said active compound, wherein
said active compound is represented by the following general formula

wherein
Rrepresents hydrogen, acyl, alkyl or optionally substituted heteroarylalkyl,Arepresents hydrogen, alkyl or a divalent group connected to B,Brepresents alkyl, -S-R,

or a divalent group or atom connected to
A, wherein R has the same meaning as mentioned above,Yrepresents =N- or

wherein
T1represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, andXrepresents an electron withdrawing group.The compounds represented by the general formula (I) according to the method of
killing noxious insects of the present invention are already known from the 
following publications; Japanese Patent Applications JP60218386 A , JP61178981 A,
JP 62081382 A , JP2-288859 A, JP 2-288860 A and
JP 2-235881 A as well as WO 91/04965 A and EP
