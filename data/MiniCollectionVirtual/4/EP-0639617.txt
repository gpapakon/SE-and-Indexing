<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
vinylidene chloride copolymer composition excellent in 
processability and to a monolayer film comprising the 
vinylidene chloride copolymer composition and excellent 
in barrier property, non-extractability, mechanical 
property and high-frequency sealability. This monolayer 
film can be mainly used as a packaging material and 
wrapping film which need good barrier property used for 
ham, sausage, cheese, daily dishes and various other 
foods. As a packaging material, the monolayer film is 
used mainly in two package types. In one type, the food 
is filled into a tubular film formed beforehand in 
accordance with the form of the food to be packaged and 
then both ends are tied with aluminum wire, etc. In the 
other type, flat film is converted by means of high 
frequency sealing into a tubular film which accords with 
the form of the food, and then filling of the food and 
tying of the ends with aluminum wire, etc. are carried 
out in automatic operation. Film, sheets and containers produced from a 
vinylidene chloride copolymer composition are excellent  
 
in oxygen impermeability, moisture resistance, 
transparency, chemical resistance, oil resistance, 
adhesiveness and heat shrinkage, and further is 
excellent from the viewpoint of food hygiene, so that 
they are in use for a vast variety of food packaging 
materials and wrapping films. However, since vinylidene chloride-based 
polymers are poor in heat stability, it was indispensable 
in the previous production of these films, sheets 
and containers to add several percents of a liquid 
plasticizer to the polymer in order to prevent thermal 
decomposition caused by frictional heat at the time of 
processing. The addition of a liquid plasticizer, 
however, causes deterioration of the barrier property, 
which is the most eminent feature of vinylidene 
chloride-based polymers, and at the same time inevitably 
increases the amount of plasticizer extracted by oily 
foods. Though the thermal decomposition due to 
frictional heat at the time of processing can be 
prevented even when scarcely any liquid plasticizer is 
added if the molecular weight of the polymer is 
extremely lowered, the resulting film has a very low 
mechanical strength and cannot be used in practice. Further, for obtaining a vinylidene chloride 
copolymer composition which can be processed with 
addition of no, or a very small amount of, liquid 
plasticizer, there are known a process which comprises 
blending a vinylidene chloride-based polymer
