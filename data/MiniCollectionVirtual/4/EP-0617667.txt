<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laminar polyolefin film 
having a base layer and at least one heat sealable layer 
present on one or both surfaces of the base layer. More 
specifically, the film has a base layer comprising a blend 
of an olefin polymer and a very low density ethylene/alpha 
monoolefin copolymer and a heat sealable layer comprising 
a very low density copolymer of ethylene and a different 
alpha monoolefin. Films based on polyolefin polymers and copolymers are 
widely used in packaging applications which require 
sealing of the film to itself as the package is formed 
and/or filled. This sealing may be accomplished using 
adhesives such as low density polyethylene or 
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers. When heat sealing is 
used, it is important that the thermoplastic film be 
readily heat sealable while also maintaining other 
physical and mechanical properties such as resistance to 
tearing, tensile strength and processability in high speed 
packaging equipment. In form/fill packaging operations, film is generally 
first processed into a bag, a bottom being formed by 
squeezing together two films, and subjecting the bottom to 
a temperature above the seal initiation temperature under 
pressure to seal the bottom of the bag. The bag is 
subsequently filled with the goods to be packaged, and the 
top is then sealed in a similar fashion. Film heat sealing is generally effected by means of 
heated flat surfaces, between which film surfaces are  
 
forcefully pressed together at a temperature above the 
seal initiation temperature of the film. When use is made 
of equipment such as vertical form, fill and seal 
machines, the bag is filled with the contents to be 
packaged while the bottom seal is still hot. Cooling the 
seal would entail too long a waiting time, thus 
lengthening the cycle time and increasing operating costs. 
Consequently, the film must be one which enables the 
formation of a strong seal even as the seal formed is at 
or near the seal formation temperature, i.e., it must have 
good hot tack seal strength. There are several other desirable characteristics of 
a heat sealable film which enable trouble free performance 
in form fill and seal applications. First the film should 
provide strong seals at a low temperature to minimize 
energy requirements. Additionally, the film should allow 
for strong seals over a broad temperature range so that 
the film is more forgiving of heat sealing equipment 
adjustments and inadequacies. Further, the film should 
enable the development of
