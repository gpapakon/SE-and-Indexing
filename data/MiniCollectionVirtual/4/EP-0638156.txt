<ABSTRACT>
Device for flexible hoses of the kind, which internally and/or externally are reinforced by means of a coil spring (11, 19) or the like for preventing the hose (10) from collapsing at flexure. The spring (11, 19) is attached to an internal socket-shaped nipple (12) and/or an external socket (17) only at one end. The socket is arranged to be connected to one end portion of the hose through forced fitting. The spring (11, 19) is provided freely movable in and/or on the hose. The spring (11) is screwed firmly on the nipple and compressed before insertion in the hose (10), and it is inserted in the hose in compressed condition, after which the spring is decompressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a device for flexible hoses 
of the. kind, which internally and/or externally are reinforced 
by means of a coil shaped spring or the like for 
preventing the hose from collapse when bending. Problems arise when plastic hoses are exposed to heat, in 
particular shower hoses. When hot water passes through the 
hose, it expands (approximately: 20%) and loses its stability, 
which causes the hose to fold at bending, ie. it 
collapses so that the water is choked or completely blocked. Through US-3889717 and SE-57563 is known to provide a flexible 
hose with a coil, so that the hose does not collapse, if 
for instance, vacuum is built up in the system or the hose 
is exposed to twists and bends. The coil spring can even be 
introduced externally on the hose. According to these 
patents the coil spring is loosely provided, and if the hose 
is warmed up it expands, which results the coil spring to 
lose its hold and be displaced and not achieve the protection, 
which the spring is intended for at the exposed 
locations. In most cases abrupt flexures occur only at one end portion 
of the hose, where the hose is attached, for instance to a 
water tap, and therefor the hose only needs to be reinforced 
at this position. US-A-3 610 289 discloses an air line for use with articulated vehicles, 
the air line comprising a hose reinforced by a coil spring, the latter being held at the ends of the hose by an internal socket shaped nipple. The reinforced flexible hose is defined by the features of claim 1 and 
the method of its manufacture by the steps of claim 6. The object of this invention is by simple means and with 
ease be able to mount the device, which protects flexible 
hoses from collapsing when these are flexured. These tasks 
have been solved by means of a spring, which is attached to  
 
an inner socket-shaped nipple only at 
one end, which are arranged through force fitting to be 
connected to one end-portion of the hose, and that the 
spring is provided freely movable in the hose and 
that the spring before insertion in the hose, is screwed 
firmly on the nipple, compressed, and inserted in the hose 
in a compressed condition, after which the spring is decompressed. The invention will be described in closer detail with reference 
to accompanying drawings, which show some embodiments 
of the invention.

<CLAIMS>
Reinforcing flexible hose for conducting fluids having 
varying temperature which effects the structure of the hose, which is 

reinforced by means of a coil spring (11) for preventing the hose (10) 
from collapsing at flexure, whereby
 
said spring (11) at one end is screwed to an internal socket-shaped 

nipple (12), which holds said screwed end of said spring (11) 
intermediate to said nipple and the hose (10) and the second end of 

said spring (11, 19) is axially movable, said nipple (12) being 
arranged to be connected to one end portion of the hose through force 

fitting.  
 
Reinforced flexible hose according to claim 1,
characterized in,
 
that the nipple (12) at its one end, situated off the spring-hold 

is provided with a radially arranged end plate (14) intended to 
be placed outside the said end portion of the hose. 
Reinforced flexible hose according to claim 1,
characterized in,
 
that to the hose attachable part (15) of the nipple (12) is 

arranged with barbs (16).  
 
Reinforced flexible hose according to claim 1,
characterized in,
 
that on the outside of the end portion of the hose, where it is 

provided with the nipple, a hose antiexpansion casing socket (17) 
is arranged. 
Reinforced flexible hose according to claim 1,
characterized in,
 
that a spring-hold (18) of the casing socket (17) is shaped 

with a threaded portion, the thread pitch of which corresponds to 
the pitch of the coil-shaped spring mounted on the casing socket. 
Method of manufacturing a reinforced flexible hose according to claim 1,
characterized in,
 
that the spring (11) before insertion in the hose (10) is screwed 

firmly on the nipple, compressed and inserted in the hose in 
compressed condition, after which the compression is revoked.
