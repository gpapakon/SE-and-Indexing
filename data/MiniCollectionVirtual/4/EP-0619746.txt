<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is used in portable regulating aerosol 
appliances for pharmaceutical applications. The appliances are intended for vaporizing and spraying 
of an active element in the respiratory system of the user. Generally, the appliances consist of a body equipped with 
a mouth or nose piece, a regulating bottle containing the product 
to be sprayed, an injection duct connected to the regulating bottle 
and opening up into the mouth or nose piece. To use the appliances, the user must simultaneously press 
the regulating bottle, while he inhales in the mouth or nose piece, 
in order to drive the sprayed dose of the product into the 
respiratory tracts. Unfortunately, the efficiency of the device greatly 
depends on the ability of user to correctly synchronize both 
maneuvers. Extensive research has resulted in automatic and semi-automatic 
appliances whereby the active element is injected by the 
patient when he inhales in the appliance. Such appliances are 
frequently based on complex and rather expensive methods which are 
sometimes quite unreliable. Document FR-A-1 463 014 discloses an aerosol inhalation 
device for synchronizing inhalation by a user with spraying 
of a dose of an active element comprising a regulating bottle 
that features a closing device and that acts in combination 
with valve like elements. Document US-A-3 429 310 discloses an aerosol inhalating 
device too, comprising an aerosol container packaged in a two 
part enclosure. None of the devices disclosed in the above documents 
provides for a solution that could solve the above-mentioned 
drawbacks of complexity, expense and unreliability.  
 The device in this invention cures these disadvantages 
and offers a simple, economical and reliable solution to the 
synchronization problem. In the device in this invention, the user is prevented 
from or very restricted in inhaling, until the manoeuver for 
releasing the dose of active element has been executed. Therefore, 
the user has more time available to activate the regulating bottle, 
as soon as he has started his attempt to inhale through the 
appliance, without reducing the synchronization action. Therefore, the device, which is built with the same 
general design of conventional appliances, that is: regulating  
 
regulating bottle, mouth piece, has, in addition thereto, a 
closing device, acting as a valve, which opens with the 
motion that activates the release of a dose of the product 
from the regulating piece. This valve, which remains closed when the 
appliance is in

<CLAIMS>
An aerosol inhalation device for synchronizing inhalation 
by the user with spraying of a dose of an active element, 

said device consisting of a body (1) equipped with a 
mouth or nose piece (2), and a regulating bottle (3), 

said active element being released from said regulating 
bottle (3) when the user presses said bottle (3) onto the 

body (1), which maneuver shall slide said bottle into 
said body,
 
said regulating bottle (3) featuring a closing device 

acting as a valve (6, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17) which prevents 
or restricts inhaling until the user executes said 

maneuver which releases a dose of the active element 

allowing simultaneously for inhalation and the free flow 
of the active element,
 
characterized in that
 
the regulating bottle (3) is placed in a runner (15) 

which slides in a waterproof manner around the body (1), 
and in that said valve consists of one or more slots 

placed on said body and of one or more slots placed on 
the runner (11) which are brought into alignment only 

when said bottle (3) is activated by the runner (15).  
 
The aerosol inhalation device of Claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 with regulating bottles (3) not initially 
provided with the device, spacers are provided to 

compensate for the functional dimensional differences 
with the originally provided body.  

 
An aerosol inhalator device according to the preceding claims characterized by the runner 
(15) as a sealing means for the device, protecting the device against contamination.
