<DESCRIPTION>
 "Anti-radar nets."The present invention relates to anti-radar nets.Anti-radar nets are known since many years. In general those nets consist of several layers of materials which partially absorb and partially reflect radar signals, at least one layer of which is a heterogeneous electricity conducting film which reflects part of the arriving radar waves. The reflected image should correspond to the surroundings where the concerned anti-radar nets are located.For that purpose, among other approaches there have been incorporated metal fibres into the nets, sometimes also a creased metal foil.All these materials require quite complex manufacturing processes which are rather expensive, among which the gluing of metal foil on textiles, without achieving however a satisfying attenuation of the frequencies above 30 GHz .The purpose of the present invention is to provide anti- radar nets with a high attenuation, above 10 dB, at high frequency waves ( from 8 to 94 GHz ) , measured according to the known method of a monostatic setting, in which a radar wave from a source is emitted through a chamber or tunnel which is completely covered with absorbing material, except one plate at the extremety of said tunnel, situated in the so called window, by which the radar wave is reflected to the source of which the antenna is now used as receiver. 

In order to test a radar net a piece of the material is provided between de source/receiver and the reference plate, and the reflected signal is compared with the reflected signal without the radar net. The ratio of these two signals is called attenuation and is expressed in dB.The anti-radar nets according to the invention consist of a fabric and a coating layer on both sides, characterised in that the weft threads of the fabric are provided with metal fibers and at least one of the coating layers is provided with carbon fibers.The invention also relates to a manufacturing method for anti-radar nets.The first anti-radar panels were obtained from expanded metal grids. After that one has adopted various foils with dispersed metal fibers mixed therein, and/or with a punched metal foil between a support fabric and an external coating layer of synthetic material.The manufacturing method of the anti-radar nets of the invention is characterised in that the support fabric comprises weft threads with metal fibres whereas the coating layers, eg. made of synthetic material, are provided with carbon fibres which are distributed and mixed through the coating layer matrix by a foaming
