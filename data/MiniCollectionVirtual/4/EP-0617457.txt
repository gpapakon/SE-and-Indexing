<ABSTRACT>
A wafer which allows manufacture of a device to 
proceed at an exalted yield by preventing the resolution 

of exposure at the step of photolithography during the 
manufacture of the device from being impaired is 

obtained by a method which comprises a slicing step for 
slicing a single crystal ingot thereby obtaining wafers 

of the shape of a thin disc, a chamfering step for 
chamfering the wafer obtained by the slicing step, a 

lapping step for imparting a flat surface to the 
chamfered wafer, an etching step for removing 

mechanical strain remaining in the lapped wafer, an 
obverse surface-polishing step for polishing one side 

of the etched wafer, and a cleaning step for cleaning 
the polished wafer, which method is characterized by 

interposing between the etching step and the obverse 
surface-polishing step a reverse surface-preparing step 

for preparing the shape of the reverse side of the 
wafer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the
production of a semiconductor wafer, particularly a
single crystal silicon wafer (hereinafter referred to
simply as "wafer" ).Generally, the method for the production of a wafer
comprises a slicing step for slicing a single crystal
ingot pulled up by a single crystal pulling device
thereby obtaining wafers of the shape of a thin disc, a
chamfering step for chamfering the peripheral edge part
of the wafer obtained by the slicing step thereby
preventing the wafer from cracking or chipping, a
lapping step for lapping the chamfered wafer thereby
flattening the surface thereof, an etching step for
depriving the lapped wafer of residual mechanical
strain, a surface-polishing step for polishing one
surface of the etched wafer, and a cleaning step for
cleaning the polished wafer thereby removing abrasive
and foreign matter adhering thereto.The wafer which is produced after the various
steps mentioned above, however, entails the following
objectionable effects because an etched surface remains
forever on the reverse side thereof.A mixed acid is generally used as the etchant for 
the etching step mentioned above. When the etching
treatment of a wafer is carried out by the use of this
mixed acid, a large undulation W1 having a period in
the approximate range of 0.5 to 1 mm and a P-V (peak
to valley) value in the approximate range of 0.1 to 0.5
µ m, the magnitudes peculiar to the mixed acid,
persists on the reverse side of a wafer W which has not
undergone the surface polishing mentioned above as
illustrated in Fig. 5 (a) (depicting the wafer W in a
free state).When the reverse side of the wafer W is fastened to
a chucking plate 10 at the step of photolithography in
the process of production of a device, the undulation
W1 mentioned above on the reverse side transfers
toward the obverse side and gives rise to an
undulation W1' on the obverse side as illustrated in
Fig. 5 (b). This undulation W1' degrades the resolution
of exposure and consequently causes a decline in the
yield of the device.As means to solve the problem mentioned above, the
method of polishing both the obverse and the reverse
sides of the wafer W as illustrated in Fig. 6 (a) may
be conceived. In accordance with this method, since the
undulation W1 illustrated in Fig. 5 (a) is absent from
the reverse side of the wafer W, the problem mentioned
above does not arise even when the reverse side of the
wafer W is fastened through aspiration to the chucking 
plate 10 as illustrated in Fig. 6 (b) at the step of
photo
