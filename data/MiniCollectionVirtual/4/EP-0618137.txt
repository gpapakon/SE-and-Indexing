<ABSTRACT>
A compacting device for transversely bringing together 
fragile cylindrical products, particularly cigarettes, or 

similar, and in cigarette packing machines, comprises a 
horizontal supporting surface (4) for at least one group 

(1, 1', 1'') of cigarettes (S), in which the cigarettes 
are placed side by side and substantially parallel to 

each other and with their ends aligned, and two members 
(6, 6') to press the cigarettes against each other, 

between which the group of cigarettes is interposed, and 
which are made to oscillate, in phase and in opposite 

directions to each other, transversely with respect to 
the longitudinal axis of the cigarettes (S), between a 

position of approach to each other and a position of 
withdrawal from each other. According to the invention, 

the two pressing members (6, 6') are driven in a 
constrained mode (12, 17, 17'), known as a positive mode, 

with only one degree of freedom, a single common cam (12) 
being provided to generate the approach and withdrawal of 

both the pressing members (6, 6'), by interacting with a 
pair of rollers (17, 17'), spaced apart, for each pressing 

member (6, 6').

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a compacting device for 
transversely bringing together in a compact arrangement 
fragile cylindrical products, particularly cigarettes, or 
similar, for use in cigarette packing machines for 
example, comprising a horizontal supporting surface for 
at least one group of cigarettes, the cigarettes in the 
group being fed to and placed side by side on the said 
surface in a substantially parallel arrangement and with 
their ends substantially aligned with each other, between 
two members to press the cigarettes against each other, 
extending parallel to the axis of the cigarettes and over 
at least part of the length of the cigarettes, these 
pressing members being made to oscillate, in phase and in 
opposite directions to each other, transversely with 
respect to the longitudinal axis of the cigarettes lying 
side by side, and alternately between an extreme position 
of maximum approach to each other and a position of 
maximum withdrawal, each interacting with the outer side 
of the adjacent outer cigarette of the said group of 
cigarettes. Compacting devices of this type are known and are 
used in cigarette packing machines. In these machines, 
stations are provided for the transfer of groups of 
cigarettes from a feed hopper to a conveyor cradle by 
which ordered groups of cigarettes lying on top of each 
other, perfectly aligned and brought together, are fed to 
the subsequent packing stations. At the transfer 
stations, the cigarettes are fed to a supporting surface 
which is substantially coplanar with a plurality of 
conveyor cradles which are made to advance by steps in 
front of the said supporting surface. The transfer from 
the supporting surface to the conveyor cradle takes place 
in the axial direction of the cigarettes, after these  
 
have been brought together in a compact arrangement and 
transversely with respect to their longitudinal extension 
by the action of the pressing members. The cigarettes are 
brought together to such an extent that the total transverse 
dimension of the group of cigarettes is slightly 
less than the size of the insertion aperture of the 
conveyor cradles. The feed of the groups of cigarettes 
and the movement of the pressing members is synchronized 
with the steps of advance of the conveyor cradles, which 
in turn are synchronized with the steps of the operating 
cycles of the subsequent operating units of the machine. 
For the conversion of the rotary motion of a driving 
motor to the oscillating motion of the pressing members,

Compacting device for transversely bringing 
together fragile cylindrical products, particularly 

cigarettes, or similar, for use in cigarette packing 
machines for example, comprising a horizontal supporting 

surface (4) for at least one group (1, 1', 1'') of 
cig
arettes (S), the cigarettes in the group being fed to 
and placed side by side on the said surface (4) in a 

substantially parallel arrangement and with their ends 
substantially aligned with each other, between two 

members (6, 6') to press the cigarettes against each 
other, extending parallel to the axis of the cigarettes 

and over at least part of the length of the cigarettes, 
these pressing members (6, 6') being made to oscillate, 

in phase and in opposite directions to each other, 
transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the 

cigarettes (S) lying side by side, and alternately 
between an extreme position of maximum approach to each 

other and a position of maximum withdrawal, each interacting 
with the outer side of the adjacent outer cigarette 

of the said group (1, 1', 1'') of cigarettes (S), 
characterized in that the two opposing pressing members 

(6, 6') of the compacting device are driven in a constrained 
mode (12, 17, 17'), known as a positive mode, 

with a transmission which has only one degree of freedom. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the positive transmission consists of a driving cam 

(12) caused to rotate by a motor (M) and common to both 
pressing members (6, 6'). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cam (12) is shaped in such a way that, with 

a bidirectional rotary movement about its central axis 
between two extreme angular positions, it alternately 

causes maximum approach of the pressing members (6, 6') 
in one of the two extreme positions and maximum withdrawal 

of the pressing members (6, 6') in the other of 
the extreme positions. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
 

claims, characterized in that the pressing members (6, 
6') are supported by oscillating levers (7, 7') which are 

pivoted on diametrically opposite sides of the axis (11) 
of rotation of the common positive drive cam (12), each 

lever carrying, eccentrically with respect to the pivot 
axis (8, 8'), on the side facing the cam (12), a pair of 

rollers (17, 17') interacting with the cam and spaced 
apart from each other on opposite sides of the plane 

passing through the pivot axes (8, 8') and the axis of 
rotation (11) of the positive drive cam (12), while the 

cam (12) is made in such a way that all the rollers (17, 
17') always bear on the surface of the cam and the 

rotation of the cam causes alternating oscillation in the 
direction of lesser or greater separation of the oscillating 

levers, in other words a direction of approach or 
withdrawal of the pressing members (6, 6'). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cam (12) consists of 

three circular sectors of identical lesser radius (112) 
and three further sectors of identical greater radius 

(212), these sectors being joined together peripherally 
without solution of continuity and distributed over the 

cam (12) alternately with respect to the size of the 
radius and at substantially equal intervals, so that, in 

an extreme angular position of the cam (12), the rollers 
(17, 17') of both pairs of rollers, each of which is 

associated with one of the pressing members (6, 6'), lie, 
in the case of the first of the said rollers (17, 17') of 

each pair, against sectors of lesser radius (112), and, 
in the case of the second of the said rollers (17, 17') 

of each pair, against sectors of greater radius (212), 
while in the other extreme position the first rollers 

interact with sectors of greater radius (212) and the 
second with sectors of lesser radius (112). 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the cam (12) drive is 

provided by a stepping motor (M), directly or through a 
transmission (13, 14, 15), and includes a brief stop at 

the points of reversal of the oscillatory motion of the 
 

cam (12), in other words at the extreme angular positions 
of the cam. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the angular amplitude of 

the oscillatory motion of the cam (12) is slightly 
greater than the angular distance between two adjacent 

circular sectors (112, 212), preferably corresponding to 
an angular amplitude between an intermediate point of one 

and an intermediate point of the other of the said 
adjacent sectors (112, 212). 
Device according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that it is used in stations for successive transfer 

into a conveyor cradle (3), in a number of stacked 
layers, of a number of groups (1, 1', 1'') of cigarettes 

(S), each consisting of a certain predetermined number of 
cigarettes (S) lying side by side in a horizontal plane 

(4) and with their ends aligned, each layer consisting of 
a group of cigarettes (1, 1', 1'') fed from a hopper (2, 

2', 2'') to a supporting surface (4) of a transfer station 
which is at a level above the supporting surface (4) of 

the transfer station for the preceding or subsequent 
group (1, 1', 1'') of cigarettes (S), a compacting device 

driven by its own motor (M) being associated with each 
station.
