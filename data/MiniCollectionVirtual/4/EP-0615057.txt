<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a device for 
distribution valve control for an internal 
combustion engine, having at least two compliant 
valves per cylinder and a camshaft with variable 
profile cams. The distribution controls using the variable 
profile cams, the so-called "splined" cams, are 
employed to optimize the efficiency, the 
consumption and the emission levels of the engine 
by varying, among other things, the lift and 
the opening times of the valves as a function of 
the revolution speed. Using this type of cam, the contact line between 
tappet and cam lies on a plane which is never 
vertical to the axis of the tappet itself, as in 
traditional cam types, but which forms an angle 
which continually changes according to the 
position of the cam to the tappet. Another problem linked to the use of "splined" 
cams is the rotatory force which is generated in 
the tappet by the cam during its rotation due to 
its particular profile, which must be countered 
to allow the tappet to work normally.  
 A further problem of the control in question 
concerns the fact that when the cam is moved 
longitudinally along its axis it creates a force 
in the tappet which tends to displace it 
sideways in the direction in which the cam is 
moving. This force, like the one before, must 
also be efficiently countered in order to obtain 
good working performance from all the 
distribution unit. EP-A-0 263 794 
shows a distribution control for an 
internal combustion engine with at least two 
compliant valves per cylinder driven by a single 
"splined" cam. The distribution control 
comprises, furthermore, a guide shoe in contact 
with the cam and a guide shoe seating provided 
with a cylindrical guide appendix, which is 
inserted into a seating in the cylinder head, in 
order to keep it in the required position thus 
countering the abovementioned forces. One of the disadvantages of this type of 
solution is the fact that all the forces are 
unloaded on the cylindrical guide. It therefore 
must be of sizeable dimensions and furthermore 
needs to be manufactured very precisely in order  
 
to avoid the danger of seizure which would have 
disastrous consequences for the engine. Furthermore its dimensions increase the overall 
weight of the rocking lever and, as a 
consequence, limit the revolution speed of the 
engine. Moreover, with said control it is necessary to 
carry out one further manufacturing operation on 
the cylinder head with the maximum precision. Said problems are also present in EP-A-0 570 963 (priort
