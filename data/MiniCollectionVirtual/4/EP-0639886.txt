<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to voltage step-up circuits, in 
particular to a voltage step-up circuit which can be 
integrated monolithically in CMOS technology and used to 
drive the drain of a field-effect transistor of a memory 
cell during the programming phase. In this kind of application, the memory cell must be 
supplied a drain voltage which be constant as far as 
possible while the current drawn by the cell varies. This technical problem becomes specially important where a 
single voltage step-up circuit is employed for programming 
a group of memory cells, and the overall current draw 
variations increase. The arrangements adopted heretofore to provide adequate 
stability for the output voltage of a voltage step-up 
circuit consist basically of providing a Zener diode, or a 
series of diodes or diode-connected transistors, between 
the output terminal of the voltage step-up circuit and a 
reference potential, usually a ground potential. However, where high output voltages are involved, say on 
the order of ten volts, the implementation of a Zener diode 
in CMOS technology becomes difficult, whereas the use of a 
diode chain -- which would have to include five or six 
diodes -- may bring about significant deviations from 
nominal values due to variations in the technological 
process parameters. The technical problem which underlies this invention is,  
 
therefore, to provide a voltage step-up circuit which can 
be integrated in CMOS technology and regulated even at high 
output voltages. Another requirement is that the voltage 
step-up circuit output should be regulated using simple 
circuit arrangements, so that the incorporation of several 
such voltage step-up circuits to memory cell devices would 
lead to no excessive expansion of the integration area. The technical problem is solved by a voltage step-up 
circuit of the type described and characterized in the 
appended claims to this specification. The features and advantages of a step-up circuit according 
to the invention will become apparent from the following 
detailed description of an embodiment thereof, given by way 
of example and not of limitation with reference to the 
accompanying drawings. Figure 1 shows a diagram, partly in block form, of a 
voltage step-up circuit with regulated output voltage 
according to the invention; and Figure 2 shows a preferred circuit diagram for a control 
block C, as shown in Figure 1, implemented in CMOS 
technology. The theoretical diagram of a voltage step-up circuit 
according to the invention,
