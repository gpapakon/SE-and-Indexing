<ABSTRACT>
Broadly, the present invention in one aspect is directed to a method for reliably 
determining lymph nodes enriched in tumor reactive cells, 
e.g.
, CD4+ tumor-specific 
lymphocytes, often called T-helper cells or T-helper lymphocytes. This method 

includes the steps of administering to a patient an effective amount of a radiolabeled 
locator which specifically binds a marker produced by or associated with neoplastic 

tissue, 
e.g.
 cancer. Time then is permitted to elapse following the administration for 
the radiolabeled locator to preferentially concentrate in any neoplastic tissue and for 

unbound radiolabeled locator to be cleared, so as to increase the ratio of photon 
emissions from neoplastic tissue to background photon emissions in the patient. After 

the time has elapsed, the patient is accessed (
e.g.
 preferably, surgically; note: use of a 
laproscope may be impractical, though use of such instruments is not precluded in the 

present invention) with a radiation detection probe for determining lymph node sites 
exhibiting accretion of the radiolabeled locator by detecting with the probe elevated 

levels of radiation at the lymph node sites. The lymph node sites exhibiting such 
elevated levels of radiation then are removed and subjected to gross visual analysis, 

though such sites alternatively/additionally may be subjected to histological analysis, 

e.g.
 hematoxylin and eosin (H
&
E) histologic evaluation. Those determined and 
removed lymph nodes that also are determined to be tumor-free by gross observation or 

free of gross metastatic disease (
i.e.,
 those lymph nodes that visually appear normal, 
but which take-up antibody) then are selected and cultured to proliferate tumor reactive 

cells, 
e.g.
, tumor-specific T lymphocytes therein. The selected lymph nodes are 
subjected to mitogenic stimulation. Advantageously, then, the lymph nodes are 

cultured in the presence of, for example, Interleukin-2 (IL-2), anti-CD₃ monoclonal 
antibody, and, optionally, neoplastic tissue which may be autologous or allogeneic 

tumor. The tumor reactive cells, 
e.g.,
 T lymphocytes, proliferated then can be used in 
accordance with adoptive immunotherapy regimens for mitigating (moderating) the 

progression of tumor. The expanded or proliferated tumor reactive cells, 
e.g
., T 
lymphocytes, are an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of cancer.

develop metastatic disease outside the colon or recturn. The majority of these patients 
will not be curable by second-look surgery, because the disease will be intrahepatic as 
well as extrahepatic. Additional therapies are needed to improve survival of 
patients with this disease. Adoptive immunotherapy provides an attractive treatment modality for cancer 
therapy. Using lymphokines such as Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated 
killer cells (LAK) derived from patient peripheral blood, Rosenberg, et al.  
 
demonstrated that a small but significant percentage of patients with melanoma and 
renal cell cancer achieve a long-lasting response. Rosenberg, et al., "Adoptive Cellular
