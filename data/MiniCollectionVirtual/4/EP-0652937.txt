<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a detergent additive for 
inclusion in a particulate, free-flowing laundry detergent 
composition, comprising: polyvinyl pyrrolidone of molecular 
weight from 1,000 to 100,000, finely divided powder 
having a particle size of less than 20 micrometres, hydrating 
salt, and binding agent. Also included is a process for making a free-flowing, 
particulate laundry detergent composition, comprising forming a 
detergent additive by mixing the PVP, finely divided powder and 
hydrating salt, and spraying on the binding agent, and then 
admixing the additive with detergent particles. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) is a desirable laundry detergent 
ingredient because it: (a) inhibits dye transfer in the wash, thus 
protecting fabric colors; (b) scavenges chlorine from the wash 
water, thus reducing fabric bleaching by chlorine-containing wash 
water; and (c) prevents soils released from the washed fabrics 
from being redeposited on the fabric during the wash. EP-A-327 927 
indead discloses a particulate detergent additive containing polyvinyl 
pyrrolidone, nonionic surfactants, quaternary compounds and silica, 
which prevents dyes or brightening agents being transferred from 
coloured to incoloured textiles during washing without the formation 
of unacceptable odours. However, it 
has been found that simply admixing PVP into a granular laundry 
detergent composition, particularly one containing citric acid, 
can cause flow problems and lumping and caking over time when the 
detergent composition is exposed to humid conditions. In the 
extreme case, the sticky PVP can cause the detergent composition 
to form into a brick-like mass inside the detergent carton. It has now been found that this negative effect from admixing 
PVP into the detergent composition is reduced or eliminated 
through use of the present PVP additive. Another advantage of this additive involves reducing the 
problems associated with handling PVP itself in bulk. Bulk  
 
quantities of the additive will tend to cake less and flow better 
than PVP by itself. It is thus more easily handled. U.S. Patent 3,868,336, Mazzola et al, issued February 25, 
1975, discloses a process for improving flowability of particulate 
detergents which include an oily detergent improver using a porous 
or finely divided flow-promoting agent. U.S. Patent 3,849,327, DiSalvo et al, issued November 19, 
1974, discloses the manufacture of a free-flowing particulate 
heavy duty synthetic detergent composition containing nonionic 
surfactant and
