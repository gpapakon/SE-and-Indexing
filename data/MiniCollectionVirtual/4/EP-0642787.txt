<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention belongs to the fields of 
pharmacology and pharmaceutical chemistry, and provides a 
new method of assisting people who are dependent on the use 
of tobacco or nicotine to break the habit. It is well known that the chronic administration 
of nicotine results in tolerance and, eventually, 
dependence. The use of tobacco has become extremely 
widespread in all countries, despite the well known adverse 
effects of the use of tobacco in all its forms. Thus, it 
is clear that tobacco use is extremely habit-forming, if 
not addictive, and that its use provides sensations to the 
user which are pleasant and welcome, even though the user 
is fully aware of the drastic long term ill effects of its 
use. Rather recently, vigorous campaigns against the 
use of tobacco have taken place, and it is now common 
knowledge that the cessation of smoking brings with it 
numerous unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, which include 
irritability, anxiety, restlessness, lack of concentration, 
lightheadedness, insomnia, tremor, increased hunger and 
weight gain, and, of course, a craving for tobacco.  At the present time, probably the most widely 
used therapy to assist the cessation of tobacco use is 
nicotine replacement, by the use of nicotine chewing gum or 
nicotine-providing transdermal patches. It is widely 
known, however, that nicotine replacement is not effective 
without habit-modifying psychological treatment and 
training. A few drugs have been used to treat nicotine 
dependence, including clonidine, an α-noradrenergic 
agonist, and alprazolam, a benzodiazepine agonist. A few 
of the benzodiazepine psychotropic drugs have been 
described as of some use in tobacco cessation but are not 
in widespread use. Some serotonin affecting drugs have 
been described as anti-smoking aids, particularly including 
buspirone, which has been described by West etal. as a 
promising aid to people trying to cease the use of tobacco. 
Psychopharmacology104:91-96 (1991). Buspirone is a 5-HT1A 
(serotonin 1A receptor) partial agonist, with considerably 
higher agonist activity than antagonist activity. However, 
5-HT1A antagonists have not previously been discovered to 
be useful in the cessation of smoking or tobacco use in 
general. Such antagonists have been indicated as useful 
for many purposes in the literature, including depression, 
appetite disorders, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, various 
gastrointestinal disorders, headaches and cardiovascular 
disorders. The literature does not teach a connection 
between
