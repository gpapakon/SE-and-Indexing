<ABSTRACT>
A positive photoresist composition applicable 
for printing and making gas sensors, color filters and 

the like,without difficulties in process-control for 
making them, without any deteriorations in the good 

properties that photoresists originally have, which 
comprises a compound having at least one group selected 

from a sulfonamide, carboxylic acid amide and ureido group 
which are substituted at one position, a dissolution 

inhibitor and an organic solvent and with which a thin 
color filter having various excellent properties such as 

color darkness and color reproductivity can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a positive photoresist
composition used for producing a positive pattern by
utilizing the difference between the dissolving rates of
exposed and unexposed parts of the photoresist to an
alkaline developer which is yielded by exposing the
photoresist film to a ray such as ultraviolet, far
ultraviolet X ray or electron beam. In more
detail this invention relates to a positive photoresist
composition which can be used for producing semiconductors;
printing plates, color filters used in solid-state
color camera elements or color liquid crystal display
elements; color images containing coloring
matters such as printing inks; gas sensors which are
produced by forming membranes containing compounds such
as dyes into desired figures.Hitherto, for producing semiconductors or
printing plates, positive photoresists comprising
matrix resins such as alkaline-soluble resin or the like
and dissolution inhibitors such as quinonediazide
sulfonic acid esters have been used. Various kinds of
applications of the resist, other than for semiconductors
or printing plates, can be expected. However, in the
printing field, for example, after forming a resist
pattern, complicated processes for coloring with inks are
required. Concerning the gas sensors using thin layers 
which are obtained by spin-coating a composition prepared
by dissolving an electroconductive compound such as a
phthalocyanine derivative and a resin into a solvent, a
method for forming the thin layer into a desired figure
has not yet been known.Recently, a method for producing color
filters by using a resist composition prepared by adding
a dye into a matrix resin, a solvent, etc. has been
proposed. This method has an advantage that a thinner
layer can be obtained comparing to a method by using a
casein or a gelatin. However, in order to dye the thin
film into dark color, a large quantity of a dye has
to be added. Since dyes such as acid dyes and direct
dyes, which have been used for color filters so far,
do not have sufficient solubilities to the solvents,
the dyes insufficiently dissolved in the resist often
deteriorates the good properties the resist originally
has.EP-A-0 628 599 (prior art according to Art. 54(3) EPC)

filters, which comprises a novolak resin containing
