<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an optical fiber distribution apparatus (10) with slide-out 
trays (20) including optical connectors (32) and splice trays (30) mounted thereon. 

Each tray has a hinged protective cover (43) and a front portion (21) which drops 
down to provide access to the connectors. The splice tray is mounted on a platform 

(24) elevated from the tray so that fibers (26) coming into the tray can be stored in 
the gap formed thereby.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical fiber trays used in fiber distribution
frames.Optical fiber distribution frames are important components in
telecommunications systems as an interface between optical fiber feeder (trunk) and
distribution (transmission) cables. Typically, the feeder cables are fed into each tray
of the frame from the back or side of the tray in the form of bundled fibers covered
by protective tubing. The individual fibers are spliced to fiber pigtails on a splice
tray, and optical connectors on the opposite ends of the pigtails are mounted in a
panel near the front of the tray (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,211 and U.S. Pat. No.
4,898,448). Jumper cables are optically connected to the pigtail fibers by means of
the connectors at the front of the trays for optical connection to other equipment.In such frames, it is desirable to provide as high a density of fibers and
connectors as possible while still permitting easy access to the connectors and splice
trays for proper maintenance. For access purposes the fiber trays are usually slidable
within a shelf, and can include a drop-down portion for access to the connectors (see,
e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,129,030 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,211). US-A-4911662 discloses a distribution frame having a termination shelf for a
telecommunications cable.The use of movable trays can create problems as to how or where excess fiber can be
stored within the apparatus, especially in high density applications. A further concern
is how to protect the connectors and splices in a manner consistent with easy access.In lightguide cross-connection applications typically used in central offices, the feeder
cables are fed into the trays from the back. However, for interconnection applications
such as typically used for cable television, the feeder cables are usually provided in
the front of the trays.It is the object of the present invention to provide an optical fiber distribution tray
which can receive a cable from the front or back or the frame and which provides
protection for the cable.This object is achieved by an optical fiber distribution tray according to claim 1. In accordance with one aspect, the invention is an optical fiber
distribution tray adapted for slidable mounting within a shelf of a distribution frame.
Each tray includes a front and rear portion. The rear portion includes a plurality of
optical connectors. The front portion includes means for distributing optical fibers
coupled to said connectors and comprises a base member and a front surface

<CLAIMS>
An optical fiber distribution tray (20) adapted for slidable mounting
within a shelf (51) of a distribution frame (10) comprising:


a rear portion (22) including a plurality of optical connectors (32);
a front portion (21) including means for distributing optical fibers
coupled to said connectors comprising a base member (37) and a front surface (38)

essentially perpendicular thereto, the base member being mounted by means of
hinges (44-47) to the rear portion of the tray; and

   
CHARACTERIZED BY

   a cover (43) mounted by means of hinges (40-42) to the front surface of
the distributing means so as to be essentially parallel to the base member in a closed

position and provide protection for the fibers and connectors.
The tray according to claim 1 wherein the front portion is capable of
dropping down at an angle to the rear portion when the tray is slid at least partly out

of the shelf and the cover is rotated so as to provide access to the connectors.
The tray according to claim 1 wherein the front portion is latched to
the rear portion so as to permit the front and rear portion to lie in essentially the

same plane when the tray is slid out of the shelf.
The tray according to claim 1 wherein the front portion is removably
mounted to the rear portion.
The tray according to claim 1 wherein the distributing means further
comprises a plurality of posts (39) mounted to the base member to provide strain

relief for the fibers.
The tray according to claim 1 wherein the rear portion includes a
second base member (23) and a platform (24) mounted thereon with a gap

therebetween which forms a compartment (25) having a sufficient size to permit
optical fibers (26) coming into the tray from the shelf to be stored therein.
The tray according to claim 6 wherein a splice tray (30) is mounted to
the top of the platform (24) for splicing said incoming fibers to pigtail fibers (31)

also mounted on the platform.
