<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the effect of the friction forces during direct contact with the pipeline wall, the supply hose (4) is provided with supporting elements (9) of annular design which are fitted with rolling elements (10) projecting from the peripheral surface of the supporting element. A transport unit (5) is flange-mounted on a fitting (2) of the pipeline (1).

<CLAIMS>
Device for testing and/or working a pipeline (1),
in particular a pipeline having at least one pipe bend

(8), from the inside, an inspection and/or tool head (3)
being movable in the pipeline by means of a drive (6),

and a feed hose (4) starting from the inspection and/or
tool head and leading out of the pipeline, characterized

in that the feed hose (4) is formed from a multiplicity
of supporting bodies (9) of annular design and

intermediate pieces (15) connecting the supporting bodies
(9) to one another, and in that the supporting bodies (9)

and/or the intermediate pieces (15) are fitted with
rolling elements (10) projecting from their peripheral

surface.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the drive is a transport unit (5) arranged outside

the pipeline (1).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the transport unit (5) accommodating the drive

(6) is arranged on a flange of a fitting (2) incorporated
in the pipeline (1).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the inspection and/or tool head is fitted with

rolling elements (10).
Device according to Claim 1 or 4, characterized
in that the rolling elements (10) are deep-groove ball

bearings which are held by pins (14) extending
transversely to the longitudinal axis of the transport

body (9).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the peripheral surface of the supporting body (9) 

facing the pipeline wall is of spherical design.
