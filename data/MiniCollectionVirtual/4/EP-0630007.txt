<ABSTRACT>
An optical information-recording medium includes a 
substrate, and a lower protective layer, a recording layer, 

an upper protective layer, and a reflective layer, formed 
on the substrate. The recording layer exhibits different 

optical properties dependent on different thermal histories 
of a rise and a fall in temperature caused by irradiation 

of a laser beam on the substrate. The optical information-recording 
medium has a layer structure constructed such 

that reflectivity of the optical information-recording 
medium and the phase of light reflected therefrom vary with 

the change in the optical properties of the recording 
layer, with absorptivity of light of the recording layer 

being larger when the recording layer is in a crystalline 
state than when the recording layer is in an amorphous 

state, and at the same time, reflectivity exhibited when 
the recording layer in the crystalline state being 10 % or 

higher. The reflective layer has a thickness set such that 
a value of reflectivity of the reflective layer exhibited 

in the form of a single layer is 90% or more of a value of 
reflectivity of a bulk form of a substance of the 

reflective layer, or to a value of 40 nm or larger.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical information-recording
medium for recording information by utilizing changes in
optical properties thereof induced by different thermal
histories of a rise and a fall of temperature caused by
irradiation of a laser beam thereon, i.e. a phase change
optical disk.An optical disk for recording and reproducing information
by the use of a laser beam now draws attention as a large-capacity
portable file memory, and a ROM-type, a direct
read after write-type, and a writable-type magneto-optical
disks have already been put into practical use. As a type
of optical disk which permits overwriting, a phase change
optical disk, an exchange coupled magneto-optical disk, and
a magnetic field modulation magneto-optical disk are known.
Among them, the phase change optical disk is adapted to
perform recording and erasing by a change in the optical
properties thereof induced by a thermal history of a rise
and a fall of temperature caused by irradiation of a laser
beam thereon. That is, this type of optical disk is
adapted to record information or overwrite new information
on old one, by modulating optical energy irradiated thereon
between two intensity levels correspondent to two states
thereof which can be optically discriminated from each
other. Hereinafter, of the two energy (intensity) levels,
the higher level will be referred to as a recording power
level, while the lower level as an erasing power level.
Reproduction of information is performed normally by 
detecting changes in reflectivity or transmittance between
the two states.To improve the recording density of the optical disks, a
mark edge recording method in which information is imparted
to both ends of each recording mark is now under study or
development. A recording medium used in the phase change
optical disk is generally higher in absorptivity when it is
in the amorphous state than when it is in the crystalline
state, and therefore, in performing overwriting by the mark
edge recording method, the length or position of each
recording mark recorded varies depending on whether the
recording mark is recorded on the amorphous state or on the
crystalline state, and this results in degraded overwriting
characteristics, such as increased recording jitter, and a
lower erasability resulting from modulation of an
overwriting signal, which occurs in dependence on the
existing or recorded information. Further, when taking
into consideration the fact that more latent heat is
consumed in fusion and the thermal conductivity is larger
in
