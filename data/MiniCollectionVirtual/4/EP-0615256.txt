<ABSTRACT>
A solution of monomers, oligomers or polymers and a suitable oxidation 
agent can be stable if the solution also comprises a base. By spin coating this solution 

onto a substrate, a layer can be formed which, after patterned irradiation, yields a 
pattern of a doped conductive polymer which is formed 
in situ
, the exposed and 
unexposed areas exhibiting a large difference in conductivity. A description is given of, 


inter alia
, the patterned irradiation of a layer of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. If desired, 
the conductive polymer pattern can subsequently be metallized in an electroplating bath. 

The method provides, 
inter alia
, a simple process of manufacturing metal patterns on 
insulating substrates, such as printed circuit boards.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a pattern of an
electrically conductive polymer on a substrate surface, a solution from which the
conductive polymer is formed being provided on the substrate surface as a liquid layer,
after which said liquid layer is optionally dried, exposed to patterned radiation and then
heated, thereby forming the pattern of electrically conductive polymer. The invention
also relates to the metallization of such a pattern.In general, organic polymers are electrical insulators and are therefore
used as insulation material in electrical and electronic components. It is known that the
polymer can become electrically conductive if it comprises a poly-conjugated bond
system consisting of a chain of, for example, double bonds, triple bonds, aromatic or
hetero-aromatic rings. This conductivity is referred to as intrinsic conductivity.
Examples of such polymers are polyacetylene, polythiophene and polypyrrole. The
conductivity of these polymers is generally low, since said polymers are semiconductors
with a relatively large band gap of 1.5-4 eV. The conductivity can be increased by, for
example, (electro)chemically oxidizing the polymer, termed doping, resulting in the
formation of p-type conductors. Suitable dopants for obtaining p-type conductance are,
for example, I2, AsF5, SbF5, HBF4, perchlorates, sulphonates, SO3 and FeCl3. This
doping causes the formation of positive charge carriers on the polymer chains, which
charges are compensated by negatively charged counterions.In general, polymers are cheap and can be provided on a substrate by
means of simple techniques, such as spin coating. Consequently, conductive polymers
are attractive for use in conductive and semiconductive structures in (integrated)
electronic circuits, printed circuit boards, anti-static coatings and electromagnetic
protective layers. To realise completely organic electronic systems, interconnects based
on conductive polymers must be available.A method of manufacturing a pattern of an electrically conductive
polymer is known from European Patent Application EP-A-399299. In said known
method, a mixture of a conjugated polymer, such as polyaniline, a radiation-sensitive 
onium salt and a solvent is provided on a substrate surface. After heating, the substrate
surface is exposed to patterned radiation with, for example, UV light and heated again.
An example of an onium salt is triphenylsulphonium hexafluoroantimonate. As a result
of said exposure to radiation, the onium salt generates free acid which
