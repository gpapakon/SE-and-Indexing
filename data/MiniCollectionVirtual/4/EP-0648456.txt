<ABSTRACT>
A shelving for exhibiting shoes, comprising 
squares (2) defined by uprights (4) and floors (3), 

wherein said squares (2) are high, narrow and 
comparatively deep to exhibit shoes therein arranged 

vertically with the tip turned upwards. 
It is particularly envisaged that it has a 
characteristic of composability, that is to say it is 

made up from boards (3, 4) with complementary 
indentations (3', 4') for a reciprocal jointing ad right 

angles to form the squares (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shelving 
for exhibiting shoes. As is known, to exhibit shoes use is presently 
made of structures upon which the shoes are exhibited 
resting with the sole and the heel thereof, arranged as 
if they were put on. A disadvantage of this is that the shoes are 
only observed in profile, so losing the vision of the 
body of the shoe. The present invention puts itself the object 
of providing an exhibitor of shoes that overcomes such a 
disadvantage. Such an object is achieved with a shelving for 
exhibiting shoes according to the accompanying 
independent claim 1. Its feature consists in the fact that with it 
the shoes can be exhibited arranging them vertically, 
showing the public the part of the vamp with the view of 
its inside as if it were viewed from above without being 
put on. Particularly preferred embodiments of the 
present invention are set forth in the subclaims. Therefore, the present invention relates to a 
shelving for exhibiting shoes, comprising squares 
defined by floors and uprights, wherein said squares are 
high, narrow and comparatively deep to exhibit shoes 
therein arranged vertically with the tip turned upwards. It is particularly envisaged that it has a 
characteristic of composability, that is to say it is 
made up from boards with complementary indentations for  
 
a reciprocal jointing at right angles to form the 
squares. The present invention will be best understood 
based upon the following detailed disclosure of its 
preferred embodiment, given only as a matter of example, 
absolutely not of restriction, with reference to the 
annexed drawings, wherein: 
figure 1 is a front view of the shelving for 
exhibiting shoes according to the present invention; figure 2 is a perspective view that 
illustrates the detail of a square of such a shelving, 
and figure 3 is a view that illustrates the 
system for assembling the shelving according to the 
present invention. As can be observed in figure 1, the shelving 
for exhibiting shoes according to the present invention 
comprises a framing 1 in which a matrix of squares 2 
specified by crossed floors 3 and uprights 4 is housed. The height of the squares is greater than the 
width thereof. As can be observed in figure 2, the depth of 
such squares 2 is lesser than the width thereof. In such squares the shoes can be exhibited in 
a vertical position, with the sole and the heel thereof 
against the background of the squares, with the tip 
turned upwards. The high, narrow and comparatively deep 
profile
