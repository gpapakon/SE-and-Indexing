<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF PREVENTING GREASE BUILDUP IN DUCTWORKTechnical Field This invention relates to a method for preventing the adherence and ultimate buildup of grease and other grime in vent hoods and exhaust vent ductwork.In particular, this invention is useful in preventing the buildup of grease and grime and facilitating in the removal of grease and grime from exhaust vent hoods as are commonly used in commercial and institutional kitchens. In commercial and institutional kitchens, it is necessary to vent fumes, smoke, etc., which are generated during the cooking process. Associated with these fumes an smoke are elements of grease and grime which are airborne solids or are volatilized until they contact the relatively colder surfaces of the hoods and vents. Also, certain amounts of grease and grime are also carried along as finel suspended particulate matter in smoke, etc.Vent hoods and the associated ducts and fans must be kept clean or otherwise grease and grime which accumulates therein can buildup, increasing the danger of grease fires which can start in the hoods and vent ducts.The cleaning out of these hoods and vent ducts is a difficult and laborious process, often requiring the physic scraping of the hoods and ductwork to remove the baked-on grease and associated grime or the use of very caustic materials along with high pressure power washing systems.Summary of the Invention This invention relates to a method of preventing the buildup and associated grime in vent hoods and the associate ductwork by coating the ductwork and vent hoods with a thin film of a removable non-hygroscopic coating which also is repellent to the adherence of grease and which enables the vent hood and duct work to be cleaned using much less effor in some cases as simply as using an alkaline cleaner in a spray bottle with a wiping cloth.Summary Disclosure of Invention The present invention relates to a method of preventing the buildup of grease and grime from vent hoods and ductwork 

 comprising coating the vent hoods and ductwork with a thin continuous removeable coating of a grease repelling composition comprising from about 2 to 17% by weight of a lo molecular weight alkali resin; from about 0.07 to 0.6% by weight of a temporary metal crosslinking agent selected from the group consisting of zinc oxide and zirconium oxide; sufficient ammonium hydroxide to substantially neutralize th resins; about 2 to 10% by weight of a coalescing solvent; about 3.5 to 13.5% by weight of a high molecular weight acrylic emulsion polymer;
