<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention comprises a 
presser which acts on the printing cylinder (R) with the 

interposition of a strong membrane (4) of elastomeric 
material, securely fixed, at least with its longitudinal 

edges, to corresponding supports of the presser bar (1). 
During the active phase of the operation of the presser, 

the membrane (4) is subjected to composite compressive, 
bending, tensile and other stresses, as a result of 

which the membrane acts on the printing cylinder (R) 
with a distributed pressure. On the cessation of contact 

with the cylinder (R), the membrane (4) returns by its 
own elasticity to its extended resting state. In 

combination with the elasticity of the membrane, 
advantage is preferably taken of the effect of pneumatic 

counter-pressure (110) to which the membrane is 
subjected when it is mounted with an air-tight seal on 

a corresponding chamber (3) of the presser bar (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for the automatic 
cleaning of the rubber-covered cylinders, 
hereinafter referred to as the printing cylinders, of 
printing machines, of the offset or other type. Devices 
of this type are known from European patent applications 
0025806, 0291745 and 0299193, and from the 
document US-A-4.344.361, all of which provide for the 
supply of liquid detergent to a cloth unwound from a 
reel and taken up on a powered roller. This cloth, with 
the detergent, is pressed against the printing cylinder 
which is to be cleaned by means of a presser parallel to 
the generatrix of the said cylinder. The devices known 
from the above documents are distinguished from each 
other essentially in the different types of pressers 
used, which may consist of a brush or an elastic 
membrane which seals a chamber into which compressed air 
is introduced to deform the membrane so that it presses 
the cloth against the cylinder to be cleaned. The 
presser may also be formed from a rubber bar fixed with 
uniformly distributed contact on a rigid bar which is 
moved parallel to the axis of the printing cylinder. In 
this case, advantage is taken of the elasticity of the 
rubber in compression. Another presser, known from Italian patent application 
B092A-000092, combines the advantages of the 
preceding known solutions, without having their defects,  
 
and consists of a strong rubber membrane fixed in an 
air-tight way on a chamber in which atmospheric pressure 
is present initially, and which is formed in a rigid bar 
which, on command, is moved by suitable means parallel 
to the axis of the printing cylinder. In the course of 
the production of such a presser, certain modifications 
and improvements which form the subject of the present 
patent application were found to be useful; these relate 
to a special system of fixing the elastic membrane to 
the rigid supporting bar, which enables the transverse 
elasticity of the membrane to be exploited to the full, 
on its own or in combination with the counter-pressure 
following the reduction in volume of the air chamber 
sealed in an air-tight way by the said membrane. Other 
improvements consist in a special geometry of the 
elastic membrane and of the chamber sealed by the 
membrane, including as a function of the extension of 
the contact surface of the membrane with the printing 
cylinder. The present patent application is also intended to 
protect a special structure for supporting and guiding 
the presser and for supporting the cleaning fluid
