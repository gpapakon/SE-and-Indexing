<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve mechanism, notably to 
a spool valve for use in an hydraulic ram. In many forms of pile driver, a heavy weight is raised by means 
of an hydraulic ram and allowed to fall onto the top of the 
pile so as to drive it into the ground. Alternatively, as 
described in DE-A-2400925, the reciprocating piston of the ram 
can act directly on the pile or other item without the need for 
a weight. Typically, as described in DE-A-2400925, the ram will comprise 
a piston reciprocated in a cylinder under the influence of high 
pressure hydraulic fluid whose flow to and from the cylinder is 
controlled by a sleeve valve. The sleeve valve is journalled 
for axial movement upon the cylinder wall to control the flow 
of fluid to and from the cylinder. One end of the sleeve valve 
extends into a position control chamber and provides a radially 
extending face upon which the pressure of the fluid in the 
chamber can act. The axial position of the sleeve valve is 
controlled by selectively feeding high pressure fluid to or 
venting fluid from the chamber. In many cases, the operator needs to be able to move the pile 
driver over the ground so as to locate the driver at various 
positions where piles are to be driven. This is often done by 
mounting the weight upon a frame carried as a sliding fit upon 
a mast structure on a crawler or other mobile base, with the 
hydraulic ram located at or near the top of the mast or the 
frame so that it acts directly along the line of rise and fall 
of the weight. However, this layout means that the maximum 
length of pile which can be handled without an excessively tall 
mast is reduced by the combined length of the weight and the 
hydraulic ram, together with the length of the lift stroke of  
 
the ram. In order to reduce the combined length of the ram and weight, 
one could form the weight with an axial recess into which the 
lower end of the ram nests when the weight is fully raised. 
However, with the presently available forms of hydraulic ram, 
the overall diameter of the ram body and associated pipework 
for feeding hydraulic fluid to and from the cylinder of the ram 
is often 70 cms or more. This is typically the diameter of the 
hammer weight itself, so that this concept is impractical for 
many pile driver designs. We have now devised a form of valve mechanism for a hydraulic 
ram which enables a ram of a reduced diameter for a given lift 
performance to be produced, thus enabling the ram to nest 
within the hammer weight. Accordingly,
