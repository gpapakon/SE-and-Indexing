<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator door assembly (11) is mounted on a stationary frame 
(10) of a refrigeration unit and comprises a door frame (15) integrally 

molded about a thermo-pane (14) in sealing relationship therewith. The 
door frame is hingedly mounted on the stationary frame (10) of the 

refrigeration unit by a pair of upper and lower hinge pins (16,17). A 
torsion bar (19), integrally molded within the door frame (15) and 

secured to one of the hinge pins (16), functions to constantly apply a 
closing force on the door frame (15) to move the door assembly (11) into 

sealing contact with the stationary frame (10) of the refrigeration 
unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a refrigeration
unit and more particularly to a unitized refrigerator door
assembly therefor.Conventional window-type door assemblies for
refrigeration units of the type used in supermarkets and
the like comprise a frame having a thermo-pane mounted
therein. The frame is composed of extruded aluminum frame
members secured together by corner brackets. The thermo-pane
normally comprises a pair of glass plates suitably
spaced apart by spacer members disposed about the
peripheries of the plates. An elastomeric gasket is
secured between the frame and the edges of the plates in a
conventional manner.Standard door assemblies of this type are expensive to
fabricate and assemble due to the large number of component
parts involved and the labor intensive steps required for
the assembly process. Further, a relatively high thermal
conductivity 15 exhibited by the aluminum frame that
induces undue conduction of heat within the refrigeration
unit. In addition, an electrical heating system is
normally required to prevent condensation on the glass
plates composing the thermo-pane. The door assemblies also
normally require the consumer-customer to close them 
manually, after it they have been opened for product
procuring purposes.An object of this invention is to overcome the
above, briefly described problems encountered with
conventional door assemblies for refrigeration units by
providing an economical refrigerator door assembly that
exhibits a high degree of structural integrity and
efficiency when placed in operation.
This is achieved by a refrigerator door assembly having the features
of claim 1.In US-A-4084347, a door assembly which may be
used with a refrigerator comprises a door frame and
aligned hinge pins molded within the door frame for
mounting the door assembly for pivotal movement about a
common pivot axis on a stationary frame of a
refrigeration unit, and in US-A-4753043,
which discloses a refrigerator door assembly which has the
features of the preamble of claim 1,
a torsion means
functions to constantly apply a closing force on the
door assembly. In contrast, in the present invention,
while both the hinge pins and the torsion means is
molded in the door assembly during moulding, the hinge
pin(s) to which the torsion means is connected is
twistable in the finished frame.In still another aspect of this invention, a
method for making the refrigerator door assembly is 
taught which includes injecting a liquified thermo
plastic or thermosetting plastic material into a

<CLAIMS>
A refrigerator door assembly (11) adapted to be
mounted on a stationary frame (10) of a refrigeration

unit comprising:

a door frame (15);
aligned hinge pins (16,17)located in said door
frame (15) for mounting said door assembly (11) for

pivotal movement about a common pivot axis (X) on the
stationary frame (10) of said refrigeration unit,
torsion means (18) connected to at least one of
said hinge pins (16,17) for constantly applying a

closing force (F) on said door frame (15) to pivot said
door assembly (11) about said common pivot axis (X),

characterized in that:
said door frame (15) is molded,
said hinge pins (16,17) are embedded in said
molded door frame (15) during its molding,
said hinge pin (16) connected to said torsion
means (18) is twistable within the door frame (15)

after the door frame (15) has been allowed to cure and
harden, 
said torsion means (18) is embedded within said
molded door frame (15) during its molding.
A refrigerator door assembly according to claim
1 wherein said torsion means comprises a torsion bar

(19).
A refrigerator door assembly according to claim
2 wherein one of said hinge pins is an upper pin (16)

having an upper end projecting beyond an upper end of
said door frame (15) and wherein an upper end of said

torsion bar (19) is secured to a lower end of said
upper pin.
A refrigerator door assembly according to claim
3 wherein the other of said hinge pins comprises a

lower pin (17) having a lower end projecting beyond a
lower end of said door frame (15).
A refrigerator door assembly according to claim
3 or claim 4 wherein a main body of said torsion bar is

disposed on said common pivot axis (X) and a lower end
of said torsion bar is bent to provide an anchoring leg

(21) disposed transversely relative to said axis.
A refrigerator door assembly of claim 5 further
comprising a sheath means (22) covering the main body 

of said torsion bar (19) for permitting the main body
of said torsion bar to twist relative to said door

frame.
A refrigerator door assembly of any one of the
preceding claims comprising adjustment means (23) for

selectively setting the magnitude of said closing
force.
A refrigerator door assembly according to any
one of the preceding claims further comprising a

thermo-pane (14) integrally molded in sealing
relationship within said door frame (15), said thermo-pane

comprising a pair of spaced-apart window panes
(37) and a sealing strip (38) disposed between and

about the periphery of said window panes, said sealing
strip being molded within said door frame.
A method for making a refrigerator door
assembly according to claim 1 including comprising:


placing aligned hinge pins (16,17) in a mold
cavity defining the shape of a door frame (15);
securing a torsion means (18) to at least one
of said hinge pins and coating the said pin(s) with a

release agent; 
injecting a liquid plastic material into said
mold cavity around the pins and torsion means to form a

door frame in which said torsion means and pins are
molded; and
curing and hardening said plastic material to
form a structurally integrated refrigerator door

assembly (11) including said pins (16,17) and said
torsion means (18), said coated pin(s) secured to the

torsion means being twistable within the cured and
hardened frame.

positioning a thermo pane (14) having a pair of
spaced-apart window panes (37), having a static thermal

sealing strip (38) therearound, in said mold cavity;
and
injecting the liquid plastic material to
integrate also the thermo pane (10) in the frame.
