<ABSTRACT>
A composite of a flexible, releasable backing 
having a particularly thin, sulfur vulcanizable, 

carbon black filled, adhesive rubber composition strip 
in a form of a coating thereon for application to a 

tire tread splice where the adhesive composition 
comprises a rubber composition containing a sulfur 

curative together with carbon black, processing oil, 
resin and, optionally, rosin oil. The invention is 

further directed to a method of preparing a tire 
having a tread with its ends joined together with said 

adhesive rubber composition strip being applied to the 
tread splice from its flexible backing and to a tire

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite of a 
flexible, releasable backing having a particularly 
thin, sulfur vulcanizable, carbon black filled, rubber 
based adhesive composition in a form of a strip as a 
coating thereon. Such thin composite, or strip, is to 
be used for application of the adhesive composition to 
a rubber tire tread splice. The invention also 
relates to a method of preparing tire treads and to a 
tire with tread prepared thereby. Rubber tires are often prepared in a 
manufacturing process by first building a tire carcass 
and then building a tire tread thereover. The tire 
tread is conventionally applied to the tire carcass as 
a relatively flat, wide, sometimes somewhat contoured, 
uncured rubber strip which is wound around the carcass 
with the ends of the rubber strip meeting to form a 
splice. The ends of the rubber tread strip are 
usually skived, or cut at an angle, so that the 
spliced ends overlap each other. Such procedural 
constructions are well known to those having skill in 
such art. Generally it is desired that the uncured rubber 
tread strip has a degree of tackiness, sometimes 
referred to as building tack, so that the tread splice 
holds together after its construction and is suitable 
for the subsequent tire cure step. However, the uncured tread strip often does not 
have sufficient natural building tack for such 
purpose.  
 Therefore, an adhesive is often applied to the faces 
of the opposing surfaces of the tire tread strip so that 
they have sufficient building tack and so that the 
indicated tread splice can become more secure. For this 
operation, it is common to apply a solvent-based adhesive 
rubber composition - usually referred to as a cement - to 
one, and sometimes both, faces of the opposing tire tread 
splice ends. Examples of various cements for such purpose and 
tread splices joined by a rubber composition, in general, 
may be referred to in one or more of US-A- 3 335 041; 
3 421 565; 3 342 238; 3 514 423; 4 463 120 and 4 539 365. 
It is readily observed that such exemplary cements are 
typically based on, for example, solvent solutions of 
compositions comprised of, for example, a base rubber, 
hydrocarbon oil, carbon black, tackifier resin and 
curative. However, for a number of purposes, it is desired to 
provide a tire tread splice adhesive which can suitably 
be utilized without the aid of a solvent based rubber 
composition. In other words, a dry adhesive composition 
is desired. Preparation and use of a dry adhesive (without 
solvent) is, in

A composite of a flexible, releasable backing 
characterized by having a sulfur vulcanizable, carbon 

black filled, adhesive rubber composition coating in a 
form of an adhesive rubber strip, thereon, where the 

adhesive rubber composition is comprised of, based on 100 
parts by weight rubber; 


(A) 35 to 70 parts by weight (phr) cis 1,4-polyisoprene 
natural rubber and, correspondingly, 30 to 65 phr of at 

least one of synthetic cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber and 
cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber; 
(B) up to 10 phr of styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber;

rubber composition strip has a thickness of 25-152 Âµm (1 

to 6 mils). 
The composite of claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
adhesive rubber strip contains not more than 2 phr of a 

total of stearic acid, waxes, peptizers and 
antidegradant(s) based on paraphenylene diamine if it 

contains any of such ingredients.

unvulcanized rubber tread strip circumferentially around 
an unvulcanized rubber carcass, joining the ends of said 

tread strip with the unvulcanized adhesive rubber 
composition strip of any of claims 1-3 and vulcanizing 

the resulting assembly under conditions of heat and 
pressure; wherein said unvulcanized adhesive rubber 

composition strip is applied to one tread strip end from 
a releasable flexible backing following which the
