<ABSTRACT>
A purified antigen of T. gondii having a molecular weight of 54-kDa (as determined by Western blotting) is provided which is reactive with antibodies raised against a recombinant protein obtained by expression of a defined T. gondii cDNA (Figure 2) in a host cell; also provided are immunogenic fragments of the 54-kDa antigen. Recombinant DNA encoding the 54-kDa antigen, host cells for expression of such DNA, a vaccine for treating or preventing toxoplasmosis infection in humans and animals, and test kits for detection of T. gondii antigen or antibody are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
CloÏ€lng and expression of a protein antigen of toxoplasma gondii.This invention relates to a novel protein capable of inducing an immune response protective against infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii and to the cloning and expressing of a gene encoding the said protein. The invention further relates to novel vaccines and novel in- vitro diagnostic methods and kits comprising the said protein and to their use.Toxoplasma gondii is an ubiquitous obligate intracellular protozoan parasite which infects mammals and birds. Although toxoplasmosis is generally clinically asymptomatic in healthy individuals, it may cause severe complications in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. If primary infection occurs during pregnancy, transplacental transmission can lead to abortion or neonatal malformations [for reviews see Remington and Krahenbuhl, 1982; Hughes, 1985] . In AIDS patients, Toxoplasma is recognized as a major opportunistic pathogen. In such immunodeficient individuals, rupture of cysts which persist in the tissues of the host after a primary infection and release of proliferative forms of the parasite may cause severe disseminated toxoplasmosis and/or encephalitis. In approximately 30 percent of Toxoplasma-antibodv-positive patients with AIDS, toxoplasmic encephalitis will develop due to reactivation of their latent infection. Thus, about 25 percent of patients with AIDS in Belgium, France, and Germany and 5 to 10 percent of such patients in the United States will contract toxoplasmic encephalitis (McCabe and Remington, 1988) .The fetus and the newborn are very sensitive to toxoplasmosis. Infection of the mother during pregnancy and transmission to the fetus can lead to miscarriage, birth of abnormal children (especially with ocular and cerebral 

 lesions) , or birth of apparently normal children who will develop grave sequelae months or years later (blindness, mental retardation). Current estimates indicate that 0.1 to 0.9% of newborns are afflicted with congenital toxoplasmosis.Besides its negative impact on human health, the parasite is also detrimental in sheep and pig farming since abortions resulting from the infection lead to relatively important economic losses [Beverley, 1976] . A vaccine for controlling this infectious agent would be of great value and the feasibility of its development is suggested by the fact that primary infection with Toxoplasma results in specific and long-lasting immunity against reinfection [Remington and Krahenbuhl, 1982] . However, no effective and safe
