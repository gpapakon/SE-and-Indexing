<ABSTRACT>
A rotor assembly for processing a liquid comprising a rotor body 
(52) which is rotatable about an axis of rotation (R). The rotor body 

(52) comprises: a channel (116) having a first section for containing 
a liquid and a second section; a capillary tube (140) movably 

positioned within said channel (116), said capillary tube (140) having 
an end portion of a prescribed outer diameter; and a passageway opening 

(134) connecting said first and second sections of said channel (116). 
The said passageway opening (134) is sized so that the surface tension 

of said liquid contained within said first section prevents the passage 
of said liquid through said passageway opening and so that said end 

portion of said capillary tube (140) is insertable through said 
passageway opening (134) and into said first section for extracting a 

sample of said liquid therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The U.S. Government has rights in this invention 
pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC05-84OR21400 with Martin 
Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., awarded by the U.S. 
Department of Energy. This invention is a continuation-in-part application 
of U.S. Patent No. 4,835,106, 
issued May 30, 1989, and entitled ROTOR FOR PROCESSING 
LIQUIDS USING MOVABLE CAPILLARY TUBES. This invention relates generally to a rotor for 
processing liquids. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a rotor with which a number of bioanalytical 
processing steps can be automatically performed on a 
liquid and a method of using the rotor. Rotors for use during the processing of liquids are 
known. One such rotor, described in U.S. Patent 
3,901,658, discloses a rotor assembly for performing 
photometric analyses using whole blood samples. The 
rotor assembly includes a cell sedimentation bowl for  
 
centrifugally separating red blood cells from plasma. 
Following separation, the plasma is displaced from the 
sedimentation bowl, and measured sub-volumes are 
distributed to respective sample analyses cuvettes 
positioned in an angular array about the rotor periphery. 
Another rotor, described in U.S. Patent 4,515,889 is 
utilized for mixing and incubating a sample solution with 
at least one reagent and optically measuring a parameter 
in the incubated reaction mixture. Each step of mixing, 
incubating and measuring is carried out under the 
influence of centrifugal forces generated by the rotation 
of the rotor. Other examples of rotors are set forth in 
the referenced U.S. Patent No. 4,835,106 whose disclosure 
is incorporated herein by reference. Historically, the aliquoting of liquid samples and 
diluents for use in a rotor has been performed by hand 
prior to introduction of the aliquot within the rotor for 
a processing step. It would be desirable to provide a 
rotor wherein a measured amount of aliquot can be 
automatically separated from an excess amount of liquid 
introduced within the rotor without the use of capillary 
tubes, moving parts supported within the rotor or manual 
intervention of an analyst. In addition, transfer of liquids within the rotor 
from one chamber of the rotor to another for processing 
purposes has presented difficulties due to space 
limitations within the rotor which can be dedicated to 
transfer mechanisms. Hence, it would also be desirable 
to provide a rotor wherein liquid can be transferred from 
one character of the rotor to another without the use of 
transfer mechanisms internal of the rotor.
