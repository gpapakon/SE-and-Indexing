<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of switching STM-N signals in a TS'S'TS'S'T switching network in which the number of input and output ports of the centre stage (STS) is, for example, double that of the ports of the input or output stages, whereby the doubled portion is called extra blocks. In the method in accordance with the invention, first a switching solution is obtained for the signals that travel through the time and space switches (TS) of the input side in such a way that in the same time slot of the outputs of the time switches (T) there is not more than one signal that goes to the same output port of the switching network. Thereafter a solution is obtained for the outputs of the space switches (S) of the input side in such a way that to the same centre block (STS) of the centre stage there does not go more than one signal that is to be routed to the same output block (ST). Finally, it is a simple matter to obtain a solution through the centre stage (STS) and the output side (TS).

<DESCRIPTION>
Coupling of SDH signals in a TS'S'TS'S'T1 coupling networkThe invention relates to the use of a TS'S'TS'S'T switching network and especially to a method of switching SDH STM-N signals.Synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) comprises an extensive facility for the transmission of time-divided signals in a telecommunications network. Mention can be made of the recommendation ITU-T G.707, which defines the STM-1 signal of the SDH signals, ie, the signal of the Synchronous Transport Module of the first level. Other defined levels are STM-4, STM-16 and STM-64. The STM-N frame structure (in which N = 1, 4, 16, 64) is defined in the recommendations ITU-T G.708. The STM-1 basic frame is composed of bytes(8 bits). In an STM-1 frame it is possible to transmit units of a subsystem, for example, 63 TU-12 signals, in each of which 2,048 kbit/s signals can be transported. The STM-N frames are assembled into logical multiframes. The SDH signals are formed from signals of the subsystems by the interleaving of bytes. Thus each signal can be separated into its own time slot in the main signal.Digital Cross Connect systems have been defined for SDH (ITU-T Draft Resolutions G.sdcx-l...-3). SDH DXC is capable of connecting, in the manner desired, traffic from different SDH levels. Use of cross connect equipment provides the possibility of forming remote-controlled routings, connecting traffi to reserve routes, connecting traffic from one signal to many signals (broadcasting or copying), etc. Ordinarily, connections through a cross connect device are bidirectional.There exist a variety of different cross connect architectures. A structure that fulfils well the conditions of non-blocking and implementability is a quadratic 

time switch structure, a TxT S structure (Time x Time - Space). Because this time switch structure expands quadratically, in large cross connect units the equipment becomes very large in size. In principle, time switches are memory elements and the space switch is composed of switch elements.A double capacity TST structure, ie, a time - space - time cross connect structure also fulfils well the requirement of non-blocking properties and implementability. The TST structure is better suited to large cross connect units than is the TxT S structure because in a TST arrangement only the size of the space switch increases quadratically. Depending on how the space switch is implemented, its size may nevertheless pose problems in larger cross connect equipment.This kind of problem can be solved by means of a modified
