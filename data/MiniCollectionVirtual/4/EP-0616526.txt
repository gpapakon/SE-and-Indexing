<DESCRIPTION>
 CETYLPYRIDINIUM CHLORIDE AND DOMIPHEN BROMIDE IN ORGANIC SOLVENTTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to oral compositions in the form of microcapsules which reduce oral bacteria and provide long lasting breath protection.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of breath control compositions such as breath mints, mouthwashes, chewing gums, etc. is widespread in most of the developed countries of the world. Another form which has been used are microcapsules containing a flavorant or other breath protection agent. These executions have acceptance due not only to their usefulness away from a place to expectorate mouthwashes but also due to the fact that they can be swallowed when the user does not need any more of the actives or doesn't want the microcapsule in the mouth any longer.Although microcapsules have been used, there are problems associated with incorporating certain breath protection agents/ antimicrobials into the core. Oftentimes the wall of the micro¬ capsule may develop imperfections and cause loss of the contents prematurely. Additionally, the actives may not be easily solubilized in the materials usually present in the core.The prior art discloses a variety of means for providing breath protection and reducing oral bacteria. Included among such means are sprays disclosed in U.S. 3.431.208. March 4. 1969 to Bailev. Particles containing an adhesive member are disclosed in U.S. 3.911.099. October 7. 1975 to Den Fonev et al . Another form is a mouthwash concentrate in a unit dosage cup as disclosed in U.S. 4.312.889. January 26. 1982 to Melshei er. All of these references are incorporated herein by reference.The present inventors have found that by incorporating the breath control/antimicrobial actives into the core of the micro¬ capsule along with organic diluents, problems associated with other microcapsule executions can be avoided. 

 It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved microcapsules.It is another object of the present invention' to provide microcapsules which provide improved breath control and reduce oral bacteria.It is still another object of the present invention to provide improved methods of providing breath control and reducing oral bacteria.These and other objects will become more apparent from the detailed description which follows.All percentages and ratios used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified. Additionally, all measurements are made at 25βC unless otherwise specified.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention in one of

<CLAIMS>
1. Microcapsules suitable for reducing oral bacteria and providing breath protection comprising a shell material suitable for use in the mouth and ingesting and a core composition comprising a breath protection agent/anti¬ microbial selected from the group consisting of quaternary ammonium salts, other cationic salts, copper salts, zinc salts, triclosan and mixtures thereof and an organic diluent.
2. Microcapsules according to Claim 1 wherein the shell material is selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, gelatin, waxes, gums and sugar candies.
3. Microcapsules according to either of Claims 1 or 2 wherein the microcapsule is in the form of a sphere, oblong, disk, a puffed square, or a cylinder and the breath control agent is a quaternary ammonium salt.
4. Microcapsules according to any of Claims 1-3 wherein the microcapsules are in the form of spheres.
5. Microcapsules according to Claim 4 wherein the microcapsules are from about 2mm to about 9mm in diameter and the shell wall thickness is from about 30um to about 2mm.
6. Microcapsules according to any of Claims 1-5 wherein the shell material is gelatin.
7. Use of a breath protection agent/antibacterial in the manu¬ facture of microcapsules for reducing oral bacteria and breath odor in the mouth wherein the microcapsules comprise a shell material suitable for use in the mouth and ingesting and a core composition comprising a breath protection 


 agent/antimicrobial selected from the group consisting of quaternary ammonium salts, other cationic salts, copper salts, zinc salts, triclosan and mixtures thereof and an organic diluent.
8. A manufacture according to Claim 7 wherein the microcapsule shell is made of gelatin.
9. A manufacture according to either of Claims 7 or 8 wherein the breath control/antimicrobial active is selected from the group consisting of cetyl pyridinium chloride, domiphen bromide and mixtures thereof.
10. A method according to any of Claims 7-9 wherein the micro- capsule is in the form of a sphere.
