<ABSTRACT>
A pulsed modulated capacity modulation system for refrigeration, air
conditioning or other types of compressors is disclosed in which suitable valving

is provided which operates to cyclically block flow of suction gas to a
compressor. A control system is provided which is adapted to control both the

frequency of cycling as well as the relative duration of the on and off time periods
of each cycle in accordance with sensed system operating conditions so as to

maximize the efficiency of the system. Preferably the cycle time will be
substantially less than the time constant of the load and will enable substantially

continuously variable capacity modulation from substantially zero capacity to the
full capacity of the compressor. Additional controls may be incorporated to

modify one or more of the motor operating parameters to improve the efficiency
of the motor during periods of reduced load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a system for modulating the
capacity of a positive displacement compressor such as a refrigeration and/or air
conditioning compressor and more specifically to a system incorporating a valving
arrangement for cyclically blocking suction gas flow to the compressor while the
compressor is continuously driven.Capacity modulation is often a desirable feature to incorporate in
refrigeration and air conditioning compressors as well as compressors for other
applications in order to enable them to better accommodate the wide range of
loading to which systems incorporating these compressors may be subjected.
Many different approaches have been utilized for providing this capacity
modulation feature ranging from controlling of the suction inlet flow such as by
throttling to bypassing discharge gas back to the suction inlet and also through
various types of cylinder or compression volume porting arrangements.In multicylinder reciprocating piston type compressors utilizing
suction gas control to achieve capacity modulation, it is common to block the
flow to one or more but not all of the cylinders. When activated, the capacity of
the compressor will be reduced by a percentage nominally equal to the number
of cylinders to which suction gas flow has been blocked divided by the total
number of cylinders. While such arrangements do provide varying degrees of
capacity modulation, the degree of modulation that can be achieved is available 
only in relatively large discrete steps. For example, in a six cylinder compressor,
blocking suction to two cylinders reduces the capacity by 1/3 or 33.3% whereas
blocking suction gas flow to four cylinders reduces capacity by 2/3 or 66.6%.
This discrete step form of modulation does not allow the system capacity to be
matched to the load requirement conditions at all but rather only to very roughly
approach the desired capacity resulting in either an excess capacity or deficient
capacity. As system conditions will rarely if ever match these gross steps of
modulation, the overall operating system efficiency will not be able to be
maximized.Compressors in which discharge gas is recirculated back to suction
offer quasi-infinite step modulation of the capacity depending upon the variation
and complexity of the bypassing means. However, when discharge gas is
recirculated back to suction, the work of compression is lost for that fraction of
the gas recirculated thus resulting in reduced system efficiency. Combinations of
the aforementioned methods enables
