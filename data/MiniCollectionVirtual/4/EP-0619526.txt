<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve characteristics of a light-receiving 
member for electrophotography having a 

photoconductive layer comprising an amorphous silicon 
material and implement a method for facilitating designing 

of a layer structure, the present invention provides a 
light-receiving member which is formed by depositing in 

sequence a photoconductive layer 102 which comprises a 
non-monocrystalline material comprising silicon atoms as a 

main element and a surface layer 103 on a conductive 
substrate 101, wherein the photoconductive layer 102 

comprises at least hydrogenated amorphous silicon which 
contains at least carbon atoms and boron atoms and the 

boron atom content in the photoconductive layer in a 
direction of film thickness is varied in a correlation of 

exponential functions with respect to the carbon atom 
content in the photoconductive layer in the direction of 

film thickness, and a method for producing the light-receiving 
member by forming a layer while controlling a 

charge of a starting gas for the boron atoms in the 
correlation of exponential functions with respect to a 

charge of a starting gas for the carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light-receiving
member which has a sensitivity to electromagnetic waves
such as lights (hereafter means lights in a broad sense of
word such as ultraviolet ray, visible ray, infrared ray, x
ray, γ ray, etc.), more specifically, a light-receiving
member which is important in the field of image formation
by an electrophotographic copying machine or the like and
a method of producing the light-receiving member.In the field of image formation, a photoconductive
material which forms a light receiving layer in a light-receiving
member is demanded to provide a high
sensitivity, a high S/N ratio [optical current (Ip)/dark
current (Id)], an absorption spectrum adapted to spectral
characteristics of irradiated electromagnetic waves, quick
response to lights, and required dark resistance and is
harmless to human bodies during use. Particularly, for a
light-receiving member for electrophotography to be
incorporated in electrophotographic copiers to be employed
at offices as office equipment, pollution-free
harmlessness is an important point.Amorphous silicon (hereafter referred to as "a-Si") 
is a photoconductive material which has been lately noted
afresh from the viewpoint as described above and an
application of amorphous silicon as a light-receiving
member for electrophotography has been disclosed, for
example, in USP No. 4,265,991.Fig. 1 schematically shows an example of a layer
structure of a light receiving layer 104 for
electrophotography wherein 101 is a conductive substrate,
102 is a light receiving layer made of a-Si and 103 is a
surface protective layer. This light-receiving member for
electrophotography is generally made by heating a
conductive substrate 101 to 50 to 400 °C and depositing a
light receiving layer 102 made of a-Si on the conductive
substrate by a film forming method such as a vacuum
depositing method, a sputtering method, an ion plating
method, a thermal CVD method, an optical CVD method and a
plasma CVD method. Particularly, the plasma CVD method,
that is, a method for decomposing starting gases through
glow discharging with a direct current, a high frequency
or microwaves and forming an a-Si deposited film on the
conductive substrate, has been implemented as an
appropriate method.On the other hand, amorphous silicon carbide
(hereafter referred to as "a-SiC") is known for its high
thermal resistance and surface hardness, higher dark
resistance than a-Si and possible variations of an optical
band gap in a range of 1.6 to 2.8 eV in accordance with 
the
