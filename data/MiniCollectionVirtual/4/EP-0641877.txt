<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a false twist crimping machine as
defined in the preamble of claim 1.This type of false twist crimping machine is known from DE-PS
25 30 125.The design of the false twist machine as shown therein is
commonly used today. Along with the automation of the package doff,
it is intended to construct the takeup device of the false twist crimping
machine for operation on both sides. This is known from DE-A 41 49
045.It is therefore the object of this invention to construct a false
twist crimping machine such that the takeup devices can be operated on
both sides, without obstructing the handling of the yarn, which may be
still done by operators as in the past, by employing robots, which are
responsible for the service of the takeup device, in particular the removal
of full yarn packages and/or the supply of empty tubes, and it is intended
to provide for several machines arranged side by side common aisles for
furnishing feed yarn packages to the creels or for removing the textured
yarn packages.The realization of this object is described in claim 1.This realization is directed to a machine, which can easily be
enlarged to a double machine. To this end, the same machine is
arranged in mirror symmetry to a vertical plane, which extends along the
takeup frame in the service aisle designated for the removal of the 
packages, and which is adequately spaced apart from the takeup frame,
so as to permit the passage and possibly the operation of a doffer. A
further advantage of this arrangement, as claimed in claim 1, is that it
permits different yarn paths or threadlines without changing the basic
structure of the machine or double machine, these threadlines enabling a
space-saving positioning of the machine components.The false twist crimping machine permits to manually thread each
yarn, which advances freely, in the feed systems and other treatment
devices. Advantageous, however, is to guide each yarn from the creel
through its own tube to the first feed system associated therewith. On
the one hand, these tubes serve to protect the yarn. However, they also
permit to thread the yarn by means of a suction gun. It is easy to guide
the yarn through the machine by holding the suction gun against the end
of the tubular passageway or yarn guide tube located at the first feed
system and the yarn against the other end, which is located in the creel
as closely as possible to the feed yarn package. This allows to also
avoid that the operator or even the yarn comes into contact with machine
components
