<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for imposing an advertising
message on users of remote terminals associated with on-line terminals, and
more specifically, for displaying an advertising message on a video display
located in a terminal itself and without interruption of the service rendered
by the terminal.In this system, use is made of the fact that all tasks take time even
with the fastest computer on line. This is a natural fact when it is
considered that hundreds if not thousands of terminals are inputting the
main line computer for services and information. Invariably, the information
or services requested by the user is delayed with a message that states,
"working", "please wait" or a pleasant "one moment please". Sometimes a
light will flash to indicate the machine is "working".The present system uses the waiting period normally associated with
all on-line terminals to display a high quality video advertising message to a
ready willing and waiting consumer. This is suggested, without giving any
indication as to how it may be implemented, in an article entitled "The age
of the smart machine", by D. Austin, pages 26-28 of the December 1989
issue of the UK publication BANKING TECHNOLOGY.A review of the conventional automatic teller machines (ATMs) in use
today will show a system having a card transport mechanism for accepting a
credit card having a magnetic stripe, and a key board for use by the user to
input an identifying PIN number. Once this information is inputted to the
system, the mainframe bank computer identifies the user, and allows the
user to select from a variety of services or goods being offered at the
terminal. The system also includes a printer for issuing a receipt document.The present invention is directed to an interactive system for inputting
and accessing information of the basic type disclosed in the aforesaid 
Banking Technology article, and as defined in the precharacterising clause of
claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to provide such a system
which enables advertising information to be input to the terminals for display
as full motion video sequences, remotely, by a commercial advertising
service provider, independently of the provider of the on-line non-advertising
services and associated network.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
interactive system as defined in the characterising clause of claim 1.According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a
method for displaying advertising information at terminals
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An interactive system for inputting and accessing information,
comprising:


a plurality of terminals (38, 40; 58, 60, 64, 66; 70), each comprising
video display means (18, 20; 74, 90), printing means (16; 84) and selection

means (82);
first computer means (36; 56, 62) remote from and connected to said
plurality of terminals for providing on-line services to each terminal, capable

of being accessed by a terminal user;
said selection means being under the control of the user for selecting
desired on-line services at a terminal;
said printing means being operable to print information relating to the
on-line services selected by the user at the terminal on a hard copy in man-readable

form; and
means responsive to a delay in providing the selected on-line services
for causing advertising information to be displayed by said video display

means;

   
characterised in that
:

each terminal includes means responsive to a delay in providing the
on-line services, for generating an interrupt signal;
the video display means of each terminal includes a video storage
medium (18; 74) for storing full motion video sequences of the advertising

information in digitised compressed format, and a high definition video
display unit (20; 90) for displaying the stored video sequences, under the

control of said interrupt signal;
the system further comprises second, commercial computer means
(30; 50) remote from said terminals, for generating a plurality of different

full motion video sequences of said advertising information; and 
means for transmitting said video sequences from the second
computer means ( 30; 50) in digitised compressed format over telephone

lines (32) to said terminals from time to time when required to update the
video sequences stored by the video storage media of the terminals.
A system according to claim 1, in which said stored full motion video
sequences of advertising information are displayed only after the generation

of said interrupt signal.
A system according to claim 1 or 2, in which said video display unit
(20; 90) is capable of displaying full motion high definition video sequences

in full colour.
A system according to claim 1, 2 or 3, in which said video display
unit (20; 90) also displays said on-line services selected by said user.
A system according to any preceding claim, in which said video
display unit (20; 90) is a cathode ray tube for visually displaying video

information.
A system according to any preceding claim, in which said selection
means (82) includes a touch screen overlay operated by the user for

selecting desired information being offered at a terminal.
A system according to any preceding claim, in which said selection
means (82) includes a keyboard operated by the user for accessing a

terminal and selecting desired information being offered.
A system according to any preceding claim, in which said printing
means (16; 84) includes means for printing in both letter format, and strip

format.
A system according to any preceding claim, in which said printing
means 
(16; 84)
 includes means for encoding information in machine
readable format. 
A system according to any preceding claim, in which each terminal
includes:


a magnetic strip card reader for reading recorded information on a
card to uniquely identify the card holder, and
means responsive to said card reader for generating an access signal
for said on-line services.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim, including at least one
server (34; 52, 54) to receive the input from said second computer means

(30, 50) in digitised compressed format, and means for transmitting said
video sequences in digitised compressed format from said at least one server

to a number of terminals local to the server for storage by the video storage
media of said terminals in digitised format.
A method for displaying full color, full motion video sequences of
advertising information at a plurality of terminals (38, 40; 58, 60, 64, 66;;

70), said terminals being connected to a first remote computer (36; 56, 62)
for providing on-line services to the terminals under the control of a terminal

user, each said terminal having video recording (18; 74) and display (20; 90)
capabilities, the method comprising the steps of:


transmitting changeable full motion video sequences of advertising
information in digitised compressed format over telephone lines from a

second remote computer (30; 50) to the plurality of terminals for recording
thereat in digitised compressed format, from time to time, during low phone

use, when the terminals are typically not being used;
selecting at a terminal, desired information offered by the on-line
services which is to be displayed at the terminal;
printing the information selected at the terminal on a hard copy in man
readable form; and 
displaying said recorded full motion video sequences of advertising
information on the video display of the terminal during any delay in

displaying the desired on-line services at the terminal.
