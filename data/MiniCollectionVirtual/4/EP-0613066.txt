<ABSTRACT>
A developing device, for use with a one-component 
developer composed of coloured fine synthetic resin 

toner particles, comprises a vessel (152) for holding 
the developer and a developing roller (154) rotatably 

provided within the vessel for carrying the toner 
particles to the surface of a photosensitive drum (24) 

for development of an electrostatic latent image formed 
thereon. 
The vessel also contains an agitator (160) which 
rotates to agitate toner particles held in the vessel. 

The agitator has an agitating element (160c), which is 
attached to an agitator shaft (160c), and a plate 

element (162e) attached to one end of the shaft outside 
the vessel. To detect lack of toner in the vessel a 

rod-like element (162b) is mounted for rotation 
relative to the shaft and the rod-like element is 

connected to a tongue element (162d) outside the vessel 
so that the tongue element rotates with the rod-like 

element (162b). During rotation of the agitator, when 
there is sufficient toner in the 
vessel the rod-like 
element (162b) is carried around with the agitating 

element, so that the plate element is between the 
tongue element and a photosensor (162f) as the tongue 

element passes through a predetermined position in the 
course of its rotation, and cannot be detected by the 

photosensor. When the toner level is depleted, 
however, the tongue element passes through the 

predetermined position before the plate element and is 
detected by the photosensor. 
Such a lack of toner detector is simple and cost-efficient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to developing 
devices for use in electrophotographic apparatus, 
wherein an electrostatic latent image is visually 
developed by using a one-component developer. The 
present application is a divisional application of 
European patent application no. 90305946.7. (EP-A-0 401 020). As is well known, an electrophotographic 
printer carries out the processes of: producing a 
uniform distribution of electrical charges on a surface 
of an electrostatic latent image carrying body such as 
an electrophotographic photoreceptor; forming an 
electrostatic latent image on the electrically charged 
surface of the electrophotographic photoreceptor by 
optically writing an image thereon, using a laser beam 
scanner, an LED (light emitting diode) array, an LCS 
(liquid crystal shutter) array or the like; visually 
developing the electrostatic latent image with a 
developer, i.e., toner, which is electrically charged 
to be electrostatically adhered to the electostatic 
latent image zone; electrostatically transferring the 
developed visible image to a paper; and fixing the 
transferred image on the paper. Typically, the 
electrophotographic photoreceptor is formed as a 
photosensitive drum having a cylindrical conductive 
substrate and a photoconductive insulating film bonded 
to a cylindrical surface thereof. In the developing process, a two-component 
developer composed of a toner component (colored fine 
synthetic resin particles) and a magnetic component 
(magnetic fine carriers) is widely used, as it enables a 
stable development of the latent image. Note, typically 
the toner particles have an average diameter of about 10 
Âµm, and the magnetic fine carriers have a diameter ten  
 
times larger than the average diameter of the toner 
particles. Usually, a developing device using the 
two-component developer includes a vessel for holding 
the two-component developer, wherein the developer is 
agitated by an agitator provided therein. This 
agitation causes the toner particles and the magnetic 
carriers to be subjected to triboelectrification, 
whereby the toner particles are electrostatically 
adhered to each of the magnetic carriers. The 
developing device also includes a magnetic roller, 
provided in the vessel as a developing roller, in such a 
manner that a portion of the magnetic roller is exposed 
therefrom and faces the surface of the photosensitive 
drum. The magnetic carriers with the toner particles 
are magnetically adhered to the surface of the magnetic 
roller to form a

<CLAIMS>
A developing device for use with a one-component 
developer composed of toner particles, which 

device comprises: 

a vessel (152) for holding the developer; 
means (154) for carrying the developer from 
said vessel to an electrostatic latent image carrying 

body for development of an electrostatic latent image 
formed thereon; 
an agitator (160) having an agitating element 
(160c) that is caused to rotate within said the vessel, 

when the device is in use, to agitate developer held 
therein; and 
means (162) for detecting a lack of developer 
in said vessel; 
characterised in that the detecting means 
(162) include: 
a first element (162b) which is arranged 
within the said vessel and which is acted upon by the 

said agitating element, when that rotates, so as to be 
caused to rotate ahead of the agitating element; 
a second element (162d) connected to the said 
first element so as to rotate therewith; 
a third element (162e) connected to the said 
agitating element so as to rotate therewith; and 
a detector (162f) arranged for detecting 
passage of the said second element through a 

predetermined position in the course of its rotation, 
the device being such that when the developer in the 

vessel is above a predetermined level the resistance of 
the developer to movement of the first element 

therethrough ensures that the second and third elements 
are aligned with one another as the second element 

passes through its said predetermined position in the 
course of its rotation, so that the said third element 

prevents the detector from detecting the passage of the  
 

said second element through the said predetermined 
position, whereas when the developer is below the said 

predetermined level the first element can fall away 
from the agitating element in the course of their 

rotation so that the second and third elements are out 
of alignment as the second element passes through the 

said predetermined position, thereby permitting the 
detector to detect the said passage of the said second 

element through the said predetermined position. 
A developing device as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the said detector (162f) is a photosensor which 

is operable to emit light and to detect a back-reflection 
of the emitted light, the said second and 

third elements (162d, 162e) having reflective and non-reflective 
surfaces respectively, and the said 

photosensor (162f) being oriented towards the said 
predetermined position so that the light emitted 

therefrom is directed perpendicularly onto the said 
reflective surface of the said second element (162d).
