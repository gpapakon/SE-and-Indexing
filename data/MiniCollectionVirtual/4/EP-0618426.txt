<ABSTRACT>
A system for the metering of liquids containing a metering device, a device for actuating the metering device, a device for the input of data and a unit for calculating a metering stroke. Allocated to a metering device according to the invention are data which are characteristic of the internal diameter of the metering device and therefore enable precise metering. Likewise, the invention relates to a method for metering using a system according to the invention.

System (30) for dosing liquids comprising

a dosing device (32) having a syringe body which has a constant inside
diameter (d) over its length and a plunger (31) which forms a seal when it

moves within the syringe body,
a data carrier (6, 14, 37) which stores data that are characteristic for the
individual inside diameter (d) of the syringy body and which have been

determined for the individual syringe body,
a device (33, 34, 35, 36) for moving the plunger (31) in the syringe body,
a reading instrument for reading in characteristic data for the individual
inside diameter (d) of the syringe body,
a device for reading in data for a dosing that is to be carried out
an electronic unit (CPU) for calculating a metering stroke (h) of the plunger
taking into consideration the data that are characteristic for the individual

inside diameter (d) and the data for a dosing to be carried out.
System (30) as claimed in claim 1, in which the data for the inside diameter
(d) of the syringe body are present in the form of a bar code.
System (30) as claimed in claim 1, in which the data for the inside diameter
(d) of the syringe body are present on a magnetic strip or a storage chip.
System (30) as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
data which are characteristic for the inside diameter of the dosing device are

attached to the dosing device (32). 
System (30) as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
data which are characteristic for the inside diameter of the dosing device are

present in a form which can be conveyed to the reading instrument and are
spatially separated from the dosing device (32).
System (30) as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the dosing device (32)
is filled with liquid and sealed.
System (30) as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 it has a device to
break open the seal of a dosing device (32).
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the electronic unit (CPU) uses the
formula


h = 4V/(
Ï€
d
2
)

to calculate the metering stroke (h) of the plunger.
System (30) as claimed in claim 1 with a disposable dosing device.
Process for dosing liquids comprising the following steps:

providing a dosing device (32) having a syringe body which has a constant
inside diameter (d) over its length and a plunger (31) which forms a seal

when it moves within the syringe body,
providing a data carrier (6, 14, 37) which has stored data that are characteristic

for the individual inside diameter (d) of the syringy body and which have
been determined for the individual syringe body,
providing a device (33, 34, 35, 36) for moving the plunger (31) in the
syringe body,
reading in characteristic data for the inside diameter (d) of an individual
syringe body,
reading in data for a dosing that is to be carried out, 
calculating a metering stroke (h) of the plunger taking into consideration
the data that are characteristic for the inside diameter (d) and the data for a

dosing to be carried out
performing the metering stroke (h).
Process as claimed in claim 10, in which the metered liquid is a reagent
solution.
Process as claimed in claim 10, in which the dosing device is discarded after
being emptied.
Process as claimed in claim 10, in which a process step for unsealing the
dosing device proceeds the dispensing of the volume to be dosed.
Process as claimed in claim 10, in which the data for the inside diameter (d)
of the individual syringe body and the contents of the dosing device are

determined once after installing the dosing device within the system.
