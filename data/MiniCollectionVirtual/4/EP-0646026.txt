Protective sleeve which serves for the waste disposal of a used 
disposable cannula and the 
wall of which encloses an elongate receiving 
space (11b; 111b) for the used cannula (9; 109), which space is at 

least as long as the cannula (9; 109) and into which this is 
introducible from the side through a lateral passage which extends over 

its length and which is closed in elastically yielding manner by means 
of a closure wall (10; 110) over at least a part of the length of the 

cannula needle (9b; 109b), wherein a cannula stripper (5, 6; 105, 116), 
which is open to one side truly aligned with the passage, is arranged 

at the one end face of the receiving space (11b; 111b) for engaging 
behind the cannula (9; 109) still plugged onto the syringe (14; 114) and 

introduced into the receiving space (11b; 111b), characterised by a 
spray protection wall (3a, 3b, 6, 7; 103a, 103b, 106, 107), which 

extends over that end region of the passage, which is remote from the 
cannula stripper (5, 16; 105, 116), and externally over this passage 

bounds an introduction space (11a; 111a), which is open towards the 
cannula stripper (5, 16; 105, 116) and closed for the remainder and 

into which the cannula needle (9b; 109b) is introducible over a region, 
which adjoins its tip, through the passage before the pressing-through 

of the cannula (9; 109) and the entry opening of which has a spacing, 
which is smaller than the length of the cannula, from the cannula 

stripper (5, 16; 105, 116). 
Protective sleeve according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that 
the receiving space (11b; 111b) is also arranged for the keeping of an 

unused cannula (9'; 109') with a sterile covering (18; 118), which 
cannula is introducible from the end face through the cannula stripper 

(5, 16, 17; 105, 116, 117) into the receiving space (11b; 111b). 
Protective sleeve according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that 
the cannula stripper (5, 16, 17; 105, 116, 117) is so structured that 

the cannula head (9a; 109a) in the introduced state is clampable at the 
needle tip side against a head (9c; 109c).  

 
Protective sleeve according to claim 1, characterised by a 
receiving chamber (12; 112), which extends parallelly to the receiving 

space (11b, 111b), is separate from this and accessible from one end 
face, for a sterile unused cannula (9'; 109'). 
Protective sleeve according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that 
the receiving chamber (12; 112) is accessible from that end face of the 

protective sleeve, at which the cannula stripper (5, 16; 105, 116) is 
arranged. 
Protective sleeve according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by handle ribs which are formed laterally at the 

protective sleeve at a spacing from the introduction space (11a; 111a) 
for the needle tip. 
Protective sleeve according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by handle lobe (20; 120), which extends laterally with 

respect to the longitudinal axis of the receiving space (11b; 111b), at 
the outward side of the protective sleeve. 
Protective sleeve according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by wall (3a, 3b), which extend outwardly away from the 

passage about parallelly one to the other at a mutual spacing on both 
sides of the passage, for protection against touching the used cannula 

(9) by hand during the manipulation of the protective sleeve. 
Protective sleeve according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that the closure wall (110) as closed cover wall 

reaches from the one side wall (103b), which is connected with it, of 
the protective sleeve to directly in front of its other side wall 

(103a) and that the spray protection wall (103a, 103b, 106, 107) forms 
a slope (107), which extends from the upper side of the entry opening 

(130) of the introduction space (111a) downwardly towards the closure 
wall (110) to that end of the protective sleeve, which is remote from 

the cannula stripper (105, 116).  
 
Protective sleeve according to claim 9, characterised thereby, 
that the slope (107) extends towards the end of the protective sleeve 

to below the height which the closure wall (110) takes up above the 
base (131) of the receiving space (111b). 
Protective sleeve according to claim 9 or 10, characterised 
thereby, that the closure wall (110) in the direction perpendicular to 

its longitudinal extent is sloping downwardly from the side wall 
(103b), which is connected with it, towards the base (131) of the 

receiving space (111b). 
Protective sleeve according to one of the claims 9 to 11, 
characterised thereby, that the closure wall (110) projects somewhat 

into a receiving box (108) for the cannula head (109a) and there forms 
an elastic lobe (110b), which is free towards the sides and the 

receiving box (108). 
Protective sleeve according to one of the claims 9 to 12, 
characterised thereby, that centring dogs (132), which are mounted in 

the protective sleeve at a spacing from the cannula stripper (105, 116) 
in the region of the introduced cannula head (109a), for the centring 

of the needle (109), which is introduced into the receiving space 
(111b), to the centre thereof. 
Protective sleeve according to one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised thereby, that the closure wall (10) in the region of the 

introduced cannula needle (9b) is formed of interengaging elastic 
fingers, which extend one towards the other, adjoin one laterally 

against the other and at the free ends reach to the side walls (3a, 3b) 
of the protective sleeve, similarly to a zip fastener.
