<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of preparing 
a support for a filtration medium comprising passing a 

sheet of nonwoven fibrous polymeric material having first 
and second sides through a calender which comprises a 

nondeformable roll and a resilient roll, the 
nondeformable roll being maintained at a temperature 

below the melting temperature of the material, so as to 
increase the smoothness of the first side of the material 

which contacted the resilient roll. A filtration medium 
support material prepared in accordance with the method 

of the present invention, as well as a filter comprising 
a filtration medium and that filtration medium support 

material, are also provided by the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to support materials 
for filtration media and methods for their preparation. Filtration media have been used for the filtration 
of fine particles from fluids, particularly liquids, for 
many years. Such filtration media are available in a 
variety of materials to meet particular filtration 
requirements. Microporous membranes, such as those 
described in U.S. Patent 4,340,479, are particularly 
well-suited to the filtration of fine particulate matter 
from fluids, especially liquids. Although microporous membranes possess the ability 
to remove fine particles, they unfortunately suffer from 
a lack of mechanical strength. As a result, one or more 
supportive materials are often mated with a microporous 
membrane in order to provide the membrane with an 
adequate degree of mechanical support. This is 
particularly the case when the microporous membrane is 
pleated for use in a filtration element. Support materials of various compositions and 
structures have been used in conjunction with the 
microporous membranes, including, e.g., nonwoven fibrous 
materials such as polyesters and polypropylenes. The 
particular material used in a filtration medium support 
material preferably possesses high strength, good edge 
flow characteristics, and a low pressure drop across the 
material. Nonwoven fibrous materials prepared from 
fibers which are at least about 50 microns in diameter 
provide an exceptional level of performance in each of 
these areas. The use of such nonwoven materials as supports for 
filtration media, especially microporous membranes, 
however, is not without its problems. In particular,  
 
materials prepared from fibers in excess of about 20 
microns in diameter typically possess a relatively rough 
or coarse surface. Thus, when a microporous membrane is 
mated with such a support material, the support material, 
due to its roughness or unevenness, can damage and 
introduce defects into the membrane, particularly when 
such a membrane is pleated. One example of such a defect 
is referred to as "coining." Coining occurs when the 
support material, upon being compressed with a membrane 
during the preparation of a filtration element, leaves a 
permanent imprint of its surface in the membrane. The 
membrane is therefore permanently compressed in the area 
of the imprint, and this compression results in a local 
lessening of the membrane's thickness, which in turn 
reduces the resolution, or titer reduction, of the 
membrane. In a worst case, a support material

A method of preparing a support material for a 
filtration medium comprising passing a sheet of nonwoven 

fibrous polymeric material having first and second sides 
through a calender which comprises a nondeformable roll 

and a resilient roll, the nondeformable roll being 
maintained at a temperature above about 25°C and below 

the melting temperature of the material, so as to 
increase the smoothness of the first side of the material 

which contacted the resilient roll.
