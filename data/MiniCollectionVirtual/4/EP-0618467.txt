<ABSTRACT>
A fiber holding chuck (10) comprising a silica glass rod having a fiber 
groove (18) or fiber chuck for an optical fiber. The optical fiber (20) lies in the fiber 

groove (18), and a clamping mechanism holds the optical fiber (20) in place. The 
fiber holding chuck positions the optical fiber without damaging the fiber in order to 

align the fiber with another fiber. The clamping mechanism maintains the position of 
the aligned fiber. The fiber chuck (10) mounts in a chuck groove (14) of a chuck 

mounting fixture (12). The chuck mounting fixture (12) attaches to a fiber 
positioning mechanism, and the positioning mechanism positions the chuck mounting 

fixture (12) along with the fiber chuck (10) and the optical fiber (20) to align and 
splice two optical fibers together while reducing the risk of damage to the optical 

fiber (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field of fiber optics. 
More particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus for aligning optical fibers so 
that they may be joined to each other by splicing techniques. The field of fiber optics is generally concerned with the transmission of 
light along a transparent fiber structure or core which has a higher refractive index 
than its surroundings. Typically, an optical fiber consists of a core of transparent 
material having a refractive index n1 surrounded by a layer of transparent cladding 
material having a refractive index n2 which is lower than n1. The core and the 
cladding form a guiding region. Usually, the core and guiding region have a circular 
or elliptical shape. Fibers with elliptical cores have a minor and major axis such 
that light travels along one of these axes. Such a fiber is called a polarization-holding 
fiber. The optical fiber can also include an outer protective layer. Currently, it is possible to manufacture long, continuous strands of 
optical fiber which may propagate signals without substantial attenuation over long 
distances. It is also possible to manufacture the fiber structure as a optical 
waveguide wherein only preselected modes of light propagate in the fiber. By 
limiting wave propagation through the fiber to a single mode, the bandwidth of the 
optical fiber may be exceedingly high to provide a high information-transfer capacity. In sensing and control systems, a fiber-optic transducer is used that 
exploits either multi-mode or single-mode light propagation in a optical fiber. 
While multi-mode sensors use amplitude variations in the optical signals to sense and 
transmit the desired information, single-mode sensors use phase variations rather than 
amplitude variations. The single-mode sensors usually involve mechanisms for 
altering such properties of the fiber as path length or index of retraction to effect the 
desired phase variations in the optical signal. Thus, in contrast to multi-mode 
sensors, in single-mode sensors the uniformity and mechanism of light propagation 
and hence the characteristics of the fiber are especially critical. Single-mode sensors are sensitive to the state of polarization of the 
light in the fiber. Thus, for single-mode transducers, it is desirable to use elliptical-core  
 
or other kinds of polarization-holding fiber. See, e.g. McMahon et al, "Fiber-Optic 
Transducers," IEEE Spectrum, December, 1981, pages 24-27. Most of these 
polarization-holding fibers are capable of
