<ABSTRACT>
A controlled release-initiation and controlled
release-rate pharmaceutical composition in which a drug-containing

composition is coated with a membrane layer
comprising a water insoluble high polymer and silicone. The

starting time for the release of drugs from the controlled
release-initiation and controlled release-rate pharmaceutical

composition of this invention and the drug-releasing rate
thereafter can be controlled at will.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a controlled release-initiation
and controlled release-rate pharmaceutical
composition in which the starting time of the release of a
drug from a preparation and the releasing rate of the drug
after commencement of its release can be controlled at will.When a pharmaceutical composition is applied to
patients, it is necessary to guarantee its efficacy and
safety, as well as its specificity corresponding to each
purpose.Because of this, great concern has been directed
toward the development of a system in which a pharmaceutical
composition is designed in such a dosage form that a drug of
interest is delivered to a target site for a necessary period
of time in a required amount.In order to satisfy such a requirement, sustained
release preparations which can give prolonged duration of
action of a drug by controlling the releasing rate of the
drug from the preparation have already been developed and put
into practical use.

160244W disclose pharmaceutical
compositions for controlled release comprising
a drug containing core and a coating
which consists essentially of a water
insoluble high polymer and silicone. However
the quantitave composition of the coating
is different. In addition, other types of
pharmaceutical compositions which can control commencement of
the release of drugs have been proposed in recent years, such
as a preparation in which a drug is released when the coat  
membrane of the preparation is disrupted due to swelling of a
water swelling material (JP-A-62-30709 (corresponding to U.S.
Patent 4,871,549) and JP-A-4-338323; the term "JP-A" as used
herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application"), a preparation in which a water repellent salt
such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or the like
fatty acid metal salt and an acrylic polymer are used in its
coat membrane in order to give the preparation a lag time
before the release of its ingredients (JP-A-4-235123
(corresponding to U.S. Patent 5,137,733)) and a preparation
in which mutual interaction between Eudragit RS (manufactured
by Rohm Pharma GMBH) and an organic acid is applied (Abstract
of Papers, 7th Annual Meeting of The Japanese Society of
Pharmacy, p.84, 1991).However, since drugs are produced with various
purposes, development of a pharmaceutical composition having
various drug release mechanisms which can respond to these
purposes has been called
