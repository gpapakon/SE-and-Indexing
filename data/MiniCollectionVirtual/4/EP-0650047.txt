<ABSTRACT>
A method of detecting the presence or measuring 
the concentration, of a reactive gas in an inert ambient gas 

by (i) placing a silicon dioxide film derived from the 
oxidation of a hydrogen silsesquioxane resin in the inert 

ambient gas; (ii) passing the inert ambient gas over the 
film; (iii) monitoring a change in the current flow through 

the film at a voltage below and above a threshold voltage, 
as an indication of the presence in the inert ambient gas of 

a reactive gas; and (iv) determining the threshold voltage 
of the film as a measure of the concentration of the 

reactive gas in the inert ambient gas. The silicon dioxide 
film is characterized by a current-voltage curve which 

includes both linear and non-linear regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to threshold switching
devices which exhibit negative differential resistance (NDR)
and to certain ceramic threshold switching devices which are
useful in the detection of reactive gases in a fluid stream.Devices which exhibit threshold switching and
metal oxide devices which exhibit threshold switching with
negative differential resistance (NDR), are known in the
art. The switching and negative differential resistance
(NDR) characteristics of silicon oxide films have also been
described in the literature.The use of thin film silica coatings derived from
hydrogen silsesquioxane resin to provide protection and
electrical insulation is not new, but the use of those
coatings to form switching devices which are useful in the
detection of reactive and inert gases is believed to be
novel.Coatings and switching devices formed by
depositing a thin hydrogen silsesquioxane derived silicon
dioxide film between at least two electrodes and applying a
voltage above a threshold voltage across the electrodes, are
described in detail in U.S. Patent 5,312,684 dated May 17,
1994, and entitled "Threshold Switching Devices".Such coatings and switching devices have also been
described in U.S. Patent 5,283,545 dated February 1, 1994,
and entitled "Variable Resistors".The present invention involves these coatings and
switching devices and defines their utility in gas detection
applications. We have found that switching devices with
desirable features can be formed by depositing a thin 
hydrogen silsesquioxane derived silicon dioxide film between
at least two electrodes and by then applying a voltage above
a threshold voltage across the electrodes. These ceramic
devices are useful in the sensing of reactive gases present
in a fluid stream.A device formed in this manner is characterized in
that (i) the conductive state of the device exhibits a
region of stable voltage-controlled negative differential
resistance, (ii) the conductive state can be converted to a
resistive state by decreasing the applied voltage from a
sufficiently high value to a value below a threshold voltage
at a sufficiently high rate, (iii) the device can be
converted from a resistive state to a conductive state by
the application of a voltage above the threshold voltage,
(iv) the presence of a reactive gas in the inert ambient gas
or fluid stream to which the device is exposed induces a
transition from the conductive state of the device to its
resistive state for an applied voltage above a reaction
barrier voltage and (v) the value

A method of detecting the presence of a
reactive gas in an inert ambient gas comprising (a) exposing

part of a film surface to the inert ambient gas; the film
being silicon dioxide derived from the oxidation of a

hydrogen silsesquioxane resin; the silicon dioxide film
being characterized by an electrical current-voltage jV

curve which includes linear and nonlinear regions, the jV
curve of the film including; (i) a first non-linear region

where the current increases with the applied voltage to a
maximum; followed by (ii) a second non-linear region of

negative differential resistance leading to a current
minimum at and beyond which (iii) a third region is reached

from where the rapid decrease of the applied voltage causes
the current to decrease linearly with voltage; the jV curve

of the silicon dioxide film further including (iv) a fourth
region where an increase of the voltage applied to the film

across a threshold value causes a rapid transition of the
current frog the linear region to the first non-linear

reqion (i); (b) electro-forming the film by applying a voltage in
excess of the threshold voltage V
th
; the next step being selected from (c) measuring
the change in the current flow through the film at an

increasing voltage to determine the threshold voltage as a
measure of the concentration of the reactive gas in the

inert ambient gas and (d) measuring the change in the
current flow through the film at a constant voltage above

the reaction barrier voltage
which is the limiting voltage below which the device

does not respond to the presence of the reactive gas,
as an indication of the

presence of the reactive gas in the inert ambient gas. 
A method according to claim 1 in which the
film is purged in an inert atmosphere and the reactive gas

is desorbed from the film prior to placing the film in the
inert ambient gas; and in which the film with the reactive

gas desorbed and purged is sensitized to the presence of a
reactive gas by applying to the film a voltage in excess of

the threshold voltage in an inert atmosphere prior to
placing the film in the inert ambient gas.
A method according to claim 2 in which the
voltage applied to the film is lowered below the threshold

voltage but at a value above the reaction barrier voltage
prior to exposing the film in the inert ambient gas to the

reactive gas.
A method according to claim 3 in which the
film is exposed to the reactive gas in the inert ambient

gas, after which the reactive gas is purged and desorbed
from the film surface; the applied voltage is temporarily

increased to a value above the threshold voltage a second
time in an inert atmosphere in order to re-sensitize the

film; and in which the film is exposed again to the presence
of a reactive gas in the inert ambient gas.
A method according to claim 1 in which the
voltage applied to the film is cycled between a value in or

above the region of negative differential resistance and a
value below the reaction barrier by rapidly decreasing the

voltage and slowly increasing the voltage in order to 
determine the threshold voltage at which the device changes

from the fourth region to the first non-linear region, as
indicated by a rapid and large increase in the current

through the film. 
The method according to claims 1 in which
the inert ambient gas and the inert atmosphere are selected

from nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and helium.
The method of claims 1 wherein the film
is formed by coating a substrate with a solution of hydrogen

silsesquioxane in a solvent, evaporating the solvent to form
a coating and pyrolyzing the coating to form the film.
