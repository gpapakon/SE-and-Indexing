<ABSTRACT>
A process for efficiently manufacturing high purity 

polyarylene sulfide. The process comprises feeding a 
liquid or gaseous sulfur compound (e.g. hydrogen sulfide) 

to a mixture comprising lithium hydroxide and a non-lithium 
hydroxide solid compound (e.g. alkali metal 

chloride or alkaline earth metal chloride) in a non-protonic 
organic solvent (e.g. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), 

separating the alkali metal chloride or alkaline earth 
metal chloride, adjusting the sulfur content of the 

reaction mixture, feeding a dihalogeno aromatic compound 
(e.g. p-dichlorobenzene) to effect a polycondensation 

reaction, and adding of an alkali metal hydroxide (e.g. 
sodium hydroxide) to recover lithium ion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
manufacturing polyarylene sulfide, and, more
particularly, to a process for manufacturing high quality
polyarylene sulfide, useful as a material for electrical
or electronic parts and appliances and as a high rigidity
material, at a low cost.The present invention further relates to a process
for separating a solid compound other than lithium
hydroxide (such a solid compound is hereinafter referred
to as non-lithium hydroxide solid compound), and, in
particular, to a process for efficiently separating a
non-lithium hydroxide solid compound produced in the
process for manufacturing polyarylene sulfide.Furthermore, the present invention relates to a
process for recovering lithium ion, and, in particular,
to a process for efficiently recovering lithium ion from
a reaction mixture of polyarylene sulfide containing
lithium chloride in the process for manufacturing
polyarylene sulfide.Polyarylene sulfide resins (PAS resins), in
particular, polyphenylene sulfide resins (PPS resins), 
are known as engineering plastics having excellent
mechanical strength, heat resistance, and especially high
rigidity. They are useful materials for electrical and
electronic parts and appliances, and as high rigidity
materials for various applications. A conventional
process for manufacturing these resins is reacting a
dihaloaromatic compound such as p-dichlorobenzene
and a sodium salt such as sodium sulfide in an aprotic
organic solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(hereinafter abbreviated from time to time as NMP). A
problem in this process resides in the difficulty in
removing by-produced sodium chloride from resins by
washing, since sodium chloride is insoluble in the
solvents such as NMP and is incorporated in the resins.
A process using a lithium salt instead of the sodium salt
is attracting attention as a process for overcoming this
problem. Because lithium chloride produced as a side
product in the polymerization reaction is soluble in many
of the aprotic organic solvents such as NMP, it is
possible to comparatively easily reduce the lithium
content in the resin.In order to reduce the manufacturing cost of the
resins, however, it is essential to recover and reuse
lithium which is far more expensive than sodium.As a process for manufacturing polyarylene sulfide 
resins, including polyphenylene sulfide resins, using the
lithium salt, USP 4,451,643 discloses a batch or
continuous process for manufacturing these resins by
reacting lithium N-methylaminobutyrate (hereinafter
