<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for and a method 
of controlling the lens position in an 

image scanner in which the density of 
read lines can be varied by selecting one 

of lens. A base is rotatably provided in 
a plane parallel to a table on which an 

original is placed. The lens is supported 
on the base in such a way that the optical 

axis of each lens is parallel to the base 
surface and intersects the rotation axis. 

A reference pattern is provided at a place 
where an image receiving device can read 

it through the lens. On the basis of the 
received image of the reference pattern, 

the lens in the optical path is identified, 
and its position is determined. The 

rotation of the base is thus controlled to 
set an appropriate lens in an appropriate 

position. In such a way, an image 
scanner such that the lens can be changed 

in a high precision is provided without 
increasing the height.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
scanner, and more particularly to an image scanner in
which a reading line density or the like can be converted
by changing over lenses and to a lens position
control structure and method in such an image scanner.A resolving power required in an image
scanner is regarded as being different in accordance
with an original, for example, 400 dpi (dots per inch; 1 inch = 2.54 cm)
for reading an A3-size sketch or the like, 600 dpi for
reading an A4-size document having a high frequency of
use as a simple print original, and 1200 dpi for reading
a transparent original up to 4 x 5 inches.In the conventional method responding to
such requirements, a plurality of kinds of lenses
having different magnifying factors are selectively
used in order to change a line density in an image
scanner. A general structure of a lens change-over
structure in such an image scanner includes, for example,
a structure in which each lens is mounted on a
slider capable of moving on a rail (see e.g. US-A-5,099,275) so that it is selectively 
positioned in front of an image receiving element
such as a CCD (or charge-coupled device) by
motor-driving the slider or a structure in which each
lens is held on a rotatable disk-like holder (see e.g. EP-A-0 450 552) so that it
is selectively positioned in front of an image receiving
element by motor-driving the holder. In such a
structure, the positioning of the lens for the image
receiving element is made using a limit switch or a
proximity sensor.However, the lens as mentioned above requires
a high precision for its optical position relationship.
Therefore, for example, in the case of the
type in which the slider holding each lens thereon is
linearly moved on the rail, a certain degree of precision
for the installation of the rail is required over
the whole of a moving range of the slider and hence the
rail assembling work is liable to become troublesome.
Also, in the image scanner as mentioned above, it is
general that a scanning unit scans along a horizontal
original table mounted with an original sheet and an
image received by a mirror is reflected parallel to the
original table and is then received by the image receiving
element. Accordingly, it is desired in view of
operability that the size of the image scanner in a
direction of height thereof or a direction perpendicular
to the original table should be made as small as
possible. However, in the case of the type in which
the disk-like holder holding each lens thereon is 
rotated, the disk-like

image scanner according to any of claims 1 to 3 

wherein a lens position control
structure comprises a reference pattern (19)

provided at a predetermined position at which it is
readable through the changed-over lens (11-13), and means for
