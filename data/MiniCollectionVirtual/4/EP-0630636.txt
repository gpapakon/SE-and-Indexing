<ABSTRACT>
A low air loss patient support system (20) 
includes a plurality of identical multi-chambered 

inflatable sacks (34). A restrictive flow hole (64) 
connects two adjacent chambers (46, 54) disposed 

predominately to one side of the centerline of the sack, 
and each side is separately pressurizable under the 

control of a microprocessor (160) and a plurality of 
pressure control valves (162) with pressure transducers 

and a plurality of flow diverter valves (220) for 
switching between different modes of configuring the 

manner in which the sacks are pressurized. The system 
includes a modular manifold (128) for mounting the 

pressure control valves (162), and a modular support 
member for mounting the sacks via quick-disconnect 

couplings and having air flow channels defined 
therethrough. The support system can rotate or tilt the 

patient by depressurizing one side of the sacks (34) 
while increasing the pressurization of the opposite side 

of the sacks. An end chamber (46) of the depressurized 
side of each sack remains inflated while the adjacent 

intermediate chamber (54) becomes progressively deflated 
during depressurization to permit the end chambers to 

restrain the patient from sliding off the sacks during 
tilting. The support system can relieve pressure points 

between the patient and the sacks while elevating the 
head and chest of the patient by reconfiguring the 

diverter valves (162) to connect alternating sacks at the 
same pressure and periodically decreasing the pressure in  

 
one group of sacks while increasing the pressure in 

another group of sacks alternately to relieve the 
pressure of and on the patient between the two different 

groups of sacks depending upon which group is 
depressurizing and which group is being increased in 

pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved patient 
support systems and methods for automatically turning 
patients and for relieving pressure points. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to low air loss patient support systems and their uses. Patients confined to beds for long periods of time 
must be turned frequently to rest on different portions 
of their bodies in order to avoid the onset of bed sores 
or to alleviate discomfort associated with same. 
Turning the patient also helps avoid accumulation of 
fluid in the lungs. Heretofore, turning a patient has 
been a labor intensive task of the hospital staff, and 
the rising cost of hospital staff has made this task 
ever more expensive for the hospital and ultimately the 
patient. Though not a low air loss bed, one apparatus and 
method of turning a patient is disclosed in U.S.-A 
No. 3,485,240 to Fountain. The apparatus has cushions 
11, 12, which overlap one another substantially so that 
substantially the patient's entire body may be accommodated 
by each pad. Each cushion is normally not 
inflated when the patient rests horizontally on the bed. 
Each cushion has a surface that can be inclined when 
inflated. A mechanism 30 individually inflates and 
evacuates cushions 11, 12 and includes an outlet switch 
31, a timer 32, and a four-way valve 33. In one 
position, valve 33 connects cushion 11 to a vacuum to 
evacuate same and cushion 12 to a pump to inflate same. 
In a second position, cushion 12 is connected to the  
 
pump and cushion 11 is connected to the vacuum. The 
timer controls the sequence of alternating between the 
two positions of valve 33. Each cushion can be segmented 
to permit different segments to be inflatable to 
a different degree or contour. In order to prevent slippage of the patient on the 
inclined surface of the Fountain cushions, the patient 
is required to be confined by straps 41, 42 around the 
patient's legs for example. This constraint becomes 
useless if the patient is an amputee and is detrimental 
to the healing process if the patient has sores or 
wounds on the legs or other portions of the body that 
would be constrained by the straps. Moreover, such 
straps are uncomfortable and interfere with the ability 
of the patient to repose restfully. Furthermore, the 
inflation and evacuation mechanism 30 does not permit a 
steady state of partial evacuation of cushions 11, 12, 
requiring instead either total deflation or total 
inflation during the steady state of operation that 
occurs once inflation

A hand-detachable airtight connection (106) for 
an air sack (34) of a low air loss patient support (20), 

the patient support having an air sack supply opening (92) 
defined therein and through which air is to be supplied to 

the air sack, the air sack having an air entrance opening 
(52) defined through a wall thereof, the apparatus 

comprising: 

(a) an elongated connection fitting (108) having: 

(i) an exterior configured to engage air-tightly 
with said air sack supply opening,

disposed coupling opening (110) to receive a 

coupling in air tight engagement therewith, said
