<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a wind speed indicating apparatus.Various types of azimuth indicators for measuring
azimuth by detecting earth magnetism have been developed,
and are described in, for instance, U.S. patent No.
4,482,255. Also, anemometers capable of measuring wind
speeds are known in the field.Typically, magnetic resistance elements are employed
so as to detect earth (terrestrial) magnetism, whereas
semiconductor pressure sensors are utilized in order to
detect wind speeds.The above-described conventional azimuth indicators
and also anemometers can merely indicate azimuth and wind
speeds, respectively.From JP-A-04 093 632, it is known to provide a wristwatch with a semiconductor
pressure sensor by forming the semiconductor pressure sensor with a silicon
substrate. Such a pressure sensor is used for detecting a wind velocity.It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved wind speed display
apparatus.This is achieved by the technical teaching of claim 1. With the above-described arrangements, since the wind
speeds-measured at the respective azimuth can be displayed
in the azimuth indicating apparatus of the present
invention, any operators can readily grasp which direction,
the wind is blown along.The above-described object and other novel features of
the present invention will become more readily apparent in
the following description considered in conjunction with
the accompanying drawings, in which:
