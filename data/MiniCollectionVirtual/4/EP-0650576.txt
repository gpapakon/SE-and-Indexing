<ABSTRACT>
A camouflage material having radar screening properties is comprised of a warp-knitted fabric, so-called Raschel fabric, which includes yarn (2) into which metal fibres have been spun. The yarn is laid with a lay-out technique such that the sum of the extensions of the yarn will be generally the same in each direction in the plane of the fabric. The fabric is suitably stabilized with a sheet (1) that lacks metal fibres, which may either be a yarn layer in the warp-knitted fabric or a through-knitted fabric, preferably a nonwoven fabric coated with a reflective metal layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to camouflage material having
a radar screening effect and comprising warp-knitted fabric
in which at least part of the yarn in the fabric contains
metal fibres.US-A-3,733,606 discloses camouflage means which function
against radar reconnaissance, and also discloses a suitable
surface resistivity in this regard. It is also known in
this context to sometimes include metal wires or filaments
textile yarns, such as cut pieces of thin metal wire or
filament which are spun together with other fibres, either
natural or synthetic fibres, to form a yarn which is later
used as the warp and weft yarn in weaving processes. A good
camouflaging effect is achieved when the surface resistance
is suitably balanced, a practical standard in this regard
being 300 Ohms per square. In certain cases, however, a
lighter and more airy fabric is desired, which cannot be
achieved by weaving, therewith leaving the alternative
choice of knitted fabrics. The alternative possibility of
weaving a wider mesh is not a suitable alternative, since
the yarns will slip and slide unless glued together.
Furthermore, a woven fabric cannot be draped as well as or
will not fall as well as a knitted fabric.US-A-4,064,305 discloses knitted camouflage material. This
material, however, has been devised with the intention of
improving the wear properties and the stability properties
of the material in relation to woven fabrics with regard to
the radar defeating properties of the material when the
material is in folds or is creased. According to this
patent specification, the usable radar properties are
achieved by a stretching process followed by fixation to a
supportive sheet. An object of the present invention is to provide a lightweight
knitted fabric which can be used for camouflaging
purposes, either as it is or when leaf-cut in the manner
disclosed in the first-mentioned U.S. patent specification.
Another object of the invention is to provide a warp-knitted
fabric which exhibits from the beginning uniform
radar reflexion and transmission respectively, as far as
the polarization direction is concerned.According to one particular aspect of the invention, an
object is to provide a ready knitted fabric which exhibits
good radar properties and which is effective in the
infrared range, by "knitting together" or union knitting
with a sheet or layer that reflects in the infrared range.These objects of the invention and advantages afforded
thereby are achieved in that in a camouflage material of
the kind defined in the

<CLAIMS>
A camouflage material having a radar screening effect, comprising a warp knitted
fabric in which at least a part of the yarn contains metal fibres, wherein the yarn

containing the metal fibres is laid with a lay-out technique
such that the sum of the extensions of said yarn will be essentially the same in each

direction in the plane of the fabric,

and such that a stability against elastic stretching is obtained.
A material according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the yarn (2) containing the
metal fibres has been knitted together with a shape-stabilizing fabric layer (1).
A material according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the shape-stabilizing
fabric layer is comprised of a simultaneously produced base fabric.
A material according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the simultaneously
produced base fabric has a yarn lay-out with long float stitches.
A material according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the long float stitches are
formed by lay-outs beneath at least three needles between successive loops.
A material according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the shape-stabilizing
fabric is comprised of a sheet through-knitted with yarn containing metal fibres.
A material according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the through-knitted sheet
is coated with a light-reflecting metal layer.
A material according to any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that

the material is leaf-cut and is attached in an extended state to a supportive net in a
quilted fashion.
