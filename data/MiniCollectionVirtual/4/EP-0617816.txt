A system for identifying recipients (4) sealed by 
a tap (3) surrounded by a protective tulip (5), the 

system comprising: 

an electronic label (1) provided with an electro-magnetic 
wave emission device (8) fixed onto a ring (2) 

surrounding the tap (3) at the base of the protective 
tulip (5), the emission device comprising an electronic 

module (100) coupled with a winding (8) which provides 
the electro-magnetic link between the label (1) and a 

reading/writing head (7), the shape of the winding 
essentially conforming to that of the ring so as to 

provide a maximum surface for electro-magnetic radiation; 
a data terminal (6) connected to the moveable 
reading/writing head (7) which can be introduced as 

required into the tulip (5) directly facing the ring (2) 
supporting the label (1), to transmit data between the 

data terminal (6) and the label (1). 
System as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the ring (2) is split by a slit (9) which may have 

a closing device (10) to close the said slit (9) or the 
said ring (2). 
System as claimed in any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the winding (8) is made up of 

strand elements (8) distributed over the inner and outer 
peripheries of the ring (2) in
 such a way as to form a 
loop. 
System as claimed in one of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the electronic module (100) and the 

winding (8) are fixed to the ring (2). 
System as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that the electronic module (100) and the winding (8) are 

embedded by moulding process in the material of which the 
ring (2) is made.  

 
System as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the ring (2) is of plastics material. 
System as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the ring (2) is moveable. 
System as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the slit (9) is formed by two rabbets (11, 12) at 

the ends of the ring. 
System as claimed in claim 8, characterised in 
that the closing device (10) is a device for riveting the 

two rabbets (11, 12) of the ring. 
System as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the ring (2) is closed by clipping the two ends (11, 

12) of the ring (2). 
System as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the ring (2) has a flexible first zone (14) 

permitting bending, this zone being diametrically 
opposite the slit (9). 
System as claimed in claim 11, characterised in 
that the flexible zone (14) is formed by reducing the 

dimensions of the ring in the said zone. 
System as claimed in claim 11, characterised in 
that the flexible zone (14) is formed by a recess in the 

ring in the said zone. 
System as claimed in any one of the previous 
claims, characterised in that the ring (2) has a 

reinforced second zone (15) around the location of the 
electronic module. 
System as claimed in claim 14, characterised in 
that the second zone (15) is reinforced around the 

location of the electronic module. 
System as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the electronic module (100) is embedded in the ring 

at a location close to the slit (9) of the ring. 
System as claimed in any one of the previous 
claims, characterised in that the electronic module (100)  

 
is an integrated circuit chip.
