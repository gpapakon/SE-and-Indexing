<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus including a panel (12) formed with 
an opening (16) which includes a hole (18) defined by a 

circular peripheral edge of the panel (12) and a radial 
cutout (20) communicating with the hole (18). Received 

in the hole (18) is a cylinder lock (14) which includes 
an outer cylinder housing (22) and a key operated inner 

cylinder (24) disposed in the outer cylinder housing 
(22). A radial projection (30) extending from the outer 

cylinder housing (22) is inserted into the radial cutout 
(20). The panel (12) has an integral flap (34) partly 

defining the radial cutout (20). The integral flap (34) 
is turnable about a hinge line at which the panel (12) 

abuts against the radial projection (30) to withstand 
stress from the radial projection (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for restricting rotation of a cylinder lock including an
outer cylinder housing and a key operated inner cylinder
disposed in the outer cylinder housing, relative to a
panel of a vehicle body.Japanese Utility Model Application First
Publication No. 1-86658 discloses an apparatus for
mounting an electronic lock on a panel of a vehicle body.
The panel is formed with an opening including a hole
defined by a circular peripheral edge of the panel and a
radial cutout communicating with the hole. The
electronic lock includes a cylindrical portion and a
radial projection extending from the cylindrical portion.
The cylindrical portion is disposed within the hole with
the radial projection inserted into the radial cutout.An object of the present invention is to
provide an apparatus including a panel with an opening
and a cylinder lock disposed within the opening, which is
capable of preventing rotation of the cylinder lock
relative to the panel without any increase in thickness
of the panel or any provision of a reinforcing member.According to the present invention, there is
provided an apparatus comprising:
a panel formed with an opening including a hole
defined by a circular peripheral edge of the panel and a
radial cutout communicating with the hole; anda cylinder lock including an outer cylinder
housing, a key operated inner cylinder disposed in the
outer cylinder housing, and a radial projection extending
from the outer cylinder housing; the outer cylinder housing being disposed
within the hole with the radial projection inserted into
the radial cutout;
characterized in that the panel has an integral
flap partly defining the radial cutout, the integral flap
being turnable about a hinge line at which the panel
abuts against the radial projection to withstand stress
from the radial projection.Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of an
apparatus of a first embodiment according to the present
invention, showing a panel with an opening and a cylinder
lock;Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the apparatus
as viewed from a rear side thereof, showing the cylinder
lock received in the opening of the panel;Fig. 3 is an enlarged view in part of Fig. 2;Fig. 4 is a front elevation of the panel of
Fig. 1; andFig. 5 is an enlarged view similar to Fig. 3
but showing a modified cylinder lock.Referring now to Fig. 1, an apparatus 10
according to the present invention includes a panel 12 of
a vehicle body and a cylinder lock 14.As shown in Fig. 1, the panel 12 is formed with
an

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus comprising:

a panel (12) formed with an opening (16)
including a hole (18) defined by a circular peripheral

edge of said panel (12) and a radial cutout (20)
communicating with said hole (18);
a cylinder lock (14) including an outer
cylinder housing (22), a key operated inner cylinder (24)

disposed in said outer cylinder housing (22), and a
radial projection (30) extending from said outer cylinder

housing (22);
said outer cylinder housing (22) being disposed
within said hole (18) with said radial projection (30)

inserted into said radial cutout (20);

   
characterized in that
said panel (12) has an integral flap (34)
partly defining said radial cutout (20), said integral

flap (30) being turnable about a hinge line at which said
panel (12) abuts against said radial projection (30) to

withstand stress from said radial projection (30).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said integral flap (34) has a first
position in which said integral flap (34) has a leading

end remote from said hinge line in abutting engagement
with said radial projection (30) to withstand stress from

said radial projection (30) when said outer cylinder
housing (22) is subject to a torque having a magnitude

smaller than a predetermined value.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said integral flap (34) is forced
to turn about said hinge line by said radial projection

(30) to assume a second position when said outer cylinder
housing (22) is subject to a torque having a magnitude 

greater than said predetermined value.
