Method for producing a colour chart by partitioning 
a colour space corresponding to a determined 

collection (1 to 11, B,W) of colour components, including 
one black and one white which consists: 


in starting from a collection (1 to 11, B,W) of 
so-called "base" colour components, which collection 

covers a colour space comprising all the hues which can 
be produced by mixing the said base colour components, 

and 
in subdividing the colour space into fractions, 
each of which being assigned a reference (Ref
b
), the set 
of said fractions thus delimited and identified constituting 

the expected colour chart, 
 
characterized in that, in order to adapt the said method 

to a particular industrial application, the said method 
furthermore includes the following steps: 


the said collection is formed in such a way that 
the colour space which it covers is a space termed 

"effective" in relation to the envisaged application, 
the said effective colour space is evaluated by 
choosing a reference colour space which encompasses the 

said effective colour space, and by determining, through 
measurement of the full tones of each base colour component 

in the said collection and calculations, known per 
se, performed on the basis of these measurements, the 

trichromatic coordinates of the said base components in 
the reference colour space, 
the base colour components (1 to 11), with the 
exception of black and white, are classed in increasing  

 
order of hue angle h°, thus obtaining a set of so-called 

"standard" colour components, and each of them is positioned 
graphically according to its trichromatic 

coordinates, disregarding the luminance, joining the said 
positions to one another resulting in a number of polygons 

of various surface areas being plotted, 
a subset of components, referred to as "effective 
colour components", is selected from the said standard 

colour components by retaining only those (1, 3, 5, 6, 7,8, 
10, 11) of the said standard colour components which form 

the outer limits of the polygon having the greatest 
surface area, 
in the effective colour space, and for each of 
the pairs of effective colour components directly adjacent 

on the graphical plot (1, 3), these being referred 
to as "effective pairs", taken with black (B) and white 

(W), the limits of the so-called "effective" volume 
sector to which the said effective couple corresponds are 

determined, and 
the operation of partitioning the colour space is 
carried out by partitioning each effective volume sector 

into isoluminance planes and as a function of the working 
average Δ E of overall colour difference which is allowable 

for the industrial application in question. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the reference colour space is the CIELAB space. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the step of evaluating the effective colour space 

includes: 

measurement by spectrophotometer of the 
reflectance factor R of binary mixtures of base colour 

components (1 to 11, B,W), 
calculation of the spectral coefficients K of 
absorption and S of scattering of each component on the 

basis of the values of R thus measured by applying the 
laws of Kubelka-Munk and Saunderson, 
on the basis of these values K and S, calculation 
of the reflectance factor R of the mixtures with the same 

qualitative composition as the mixtures previously  
 

measured but in all other proportions, then 
conversion to the CIE colour space L, a, b. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, in order to determine the limits 

of the effective volume sector of each of the said 
effective pairs, taken with black and white (1, 3, B,W): 


the following are determined in the reference 
colour space: 


a point Li whose coordinates correspond to the 
black component (B), 
a point Ls whose coordinates correspond to the 
white component (W), 
a point Hi whose coordinates (L
1
, a
1
, b
1
) correspond 
to the component (1) of the two in the effective 

pair which has the smaller hue angle (h
1
) 
a point Hs whose coordinates (L
3
, a
3
, b
3
) corresponding 
to the component (3) of the two in the effective 

pair which has the larger hue angle (h
3
), and 
the loci 
Ls,Li
, 
Ls,Hs
, 
Ls,Hi
, 
Hs,Hi
, 
Li,Hi
, and 

Li,Hs
, which limit the said effective volume sector are 

determined. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that each of the loci is determined by calculation on the 

basis of the K and S value of the said effective pairs, 
of black and of white (1, 3, B,W). 
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the effective volume space is partitioned in 

three steps: 

partitioning into isoluminance planes using a 
number of planes equal to the value of the difference (L
W
 
- L
B
) in luminance between white and black, divided by 
the average overall colour difference (Δ E) allowable for 

the application in question, 
on each of the said planes, determination of the 
limits of the effective colour space by calculation and 

juxtaposition of the loci of the mixtures of effective 
colour components brought to isoluminance hy mixing the 

components of each effective pair with black or with 
white, depending on whether the luminance of the plane is  

 
less than or greater than the luminance of the said pair 

in the proportions in question, and 
partitioning by isosaturation by plotting concentric 
circles (C
1
, C
2
, C
3
, etc.) on each isoluminance plane 
with a spacing equal to the average overall colour 

difference (Δ E) allowable for the application in question, 
then by determining as many ring sectors as the 

complete rings (A
9
, A
10
, etc.) or ring portions (A
1
, A
2
, 
etc.) thus obtained contain angle sectors of value 

2.δh°, such that 

δh° = arctan (ΔE/2) / [C
2
 - ΔE

/4]
½
 
where 


h° is the hue angle 
ΔE is the average of overall colour difference 
allowable for the application in question 
C is the average of the radii of the circles (C
1
, 
C
3
), expressed in CIELab units. 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the referencing of each volume section fraction, 

that is to say of each hue of the colour chart, indicates 
the luminance values L and the values C and h° of the 

said hue. 
Method according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that, on the one hand, a theoretical spectral reemission 

curve obtained by reflectance synthesis calculation 
of a mixture whose qualitative composition is 

defined by the volume section fraction of the colour 
chart to which the hue belongs and, on the other hand, 

the quantitative composition of the latter, correspond to 
each hue reference. 
Use of the colour chart obtained directly by the 
method according to any one of Claims 3 to 8, for reducing 

the inter-instrument error between: 

the so-called "base" spectrophotometer employed 
for producing the said colour chart, and 
a different make of spectrophotometer, referred 
to as the "new spectrophotometer", 
 
characterized in that it includes the following steps:  

 

the reflectance spectral factor R'(λ) of the 
mixtures which have been used for calculating the spectral 

coefficients K(λ) and S(λ) of each base component in 
the collection used to produce the colour chart is 

measured with the new spectrophotometer, 
on the basis of the said reflectance spectral 
factors R'(λ), the values specific to the new 

spectrophotometer of the spectral coefficients K'(λ) and 
S'(λ) of each base component are recalculated in a manner 

known per se, 
the reflectance spectral factors R'(λ) of each 
reference of the colour chart, referred to as "base 

reference" (Ref
b
), are recalculated by reflectance synthesis 
on the basis of the qualitative and quantitative 

composition associated with each reference, 
new referencing (Ref
n
) is carried out by calculating 
the values L, C and h° on the basis of the 

reflectance spectral factors R'(λ) of each reference, 
a correspondence is established between each base 
reference (Ref
b
) and the reference (Ref
n
) obtained with 
the new spectrophotometer, 
each reflectance spectral factor measurement 
R' (X) taken with the new spectrophotometer is paired with 

a reference (Ref
n
) of the new referencing, and 
equivalence between the new referencing (Ref
n
) 
and the base referencing (Ref
b
) is sought.
