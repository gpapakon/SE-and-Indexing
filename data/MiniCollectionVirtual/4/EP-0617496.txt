<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an electrified wall panel 
system having a power distribution server locatable 

within a wall panel unit. The power distribution 
server has four receptacle module ports oriented in an 

H-shaped configuration in which a first receptacle port 
on a first side of the wall panel unit opens toward a 

first end of the wall panel unit, a second receptacle 
port on the first side of the wall panel unit opens 

toward a second end of the wall panel unit, a third 
receptacle port on a second side of the wall panel unit 

opens toward the first end of the wall panel unit, and 
fourth receptacle port on the second side of the wall 

panel unit opens toward the second end of the wall 
panel unit. First and second harnesses are each 

electrically connected at first ends thereof to the 
power distribution server, extend to opposite ends of 

the wall panel unit, and include connector ports on the 
second ends thereof for providing electrical 

interconnection of adjacent wall panel units. There is 
also disclosed an electrified wall panel system with 

wall panel connector interchangeably usable with the 
interconnection of two, three, and four wall panel 

units. The connector includes a hook member for 
connecting together adjacent vertical members of frames 

of adjacent wall panel units at a lower portion thereof 
and a draw nut for connecting together adjacent 

vertical members of frames of adjacent wall panel units 
at an upper portion thereof by vertical displacement 

thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to wall 
panel systems. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to electrified wall panel systems. Wall panel systems are used extensively in 
commercial and industrial settings to define workspace, 
provide privacy, control traffic flow, and minimize 
noise. Wall panel systems can also provide suitable 
structures for use with desks, tables, shelves, trays 
and the like as well as with other furniture, 
components, equipment and material such as may be used 
in a commercial or industrial setting. In addition, 
wall panel systems can be advantageously integrated 
into the design and decoration of a commercial or industrial 
setting. Wall panel systems may be comprised of individual 
wall panel units of various types and sizes. 
Wall panel units may be full height floor-to-ceiling 
walls or may be walls of less than floor-to ceiling 
height, or may be comprised of a combination of such 
walls of varying heights. Wall panel units may totally 
enclose or only partially enclose specific areas depending  
 
upon the particular needs of the site. An advantage 
of wall panel systems of this type is that they 
can be reconfigured relatively easily compared to 
permanent wall structures (such as studs and drywall, 
plaster, or concrete). In using wall panel systems, it is essential 
to provide electricity to workstations located in and 
around the wall panel units. Present demands for electrical 
power consumption may require the provision of 
several circuits through a wall panel system. Present 
demands may even require the use of one or more 
isolated circuits that do not share a neutral or ground 
wire with other circuits in order to minimize 
electrical interference that might cause problems for 
computer or communication systems. Accordingly, it is 
desirable that an electric distribution system be 
provided with the wall panel system that is easy to 
install yet provides a high level of electrical 
service. Related to the feature of ease of installation 
is reconfigurability. Wall panel systems may be 
preferred over permanent wall structures because of the 
relative ease with which such systems can be reconfigured 
to adapt to the needs of a changing or expanding 
business. In particular, where a wall panel system 
is of high quality and durable, it is possible that at 
some point during the use of the wall panel system, the 
user's need will change and a reconfiguration of the 
wall panel system will be desired. In such a case, it 
would be advantageous to have

<CLAIMS>
An electrified wall panel system 
comprising: 

   at least two wall panel units; 
   a wall panel unit connector including means 

for releasably connecting adjacent ends of said two 
wall panel units, said wall panel unit connector 

further including a vertical skeletal post within said 
wall panel unit connector and housing means spaced 

apart from said skeletal post; 
   power distribution means within each of said 

two wall panel units each including a harness which 
extends to the end of the wall panel unit; and 

   inter-panel electrical connector with at 
least a first and second connector port matable with 

harness end connector ports for electrically connecting 
the harnesses of the two wall panel units, said inter--panel 

electrical connector comprising attaching means 
for releasable attachment to the skeletal post, whereby 

said inter-panel electrical connector can be attached 
within said housing means and at various heights along 

the skeletal post. 
The electrified wall panel system of 
Claim 1 in which the two connector ports of said 

inter-panel electrical connector are oriented so that 
the first connector port is oriented 180 degrees away 

from the second connector port to thereby enable 
electrical connection between wall panel units joined 

end to end longitudinally. 
The electrified wall panel system of 
Claim 1 in which the two connector ports of said 

inter-panel electrical connector means are oriented so 
that the first port is oriented 90 degrees away from 

the second connector port to thereby enable electrical 
connection between wall panel units joined at a right 

angle. 
The electrified wall panel system of 
Claim 1 wherein the inter-panel electrical connector 

further comprises a third connector port and wherein 
the first connector port is oriented 180 degrees away 

from the second connector port and the third connector 
port is oriented 90 degrees away from the second 

connector port to thereby enable electrical connection 
between three wall panel units joined in a T 

configuration. 
The electrified wall panel system of 
Claim 1 wherein the inter-panel electrical connector 

further comprises a third and fourth connector port and 
wherein the first connector port is oriented 180 

degrees away from the second connector port, the third 
connector port is oriented 90 degrees away from the 

second connector port, and the fourth connector port is 
oriented 180 degrees away from the third connector port 

to thereby enable electrical connection between four 
wall panel units joined in an X configuration.
