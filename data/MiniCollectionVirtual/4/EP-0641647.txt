<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminate film or
sheet which is excellent in drop impact strength, heat
sealability, hygienic qualities and flexibility.Conventionally non-rigid polyvinyl chloride films have
been widely used because of their transparency, mechanical
strength and flexibility in the fields of food packaging,
medical instruments, industrial materials, etc. Films of
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, ultra-low density
polyethylenes and the like have been used for various
purposes for their flexibility, transparency, hygienic
qualities, etc.However, non-rigid polyvinyl chloride films used for
medical instruments and the like have posed hygienic
problems due to a large amount of plasticizers present
therein. Further, there has been a demand in this and other
countries for materials usable in place of non-rigid
polyvinyl chloride films since the films erode the furnace
in calcining waste films for disposal. Such films need a
large thickness to make up for the low drop impact strength
of the films, and thus the transparency of the films is
inevitably adversely affected. Typical non-rigid films
analogous to the non-rigid polyvinyl chloride films include
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, ultra-low density
polyethylenes, etc. These non-rigid films have a problem.
Since the non-rigid films of large thickness are poor in 
transparency, gloss and the like, those of small thickness
are inevitably used although unsatisfactory in drop impact
strength, etc. A further problem is that these films are
difficult to use as heat-resistant materials for bags for
preserving blood platelets, etc. which require heat
resistance.Improvements over such films have been proposed in
JP-A-77,371/1993 which
discloses a three-layer laminate film comprising an
intermediate layer of an amorphous polyolefin or a mixture
of said amorphous polyolefin and a crystalline polypropylene
in a specific ratio and two outer layers of crystalline
polypropylene. It is known that such three-layer films are
suitably usable as packaging films, films for medical applications,
etc. Yet, due to their low drop impact strength,
the films have a problem. When used as packaging materials
for liquids or heavy contents or for medical containers such
as bags for containing parenteral solutions or for blood or
bags for preserving blood platelets, etc, the films may
become cracked or fractured and will leak during transport.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
novel laminate film free of the foregoing prior art
problems.It is another
