<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a retaining device for sliding doors, folding/sliding doors, sliding windows or the like which can be displaced along a running rail. The retaining device is composed of a carrying part (3), guided on the running rail, and of a connecting part (4) which can be fixed on a displaceable leaf/sash and has a bolt (5), projecting into a locking device (6) of the carrying part (3), with a head (7). According to the invention, the locking device (6) is composed of at least one two-armed latching lever (8) which is swivellably mounted on the carrying part (3) and, by means of one of its ends, rests on the bolt (5) and, in the region of its other end, is acted upon by a spring (11), that end of the latching lever which rests on the bolt (5) being located above the pivot bearing of the latching lever (8). This design permits easy connection of carrying part (3) and connecting part (4), and the abovementioned parts can also be rapidly separated from one another again.

A guide rail system for sliding doors, sliding and folding 
doors, sliding windows or the like, which are displaceable along a guide 

rail (1), having a guide rail and a holding device, which holding device 
comprises a carrier portion (3) guided at the guide rail side, and a 

connecting portion (4) which can be fixed to a displaceable leaf member 
(2) and which has a pin (5) projecting into a locking device (6) of the 

carrier portion (3), wherein at its end which is in the region of the 
locking device (6) the pin is provided with a head (7) behind which the 

locking device (6) engages, and the locking device (6) has at least one 
two-armed retaining lever (8) which is mounted pivotably on the carrier 

portion (3) and which bears with one of its ends against the pin (5), 
characterised in that in the region of its other end the retaining lever 

is acted upon by a spring (11), wherein the end of the retaining lever (8) 
which bears against the pin (5) is above the pivot mounting of the 

retaining lever (8) so that in the event of loading of the pin (5) 
downwardly wedging of the retaining lever (8) relative to the pin (5) 

occurs. 
A guide rail system according to claim 1 characterised in that 
there are provided two retaining levers (8) which are disposed in mutually 

opposite relationship. 
A guide rail system according to claim 1 or claim 2 

characterised in that the carrier portion (3) is provided with one or more 
rollers (10) and the retaining lever or levers are mounted on the spindles 

(9) of the rollers (10). 
A guide rail system according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the pin (5) is in the form of a heightadjusting 

screw.  
 
A guide rail system according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the width of the retaining lever (8) or the 

retaining levers (8) is less than the width of the carrier portion (3). 
A guide rail system according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the retaining lever (8) or the retaining 

levers (8) is or are of an integral configuration in the form of a shaped 
sheet metal portion or portions respectively.
