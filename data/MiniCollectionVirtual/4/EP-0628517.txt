<CLAIMS>
Biological clarifying apparatus for clarifying 
waste water, more especially domestic waste water, 

comprising at least one pre-clarifying tank and one 
post-clarifying tank, as well as a subsequent pump shaft 

having a pumping means for the partial return and for the 
delivery of the clarified water, characterised in that a 

single return line (15) is provided from the pump shaft (3) 
to the (first) pre-clarifying tank (1) and communicates 

with the pressure line (14) of a single pump (13), and in 
that this pressure line (14) includes a control valve (17), 

one outlet of which is connected to the return line (15) 
and the other outlet of which is connected to a discharge 

line (16). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the control valve (17) is connected to a timer. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the control valve (17) is connected to a control means 

(18), which responds to physical and/or chemical values of 
the purified water. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the pumping means (12) and/or any 

warning means (19) which may be provided are connected to a 
level sensor (19) disposed in the pump shaft (3).
