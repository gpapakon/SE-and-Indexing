Apparatus for producing hollow bodies through 
deformation of a pipe by the internal high-pressure 

method, comprising a plurality of forming rams (3) 
which are each mounted at the free axially movable 

end of an associated hydraulic cylinder piston 
arrangement (4), at least one of said forming rams 

(3) being equipped with a pressurized fluid supply 
means, 
characterized in that
 
said forming rams (3) are adjustable relative to 

each other in space with regard to their operating 
axis and point of attack. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the hydraulic cylinder 
piston arrangements (4) are pivotably supported by 

articulated joint heads (5), that said articulated 
joint heads (5) are adjustable in mutually parallel 

longitudinal guide means (6), and that said longitudinal 
guide means (6) are arranged on an annular 

guide means (7) which is located in a position 
orthogonal to said longitudinal guide means (6) so 

that the latter are pivotable about the central 
axis (8) of said annular guide means. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized 
in that
 said articulated joint 
heads (5) take the form of ball joint heads.  

 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 2 or 3, 

characterized in that
 said 
longitudinal guide means(6) take the form of pocket 

detent guideways. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 2 through 4, 

characterized in that
 said 
hydraulic cylinder piston arrangements (4), said 

joint heads (5), and said longitudinal guide means 
(4) are each adjustable independently of one 

another.
