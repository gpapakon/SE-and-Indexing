<ABSTRACT>
This is a kind of mandrel for processing workpiece with internal 
spline. Its technical characteristics are that two half-keys 

separated by a lever are installed in lower grooves of a cylindrical 
and elastic clack clip (8). The lever (10) has a conical head in the 

lower 
end within the cylinder, and an expanding sleeve (9), a spring (7), steel 

bells (6), a sleeve (5), steel balls (4), an upper sleeve (3), steel 
balls (2) and a 

nut (1) are assembled in order. This new and practical mandrel is 
used in processing workpiece with internal spline in high precision 

and efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to parts of machine tools, especially to 
a mandrel for processing workpieces with internal spline. The general technology, such as disclosed in Chinese patent 
application 88 216 959.1, uses a mandrel which is fixed to a 
rotary working table by a lower conical handle to clamp the 
workpiece by means of an elastic clack clip. However, this 
device cannot reach high positioning precision, because only 
the upper section of a clack clip contacts with the workpiece. 
Also it is a troublesome pre-positioning work with low 
efficiency to fix the lower section by a conical handle 
without a positioning unit. The document US-A 2,960,342, which corresponds to the pre-characterizing 
part of claim 1, discloses a device for holding a 
gear blank in the manufacture of precision gears with 
expandable spline. The gear blank has spline teeth broached in 
the bore thereof, and the expandable spline comprises a hub, 
teeth on the outer periphery of said hub mating with the 
spline teeth in the gear blank, a plurality of alternate slots 
in said hub extending from each end approximately two-thirds 
the length of said hub, a tapered arbor received in said 
bore, a pin extending from said arbor engaged in a slot in 
said hub, and nuts on the respective ends of said arbor of 
expanding said hub and locking said gear, spline hub and arbor 
in fixed relation to each other whereby all faces of said gear 
are exposed for machining.  
 The mandrel according to the invention has been engineered for 
processing a workpiece with an internal spline to position it 
with high precision and efficiency. To achieve this, two half-keys 
separated by a lever are installed in a lower groove of 
a cylindrical and elastic clack clip. Said lever has a 
conical head at its lower end within the cylinder, and an 
expanding sleeve, a spring, first steel balls, a second 
sleeve, second steel balls, an upper sleeve, and third 
stellballs and a nut are assemblied in order. At least one 
passing groove exist between two keys in the spline of said 
cylindrical and elastic clack clip. A detailed explanation will be given in connection with the 
drawing, wherein 
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a preferred embodiment of a 
mandrel according to the invention; Figure 2 is a view in direction of the arrow "A" of figure 1; Figure 3 is a vertical view to the mandrel of figure 1; Figure 4 is an outline drawing of the mandrel of figure 1; and Figure 5 is a section taken on line B-B of figure 3. Referring to figures 1 to 5, two half-keys
