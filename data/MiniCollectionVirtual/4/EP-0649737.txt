<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multilayer
laminate in which sheets or films based on polyolefin
are laminated and more specifically to a polyolefin
multilayer laminate adapted for a forming material for
packing and the use thereof.As packing material for packaging articles of
daily use, household goods, foods, drug tablets and so
on, many functional properties are required, for
example, transparency, moistureproof property, heat-sealability,
vacuum or pneumatic formability and hand-shapability.
Thus, such a variety of requirements are
not sufficiently satisfied with one single resin, so
that there have widely been used multilayer laminates
which are made by laminating a sheet or film of one
resin with a sheet or film of another resin.On the other hand, there is a general trend
that favor is given for polyolefin resins as the film
material in view of recycling of material or problems
on the incineration. While cycloolefin resins are
superior in the transparency, moistureproof property, 
vacuum or pneumatic formability, dead-hold property and
so on, they are subject to a sudden softening at around
the glass transition temperature, since they are
non-crystalline resin, resulting in a decrease in the
modulus of elasticity, strength and so on. For this
reason, there is a problem that the permissible range
in chosing the conditions for heat-sealing, inflation
molding and vacuum or penumatic forming is narrow and,
for certain applications, the flexibility of the
resulting film is too low.EP-A-0 570 188 being state of the art in the sense of
Art. 54(3) EPC relates to a sheet or film for PTP or blister
package having excellent moisture resistance and transparency
and readily prepared by vacuum or pneumatic forming which comprises
a layer made of at least one non-crystalline polyolefin resin
selected from
(A-a) a cycloolefin random copolymer which is made from
ethylene and a cycloolefin having a specified general formula
and has an intrinsic viscosity [η] of 0.01-10 dl/g determined
in decalin at 135°C and a softening temperature (TMA) of 50-200°C,(A-b) a (co)polymer, obtained by a ring-opening
polymerization of the cycloolefin or a hydrogenation product
thereof, which has an intrinsic viscosity [η] of 0.01-10 dl/g
determined in decalin at 135°C and a softening temperature
(TMA) of 50-200°C, and(A-c) a graft-modified product of said cycloolefin random
copolymer (A-a) or said ring-opening (co)polymer or its
hydrogenation product (A-b).The non-cristalline polyolefin resin (A) may be laminated
with a cristalline
