<ABSTRACT>
Anodized aluminum coatings employed in semiconductor 
processing equipment are treated to reduce their 

sensitivity to halogenated species. The pores of the 
aluminum oxide surface can be filled either by a metal, 

such as magnesium or aluminum, forming the corresponding 
metal oxide that is resistant to reaction with halogens, or 

by filling the pores with a getter for halogens, such as 
hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions adsorbed on the surface of 

the aluminum oxide react with halogens to form volatile 
hydrogen halides that can be pumped away in the exhaust 

system of the semiconductor processing chambers, thereby 
preventing or reducing reaction of the underlying aluminum 

oxide with the halogens.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved anodization processes 
and anodized aluminum coatings. More particularly, this invention 
relates to treated anodized aluminum coatings useful in harsh 
environments and processes for making the same. Aluminum metal is used in the semiconductor industry far 
parts and liners for various processing chambers including 
chemical vapor deposition and etch chambers. For example, 
substrate supports, susceptors, chamber walls and the like are 
made of aluminum metal. The aluminum becomes oxidized in air to 
form a thin native aluminum oxide coating thereon which is 
impervious to some of the chemical species generated in such 
chambers during standard processing. However, chemicals such as 
halides, e.g., bromides, chlorides and fluorides, are employed as 
etch and deposition gases, for example, and some of these 
processes are carried out in plasmas and/or at elevated 
temperatures. These chemicals will also etch or otherwise degrade 
aluminum and eventually the relatively thin native oxide 
coatings. Thus a thicker protective coating of aluminum oxide is 
desired. Aluminum oxide coatings thicker than native oxide coatings 
can be made by anodizing the aluminum. Anodization can be carried 
out by making aluminum the anode and forming a suitable 
electrolyte in an electrolytic cell. Suitable electrolytes  
 
include inorganic acids such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid; or 
organic acids such as acetic acid or oxalic acid, for example. A 
DC voltage of 15-45 volts is applied until an aluminum oxide 
coating layer of the desired thickness over the aluminum metal is 
obtained, suitably about 0.0127 - 0.0508 mm (0.5 - 2 mils) thick. Fig. 1A is a photomicrograph (110x) of the top surface of a 
grit blasted anodized aluminum surface that was anodized using 
oxalic acid. The aluminum oxide surface is quite uniform. Fig. 1B is a photomicrograph (30,000x) of a cross section 
of an oxalic acid treated aluminum surface illustrating the 
somewhat porous, columnar structure of the aluminum oxide 
surface. Anodized aluminum is employed to protect aluminum parts 
from harsh etch environments. However, as shown in Fig. 1B, 
anodized aluminum is somewhat porous, and eventually the anodized 
coating is also attacked by harsh chemical species, particularly 
halogens, thereby exposing and etching away the underlying 
aluminum metal. Fig. 2A is a photomicrograph (110x) of an oxalic acid 
anodized aluminum surface that has been exposed to a CF₄/N₂O 
plasma at about 420°C for about 150 hours. It
