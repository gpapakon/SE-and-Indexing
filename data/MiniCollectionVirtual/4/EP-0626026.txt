<DESCRIPTION>
 A TOILET CAGE DISPENSER The present invention relates to cages for dispensing disinfectant into toilet bowls and, in particular, to a dispensing cage in which it is simple to install refill tablets. BACKGROUND ARTThe use of dispensing cages for dispensing disinfectants into toilet bowls has become prevalent in recent times. The usual type of dispensing cage comprises a body having a number of holes therein in which a disinfectant tablet is placed. The cage includes a elongate clip which fits over the rim of a toilet bowl with the cage located underneath the rim inside the bowl. When the cistern is operated, some of the water entering the toilet bowl washes through the cage and hence some disinfectant goes into solution. The disinfectant is usually coloured, for example blue, which provides the user with an indication that the tablet is still working effectively, as well as for the psychological reasons where it is common to equate blue toilet water with clean toilet water.Existing dispensing cages are able to be used continuously by replacing the tablet within the cage when the tablet is completely dissolved. It is possible to purchase replacement tablets to insert into the empty or near empty cages. However, it has been found that all users of dispensing cages do not use the replacement tablets as it is necessary to remove the dispensing cage from the toilet bowl in order that the replacement tablets can be inserted. It has been found that some the of users of such cages are reluctant to remove the dispensing cage from the toilet bowl as it is a slightly unpleasant procedure to perform. There is also concern in the interest of hygiene.Therefore, the most common way of dispensing of the dispensing cage is to dislodge it off the rim of the toilet bowl and allow it to be flushed down the toilet into the sewer. This is not a desirable procedure as the plastics dispensing cages clog up the sewerage system and have to be filtered out with other solids. The dispensing cages are an unwanted throwaway in the sewerage systems.OBJECT OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide an improved dispensing cage which substantially overcomes or ameliorates the above mentioned disadvantages. 

 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a dispensing cage comprising a body and a locating strap, said body having a plurality of apertures to allow water to pass therethrough and said locating strap being positionable about a rim of a toilet bowl,
