<ABSTRACT>
A prepreg consisting of the following constituent elements: (A), (B) and (C), and the constituent element (C) 
is distributed in the portion of the prepreg which is close to a superficial layer of one or both surfaces thereof, the 

constituent element (C) not having regular arrangement (A) reinforced fibers consisting of long fibers; (B) matrix resin; 
(C) long fibers of a thermoplastic resin. The prepreg according to the present invention gives a composite material 

retaining its tacking characteristics and draping characteristics and its thermal resistance when it is hot formed, and 
having excellent impact resistance and inter-layer tenacity. This prepreg is manufactured easily, and has a high degree 

of freedom as a material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to prepregs used for preparing fiber
reinforced plastics excellent in strength, elastic modulus, impact
resistance and inter-layer toughness.Fiber reinforced plastics as a kind of composite material are
anisotropic materials with reinforcing fibers and a matrix resin as
the essential components and their physical properties in the fiber
direction are greatly different from those in the other directions.
In general, the strength and elastic modulus in the fiber
direction are very high but those in the other directions are low.
As a widely adopted method for producing a fiber reinforced plastic
material, layers of a filmy precursor called a prepreg formed by
impregnating reinforcing fibers with an uncured thermosetting resin
are laminated, formed and cured to obtain the intended product.
Hereinafter unless otherwise stated, the term "composite material"
means a fiber reinforced plastic material obtained by laminating
layers of a prepreg, and forming and hardening the laminate.
When a composite material is obtained from a prepreg, a fabric
obtained by weaving reinforcing fibers is used in the prepreg, or
layers of a prepreg made of reinforcing fibers arranged
unidirectionally are laminated with the reinforcing fiber
directions crossed, for rendering the physical properties almost
isotropic in the obtained product.However, it is known that even if these techniques are adopted, the
impact resistance and other properties of the composite material
are not fundamentally improved by enhancement of the strength of
the reinforcing fibers, since they are affected by inter-layer 
fracture. The inter-layer region of the composite material is that
region in the vicinity of the interface between laminated layers of
a prepreg. This region has a low content of reinforcing fibers,
and since the reinforcing fibers are differently oriented on both
sides of the interface, fracture is liable to occur in the region.
Especially a composite material with a thermosetting resin as the
matrix resin is insufficient in impact resistance since the matrix
resin is low in toughness. Furthermore, if a tensile load is
applied onto a crossed laminate, inter-layer peeling often occurs
at an end of the laminate, so the latitude in laminate composition
is often limited. Various methods are proposed for the purpose of
improving the physical properties in the directions other than the
fiber direction, especially impact resistance and inter-layer
toughness, and many techniques are proposed which use, at the
