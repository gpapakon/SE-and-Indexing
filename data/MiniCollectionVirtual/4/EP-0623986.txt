<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to battery charging, and
particularly to a battery charger which can be used with
either nickel cadmium (NICD) batteries or nickel metal hydride
(NIMH) batteries.Through the proliferation of portable equipment and
appliances, the demand for rechargeable batteries is rising by
the day. This has brought about innovations and improvement
in rechargeable battery design. The most commonly used
secondary battery used in portable applications is the Nickel
Cadmium (NICD) battery.Although newer NICD batteries offer higher energy densities,
the demand for more power and longer operation time is
outstripping the pace of its progress. There is also an
increasing concern about contamination of the environment
during disposal of spent NICD cells due to the toxic nature of
its Cadmium content. These created a pressing need for a new
kind of battery to replace the NICD cell. This battery should
have a higher energy storage density than the best NICD
designs but should not possess any harmful content in its
composition that can hurt the environment during disposal
(i.e. easily disposable).The new Nickel Metal Hydride (NIMH) battery provides a viable
alternative to its NICD counterpart as it meets the two
above-mentioned requirements. Average capacity improvement of
the NIMH cell over the high performance NICD cell is around
30%. Also, since it does not contain any heavy metal in its
composition, it has minimal impact on the environment and thus
is easily disposable.Thus, there is now a demand for a battery charger which can
charge both NICD and NIMH battery cells. A difficulty arises
in that these batteries have different charging
characteristics. When charging a NICD or NIMH battery, the voltage and cell
temperature characteristics take the form as illustrated in
Figures 5 and 6. As illustrated in Figure 5, the battery
voltage increases slowly for 90% of the battery capacity
during charging, but starts to climb steeply after that from
point P1 in Figure 5. The voltage then levels off at point P3
and, for a NICD battery, then starts to decline from point P3
to point P4. This is shown by curve b in Figure 5. However,
for a NIMH battery, the voltage tends to flatten out, from
points P3 to P5 in curve a of Figure 5.Figure 6 illustrates the temperature curve. The temperature
increases gradually for 90% of the capacity (with a steeper
increase for the NIMH battery) and increases more steeply near
to the point of full charge, points P6 to P7 in curve c
representing a NICD battery and points P8
