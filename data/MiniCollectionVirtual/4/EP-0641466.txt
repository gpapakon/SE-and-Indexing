<DESCRIPTION>
 ASYNCHRONOUS TEMPORAL NEURAL PROCESSING ELEMENT\ Λ GOVERNMENT RIGHTSThe U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to processing elements in electronic neural net¬ works and to data processing systems generatable by combinations of such pro¬ cessing elements. In particular, the present invention relates to asynchronous temporal processing elements which simulate neuron electrophysiology at sub- cellular levels. The present invention is useful in solving a wide range of temporal signal processing problems.Artificial Neural NetworksArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) axe computational mechanisms that are structured and act in a manner that is analogous to biological neurons, as is shown in Fig. 1. In its simplest form, an ANN consists of a number of Pro¬ cessing Elements (PEs) interconnected via weighted connections. In ANNs, the processing elements axe typically called "neurons" and the connections axe called "synapses". The signal lines from the neurons to synapses a e called "axons", and those fro the synapses to the neurons axe called "dendrites". These ele¬ ments axe called the "Standard Components" of the neural system. Each neuron is impinged upon by numerous synapses, which caxry current from neighboring 

neurons. The input currents are integrated by the capacitance of the neuron in what is called the "post synaptic potential" (PSP) until a critical threshold is reached, at which point an "action potential" (AP) is generated. In biological- systems, the PSP is a continuous in time, continuous in amplitude signal, and the AP is a continuous in time, discrete in amplitude signal. The action po¬ tential is propagated down the axon to a synapse connecting the neuron with another neuron.Although these elements can be quite simple, the large amount of them re¬ quired to perform practical tasks makes their implementation complicated. The most common PE, in which incoming signals axe summed and then convolved with a sigmoϊdal transfer function, embodies two basic assumptions. First, it is assumed that communication between neurons can be approximated by a slowly-varying scalar value, which is typically interpreted as the frequency of APs. Second, it is assumed that computation within neurons occurs instanta¬ neously — i.e., that there is no delay between the arrival of an incoming signal and its effect on the output. While these
