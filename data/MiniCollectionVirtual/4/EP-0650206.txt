<ABSTRACT>
Provided is an oxide superconducting conductor 
consisting of a plurality of metal-covered 

multifilamentary superconducting wires which are assembled 
with each other. Bending is applied to the 

superconducting conductor for improving its critical 
current density. It is possible to obtain a compact 

superconducting conductor having higher capacity, since 
its critical current density is increased by such 

application of bending.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide
superconducting conductor, and more particularly, it
relates to an oxide superconducting conductor having a
high critical current density.In recent years, ceramic superconducting materials,
i.e., oxide superconducting materials, exhibiting higher
critical temperatures are watched with interest. In
particular, yttrium, bismuth and thallium oxide
superconducting materials exhibit high critical
temperatures of about 90 K, 110 K and 120 K respectively,
to remain in superconducting states under temperatures
higher than the liquid nitrogen temperature. Thus, such
oxide superconducting materials are expected for practical
application to high temperature superconducting materials
with cooling media of liquid nitrogen.In relation to practical use of such an oxide
superconducting material, study is now being made on
application to a superconducting cable which is cooled
with liquid nitrogen, for example. When a superconducting
cable consisting of an oxide superconducting material is 
put into practice, it is possible to simplify a thermal
protection system and to reduce the cooling cost since
this cable requires no cooling with high-priced liquid
helium, dissimilarly to a conventional superconducting
cable utilizing a metal superconducting conductor.The inventors have satisfied in development of an
oxide superconducting wire which is excellent in
bendability by bringing a superconductor into a
multifilamentary state with silver, for example, as an
exemplary oxide superconducting conductor which is applied
to such a superconducting cable. They have discovered
that it is possible to obtain a flexible oxide
superconducting conductor having a high critical current
density by assembling a plurality of such silver-covered
superconducting multifilamentary wires on a flexible pipe
which serves as a core called a former as mentioned in "Advances in Superconductivity" by Y. Bando and H. Yamanchi, Springer-Verlag Tokyo, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 1993, in the chapter, 5 m/2kA High-Tc Cable Conductor" on page 1251.In an oxide superconducting conductor obtained in the
aforementioned manner, however, there still remains a room
to be improved in view of the critical current density.
An oxide superconducting conductor which is applied to a
cable or the like must have a higher critical current
density. The EP-A-0 504 895 discloses a tape-type
superconducting wire which is provided by applying
compression work to a wire manufactured by drawing and
discloses a superconducting wire which
