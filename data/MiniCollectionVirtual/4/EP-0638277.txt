<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning glove/mitten (1), especially for 
glass, is made from a composite of at least three 

layers of material. The outer layer, preferably of 
non-woven material, such as viscose, allows dirt and 

moisture to penetrate through it. Inside the outer 
layer is an absorbent layer or layers. This can be a 

core layer of cellulosic material, or two or more 
layers of paper. An inner, protective layer, for 

example of non-woven material, may also be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gloves/mittens for 
cleaning purposes, especially for the cleaning of 
glass, such as windows, etc. Various gloves/mittens have been devised for 
cleaning purposes, made from a variety of materials, 
for example for use in hospitals for the hygienic 
cleaning of patients. One such example is described in 
EP-A-0409802. The cleaning glove/mitten in accordance with 
the present invention is particularly, but not 
exclusively, intended for the purpose of cleaning glass 
surfaces to remove dirt and/or moisture. One 
particular application of this is to the cleaning of 
car windows. In accordance with the present invention 
there is provided a cleaning glove/mitten, which is 
made from a composite of at least three layers of 
material, of which an outer layer is of a material 
through which dirt and moisture can pass, and of which 
at least the layer next to the outer layer is of a 
material which will absorb dirt and moisture passing 
through the outer layer. In one embodiment, there is a layer of 
material on the inside of the glove/mitten to prevent 
the dirt and moisture penetrating to the hand. In another embodiment, there are at least two 
layers of paper on the inside of the outer layer. Preferably, the outer layer of material is a 
non-woven material. This non-woven material may be for 
example 100% viscose or a blend of polypropylene and 
viscose, possibly incorporating polyester. The glove/mitten may also be provided with an 
attached or attachable pad, for example impregnated  
 
with a cleaning material which can first be wiped upon 
the glass before using the glove or mitten to perform 
the cleaning operation. In order that the invention may be fully 
understood, a number of presently preferred embodiments 
of glove/mitten in accordance with the invention will 
now be described by way of example and with reference 
to the accompanying drawing. In the drawing: 
Fig. 1 is a representation of a glove/mitten; Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the 
line II-II in Fig. 1; and, Fig. 3 is a sectional view through an 
alternative composite material of which a glove/mitten 
may be made. Fig. 1 of the drawings shows a glove or 
mitten 1 formed simply from a folded composite or 
alternatively from two layers of the composite 
stitched, sealed or otherwise secured along the edges. As shown in Fig. 2 the composite comprises an 
inner layer 10 which is in contact with the hand and 
which is preferably of a non-woven material. This 
inner layer 10 should provide stability to the 
gl
