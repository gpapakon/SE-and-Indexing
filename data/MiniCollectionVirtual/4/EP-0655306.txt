<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention are the moulding machines, 
particularly the inner part (core pin) of such moulding machines 

for manufacturing of thermoplastic preforms, which are later on 
stretch-blown to containers such as
 PET-bottles. The invention 
relates to preforms having a multi-layer structure and 

incorporating a recycled inner layer, embedded into two layers 
of virgin material being on the outside and the inside of said 

preform. The core pin is designed by the invention such that the 
inner layer of the preform has a minimum thickness at their 

bottom area and that the minimum thickness is considerably 
larger than that in a layer known from prior art. The increase 

of layer-thickness is achieved by designing the core (2) in its 
front end portion (3a,3b) in an unround fashion. Possible 

designs of unround front ends are a flat (3b) or a shallow 
dimple (3a). With such design of the core pin the invention 

assures that the middle recycled layer does not reach the inner 
surface of the preform to give the preform - although recycled 

thermoplasts are used - food-compatibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of the invention are the injection moulding
machines, which may produce one or a plurality of multi-layer
preforms of thermoplastic material to be further manufactured
into one-way or multiway-containers, especially PET-bottles;
particularly a certain shape of the inner core (pin) of such
machinery and a method to improve the thickness distribution of
the inner layer of virgin thermoplastic material is addressed by
the invention.A number at layers ("multi-layer") are used for the preform and
different thermoplastic melts are successively used and pressed
through an injection orifice into a cylindrical cavity. At both
surfaces, the outer surface of the inner body and the inner
surface of the outer body consolidated layers are established,
leaving therebetween enough molten material, through which new
molten material of different thermoplastic material may be
introduced further up the preform. By such method a multi-layer
design is established for the preform, mostly having five
layers. Five layers are provided by injecting two different
types A,B of the molten thermoplastic material, having the
succession A,B,A.
An arrangement with an unround front end of the core pin
according to the preamble part of claim 1 is shown in
WO-A 91/16188 (Beck), specifically being a concavity or a
(full) flattening, as e.g. also shown in GB-A 2,010,734
(Emhart), however having a non semispherical front of the
core pin.The technical problem of the invention is to make one of the
cylindrical layers from recycled molten material ("post consumer
scrap" or "flake") and still guarantee that the inner layer of
first injected material is not penetrated and keeps a minimum
thickness.For solving said problem an arrangement is suggested for
manufacturing a preform according to the mentioned type and
having at its entire inner surface an inner layer with a minimum 
thickness, which guarantees that the following recycled layer of
the multi-layer does not reach near to the inner surface. The
arrangement is outlined in claim 1.Possibly contained detrimental substances in the recycled
material may therefore not reach the inner surface of the
preform and therefore not the inner surface of a bottle,
stretch-blown from said preform. The unround area is symmetrical
to the central axis of the elongated core (claim 1) and placed
in a half sphere surface of the core pin.Unround shapes of the front end of the core are a flattening or
lower level flattening or a combination made from a ring shaped
flattening and a centre
