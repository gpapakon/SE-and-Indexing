<ABSTRACT>
A three dimensional residual modeling operator is applied to seismic times that have been preprocessed by application of NMO and velocity independent DMO. The residual operator compensates for vertical velocity variation and anisotropy and its use precludes the need for ray tracing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of 3-D
migration of seismic data and is more particularly
concerned with correction of a dip-moveout (DMO)
operator for the effects of earth inhomogeneities such
as transverse anisotropy and ray bending due to a
variation in wavefield propagation velocity as a
function of depth.As is well known, DMO is a process for collapsing
non-zero offset seismic wavefield ray paths to zero-offset
normally-incident ray paths. DMO compensates
for dip and azimuth-dependent stacking velocities. In
the presence of a constant velocity medium, the DMO
operator is independent of velocity, it is two
dimensional and it is oriented along a line between the
source and receiver. In the presence of vertical,
lateral and angular velocity changes, singly or in
combination, the DMO operator becomes a three-dimensional
complex surface that is velocity dependent.Various authors have addressed the problem by
constructing a 3-D DMO operator from isochronal
surfaces. An isochronal surface defines the shape of a
reflector that will give the same arrival time at a
fixed location in a common offset section. The
required surface is found by ray tracing. Having found
the requisite surface, the DMO operator is created by
performing a modelling experiment assuming coincident
source-receiver locations. This and other similar
techniques tend to compensate the DMO operator for
refraction effects produced by velocity variations.
They do not address the problem of conflict of migrated
and unmigrated times. That problem arises because
velocities for DMO processing need to be defined at the
migrated time and location of the reflectors. However,
because during DMO processing the data have not been 
migrated, the energy of the reflectors is located at
their unmigrated positions. That creates a velocity
conflict among reflectors from different dips and
azimuths. A further problem is anistropy wherein the
stacking velocity is different for different azimuths
and dips.Deregowski and Rocca showed that a velocity-independent
DMO operator for a common offset section
can be expressed as:
t1 = t0 (1 - (x2/h2))½
where t1 is the zero-offset time, t0 is the normal
moveout (NMO) corrected time, x is the distance along
the midpoint section and h is half the source-to-receiver
offset. Equation (1) defines a velocity-independent
2-D DMO operator that moves energy in a
vertical plane along the source-to-receiver direction.
Formulation (1) may be extended to 3-D but only
provided a constant-velocity earth exists. It is
important to
