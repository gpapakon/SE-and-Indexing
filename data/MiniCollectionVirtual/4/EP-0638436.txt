<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface protective 
agent for a lithographic printing plate and to a cleaning agent 
for a lithographic printing plate. In the process for the preparation of a lithographic 
printing plate, the material is coated with a so-called gum 
solution at the final stage thereof. The object of coating with a gum solution is to protect 
the water wettability of the non-image area as well as to 
inhibit the contamination of the printing plate due to the 
attachment of scumming such as fingerprints, fats and oils and 
dust, and protect the printing plate against the occurrence of 
scratches during image correction such as addition and deletion 
on the image area, storage between plate making and printing or 
reuse, mounting on a printing machine, or in handling. 
Further, the object of coating with a gum solution is to 
inhibit the occurrence of oxidative contamination. As the gum 
solution for a lithographic printing plate, an aqueous solution 
of gum arabic, cellulose gum or water-soluble high molecular 
substance having carboxyl groups in its molecule has heretofore 
been normally used. However, such a gum solution has some 
disadvantages. In some detail, the final finishing process in  
 
the preparation of a printing plate is normally carried out by 
pouring a gum solution onto the printing plate, spreading the 
gum solution over the entire surface of the printing plate with 
a sponge, cotton tampon or the like, and then rubbing the 
surface of the printing plate with the sponge, cotton tampon or 
the like until it is dried. As a result, the image area (ink-receptive 
area) is partly coated thickly with a water-soluble 
high molecular substance. The thickly coated image area 
exhibits a reduced ink-receptivity during printing. Thus, a 
considerable number of sheets of paper must be wasted until a 
printed matter having a desired ink density can be obtained. 
In general, this phenomenon is called printing fault (so-called 
poor ink-receptivity). In order to recover the lost image area 
against the foregoing difficulty, a process is normally 
required which comprises washing the printing plate with water 
or a weakly acidic solution to remove a hydrophilic colloid 
from the image area. Since this washing process requires much 
time, a gum remover has been developed as disclosed in JP-B-56-19277 
(the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined 
Japanese patent publication"). On the other hand, it is a common practice to cover the 
image area with fats and oils before gumming
