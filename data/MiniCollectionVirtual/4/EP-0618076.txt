<ABSTRACT>
In the case that one pixel is recorded with 
a maximum number of three dots, each dot is 

recorded by performing different scanning 
operations (a first scanning operation and a 

second scanning operation). At this time, the 
recording paper is conveyed in the forward 

direction for a certain period of time between 
the first scanning operation and the second 

scanning operation, causing ink to be ejected 
from different ejection orifices during each 

scanning operation. With respect to the 
assignment for allowing each dot to be recorded 

on the recording paper during which scanning 
operation, a first scanning operation is assigned 

to a third dot without fail (C and D). Thus, the 
number of dots to be recorded during the first 

preceding scanning operation is larger than the 
number of dots to be recorded during the 

subsequent scanning operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
apparatus adapted to achieve a printing operation
in a multi-gray scale mode by performing scanning
operations by several times with the aid of an
ink jet head having a plurality of ink ejection
orifices formed thereon. Further, the present
invention relates to an ink jet method to be
practiced by operating an ink jet apparatus of
the foregoing type.It should be noted that the ink jet
apparatus and the ink jet method to which the
present invention has been applied should not be
limited only to an ink jet apparatus and an ink
jet method both of which are employable for
recording characters, images or the like on a
paper. Alternatively, the present invention may
equally be applied to an ink jet apparatus and an
ink jet method both of which are employable for
ejecting ink to a cloth or a various medium and
fixing thereto (hereinafter referred to widely as
printing).There have been hitherto known various kinds
of methods each capable of expressing a gray
scale of each image or the like in accordance
with an ink jet system. The conventional methods as mentioned above
are exemplified by a method of changing an area
of each pixel by changing a size of each ink
droplet ejected from an ink ejection orifice
(Area gray scale method), a method of expressing
a gray scale by changing the number of dots on
the assumption that an assembly of dots formed
with ejected ink droplets is counted as one pixel
(Density pattern method, Dither method or the
like), a method of performing a recording
operation using inks each having a different
density of color (Different density method), and
a method of expressing a gray scale by changing
an area of each dot or a density of color of the
dot depending on the number of ink droplets shot
onto a recording medium on the assumption that
one dot is formed by shooting a plurality of ink
droplets onto the recording medium (multi-droplet
method). A term "shot" means that ink for
forming a pixel is ejected to the pixel. Among
the aforementioned conventional methods, the
multi-droplet method is expected as a method of
enabling each recording operation or each
printing operation to be performed at a high
speed while expressing a high resolution and a
great many gray levels.However, since the conventional multi-droplet
system is practiced such that a single
pixel is formed with ink droplets ejected from a
same ejection orifice, in the case that
the direction of ejecting a series of ink
droplets and a quantity of each ejected ink
fluctuate (variation)
