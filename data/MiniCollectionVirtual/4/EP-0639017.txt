<ABSTRACT>
A system for selecting the functions provided by a telephone 
set by combining each service with only one specific control 

operation. Such control operation actuates a succession of 
already stored codes which are detected by a call handling 

block (4). A light indicator is further provided relating to 
call warning service.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multifunction telephone set and 
more particularly to a system for selecting the functions 
provided by a telephone set allowing a specific service to 
be activated in an easier, then "friendly" way to the user. 
Such simplification as well as the greater reliability is 
obtained through a selection system using only one control 
operation (for example, the keystroke of a specific key) for 
actuating the corresponding function. The provision of digital exchanges in the telephone network 
by SIP (the Italian Phone Service Company) offers to the 
users a large range of additional phone services which could 
not be provided by the old electromechanical exchanges which 
are on the way of full extinction.
 
Some services are at present offered to the applicant, and 
namely: 
call warning;  call transfer;  direct distance dialling block;  remote counter readout.  
When the user enabled to the additional phone services wants 
to select one of the above-mentioned services, he can strike 
the keys of the keyboard of a telephone set capable of emitting 
multifrequency tones, thus generating a complicated  
 
succession of codes and symbols (* and #); in this way the 
requested service is made available by the telephone exchange.
 
The described operations make the use of the telephone set 
and the access to the additional services offered to the 
digital exchange very complex. Therefore, there is the need 
of simplifying the use of the telephone set to the advantage 
of the user and the Phone Service Company as well.
 
Furthermore, as far as the call warning service is specifically 
concerned, it is activated by an exchange signal of 
425 Hz and -15 dB; such signal having a typical frequency of 
the voice band could be detected in a voice signal containing 
such frequency, thus providing an unwanted activation 
of the service. The present invention seeks to provide a system for selecting 
the functions provided by a telephone set by combining 
each requested service with only one specific control 
operation (for example, a keystroke of a key). A further object of the present invention is of providing a 
system for selecting the functions provided by the telephone 
set which allows the plurality of services offered by the 
telephone set to remain unchanged as well as the operations 
relating to the selection of a specific service to be 
generally simplified. Still another object of the present invention is of providing  
 
a system for selecting the functions provided by the 
telephone

<CLAIMS>
Service selection system for a multifunction telephone 
set, characterized in that each available service is associated 

to only one specific control operation as well as one 
specific non-volatile memory in which the successions of 

codes relative to the actuation of the corresponding service 
are stored, such code successions being handled by a call 

handling block (4) which is capable of storing information 
regarding the state of the connected devices, detecting the 

protocol signals in the telephone set, and actuating or not 
the selection of a specific additional service as a result 

of such detection. 
Service selection system for a multifunction telephone 
set according to the preceding claim, characterized in that 

a block (3) consisting of an amplification circuit and a selective 
filter at 425 Hz which detects the audio signal of 

the call warning from the exchange and feeds such signal to 
the call handling block (4) which switches on a LED in case 

the call warning service has been activated.
