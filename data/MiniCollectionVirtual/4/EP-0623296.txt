<ABSTRACT>
A buckle (10) for fastening loose ends of a strap 
or the like comprises a male or plug member (11) and a 

female or socket member (12) releasably engageable 
therewith. The plug member (11) includes an 

elastically deformable locking arm (23) and a 
retaining lug (24) underlying and supporting the arm 

(23) when the latter undergoes elastic deformation 
upon engagement with an engaging surface (14b) formed 

in the socket member (12). The locking arm (23) has 
an elongated arcuate cavity (24d) for snapping 

engagement with a complementarily shaped engaging 
surface (14b) in the socket member (12) to ensure 

stable coupling of the two members (11) and (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a buckle for releasably 
connecting straps, belts or the like on bags or like 
garment articles. Numerous forms of buckles are known. An exemplary buckle device disclosed in 
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 54-14317 
comprises a male member and a female member releasably 
engageable therewith, the male member having a resilient 
locking arm provided at its forward end with a locking 
lug and a rigid positioning arm underlying the locking 
arm, and the female member having a tunnel-like 
receptacle dimensioned to receive the two arms. When 
the male member is inserted into the female member with 
the locking lug of the locking arm hooked around the 
edge of an opening in the receptacle, the positioning 
arm lies flat against a base plate of the female member 
and serves to retain the locking arm in locked position 
relative to the female member. A similar buckle device 
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 
61-160618, in which a locking arm and a positioning arm  
 
extend in parallel relation from a male member for 
resilient engagement with a female member, the 
positioning arm being exposed to view through an opening 
in the locking arm when separated from the female member 
but concealed under a bridge wall of the female member 
when coupled with the male member. The locking member 
has a locking lug formed at its rearward end for 
abutting engagement with an end wall edge of the bridge. 
In either of the prior art buckle devices, the locking 
arm of the male member flexed downwardly or sags upon 
entry into the female member to an extent determined by 
the height of the locking lug that comes into hooked 
engagement with a mating part of the female member. If 
inadvertently a force was applied in a direction in 
which the locking arm sags, it would tend to break or 
otherwise lose its spring-back action. This is more 
likely as the locking arm is cantilevered. An attempt 
to increase mechanical strength of the material for the 
locking arm would conversely reduce its elastic modulus 
in flexture. This could be compensated for by reducing 
the height of the locking lug but would result in 
unreliable operation of the buckle. With the foregoing difficalities of the prior art 
in view, the present invention seeks to provide 
improvements in a buckle which incorporates structural 
features such that its male and female members can be 
coupled and uncoupled with utmost ease and reliability. More specifically, the invention seeks to provide  
 
a buckle which

characterized in that plug member (11) has a retaining 

lug (24) cantilevered at said planar portion (23a) of 
said locking arm (23). 
A buckle (10) for fastening a strap on the 
like which comprises a plug member (11) and a socket 

member (12) releasable engageable therewith, said 
socket member (12) having an upper shield (14) and a 

lower shield (15) disposed in spaced parallel relation 
to define therebetween a guide channel (18), said 

upper shield (14) having a bevelled engaging surface 
(14b), and said plug member (11) having a support base
