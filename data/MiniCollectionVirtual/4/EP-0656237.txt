<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a casting apparatus intended particularly for production of metal components in small and medium-sized series. The casting apparatus of the invention includes a frame (8) for supporting a permanent mould (2), a sole plate (11), two permanent-mould cheeks (3) which can be displaced by means of couplings (14) through the action of cheek rams (jacks) (7a), cheek ram holders (12a, 12b) mounted on the frame and ram holders (15) of a member for reservation of a cavity (6), characterised in that the couplings of the cheek rams and at least one of the said ram holders of a member for reservation are directly supported removably by the cheeks and/or the sole plate. The present invention applies particularly to the manufacture of components made from alumium alloy.

Moulding die holder (2) intended in particular for the production of
metal parts in small and medium series, comprising a die support frame,

a base plate (11) possibly forming the die bottom portion, at least two
parts forming die box parts (3) displaceable through the medium of

harnesses (14) under the action of box part jacks (7a), box part jack
carriers (12a,b) mounted onto the said frame and jack carriers (15) for

hollows reservation members such as spindle cores (6) or cores,
characterized in that the harnesses (14) of the box part jacks (7a) are

directly supported in a removable manner by the said box parts (3) and
in that at least one of the said jack carriers (15) for the reservation

members (6) is directly supported in a removable manner by the said
box parts (3) and/or the said base plate (11).
Moulding die holder according to claim 1, characterized in that the free
ends (31, 31a) of the harnesses (14) of the box part jacks (7a) and of the

jack carriers (15) for reservation members (6) are adapted to be fitted in
a removable manner onto catching members (29) such as lugs which are

projecting from the external surface of the moulding die (2).
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that it comprises a removable coupling means (40)

connecting the rod (38) of each jack (7a, 7b) to its corresponding
movable member, namely a harness (14) of a box part jack (7a) or a

support (28) for a reservation member (6), each coupling means (40)
comprising a projecting portion (40b) adapted to come in abutment upon

the box part jack carriers (12a, 12b, 12') or the reservation member jack
carriers (15) for limiting the useful stroke of each rod (38) of jack (7a,

7b), each coupling means (40) being interchangeable and belonging to a
range of modules with predetermined lengths so as to adjust the said

useful stroke of each jack. 
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the box part jack carriers (12a, 12b, 12') are

mounted onto the frame (8) of the moulding die holder (1) in a
removable and adjustable manner for example by means of an indexing

system (13a, 13b), each box part jack carrier (12a, 12b, 12') being
interchangeable and belonging to a range of modules with

predetermined shapes.
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the box part jack carriers (12') comprise several

tiers of jacks (7a) working in parallel relationship.
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that a hole (21) is bored through the base plate carrying

wall (10) of the frame (8) of the moulding die holder (1) at the place
intended to receive the base plate (11), the said through-hole (21) being

adapted to receive reduction frames (42) nestable into each other and
belonging to a range of modules with predetermined dimensions.
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that each harness (14) superposes itself to at least one

jack carrier (15) for a reservation member (6).
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the upper face of the base plate carrying wall (10)

of the frame (8) is provided with an indexing device (23, 24) intended to
cooperate with lugs (22) which are projecting underneath the base plate

(11) so as to position the latter onto the base plate carrier wall (10).
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that the upper reservation member jack carrier consists

of a gantry (16) adapted to be mounted in a removable manner onto the
frame (8). 
Moulding die holder according to any one of the foregoing claims,
characterized in that a central processing unit (43, 44) controls and

operates the actuation of the moulding die holder (1) through the
medium of at least one programmable automaton (45a, 45b, 45c), each

automaton (45b) being adapted to deal with a plurality of moulding die
holders of the invention (1a to 1f) and to actuate in a independent and

selective manner the instant jacks (7a, 7b) mounted on each moulding
die holder (1).
