<ABSTRACT>
A device (12), such as an A/D converter for generating successive 
codes, each in accordance with the level of an input analog voltage, may be tested to 

determine if all codes have been generated by applying a voltage V
t
 having an 
amplitude that varies between 0 and V volts. The variation in the voltage V
t
 is such 
that when the device (12) is operating properly, it will generate all of its codes 

during a predetermined interval. Each code generated by the device (12) is 
compared by a comparator (18) to the count of an 
n
-bit counter (20) whose count is 
initialized at zero. Each time the count of the counter (20) matches the code 

produced by the device (12), the counter is incremented. If the counter overfiows 
(i.e., its count has exceeded 2
n
-1) within a prescribed interval, then the device (12) is 
said to be operating properly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a testing technique for detecting the presence of 
all codes generated by a device such as an Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter or the 
like. Digital circuitry has supplanted analog circuitry in many electronic 
systems, especially those used in data processing and telecommunications. Within 
such digital systems, there is often a need to process one or more analog signals, 
such as an analog video or voice signal, which may vary from 0 to V volts. To 
facilitate the processing by digital circuit elements within the electronic system, the 
analog signal is converted to a corresponding digital signal by an Analog-to-Digital 
(A/D) converter which serves to generate a digital word (i.e., a code) corresponding 
to the amplitude of the analog signal at a given instant To more fully approximate 
the analog signal, the A/D converter samples the analog signal periodically. Such 
A/D converters are well known in the art. The functionality of the A/D converter depends on its ability to generate 
all possible codes, (i.e., all 2n codes for an n-bit-wide A/D converter). In other 
words, the A/D converter should be capable of converting any analog voltage 
between 0 and V volts into the corresponding digital code. Failure of the A/D 
converter to convert a particular analog voltage to the corresponding digital code 
represents a fault (i.e., an error) which affects the A/D converter operation. To date, 
there has not been an efficient scheme for accomplishing built-in, self-testing of an 
A/D converter or a similar type of device to determine its ability to generate all 
possible codes. Thus there is a need for a technique for accomplishing built-in self-testing 
of an A/D converter or the like to determine its ability to generate all possible 
digital codes. Briefly, in accordance with the invention, a technique is disclosed for 
accomplishing all code testing of a device in accordance with the method of claim 1.  FIGURE 1 is a block schematic diagram of an apparatus, in accordance 
with the invention, for testing whether an A/D converter has generated all of its 
possible codes. Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown an apparatus 10, in accordance with 
the invention, for testing an n-bit-wide A/D converter 12 (or a similar device which 
generates all 2n, n-bit-wide codes) to determine whether the device is capable of 
generating all of its possible codes. The apparatus 10 includes a voltage source 14 
for generating an analog voltage Vt which varies between 0 and V volts. The 
voltage Vt

<CLAIMS>
A method for testing an n-bit-wide device which generates a separate 
one of a set of codes, each in response to a corresponding amplitude of analog 

voltage applied thereto, to determine if the device can generate all of its codes, 
CHARACTERIZED BY the steps of: 


(a) applying to the device a voltage Vt having an amplitude which 
varies from 0 to V volts over time such that when the device is operating properly, 

the applied voltage Vt causes the device to successively generate all of its codes 
sufficiently often; 
(b) comparing each code generated by the device to a count of an n-bit 
counter initialized at zero; 
(c) incrementing the count of the counter each time the code generated 
by the device matches the count of the counter; 
(d) checking, after a prescribed interval, whether the counter has 
generated a carry bit to signify an overflow condition, which will occur when the 

device is operating properly. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the voltage Vt is periodic 
and has a smoothly varying amplitude. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the voltage Vt has a 
randomly varying amplitude. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the counter is initialized by 
applying a reset signal thereto at the outset of operation. 
Apparatus for testing an n-bit-wide device which generates a separate 
one of a set of codes, each in response to a corresponding amplitude of analog 

voltage applied thereto, to determine if the device can generate all of its codes, the 
apparatus CHARACTERIZED BY: 

   means for supplying to the device a voltage Vt having an amplitude 
which varies from 0 to V volts such that the device, when operating properly, will 

generate all of its codes; 
   a counter for generating an n-bit count initialized at zero and which 

increases monotonically each time the counter is incremented, and for generating a 
carry bit whose state is indicative of whether
 the count of the counter has been 
 

incremented beyond 2n-1; 
   a comparator for comparing the code generated by the device to the 

count of the counter and for incrementing the counter when the counter count and the 
code produced by the device match. 
The apparatus according to claim 5 wherein the voltage-supplying 
means comprises: 

   a voltage source for generating a voltage having an amplitude which 
varies from 0 to V volts; and 

   a multiplexer for multiplexing the voltage supplied from the voltage 
source with a signal K which is normally supplied to the device during non-testing 

intervals, so that the device receives the signal K during non-testing intervals and 
receives the voltage from the voltage source during testing intervals. 
The apparatus according to claim 6 wherein the voltage supplied by 
the voltage source has a smoothly varying amplitude. 
The apparatus according to claim 5 further including means for 
inhibiting the counter from counting once its count has gone one beyond 2n-1. 
The apparatus according to claim 8 wherein said inhibiting means 
includes a logic gate for combining the output signal of the comparator and the carry 

bit of the counter to yield an increment signal which causes the counter to be 
incremented only when the output code of the device and the counter count match 

and only when the counter count is less than 2n.
