<ABSTRACT>
A feeder device (1) for introducing chemical 
(25) into a pool (101) comprises a body (3) 

defining a flow path (9) for the passage of pool 
water, a feeder (19) opening into the flow path 

(9) retaining a supply of chemical (25) to be 
exposed to erosion by pool water caused to flow 

along the flow path (9), and shield means (19) for 
partially shielding the chemical with respect to 

the flow of water. In use, the shield means (19) 
and chemical (25) are relatively movable to one 

another, to selectively regulate the degree of 
exposure of the chemical (25) to the flow of pool 

water. 
A method of introducing chemical using the 
feeder device (11) and a system (100, 120) 

arranged to incorporate the device and to perform 
the method are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a feeder device 
particularly a feeder device for introducing 
chemical into a swimming pool. Swimming pools are normally treated by a 
chlorine donor. Calcium Hypochlorite is one of 
the more popular of these donors but is usually 
available in granular form. However, calcium 
hypochlorite has an inherent characteristic of 
forming scale, blockage and sedimentation which 
has caused other types of feeders to malfunction. A system for treating water is disclosed in 
US-A-4732689. This system comprises two vertical 
feeder tubes containing chemical tablets, 
extending into a bath. The bath receives water 
from a main via an inlet branch pipe. The bath 
includes a linear weir, thus rendering the level 
of water in the bath directly proportional to the 
flow of water into the bath. Vertical slots 
extend from the lower end of each of the feeder 
tubes, thus exposing the tablets to the water. 
Thus the area of tablet exposed to water is 
directly proportional to the flow rate of water 
through the system. The linear weir of this device is a precision 
engineered component, and the system is entirely  
 
dependent on flow rate. The device also relies on 
there being sufficient chemical tablets in the 
feeders that the stacks extend above the water 
surface in the bath for the entire range of the 
level of the surface. Thus a large quantity of 
chemical must be stocked. An object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved feeder device. According to the present invention there is 
provided a feeder device for introducing chemical 
into a pool comprising a body defining a flow path 
for the passage of pool water, a feeder opening 
into the flow path retaining a supply of chemical 
to be exposed to erosion by pool water caused to 
flow along the flow path, and shield means for 
partially shielding the chemical with respect to 
the flow of water, in use the shield means and 
chemical being relatively movable to one another 
to selectively regulate the degree of exposure of 
the chemical to the flow of pool water. The shield means may be movable to regulate 
the degree of exposure of the chemical to the flow 
of pool water. Preferably, the shield means 
comprises a portion of the feeder extending into 
the flow path, and the feeder further includes 
interengaging means on the feeder and on the body  
 
whereby the feeder is movably engaged with the 
body, in use movement of the feeder in a direction 
transverse to the flow of water moving the shield 
means with respect to the

regulate the degree of exposure of the chemical to 

the flow of water. 
A feeder device according to claim 1 
wherein the shield means is movable to regulate 

the degree of exposure of the chemical to the flow 
of water. 
A feeder device according to claim 1 or 2 
wherein the shield means comprises a portion of 

the feeder extending into the flow path, and the 
feeder further includes interengaging means on the 

feeder and on the body whereby the feeder is 
movably engaged with the body, in use movement of 

the feeder in a direction transverse to the flow 
of water moving the shield means with respect to 

the chemical thereby exposing more or less 
chemical according to the direction of movement. 
A feeder device according to claim 3 
wherein the interengaging means comprises cooperative 

screw threads on the feeder and the 
body. 
The feeder device of any preceding claim 
further including isolation valve means arranged 

to selectively isolate partially or wholly the 
feeder device from the flow of the pool water as 

desired. 
The feeder device of any preceding claim 
further including control valve means arranged in 

use to control the flow of pool water along the 
flow path as desired. 
The feeder device of any preceding claim 
including a platform disposed opposite the feeder 

on which a lowermost chemical tablet rests in use. 
A feeder of any preceding claim including 
spring means adapted to bias chemical tablets in 

use into position on the flow path. 
The feeder device of any preceding claim 
wherein the feeder includes observation means 

enabling observation of the amount of chemical
