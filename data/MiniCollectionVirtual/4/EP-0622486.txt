<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circular knitting 
machines and more particularly to a fabric take-up 
mechanism for such circular knitting machines. Circular knitting machines have rotating 
cylinders and knitting instrumentalities which produce 
a tubular fabric which rotates with the cylinder. It 
is known to withdraw the fabric being formed downwardly 
through the rotating cylinder by a fabric take-up 
mechanism including a plurality of delivery rolls which 
flatten the tubular fabric and wind the flattened 
fabric around a take-up roll. In such circular 
knitting machines, the take-up mechanism rotates 
synchronously with the cylinder to avoid twisting of 
the fabric as it rotates with the needle cylinder. Conventionally, the take-up speed of the 
take-up mechanism of the circular knitting machine is 
adjusted while the machine is not in operation to a 
preset value calculated to maintain the fabric under 
tension when the knitting machine knits the maximum 
length of fabric it is capable of producing for that 
type of fabric. However, if the length of fabric being 
knitted varies from this maximum length because of 
different stitch construction, different types of yarn, 
or variation in the stitch lengths being formed,  
 
tension in the fabric as reflected in at least one of 
the delivery rolls will gradually increase during 
knitting to the point that the fabric is torn or 
knitting needles are placed under sufficient stress 
that breakage occurs. Previous attempts to solve this 
problem have either failed or have been only partially 
successful. One such prior attempt provides a detector 
for detecting substantial increases in tension in the 
fabric and a stop motion to stop the knitting machine 
when such tension exceeds a predetermined maximum 
allowable value. While avoiding torn fabric or 
breakage of needles, such an attempt resulted in 
substantial downtime for knitting machines and reduced 
production, as well as substantial operator time in 
making manual adjustments of the take-up speed of the 
knitting machines. Another suggested solution to the problem is 
disclosed in the United States Patent No. 4,671,083, 
owned by the same assignee as is this application. In 
this patent, a variable speed drive is disclosed 
involving a belt and variable pulleys which respond 
somewhat to the tension in the fabric to vary the speed 
of the take-up mechanism to reduce the tension in the 
fabric due to belt slippage in the pulleys. The drive 
mechanism for the take-up unit disclosed in United 
States
