<ABSTRACT>
Pushbutton-distributor characterized in that the upper part (4) of its body (1) is surrounded by a ring (2) which is free to rotate but which is wedged in axial translation, and radialy extended by a manual actuation lever (18), and in that the edge (21) of the ring on the side of the body base is diametrally inclined, the ring being shorter below the lever, while its longer side, diametrally opposite to the lever, is in the immediate vicinity of a circular shoulder (5) of the external wall of the base (3) of the body.

<CLAIMS>
Lockable dispenser button for aerosol valves 
including a one-piece body whose base (3) includes means 

(14-15) for fixing it to an aerosol container (12) and 
the upper part (4) of which is articulated to the base by 

a flexible tongue defined by a cut-out (6) in the wall of 
the body and includes at the side a dispenser nozzle (7) 

located above the articulation tongue and connected to an 
axial tube (10) connected to the hollow actuator and 

dispenser rod (11) of the valve, which dispenser button 
is characterised in that the upper part (4) of its body 

(1) is surrounded by a ring (2) which is free to rotate 
but which is prevented from axial movement in translation 

and is extended radially by a manual operating lever (18) 
and in that the edge (21) of the ring towards the base of 

the body is inclined, the ring being shorter on the side 
in vertical alignment with the lever, whereas its longer 

side, diametrally opposite the lever, is in the immediate 
vicinity of a circular shoulder (5) on the outside wall 

of the base (3) of the body so that when, by rotating the 
ring, the lever is moved to the side opposite the nozzle 

it can be depressed to operate the valve by inclining the 
upper part of the body on the base by virtue of the 

articulation tongue located under the nozzle and because 
the ring is shorter on the side under the lever whereas, 

if the lever is on the same side as the nozzle, it cannot 
be depressed because the articulation tongue is then 

under the lever and the longer side of the ring is 
abutted against the shoulder on the base, opposite the 

lever, so that the dispenser button is immobilised in 
this position to prevent unintentional actuation of the 

valve. 
Dispenser button according to claim 1 
characterised in that the wall of the ring (2) and the 

lever (18) have extensions (21, 22, 23) forming a screen  
 

in front of the nozzle (7) when the dispenser button is 
in its locked position. 
Dispenser button according to claim 1 or claim 
2 characterised in that the edge (21) of the ring (2) is 

inclined to the axis of the ring at approximately 7°. 
Dispenser button according to any one of claims 
1 to 3 characterised in that the axis of the nozzle (7) 

is inclined to the axis of the upper part (4) of the body 
at approximately 120°, the nozzle discharging normally 

onto a frustoconical wall (8) at the end of the upper 
part of the body. 
Dispenser button according to any one of claims 
1 to 4 characterised in that the ring (2) and the upper 

part (4) of the body carry complementary indexing means 
of the elastic lug/notch type (24, 25, 26) for locating 

the lever (18) carried by the ring on the same side as 
the nozzle (7) in the locked position, and on the 

opposite side to the nozzle in the operative position. 
Aerosol packaging characterised in that it 
includes a dispenser button in accordance with any one of 

claims 1 to 5.
