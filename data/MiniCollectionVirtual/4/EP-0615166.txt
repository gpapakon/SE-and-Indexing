<ABSTRACT>
A resin for electrophotographic toner comprising a 
degradable polyester resin which is an amorphous poly( α -hydroxycarboxylic 

acid) prepared by direct dehydration-polycondensation 
of anα -hydroxycarboxylic acid and having, 

preferably, a number-average molecular weight ranging from 2000 
to 7000. A further resin for electrophotographic toner 

comprising a degradable polyester resin which may be prepared 
by reacting an amorphous or semicrystalline poly( α -hydroxycarboxylic 

acid), having a number-average molecular 
weight ranging from 1000 to 7000 or 2000 to 7000 and prepared by 

direct dehydration-polycondensation of anα -hydroxycarboxylic 
acid, with a polyol having at least three hydroxyl groups or a 

polycarboxylic acid having at least three carboxyl groups in the 
molecule and, in case of the reaction product with the polyol 

can further be reacted with a diisocyanate to give an urethane-modified 
polyester. These polyesters can likewise be used as 

resins for toner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin used in a toner
for use in electrophotography and more specifically to a
degradable binder resin for electrophotographic toners.The electrophotography technique comprises the steps of
forming, through a variety of means, electrostatic latent images
on a light-sensitive material while making use of a
photoconductive substance, then developing the latent images
with a toner, optionally transferring the images on an image-support
such as paper and thereafter fixing the toner images
thus formed by passing through, for instance, heated rolls to
thus give desired images. There have been investigated a variety
of substances for use as resins for preparing toners. Among
these, polyester resins have widely been used as resins for
preparing heated roll-fixable toners, because of their good
ability for dispersing, therein, various additives for toners
such as carbon black, good ability for wetting transfer paper and
excellent fixability or the like.In addition, the quantity of paper commonly used in
copying apparatuses and optical printers have rapidly been
increased recently and the amount of paper wasted or burned
is correspondingly increased. This becomes a serious
problem from the viewpoint of conservation of natural resources
and the techniques for reclaiming and reusing such paper 
commonly used have been increasingly important from the
viewpoint of prevention of environmental pollution and
conservation of natural resources. To this end, it is desirable
that the toner used in copying apparatuses and optical printers
be able to efficiently be decomposed through alkali
hydrolysis during deinking and reclaiming processes for paper
and efficiently be removed from the fibers of the paper. In
this respect, styrene binder resins usually used are hardly
hydrolyzed with an alkali. On the other hand, it is known that
resins for toner comprising degradable polyesters such as poly-(
α -hydroxycarboxylic acid) exhibit high deinkability and are
thus useful in the paper-recycle (see, for instance, WO
92/01245). Moreover, abandoned toners and/or resins for toners
are sometimes buried in the ground. However, the conventional
resins for toners are insufficient in biodegradability. For this
reason, there has been a desire for improvement of these
resins for toners from the viewpoint of disposition of waste
and environmental pollution. In this respect, it has been known
that the toners comprising degradable polyesters are decomposed
in the ground (see, for instance, Japanese Un-examined
