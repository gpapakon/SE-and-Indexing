<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for removing or reducing in a dosed manner liquids remaining on rolled materials after rolling. In order to avoid the abrasive operation of the wiping process, without imparting to said process and device the inconvenients of squeezing rollers, at least two successive rollers (5, 4; 2, 3) are laid on the rolled material (14) and the liquid to be removed, or part therefrom, is sucked off from a suction chamber (25, 26) formed between the pair of rollers.
