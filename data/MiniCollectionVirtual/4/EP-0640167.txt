<ABSTRACT>
A snap-on, plastic hinged closure in a single piece has a bottom part and a lid interconnected by an integral hinge in the area of the superimposed outer walls of the bottom part and lid, as well as at least one intermediate element that ensures the snap-on effect. The hinge consists of at least two non-intersecting swivelling axes (6). A pressure-resistant tilting element (7) is arranged between two adjacent swivelling axes (6), so that during opening or closing, first the bottom part (1) and the tilting element (7), then the tilting element (7) and the lid (2) partially swivel around the swivelling axis (6).

One-piece plastic snap-hinge closure comprising a base (1) and a cover (2), 
which are interconnected by means of an integral joint in the vicinity of the 

superimposed circumferential walls (10, 11) of the base and the cover, as well 
as at least one intermediate element (3) producing the snap action, characterized 

in that the joint comprises at least two non-intersecting pivot pins (6) 
and in addition to the intermediate element (3) between in each case two 

adjacent pivot pins (6) is provided a compression-resistant tilting element (7), 
so that during the closing or opening process there is successively in each 

case a partial pivoting about the pivot pins (6) between the base (1) and the 
tilting element (7) and a further partial pivoting about the pivot pins (6) 

between the tilting element (7) and the cover (2), the tilting element (7) 
having on both sides a support surface (15) and in the closed state of the 

closure, one support surface (15) engages on a mating surface (16) on the base 
(1) and the other support surface (15) on a mating surface (17) on the cover 

(2). 
One-piece plastic snap-hinge closure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the two pivot pins (6) have at least one parallel section between which is 

positioned the compression-resistant tilting element (7) (fig. 3). 
One-piece snap-hinge closure according to claim 1, characterized in that 
in the closed state of the closure the two pivot pins (6) are mirror symmetrical 

to the separating plane (T). 
One-piece plastic snap-hinge closure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the tilting element (7) has a cross-section in the form of an isosceles 

triangle. 
One-piece plastic snap-hinge closure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the tilting element (7) has a cross-section in the form of an equal-
sided 
trapezium. 
One-piece plastic snap-hinge closure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that, with respect to the periphery of the plastic snap-hinge closure, the tilting 

element (7) projects inwards.  
 
One-piece plastic snap-hinge closure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that in the completely opened state of the closure, the angle between one support 

surface (15) of the tilting element (7) and the mating surface (16) on the 
base (1), as well as the angle between the other support surface (15) and the 

mating surface (17) on the cover (2) is in each case 90°. 
One-piece plastic snap-hinge closure according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the angle between the two support surfaces (15) of the tilting element (7) 

is less than 90°.
