<ABSTRACT>
A wingsail assembly comprising at least one rigid thrust wing (1) mounted for free rotation about an upright axis (8). The assembly including means (11) for rotating or translating at least a portion of the thrust wing so as to adjust the location of the instantaneous centre of pressure (9) of the thrust wing with respect to the upright axis. The thrust wing is trimmed by an upwind auxiliary vane (7), freely pivoted upwind of its centre of pressure, the angle of attack of the auxiliary vane being controlled by the position of a secondary control aerofoil (15) positioned downwind from the auxiliary vane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wingsails and especially to 
self-trimming wingsails. A wingsail is an assembly including one or more aerofoil 
sections, usually rigid, that is mounted span upright to 
propel a vessel. European patent specifications 61291, 
96554 and 328254 and GB-A-198649 describe various aspects of wingsails, 
including self-trimming wingsails, of a general type to 
which the present invention has particular relevance. In 
such a self-trimming wingsail the angle of attack of a main 
thrust wing or wings about an upright axis is controlled by 
an auxiliary control aerofoil or vane, called a tail vane, 
mounted on a boom extending downwind from the thrust wing. 
Success with designs incorporating upwind auxiliary control 
aerofoils has not so far been achieved. With the prior art self-trimming arrangements incorporating 
a tail vane, the wingsail assembly has a substantial overall 
trimming circle which is acceptable on craft with a wide 
beam, such as multi-hull sailing vessels or on ships where 
wingsails are used as auxiliary power, when the trimming 
circle will remain within the plan area of the craft, but 
on narrower single hulled craft the trimming circle might 
overhang the gunwales, which is not very practical. One 
aspect of the present invention is therefore directed 
towards providing a self-trimming rig with a more compact 
trimming circle. Another problem that can arise with self-trimming wingsails 
is that the movement of the centre of pressure of the main 
thrust wing as the angle of attack changes, or as the 
relative deflection of the wing elements are changed, 
changes the effective turning moment about the main axis of 
the thrust wing. If the centre of pressure of the main 
thrust wing is too far from the main axis the compensatory  
 
trimming moment required from the auxiliary vane is greater, 
which in turn leads to a requirement for a larger auxiliary 
vane and more powerful associated deflection control 
mechanisms, or to a longer boom and therefore a larger 
trimming circle. Other aspects of the invention are 
directed towards controlling the position of the centre of 
pressure with respect to the main thrust wing axis, and to 
techniques for minimising the power requirements for 
auxiliary vane movement. Accordingly the invention provides a wingsail assembly 
comprising a wingsail assembly comprising at least one 
thrust wing mounted about an upright axis and trimmed by an 
auxiliary vane mounted upwind of the thrust wing 
characterised by the thrust wing being

<CLAIMS>
A wingsail assembly comprising at least one thrust wing 
(1) mounted about an upright axis (4) and trimmed 

by an auxiliary vane (7) mounted upwind of the thrust wing 
characterised by the thrust wing being freely rotatable 

about the upright axis, by means for moving (11) the thrust 
wing to provide a predetermined distance between the 

instantaneous centre of pressure of the thrust wing and its 

upright axis of rotation and by the auxiliary vane 
itself being trimmed by a secondary control vane (15) 

mounted downwind of the auxiliary vane within a turning 
circle defined by the thrust wing and auxiliary vane. 
A wingsail assembly according to claim 1 in which the 
thrust wing is pivoted at its base about a substantially 

horizontal axis (10) to enable the leading edge of the 
thrust wing to be pivoted forwardly. 
A wingsail assembly according to any preceding claim in 
which the thrust wing is forwardly pivotable to a recumbent 

position. 
A wingsail assembly according to any preceding claim 
further comprising a balance mass provided with means for 

moving the mass downstream as the thrust wing is moved 
upstream. 
A wingsail assembly according to claim 1 or claim 4 in 
which the secondary vane is mounted on a boom extending 

downwind from the auxiliary vane. 
A wingsail assembly according to claim 1 or claim 4 in 
which the secondary vane is mounted at the trailing edge 

of the auxiliary vane.  
 
A wingsail assembly according to claim 1 or claim 6 in 
which the secondary vane is mounted on a boom extending 

downwind from the auxiliary vane. 
A wingsail assembly according to claim 1 or claim 6 in 
which the secondary vane is mounted at the trailing edge 

of the auxiliary vane. 
A marine craft including a wingsail assembly according 
to any preceding claim.
