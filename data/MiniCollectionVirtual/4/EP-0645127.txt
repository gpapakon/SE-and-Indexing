<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a joint prosthesis extractor comprising a curved tool head (2) which has a passage (6) for reception of a prosthetic stem and a locking device (8, 10, 12) which releasably blocks the prosthetic stem (4) in the passage, characterised in that the locking device (8, 10, 12) has a locking member (8) which engages in the passage and whose engagement position can be adjusted to suit different diameters of the prosthetic stem. An actuating force serving to adjust the engagement position and acting upon the locking member (8) is transmitted along the curved tool head.

A knockout tool for joint prostheses, comprising:
 
a curved tool head (2), the tool head having a passage (6) therethrough 

for receiving a prosthesis shaft; and
 
a locking device (8, 10, 12) to releasably block the prosthesis shaft 

within the passage, the locking device further comprising a blocking 
member (8) engaging the passage, characterized in that the blocking 

member (8) is adjustable by means of actuators (10, 12; 40) disposed 
within the tool head and axially displaceable within the tool head,
 
whereby an adjusting force acting upon the blocking member (8) is transmitted 

axially along the actuators. 
The knockout tool of claim 1, characterized in that the tool head (2) is 
smoothly curved and includes an axial longitudinal recess (14) opening 

into the passage, in which the actuators (10, 12; 40) and the blocking 
member (8) are disposed. 
The knockout tool of claim 2, characterized in that the actuators (10, 12) 

and the blocking member (8) are guided in opposed grooves (16) formed 
in the tool head (2). 
The knockout tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that one actuator (10) is connected to a lever (18) that acts to feed the 

blocking element (8) into a locking position and to releasably block the 
blocking element (8) in the locking position, wherein the inner actuator 

includes a pivot shaft (20). 
The knockout tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized  
 

in that the actuators include balls or rollers (40). 
The knockout tool according to one of the preceding claims further comprising 
an actuation rod (24, 62) connected to the tool head and a hammer 

element (26, 58) slidably mounted on the actuation rod. 
The knockout tool of claim 6, wherein an adjusting rod (28, 54) is slidably 
mounted in the actuation rod (24, 62) and is connected to the tool head 

(2) such that the adjusting force is brought to bear upon an outer actuator 
(12) of the tool head. 
The knockout tool of claim 7, wherein the adjusting rod simultaneously 
acts to adjust an engagement position of the blocking element (8) for 

adaptation to different shaft diameters of the prosthesis shaft and to lock 
the blocking element (8). 
The knockout tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that a lever member (56) is disposed on an end of the adjusting rod 

(54) and is operatively connected to the adjusting rod such that swivelling 
of the lever member (56) displaces the adjusting rod toward the tool 

head. 
The knockout tool of claim 9, wherein the lever member (56) is removable.
