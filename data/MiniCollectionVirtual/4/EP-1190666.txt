Valve for a dishwasher having a valve body (12), which encloses a cavity (13), an inlet (7) for a liquid feed into the cavity (13), a first outlet (15), which connects a first liquid pipe (9) to the cavity (13), a second outlet (16), which connects a second liquid pipe (10) to the cavity (13), wherein the first outlet (15) is arranged at least partly below the second outlet (16), a closure element (14) arranged to be movable in the cavity (13) and by means of which the first or the second outlet (15, 16) can be shut, and a flow-conducting device (18) arranged in the cavity (13) in the region of the inlet (7), 
characterised in that
 the closure element (14) behind the flow-conducting device (18) may occupy an intermediate position between the first and second outlet (15, 16), in which it is kept flow-free, so that liquid may emerge through both outlets.
Valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the flow-conducting device (18) is a flow divider.
Valve according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 at least one third outlet (17) is arranged between the first outlet (15) and second outlet (16).
Valve according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the third outlet (17) can be shut by the closure element (14).
Valve according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that
 the third outlet (17) with respect to the inlet (7) is arranged behind the flow-conducting device (18).
Valve according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by
 a guide device (19, 20) for guiding the closure element (14) between the first outlet (15) and the second outlet (16).
Valve according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the guide device (19, 20) with respect to the inlet (7) is arranged partly behind the flow-conducting device (18).
Valve according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that
 the guide device (19, 20) fixes the closure element (14) essentially on a guide line between the first and second outlet (15, 16).
Valve according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by
 a leakage-flow device, through which a reduced liquid flow can be introduced into the first liquid pipe (9) if the closure element (14) shuts the first outlet (15).
