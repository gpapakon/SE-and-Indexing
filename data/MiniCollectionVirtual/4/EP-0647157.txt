<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for regenerating acetylene hydrogenation catalysts, particularly palladium based catalysts which have been used to remove acetylenic contaminants from ethylene, which method does not require an oxygenation or other pretreatment step, comprises stripping the spent catalyst with hydrogen at 315-400  C and a linear hydrogen-containing gas velocity of at least 15.2 cm/second, to achieve substantially complete regeneration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
method for regenerating catalysts that have been used 
to remove acetylenic contaminants from olefin product 
streams. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to an improved method for regenerating 
palladium-containing catalysts that have been used to 
remove acetylenic contaminants from ethylene. Product streams of liquid or liquefiable olefins 
and diolefins typically are contaminated with small 
amounts of acetylenic impurities. For example, the 
ethylene/ethane fraction in an ethylene plant 
typically contains 0.5 - 2.0% acetylenic impurities. 
Such acetylenic contamination is undesirable because 
acetylene tends to poison the catalysts that are used 
to convert ethylene to polyethylene. Acetylene also 
can form metal acetylides which are explosive and 
which may contaminate the equipment that is used to 
process such product streams. It is known that acetylenic impurities can be 
selectively hydrogenated and thereby removed from such 
a product streams by passing the product stream over a 
catalyst (an "acetylene hydrogenation catalyst") in 
the presence of hydrogen; however, the hydrogenation 
process typically results in the deposition of a green 
oil on the catalyst which deactivates the catalyst.  
 
Therefore, acetylene hydrogenation processes typically 
include an oxygenation step or a "burn" step to remove 
the deactivating carbonaceous residues from the 
catalyst followed by a hydrogen reduction step to 
reactivate the catalyst. See, e.g., US-A-3,812,057 
(Morgan) and US-A-4,424,255 (Toyoda). An oxygenation step followed by hydrogen 
reduction normally is effective to regenerate an 
acetylene hydrogenation catalyst; however, there are 
many disadvantages to the use of an oxygenation step 
during regeneration of such catalysts. First, when oxygen and hydrogen come together 
under the conditions used to regenerate the catalyst, 
an exothermic reaction is produced which may result in 
uncontrolled temperature runaway. Thus, before the 
regeneration is performed, it is necessary to purge 
the catalyst of hydrogen and hydrocarbons using an 
inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, both before and after 
the oxygen-containing stream is introduced. The 
purging process is both tedious and time consuming. 
Furthermore, if the regeneration is performed in situ, 
the concentration of oxygen in the regeneration gas 
stream must be regulated carefully in order to avoid 
reactor temperature run-away. It would be 
advantageous if acetylene hydrogenation

<CLAIMS>
A method of substantially completely 
regenerating a catalyst that has been used to remove 

acetylenic impurities from an olefin stream and which 
has become at least partially deactivated by that use, 

which comprises substantially stripping the 
deactivated catalyst of carbonaceous deposits using 

hydrogen at a linear velocity of at least 15.2 
cm/second (0.5 feet per second), at a temperature of 

from 315 - 400°C (599 - 750°F) and at other conditions 
such that substantially complete regeneration is 

effected, wherein said stripping is essentially the 
only regeneration treatment employed and occurs in the 

absence of an oxygenation step. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the 
temperature is from 315 - 372°C (600 - 700°F), 

preferably about 350°C (662°F). 
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
hydrogen stripping employs a gas comprising an inert 

gas, preferably nitrogen, and from 5 to 10% of 
hydrogen. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein 
the catalyst comprises palladium, optionally together 

with another metal. 
The method of claim 4 wherein the palladium 
comprises from 0.01 to 0.5 wt%, preferably from 0.02 

to 0.05% of the catalyst.  
 
The method of any preceding claim wherein 
the catalyst has been used to remove acetylenic 

impurities from ethylene. 
The method of claim 6 wherein after 
regeneration the catalyst is used to remove acetylenic 

impurities from ethylene and the selectivity of the 
catalyst to ethylene is enhanced. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein 
the catalyst comprises a silica or alumina support.
