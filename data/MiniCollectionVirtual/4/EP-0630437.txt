<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement in a protective membrane (1; 101; 201), particularly for floors (11; 111; 211), comprising a substantially plane membrane of a preferably rigid material, e.g. plastic or similar, one side of the membrane (1A; 101A; 201A) having a large number of discrete protrusions or knobs (2A; 102A) preferably made by means of moulding, and the other side of the membrane (1B; 101B; 201B) having a corresponding number of indentations (2B; 102B; 202B) with substantially flat areas (4n; 104n) arranged among them and defining the main plane (3; 103) of the membrane, and for the purpose of providing a membrane which demonstrates good ergonometric properties when the floor is used, while at the same time the dampening of the noise of steps is optimized at the lowest possible level, it is suggested according to the invention that the arrangement comprises main area sectors (4n, 5n, 105n) and/or sectors with knobs (205n) which provide a combined yielding effect when subjected to loads and transfer of supporting capacity to other areas of the membrane (2BB; 102BB; 202BB).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement in a protective
membrane, especially for floors, comprising a substantially
plane membrane of a comparatively rigid material, for instance
plastic or similar, one side of the membrane having a large
number of separated protrusions or knobs, preferably resulting
from moulding, and the other side of the membrane having a
corresponding number of indentations among which are arranged
substantially flat areas which define the main plane of the
membrane.The applicant through his developments within the field of
protective membranes has provided several generations of the
said types of membrane. A first generation of foundation wall
membrane is known e.g. from US patent 3 888 087 (Bergsland),
while a second generation foundation wall membrane is described
in NO patent 148 041, corresponding to CA 1 186 470
(Bergsland).These protective membranes of first and second generations have
mainly been used as foundation wall membranes applied as a
cladding to the outer foundation wall of a house before back
fill is placed next to it. Such foundation wall membranes are
preferably manufactured with knobs which do not readily yield
due to the outside forces from e.g. backfilling.Recently it has also become usual for such foundation wall
membranes to be used as a vapour barrier for slab-on-ground,
and NO patent application 89 4899, corresponding to US
5.107.642 (Mogstad) describes the use of such membranes for the
protection of dwellings from penetration of fluids, especially
unpleasant or noxious gases. Similar membranes are also
described in applicant's US 5.044.821 (Johnsen). Available from the applicant are today systems based on the
above mentioned protective membranes, particularly for
protection from dampness of floors both with and without
mechanical ventilation, and especially Norwegian patent
application 89 4899 (US 5.107.642) describes a so-called radon
solution which preferably uses a protective membrane or a
foundation wall membrane with knobs, manufactured in accordance
with NO patent 148 041 (CA 1.186.470). (US 3 888 087).In connection with rehabilitation of basements and in connection
with houses with no basements, built on a so-called
slab-on-ground, there is a growing demand for a protective membrane
on the concrete foundation which may provide the necessary
protection, while at the same time constitute part of the
applicant's system for mechanical ventilation. Also in
connection with the construction of blocks of flats with floors
at different levels, it is
