<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing mating sintered parts obtained from breaking a unitary preform. It is characterised in that:   a) a preform is pressed from metal powders, making a superficial groove (3) in this preform, the groove being situated in a plane with a view to subsequent breakage, b) this preform is pre-sintered with a view to mechanically consolidating it, this preform nevertheless remaining fragile,   c) it is made denser, possibly by recompression, d) housings for the components for mechanically joining the final parts together are possibly machined in this preform,   e) this preform is broken into at least two parts,   f) final sintering is carried out,   g) the parts are cooled.   The invention is particularly applicable to the manufacture of connecting rods and connecting rod caps or of undercut or not undercut annular components (split in the axial plane).

Process for producing connected sintered metallic parts 
involving: 


a) pressing a preform from powdered metals while imprinting 
in it a superficial groove (3) located in a plane for the 

purpose of subsequent breakage, 
b) presintering this preform in order to consolidate it 
mechanically, the preform however remaining brittle, 
c) optionally compacting this preform by recompression, 
d) optionally machining recesses in this preform for the 
members for the mechanical connection of the final parts, 
e) breaking this presintered preform at ambient temperature 
into at least two parts, 
f) carrying out final sintering on these parts, 
g) cooling these parts. 
Process according to claim 1, in which the parts obtained 
in stage g) are mechanically connected. 
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the breakage in stage e) is obtained by bending. 
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the breakage in stage e) is obtained by tensile stress. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the radius of curvature (r) of the groove bottom (3) 

is smaller than 0.5 mm and preferably 0.2 mm.  
 
Process according to one of claims 4 or 5, characterised 
in that the elongation at break under tensile stress of the 

presintered preform b) is lower than 1%. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the groove is rectilinear. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the machining operations essentially involve 

perforation and tapping. 
Process according to one of claims 2 to 7 applied to the 
production of a connecting rod and connecting rod cover.
