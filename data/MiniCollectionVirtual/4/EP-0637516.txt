<ABSTRACT>
A printing sheet which is adapted for use in 
thermal transfer recording comprises a substrate (1) and 

a dye image-receiving layer (2) formed on the substrate. 
The layer (2) comprises an isocyanate group-containing 

polymer having at least one polysiloxane moiety and at 
least one urethane bond site therein. The isocyanate 

group-containing polymer is a reaction product between 
polyfunctional polyisocyanate compound and alcohol-modified 

silicone. A method for making such a sheet is 
also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printing sheet
which is adapted for use in thermal transfer printing
systems, particularly, a thermal transfer printing
system using sublimable dyes. More particularly, it
relates to a printing sheet which has both good sebum
resistance and good writeability and also to a method
for making the printing sheet.As is known in the art, there have been widely
used thermal transfer printing methods wherein an ink
ribbon is heated according to image information by use
of a thermal head or a laser beam to transfer, to a
print sheet, an ink from the ink ribbon by thermal
melting or diffusion or sublimation. In recent years,
attention has been paid to so-called sublimation-type
thermal transfer printing methods wherein full color
images with a continuous tone or gradation are formed
using thermally diffusable dyes such as sublimable dyes.
For instance, attempts have been made to form images on
a video printing sheet by selectively heating an ink
ribbon according to signals of video images. As a video image printing sheet, there is used a
sheet substrate such as of polypropylene and a dye
image-receiving layer formed on the substrate. The dye
image-receiving layer is able to receive the dye
transferred from an ink ribbon by heating and retains
the resultant image thereon. The image-receiving layer
has been conventionally made of resins which are
susceptible to dyeing with dyes. Such resins include
thermoplastic resins such as polyesters, polycarbonates,
polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride copolymers such as
vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyurethanes,
polystyrene, AS resins, ABS resins and the like.Recently, in order to enhance sensitivity enough
to form clear images and to improve the weatherability,
light fastness and thermal stability of images so that
once formed images can be stably kept, various attempts
have been made on resins for the dye image-receiving
layer. For instance, in order to improve the light
fastness and weatherability of images, there has been
proposed a dye image-receiving layer which is made
mainly of cellulose esters (United States Patent No.
5,278,130).However, as the thermal transfer printing
methods have been widespread, there is an increasing 
demand for satisfying the following characteristic
properties, not to mention the improvements in the
weatherability, light fastness and thermal stability.
More particularly, there is a demand for realizing a
printing sheet which has a good sebum resistance so that
when a dye-receiving layer on which images
