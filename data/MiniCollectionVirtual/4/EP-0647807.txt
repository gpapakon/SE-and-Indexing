<ABSTRACT>
A single control water mixing valve assembly which includes 
a fixed (52) and a movable (50) ceramic plate mounted within 

a housing in contact with one another and which serve to 
control the flow of water from hot and cold inlet ports to 

an outlet port. Linear and rotary movement is transmitted 
from a lever (18) through a bushing (46) to the movable 

plate (50) as the lever is turned on a radial axis within 
the bushing and rotated about the longitudinal axis of the 

lever. The fixed plate is spaced from the base and tubular 
resilient seals (60,62,64) are positioned in the space and 

firmly held in place within the space by radial ribs 
(66,68,70). The lever is received in a channel in the 

bushing with the sides of the lever adjacent to the sides of 
the channel, so that rotation of the lever about its 

longitudinal axis transmits torque to the bushing which, in 
turn, transmits the torque to the movable plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with a single control water
mixing valve of the general type described, for example, in
U S Patents 3,965,936 (which forms the basis for the preamble of claim 1; 4,738,281; and 5,095,934. The
mixing valve of the invention includes a fixed ceramic plate
and a moveable ceramic plate both mounted inside a plastic
housing and in contact with one another, and a lever coupled
to the movable plate for moving the movable plate linearly
and angularly with respect to the fixed plate.As described in U S Patent 4,738,281, water mixing
valves with plates formed of sintered alumina oxide
(ceramic) in mutual contact, are presently in wide use in
the field of sanitary ware. The ceramic plates very often
comprise duct elements communicating from one plate to
another so that the flow selection of hot and cold water is
made adjustable before mixing by positioning the two plates.
The usual prior art systems have a fixed ceramic plate and a
movable ceramic plate, whose relative position may be varied
by means of a single control in the form of a lever. The
lever is controlled by the user to adjust the mixed water
flow rate and also to adjust the ratio of the two water flow
rates in the mixture.The invention, which is defined in claim 1, provides an improved construction for a
self-lubricating ceramic plate mixing valve of the type
referred to above in which the lower end of the housing is
enclosed by a removable base member having an annular lip
and a bottom, and which has three ports in the bottom for
hot and cold water inlets and for a mixed water outlet,
respectively. A fixed ceramic plate is received in the
annular lip of the base in a spaced relationship with the
bottom, and three resilient tubular seals are received in
the base in the space between the bottom and the fixed 
ceramic plate. The tubular seals surround respective ones
of the three ports, and the base is compartmentalised to
cause the seals to be held securely in place during
operation of the valve.The outer face of the bottom of the base is recessed to
receive a disc-shaped gasket which serves to seal the
cartridge valve to the casing of the assembly, and also to
direct water from hot and cold water inlet tubes to the
corresponding hot and cold water inlet apertures in the
bottom of the base. Two types of gaskets are provided to
adapt the valve to alternate relative locations of the hot
and cold water supply tubes.A rotatable nylon bushing is included in the assembly
which receives the lever and which turns in the housing when
