<ABSTRACT>
The data processing station on the work surface of a dentist's patient treatment position, or on the work surface of other professions has, according to the invention, a frame (1) with the profile of a horizontal U, the upper limb (2) functioning as a standing surface for the monitor housing, the inside region of the U functioning as a region in which two pull-out drawers (8, 9) are located which serve to receive the work surface for the mouse and the rest for the keyboard, and the lower limb (3) functioning as a support for the double telescopic rail, for two slide rollers (5) and a felt mat (6) whose surface constitutes the axle region about which the station can be swivelled. It is thus possible for the equipment to be used for entering data alternately by two operators (e.g. dentist, dentist's assistant).
