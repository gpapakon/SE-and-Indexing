<ABSTRACT>
An enteral nutritional product has been formulated for persons who are 
currently undergoing radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. The nutritional 

product has a protein system which includes a soy protein hydrolysate. The 
nutritional product is very low in folic acid, contains β-carotene, and has 

a ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids that is in the range of about 1.3:1 to 
2.5:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an enteral nutritional product and a
method of providing nutritional support for persons who are currently
undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used, for example, for the
eradication of malignant cells present in the body, or for the treatment of
other diseases. When one considers the example of abdominopelvic carcinomas
treated with radiotherapy, pelvic radiation cannot kill malignant cells
without causing some damage to the surrounding normal tissues. The normal
tissue most often affected is the intestinal mucosa which, because of its
rapidly dividing cells, is very radiosensitive. This same phenomenon also
holds true for the use of chemotherapy in the eradication of malignant cells
located throughout the body, or the treatment of other diseases, when
treatment renders toxic trauma to the gastrointestinal tract. As an
example, although chemotherapy is effective in targeting the malignant
cells, or treating other diseases, its use is often associated with
significant damage to normal nonmalignant cells, such as those which line
the gastrointestinal tract. It is the failure to maintain homeostasis
between cell depletion (induction of apoptosis) and cell proliferation
(survival of pluripotent cells) with each successive dose of pelvic
radiation and/or chemotherapy that results in the clinically observed acute
gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms of both acute radiation/chemotherapy-induced
damage represent the expression of radiation/chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis and resultant functional changes in the bowel mucosa.
Morphological changes as a result of pelvic radiation-and/or chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis include, but are not limited to: (1) villi shortening; (2)
reduction in total epithelial surface area; (3) reduction or disappearance
of the glycocalyx and (4) loss of pluripotent cells.Functional changes in the small bowel, induced by pelvic irradiation
and/or chemotherapy include: malabsorption of fat, carbohydrate, protein,
and bile salts, and clinically presents as diarrhea. Symptoms of nausea,
vomiting and anorexia may also be experienced which results in a general
nutritional wasting which is reversible. If these symptoms continue, 
weight loss, dehydration and severe nutrient losses occur. Symptoms of
acute radiation/chemotherapy-induced enteritis usually abate shortly after
the completion of treatment. The segment of the small intestine most
affected by pelvic radiation is the ileum, and this is due to its

<CLAIMS>
An enteral nutritional product characterized by:

(a) a first source of protein comprising a soy protein
hydrolysate having a molecular weight partition, as

determined by size exclusion chromatography wherein 30-60%
of the particles have a molecular weight in the

range of 1500-5000 Daltons, the soy protein hydrolysate
comprising by weight not more than 90% of the protein

in the nutritional product;

and the intact protein in the nutritional product, the

intact protein comprising by weight at least 10% of the
protein in the nutritional product; and
(c) a source of fat characterized by the ratio, by weight,
of the sum of the n-6 fatty acids to the sum of the n-3

fatty acids being in the range of about 1.3:1 to 2.5:1;
said nutritional product containing less than 179.6 µg

of folic acid per liter.
