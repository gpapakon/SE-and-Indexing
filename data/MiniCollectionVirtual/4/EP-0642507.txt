<DESCRIPTION>
Within this application, publications are referenced by
arabic numerals within parentheses. Full citations for
these publications may be found at the end of each series
of experiments.Cocaine has been used by over 30,000,000 Americans since
1980 and frank addiction afflicts at least 1,700,000(1).
The medical and social consequences of this stimulant
abuse are well known and range from acute psychoses to
cardiac failure and from violent behavior to crack-addicted
newborns(2-4). Cocaine-induced disinhibition
and an increased propensity for high risk behavior now
pose a special peril with the advent of the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The highly reinforcing
nature of stimulants makes this form of substance abuse
especially pernicious and despite a variety of
pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches to
treatment, no modality is adequately successful(5,6).
The reinforcing potential is clearly related to peak
serum concentration(7-9). Also, the rapidity with which
the peak is achieved appears critical and may relate to 
the observation that tolerance to the psychopharmacologic
and physiologic effects of cocaine manifests during the
course of a single administration(10). The rampaging
abuse of crack, a smokeable form of cocaine, likely
corresponds in part to its rapid delivery across the lung
with an efficiency approaching that of an intravenous
injection(1,5). Pharmacokinetics may also explain the
propensity for binge use associated with crack
smoking(1). An agent that reduced the velocity to and
magnitude of peak serum levels would permit this
hypothesis to be tested as well as have major therapeutic
potential.The neuropharmacologic approach to treatment has focused
on receptor systems such as the dopaminergic pathways
that mediate the effects of cocaine(11). A direct
antagonist to cocaine is not available but agents such as
desipramine show some promise for maintaining
abstinence(12,13). However, there is a lag of several
weeks in the onset of desipramine's effect and during
this induction period a marked potential for recidivism
remains(5,14). An agent effective even for just this
period could have important clinical applications but at
present no such agent exists. An alternative to receptor
based approaches would be to interfere with the delivery
of cocaine to the central nervous system (CNS) so that a
dose of cocaine no longer had a reinforcing behavioral
effect. Since there is no prospect for excluding cocaine
from the circulation, this approach would require binding
of cocaine by a
