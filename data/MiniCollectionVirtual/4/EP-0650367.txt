<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOCKING INTERCELLULAR INTERACTIONS WITH CD43 CHIMERIC MOLECULES Background of the Invention This invention relates to methods of inhibiting cellular interactions, particularly interactions leading to inflammation or pathogenic infection.One important step in the generation of cellular immune responses is the adherence of lymphocytes to each other or to other cells of the immune system. Several molecular pathways for these cell-cell adhesive interactions have been defined (Springer, Nature 246:425- 434, 1990), and among lymphocytes, the binding of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) to its counterreceptor, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) (Rothlein, R. et al. , J. Immunol . , 137:1270-1274, 1986; Marlin, S.D. et al., Cell , 51:813-819, 1987) constitutes a dominant adhesion pathway. Antibodies that prevent interaction of these counterreceptors can block homotypic adhesion (Mentzer, S.J. et al. J. Immunol . , 135:9-11, 1985; Rothlein, R. et al., J. Exp. Med . , 163:1132-1149, 1986) and T-lymphocyte-mediated killing (Davignon, D. et al., J . Immunol . , 127:590-595, 1981; Sanchez-Madrid, F. et al., J. Exp. Med. , 158:1785-1803, 1983) , suggesting the importance of this adhesion pathway for normal immunity. Moreover, genetic deficiency of the β subunit of LFA-1 results in an immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent life-threatening bacterial infections and severe defects in adhesion-dependent leukocyte functions (Anderson, D.C. et al., J . Infect . Diε . , 152:668-689, 1985; Arnaout, M. A. et al., J. Clin . Invest . , 74:1291-1300, 1984; Ross, G.D. et al., Blood, 66:882-890, 1985) .Regulatory mechanisms that enhance LFA-1 binding to ICAM-l recently have been described (Dustin, M.L. et 

al., J. Cell Biol . , 107:321-331, 1988; Dustin, M.L. et al., Nature (London) , 341:619-624, 1989) and likely function to promote purposeful interactions between different types of lymphocytes as well as between lymphocytes and nonimmune cells. For example, lymphocyte binding to endothelium is augmented by preexposure of the endothelial cells to inflammatory cytokines, and the enhanced adhesion is due, in part, to a quantitative increase in ICAM-l expression by the endothelial cells (Dustin, M.L. et al., J. Cell Biol . , 107:321-331, 1988). Alternatively, activation of T lymphocytes by T-cell receptor crosslinking results in a marked but transient enhancement of lymphocyte LFA-1 avidity for ICAM-l, without increasing levels of LFA-1 expression (Dustin, M.L. et al., Nature (London) , 341:619-624,
