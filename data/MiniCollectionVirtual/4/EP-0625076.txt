<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus
for fluid distribution systems and, more particularly, to an
improved pulse irrigation system that is more adaptable to
varied needs and which, more uniformly, distributes
irrigating fluids with reduced fluid wastage.More specifically, this invention relates to an irrigation
system pilot valve according to the preamble of claim 1. Such an
irrigation system pilot valve is known from US-A-4 246 921.There is an unquestionable need for better
irrigation systems than those which are generally available
to the industry. For example, a typical system has a
manifold that is coupled to water supply. Each line is
connected to the manifold through a respective pilot valve.
Each of these lines comprise a set of elastic tubes, each of
the tubes being joined to the next tube in the series through
a combination diaphragm valve and discharge nozzle. The
elastic tubes expand slightly under hydraulic pressure as
they fill with irrigating water until the pressure at the end
of the line approaches the supply pressure. When that
pressure is reached, a pilot valve trips to stop the filling
and cause the individual diaphragm valves to block the
passageways to the manifold and open passageways to the
discharge nozzles in each of the diaphragm valves. The 
irrigating water is sprayed from the nozzles and, when
thewater stored under pressure in the communicating elastic
tubes is sufficiently depleted, the diaphragms in each of the
valves shift position in response to the header pressure to
block any further flow from the discharge nozzles and permit
the elastic tubes to fill once more in order to repeat the
cycle.This closed loop system, however, has a number of
serious deficiencies. The inherent limitations of this
system, for example, prevent its application to larger
installations. A ten acre orchard, for instance, would
require forty or fifty irrigating loops because the time
needed to fill each loop limits the number of emitters that
can be inserted in a loop to forty or fifty emitters.
Operation of each of these loops also must be synchronized
which is a burdensome task. Further, the proliferation of
these loops aggravates the problem of wasted pilot valve
discharge water. The quantity of fluid discharged from each
nozzle and uneven pressure distribution at these nozzles in
these systems, moreover, varies and thus fail to supply
uniform charges of irrigating water. This problem of
providing uniform charges of irrigating fluid is made even 
more difficult when the system is
