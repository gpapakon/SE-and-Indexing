<ABSTRACT>
A vaccine formulation comprising conjugates of detoxified LPS with proteins including cholera toxin (CT) is disclosed. Treatment with hydrazine (DeA-LPS) reduces the endotoxic properties of the LPS to clinically acceptable levels and results in a larger and more antigenic molecule than the saccharide produced by acid hydrolysis. The conjugates utilizing the cholera toxin of V. cholerae are disclosed which have low levels of pyrogen, no toxic activity upon Chinese hamster overay cells and elicit booster responses of vibriocidal and CT antibodies when injected subcutaneously as saline solutions into mice. The conjugates produced as a cholera vaccine induce the same antibodies as parenterally injected cellular vaccines but have improved safety and immunologic properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
ϋ Detoxified LPS-Cholera Toxin Conjugate Vaccine for Prevention of CholeraFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention disclosed herein relates broadly to the production of vaccines for the amelioration of 5 bacterial infections. More specifically, the invention describes the production of an antibacterial vaccine by conjugation of detoxified lipopolysaccharide derived from the bacterial target strain to proteins also produced by the bacteria target. 0 BACKGROUND ARTCholera persists as a cause of illness and death in at least 40 countries on 3 three continents: -340,000 cases have been reported in the Western hemisphere since an epidemic started in Peru, January 1991 [16,33]. 5 Worldwide prevention of cholera by immunization has not been achieved because of the limitations of available vaccines. Research into new vaccines is difficult because there is no consensus as to the moieties which best elicit a protective immune response. The absence of Q bacterial invasion, the systemic symptoms and the lack of intestinal inflammation characterizing the disease have led to the understanding that cholera is a toxin-mediated disease of the luminal surface of the jejeunum, and to the notion that a local intestinal response is required 5 for protective immunity [4,10-12,21,22,24,26,32,36,44]. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Vibrio cholerae is considered to be a protective antigen[3,18,22,36,38,43,51,60] but the structures, pathogenic role and host moieties involved in protective immunity to n cholera are incompletely understood. V. cholerae 01 LPS contains lipid A and a core oligosaccharide composed of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose, quinovosamine, D-glucose, D-fructose and heptose [23,30,47], 3-deoxy-D-manno octulosonic acid (KDO) has been identified recently and 5 presumed to be in the core adjacent to the lipid A [5]. 

The O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) of V. cholerae 0. serotype Inaba, contains a saccharide of -12 residues composed of l-»2-linked D-perosamine whose amino groups are acylated by 3-deoxy-L-glycero-tetronic acid [23,30,47]. The relationship between the sequence of the genes that encode the enzymes which synthesize the V. cholerae LPS and the serological specificity of the serotypes (LPS types) Inaba and Ogawa [23,36] has not been clarified.Parenterally administered cellular vaccines or partially purified LPS induce a statistically significant protection against cholera in adults (-60%) for -6 months [3,7,18,22,38,45]. Cellular vaccines are less effective for infants and young children and ineffective for
