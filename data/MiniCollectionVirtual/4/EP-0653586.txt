<ABSTRACT>
A LED module 10 for providing a source of illumination 
comprises a plurality of LED lamps 18 each having an 

anode lead 24 and a cathode lead 26 for providing 
electrical and mechanical connection. The anode lead of 

each LED lamp is connected to an anode bus bar 28 and 
the cathode lead of each LED lamp is connected to a 

cathode bus bar 30 by solderless connection 34 and 36. 
The bus bars and the leads of each LED lamp may be 

integral with each other. Alternatively, the bus bars 
and leads may be non-integral withn each other, 

connected by an interlocking interaction or interference 
fit between approximately complementary portions of each 

lead and bus bar. The LED module may accommodate serial 
electrical interconnection with other LED modules, it 

may be shaped according to the particuLar contour or 
design of an accommodating light assembly, and it may 

comprise LED lamps placed at arbitrary positions to 
achieve a predetermined degree of illumination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device comprising a
multiplicity of light emitting diodes for providing a
source of illumination such as for the exterior portion of
an automobile.Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are a type of
semiconductor device that emit a visible light when biased
in the forward direction. Lamps incorporating such LEDs
as their light source are referred to as LED lamps. Due
to their construction, LED lamps are typically smaller
than standard bulb or filament type lamps, making their
use particularly desirable in applications where a premium
is placed on space, such as cameras, watches, computers,
computer printers and numerous other compact devices.
Additionally, the LED is energy efficient in that it only
requires a small amount of electricity in order to
generate a relatively strong light. Therefore, the LED is
a particularly desirable lighting source in applications
where energy efficiency is important, such as with battery
powered portable devices.Generally speaking, although LED lamps offer a
relatively high degree of illumination for their size, LED
lamps must usually be combined with other LED lamps in
order to achieve the same degree of illumination as a
light assembly illuminated by standard bulb type lamps. 
However, the combination of LED lamps typically occupy
less space and require less energy to operate than that of
the standard bulb type lamps they replace. The space
saving and energy efficient features of the LED make it a
popular choice with designers and manufacturers who are
motivated to reduce the size and/or increase the
efficiency of the light source used in their products.Recently, LED lamps have found application in the
automobile industry as a source of illumination, replacing
standard bulb type lamps, for exterior lights, such as
parking lights, brake lights and the like. It is highly
desirable that the light source used in the automobile be
energy efficient. The LED is a popular choice in such an
application because its use permits the replacement of
standard bulb type lamps that require a larger space and
consume a greater amount of energy to operate. The space
savings that results from replacing standard bulb type
lamps with the LED in such an application may be better
put to use in the form of added passenger or storage
capacity. Size savings can translate into weight savings
as well, an important factor in fuel economy.The standard bulb type lamps are known to have a high
rate of failure when used in an automotive application.
The high failure rate is
