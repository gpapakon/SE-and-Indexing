<ABSTRACT>
Pulses of ultrasound are focused in a patient's 
body to create an interrogation volume where either the 

magnitude of velocity or the direction of blood flow is 
to be measured. The strength of the back-scattered 

signal is measured for each pulse and the mean squared 
rate of change of the envelope of the range-gated signal 

is estimated. In order to measure flow velocity 
independent of direction, the interrogation volume is 

generated substantially as a sphere by creating an 
ultrasonic wave envelope in which the components of the 

mean square spatial gradient are equal in all 
directions. The estimated mean square rate of change of 

the envelope of the back-scattered signal is then scaled 
to provide a direction-independent measurement of flow 

velocity. In order to determine the direction of flow, 
the interrogation volume is generated substantially as 

an ellipsoid. The long axis of the ellipsoidal 
interrogation volume is then rotated until the measured 

mean square rate of change of the envelope of the return 
signal is at a minimum, which is reached when the long 

axis is aligned with the flow direction. The 
interrogation volume is preferably rotated and 

translated using differential phasing of the ultrasonic 

signals from different transducer elements (62a, ..., 
62e; 71(1,1), ..., 71(20, 20)) in a two-dimensional 

phased array.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves a method for using ultrasound 
to sense the speed and direction of flow of a fluid, such 
as blood in a coronary artery. The measurement of blood flow in the coronary 
arteries is a well-known technique for diagnosing coronary 
artery diseases. There are, consequently, many different 
devices and methods for determining this blood flow. One common sensing technique involves the use of 
ultrasound. Using this technique, ultrasound is directed 
into the body of the patient and tiny particles such as 
red blood cells, which are suspended in the blood, scatter 
the ultrasonic energy back towards the transducer. The 
transducer then converts the back-scattered ultrasonic 
energy into an electrical signal that is processed in some 
known manner to determine an estimate of the flow. One great advantage of ultrasonic sensing is that it 
is non-invasive, meaning that it can be carried out 
without having to cut or insert anything into the 
patient's body. A problem one faces when using existing 
ultrasonic flow measurement techniques, however, is that 
measurements are often made through the "keyhole" between 
the ribs in a transthoracic scan, where the coronary 
arteries typically twist over the curved surface of the 
moving heart wall. The direction of the blood in the 
arteries or the motion of the heart wall with respect to 
the line-of-sight of the ultrasonic beam is therefore 
usually not known. This is a serious problem for the many 
common techniques that use the principle of Doppler shift.  The Doppler principle used in existing techniques for 
calculating flow velocity v based on the frequency shift 
of ultrasonic waves scattered by moving red cells can be 
expressed as follows: 
fd=2(vc)f₀·cosϑ , in which f₀ is the frequency of the ultrasonic wave sent 
into the body, v is the flow velocity, c is the speed of 
sound, ϑ is the angle between the line-of-sight direction 
of the beam and the flow, and fd is the detected frequency 
shift of the signal that returns to the transducer. As 
long as cos ϑ is not equal to zero, the frequency shift 
will increase with increasing flow velocity. As the equation shows, it is not possible using 
conventional Doppler techniques to detect any frequency 
shift if ϑ equals 90°, that is, if the flow is 
perpendicular to the line-of-sight of the ultrasonic 
transducer, regardless of how fast the blood is flowing. 
Police officers who use radar guns to check for speeders 
are a more common example of this problem: the officers 
cannot position

vessel or organ comprising the following steps: 


A. repeatedly applying to each of a plurality of 
piezoelectric transducer elements (62a, ..., 62e; 71(1,1),
