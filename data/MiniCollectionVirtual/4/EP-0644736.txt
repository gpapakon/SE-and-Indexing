<ABSTRACT>
A system (10) for direct visualization of the spine includes a catheter (12) and a fiber-optic bundle (20) disposed within the catheter (12) which is connected to a light source and camera. The optical bundle is connected (26) to the proximal end of the catheter to permit rotation of the bundle relative thereto. A mechanism for deflecting the catheter tip provides a conical viewing angle (13) for the fiber-optic bundle and assists in steering the catheter through the spinal space. The mechanism includes a deflection wire (57) extending through the catheter and affixed at the distal end (83) thereof. The proximal end of the deflection wire is affixed to a sleeve (58) slidably disposed around the catheter to contact a stop surface (59) as the catheter and deflection wire are moved. The stop surface prevents further movement of the catheter causing tension in the wire between the sleeve and the wire's securement to the catheter, thereby bending the catheter tip in the direction of the securement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for use in
visualization of the spine in vivo for diagnosis and
treatment. More particularly, the invention concerns a
flexible endoscope having a deflecting tip for changing the
viewing angle of a removable fiber-optic bundle and for
providing a means for steering the endoscope through tight
spaces.Low back pain syndrome represents a major health problem
in the United States. In recent years, practitioners in the
spinal field have sought methods to minimize the invasive
nature of diagnosis and treatment of the causes of low back
pain syndrome. Surgeons and other practitioners in the field
have also sought ways to minimize the invasive nature of
other more serious spinal surgery such as reducing vertebral
fractures, implanting prosthetic vertebrae or implanting
spinal fixation devices.Typically, spinal diagnosis and treatment is conducted
under indirect visualization techniques, such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), catscan (CT) and more frequently,
fluoroscopic X-ray or radiographic monitoring using a C-arm
image intensifier. Direct visualization of specific affected
regions of the spine can be obtained through surgical
incisions through the skin and fat layer. Less invasive
percutaneous techniques, such as suggested by Jacobsen in
U.S. Patent No. 4,545,374 or by Kambin in U.S. Patent No.
4,573,448, are thus far typically performed under indirect 
visualization. There remains a need therefore, for a means for direct visualization of the
spinal column, including the vertebrae, disc tissue and the epidural and intra-discal spaces,
without extensive surgery.Visualization of the spine carries with it significant difficulties over visualization of
other body regions, such as the knee. Direct visualization of the knee has been readily
accomplished using rigid arthroscopes, since there is very little requirement for guiding or
steering the fiber-optic bundle through this joint.U.S. Patent No. 3,941,121 discloses a rigid endoscope comprising a needle inside
which a fiber-optic bundle for transmitting images is disposed. A series of illuminating
fiber-optics are provided within the needle, and a hollow tube is provided to allow the
introduction of fluid at a distal end of the needle. The needle is dimensioned such that it is
suitable for insertion through a lumbar puncture needle, to allow inspection of nerve
pathways within the spinal column.However, the spinal column consists of several joints, and moreover, the
configuration of the vertebrae themselves hamper the
