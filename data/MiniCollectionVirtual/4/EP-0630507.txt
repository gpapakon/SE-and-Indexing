<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the handling of mixed denominations of 
coins, and particularly to an improved coin sorter that is simple in construction 
and operation. A common form of coin sorter is the rail sorter in which coins of 
mixed denominations are fed in a single file and in a single layer to the 
entrance to a track defined on one side by a rail against which the coins are 
referenced. The coins in the single file move along the track and past 
openings of increasing size. The openings are sized for each of the respective 
diameters of the coins in the mix. As the coins move past an opening, 
coins of the size of that opening will pass through the opening and 
drop into a chute that leads to a point of collection. The coins are counted 
by sensors either as they move along the track or as they move through 
the openings. A rail sorter can be designed to distinguish between coins whose diameters 
differ by only a slight amount. As a result, a rail sorter is very 
useful in dealing with coinage in which the diameters of different denominations 
are close to each other and also for coinage in which there are a 
large number of different sizes of coins. In the simplest form of a rail sorter, the coins are moved along the 
track under the effect of gravity. An example of this simple form is 
shown in U. S. patent 454,653 issued June 23, 1891 to Kirkmeyer. The use 
of gravity requires that the track be inclined. Where a horizontal track is 
desired or where a greater speed of coin processing is desired, the coins 
may be physically moved along the track usually by one or more driven 
endless belts. Examples of this form are shown in U. S. patents 4,072,156 
issued February 7, 1978 to Abe; 4,271,855 issued June 9, 1981 to Ueda; and 
4,657,035 issued April 14, 1987 to Zimmermann. Driven endless belts 
have also been used in conjunction with inclined tracks as exemplified by 
U. S. patent 2,101,513 issued December 7, 1937 to Samuelsen, et al. A variation of the rail sorter arranges the track in a circle rather 
than in a straight line. An example of this variation is found in U. S. 
patent 3,771,538 issued November 13, 1973 to Reis. In the Reis patent,  
 
coins are deposited on the top surface of a rotating hard 
disc that forms the bottom of a hopper. The coins are moved 
by centrifugal force through an opening in a wall of the 
hopper to align the coins in a single file and in a single 
layer at the circumference of the rotating hard disc. The 
single file of coins passes through a tangential passage
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A coin sorter including a first rotatable disc (12) having an 
upper surface (13) upon which coins may be deposited, a 

stationary sorter plate (20) to one side of the first 
rotatable disc (12) and having a generally circular sorting 

track (30) that begins at a point adjacent to the perimeter 
of the first rotatable disc (12), said track including a 

plurality of sorting stations (31a-31f), and a second rotatable 
disc (25) having a resilient underside disposed in close 

proximity to the upper surface (21) of the sorter plate (20), 
characterized in that the track (30) has an upper surface 

that is in the same plane as the upper surface of the 
first rotatable disk (12); and the resilient underside 

engages coins that are on the first rotatable disc to 
move the coins from the first rotatable disc onto the 

sorter plate (20) and to move the coins along the track (30) to 
the sorting stations (31a-31f). 
A coin sorter according to claim 1, characterized by a 
hopper (10), the first rotatable disc (12) forming the bottom of 

the hopper (10). 
A coin sorter according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the second rotatable disc (25) partially overlays the 

first rotatable disc (12), and the second rotatable disc (25) 
includes an array of depending flexible fingers (27), the 

flexible fingers (27) being spaced from each other adjacent 
the perimeter of the second rotatable disc and each 

finger extends in a radial direction from the center of 
the second disc.  

 
A coin sorter according to claim 3, characterized in 
that each finger (27) has a radially outer end having an 

inwardly tapered portion leading to an upright portion 
adjacent to the top surfaces of the first rotatable disc (12) 

and sorter plate (20). 
A coin sorter according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sorting track includes an upright rail forming 

an outer reference edge (30) against which coins are disposed 
as they are moved along the track and the rail comprises 

an upright ribbon of spring steel disposed in a 
cooperating groove (32) on the outside of the track and held 

in place by cushioning means (33) so that the rail will yield 
upon impact by coins. 
A coin sorter according to claim 1, characterized by a 
motor (45) and a single belt (46) connecting the motor shaft to 

both rotatable discs. 
A coin sorter according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the belt (46) extends from the motor shaft and around a 

drum (24) mounting the second rotatable disc, and a return 
run (46') of the belt engages the perimeter of a circular 

flange (14) connected to the first rotatable disc (12). 
A coin sorter according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the first rotatable disc (12) includes a raised portion 

having an outer edge spaced inwardly from the hopper and 
at a height which is less than twice the thickness of 

the thinnest denomination of coin to be handled. 
A coin sorter according to claim 8, characterized by a 
deflector plate (40) extending from the inside of the hopper 

and over the first rotatable disc in the path of coins  
 

on the first disc (12) in advance of the second rotatable 
disc (25), the deflector plate (40) having an end (41) that is spaced 

from the outer edge of the raised portion a distance 
that is less than twice the diameter of the smallest 

coin to be sorted. 
A coin sorter according to claim 3, characterized by a 
driven roller (50) disposed adjacent the perimeter of the 

first rotatable disc (12) before the overlap of the first 
disc (12) and the second rotatable disc (25), the roller (50) having 

its perimeter spaced above the top surface of the first 
disc a distance less than the thinnest coin to be sorted 

and being driven in a direction opposing the movement of 
the first disc. 
A coin sorter according to claim 3, characterized by a 
driven roller (51) disposed adjacent the perimeter of the 

first rotatable disc (12) and following the overlap of the 
first disc (12) and the second rotatable disc (25), the roller (51) 

being driven in a direction that is the same as the 
movement of the first disc. 
A coin sorter according to claim 8, characterized by a 
flexible deflector plate (40) extending from the inside of 

the hopper toward the edge of the raised portion in 
advance of the second rotatable disc, said deflector 

plate terminating at a distance from the edge that is 
less than twice the diameter of the smallest coin to be 

sorted.
