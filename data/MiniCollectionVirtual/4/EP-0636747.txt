<ABSTRACT>
A procedure for the controlled transformation and 
application of fibres in situ in civil and road 

constructions, characterized essentially in that in 
principle a continuous band 1 is unwound from a ball of 

raw material 2, said band entering a turret 3 which 
absorbs any overtensions and distensions produced as the 

fibre is unwound and which is provided with a knot 
detector 13 which brings the entire process to a halt if 

any irregularity in the strand of material is located, 
the band of material, now at a constant tension, then 

entering a cutting station 6 consisting of a cylinder 
provided on its peripheral edge with a plurality of 

blades and over which the band of material winds such 
that two effects are produced, the first of these being 

one of traction by friction whilst the blades and fibres 
are in contact and the second comprising the final 

cutting of the fibre. Finally, once cut into segments of 
a convenient length, the fibre is conveyed to the mixing 

station 7 by means of an articulated tube 8 through 
which the material runs, driven pneumatically by an 

impulsion gang 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention comprises a
procedure for the controlled in situ transformation and
application of fibres in civil and road
constructions.These fibres are manufactured in large fibre-producing
plants which are remote from the construction
sites and mixing stations, and from where they are
served in bags, the form in which they arrive there.
Once there, the mixture is made manually in the mixing
station by one or more operators who constantly feed the
station from the bags of manufactured fibres or by
pouring them manually into dispensing devices.This method of working has a significant drawback
in that operators have to be used permanently for the
job of feeding the fibres, said operators, as competent
as they might be, never achieving a totally homogeneous
product, and furthermore the manufacture of the raw
fibre in factories which are remote from the
construction site implies a lack of control over the
product for those responsible since they find themselves
having to place orders according to the current stocks
and the standard sizes of fibres used by said stations.The present invention as defined in claim 1 substantially improves the
procedures for the incorporation of fibres in road and
civil construction stations which are currently used. In particular, said procedure enables the fibre to
be manufactured on site, personalizing its properties
according to the requirements at every moment such that
it is possible to vary said properties at any time in an
exceptionally simple way. Furthermore, it makes it
possible to continuously feed the mixing station
automatically without the intervention of any
personnel, ensuring a perfectly homogeneous product at
all times.There is an accompanying drawing to illustrate the
procedure of the present invention.The novel procedure for the controlled
transformation and application of fibres in civil and
road constructions comprises three phases. The first of
these consists of unwinding the ball of raw fibre to
produce a continuous strand or sheet of material of
uniform tension. The second phase consists of cutting
the band of material into segments of a certain length
depending on the properties of the material with which
said segments are to be mixed. The third phase consists
of transportation to the mixing station and dispensing
the product in the volume required.In the first phase, a continuous band 1 unwound
from a ball of raw material 2 enters a turret 3 by means
of a foot with an input guide 4, said guide being
provided with a plurality of

<CLAIMS>
A procedure for the controlled in situ transformation
and application of fibres in civil and road

constructions, characterized in that a
continuous band (1) is unwound from a ball of raw material

(2), said band enters a turret (3) which absorbs any
overtensions and distensions produced as the fibre is

unwound and which is provided with a knot detector (13)
which brings the entire process to a halt if any

irregularity in the strand of material is located, the
band of material, now at a constant tension, then

enters a cutting station (6) consisting of a cylinder
provided with a plurality of

blades on its peripheral edge and over which cylinder the band of material winds such
that two effects are produced, the first of these being

one of traction by friction whilst the blades and fibres
are in contact, and the second comprising the final

cutting of the fibre which, once cut into segments of a
convenient length, is finally conveyed to the mixing

station (7) by means of an articulated tube (8) through
which the material runs, driven pneumatically by an

impulsion gang (10).
A procedure for the controlled transformation
and application of fibres in situ in civil and road

constructions according to the previous claim,
characterized in that the length of the segments of

fibre cut is determined as a function of the distance
between the blades situated on the cylinder, the

production volume being determined by regulating the

speed of rotation of said blade-carrying cylinder and
the tension at which the continuous strand of fibre is

supplied, said strand being of constant weight along its
entire length. 
A procedure for the controlled transformation
and application of fibres in situ in civil and road

constructions according to the previous claims,
characterized in that the dispensing of the amount of

fibres poured into the mixing station is determined by
means of the cutting speed and the pneumatic pressure

maintained inside the tube, said pressure being in
accordance with the volume of the product delivered by

the cutting station.
A procedure for the controlled transformation
and application of fibres in situ in civil and road

constructions according to the previous claims,
characterized in that all the mechanical elements are

situated on a travelling platform (11) which is also
provided with a transportable control panel (12) for

controlling the entire process.
