<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical component
available for use in the field of optical communication,
optical signal processing and the like, and particularly to
an optical branching device or branch waveguide.In the fields of optical communication and,optical
signal processing, waveguide type optical branching devices
are often utilized responding to demands for
miniaturization of optical components. A representative
optical branching device is described in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. HEI 5-11130 (11130/1993). Also,
directional coupler is described in Journal of Lightwave
Technology 10(2): 1843-1849, December 1992.Conventional optical branching devices have no
satisfactory small insertion loss. The optical branching
device of the present invention has adequate processing
stability, and further offers a lowered loss at the
branching section. The optical branching device according to the present
invention comprises a substrate; a cladding member disposed on
said substrate; a first waveguide embedded in said cladding member and having an optical axis and
an end face, said end face being simultaneously substantially
perpendicular to said optical axis and to an interface between
said substrate and said cladding member; and second and third
waveguides embedded in said cladding member; said second and
third waveguides being separated from one another, and each of
said second and third waveguides tapering toward and
contacting directly said end face of the first waveguide.In the above defined optical branching device said first
waveguide lowers the energy density of light to be input
thereinto and makes the wave front of said light parallel to
said end face of said first waveguide.The present invention can also be on optical component
comprising a plurality of the optical branching device. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an optical branching
