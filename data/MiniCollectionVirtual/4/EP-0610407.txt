<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shampoo compositions containing 
hair conditioning ingredients. Human hair becomes soiled due to its contact with the 
surrounding atmosphere and, to a greater extent, from sebum 
secreted by the head. The build-up of the sebum causes the hair 
to have a dirty feel and an unattractive appearance. The soiling 
of the hair necessitates it being shampooed with frequent 
regularity. Shampooing the hair cleans by removing excess soil and sebum. 
However, the shampooing process has disadvantages in that the hair 
is left in a wet, tangled and generally unmanageable state. 
Shampooing can also result in the hair becoming dry or "frizzy", 
and a loss of luster, due to removal of natural oils or other hair 
moisturizing materials. After shampooing, the hair can also 
suffer from a loss of "softness" perceived by the user upon 
drying. The hair can also suffer from increased levels of static 
upon drying after shampooing. This can interfere with combing and 
can result in fly-away hair. A variety of approaches have been 
developed to alleviate the after-shampoo problems. These range 
from the inclusion of hair conditioning aids in shampoos to 
post-shampoo application of hair conditioners, i.e., hair rinses. 
Hair rinses are generally liquid in nature and must be applied in 
a separate step following the shampooing, left on the hair for a 
length of time, and rinsed with fresh water. This, of course, is 
time consuming and is not as convenient as shampoos containing 
both cleaning and hair conditioning ingredients. While a wide variety of shampoos have been disclosed which 
contain conditioning aids, they have not been totally satisfactory  
 
for a variety of reasons. Cationic conditioning agents are highly 
desirable for use in hair conditioning due to their abilities to 
control static, improve wet detangling, and provide a silky wet 
hair feel to the user. One problem which has been encountered in 
shampoos relates to compatibility problems between good cleaning 
anionic surfactants and the many conventional cationic agents 
which historically have been used as conditioning agents. Efforts 
have been made to minimize adverse interaction through the use of 
alternate surfactants and improved cationic conditioning agents. 
Cationic surfactants which provide good overall conditioning in 
hair rinse products, in general, tend to complex with anionic 
cleaning surfactants and provide poor conditioning in a shampoo 
context. In particular, the use of soluble cationic surfactants 
that form

<CLAIMS>
A hair conditioning shampoo composition characterized in 
that it comprises: 


(a) from 5% to 50%, by weight, of an anionic surfactant 
component selected from the group consisting of anionic 

surfactants and amphoteric surfactants that are anionic
