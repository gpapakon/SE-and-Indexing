<ABSTRACT>
Lock comprising a locking control member (1) mounted to slide under the action of a driving element (15) controlled in rotation by a key cooperating with a security member. The driving element (15) is housed with an angular clearance (14) in the radial slot of an externally stepped ring (11, 12). The control member includes a longitudinal cut out portion forming two terminal shoulders (6, 7). A tooth (10) is disposed centrally between said shoulders (6, 7) so that the latter (6, 7) and the tooth (10) form a rack portion cooperating with the angular clearance space (14) formed by the driving device (15) housed in the radial slot of the stepped ring (11, 12) and with the slot edges. Application to locks.

Lock including a locking control member, such as a bolt 
(1), or a slide (30) controlling at least one bolt, the said 

control member (1, 30) being mounted so as to slide under the 
action of a catch (15) controlled with respect to rotation by 

a key or integral with the said key, the rotation of the said 
key being allowed by its cooperation with a security member 

such as a barrel, a profiled cylinder (16) or a sleeve,
 
characterised in that 


the said catch (15) is housed, with angular clearance (14), 
in a radial slot (13) in a ring (11, 12) which is stepped on 

the outside and mounted so as to rotate freely, coaxially with 
the axis of rotation of the said catch (15), 
the said locking control member (1, 30) has a substantially 
rectangular longitudinal cutout (5) forming two end shoulders 

(6, 7), 
a tooth (10) is disposed centrally between the two shoulders 
(6, 7) and its width is less than the clearance (14) of the 

catch (15) in the slot (13) in the ring (11, 12), 
the height of the said tooth (10) is greater than the 
thickness of the region (8, 9) of the control device (1, 30) 

surrounding the said cutout (5), 
the end of the said tooth (10) is recessed with respect to 
the edge (4) of the locking control member (1, 30) where the 

longitudinal cutout (5) is formed, 
the said region (8, 9) surrounding the cutout (5) is 
disposed opposite the step (12) on the said ring (11, 12), 
  
 

so that the shoulders (6, 7) in the cutout (5) and the tooth 
(10) form a rack portion cooperating with an angular space 

forming a clearance (14) for the said catch (15) in the radial 
slot in the stepped ring (11, 12) and with the edges of the 

said slot (13). 
Lock according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said 
central tooth (10) is provided with two symmetrical end 

bevels. 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the rack portion (6, 7, 10) is formed in a bar thickness 

(1) forming thin end edges (8, 9) and a central tooth (10) 
occupying the entire thickness of the bar (1). 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the rack portion (6, 7, 10) is formed by a thin region 

cut out and deformed in such a way that the shoulders (6, 7) 
in the cutout (5) and the tooth (10) are in different planes. 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the rack portion (6, 7, 10) is formed on a piece (40) 

attached to the locking control member (30). 
Lock according to Claim 5, characterised in that the said 
attached piece (40) is mounted with a limited longitudinal 

sliding on the said locking control member (30). 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the locking control member is a bolt (1) and the said 

rack portion (6, 7, 10) is disposed parallel to the direction 
of sliding of the bolt (1). 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that a lever (17) controlling a half-turn bolt (22) is 

articulated (18) on the plate (3) of the lock and its free end 
(19) is disposed on the path of the catch (15).  

 
Lock according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the locking control member consists of a sliding plate 

(30), one longitudinal edge of which includes the said rack 
portion (6, 7, 10), the said plate (30) controlling at least 

one locking linkage (34, 35) moving parallel to the movement 
of the said plate (30), the said plate (30) having a slot (31) 

or groove guiding a stud (32) fixed to a bolt (32) moving 
perpendicularly to the movement of the said plate (30). 
Lock according to Claim 9, characterised in that the said 
plate (30) is arranged to close off, at least partially, the 

opening through which a half-turn bolt (36) passes in the 
position of locking of the lock. 
Lock according to Claim 10, characterised in that the 
retraction of the half-turn bolt (38) is controlled by a cam 

(38) fixed to a lever (44) pivoted by the sliding of the said 
plate (30). 
Lock according to one of Claims 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11, 
characterised in that the locking control member (30) is 

articulated (43) at one end of a pivoting lever (44) 
controlled by a handle (23) controlling a half-turn bolt (36).
