Spindle for manufacturing a yarn or twisted thread with a 
spindle rotor which has a thread-guiding channel, 

beginning substantially in the region of the spindle 
shaft and directed radially outwards, for a thread (F1) 

which, on emerging from the thread-guiding channel, is 
guided onwards forming a balloon to a centering point (Z) 

lying in the extension of the axis of the spindle rotor, 
and with a device for introducing a flowable medium (M1) 

in substantially axial direction into the space defined by 
the balloon of thread, whereby the flowable medium (M1 - 

M5) is supplied by a supply pipe (3) which, at least in 
one section immediately before an outlet opening (3.3), 

runs coaxially or parallel to the axis (A) of the spindle 
rotor, and at least the last part (3.2) of this section 

is arranged so as to rotate around the axis of the 
spindle rotor and contains a thread-guiding pipe (4), one 

end (4.1) of which is guided out coaxially from this part 
(3.2) and the other end (4.2) of which is guided out 

substantially radially from this part (3.2), 
characterized in that the pipe (3) is located above the 

spindle and one end (4.1) of the thread-guiding pipe (4) 
is guided out coaxially in direction of the centering 

point (Z), whilst the thread (F1) emerging from the 
balloon of thread is supplied to the other end (4.2). 
Spindle according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
rotating part (3.2) can be driven by way of a driving 

device (10, 11). 
Spindle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the outlet opening (3.3) of the pipe (3) is widened so as 

to take the form of a funnel (3.4). 
Spindle according to one of Claims 1 - 3, characterized 
in that, with a two-for-one twisting spindle, a cover  

 
(12) is located between the outlet opening (3.3) of the 

pipe (3) and the inlet opening of the thread inlet pipe 
(2) of the twisting spindle. 
Spindle for manufacturing a yarn or twisted thread (F4 - 
F7) with a spindle rotor (15, 25, 35, 45) which has a 

thread-guiding channel (14.2, 24.2, 34.2, 44.2), 
beginning substantially in the region of the spindle 

shaft and directed radially outwards, for a thread which, 
on emerging from the thread-guiding channel, is guided 

onwards forming a balloon to a centering point lying 
in the extension of the axis of the spindle rotor, and 

with a device for introducing a flowable medium (M2 - M5) 
in substantially axial direction into the space defined 

by the balloon of thread, whereby the flowable medium 
(M2 - M5) is supplied by a supply pipe (13, 23, 33, 43) 

which, at least in one section immediately before an 
outlet opening (13.3, 23.3, 33.3, 43.3), runs coaxially 

or parallel to the axis (A) of the spindle rotor, and at 
least the last part (13.2, 23.2, 33.2, 43.2) of this 

section is arranged so as to rotate around the axis of 
the spindle rotor and contains a thread-guiding pipe (14, 

24, 34, 44), the upper end (14.1, 24.1, 34.1, 44.1) of 
which is guided out coaxially from this part (13.2, 23.2, 

33.2, 43.2) and the other end (14.2, 24.2, 34.2, 44.2) of 
which is guided out substantially radially from this part 

(13.2, 23.2, 33.2, 43.2), and characterized in that the 
supply pipe (13, 23, 33, 43) is guided from below through 

the axis (A) of the spindle rotor (15, 25, 35, 45). 
Spindle according to Claim 5, characterized in that, with 
a two-for-one twisting spindle, the outlet opening of the 

pipe (13) guided coaxially through the spindle rotor (15) 
lies opposite a distributor piece (21), which is firmly
 
connected with the bobbin carrier base (19.1) of the 

spindle and bears the hollow spindle shaft (22), the 
coaxial end of the thread-guiding pipe (14) being guided  

 
through said distributor piece (21) so as to rotate and 

the distributor piece having outlet openings (21.1, 21.2) 
running in substantially radial direction. 
Spindle according to Claim 5, characterized in that, with 
a two-for-one twisting spindle, the outlet opening (23.3) 

of the pipe (23), running eccentrically to the axis (A) of 
the spindle rotor in the section (23.2) containing the 

thread-guiding pipe (24), is arranged aligned substantially 
radially in a rotating head piece (25.1) guided into the 

bobbin carrier (19), whereby the foot section (31) of the 
hollow spindle shaft (32), held fast against the protective 

pot (29) by locking devices (28.1, 28.2), is supported on 
this head-piece (25.1) by way of a pivot bearing (30.2). 
Spindle according to Claim 5, characterized in that, with 
a two-for-one twisting spindle, both the section (33.2) of 

the pipe bearing the axially aligned outlet opening (33.3) 
of the pipe (33) guided coaxially through the spindle 

rotor (35) and the coaxial end of the thread-guiding pipe 
(34) are guided through the base (39.1) of the bobbin 

carrier (39) so as to rotate, and the presentation bobbin 
(54) is suspended in the upper section (39.2) of the 

bobbin carrier (39) and the threads (F7) drawn off from 
the presentation bobbin (54) are supplied directly to the 

coaxial end of the thread-guiding pipe (34). 
Spindle according to Claim 5, characterized in that, with 
a two-for-one twisting spindle, the section of the pipe 

bearing the axially aligned outlet opening (43.3) of the 
pipe (43) guided coaxially through the spindle rotor (45) 

is guided through the base (49.1) of the bobbin carrier 
(49) so as to rotate and the substantially radially 

aligned part (44.2) of the thread-guiding pipe (44) opens 
into the last section (43.2) of the pipe (43), whereby 

the hollow spindle shaft (41) is connected with the bobbin 
carrier (49) by way of a radial fixing device (46) having 

a thread through opening (46.1).
