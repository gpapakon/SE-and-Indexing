<ABSTRACT>
A steerable motor system with integrated formation 
evaluation logging capacity is presented. The device comprises 

a housing, a formation resistivity logging tool (29), a surface 
signaling device (28), a density logging tool, a porosity logging 

tool and a downhole motor (26) and drill (40). The formation resistivity 
logging tool is located below the downhole motor and is mounted 

within the housing wherethrough a drive shaft, extending from 
the downhole motor, is disposed. Power and signal cables are 

located within an outer shell of the housing and connect the 
surface signaling device with the resistivity logging tool. In 

an alternate embodiment, the resistivity logging tool is located 
between a motor stabilizer and the drill bit. The present 

invention allows for increased drill angle during wellbore 
drilling and formation evaluation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for downhole 
drilling and, more particularly, to steerable motor drives with 
formation evaluation capability. Downhole drilling devices of the positive displacement type 
are well known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,135,059, which 
is assigned to the assignee hereof and the disclosure of which 
is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a downhole drill 
which includes a housing, a stator having a helically contoured 
inner surface secured within the housing and a rotor having a 
helically contoured exterior surface disposed within the 
stator. Drilling fluid (e.g., drilling mud) is pumped through 
the stator which causes the rotor to move in a planetary type 
motion about the inside surface of the stator. A drive shaft is 
connected to the rotor via a flexible coupling to compensate for 
the eccentric movement of the rotor. Other examples of downhole 
drilling devices are disclosed in Patent Nos. 4,729,675, 
4,982,801 and 5,074,681 the disclosure of each of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. Formation evaluation tools assist operators in identifying 
the particular geological material through which a drill is 
passing. This feedback of information is used by operators to 
direct the drilling of a well, through, in the case of a 
horizontal well, a desired layer or stratum without deviating 
therefrom. These tools have employed several techniques in the 
past which have been used independently and/or in some 
combination thereof. Formation resistivity, density and 
porosity logging are three well known techniques. One  
 
resistivity measuring device is described in U.S. Patent No. 
5,001,675 which is assigned to the assignee hereof and is 
incorporated herein by reference. This patent describes a dual 
propagation resistivity (DPR) device having one or more pairs of 
transmitting antennas spaced from one or more pairs of receiving 
antennas. Magnetic dipoles are employed which operate in the mf 
and lower hf spectrum. In operation, an electromagnetic wave is 
propagated from the transmitting antenna into the formation 
surrounding the borehole and is detected as it passes by the two 
receiving antennas. The phase and the amplitude are measured in 
a first or far receiving antenna which is compared to the phase 
and amplitude received in a second or near receiving antenna. 
Resistivities are derived from the phase differences and the 
amplitude ratio of the received signals. The formation 
evaluation of DPR tool communicates the resistivity data
