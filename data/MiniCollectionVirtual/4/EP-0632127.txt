<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of a colostrum or a mother's milk of human or mammalian origin for inhibiting the accumulation of proteins on the surface of polymers in contact with biological systems capable of containing proteins. The invention more particularly relates to the care of contact lenses by means of a solution consisting of colostrum or mother's milk of human or mammalian origin and to the treatment processes using this solution.
