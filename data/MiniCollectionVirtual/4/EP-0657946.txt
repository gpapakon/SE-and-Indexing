<ABSTRACT>
A solid state image sensing device, comprises: an n-type 
semiconductor substrate (11), a p-type well (12) 

formed on a surface of the semiconductor substrate, and a 
p⁺-type diffusion layer (13, 21) having an impurity 

concentration higher than that of the well. In particular, 
the P⁺-type diffusion layer (13) is formed so as to cover 

at least a part of circumference of an n-type diffusion 
layer (17) of a load transistor (N3) formed in the well 

(12) as a source follower circuit. Instead, the P⁺-type 
diffusion layer (21) is formed between the n-type diffusion 

layer (17) of the load transistor (N3) and the semiconductor 
substrate (11). In both the cases, since the n-type 

diffusion layer (17) of the load transistor (N3) of the 
source follower circuit is covered with the second conductivity 

diffusion layer (13, 21) higher in impurity concentration 
than that of the well, even when a pulse is applied 

to the semiconductor substrate during electronic shutter 
operation, the p-type well (12) is not depleted, so that 

it is possible to prevent punch through current (I) from 
flowing from the n-type diffusion layer (17) of the load 

transistor (N3) to the n-type substrate (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid state image
sensing device.A solid state image sensing device described in EP-A-0
517 164 has a substrate and an overlying well layer being of
opposite conductivity types, featuring a source follower in
said well which has a relatively high impurity concentration.JP-A-5-63177 describes a source follower having an
improved gain and sensitivity, for constituting the output
unit of a CCD image sensor.From the publication "Physics of Semiconductor Devices",
published by S. M. Sze in 1969, pp 124-126, it is generally
known that the punchthrough voltage is affected by the
background doping level.A further solid state imaging device is described in EP-A-573 292.When a picture moving at a high speed is sensed by a
solid state image sensing device, the solid state image
sensing device is activated by an electronic shutter
operation. In this electronic shutter operation, a pulse
is applied to the semiconductor substrate to extract signal
charges accumulated at respective pixel portions to the
semiconductor substrate side. In this case, however, where
the pixel dimensions decrease with the advance of microminiaturization,
since the relative change in the overflow
channel potential at the pixel portion becomes small
relative to the potential change of the semiconductor
substrate, it has become difficult to extract the signal
charges from the pixel portions to the substrate side. To
improve this problem, it has been necessary to increase the
impurity concentration of the semiconductor substrate.When the impurity concentration of the semiconductor
substrate increases, however, a difference in impurity
concentration between the semiconductor substrate and wells
formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate
becomes small, with the result that when a pulse is applied
to the semiconductor substrate, a punch through phenomenon
is inevitably generated in a source follower circuit of the
output section of the image sensing device. This punch
through phenomenon is explained with reference to the
attached drawing.Fig. 1 shows a structure of an output section in a
solid state image sensing device not forming part of the present
invention. In the drawing, a p-type well 12 is formed in
the surface of an n-type semiconductor substrate 11, and
the output section is formed in this p-type well 12.
Further, the p-type well 12 is connected to the ground. Further, on the surface portion of the p-type well 12,
an N-channel MOS transistor N2 having n-type diffusion
layers 15 and 16 formed
