<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pourable, ready-for-use, thick 
sauce, substantially comprising 10-60% fat, 0.1-2% of a 

cellulose derivative selected from methyl cellulose, ethyl 
cellulose, methyl ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl 

cellulose, 0.1-3% thickening agent, and the balance an aqueous 
phase of a pH ≦ 5. Both at low and at high temperatures, this 

sauce has a relatively constant viscosity behavior. The sauce 
keeps well for a relatively long time, can be dosed easily, 

does not curdle when heated, does not burn and does not become 
essentially thinner at high temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pourable sauce which keeps
well for a relatively long time. More particularly, this
invention relates to a pourable, ready-for-use, thick sauce
which can be eminently and simply enriched to form sauces such
as hollandaise sauce, béarnaise sauce, choron sauce, white
wine sauce, beurre blanc, vegetable sauce, mousseline sauce,
dijonnaise sauce, dill sauce, lemon sauce, etc.. This product
has been primarily developed for restaurateurs/domestic
caterers who thus have at their disposal a product which is
easy to process and on the basis of which they can prepare a
sauce in a short time. In addition, the product is also
suitable for household use.Traditionally, the above-mentioned sauces are typically
prepared on the basis of a butter sauce, also referred to as
egg sauce. Butter sauce essentially comprises egg yolk, lemon
juice or wine, and butter. It is a highly temperature-sensitive
product which curdles very quickly and is therefore
generally prepared in a bain-marie. Further, the product must
be consumed soon after its preparation. All this means that a
restaurateur or domestic caterer cannot keep the product in
store but must on each occasion prepare a desired amount and
so traverse the time-consuming steps of preparation.A number of sauces are known which solve the outlined
stocking problem to some extent. For instance, the firm of
Henri B.V. markets a hollandaise sauce which can be heated to
about 40°C in a bain-marie with stirring. This instant sauce
is substantially composed of egg yolk, butter, white wine,
water, flavoring, vegetables, caseinate, salt and vegetable
protein hydrolysate. At refrigeration temperature, the product
has a very thick, ragout-like consistency and can be scooped
from the package. When this product, which contains about 33%
fat, is heated to a temperature above about 60°C, fat
separation arises. Also, lumps are formed, which cannot be
eliminated anymore through stirring. The product is quick to 
burn. Because this sauce is an emulsion sauce of butter, the
product has an agreeable taste.The problems relating to heating are not solved by the
above-discussed known product. These problems arise to a
lesser extent in products having relatively high contents of
vegetable oils, for instance Garde d'Or, hollandaise sauce,
Uniquisine, sold in the Netherlands by Van den Bergh
Professional B.V. Rotterdam.As a result of its relatively high content of vegetable
oils, this known ready-for-use product is substantially fluid,
though a part of the sauce must be
