<ABSTRACT>
A method for the treatment of wool so as to impart shrink resistance and which comprises treating the wool simultaneously with permonosulphuric acid, or a salt thereof, one or more scouring or wetting agents and one or more fibre swelling or dispersing agents. In a preferred embodiment, the method of treatment further comprises subjecting the wool to a polymer treatment. The method may be operated either as a continuous or as a batch process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the 
treatment of wool so as to impart shrink resistance, 
and which involves treating the wool simultaneously 
with permonosulphuric acid, a scouring or wetting 
agent and a fibre swelling or dispersing agent. Many ways of rendering wool shrink resistant 
are known. These typically involve subjecting the 
wool to an oxidative treatment alone or, more commonly 
nowadays, followed by a polymer treatment. Various two-step shrink-proofing processes 
in which wool is treated first with a chlorinating 
oxidative agent and subsequently with a pre-formed 
synthetic polymer have been developed. A wide variety 
of polymers can be used in aqueous solution or 
dispersion, including polyamide-epichlorohydrin resins 
and polyacrylates. A review of work in this field by 
J. Lewis appears in Wool Science Review, May 1978, 
pages 23-42. British Patent Nos. 1,074,731 and 
1,340,859, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,926,154 and 2,961,347 
and European Patent Application No. 0129322A, for 
example, describe two-step shrink-proofing processes 
and resins or polymers suitable for use therein. A number of chlorinating oxidative 
treatments, or pre-treatments, for use on wool are 
well known. The source of chlorine may be chlorine 
gas supplied from cylinders, chlorinating agents such 
as hypochlorite and dichloroisocyanuric acid and their 
salts. For example, British Patent No. 569,730 
describes a batch shrink-proofing treatment involving 
hypochlorite and potassium permanganate; British 
Patent No. 2,044,310 describes a treatment with an 
aqueous solution of permanganate and hypochlorite. In 
all cases the active principle remains the same. Permonosulphuric acid and its salts have  
 
been known for some time to confer reasonable levels 
of shrink resistance to wool either when used alone, 
as disclosed in British Patent No. 1,084,716, or in 
combination with a chlorinating agent, as disclosed in 
British Patent No. 1,073,441. British Patent No. 
738,407 describes a process for the manufacture of 
permonosulphuric acid from hydrogen peroxide and 
concentrated sulphuric acid. The product is said to 
be suitable for use as a bleaching agent and various 
other purposes. British Patent Nos. 872,292 and 
991,163 disclose processes for the shrink-proofing of 
wool which comprise treating the wool with 
permonosulphuric acid and a permanganate, or with an 
aqueous solution of permonosulphuric acid at a 
temperature in excess of 70Â°C, respectively. British 
Patent No. 1,071,053 describes a treatment for

<CLAIMS>
A method for the treatment of wool so as to 
impart shrink resistance and which 

comprises treating the wool simultaneously with 
permonosulphuric acid, or a salt thereof, one or more 

scouring or wetting agents and one or more fibre 
swelling or dispersing agents. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
subsequent neutralisation of the residual peroxy 

compounds on the wool is performed in the presence of 
a further quantity of scouring or wetting agent. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
which further comprises subjecting the wool to a 

polymer treatment. 
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
polymer is applied prior to the neutralisation step. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the scouring or wetting 

agent comprises a non-ionic or anionic surfactant. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the scouring or wetting 

agent is an alkylene oxide derivative of a fatty 
alcohol or alkyl phenol. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the fibre swelling or 

dispersing agent comprises a long chain ethylene oxide 
derivative of a fatty alcohol, fatty acid or alkyl phenol. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the permonosulphuric acid is 

used at a level of from 0.1 to 6.0% by weight on the 
weight of the dry wool. 
A method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the scouring or wetting 

agent is used in an amount of from 0.25 to 10.0% by 
weight on the weight of the dry wool.
