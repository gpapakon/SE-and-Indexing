<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to wound treatment formulations and methods for treating wounds utilizing these formulations. The formulations according to the present invention are useful for treating wounds by accelerating wound healing. These formulations comprise an effective amount of a cellular nutrient medium in combination with an effective amount of at least one cellular growth stimulating compound, e.g. a non-steroidal anabolic hormone or transforming growth factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compositions
and methods using such compositions for promoting wound healing
of skin and related tissues. More particularly, the
invention relates to wound healing compositions which are
based on a cellular nutrient medium in combination with at
least one anabolic protein growth hormone or growth factor.A skin wound is defined as a breach in the continuity
of any body tissue caused by a minimal direct injury to the
skin. There are many instances where a quick closure of the
wounded skin will promote a beneficial response. Generally,
quick closure of wounded skin can be achieved either by conservative
methods such as the application of medicaments, or
alternatively, by using various surgical procedures including
suturing, split skin grafting or grafting of new skin grown in
culture.The closure of a wound with skin cells is performed
using two methods: either by grafting skin grown in culture or
alternatively, by split skin grafting. These two methods are
applicable, however, only after a suitable base of granulation
tissue has first developed in the wound, the development of
which may be quite prolonged or complicated. Split skin
grafting, although more common, requires compositions which
contain materials for maintaining organ viability and treatment
of the wounds for the repair of injury to the skin.Among the most common injuries to skin are burns.
Burn causes destruction of the epidermis and deeper cutaneous
and subcutaneous tissues, most of which can be regenerated by
the normal healing response if the area burned is not
extensive or contaminated. Burns cause more than 2,000,000
injuries annually in the U.S.A., and more than 10,000 deaths
each year result from serious burn injuries. S.T. Boyce et al., in The Journal of Investigative
Dermatology, 81: 33S-40S, 1983) describes compositions based
upon a serum-free culture system to culture normal human
epidermal keratinocytes. These compositions comprise
optimized nutrient medium MCDB 153 supplemented with epidermal
growth factor, insulin, hydrocortisone, ethanolamine, phosphoethanolamine
and whole Bovine Pituitary Extract (wBPE). It is
mentioned that the wBPE initiates the primary culture and that
cellular senescence occurs after about forty population doublings.
It has also been reported in the Journal of Cellular
Physiology, 110, 219, (1982), that the incorporation of Fetal
Bovine Serum Protein (FBSP) may replace whole serum for
culturing human epidermal keratinocytes and that the presence
of F12 would eliminate
