<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates particularly to a system of electrical linking between an electronic circuit produced on a substrate (14) on an electrically conducting baseboard (13) fixed in an electromagnetic screening box and a coaxial socket (10) fixed against one outer wall (12) of the screening box, the core (16) of the socket (10) being engaged in a housing (18) of the wall (12) in order to be linked to the electronic circuit, the socket (10) having an earth surface situated facing the said wall (12), this system being characterised in that the earth contact between the socket (10) and the baseboard (13) is achieved by means of an electrically conducting ring (30) arranged coaxially with respect to the core (16), insulated from this core (16) and simultaneously in electrical contact with the earth surface of the socket (10) and the baseboard (13) when the socket (10) is fixed against the wall (12) of the box.

System for making an electrical connection between 
an electronic circuit implemented on a substrate (14) on an 

electrically conductive bottom plate (13) fixed into an 
electromagnetic shield box and a coaxial socket (10) fixed to 

an outside wall (12) of said shield box, the core (16) of said 
socket (10) being inserted in a hole (18) in said wall (12) in 

order to be connected to said electronic circuit, said socket 
(10) having an earthing surface facing said wall (12),
 
   characterised in that the earthing contact between said 

socket (10) and said bottom plate (13) is made by way of an 
electrically conductive ring (30) coaxial with said core (16), 

insulated from said core (16) and simultaneously in electrical 
contact with said earthing surface of said socket (10) and 

said bottom plate (13) when said socket (10) is fixed to said 
wall (12) of said box. 
System according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said ring (30) cooperates with an electrically conductive 

spring washer (50) coaxial with said core (16) between said 
earthing surface and said ring (30). 
System according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said ring (30) is elastic. 
System according to claim 3 characterised in that 
said elastic ring (30) is made from a synthetic material 

charged with metal. 
System according to claim 1 characterised in that 
said coaxial socket (10) is fixed to said wall (12) of said 

box by screws (11) and each screw (11) cooperates with a 

spring washer (60). 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that said box has a flange (15) to which said 

substrate (14) is fixed and having a notch (70) at the 
location of said hole (18) in said wall (12) to provide access 

to the microstrip access line of said electronic circuit. 
System according to any one of claims 1 to 6  
 

characterised in that said ring has a flat (80) adapted to be 
soldered to said bottom plate (13). 
Electrical connection device for use in an 
electrical connection system according to any one of claims 1 

to 7, of the type comprising a coaxial socket (10) having a 
core (16) and an earthing surface, characterised in that it 

comprises an electrically conductive ring (30) insulated from 
said core (16) and coaxial therewith.
