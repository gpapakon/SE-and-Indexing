<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a biologically 
active multimeric polypeptide molecule in which two or 

more monomeric subunits are linked together as a single 
polypeptide ("fusion multimer"). These fusion multimers 

are more easily and rapidly refolded than unfused 
multimers, because the reactions necessary to generate 

the biologically active multimeric form of the 
polypeptide proceed with first order, rather than second 

or higher order, reaction kinetics. Fusion multimers 
also eliminate the simultaneous formation of undesired 

polypeptide by-products during refolding. The fusion 
multimers of the present invention specifically include 

PDGF fusion dimers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Human platelet-derived growth factor ("PDGF") 
is believed to be the major mitogenic growth factor in 
serum for connective tissue cells. The mitogenic 
activity of PDGF has been documented in numerous 
studies, wherein PDGF has been shown to positively 
affect mitogenesis in arterial smooth muscle cells, 
fibroblast cells lines, and glial cells. Deuel et al., 
J. Biol. Chem., 256(17), 8896-8899 (1981). See also, 
e.g., Heldin et al., J. Cell Physiol., 105, 235 (1980) 
(brain glial cells); Raines and Ross, J. Biol. Chem., 
257, 5154 (1982) (monkey arterial smooth muscle cells). 
PDGF is also believed to be a chemoattractant for 
fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and 
granulocytes. Because of its apparent abilities to both 
induce mitogenesis at the site of connective tissue 
wounds, and to attract fibroblasts to the site of such 
wounds, PDGF is thought to have particular potential for 
therapeutic use in the repair of injured, or 
traumatized, connective tissues. Other members of the PDGF family include 
vascular endothelial cell growth factor ("VEGF", 
sometimes also referred to as "vascular permeability 
factor, or "VPF") and placental growth factor ("PLGF"). 
Tischer et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 165(3), 
1198-1206 (1989) and Maglione et al., Proc. Natl Acad 
Sci. USA, 88, 9267-9271 (1991), respectively. Both VEGF 
and PLGF form disulfide bonded dimers from the eight 
highly conserved cysteine residues that appear in the 
PDGF homologous region of each monomeric unit of these 
PDGF family members. Tischer et al. and Maglione etal., ibid. The receptors for VEGF and PLGF are also in 
the same receptor subfamily as the PDGF receptors. 
Consequently, these "newer" members of the PDGF family 
are thought to be potentially useful as therapeutic 
products in wound repair, although they have not been 
studied as extensively as PDGF. Naturally occurring PDGF is a disulfide-bonded 
dimer having two polypeptide chains, namely the "A" and 
"B" chains, with the A chain being approximately 60% 
homologous to the B chain. Naturally occurring PDGF is 
found in three dimeric forms, namely PDGF-AB 
heterodimer, PDGF-BB homodimer, or PDGF-AA homodimer. 
Hannink et al., Mol. cell. Biol., 6, 1304-1314 (1986). 
Although PDGF-AB has been identified as the predominate 
naturally occurring form, it is the PDGF-BB homodimer 
that has been most widely used in wound healing studies.

irrespective of whether it is an A chain monomer or a B 
chain
