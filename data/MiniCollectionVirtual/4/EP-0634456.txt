<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vulcanizable,
fluorine-containing elastomer composition. More
particularly, the present invention is concerned with a
vulcanizable, fluorine-containing elastomer composition
which is capable of providing a vulcanization product
having not only excellent tensile properties, resistance
to heat and oils, and sealability at high temperatures
which are comparable to those of vulcanization
products of conventional fluorine-containing elastomer
compositions, but also having a remarkably improved
compression set resistance which has not conventionally
been achieved, and which elastomer composition perse
is remarkably improved with respect to mold release
properties, flowability, roll processability, and
workability in vulcanization molding, particularly in
vulcanization molding by injection.In general, a vulcanization product of a
fluorine-containing elastomer has excellent resistance
to heat and oils and, therefore, has been widely utilized
in various industrial fields, such as in the 
fields of automobiles, ships, aircrafts and hydraulic
devices and general machine industries, and in the
field of devices for the prevention of environmental
pollution. Examples of vulcanization products of a
fluorine-containing elastomer include O-rings, gaskets,
oil seals, diaphragms, hoses, rolls and sheets. Recently,
an improvement in productivity and a laborsaving
have been earnestly desired in the production of
vulcanization products. Accordingly, it has been
desired to develop a fluorine-containing elastomer
having excellent workability in a vulcanization molding
thereof. Particularly, since vulcanization molding of
a fluorine-containing elastomer by injection is advantageous
from a viewpoint of not only an improvement in
productivity but also a labor-saving, the demand for a
fluorine-containing elastomer which is suitable for
vulcanization molding by injection, has increased.As mentioned above, a vulcanization product of a
fluorine-containing elastomer composition has excellent
resistance to heat and oils. However, a fluorine-containing
elastomer is generally not satisfactory in
mold processability due to the high viscosity thereof
as compared to other types of elastomers. In order to
improve processability of a fluorine-containing elastomer
composition, it has been attempted to lower the 
molecular weight of the elastomer so as to increase the
flowability of the elastomer composition. However,
this attempt has been unsuccessful. That is, the
obtained elastomer composition is
