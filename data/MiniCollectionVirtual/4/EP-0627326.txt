<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conversion liquid for 
converting the ink accepting silver areas on a hydrophilic 
background of a lithographic printing plate into ink repellant areas 
and the hydrophilic background areas into ink accepting areas. Lithographic printing is the process of printing from specially 
prepared surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting ink 
(oleophilic areas) whereas other areas will not accept ink 
(oleophobic areas). The oleophilic areas form the printing areas 
while the oleophobic areas form the background areas. Particular interesting printing plates are those prepared from a 
silver halide photographic material according to the silver salt 
diffusion transfer process. The principles of the silver complex 
diffusion transfer reversal process, hereinafter called DTR-process, 
have been described e.g. in US-P 2,352,014 and in the book 
"Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion Processes" by Andr√© Rott and 
Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London and New York, (1972). In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an 
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into 
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into 
an image-receiving layer and are reduced therein with a developing 
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to 
form a silver image having reversed image density values 
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the 
exposed areas of the photographic material. The image-receiving layer may be a surface layer on top of the 
silver halide emulsion layer or may be present as a surface layer on 
a separate receiving material. Since the silver image formed in the 
image receiving surface layer is hydrophobic or can be rendered 
hydrophobic it will form the ink accepting portions of the printing 
plate while the non-silver areas are hydrophilic and thus ink-repellant 
to greasy inks. According to a further alternative the 
image receiving layer may be located between a hydrophilic support 
and the silver halide emulsion layer. After development according  
 
to the DTR-process, this silver halide emulsion layer and any 
optional layer between the image receiving layer and silver halide 
emulsion layer is removed in e.g. a wash-off process by rinsing e.g. 
with plain water. A disadvantage of DTR-printing plates is the fact that they are 
generally positive working i.e. the image values in the original 
will
