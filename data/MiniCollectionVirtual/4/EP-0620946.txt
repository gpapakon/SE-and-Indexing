<ABSTRACT>
The method and device are applicable to the bushings (2) of the cover (1) of a pressure water nuclear reactor vessel in operation. The device comprises a double circuit for taking two gas samples (100, 16, 17; 12, 13, 14, 15) and a measuring unit (18) comparing regularly the content particularly of water vapour in both samples. The first sample is taken from the volume of the chamber (7) into which the leak (10) leads and the second sample is taken at the vicinity of the cover (1) outside the area of immediate influence of the leak. The unit or assembly (18) generates (19) an arlarm in the case of a leak and discriminates such an alarm from operation alarms. Techniques and means are also provided to determine the scavenging flow rate in the volume of the chamber (7) and to monitor the sample taking and detection systems.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the detection of leaks from openings (2) in 
the cover (1) of the tank of a nuclear reactor, 

characterised in that it comprises a discharge circuit 
for the air circulating in the interior of a chamber 

(7) where any leaks (10) discharge before this air is 
diluted in a cooling circuit (4, 5, 6) for operating 

mechanisms (3) of the controls of the reactor. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
discharge circuit comprises ramps (12) which are 

fitted with intake pipes (13) passing through the 
thermal insulation (8, 9) of the cover (1) of the tank 

and which are attached to thermal insulation strips 
(20) and interconnected (12) by means of a common 

collector (14). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
discharge circuit comprises several ramps (12) 

attached to the thermal insulation strips (20) and 
fitted with multiple intake pipes (13) disposed 

virtually in a square around each opening (2) so as to 
permit individual observation of each of the openings 

(2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
discharge circuit comprises at least one fitting (22) 

connecting the interior of the changer (7) to the 
cooling circuit (4, 5, 6) for the operating mechanisms 

(3) of the controls so as to draw in all the air 
circulating in the interior (7) where any leaks (10) 

may discharge.  
 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 4, 
characterised in that the discharge circuit comprises 

an intake collector (14) or several interconnected 
discharge ramps (12) sloping into one or several 

fittings (22) connecting the interior of the chamber 
(7) where any leaks (10) discharge into the cooling 

circuit (4, 5, 6) of the operating mechanisms (3) of 
the controls. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 4, 
characterised in that the fitting or fittings (22) are 

provided with a recording means (23) to allow the 
differential pressure to be adjusted between the 

interior of the chamber (7) enclosing the joining 
areas (10) of the cover (1) and openings (2) and the 

interior of the enclosure (4) containing the operating 
mechanisms (3) of the controls by means of a 

differential pressure sensor (24). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it comprises an assembly (18) 

for measuring a difference in the concentration of 
steam released by a leak (10), said difference 

measured between the air discharged into the interior 
of the chamber (7), defined by the thermal insulation 

(8, 9) of the cover and the cover (1) of the tank 
itself, and the ambient air of the structure of the 

reactor (100). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 7, 
characterised in that the measurement assembly (18) 

effects measurement of the difference in the 
concentration of steam in two samples of air, one 

taken from the interior of the chamber (7) and the  
 

other from the structure of the reactor (100), said 
two samples being passed alternately into two 

identical parallel-branch cooled-surface hygrometers 
(28 and 29). 
Device according to one of Claims 1, 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the measurement assembly (18) 

comprises a filter (27) for removing dust and vapours 
other than steam in order to prevent soiling of the 

two hygrometers (28 and 29) and reduce maintenance 
operations of these. 
Device according to one of Claims 1, 7, 8 and 9, 
characterised in that it comprises an absolute 

pressure sensor (30) to allow correction of the 
partial pressure of steam should pressure differences 

exist between the discharge collector (14) and the 
reference pipe system (16) connected to the structure 

of the reactor (100). 
Device according to Claims 1, 7, 8, 9 and 10, 
characterised in that the measurement assembly (18) is 

connected to a processing and monitoring unit (19) 
able to generate an alarm (40) indicating a leak (10) 

as soon as the difference in the concentration of 
steam measured between the air discharged in the 

chamber (7) and the ambient air in the structure of 
the reactor (100) is greater than measurement 

uncertainties. 
Device according to one of Claims 1, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 
11, characterised in that the measurement assembly 

(18) is connected to a processing and monitoring unit 
(19) able to generate an alarm (41) when the  

 
differences in measurements become abnormally high, 

said alarm being to indicate that a maintenance 
operation or repair of the detectors is necessary. 
Device according to Claims 1, 7, 8, 9 and 10, 
characterised in that the measurement assembly (18) is 

installed in a sealed cabinet (37) which is 
thermostatically controlled and is itself equipped 

with detachable means for its connection to the 
discharge circuit. 
Process for simultaneously testing the proper function 
of the device according to one of Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 

7, 8 and 11, characterised in that it simulates the 
presence of a leak by injecting steam (56, 57, 58, 59, 

60, 61, 62, 63) close to (64) the locations where 
there is the risk of leaks (10) occurring.
