<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rapamycin derivatives,
pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives,
and methods of treatment of pathogenic fungi, methods of
inducing immunosuppression and methods of treating
carcinogenic tumors utilizing such rapamycin
derivatives.Rapamycin is a naturally occurring macrocyclic
triene antibiotic which can be produced by culturing an
organism in an aqueous nutrient medium. Its structure
may be illustrated as follows:
At least one rapamycin-producing strain of
Streptomyces hygroscopius was deposited with the
Northern Utilization and Research Division, Agricultural
Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Peoria, Illinois, U.S.A. under accession number NRRL
5491. Rapamycin, and methods for its'preparation by
culturing NRRL 5491 are disclosed by U.S. Patent
3,929,992, issued December 30, 1975, the entire
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.This invention relates to novel rapamycin
derivatives of the formula:

wherein:
R1 is selected from the group consisting of =O,
(-OR6, H) and (H,H);R2 is selected from the group consisting of =O or
(H,H), provided that at least one of R1 and R2 is (H,H);R3 is selected from the group consisting of -OH,
-OC(=0)R7, -OC(=0)OR7, -OC(=0)NHR7, and -OC(=S)OR7;R5 is selected from the group consisting of -H and
C1-C4 alkyl;R6 is selected from the group consisting of -H,
-C(=0)R7, -C(=0)OR7, -C(=0)NHR7, and -C(=S)OR7 and;R7 is selected from the group consisting of
C1-C10 alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, aryl groups, and 
heterocyclic groups;
provided that when R1 is (-OR6,H), R2 is (H,H), and R5
is H, then R3 is other than OH;
   and all pharmaceutically acceptable salts,
hydrates or solvates thereof.This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical
composition comprising an effective amount of one or
more compounds of Formula II and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier or diluent.This invention also relates to the use of a
compound of Formula II for the manufacture of a
medicament for use in inhibiting the growth of
pathogenic fungi in a human or other animal.This invention also relates to the use of a
compound of Formula II for the manufacture of a
medicament for use in inducing immunosuppression in a
human or other animal.This invention also relates to the use of a
compound of Formula II for the manufacture of a
medicament for use in treating carcinogenic tumors in a
human or other animal.Still further, this invention relates to
compounds of Formula III which are useful as
intermediates for preparing compounds of Formula
