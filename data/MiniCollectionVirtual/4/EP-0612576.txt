<ABSTRACT>
A welding arc stabilizer (101) includes a source of 
high voltage (102) and a switch (103) for switching the 

source of high voltage across an electrode (106) and a 
workpiece (107) in the event the arc rectifies. The high 

voltage is switched across the electrode (106) and 
workpiece (107) within the completion of the half cycle in 

which rectification occurred. The source of high voltage 
(102) includes a resonant LC circuit. An arc sensing 

circuit (104), including a resistor (206), a capacitor 
(207), and a zener diode (205) is provided in parallel with 

the arc. In the event the voltage applied to the electrode 
(106) and workpiece (107) exceeds the zener diode breakdown 

voltage, indicating the arc has rectified, an SCR (203) 
disposed between the resonant circuit (102) and electrode 

(106) or the workpiece (107) is turned ON, thus connecting 
the source of high voltage (102) between the electrode 

(106) and workpiece (107) to re-establish the arc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to ac GTAW 
welding and, in particular, to an apparatus for stabilizing 
the arc when GTAW welding. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), also called tungsten 
inert gas (TIG) welding, is a well known method for 
welding metals, in particular aluminum and magnesium. A 
description of GTAW, including the problems associated 
with welding aluminum and magnesium, may be found in 
Welding Handbook. Chapter 3, Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, 
pages 74-107, 1991, published by the American Welding 
Society. It is well known in GTAW to use an ac square wave 
power source, which is particularly suited for welding 
aluminum and magnesium. An ac square wave power source 
provides an output having a straight polarity (electrode 
negative) half-cycle and reverse polarity (electrode 
positive) half-cycle, with a rapid transition between half 
cycles. One such ac square wave power source is described in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,038,515, (the '515 patent) issued July 
26, 1977 to Robert L. Risberg. The device disclosed in the 
'515 patent provides an ac square wave welding current 
output, with adjustable asymmetry or balance, i.e. the 
duration of the electrode positive and electrode negative 
half-cycles may be adjusted with respect to one another. 
As disclosed in the '515 patent it is desirable to provide 
such asymmetry control. The device disclosed by Risberg 
includes a four SCR bridge with an inductor in the dc leg, 
wherein current flows through the inductor in the same 
direction regardless of the direction of the current 
through the arc. In this manner, the inductor is able to 
provide a desirable rapid zero crossing to reduce arc 
rectification. However, the arc will still occasionally 
rectify. In particular, extinguishing of the arc (called 
arc rectification if the arc is extinguished on one of the  
 
half cycles on a recurring basis) or arc instability can 
occur when the current reverses to the electrode positive 
half cycle because of the difficulty in establishing a 
"cleaning" arc which has a higher voltage than a "welding" 
arc. Another ac square wave power supply is described in 
U.S. Patent 4,371,776, issued to Winn, Feb. 1, 1983 (the 
'776 patent). The '776 patent also discloses a commutator 
circuit which is used on the electrode positive half cycle 
to maintain the arc as the polarity switches from electrode 
negative to electrode positive. The commutator circuit 
provides a high voltage on every such transition, not on an 
as need basis. It is also known to provide a
