<ABSTRACT>
In a mobile system for short-range communication, 
mobile units or vehicles are moving within the coverage 

area (1) of the system. Beacons (VB, RB) are arranged to 
communicate with the mobile units for obtaining and 

delivering information respectively to the mobile units 
for determining traffic situations, road situations and 

so forth in the coverage area. As beacons, virtual 
beacons (VB) are included which are in connection with at 

least one higher-level unit (NBLT). In the last-mentioned 
unit, the virtual beacons are represented in tables, 

preferably through information on access telephone 
numbers and positions of the virtual beacons in the 

system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement devised for nerwork planning and configuration testing
for an RTI system, which system is
devised to provide short-range communication where mobile units or
vehicles move within the coverage area of the system and
where beacons (radio beacons) are arranged to communicate
with the mobile units for obtaining and delivering
information from and respectively to the mobile units for
determining traffic situations in systems in the coverage
area. The invention also relates to a
method devised for nerwork planning and configuration testing for an RTI system.American patent specification US 5,126,941
discloses a system for control and guidance of vehicles.
The system comprises a central unit with control and
storage capabilities and communications units intended to
be placed at the edge of the road, for example beacons.
The vehicles are provided with equipment for handling
guidance and control information from the units. The
positions of each beacon are stored in the central memory
in the form of two tables with the vertical and,
respectively, horizontal coordinates. These coordinates
are downloaded to the respective beacon, after which this
information can be transferred to passing vehicles.American patent specification US-A-5173710 describing a beacon-based navigation and positoning system shows one way in which a beacon can be made to be not physically present at its geographical position. That way however does not permit bidirectional communication.In European specification 320,913, a method for
locating a mobile telephone is described. The fixed base
stations send out identity signals and precise time
pulses from their fixed locations. Signal transmission is
carried out either as a response to an interrogation
signal from the mobile or automatically at predetermined
time intervals. The mobile unit can utilize internally
stored tables of positions of the fixed base stations in
calculating its own position. The known method is
intended to be used for monitoring and controlling 
vehicle traffic. The method means that high costs for
setting up a new fresh infrastructure for traffic monitoring
can be avoided.American patent specification US 5,043,736
discloses a cellular locating system. The system consists
of a portable locating unit which can be used both as
mobile telephone and for global positioning. The unit has
a receiver for receiving signals from a global
positioning system and circuits for calculating the
position. The position thus obtained is then

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement devised for network planning and configuration testing for an
RTI system, which system is devised to provide short-range communication and

where mobile units (M1) or vehicles are moving within the coverage area (1) of the
system, and where beacons, for instance radio beacon, are arranged to communicate with the

mobile units for delivering and obtaining information on traffic within the coverage
area, the arrangement being characterised by comprising a central higher-level unit

(MBLT), in which said beacons are represented by stored data, comprising data on
their positions and access telephone numbers, the arrangement providing the

possibility of adding, removing or changing beacons by changing said stored data in
the higher-level unit (MBLT).
Method for network planning and configuration testing for an RTI system,
which system is devised to provide short-range communication and where mobile

units (Ml) or vehicles are moving within the coverage area (1) of the system, and
where beacons, for instance radio beacon, are arranged to communicate with the mobile units

for delivering and obtaining information on traffic within the coverage area, the
method being 
characterised in
representing said beacons in a central higher-level unit (MBLT) by
storing data on said beacons, comprising data on their positions and access
telephone numbers, in the higher-level unit (MBLT), providing the possibility of
adding, removing or changing beacons by
changing said stored data in the higher-level unit (MBLT), thereby providing the
possibility of
testing a system configuration.
The method as recited in claim 2, in which,

testing of beacon placements in a system configuration is achieved by
test running vehicles in the system, said vehicles
communicating with said beacons when passing them.
