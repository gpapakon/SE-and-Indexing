<CLAIMS>
Pastes for manufacturing printed conductors,
resistors, capacitors or solders from powdery

materials present in liquid dispersion from the group
of the metals, metal compounds and/or alloys and/or

boron and/or carbon, characterised in that the powdery
materials are one or more of the group of the

refractory metals, precious metals, transition metals,
oxide compounds of refractory metals, silicides,

titanates, zirconium oxide, indium-tin oxide and rare
earth oxides and the liquid dispersions are ones based

on water which contain water-dilutable, nonionic,
rheological additives in mixtures of 0.2 to 20 wt %,

referred to the solid content, and are free of film-forming
substances and organic solvents.
Pastes according to claim 1, characterised in that the
amount of the additives comes to 0.5 to 15 wt %.
Pastes according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the nonionic, rheological

additives are associative thickeners based on
polyglycol ether.
Pastes according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the nonionic, rheological

additives are associative thickeners based on
polyurethane.
Pastes according to claim 4, characterised in that the
associative thickeners are ones based on toluylene 

diisocyanates (TDI) and/or hexamethylene diisocyanates
(HDI).
Pastes according to one or more of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that they have a content of 5 to

95 wt % of the powdery materials.
Pastes according to one or more of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that they have a solid content of 50

to 90 wt % of the powdery materials.
Pastes according to one or more of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that their solids do not contain any

residual organic substances after a heat treatment at
550 Â°C.
Pastes according to one or more of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the pastes are metallization

pastes, wherein the powdery materials are refractory
metals from the group niobium, tantalum, molybdenum,

tungsten, rhenium, precious metals from the group
gold, silver, platinum, palladium and/or transition

metals from the group iron, chromium, cobalt, nickel
and titanium.
Pastes according to one or more of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the powdery materials belong to

the group of the refractory metal oxides, the niobates
and/or tantalates and/or titanates.
Pastes according to one or more of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the silicides are preferably 

molybdenum silicide and/or tungsten silicide of
varying stoichiometry.
Process for manufacturing the pastes according to one
or more of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the

powdery materials are dispersed in water and are mixed
with the associative thickeners.
Use of the pastes according to one or more of claims 1
to 11 for the coating of substrates by printing

techniques, preferably screen printing, offset
printing and/or knife application and/or pouring and/or

dipping and/or spraying and/or electrostatic
deposition methods.
Use of the pastes according to one or more of claims 1
to 11 for layers which are structured by means of a

printing technique or litho-graphically.
