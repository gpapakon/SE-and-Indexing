<ABSTRACT>
A lowly toxic and excellent inhibitor for restenosis after percutaneous coronary arterioplasty containing as the active ingredient 
a compound represented by general formula (1) or (1') or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R¹ and R² represent 

each independently hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro, C₁₋C₆ alkyl or C₁₋C₆ alkoxy, or alternatively R¹ and 
R² are combined together to form methylenedioxy; R³ represents aryl, aromatic heterocycle, 5-to 

7-membered cycloalkyl or 
5- to 7-membered cycloalkenyl each of which may be substituted; R⁴ represents hydrogen, hydroxy, - 

S-glutathionyl, -S-(α-amino 
acyl) or aralkyl wherein the aryl group may be substituted; R⁵ represents hydrogen or C₁-C₆ 

alkyl, or alternatively R⁴ 
and R⁵ are combined together to form a single bond; Y represents oxygen or sulfur; n represents an integer of 0 to 5; and 

the selenium atom may be oxidized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical agent 
for inhibiting restenosis after percutaneous coronary 
arterioplasty (hereinafter referred to as PTCA). PTCA is a relatively new approach to the treatment of 
ischemic heart diseases, which involves mechanical 
dilatation of the stenosed region of the coronary artery by 
balloons. However, the mechanically dilated part of the 
coronary arteries is known to undergo restenosis in several 
months after operation with a frequency of about 40%. Thus, 
PTCA is not a radical therapy for stenosed lesions 
of the coronary arteries. In order to inhibit the 
restenosis, antiplatelets, anticoagulants, etc. have 
heretofore been studied, but drugs which provide 
satisfactory clinical results have never been 
discovered. Accordingly, there remains a need for a pharmaceutical 
agent which exhibits excellent inhibiting effect against 
restenosis after PTCA. Compounds of the following formula (1) or (1') are 
known to be useful as antioxidants having glutathione 
peroxidase-like activity and/or lipoxigenase inhibitory 
activity (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application  
 
Laid-open Nos. 59-42373, 57-67568, 59-39894, 60-226868 and 
61-50963, Biochemical Pharmacology, vol. 33, No. 20, 3235 to 
3239 and 3241 to 3245 (1984)). However, the interrelation 
between these activities and the effect of inhibiting post-PTCA 
restenosis has remained unknown. The invention of JP-A-01 294 622, titled "A Drug for Inhibiting 
Adherence and Aggregation of Leukocyte", is intended 
for treatment of inflammatory microcirculatory disorder. The 
concept of this reference is based on the finding that the 
compound 2-phenyl-1,2-benzylisoselenazol-3(2H)-one has a capability 
of preventing exudation of inflammatorily affected 
cells, and can therefore serve as an anti-thrombogenic activator. The invention of JP-A-01 131 114, titled "A Drug for 
Treatment of Heart Disease", is based on the finding that the 
compound 2-phenyl-1,2-benzylisoselenazol-3(2H)-one can exhibit 
an excellent pharmaceutical behavior in suppressing the 
initial lesion emerging after paroxysm of coronary ischemia, 
particularly this compound is effective for protection of 
tissue system. In view of the above, the inventors of the present 
invention have conducted careful studies and, as a result, 
have found that the compounds of the following formula (1) 
or (1') have an excellent effect of inhibiting restenosis 
after PTCA. The present invention has been accomplished 
based on this finding. According to the
