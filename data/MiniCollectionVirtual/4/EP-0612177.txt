<ABSTRACT>
The circuit arrangement according to the invention monitors a transmission line (ÜL) with respect to the transmission of activation signals and is itself capable of outputting activation signals to the transmission line (ÜL). After an activation signal has been detected, the circuit arrangement initiates the activation of a device (EG) connected to the transmission line (ÜL), which, as a result, is displaced from the idle state into the normal operating state. The device (EG) is therefore in each case only in the normal operating state when it is actually used by the user. Overall, this results in much lower loading on the power supply units. Furthermore, the circuit arrangement according to the invention allows the reliable detection of actuation signals even when there are still noise or information signals on the transmission line (ÜL).

<CLAIMS>
Method for the activation of terminal units
(EG) of a communications system, which are connected to

each other by way of a common transmission line (ÜL),
each of which is provided for the emission of

activation signals to all other terminal units (EG),
characterized in that in each terminal unit (EG) the

transmitted communications signals are processed in a
first receiving channel and the activation signals are

processed in a second receiving channel, in which a
comparator (COMP) is provided, which compares the

received activation signals with a reference voltage
(ref-s) and, after the detection of an activation

signal, emits a control signal to a control unit (PS),
by means of which the terminal unit (EG) is shifted

from an energy-saving mode into the normal operating
mode and the first receiving channel is put into

operation.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that a filter stage (RC-F) is connected upstream of the

comparator (COMP), which filter stage allows low-frequency
activation signals to pass to the control

unit (PS) and blocks higher-frequency interference
signals or useful signals transmitted on the

transmission line (ÜL).
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that a regulating circuit is connected

upstream of the comparator (COMP) or the filter stage
(RC-F), by means of which regulating circuit its input

signals are regulated to the value of a reference
voltage (ref-n), and in that the time constant of the

regulating circuit is selected in such a way that the
activation signals are relayed practically unimpaired.
Terminal unit (EG) for a communications
system, which has several terminal units (EG) connected

first receiving channel for the transmitted
communications signals is provided and a second

receiving channel for the activation signals is
provided, in which a comparator (COMP) compares

received activation signals with a reference voltage
