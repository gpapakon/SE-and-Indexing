<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to proteases derived from strains of Bacillus sp.
More specifically, the invention is directed towards a novel alkaline protease derived
from a strain of Bacillus sp. PD498, as well as isolated biologically pure cultures of
Bacillus sp. PD498.Moreover, the invention is directed towards a process for the
preparation of the protease, detergent additives and detergent compositions
comprising the protease of the invention, and the use of this protease in washing
processes.Detergent enzymes have been marketed for more than 20 years and
are now well established as normal detergent ingredients in both powder and liquid
detergents all over the world. With the trend towards lower washing temperature,
detergent enzyme consumption has increased during late years. Enzymes used in
washing formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as
other enzymes, or mixtures hereof. Commercially most important are proteases.Detergent proteases have been developed by isolation of proteases
found in nature followed by testing in detergent formulations. Most detergent
proteases are obtained from members of the genus Bacillus. Currently new types
of proteases enter the market, offering the possibility of giving a better cost/performance
ratio at various specified conditions.Examples of commercial protease products are ALCALASE™,
ESPERASE™ and SAVINASE™, all supplied by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark. These
and similar enzyme products from other commercial sources are active in detergent
solutions, i.e. at pH values in the range of from 8 to 11 and in the presence of
sequestering agents, surfactants and bleaching agents such as sodium borate. The
ALCALASE™ protease is produced by strains of the species Bacillus licheniformis. 
The ESPERASE™ and SAVINASE™ proteases are obtained by cultivation of strains
of alkalophilic Bacilli.According to the present invention novel detergent proteases are
provided.In its first aspect, the invention provides a protease having an apparent
molecular weight of 34 kD as determined by SDS-PAGE, a pI of 9.3,
a pH optimum in the range of pH 9-11 determined at 25°C (with casein as
substrate), a temperature optimum in the range of 40-55°C determined at pH 9.5
(with casein as substrate), and immunochemical properties identical
to those of a protease derived from Bacillus sp. PD498, NCIMB No. 40484.In another aspect, the invention provides a protease having an
apparent molecular weight of 34 kD as determined by SDS-PAGE, a pI of
9.3, a pH optimum in the range of pH
