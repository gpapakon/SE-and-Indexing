<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid network includes a public switched network and a private 
switched network. Each has a respective network management system 

(2, 4). Between these systems are two interfaces, a service management 
interface (7) and a network management interface (8), whereby 

information can be shared between the two systems in order to provide 
common management of the public and private networks and the 

services provided thereby. A hybrid network management system within 
the private network management system can thus form a single view of, 

for example, the network faults and performance analysis of the public 
and private networks, which together form the overall network of a 

corporate customer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to network management and in particular to the integrated
management of public and private switched networks and services, that is to
hybrid network management.A specific hybrid network to be discussed hereinafter is made up of private,
customer owned equipment, and public carrier owned equipment and services.
Historically, public network services and private network services have been
managed independently without any common synergistic service and network
management benefit. However this situation is changing due to advances in
customer and telco (telephone company) management equipment, carrier
services and the demand by customers to manage their private and public
network based services in a common manner to increase service management
efficiency and cost savings.An OSI-based interoperability architecture for managing hybrid networks is
described by 1 Sugarbroad in IEEE Communications Magazine, vol. 28, No. 3,
March 1990, pp 61 to 69. The management of a metropolitan area network is
described by R Vercelli et al. in IEEE Network Operations and Management
Symposium, vol. 1, 6 April 1992, pp 68 to 77. Private network resource
management is described by C Siller et al. in Globecom 89, vol. 1, 27 November 1989,
pp 522 to 526. The end customer management of hybrid networks is discussed
by K Meola et al. in Network Operations and Management Symposium, 29
February 1988 (New Orleans), pp 1 to 11. According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a
telecommunications hybrid network comprising a public network and a private
network, said public network and said private network each having a respective
network management system, said public network incorporating a fault
management system and a performance management system, characterized in
that each of said network management systems comprises a user access layer,
a service management layer incorporating systems responsible for
administration and management of services, a network management layer
incorporating network resource management means, an element manager and
network element layer, a service management interface provided between the
respective service management layers of the public network and private network
management systems, and a network management interface provided between
the respective network management layers of the public network and private
network management systems, wherein the public network incorporates a
resource management system, and wherein information is shared between the
two network

<CLAIMS>
A telecommunications hybrid network comprising a public network and
a private network, said public network and said private network each having a

respective network management system (2, 4), said public network incorporating
a fault management system and a performance management system,


characterized in that
 each of said network management systems (2, 4)
comprises a user access layer, a service management layer incorporating

systems responsible for administration and management of services, a network
management layer incorporating network resource management means, an

element manager and network element layer, a service management interface
(7) provided between the respective service management layers of the public

network and private network management systems, and a network management
interface (8) provided between the respective network management layers of the

public network and private network management systems, wherein the public
network incorporates a resource management system, and wherein information

is shared between the two network management systems across the service
management interface and across the network management interface in order to

achieve common management of the public and private networks and to achieve
common management of services for customers having some of their network

based on the private network and some of their network based on the public

network.
A hybrid network as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the public
network management system includes a service management system,

information from which can be passed over the service management interface to
the hybrid network management system in the private network to manage the

public network services.
A hybrid network as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the
public network management system includes an accounting management

system, and wherein for providing corporate customer with a single bill for public
and private network based services, the hybrid network is adapted to pass billing

data and call detail record information over the service management interface
from the private network network management system to the accounting

management system.
A hybrid network as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the
accounting management system includes a hybrid network billing and 

accounting management application for consolidation of public and private
network billing.
A telecommunications hybrid network according to any one of claims
1-4 in which the public network is a switched public network and in which the

private network is a private switched network.
A method of managing a telecommunications hybrid network
comprising a public network and a private network, said public network and said

private network each having a respective network management system (2, 4)
comprising a user access layer, a service management layer incorporating

systems responsible for administration and management of services, a network
management layer incorporating network resource management means, an

element manager and network element layer, a service management interface
(7) provided between the respective service management layers of the public

network and private network management systems, and a management
interface (8) provided between the respective layers of the public network and

private network management systems, wherein the public network incorporates
a fault management system, a performance management system and a

resource management system, and wherein the method comprises the steps of
sharing information between the two network management systems across the

service management interface and across the network management interface in
order to achieve common management of the public and private networks and to

achieve common management of services for customers having some of their
network based on the private network and some of their network based on the

public network.
A method according to claim 6 in which the public network is a
switched public network and in which the private network is a private switched

network.
