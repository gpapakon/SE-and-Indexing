<ABSTRACT>
A transparent visor (2), particularly for a vehicle having a windscreen, is disclosed, the transparent visor (2) being associated with an opaque visor (1) and being swivel mounted at its top on the bottom portion of the opaque visor (1) by means of a connecting system (40, 30). Said connecting system (40, 30) consits of first and second parts placed substantially at opposite ends of the top of the transparent visor (2) and the bottom of the opaque visor (1) respectively. The two parts (40, 30) provide rotation of the transparent visor (2) with respect to the opaque visor (1) in a first axis parallel to the top of transparent visor (2), while the first part (40) enables the transparent visor (2) to be separated from the opaque visor (1) in such a way that the second part (30) provides for pivoting about a point at the top of the transparent visor (2).

A transparent visor (2), notably for a vehicle possessing a windshield, said
visor (2) being complementary to an opaque sun visor (1) and being fastened, hinged

by its upper portion to the lower portion of said sun visor (1) by means of a connecting
system (40, 30) composed of a first (40) and a second parts (30), the connecting

system (40, 30) allow the rotation of the transparent visor (2) according to the opaque
visor(1), the first parts (40) enable the transparent visor (2) to be separated from the

opaque visor (1), the first parts (40) is substantially placed, respectively, at the top of
the transparent visor (2) and the bottom of the opaque visor (1), is characterized by the

fact that the said second parts (30) is placed substantially at the opposite ends of said
upper portion of the transparent visor (2) and of the lower part of the opaque visor (1)

respectively, in such way that the said rotation is in the first axis along the plane of
such sun visor (1) and passing trough the first (40) and the seconds parts (30), and the

said second parts (30) provides, moreover, a movable hinge around a point of the
upper portion of the transparent visor (2)
A visor according to Claim 1 wherein said first part (40) of said means of
connecting system is composed of a hook (17, 18) vertically-attached to said main visor

(1) and receives said visor (2), and wherein said second part of said means of
connecting system is essentially composed of a horizontal rod (9) forming a horizontal

axis of rotation that enters a horizontal aperture (3) made in said visor (2) and having a
shoulder support at one end, said horizontal rod (9) being equipped with an opening

mean to receive said second rod (7) forming an axis of rotation perpendicular to said
first axis, said second rod (7) being fastened/attached to the main visor (1).
A visor according to Claim 1 wherein said first part (40) of said means of
connecting system is composed of a hook (17, 18) vertically attached to said main visor

(1) and receives said visor (2), and wherein said second part (30) of said means of
connecting system is essentially composed of a horizontal rod (9) and of a second rod

(7), said horizontal rod (9) forming a horizontal axis of rotation that penetrates a
horizontal opening made in said visor (2) and having a shoulder support at one end,

said horizontal rod (9) being equipped with an opening designed to cooperate with the
end in the form of a socket of said second rod (7) in which the other end is fastened to

the main visor (1).
A visor according to Claims 2 or 3 wherein said opaque visor has a
framework (16) in the lower portion in which two nuts have been fastened at a vertical

axis at which the hook (17) of said first part (40) of the means of a connecting system
and the second rod (7) of said second part (30) are respectively set up. 
A visor according to Claims 2 or 3 wherein, to the opposite ends of the lower
portion of said main visor (1), have been made two holes (10, 11) to a vertical axis in

which respectively the hook (17) of said first part (40) of said means of a connecting
system and the second rod (7) of said second part (30) can be used stoppers (14, 15)

being planned for to close said holes (10, 11) when said visor (2) is not mounted onto
the main visor (1).
A visor according to Claims 2 or 3 wherein the hook (18) of the first part (40)
of said means of a connecting system presents one part in the form of a clip that is

fastened to said opaque visor (1).
A visor according to any one of Claims 2 through 6 wherein an opening (4)
is cut out of the transparent visor (2) to go together with said hook (17).
A visor according to any one of Claims 2 through 6 wherein the hollow
section of said hook (18) takes on a form corresponding to that of the upper portion of

said transparent visor (2).
A visor according to any one of the preceding claims wherein it is fitted with
an adaptable frame setting (5).
