<ABSTRACT>
This is a method and a computerised apparatus for mounting at least one clipped image (11,12,12a) into a page (10). The clipped image is placed (14) in an image memory virtual space (15), the description of the document page described in vector mode is transformed (16) into a description in Run Length mode, with a resolution termed the working resolution, then the size of each input pixel of the clipped image to be set in place is calculated (18) as a number of working pixels, the address in the image memory virtual space (15) of the first input pixel of each Run Length segment is calculated (20), and for each segment, the size of the said first input pixel is adjusted (23) by giving it an adjusted dimension in working pixels.
