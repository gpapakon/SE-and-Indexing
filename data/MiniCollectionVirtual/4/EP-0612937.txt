<ABSTRACT>
A torque converter has an end cover (10) or 
input shell which is stamped from a sheet metal plate 

and has a stiffening portion (12) and an outer flow 
formed annular rim (26). Fastening lugs (18) are 

welded to the end cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to torque converters, 
and more particularly, to the manufacture of torque 
converters. Specifically, this invention relates to 
the manufacture of an end cover for a torque 
converter. Torque converters have an end cover which is 
welded to an impeller so as to close the torque 
converter which is comprised of the impeller, a 
turbine and a stator disposed in toroidal flow 
relation, and a torque converter clutch which is 
disposed to frictionally engage the end cover. The end covers of the known torque 
converters are formed by stamping a flat sheet metal 
component into an end cover shape wherein a central 
pilot is formed, a circulator strengthening rib area 
is formed, and the outer periphery is bent away from 
the pilot diameter to form an outer annular rim 
portion. The lugs for connecting the torque converter 
to an engine are welded onto the stamping, after which 
the lugs and the stamping are machined on both sides. 
The dies for creating or manufacturing the stamping 
require high level investment as well as a very long 
lead time for replacement parts. Thus, the tooling 
costs for the torque converter end cover are quite 
extensive. The end cover is welded to the impeller or 
pump assembly to thereby form a pressure vessel for 
the torque converter. Currently, the end cover is 
welded to the impeller by using either electron beam 
welding, mig welding or most recently, laser welding. 
Each of these welding processes has its own particular 
set of undesirable characteristics and all make use of 
a filler material in the form of welding wire which  
 
contributes to sediment within the transmission 
assembly. Mig welding is the slowest and least clean 
of the processes and adds a significant amount of 
process time and sediment. Electron beam welding 
requires high maintenance and capital investment 
welding equipment as does laser welding. When the end cover has been welded to the 
impeller, it is then necessary to provide for 
balancing the torque converter. The three internal 
components, that is, the impeller, turbine and stator, 
are dynamically balanced prior to being assembled 
within the pressure vessel. After final assembly, 
however, it becomes necessary to again dynamically 
balance the entire torque converter. The dynamic 
balance of the assembly is accomplished by fixing the 
internal components at one position and determining 
the imbalance by rotating the assembly on a 
conventional balancing machine. The internal components, that is, the 
turbine, clutch

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a torque converter 
end cover (10), comprising the steps of forming an 

annular flat blank with material removed to provide a 
central pilot opening (16); stamping an annular 

stiffening portion (12) in the blank intermediate the 
pilot opening and an outer periphery of the blank; 

securing attaching lugs (18) to the blank on a forward 
face (14) thereof intermediate the stiffening portion 

and the outer periphery; and spin forming a portion 
(26) of the blank adjacent the outer periphery to an 

axially extending attachment surface (30). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 
comprising the additional step of polishing a clutch 

engaging surface (20) on an inner annular portion of 
the stamped blank. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 
2, wherein the annular stiffening portion is dish 

shaped (12). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 
2, wherein the annular stiffening portion is defined 

by ribs (12). 
A method of forming a torque converter 
comprising the method as claimed in any one of Claims 

1 to 4, and welding the axially extending attachment 
surface (30) to an impeller (54).
