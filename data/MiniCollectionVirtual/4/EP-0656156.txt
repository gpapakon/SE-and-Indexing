<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a rotor structure 
for an electrical machine comprising an axle and 
a rotor core packet of stampings consisting of annular 
plates, in which method the annular plates are arranged on the axle. Figure 1 of the enclosed drawing shows a conventional 
rotor structure for an electrical machine 
consisting of an axle 1, a rotor core packet of 
stampings 2 with essentially annular plates 6 arranged 
on the axle, pressure rings 3 mounted to clamp the ends 
of the rotor core packet of stampings and in the case 
of a squirrel-cage machine rotor rods 4 and short-circuiting 
rings 5 connected to them. The rotor rods are 
in that case mounted in grooves die cut on the circumference 
of the plates in the rotor core packet of 
stampings. Practical experience has shown that although 
the rotor core packet of stampings of the engine and its 
winding is made as homogeneous and symmetrical as possible, 
especially in the case of high-speed bipolar 
machines, the change of the balance status due to temperature 
differences causes vibration problems in a 
finished machine. The object of the present invention is to 
manufacture a rotor structure which in use has minor 
vibration problems compared to a conventional rotor 
structure. This is achieved by means of the method claimed in the ensuing claim 1. If the rotor structure comprises pressure rings 
mounted to support the ends of the rotor core packet of  
 
stampings in the axial direction, the end faces of the 
pressure rings facing towards the rotor core packet of 
stampings are preferably given a shape corresponding to the 
truncated cone shape of the rotor core packet of 
stampings. In practice the truncated cone shape of the 
end faces of the pressure rings can be achieved either 
so that their end faces are completely like a truncated 
cone with their coning angle corresponding to the coning 
angle of the plates of the rotor core packet of 
stampings or alternatively the end faces of the pressure 
rings facing towards the rotor core packet of 
stampings comprise one or more essentially annular 
areas, at which the pressure rings are in contact with 
the end plates of the rotor core packet of stampings. In the following the invention will be 
described in greater detail with reference to the 
attached drawing, where 
Figure 1 illustrates the rotor structure of a 
conventional electric machine, Figure 2 illustrates the die-cut edge of a 
plate in the rotor core packet of stampings of the rotor 
structure,

A method of manufacturing a rotor structure for an electrical machine 
comprising an axle (1) and a rotor core packet of stampings 

(12) consisting of annular plates (6) in which method the annular plates (6), are placed on the 
axle after having been heated to a temperature exceeding 

100째C, 
characterized
 in that when shrinking 
the plates (6) of the rotor core packet of stampings (12) 

are allowed and/or forced to buckle into a generally 
frustoconical shape so that the coning angle of the 

plates (6) is between about 2째 and 5째, preferably about 
3째.

truncated cone of the rotor core packet of stampings. 
A method according to claim 2, 

characterized
 in that the end faces of the 
pressure rings (13A, 13B) are given the shape of a truncated 

cone and the coning angle of the end faces corresponds to 
the coning angle of the plates (6) of the rotor core 

packet of stampings (12).

pressure rings (23A, 23B) facing towards the rotor core 

packet of stampings (12) comprise one or more essentially 
annular areas at which the pressure rings are in contact 

with the end plates of the rotor core packet of stampings.
