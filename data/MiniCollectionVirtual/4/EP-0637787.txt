<ABSTRACT>
A Flight Management Systems for aircraft whereby time-constrained 
flight can be achieved while maintaining 

predetermined input parameters selected for minimizing cost 
of flight, wherein arbitrary points in the flight plan can 

be designated as time-constraint points, and wherein flight 
segments can be arbitrarily selected for exclusion from any 

speed variation. A speed generator (10) derives an initial 
speed schedule for each segment of a flight plan from inputs 

of a predetermined cost index, the flight plan, and aircraft 
performance parameters. The speed schedule is modified by 

wind data, constant speed segments, and predetermined speed 
limits. When applied to a profile generator (18) an 

estimated time of arrival is computed, as well as predicted 
distance and velocity values for each segment of flight. 

The predicted values are used to compute a total time of 
arrival. When compared with a given arrival constraint time 

and the estimated time of arrival, a speed correction factor 
is derived which, when fed back to the profile generator, 

results in adjusting the estimated time of arrival to 
coincidence with the arrival constraint time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The U.S. Government has rights in this invention pursuant to
Contract No. F33657-87-C-2084, awarded by the Department of
the Air Force.The invention relates to Flight Management Systems for
aircraft, and in particular to an apparatus and method
whereby time-constrained flight can be achieved while
maintaining predetermined input parameters selected for
minimizing cost of flight, wherein arbitrary points in the
flight plan can be designated as time-constraint points, and
wherein flight segments can be arbitrarily selected for
exclusion from any speed variation.A Flight Management System (FMS) provides the crew of
an airplane with extensive capabilities for planning and
carrying out the flight of their aircraft. One of the
principal goals of the modern FMS is to optimize the cost of
the flight, based on a predetermined set of parameters. In
current practice these parameters are specified so that they
define the actual cost in fuel and flight time for a given
flight plan. These parameters are determined carefully so 
that they match the performance characteristics of the
aircraft under consideration as closely as possible. The
result of this exercise in optimization is a flight plan
that contains target altitudes and speeds for each leg or
segment of the flight. However, since the objective is to
provide an optimum flight plan (i.e., a minimum cost of
flight), the time of arrival at any destination is a result
of the optimization calculations, and therefore will not
necessarily match any desired arrival time, which may be
constrained by factors such as costs of crew time, need to
match schedules of connecting flights, and air traffic
control metering fixes.The difficulty caused by this approach is found in the
pragmatic necessity for a flight to reach a destination,
whether it be an interim waypoint or a final destination, at
a predetermined time. Requirements for such time
constraints are seen in the need to arrive at an oceanic
gateway within a specified time window, or the need to
arrive at an airport at a specified time in order to be
allowed access to the terminal. Many other requirements for
time constrained navigation can be found in both the
military and commercial arenas.Any attempt to solve the problems presented by these
time constraints will inherently involve the current
estimated time of flight, the time of flight required by the
time constraint or required time of arrival (RTA), the
distance of the flight, and the speed of the aircraft.
These parameters, along with those that were used to
