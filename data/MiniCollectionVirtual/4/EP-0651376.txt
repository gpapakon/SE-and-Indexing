Slider incorporating welding studs (24, 40, 42,
44) for assembly with a spring arm, characterized in that

each welding stud comprises on the one hand a base (40)
integral with the slider (10, 58), said base having a controlled

height (h) and being made from a first material and
on the other hand a meltable stud member (42) placed on the

base (40), said meltable stud member (42) being made from a
second material having a melting point lower than that of

the first material.
Slider according to claim 1, characterized in
that the first material is a conductive material.
Slider according to claim 2, characterized in
that the conductive material is chosen from the group constituted

by copper, nickel and nickel alloys.
Slider according to claim 1, characterized in
that the second material is taken from the group constituted

by tin, lead, indium and alloys thereof.
Slider according to claim 1, characterized in
that for at least one of the welding studs, the base (40)

is in contact with an electrical connection located on the
slider (58).
Process for the production of a slider/spring arm
assembly, the slider being in accordance with claim 1,

characterized in that it comprises the following
operations:


on a slider (58) are formed bases (40) from a first
material having a first melting point, said bases having a

controlled height (h),
on each of the said bases (40) is then formed a second
meltable stud member (42) from a second material having a

second melting point below that of the first material,
the spring arm (56) is assembled on the slider (58) in
a position forming the working position of the assembly, 
the temperature of the studs (40, 42) is raised to above the second
melting point of the second material, but below the first melting point of

the first material.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that deposition also takes
place of supplementary, meltable stud members (44) on the end of the spring

arm (56), said supplementary stud members (44) being made from the second
material and being placed at locations corresponding to the meltable stud

members (42) deposited on the bases (40), said supplementary stud members
(44) being welded to the first stud members (42) during the temperature

raising operation.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that at least one of the
bases (40) is formed on a connection track deposited on the slider (58)

facing a connection track deposited on the spring arm (56).
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the bases (40) are
produced by the following operations:


a thin conductive coating (32) is deposited on a substrate (30),
on said conductive coating (32) is deposited a photosensitive film (34)
having a thickness (h) equal to the minimum desired spacing between the

slider and the end of the spring arm,
in the said film (34) openings (36) are formed at appropriate locations,
conductive studs (38) are formed in said openings by electrolytic growth

of the first material, the conductive coating (32) serving as the electrode,
the studs (40) obtained are planarized in order to obtain the bases (40).
Process according to claim 9, characterized in that the meltable stud
members (42) are formed by electrolytic growth of the second material on the

bases (40).
