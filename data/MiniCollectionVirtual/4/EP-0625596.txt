<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for adjusting the distance (clearance) between the working cylinders and the main cylinder and/or between the doffer roller and the main cylinder in a carding machine. Device characterised in that it consists, for each working cylinder (1) and/or for the doffer roller, of a support and mounting means (4) whose position can be adjusted on the frame (2) of the machine and which interacts with a positioning device (5) which has automatic adjustment. The invention is more particularly applicable to the field of the manufacture of textile machines.

A system for adjusting the distance between the
workers and the swift and/or between the doffer and the

swift of a card, comprising, for each worker (1) and/or
for the doffer, a support and mounting means (4)

adjustable in position on the frame (2) of the machine
and co-operating with an automatic-adjustment

positioning device (5), characterised in that the
support and mounting means (4) adjustable in position

on the frame (2) of the machine comprises, for each end
of the shaft (1') of the worker (1), a plate supporting

the said end by means of a bearing (6) and fixed on the
machine frame (2) by means of sets of screws (7) and a

stack of elastic washers (8), the screws (7) extending
through oblong holes (9) in the said plate and the

shaft (1') extending through an oblong hole (2') in the
frame (2).
A system according to claim 1, characterised in
that the automatic-adjustment positioning device (5)

co-operating with the support and mounting means (4)
adjustable in position on the frame (2) consists

preferably of a template (10) mounted with the
possibility of rotation by means of an actuator (11) on

the frame (2) and co-operating with the plate which
forms the means (4) for supporting the end (1') of the

worker (1).
A system according to claim 2, characterised in
that the template (10) is advantageously in the form of

a polygonal element, each surface of which is provided
with a rod (10') for abutment with a corresponding end 

of the plate forming the means (4), the different rods
(10') having unequal lengths.
A system according to claim 2, characterised in
that the actuator (11) preferably comprises a jack, the

piston rod of which co-operates with a ratchet or the
like (12) secured to the template (10) by means of its

rotational shaft.
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that each plate forming the support

and mounting means (4) adjustable in position on the
frame (2) of the machine is connected to a longitudinal

traversing means (14), preferably in the form of a
jack.
A system for adjusting the distance between the
workers and the swift and/or between the doffer and the

swift of a card, comprising, for each worker (1) and/or
for the doffer, a support and mounting means (4)

adjustable in position on the frame (2) of the machine
and co-operating with an automatic-adjustment

positioning device (5), charfacterised in that the
support and mounting means (4) adjustable in position

on the frame (2) of the machine comprises, for each end
of the doffer shaft, a slide which forms a bearing

guided in a rail of the frame (2) and provided with a
rod or the like intended, on the one hand, to cooperate

by its free end with the automatic-adjustment
positioning device (5) and provided with a means for

connection to a longitudinal traversing device (14).
A system for adjusting the distance between the
worker (1) and the swift (15) and/or between the doffer 

and the swift (15) of a card comprising, for each
worker (1) and/or for the doffer, a support and

mounting means (16) adjustable in position on the
machine frame (2) radially with respect to the axis of

the said swift (15) and comprising an eccentric bush

(21) for fixing the position of the worker (1) or the
doffer relatively to the clearer (22), and co-operating

with the frame (2), said support and mounting means
(16) being actuated by a drive and control device (17),

characterised in that the means (16) also comprises a
first eccentric bush (18) mounted in an end bearing

(19) of a support arm (20) secured to the machine frame
(2).
A system according to claim 7, characterised in
that the drive and control device (17) comprises a

motor and reduction gear unit (23) which acts, via a
pinion (24) meshing with an intermediate pinion (25),

on a pinion (26) secured to the first eccentric bush
(18) receiving the shaft (1') of the worker (1) or of

the doffer, the pinion (24) also being secured to the
second eccentric bush (21) co-operating with a guide

(29) provided on the frame (2), by a first sensor (27)
monitoring the rotary position of the first eccentric

bush (18) connected to the motor and reduction gear
unit shaft and by a second sensor (28) for initialising

the device (17) connected to a counting unit and co-operating
with the pinion (24) of the motor and

reduction gear unit (23).
