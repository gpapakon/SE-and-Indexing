<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for carrying materials and products onto and out from a table (13) of a working machine (1), comprising: a 
stocker (5R, 5L) provided with shelves (3) arranged in a plurality of stages for allowing material-pallets and product-pallets to 

freely move onto and out from the shelves (3) and a pallet supporting elevator (75) provided vertically movably with respect to the 
stocker (5R, 5L), for carrying the pallets (P) onto and out from the shelves (3) and supporting the pallets (P); wherein the pallet 

supporting elevator (75) is provided at the top portion thereof with a work holding portion (109) which can hold materials and 
products and at the bottom portion thereof with a work pallet supporting device (95) for holding and releasing a work pallet (Pk) 

in order to transfer a work pallet (Pk) to and from a working table (13) of a working machine (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for 
transferring materials and products with respect to a worktable of 
a processing machine of the type as defined in the preamble of 
claim 1. Conventionally, an automated structure or warehouse 
which serves as a stacker for storing pallets carrying 
materials or products, is known. The automated warehouse is 
disposed apart a certain distance from a processing machine 
which may be, for example, a laser processing machine. 
Accordingly, when the material is taken out of the automated 
warehouse to be processed into products by the processing 
machine, the material is transferred from the automated 
warehouse to the processing machine through a loading 
device. In addition, the products processed by the 
processing machine are transferred therefrom to the 
automated warehouse through a unloading device, at present. By the way, as is mentioned above, the loading and 
unloading devices are demanded and arranged to be used in 
the prior art, for transferring the materials and products 
between the stacker and the processing machine, and 
therefore it causes a problem that relative time is required 
both for moving the materials from the stacker to the 
processing machine and for discharging the products from the 
processing machine to the stacker.  
 A device for transferring materials and products with respect 
to a worktable of a processing machine according to the type as 
defined above, is described in US-A-4 035 904. The known device 
comprises a plurality of pallets for loading articles to be 
worked. The articles to be worked will be transferred from the 
stacker to a developing portion. Manipulators are provided 
which will convey the articles to be worked from the pallet 
resting on the developing portion to the tool and will convey 
the worked articles thereafter one by one from the tool back to 
the pallet. A processing pallet and means for handling it are 
not provided.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide an 
improved transfer device for transferring materials and 
products with respect to a processing machine adjacent to 
which a stacker is disposed, wherein pallets for carrying 
the materials or products are automatically passed to and  
 
discharged from the stacker as well as processing machine 
in a relatively short time and as a result working efficiency 
or productivity of the processing machine is increased. In order to attain the above-mentioned object, a 
device for transferring materials and products with 
respect to a worktable
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for transferring materials and products with 
respect to a worktable (13) of a processing machine, 

comprising:
 
a pallet stacker (5R, 5L) having a plurality of shelves 

(3) to and from which material and product pallets (P) 
are passable and dischargeable; and
 
a pallet carrying elevator (75) provided in a vertically 

movable manner with respect to the pallet stacker (5R, 
5L), the pallet carrying elevator (75) being able to 

support and pass and discharge the pallet (P) with 
respect to the shelves (3),
characterised in that
 
the pallet carrying elevator (75) is provided at an 

upper portion thereof with a work holding means (109) 
for holding the material and product and at a lower 

portion thereof with a supporting device (95) for 
holding and releasing a processing pallet (Pk), for 

passing and discharging the processing pallet (Pk) with 
respect to the worktable (13). 
The device of claim 1 
characterised in that
 first and 
second stackers (5R, 5L) are provided which are disposed 

adjacent to each other,
 
the pallet carrying elevator (75) is provided with first 

and second pallet supporters (91, 93), the first pallet  
 

supporter (91) being able to support the material or 
product pallet (P) discharged to a position 

corresponding to the first stacker (5R), the second 
pallet supporter (93) being able to support the material 

or product pallet (P) at a position corresponding to the 
second stacker (5L);
 
the supporting device (95, 97) is mounted under the 

first and second pallet supporters (91, 93);
