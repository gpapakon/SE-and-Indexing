<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of hydrofluoroalkanes, and in 
particular to a process for the production of 
mixtures of hydrofluoroalkanes comprising 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and other 
hydrofluoroalkanes, for example 
1,1-difluoroethane, pentafluoroethane, 
1,1,1-trifluoroethane and difluoromethane. In recent years there has been increasing 
international concern that chlorofluorocarbons, 
which are used on a large scale around the world, 
may be damaging the earth's protective ozone layer 
and there is now in place international 
legislation to ensure that their manufacture and 
use is completely phased out. Chlorofluorocarbons 
are used, for example, as refrigerants, as foam 
blowing agents, as cleaning solvents and as 
propellants for aerosol sprays in which the 
variety of applications is virtually unlimited. 
Consequently, much effort is being devoted to 
finding suitable replacements for 
chlorofluorocarbons which will perform 
satisfactorily in the many applications in which 
chlorofluorocarbons are used but which will not 
have the aforementioned damaging effect on the 
ozone layer. One approach in the search for 
suitable replacements has centred on fluorocarbons 
which do not contain chlorine but which contain 
hydrogen. The hydrofluorocarbons 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, also known as HFA 134a. 
difluoromethane, also known as HFA 32, 
pentafluoroethane, also known as HFA 125,  
 
1,1-difluoroethane, also known as HFA 152a and 
1,1,1-trifluoroethane, also known as HFA 143a, as 
well as mixtures thereof, are of interest as such 
replacements, in particular as replacements in 
refrigeration, air-conditioning and other 
applications. Many processes have been proposed for the 
production of hydrofluoroalkanes which do not 
contain chlorine, and in particular for the 
production of HFA 134a, which is the first of 
these hydrofluoroalkanes to have been commercially 
produced. Thus it is has been proposed in United 
Kingdom Patent Specification No. 1,589,924 to 
produce HFA 134a by the vapour phase fluorination 
of 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane (HCFC 133a) 
which is itself obtainable by the fluorination of 
trichloroethylene as described in United Kingdom 
Patent Specification No. 1,307,224. The formation of HFA 134a as a minor product 
of the fluorination of trichloroethylene is 
described in United Kingdom Patent Specification 
No 819,849, the major reaction product being HCFC 
133a. More recently, processes for the production 
of HFA 134a from trichloroethylene based
