<ABSTRACT>
Venting device, in particular for an ostomy bag, consisting of an essentially flat casing (11) comprising a base (20) which has a surface internal to the casing and a surface external to the casing, designed to be fixed via the said external surface on an exposed surface of the said bag and equipped with an opening (23) communicating with the said bag, as well as a flap valve (50) of the type which is closed at rest, the said flap being formed by a closure member designed to bear on the said opening (23) of the said base on the side of the said internal surface and forming a single piece together with elastic means (51, 52) for pushing the said member back against the said base (20) with a predetermined return force. The casing (11) comprises a removable lid (21) which is designed to close the said base (20), and the flap (50) is integral with the said lid (21).

A degassing device, particularly for a stomal pouch, consisting of a flat casing 
(11) comprising a bottom (20) having one face inside the casing and one face outside the 

casing, adapted to be fixed by the said outer face onto an exposed face of the said pouch 
(P) and provided with an aperture (23) communicating with the said pouch, as well as a 

valve (50) of the type which is closed when at rest, the valve being formed by a closure 
member adapted to apply itself to the said aperture (23) in the said bottom on the side of 

the inner face and constructed in one piece with resilient means (51, 52) for pushing the 
said member back against the said bottom (20) with a predetermined restoring force, 

characterised in that the casing (11) comprises furthermore a removable cover (21) 
adapted to close the said bottom (20) and in that the valve (50) is rigid with the said cover 

(21). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the resilient means (51, 52) 
consist of at least one elastically deformable flattened surface (51, 52) extending between 

the said cover (21) and the said closure member. 
A degassing device according to claim 2, characterised in that the said bottom 
(20) and the said cover (21) are produced in the form of a one-piece blank, preferably by 

injection moulding of a plastics material, bridges of material connecting the bottom and 
cover of the blank in such a way that the distance between the said cover (21) and the said 

closure member (50) is greater than the distance between the said bottom (20) and the 
said cover (21) in the final casing (11) obtained by breaking the bridges of material and 

closing the said bottom with the said cover. 
A degassing device according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that a filter 
(12) comprising a central hole (15) is so housed in the said casing (11) that it is gripped 

between the said valve (50) and the said bottom, its hole becoming an extension of the 
said aperture (23) in the said bottom (20). 
A degassing device according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that 
the assembly formed by the said cover (21) and the said closure member is shaped to 

allow manual operation of the said valve (50).  
 
A degassing device according to claim 5, characterised in that 

the said casing (11) is cylindrical and in that 
the said cover (21) is fastened to the said bottom (20) in such a way that it can 
be displaced in relation to the said bottom thanks to manual actuating means and 

according to a rotary movement about the axis (A) of the casing (11). 
A degassing device according to claim 6, characterised in that the cover (21) 
is fixed to the bottom (20) by simple interlocking and in that the manual actuating means 

consist of a radially projecting lug (45) on the cover (21). 
A degassing device according to claim 7, characterised in that the said bottom 
(20) comprises another radially projecting lug (35) adapted to serve as an indexing 

reference for that of the cover (20). 
A degassing device according to any one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in that 

the said closure member (50) is rigid with at least one radial member (71) 
adapted to circulate, when the said manual actuating means are operated, in a guide in the 

said bottom extending circumferentially and of such a form that the said finger (71) can, 
according to its position in the said guide, be free or be raised against the said resilient 

means and along a ramp (38) on the guide. 
A degassing device according to claim 9, characterised in that there is also a 
position in which the said finger (71) can be locked under a hook (37) on the said guide. 
A degassing device according to any one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in that 
the said closure member consists of a needle, the cover (21) likewise comprises at least 

one boss (66) while the said bottom (20) comprises at least one helical ramp (38) on 
which the said boss (66) is adapted to move between a low position and a high position 

when the cover (21) is turned in relation to the said bottom (20) so that, in the low 
position, the said pointer is restored by elastic means in order to close the said aperture 

(23) while in the high position the said needle is pushed back out of the aperture (23) 
against the said resilient means. 
A degassing device according to claim 11, characterised in that there are three 
bosses (66) and three ramps (38) disposed in radial positions at 120° in respect of one 

another.  
 
A degassing device according to claim 12, characterised in that the said bosses 
(66) are integral with a stud (62) which carries the said pointer at its end, the free ends 

(68) of the said bosses (66) being set back in relation to the pointer so that the said pointer 
enters the said aperture (23) when the said bosses (66) are in the low position. 
A degassing device according to any one of claims 11 to 13, characterised in 
that the said casing (11) comprises a interior space (19) adapted to accommodate a filter 

and bounded by a cylindrical wall (41) comprising axial cut-outs (49) communicating with 
windows on the top of the cover so that the gases are able to escape despite the presence 

of a filter inside the casing (11). 
A degassing device according to claim 14, characterised in that the bottom 

(20) comprises an interior relief (25) adapted to pinch the filter so that the gases are 
forced to pass through the filter in order to escape through the cut-outs (49) and windows 

(39). 
A degassing device according to any one of claims 11 to 15, characterised in 
that the cover (21) is fixed on the bottom (20) by a bayonet type of fitting. 
A degassing device according to claim 16, characterised in that the said 
bottom (20) and the said cover (21) comprise returned edges (33, 43) adapted to co-operate 

so that once the said bottom (20) and the said cover (21) have been fitted 
together, the edges (33, 43) co-operate to prevent them from becoming separated, the 

said returned edges (33, 43) extending over a segment of approx. 90° and being disposed 
in a diametrically opposite relationship on the cover (21) and on the bottom (20). 
A device according to claim 17, characterised in that the cover (21) fits inside 
the bottom (20), the returned edges (43) on the cover (21) projecting outwardly while the 

returned edges (33) on the bottom (20) project inwardly. 
A degassing device according to one of claims 16 to 18, characterised in that 
at least one returned edge (33) extends in an axial column (34) which is appropriately in 

abutment in order to prevent the bottom (20) and the cover (21) being able to turn beyond 
a certain amount and in that the bosses (66) do not therefore leave the said ramp (38). 
A stomal collecting pouch comprising a device (10) for degassing and 
monitoring the internal pressure in accordance with any one of the preceding claims.
