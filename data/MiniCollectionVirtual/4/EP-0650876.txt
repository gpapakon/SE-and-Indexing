<ABSTRACT>
A wiper blade (1), in particular for a motor vehicle, has a supporting frame (7) with at least one bow (2-4). A wiper strip (8) is attached releasably to the bow (2-4). At least one wind-directing element (9) is assigned to the wiper blade. In order, in a constructively simple and cost-effective manner, to reduce the pressure acting on the wiper blade (1) due to wind flow and/or the flow of water, and to prevent the wiper strip (8) from lifting off a windscreen, the wind-guiding element (9) is formed with a number of guiding channels (10). Each guiding channel (10) has an entry end (11) at the front and an exit end (12), pointing towards the wiper strip, at the rear. The entry end (11) and exit end (12) are offset with respect to each other in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade (1).

Wiper blade (1), in particular for automotive
vehicles, comprising a supporting structure (7)

including at least one bridge (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), a wiper
blade rubber (8) detachably fixed to said bridge, and

at least one wind-guiding element (9) allocated to
said wiper blade (1), 
characterized in
 that said wind-guiding
element (9) is formed with a plurality of

guiding channels (10) which comprise each an inlet end
(11) at the front side and an outlet end (12) which is

provided at the rear side and faces said wiper blade
rubber (8), with inlet and outlet ends being displaced

relative to one another in the longitudinal direction
(13) of said wiper blade (1).
A wiper blade 1 according to claim 1 comprising
a main bridge, at least two intermediate bridges

and/or at least two link bridges (2; 3, 4; 5, 6),

characterized in
 that said wind-guiding element (9) is
allocated to at least one link bridge (5, 6) and/or

intermediate bridge.
Wiper blade according to claim 2, 
characterized in

that wind-guiding element (9) and link bridge (5, 6)
are integrally formed.
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said wind-guiding
element (9) includes a wind-guiding surface (14) above

said guiding channels (10), said wind-guiding surface
extending substantially in parallel with said wiper

blade rubber (8). 
Wiper blade according to at least one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that said guiding
channel (10) is open at its side opposite to said

wind-guiding surface (14).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said guiding channel
(10) has a a substantially U-shaped cross-section.
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said guiding channel
(10) takes a curved course between inlet and outlet

ends (11, 12).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, with said wiper blade being hinged to a free

end (15) of a wiper arm (16) that is reciprocatingly
movable, 
characterized in
 that said outlet end (12) is
displaced relative to said inlet end (11) towards an

end (17) of said wiper blade (1) which faces away from
said wiper arm (16).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said guiding channel
(10) is defined by two side walls (18; 19) that extend

between inlet and outlet ends (11, 12).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said side walls (18, 19)
project in a substantially vertical direction

downwards from said wind-guiding surface (14) and have
a height (20) increasing towards said outlet end (12).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said side walls (18; 19)
that define a guiding channel (10) have different

radii of curvature (21, 22). 
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that adjacent guiding
channels (10) are separated by a side wall (18), the

lateral surfaces (23, 24) thereof which define the
respective guiding channel having different radii of

curvature (21, 22).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said side wall (18) has
a wall thickness (25) decreasing towards said inlet

end (11).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said side walls (18, 19)
of each guiding channel (10) are separately formed and

adjacent side walls of neighboring guiding channels
are interconnected by a front wall (26) at least at

said inlet ends (11).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said front wall (26)
extends substantially in parallel with the

longitudinal direction (27) of said wind-guiding
element (9).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that front wall (26) and side
walls (18, 19) have the same height (20, 28) in the

zone of said inlet end (11).
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that said side wall (18, 19)
extends in a straight line downwards towards said

outlet end at its end facing the open side of said
guiding channel (10). 
Wiper blade according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in
 that link bridges (5, 6) and
wind-guiding element (9) are connected to each other
