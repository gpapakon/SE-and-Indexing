<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a process for the thermal recycling of waste PVC with the recovery of heat and anhydrous hydrogen chloride, in which: a) the waste PVC is burned in the presence of oxygen, and as much gaseous chlorine and/or chlorinated hydrocarbons are added to the combustion substance that, together with the hydrogen or chlorine content of the substance, there is in the mixture a total atomic ratio of hydrogen to chlorine of at least 1:1; b) the combustion gas is cooled to 500 to 1000  C, possibly after filtration, with the recovery of a major proportion of the heat of combustion released; c) said gas is cooled to 50 to 120  C by injection of aqueous hydrochloric acid in which the hydrogen chloride content corresponds to the saturation concentration at the prevailing pressures and temperatures, the major proportion of the water of combustion being condensed out, and solids precipitated from the aqueous hydrochloric acid being filtered out by the hydrolysis of volatile inorganic compounds; d) the combustion gas is further cooled to temperatures of -5 to +10  C by direct heat exchange, the residual water being condensed out as hydrochloric acid; and e) the largely anhydrous, hydrogen chloride-containing combustion gas is transferred for further use.

Process for the thermal recycling of waste PVC 
with recovery of heat and anhydrous hydrogen chloride, 

characterized in that 

a) the waste PVC is burnt in the presence of oxygen, 
sufficient gaseous chlorine and/or chlorinated 

hydrocarbons being added to the combustion material 
so that, together with the hydrogen content and 

chlorine content of the combustion material, a total 
atomic ratio of hydrogen to chlorine is present in 

the mixture of at least 1:1, 
b) the combustion gas is cooled to 500 to 1000째C with 
recovery of a large part of the heat of combustion 

released and, if appropriate after filtration, 
c) is cooled to 50 to 120째C by injection of aqueous 
hydrochloric acid whose hydrogen chloride concentration 

corresponds to the saturation concentration at 
the prevailing pressures and temperatures, the 

majority of the resulting water of combustion being 
condensed out and by hydrolysis of volatile inorganic 

compounds any solid precipitates occurring 
being filtered off from the aqueous hydrochloric 

acid, 
d) the combustion gas is further cooled by direct heat 
exchange to temperatures of -5 to +10째C, residual 

water being condensed out as hydrochloric acid and 
e) the substantially anhydrous hydrogen chloride-containing 
combustion gas is fed to further use. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the waste PVC is reacted at gauge pressures of 3 to 

15 bar with an oxygen source which contains more than 90% 
by volume of molecular oxygen. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the combustion proceeds at a flame temperature of 

2000 to 2500째C and a residence time of the mixture in the 
combustion chamber of 30 to 60 seconds. 
Process according to Claim 1 to 3, characterized 
in that gaseous chlorine and/or highly chlorinated 

hydrocarbons are admixed in quantities such that together  
 

with the hydrogen content and chlorine content of the 
combustion material, a total atomic ratio of hydrogen to 

chlorine in the mixture of 1.0:1 to 2.0:1 results. 
Process according to Claim 1 to 4, characterized

high that the combustion gas leaving the combustion 
chamber has a chlorine content of 0.2 to 2.0% by volume. 
Process according to Claim 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the cooling is carried out in step b) by indirect 

cooling by means of heat exchange with hot water of
