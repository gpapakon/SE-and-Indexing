oil circuit and a pilot oil circuit. The main circuit 

includes a main pump (13) a main valve (12) downstream 
from said main pump and a hydraulic actuator (11) 

downstream from said main valve. The pilot oil 
circuit circulates pressurized pilot oil to control 

the main valve. The pilot oil circuit includes a

manual control switching valve. The pilot oil chamber 

is located near the main valve (12) such that the flow 
of pressurized pilot oil moves the main valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve control
unit for hydraulic actuators used in machinery such as
construction equipment.Some valve control units for hydraulic actuators
are equipped with an automatic-control switching valve
for automatically controlling a main valve and a
manual-control switching valve for manually controlling
the main valve. Both the automatic control switching
valve and the manual control switching valve are
connected to a hydraulic pilot oil circuit between a
pilot pump and a pilot chamber of the main valve. The
pilot oil circuit supplies pressurized pilot oil to the
pilot chamber in order to automatically and manually
control the main valve that drives the hydraulic
actuator. While manually controlling the manual-control
switching valve in such a valve control unit, however, an
operator may not detect that the hydraulic actuator has
reached its a predetermined limit state position (i.e.,
the hydraulic actuator is either fully extended or fully
retracted), but because manual control continues,
pressurized oil continues to be supplied to the main
valve.In view of this problem, a limit state
switching valve can be provided to switch a pilot
hydraulic passage closed in order to stop the flow of 
pressurized oil to the main valve the hydraulic actuator
reaches the predetermined limit state.The hydraulic circuit of a conventional valve
control unit, as shown in Fig. 12 which represents an in-house state of the
art, includes a main pump 51, a pilot
pump 52, a power source (driving mechanism) 53 that
drives the main pump 51 and the pilot pump 52, an
actuator (hydraulic cylinder) 54, a main valve 55
disposed in a main hydraulic circuit between the main
pump 51 and the actuator 54, a stroke sensor 56 for
detecting the length that the actuator 54 extends or
retracts, a control section 57, an automatic-control
switching valve 58, 59 that is switched according to the
automation control command of the control section 57, a
manual-control switching valve 60, an oil reservoir 61,
and a manual-operation detection sensor 62 for detecting
when the manual-control switching valve 60 is operating.In the case of the conventional valve control unit,
limit state switching valves 63, 64 are disposed in the
pilot oil passage between the manual-switching valve 60
and each pilot chamber 55a, 55b of the main valve 55 in
order to stop pressurized oil from being further supplied
to the main valve by switching the main valve according
to a control command once the actuator 54 is detected to
have reached
