<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a lawn 
protecting method for preventing a lawn from being 

barren by stamping pressure, particularly relates to a 
lawn protecting method in golf courses, tennis courts, 

sports stadiums such as soccer fields and an elastic 
body for lawn protection used therefor. The present 

invention is a lawn protecting method comprising 
dispersing fragmental elastic bodies of not less than 

0.0003 cm³ and not more than 5 cm³ in volume on a lawn or 

previously sowed soil, and cultivating turf. Moreover, 
an elastic body for lawn protection according to the 

present invention consists of rubber, synthetic resin or 
their sponge, its cross section is circular, oval, 

annular, spherical, polygonal and their amorphous shape, 
and its volume is 0.0003-5 cm³.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lawn
protecting method for preventing a lawn from the naked
ground by stamping pressure, particularly, relates to a
lawn protecting method and an elastic body for lawn
protection used therefor in golf course, tennis courts,
sports stadiums and the like.The Japanese lawn grass is mainly transplanted
and grown in sports stadiums such as golf links, soccer
fields and the like, or grounds such as parks and the
like, but barren grassy lawns have becomes a problem
caused by damaging grass when there are many players or
a game is hard. For preventing a lawn from becoming
barren so far, there was a method of installing a porous
plastic or rubber mat on a grass lot, growing lawns from
pores, and softening a stamping pressure without directly
stamping the grass lot, or preventing grass from wearing
out by a thickness of the mat.However, these prior goods have not been used 
for soccer field, tennis court or golf course because
there are many problems such that a player's foot is
caught in a mat when he tries to perform sliding in hard
sports such as soccer, tennis and the like. Therefore,
many grassy lawns used for sports, particularly golf
courses, soccer fields and tennis court limit the
numbers of players, reduce the number of games or provide
suitable recess for growing grass, so that many people
had difficulty to sufficiently utilize grassy lawns.Moreover, in case of striking a ball at the
teeing ground of a golf course, a club is caught in a
mat and cannot be gotten free.Furthermore, in care of regrowing a grassy lawn,
even if lawn leave are mowed or worn out, the grassy
lawn can regrow as far as lawn buds are healthy, but in
case of destroying lawn buds, grass cannot regrow from
the same place but germinates from a neighbor node or a
node of the straight stem root. In case of using for
hard sports such as soccer and tennis, even lawn buds
are often destroyed, and in this case, it takes
considerable time for germination again and it is
necessary to keep off the grass for a long period of
time in order to grow grass.Therefore, it is not only necessary to prevent
the whole grass from wearing out, but also necessary to
improve utilization of a grassy lawn by quickening the 
regrowthing time of grass from wearing out, so that any
wearing out should be stopped at the leaf portion, and
the germinating foot portion should be protected.Document US-A-5 014 462 also describes a method for protecting
a lawn from destruction by e.g., playing or sliding thereon. However,
although
