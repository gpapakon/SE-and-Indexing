<ABSTRACT>
This signalling light is intended for a motor vehicle comprising a window (14) and a device for washing this window, the device being equipped with a nozzle (60) supplied with washing liquid. The signalling light includes a translucent wall (26) and is intended to be arranged close to the window (14). The nozzle (60) comprises a head (62) for spraying washing liquid, this head being arranged in a housing (64) formed in the translucent wall (26). For preference, the light includes a casing (22) delimited in part by the translucent wall (26), the head (62) being connected to a washer liquid circuit by a connection duct (66) formed integrally with a wall (72) of the casing opposite the translucent wall (26).

A warning light for a motor vehicle comprising a glass pane 
(14) and a device for washing this glass pane, provided with a 

jet (60) supplied with washing liquid, the warning light comprising 
a translucent wall (26) and being intended to be arranged 

in the vicinity of the glass pane (14), characterized in 
that the jet (60) comprises a nozzle (62) for spraying the washing 

liquid, disposed in a recess (64) arranged in the translucent 
wall (26). 
A warning light according to claim 1, characterized in that 
it comprises a casing (22) partly delimited by the translucent 

wall (26), and in that the nozzle (62) is connected to a circuit 
of washing liquid through a connecting duct (66) obtained integrally 

with a wall (72) of the casing (22) on the opposite side 
to the translucent wall (26). 
A warning light according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the casing (22) comprises a body (24) assembled with the translucent 

wall (26), the duct (66) being integral with this body 
(24) and the nozzle (62) being held in position in the recess 

(64) of the translucent wall (26) by a tight fit between the 
edge of this recess and one end of the duct (66) connected to 

the nozzle (62). 
A warning light according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the duct (66) has a median plane (P) of the light as its plane 

of longitudinal symmetry, so as to extend between the two halves 
of this light, each comprising an equal number of light sources 

(52). 
A warning light according to claims 3 and 4 taken together, 
characterized in that the body (24) and the translucent wall 

(26) of the casing (22) comprise contiguous edges (24A, 26A) 
welded together, delimiting a median compartment (42) of the  

 
casing wherein there extends the duct (66), and two side compartments 

(44, 46) wherein the light sources (52) are disposed. 
A warning light according to claim 4, characterized in that 
one row (R1, R2) of electroluminescent diodes (52) is disposed 

in each of the said halves of the light, these rows (R1, R2) 
being disposed symmetrically relative to the median plane (P) 

separating the said halves of the light. 
A warning light according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the electroluminescent diodes (52) of each row (R1, R2) are interspaced 

from each other along a constant pitch, the spacing 
between the two electroluminescent diodes of these two rows 

which are closest being substantially equal to twice the pitch 

of the rows. 
A warning light according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the translucent wall (26) is substantially 

perpendicular to the glass pane (14) towards which the jet (60) 
is orientated.
