<ABSTRACT>
The insulated enclosure (1) for conservation and transport comprises a carbon dioxide snow container (2) provided with a lateral opening (5) allowing pressurised liquid CO2 to be injected into the container by means of a distributor (10) connected to a liquid CO2 source (6), the distributor means being fitted with a solenoid valve (18) controlled by a control unit (19) comprising timer means allowing the duration of injection of liquid CO2 into the container (2) to be selected in order to form therein a metered reserve of carbon dioxide snow. Application to the conservation and transport of fresh food products as frozen food products.

Reserve tank for carbon dioxide snow designed to be
disposed inside an insulated chamber (1) for preserving

products, being in the form of a closed box (2) comprising
an upper wall (20) provided with at least one opening (26)

and a front lateral face (21) traversed by an end piece
(50) connected to at least one injector (23) disposed in

the box and designed to connect the injector to a circuit
(9) for leading in liquid CO
2
 under pressure, the said tank
having a generally parallelepiped-shaped configuration, the

injector (23) being disposed in the vicinity of one lateral
face (22) of the tank (2) and having at least one ejection

orifice (24) oriented so as to direct a jet of liquid CO
2

towards the inside of the tank, characterized in that it
comprises a deflector (25) associated with the injector

(23), the ejection orifice (24) being oriented so as to
direct the jet of liquid CO
2
 towards the deflector (25), and
in that the upper wall (20) comprises a first solid part

(20A) covering the zone of the injector (23), the orifice
(24) being directed towards the lower wall of the box, and

the deflector (25) being arranged so as to return the jet
of liquid CO
2
 towards the first solid part (20A) of the
upper wall (20).
Tank according to claim 1, characterized in that the
opening (26) in the upper wall (20) is covered with a mesh.
Portable insulated chamber comprising a tank according
to either of claims 1 or 2, mounted permanently inside the

chamber (1).
Chamber according to claim 3, characterized in that it
comprises, between the tank (2) and an internal volume for

loading products (3), a detachable heat shield (4). 
Chamber according to claim 4, characterized in that it
comprises a lateral opening which can be closed, giving

access to the internal volume and to the tank (2).
