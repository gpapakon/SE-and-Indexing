<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a simulator of predominantly magnetic fields, and the application of this simulator to trials of electrical or electronic equipment items. The principle of operation of the simulator according to the invention is based on the discharge of a capacitor (1) into an inductor (2). A resistor (8) of value R makes it possible to choose the mode of discharge of the capacitor (1) between a damped sinusoidal mode and an aperiodic mode. According to the invention, the inductor is formed by at least one plate of conducting material bent into a U shape, the extremities of the branches of the U being connected to the terminals of the capacitor. The width and length dimensions of the plate fix the value L of the inductance, and are chosen moreover in such a way as to create a confinement volume in which a predominantly magnetic field is generated. The simulator according to the invention makes it possible easily to vary the characteristics of the magnetic field generated, particularly by adjusting the R, L and C values. It may be used particularly to simulate the magnetic fields generated by large-sized metallic structures subjected to electromagnetic pulses, and to try out equipment intended to be carried by these structures.
