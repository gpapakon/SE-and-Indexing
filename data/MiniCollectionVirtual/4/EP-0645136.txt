<ABSTRACT>
A prolonged releasing pharmaceutical preparation 
is provided carrying a physiologically active substance, 

particularly, calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) or a maxadilan (MAX). This pharmaceutical preparation 

can attain the expected effects by incorpolating 
the physiologically active substance into a combination, 

as carriers for the physiologically active substance, of 
a cellulosic polymer and at least one auxiliary component 

selected from the group consisting of fats and oils, 
waxes, fatty acids, saccharides and polyacrylate ester 

derivatives. The pharmaceutical preparation can conveniently 
be used, in living bodies, particularly as an 

intrathecal implantation-type preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical 
preparation capable of prolonged releasing a physiologically 
active substance in a controlled state. The pharmaceutical 
preparation is, particularly, directed to 
physiologically active peptides such as calcitonin gene-related 
peptide (CGRP) and maxadilans (MAXs). The pharmaceutical 
preparation of the invention is useful as an 
intracorporeal implantation-type, particularly intrathecal 
implantation-type physiologically active substance-prolonged 
releasing preparation. Prolonged releasing (hereinafter, the same as 
gradually or delayed releasing) preparations, wherein 
when the drugs or physiologically active substances are 
administered into living bodies, elution of the drugs in 
the living bodies is controlled and their absorption is 
adjusted, have been investigated from long ago. For 
example, a method which comprises coating drugs with 
various coats, a method which comprises incorporating 
drugs into matrices of waxes or macromolecules, etc. have 
been known. However, when intrathecal diseases are treated, 
in the case of intravenous administration of physiologically 
active substances, migration of these physiologically 
active substances into the brains is prevented by 
the blood brain barriers. As a method for direct administration 
of a physiologically active substance into 
brains, there is a method which comprises seating a 
catheter at the time of the operation and gradually 
supplying the drug into the brain, but since the apparatus 
is expensive and in addition there is a large  
 
danger of infection, it is hard to say that the method is 
a reliable method. For example, in delayed cerebral 
vasospasm occurring after subarachnoid hemorrhage, the 
pathosis is retardingly manifested and moreover is lasting, 
and thus a method which comprises inserting a catheter 
for administration of drugs and a method which comprises 
continuously administering a drug into the vein 
are used. However, it is the present state of things 
that a method for obtaining sure therapeutic effects has 
not yet been developed. When one's eyes are turned to physiologically 
active peptides, particularly calcitonin gene-related 
peptide (CGRP) and maxadilans (MAXs) about which the 
present inventors have contemplated development of pharmaceutical 
preparations effective for various diseases, 
prolonged releasing pharmaceutical preparations for 
active substances specifically effective in relation to 
targeted diseases have not been proposed. When CGRP and 
maxadilans
