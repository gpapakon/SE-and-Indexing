<ABSTRACT>
In the method proposed, a flow of signal cells being transferred through virtual junctions in an asynchronous-transfer mode is forwarded along a multiplicity of parallel junction lines. Successive cells are distributed on to the junction lines cyclically with a fixed time offset. On reception of the cells, the junction lines are interrogated cyclically in the same sequence with a time offset which is shorter than that with which successive cells are distributed on to the junction lines.

Method for forwarding a stream of message cells 
via a plurality of parallel trunks (VL), in which 


the stream of message cells carries message cells of 
fixed length in the course of an asynchronous transmission 

method, 
the transport rate of the stream of message cells is 
higher than the transport rate of an individual 

trunk, 
successive message cells of the stream of message 
cells are distributed cyclically over the plurality 

of trunks and are forwarded, 
 
characterized in that 


the successive message cells are chronologically 
offset relative to one another, 
the trunks are cyclically interrogated in the same 
direction during the reception of the message cells, 

in which case, during the cyclical interrogation of 
successive trunks, 


a) the offset is shorter than the offset with which 
successive message cells are forwarded, and 
b) the chronological interval between the start of 
two successive interrogation cycles is shorter 

than the duration of the forwarding of a message 
cell. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that successive message cells are forwarded with a 

chronological offset of a fixed duration of time. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the chronological offset with which successive 

message cells are forwarded is a fraction of the duration  
 

of the forwarding of a message cell. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the fraction is equal to the proportion formed by a 

trunk of the total number of the plurality of trunks. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the fraction is smaller than the proportion formed 

by a trunk of the total number of the plurality of 
trunks. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, when message cells are received in 

a switching element, the trunks are interrogated with a 
chronological offset which is equal to the chronological 

interval with which message cells of successively interrogated 
trunks can be written into a central memory in 

the switching element. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that, when a message cell arrives 
from a trunk, an arrival flag is set in a reception 

device, and the arrival flag which has been set is reset 
when the trunk is interrogated. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that for forwarding message cells from 

a switching element (SE) onto a bundle of trunks, the 
designations of these message cells are entered into a 

queue associated with the bundle, and the message cells 
are cyclically forwarded onto the trunks of this bundle 

in accordance with the sequence of the designations in 
the queue. 
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the designations of message cells which are to be 

forwarded onto a bundle of successive trunks are entered 
into the queue which is associated with the trunk and 

whose designation is derived by masking the least 
significant binary character of the queue designation 

which is expressed in binary form.
