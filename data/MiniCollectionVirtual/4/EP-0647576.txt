<ABSTRACT>
Known computer-assisted stores and commissioning systems, in terms of their structural shape, capacity and access times, are too large and inflexible and too slow for the movement of large quantities. A commissioning installation with an input zone, a conveying-material transport apparatus, a commissioning zone and an output zone is proposed, in which the commissioning zone has a multiplicity of commissioning modules (1) arranged along the conveying-material transport apparatus. The commissioning modules (1) each comprise a multiplicity of stack stores with fully sorted stacks (3) and an intelligent handling system. Each stack store has at least two fully sorted stacks (3) arranged one above the other and separated by intermediate plates (4). The handling system recognises the intermediate plates (4) and can consequently differentiate between stacks (3) having different sorts. The stack stores allow a high packing density and therefore an extremely compact storage system. The commissioning installation according to the invention is particularly suitable for compact discs and similarly flat stackable goods.
