<ABSTRACT>
The invention makes use of a certain compartmental model to relate various measurement data from a patient to these compartments which in turn enable conclusions about the hydration and/or nutrition status of the patient to be drawn. According to the invention a method is provided for determining the volume ECVhydr(t) of a body compartment of a patient at a time t comprising the steps of determining at least one anthropometric measure X(t) of the patient at the time t, determining the extracellular water volume ECV(t) of the patient at the time t, determining the intracellular water volume ICV(t) of the patient at the time t, deriving the extracellular water volume ECVbasic(t) of a first compartment with weight Wbasic(t) of the patient at the time t by using X(t), deriving the extracellular water volume ECVsec(t) of a second compartment of the patient at the time t by using ICV(t), and deriving ECVhydr(t) as the extracellular water volume of a third compartment of the patient with weight Whydr(t). The extracellular volume ECVhydr(t) is a measure for the hydration status of the patient. A device for carrying out the method according to the invention is also part of the invention. The invention is particularly helpful in the dry weight management of a patient suffering from renal failure. Information on other body tissue compartments like muscle and/or fat may also be derived reflecting the nutrition status of a patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of monitoring the hydration and/or nutrition status of a patient.The kidneys carry out several functions for maintaining the health of a human body. First, they control the fluid balance by separating any excess fluid from the patient's blood volume. Second, they serve to purify the blood from any waste substances like urea or creatinine. Last not least they also control the levels of certain substances in the blood like electrolytes in order to ensure a healthy and necessary concentration level.In case of renal failure ingested fluid accumulates in body tissues and the vascular system causing increased stress on the circulatory system. This surplus fluid has to be removed during a dialysis treatment by ultrafiltration of the blood. If insufficient fluid is removed the long term consequences can be severe, leading to high blood pressure and cardiac failure. Cardiac failure itself is many times more likely to occur in dialysis patients and it is thought that states of fluid overload are one of the major contributing factors. Removal of too much fluid is also dangerous since the dialysis patient becomes dehydrated and this invariably leads to hypotension.The dry weight (for the sake of simplicity the words "weight" and "mass" shall be used synonymously throughout this patent application document - which is usual practise in the medical field anyway) defines the weight of a patient that would be achieved if the kidneys were working normally. In other words this represents the optimal target weight (or fluid status) which should be achieved in order to minimise cardiovascular risk. Dry weight has always been an elusive problem in routine clinical practise due to lack of quantitative methods for its assessment. Currently the dry weight problem is approached using indirect indicators like e.g. blood pressure, echocardiographic investigations and subjective information such as X-rays. Furthermore it has been particularly difficult to define a set of conditions which are universally accepted as the dry weight standard.A promising method to derive the fluid status of a patient involves the use of bioimpedance measurements. A small alternating current is applied to two or more electrodes which are attached to a patient and the corresponding electric potential difference is measured. The various fluid compartments of a human body contribute differently to the measured signals. The use of multiple frequencies allows the intracellular water (ICV) and extracellular water (ECV)
