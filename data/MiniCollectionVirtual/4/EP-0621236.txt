<ABSTRACT>
Carbon fluoride particles wherein the number-average particle diameter is 0.01-50 µm, the content of particles having such 
diameters that the particle size distribution thereof falls within the range from the number-average particle diameter minus 20 % 

to the number-average particle diameter plus 20 % amounts to at least 50 % of the whole, the true specific gravity is 1.7 to 2.5, the 
F to C ratio of the particle as a whole is 0.001 to 0.5, 
and the F to C ratio at the surface of the particle is invariably greater than 
that of the particle as a whole and is 0.1 to 2.0. The carton fluoride particles can be produced by the reaction of carbon particles 

with fluorine at 350-600 °C for 1 minute to 6 hours. The obtained particles have excellent dispersibility and powder fluidity and 
are used as such or in the form of composite material as water- and oil-repellent, detackifying agent, solid lubricant, conductivity 

improver, additive for electrostatic development toner, additive for resinous coating layer of electrostatic development carrier, 
composite material for fixing roller, phosphate-type fuel cell, air/zinc battery and nickel/hydrogen storage battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel carbon fluoride particles, a
preparation process of such carbon fluoride particles, and their use for water- and
oil-repellents, non-tackifying agents, solid lubricants, agents for imparting electric
conductivity, composite materials of various forms, additives to toners and additives
to carrier coating for developing electrostatic images, fixing rollers, phosphoric acid
fuel cells, zinc/air batteries, and nickel/metal hydride batteries.Carbon fluorides can be prepared by fluorinating various carbon
powder materials, and are obtained as solid powders. Since carbon fluorides have an
extremely low surface energy and can exhibit their excellent characteristics under
severe conditions regardless of the atmospheric environment, the carbon fluorides have
been regarded as excellent industrial materials in wide technical fields such as water- and
oil-repellents, mold-releasing compounds, non-tackifying agents and solid
lubricants.When utilizing the said excellent properties of the carbon fluorides, the
carbon fluorides are generally added and dispersed into materials such as resins and
rubbers, dispersed into oils, greases, organic solvents or aqueous solutions, or used in
the form of fine particle composites with other powders rather than using the carbon
fluoride powder alone as such.However, when utilizing the above-mentioned various excellent
properties by composing the carbon fluoride powder with other materials, a problem
arises from the difficulty to disperse the powder uniformly and stable within the other 
materials, and accordingly, the desired properties are not obtained sufficiently.The reason for this problem is that commercially available common
conventional carbon fluoride particles are highly fluorinated throughout the inner
portion to provide particles which are in whole in the form of carbon fluoride. This
results in (1) the specific gravity becoming high with values in the rage from 2.5 to
3.0, and (2) the particles being broken irregularly during the fluorinating step due to
stress in the whole particle in order to produce a very wide particle size distribution
and to create irregular particle shapes (due to widening of the (001) plane of carbon
fluoride up to 0.6 - 0.9 nm in course of the fluorination process in comparison with
the (001) plane spacing of microcrystalline graphite, which is 0.34 nm). Therefore, the
wholly fluorinated carbon fluoride does not have the desired properties with regard to
dispersibility ad powder flowability.If carbon
