<ABSTRACT>
A spool (30) for a rotary cutter, such as a lawn mower 
edger or trimmer of the type using a flexible line (38) as a 

cutting member, comprises a core portion (32) and at least 
two flange portions (34), (36) spaced apart on the core 

portion (32) for supporting at least one coil of flexible 
line (38). At least one coiled line member (38) is disposed 

about the core portion (32) and has a first end (40) 
secured to the spool (30) and a second end (42) adapted to 

extend from the coiled line (38) to provide a length of line 
(12) for cutting. At least one of the flange portions (34) 

is provided with two apertures (44), (46), through which the 
line (38) can be threaded, at least one (44) of these 

apertures being in communication radially with the outside 
(50) of the flange (34) so that the line (38) can enter the 

aperture from a position radially exterior of the flange 
(34), and the line (38) is coiled with said first end (40) 

threaded through aperture (46) from the outside (52) of the 
spool (30) in a direction substantially parallel to the axis 

(A) of the spool (30), so that the end (40) is retained 
close to the core portion (32) of the spool (30), and then 

threaded through the communicating aperture (44) in the 
direction (X) of winding of the line (38). 
The aperture (44 which is in communication radially 
with the outside (50) of the flange (34) is preferably 

L-shaped.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vegetation cutters and has
particular reference to cutters that cut by means of a
filament or strip that is rotated rapidly about an axis that
may be either substantially vertical or substantially
horizontal, depending upon the application.In most filament cutters, the cutting filament or strip
is stored on a spool or reel from which a cutting length
extends. During use, wear on the cutting length shortens
that length, and it is then necessary to withdraw filament
or strip from the spool to make up the cutting length to its
working value. The filament cutter is supplied with a reel
or spool on which a supply of filament or strip is stored.In general, when the supply of filament or strip on a
reel or spool is exhausted, the empty reel or spool is
removed and a replacement reel or spool, with a new supply
of filament or strip already loaded is fitted. This is a
simple operation, which is carried out by the operator of
the vegetation cutter. The replacement reels or spools are
readily available from the usual retail sources, including
for example, retailers of the vegetation cutter itself.The cutting filament or strip is a flexible, generally
non-metallic filament or strip, in particular a light weight
plastic filament or strip, having a relatively small
diameter, which is adapted to cut or trim grass or other
lightweight vegetation with reasonable effectiveness, and
which is unlikely to cause significant injury to persons or
animals struck by the flailing filament or strip.During manufacture of the reel or spool with the supply
of cutting filament or strip wound on it, the cutting 
filament or strip has to be wound onto the empty reel or
spool, either manually or automatically. As the winding of
a length of cutting filament or strip is commenced, it is
necessary for the free end of the filament or strip to be
secured, at least temporarily, to the reel or spool before
the winding operation can be commenced.As the filament cutter is used, and the supply of
filament or strip becomes exhausted, a relatively short
length of filament is eventually left on the spool. If the
end of this short length, which is of course the free end
referred to in the preceding paragraph, is not secured to
the spool, then there is a danger that a length of filament
or strip, which might be of a similar length to the cutting
length, or may be even longer, may fly off from the cutter
head, giving the risk of injury to the operator.A number of proposals have been made to provide a means
of securing the

A spool (30) for a rotary cutter, such as a lawn mower
edger or trimmer of the type using a flexible line (38) as a

cutting member, which spool (30) comprises a core portion
(32) and at least two flange portions (34), (36) spaced

apart on the core portion (32) for supporting at least one
coil of flexible line (38), and at least one coiled line

member (38) disposed about the core portion (32) and having
a first end (40) secured to the spool (30) and a second end

(42) adapted to extend from the coiled line (38) to provide
a length of line (12) for cutting, characterised in that at

least one of the flange portions (34) is provided with two
apertures (44), (46), through which the line (38) can be

threaded, at least one (44) of these apertures being in
communication radially with the outside (50) of the flange

(34) so that the line (38) can enter said
communicating

aperture from a
position radially exterior of the flange (34), and the line

(38) is coiled with said first end (40) threaded through the other
aperture (46) from the outside (52) of the spool (30) in a

direction substantially parallel to the axis (A) of the
spool (30), so that the end of the line (40) is retained close to the

core portion (32) of the spool (30), and then threaded
through said communicating aperture (44) in the direction (X)

of winding of the line (38).
A spool according to claim 1 characterised in that the
aperture (46) is in communication with an axial groove (48)

formed in the core portion (32) of the spool (30).
A spool according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterised
in that the aperture (44) which is in communication radially

with the outside (50) of the flange (34) is L-shaped. 
rotary cutter for cutting vegetation, of the type
using a flexible line stored on a spool as a cutting member,

characterised in that the spool comprises a spool as claimed
in any of Claims 1 to 3.
A method of winding line on a spool (30) wherein the
spool (30) comprises a core portion (32) and at least two

flange portions (34), (36) spaced apart on the core portion
(32) for supporting at least one coil of flexible line (38),

characterised in that at least one of the flange portions
