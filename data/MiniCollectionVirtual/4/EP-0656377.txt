<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tapered block copolymers of
monovinylarenes and conjugated dienes and methods of preparation of
these tapered block copolymers.There has developed in the polymer field, and especially in
the packaging and related industries, a need for thermoplastic polymers
that can be formed into transparent articles having high impact strength
with good environmental stress crack resistance. There are needs for
polymers which are useful as single components as well as for use in
blends to improve properties of articles made from other commonly used
polymers. The polymers satisfying these needs should be suitable for
use with conventional extrusion, injection and blow molding equipment
and also suitable for use in other methods of forming plastics into
containers, tubes, films, fibers, And the like. Polystyrene, high 
impact polystyrene, branched block copolymers, and the like have been
developed to meet these criteria with various degrees of satisfaction.Much effort has been directed to the preparation of
substantially transparent block copolymer resins with a variety of block
structures produced by a variety of monomer addition sequences and a
variety of coupling agents.Polymerization of styrene and butadiene with organolithium
initiators to produce block copolymers in which one or more
non-elastomeric polymer blocks are bonded to one or more elastomeric
polymer blocks has been disclosed. Block copolymers have been formed by
sequential charges of the monomers, sometimes followed by introduction
of one or more coupling agents into the reaction. Tapered blocks in
styrene/butadiene block copolymers have been prepared by simultaneous
charging of monomers to the polymerization zone. Literally thousands of
various combinations of sequences of charges of monomers and coupling
agents are possible. As an example, such tapered block copolymers have been described in EP-A-0 255 001 and EP-A-0 512 530.One problem encountered in making monovinylaromatic-conjugated
diene block copolymers is control of the exothermic reaction
temperatures and pressure which can rapidly reach high peaks if large
monomer charges are made in order to produce large blocks in the
copolymers.It is an object of this invention to provide improved resinous
tapered block copolymers of vinyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons and
conjugated dienes which can he used neat or in blends to make articles 
with improved environmental stress crack resistance and good impact
strength. The copolymers comprise 55 to 95 wt.-% of a monovinyl
