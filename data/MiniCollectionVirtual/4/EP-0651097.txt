<ABSTRACT>
Device for assembling parallel and spaced bars to a rail for supporting these bars, extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of these bars, characterised in that the rail (6, 7, 11) includes a plurality of neighbouring openings (13, 36), preferably equidistant, each of which can receive the end of one bar (8), and a flexible internal tongue (15) fitted into the internal wall of the rail, extending over the entire length of this rail and having a plane surface which is inclined to the vertical and can cooperate, for each bar, with a notch (21) defined by edges (22), which are also inclined and have the same profile as the tongue, and are provided on the end of the bar which penetrates into the corresponding opening in the rail, or else arranged in a support member (27) carried by this end of the bar, the tongue including a transverse return (16) which is substantially perpendicular to its plane, capable of progressively engaging in on open housing (23) provided in the bottom of the notch, until it clicks into this housing so as to connect the rail to the bar.

Assembly of parallel and spaced-apart balusters
to a rail for supporting these balusters, extending

transversely to the longitudinal direction of the latter,
characterized in that the rail (6, 7, 11) includes a

plurality of adjacent openings (13, 36), preferably
equally spaced and each suitable for accommodating the

end of a baluster (8), and a flexible internal strip (15)
embedded in the inner wall of the rail, extending over

the entire length of the latter and having a plane
surface inclined to the vertical, capable, for each

baluster, of acting in conjunction with a recess (21)
delimited by edges (22), these also being inclined and

having the same profile as the strip, which are provided
at the end of the baluster which enters the corresponding

opening in the rail, or in the opening made in a support
member (27) carried by this end of the baluster, the

strip including a transverse return (16), substantially
perpendicular to its plane, capable of being

progressively engaged in an open housing (23) provided in
the bottom of the recess until it snaps into this

housing, fastening the rail and baluster together.
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the strip (15) includes, at the end of its

transverse return (16), a foot (17) for bearing against
the bottom of the housing (23) in the recess (21) at the

end of snap-in travel, suitable for making the strip work
in tension in the event of the baluster being bent due to

the effect of an accidental transverse blow (Figure 6).
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the rail (6, 7, 11) includes, in the vicinity of its

junction with the strip, an internal stop (20) limiting
the extent of engagement of the baluster into the rail.
Assembly according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the inclined edges (22) of the

recess (21) have, in the vicinity of the end of the
baluster (8), a projection (24) preferably forming a

point of bearing close to the region of embedment of the
strip (15) so as to stiffen the rail and baluster

assembly in the event of an accidental transverse blow
to the latter.
Assembly according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
in which the vertical balusters (8) are linked to two

rails (6 and 7, 11), respectively a top rail and bottom
rail, extending horizontally, characterized in that the

openings (13) made in these rails, accommodating the ends
of the balusters, have a profile which corresponds

exactly with the cross-section of these balusters, with
only sufficient clearance for the engagement of these

into the rail.
Assembly according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
in which each of the two rails (6 and 7, 11) makes a

given angle with the vertical direction of the balusters
(8), characterized in that each of the openings (36) made

in the rails has a cross-section significantly greater
than that of the baluster which engages therein, the

latter being solely retained in the central part of the
opening by an internal rib (35) for bearing on the

external wall of this baluster, guiding it as its end
engages in the opening and guaranteeing the spacing of

one baluster to another along the length of the rail.
Assembly according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the support member carried by each vertical baluster

(8), provided with the recess (21) acting in conjunction
with the strip (15) of the rail (6, 7, 11), has the shape

of a cylindrical stud (27), the axis of which lies
horizontally, this stud being mounted so as to pivot to

some extent about this axis inside the baluster.
Assembly according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the cylindrical stud (27) includes a front end (28)

whose cross-section, having a diamond-shaped profile, is
engaged in a groove or slot (29) in the baluster (8)

extending from its end, the stud coming at most into
abutment against the sides of this slot and tolerating

the relative excursions of the rail (6, 7, 11), fastened
to the stud, with respect to the baluster.
