<ABSTRACT>
A photochromic article comprises a transparent 
matrix composed of a material selected from acrylic 

resins and urethane resins, a first photochromic compound 
dispersed in the matrix and consisting of a composition 

selected from chromene derivatives, a second photochromic 
compound dispersed in the matrix and consisting of a 

composition selected from fulgide or fulgimide compounds, 
and a dye for coloring the matrix. The dye is adopted 

to color the matrix either in the color developed by a 
photochromic compound, with the fastest color fading 

speed, among the photochromic compounds, or the 
complementary color of the color developed by a 

photochromic compound, with the slowest color fading 
speed, among the photochromic compounds, or the mixed 

color of the colors developed by all of the photochromic 
compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photochromic 
article containing plural photochromic compounds. Photochromism is a phenomenon of reversible 
color change in certain compounds, characterized by 
rapid color change when irradiated with ultraviolet-containing 
light such as solar light or light from a 
mercury lamp and returning to the original color when 
the light irradiation is terminated. Compounds with 
such property are called photochromic compounds, and 
are recently investigated for various applications such 
as recording materials, optical elements for example an 
optical shutter, photochromic glass or eyeglass lenses. The photochromic compounds are individually used 
in most cases, but mixing of two or more photochromic 
compounds, for increasing the freedom in the developed 
color, is being investigated. Particularly in 
photochromic plastic lenses, there are required certain 
particular colors such as gray, amber or brown, and 
the use of plural photochromic compounds is disclosed 
for example in the Japanese Patent Laid-open Application 
Nos. 3-252493 and 3-282445. It has been revealed, however, that the mixed  
 
used of two or more photochromic compounds results in a 
drawback of variation in color, because the time from 
the start of light irradiation to color development and 
the time from the termination of light irradiation to 
color fading vary from compound to compound. More 
specifically, in case of mixing two or more photochromic 
compounds, the desired mixed color is obtained when both 
compounds are in the color-developed state, but, in the 
course of color development, there at first develops the 
color of a compound with the faster color developing 
speed, and in the color fading phase, there remains 
the color developed by a compound with the slower color 
fading speed. Consequently, in the color developing 
and fading phases, there cannot be obtained the desired 
mixed color, but only obtained is one of the colors 
constituting the mixed color. Such drawback of showing a color different from 
the desired mixed color in the color developing and 
fading phases is particularly conspicuous in the latter, 
because the color fading speed varies more significantly 
than the color developing speed among different 
photochromic compounds. For example, according to the 
description of the Japanese Patent Laid-open Application 
Nos. 2-69471, 3-281689 and 3-95184 which respectively 
disclose the color fading speed (time required for the 
absorbance to reach 1/2 after light irradiation
