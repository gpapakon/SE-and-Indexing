<ABSTRACT>
A hingeless assembly for a protective enclosure is 
incorporated as part of a modular display system. The 

protective enclosure (10) features a main frame (11) and an 
open face panel frame (22). While the main frame (11) and the 

open face panel frame (22) are assembled from standardized 
extrusions and joints (20), an elongated cylindrical bead (13) 

along one of the external edges of the main frame (11) and a 
semi-cylindrical elongated groove (25) along a corresponding 

edge of the open face panel frame (22) are slidably fitted 
over one another to form a modular enclosure. A gasket is 

disposed along the hingeless assembly to weather-proof the 
enclosure (10). The hingeless assembly of the enclosure (10) 

not only allows the open face panel to be opened for easy 
access, but also seals the interior of the display system from 

the elements when the open face panel is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display system and in 
particular to a display system for receiving a replaceable display 
panel supported by an enclosure as part of a modular display 
system. It is often necessary to provide protective enclosures for display 
systems such as office directories or commercial signages. 
However, the requirements in terms of geometric configurations 
for such enclosures are so varied such that mass production of 
enclosures are hitherto not economical. As the contents of the 
display systems require frequent updating, the ideal enclosure 
should be light and versatile to permit easy access to the 
display system. Yet exposure of the display systems to the 
elements generally require the protective enclosures to be 
sturdy, durable and weather-proof. Prior art hingeless assembly for a display system addresses 
partially the requirements of a modular display system that is 
economical, durable and versatile. U. S. Patent No. 4,968,171 
teaches a hingeless extrusion which combines with other 
hingeless extrusion to form a multiple positionable, self-standing 
modular display system. US Patent No. 4,873,776 discloses a hinged illuminated sign 
comprising a main frame and two panel frames for receiving a 
replaceable display panel. In order to update the display panel it 
is necessary to loosen a number of screws and other parts of 
the sign, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, the problem to 
be solved by the present invention is to provide for a display 
system that allows frequent updating in an easier way.  
 This problem is solved by a display system according to claim 
1. The present invention discloses a display system with a 
protective enclosure incorporated as part of a modular display 
system. The protective enclosure features a main frame and an 
open face panel frame. While the main frame and the open face 
panel frame are assembled from standardized extrusions and 
joints, an elongated cylindrical bead along one of the external 
edges of the main frame and a semi-cylindrical elongated 
groove along a corresponding edge of the open face panel 
frame are slidably fitted over one another to form a modular 
enclosure. The slot formed between the flange and the interior 
edge is provided for receiving one section of the display panel 
to be updated frequently. The frames of the enclosures are 
easily assembled and disassembled in view of a plurality of 
joints. A gasket is disposed along the hingeless assembly to 
weather-proof the enclosure. The hingeless

A display system for receiving a replaceable display 
panel supported by an enclosure (10) comprising: 


a main frame (11), said main frame further 
comprising at least a top main frame member (12), a 

bottom main frame member (14) and a pair of side main 
frame members (16, 18); 
a panel frame (22) for enclosing at least one open 
face of said enclosure (10), said panel frame (22) further 

comprising at least a top panel frame member (24), a 
bottom panel frame member (26) and a pair of side 

panel frame members (28, 30); 
a hingeless assembly having an elongated 
cylindrical bead (13) extending from any one of the 

external edges of said main frame members (12), said 
hingeless assembly further having an elongated semi-cylindrical 

groove (25) extending from any one of the 
edges facing said external edges of said main frame 

members (12), said groove (25) being slidably fitted with 
said bead (13); 
such that said panel frame (21) rotates around an 
axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of said bead (13), 
 
whereby
 
   the top panel frame member (24) is formed with 

a groove between a flange (21) and an interior edge (23) for 
receiving and enclosing the display panel and the 

panel frame members (24, 26, 28, 30) are detachably coupled with 
a plurality of panel frame joints (32) allowing that the 

panel frame can be easily assembled and disassembled.  
 
The display system according to claim 1 wherein said 
main frame (11) and said panel frame (22) forms a self-standing 

enclosure when said panel frame is closed over 
at least one open face of said main frame. 
The display system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein 
said groove (25) further having two extending edges 

(27, 29) for retaining said bead (13) within said groove 
(25). 
The display system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, wherein said panel frame members (24, 26, 28, 30) 

have a substantially rectangular cross-section. 
The display system as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein said main frame members (12, 14, 16, 18) are 

connected by main frame joints (20). 
The display system as claimed in claim 5, wherein said 
main frame joints (20) are rounded. 
The display system according to any preceding claim, 
wherein said panel frame joints (32) are rounded. 
The display system according to any preceding claim 
wherein said hingeless assembly further having an 

elongated gasket for tightly sealing an interface between 
the main frame (11) and said panel frame (22). 
The display system as claimed in any preceding claim 
comprising a stiffener (38) for providing a rigidity to said 

enclosure (10).
