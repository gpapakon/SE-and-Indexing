<ABSTRACT>
A liquid electrophotography fluid containment and belt tracking 
device (100) has a rubber or other elastomeric profile (101) fixed to both edges 

of a photoconducting belt (2) to provide both belt tracking control and fluid edge 
effects control. The part of the profile (101) that extends from the inside 

surface of the belt (2) is used as a tracking rail (102). A mating profile (6) is 
machined into the belt rollers (4,5) to provide tracking control. The part of the 

profile (101) that extends from the outside surface of the belt is used to seal 
the edge to the squeegee roller (12) to prevent fluid from moving around the 

end of the squeegee roller (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to electrophotography, and more
particularly, this invention relates to management and control of both a
photoconducting belt and the liquid toner applied to the belt.Two problems, which are encountered when using a belt as a
photoconductor in a liquid electrophotographic print engine, are solved by this
invention. The first problem is proper belt tracking. If a belt is placed over two
parallel rollers and rotated by means of rotating one of the rollers, the belt will
tend to move towards one end of the rollers over time. This is a fact well
recognized in the industry. This movement must be prevented or limited to
prevent the belt from moving an excessive distance from its intended position.
Many methods are used in the industry to prevent belt movement. Some of
these are crowning of the rollers, belt edge contact, dynamic steering of one of
the rollers, sprocket drive mechanisms, and tracking rails fixed to the belt that
run in grooves in the rollers. This invention makes use of the last mentioned
method.The second problem that this invention addresses is unique to
liquid electrophotography. After the liquid image is placed on the belt, a
squeegee roller is used to press off excessive toner and to press the image
tighter onto the belt surface. When using a roller that is shorter than the belt
width, the fluid being pressed ahead of the squeegee roller can escape from the
ends of the rollers. This fluid can then be pulled from the ends of the roller into
the area behind the squeegee by capillary action. This liquid ruins the image
that has been created and the lost fluid reduces the life of the consumable toner
cartridge. There is a need to control these edge effects. Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings illustrate a typical prior art belt-type
photoconductor 2 employed in electrophotographic devices such as a laser
printer 1. Figure 1 is a simplified block diagram schematic of a liquid toner laser
printer 1 having a belt-type photoconductor 2 on which four separate
developers, magenta developer 7, yellow developer 8, cyan developer 9 and
black developer 10, act to deposit toner. The first step in the color image
forming process, at least in this simplified explanation, is to deposit a charge
pattern on the photoconductor. This is accomplished by laser 11 which is
modulated by a data stream representing color separated components of a color
image. Starting with the yellow bit map first, laser 11 deposits a charge pattern
on belt 2 which represents the full page yellow
