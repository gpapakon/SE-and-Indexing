Process for dyeing polyester or polyester-containing
textile materials at pH 8 to pH 11, characterized

in that there are used one or more monoazo
dyestuffs of the general formula I



in which

A denotes 1,4-phenylene or 1,3-phenylene;
R denotes linear (C
1
-C
6
)-alkyl or (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxy-(C
2
-C
4
)-alkyl;
X
1
 denotes hydrogen or (C
1
-C
4
)-alkyl; and
X
2
 and X
3
, independently of one another, denote hydrogen
or methyl.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that A represents 1,4-phenylene.
Process according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterized
in that R denotes ethyl, n-propyl or n-butyl.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that X
1
 and one of the radicals X
2
 and
X
3
 denote methyl.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to
4, characterized in that X
2
 and X
3
 represent hydrogen and
X
1
 represents ethyl and, in particular, i-propyl.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that it is carried out under HT 

conditions in an aqueous dyeing liquor at temperatures of
between 120°C and 140°C in a dyeing autoclave.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that it is carried out at pH 9 to pH

10.
Monoazo dyestuffs of the general formula Ia


in which

A denotes 1,4-phenylene or 1,3-phenylene and
R denotes ethyl, n-propyl or n-butyl.
Process for preparing monoazo dyestuffs of the
general formula Ia according to Claim 8, characterized in

that an amine of the general formula IV


in which A is as defined in Claim 8 is diazotized in a
manner known per se, and the resulting diazonium salt is

coupled on to a hydroxypyridone of the general formula V


in which R is as defined in Claim 8.
Use of monoazo dyestuffs of the general formula
Ia according to Claim 8 for dyeing and printing

hydrophobic textile materials.
