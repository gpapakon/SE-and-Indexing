<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for non-invasive determination 
of the concentration of at least one analyte in a mammal, 

a portion of the body (31) of the mammal is 
irradiated by a radiation source (13) 

emitting two or more wavelength bands of 
near infra-red radiation. The radiation 

reflected from the portion of the body (31) is sensed 
by a spectrum analyser (21) and a value 

for the concentration of the analyte is derived by means of a date 
processor (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to techniques for non-invasively 
detecting the concentration of analytes in living animals or persons, 
and in particular to the use of infrared and near-infrared spectroscopic 
techniques for the non-invasive detection of glucose 
concentrations in the blood of humans. In the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions, 
it is important to measure the concentration of various 
constituents in the blood. For example, in the treatment of 
diabetes, the concentration of glucose in the blood must be 
measured on a periodic basis. For persons experiencing insulin-dependent 
or Type I diabetes, it is often necessary or desirable 
to measure blood glucose concentration several times each day. 
Obtaining accurate readings of cholesterol concentrations is 
important in the prevention of coronary artery disease. The 
measurement of the concentration of other blood analytes, such as 
bilirubin and alcohol, is also important for various diagnostic 
purposes.  The accurate measurement of concentrations of such 
blood constituents, as it is now practiced, requires obtaining a 
blood sample, such as by pricking a finger. The obtaining of 
blood samples by such invasive techniques is both painful and 
inconvenient. In the case of diabetics, the need to lance a 
finger several times a day to monitor glucose levels results in a 
build-up of substantial scar tissue. Indeed, many diabetics are 
believed not to monitor their glucose level as frequently as 
recommended because of the pain and inconvenience of the invasive 
method. The result of such a failure to monitor glucose levels 
is a greater risk of experiencing the long-term health effects of 
diabetes. These health effects include damage to the eyes, 
resulting in partial and often total loss of vision, and damage 
to the extremities, which can result in the need to amputate. 
Millions of individuals in the United States alone suffer from 
diabetes. As a result, the failure of individuals afflicted with 
diabetes reliably to monitor their glucose levels is a 
significant public health problem. In order to provide an alternative to the existing 
invasive blood glucose monitoring techniques, various non-invasive 
blood glucose detection techniques have been proposed. 
One of the most promising of these techniques is the non-invasive 
infrared spectroscopic technique. In this technique, a portion 
of the patient's skin is irradiated with infrared or near-infrared 
radiation. The resulting radiation that is either back-scattered
