<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for wrapping products, if appropriate supported on a pallet (10) or the like, with (1) a tubular or hood-shaped stretch foil (2, 3), especially from cubic or cuboid product stacks consisting of product layers palletised one above the other in a plurality of layers, in which method the foil portion forming the side-face wrapping is gathered and transversely stretched before being drawn over the product, and in which method the foil, when being drawn over the product, is at least temporarily pressed (12) laterally against an abutment, before the release of its lower edge portion, in the region of the lower product edge portion and/or of the pallet, and the lateral pressure is cancelled when the foil has been firmly laid over the full height against the product or at least partially against the pallet, characterised in that the foil, while being pressed down, is moved (20) inwards relative to its draw-over contour in the pressure region.

<CLAIMS>
A method of wrapping unit loads (1), which may 
or may not be supported on a pallet (10) or the like, 

with a stretch film (2, 3) in tube or hood form, more 
particularly for wrapping unit load stacks (1) of 

parallelepipedal or cubic shape consisting of palleted 
unit loads stacked one upon the other in several 

layers, that section (2, 3) of the film which forms the 
side surface wrapping being reefed and transversely 

stretched before being drawn over the unit load (1), 
while during the drawing of the film (2, 3) over the 

unit load (1) and before the release of its bottom edge 
portion it is at least temporarily pressed laterally 

against an abutment in the region of the bottom edge 
portion of the load and/or of the pallet (10) and the 

lateral pressure is removed when the film (3) has 

firmly contacted the load (1) at the full height or at 
least partially firmly contacted the pallet (10), 

characterised in that during the application of 
pressure the film (3) is moved inwardly relatively to 

its drawing-over contour in the pressure-application 
zone. 
Apparatus for wrapping unit loads (1), which 
may or may not be supported on a pallet (10) or the 

like, with a stretch film (2, 3) in tube or hood form, 
more particularly for wrapping unit load stacks (1) of 

parallelepipedal or cubic shape consisting of palleted 
unit loads stacked one upon the other in several 

layers, comprising a reefing and stretching 
reciprocating frame (9) which is adapted to be driven  

 
and which consists preferably of a plurality of bowshaped 

frame portions (9') disposed substantially in 
one (horizontal) plane and constructed to be 

substantially L or C shaped (in plan view), and bow 
supports holding each such frame portion, that portion 

(2, 3) of the film which forms the side surface 
wrapping being reefed, before being drawn over the load 

(1), on to the same by means of a reefing device 
comprising reefing rollers, the reefed film (2) being 

transversely stretched by said frame before the film is 
drawn over the unit load, the film (2, 3) being 

pressed, before the release of its bottom edge portion, 
against the unit load and/or the pallet (10) in the 

bottom zone of the unit load (1) by a pressure-application 
device (12), the latter being disengaged 

from the film when the film (2, 3) has contacted the 
bottom end portion of the unit load (1) and, where 

applicable, the top end portion of the unit load (1) 
and, where applicable, the top end portion (11) of the 

pallet (10), more particularly for performing the 
method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 

reefing rollers (12) at the same time form the 
pressure-application device (12).
