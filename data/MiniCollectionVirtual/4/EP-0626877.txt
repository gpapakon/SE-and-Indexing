<ABSTRACT>
A floating decanter apparatus useful with wastewater treatment reactors includes a funnel shaped sleeve (38) made of rubber material with its large end cooperating with a submersible suction pump (36) and its smaller opening cooperating with a ball check valve (40). The sleeve (38) is supported by a mounting frame (42). The pump (36) is attached to a flexible hose (44) and a submersible power cable (46) terminating inside a manway (56) that is located on top of a tank (11) in which the funnel shaped sleeve (38) is located.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wastewater treatment systems
and more particularly to the decanting apparatus associated
with such systems.The present invention relates to decanter systems and
in particular, to decanter systems for utilization with
wastewater treatment reactors.Certain wastewater treatment processes, especially
those utilizing sequential batch reactor techniques or
processes, require that clarified fluid be periodically
withdrawn from the reactor or digester within which the
process is occurring. Such decanters must be functional
throughout the year, even in environments where the lower
temperature extremes may form ice upon the upper layer of
the fluid within the reactor. It is also important that the
decanting system not entrain sludge during mix cycles within
the reactor or have sludge settle within the decanting
system such that when clarified liquid is withdrawn, a
certain amount of sludge is withdrawn with the liquid, as
such entrainment would discharge highly polluted effluent.One of the major problems with previous decanter
systems for use in batch reactors has been that a receiver
for the decanter has had the interior thereof open to the
fluid within the reactor during sludge mixing cycles. When 
the sludge is being mixed with the incoming effluent and the
entire reactor is in a generally mixed state, sludge is near
the top of the reactor as well as the bottom. If the
receiver is open at this time, the sludge usually enters the
receiver and settles therein during settling cycles.Thereafter, when the clarified fluid is withdrawn
through the receiver, the sludge that is within the receiver
is entrained with the clarified fluid to pollute the
effluent. One solution to this problem is to withdraw the
clarified fluid with a pump and have a cycle at the
beginning of the withdrawal of the clarified fluid in which
a certain amount of this fluid is directed back to the
reactor so as to return the entrained sludge. Such a
solution requires a pump and control mechanism or the like
and close control of the recycle of the clarified fluid to
the reactor.Other attempts to resolve the problem of the sludge
settling within the receiver, have been directed to
physically removing the receiver from the tank during mixing
cycles. This typically requires a cumbersome and expensive
structure which is suitably strong to hold a decanting
system out of the reactor fluid during the mix cycle. In
addition, where freezing is likely to occur, fluid within
the decanting structure may freeze if raised from the
liqui

when said first ends of said funnel shaped
sleeves (38) are forced over said exterior of said downward

facing legs (88) said sleeves are held in a fixed relationship
with said legs by friction.
