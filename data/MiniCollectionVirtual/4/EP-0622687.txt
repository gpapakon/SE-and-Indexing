<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a toner used in a
process by which an electrostatic latent image is
converted to a visible image, in particular, a toner
that can provide electrophotographic images reproduced
in a high image quality and a high minuteness, a one-component
type developer or two-component type
developer making use of such a toner, and a process
for producing toner particles.There is an image forming method in which an
electrical or magnetic latent image formed on a
recording member is converted to a visible image by
attracting to the latent image, electrodetective or
magnetosensitive fine particles called a toner. As
electrophotography, which is a typical example
thereof, a large number of methods are known in the
art as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No.
2,297,691. In general, in this electrophotography, an
electrostatic latent image is formed on a
photosensitive member, utilizing a photoconductive 
material and according to various means, and
subsequently the latent image is developed using the
toner to form a toner image. The toner image is
transferred to a transfer medium such as paper if
necessary, and then the toner image thus transferred
is fixed to the transfer medium by heating, pressing
or using solvent vapor. A copy is thus obtained.In recent years, people show interest in the
improvement of image quality of electrophotographic
reproductions, and hence it is sought to provide an
electrophotographic process that can obtain high-grade
copies with ease. Toner is formed of fine particles
mainly composed of a resin and a coloring material
such as a magnetic material, carbon black or a dye or
pigment, which usually have a particle diameter in the
range of 6 to 30 µm. In the formation of
electrophotographic images, various processes are used
to form the images, and are known to have influence on
their image quality. In general, an improvement in
image characteristics, specifically, in image
reproducibility such as highlight reproducibility or
shadow reproducibility, can bring about an improvement
in image quality of electrophotographic images. For
such purpose, it is considered necessary to use a
toner with a small particle diameter, what is called
small-size toner, as the above toner.Toners have been hitherto commonly obtained by 
mixing and melting in a thermoplastic resin a coloring
material comprised of a dye or pigment and a magnetic
material to uniformly disperse the coloring material,
followed by pulverization and classification to
produce a toner having a desired particle
