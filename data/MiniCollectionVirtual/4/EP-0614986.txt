<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing alkyl (2R-trans)-piperidine-2-carboxylates of formula (I) 
<
IMAGE
>
  in which     R represents a (C1-C3)alkoxy group and   R3 represents a (C1-C3)alkyl group, according to which process an alkyl piperidine-2-carboxylate in the form of a racemate of trans configuration is reacted with an enzyme which specifically degrades the (2S-trans) enantiomer, leaving the (2R-trans) enantiomer essentially intact.

Process for the preparation of alkyl (2
R-trans
)-2-piperidinecarboxylates
of formula (1)



in which

R represents a (C
1
-C
4
) alkoxycarbonyl group and
R
3
 represents a (C
1
-C
4
) alkyl group,

which process is characterized in that an alkyl
2-piperidinecarboxylate in the form of a racemate of

trans configuration is reacted with an enzyme which
specifically degrades the (2
S-trans
) enantiomer, leaving
the (2
R-trans
) enantiomer largely intact.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the enzyme is chosen from the lipase AY of 
Candida
rugosa
 (Amano Pharmaceutical Ltd.), the lipase N of

Rhizopus
 (Amano Pharmaceutical Ltd.), lipase Mucor (Amano
Pharmaceutical Ltd.) or, prozyme 6 
Aspergillus
 (Amano
Pharmaceutical Ltd.), protease 
Aspergillus oryzae

(Sigma), sheep pancreas acetone powder (Sigma) and
porcine: type I pancreas acetone powder (Sigma).
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the enzyme is prozyme 6 Aspergillus

(Amano Pharmaceutical Ltd.).
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the enzyme is porcine: type I

pancreas acetone powder (Sigma).
