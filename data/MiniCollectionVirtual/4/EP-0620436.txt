<ABSTRACT>
The present application relates to a device intended to detect traces of hydrocarbon-containing pollutant products present in an aqueous medium, comprising an electronic circuit containing at least one sensitive element which reacts by breakdown (degradation) to the presence of the said pollutant products, electrical means which interact with the said sensitive element and a means for monitoring the state of the said circuit. The said electrical means comprise at least two contactors which keep the said sensitive element under compression.

<CLAIMS>
A device designed to detect traces of pollutant
hydrocarbon products present in an aqueous medium,

comprising an electric circuit incorporating at least one
sensitive element (9) which reacts by deteriorating in

the presence of traces of said pollutant hydrocarbon
products, electric means (4) co-operating with said

sensitive element and a means for controlling (6) the
status of the circuit, characterised in that said

electric means (4) include at least two contacts
retaining said sensitive element (9) under compression,

said sensitive element being the in form of a thin film.
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that the sensitive element (9) is of a thickness ranging

between 0.05 mm and 0.60 mm on a level with the
compression zone.
A device as claimed in anyone of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the sensitive element (9) is made

from a thermoplastic elastomer.
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that the sensitive element (9) is made from a multi-sequential

butadiene-styrene polymer.
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterised in
that said multi-sequential butadiene-styrene polymer is

partially or totally hydrogenated.
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it also incorporates a

safety element to interrupt the flow of electric current
in the circuit if the device is no longer immersed.
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that at least one of the

contacts co-operating with the sensitive element has an
indentation on a level with the sensitive element.
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 

claims, characterised in that it also has a means for
regulating the compressive force applied to the sensitive

element (9).
