<ABSTRACT>
Rotary cutting device comprising a support structure supporting, between two parallel vertical uprights (1), two superimposed cutting cylinders (4, 5), the device being characterised in that it comprises, between each pair of bearing blocks, an upper one (9) and a lower one (10), a counter-pressure stop secured to the upper bearing block (9) and bearing on the lower bearing block (10) through an elastic means (21) working in compression and constantly exerting upwards, even after the cylinders have heated up and have expanded, sufficient reaction force (F2) to ensure that the spigot (4a) of the upper cutting cylinder (4) is always engaged regardless of the temperature of the cutting cylinders (4, 5).

Rotary cutting device comprising a frame supporting,
between two parallel vertical uprights (1), two cutting

cylinders (4, 5) placed one above the other, with
parallel axes, namely a top cutting cylinder (4) and a

bottom cutting cylinder (5) respectively integral with
raceways (4b, 5b) running on each other, each cutting

cylinder (4, 5) having at each end a coaxial journal
(4a, 5a) mounted so as to rotate in a bearing block

(9, 10) able to slide vertically on the respective two
uprights (1), each of the top bearing blocks (9) being

extended at its top portion, towards the inside of the
device, by a projecting part (9a) subjected to the

downward action of a vertical pressurising jack (14)
mounted on the top portion of the device, whilst each of

the bottom bearing blocks (10) is extended, at its
bottom portion, towards the inside of the device, by a

projecting part (10a) extending above a stop (11)
carried by the corresponding upright (1) and with which

it is in contact, a coupling device being provided
between each pair of top (9) and bottom (10) bearing

blocks comprising an elastic means (21) operating under
compression, tending to raise the top bearing block with

respect to the bottom bearing block and authorizing a
limited vertical stroke of the top bearing block with

respect to the bottom bearing block, the coupling device
further comprising a counter-pressure stop (15) fixed

with the top bearing block (9) and able to bear on the
bottom bearing block (10) when the elastic means is

compressed, the axes of action of the elastic means (21)
and of the counter-pressure stops being spaced from the

axes of the pressurising jacks (14) so that these axes
of action are outside the axes of the pressurizing jacks

(14), characterized in that the characteristics of the 
elastic means (21) are chosen so that this elastic means

will continuously exert upwards, even after a spacing of
the pressurizing stops of the bottom bearing blocks

because of a heating and expansion of the cylinders, a
reaction force F2 sufficient to ensure continuously that

the journal (4a) of the top cutting cylinder (4) remains
constrained within, whatever the temperature of the

cutting cylinders (4, 5).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the elastic means (21) bears on the bottom portion (23)

of a recess (22) formed in the top face of the bottom
bearing block (10).
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the counter-pressure stop (15) is

formed by the bottom part (16a) of a rod (16) for
adjusting the height of the stop, the bottom part (16a)

of the rod (16) is extended downwards by an end part
with a smaller diameter (16c), defining between them an

annular shoulder (24), and the elastic means (21)
surrounds the small-diameter end part (16c) and is in

upward abutment against the annular shoulder (24).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the elastic means (21) is formed

by Belleville washers or an annular elastomer block
surrounding the small-diameter end part (16c) of the rod

(16).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that each pressurising jack (14) is

mounted so that the vertical axis of the jack (14) is
contained in a vertical and transverse plane (P) that

passes by the stop (11) and is placed between the 
vertical and transverse median plane (P1) of the

adjoining top raceway (4b) and the adjoining top
bearing block (9).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the counter-pressure stop (15) is

substantially placed in the vertical and transverse
median plane (P2) that is common to the two top (9) and

bottom (10) bearing blocks of a same pair of blocks.
