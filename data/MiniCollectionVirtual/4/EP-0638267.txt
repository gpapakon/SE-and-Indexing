<ABSTRACT>
A modular reclining chair and method for assembling it are disclosed. 
The modular reclining chair includes a simplified actuation mechanism which 

significantly reduces system complexity and weight while providing improved comfort 
to the seat occupant. The construction is such that the pre-assembled actuation 

mechanism is integrally suspended from and interdependent with modular frame 
components, and included among the modular frame components is a front cross rail 

assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to reclining chairs and, more 
particularly, to a method for assembling an improved reclining chair from pre-assembled 
modular components. Traditionally, reclining chairs are equipped with an actuation mechanism 
which is operatively interconnected between a prefabricated chair frame and a 
stationary base assembly. In general, the actuation mechanism is a combination of 
various mechanical linkages operable for providing various comfort features such as 
independent reclining movement of a seat assembly as well as actuation of an 
extensible leg rest assembly. Due to its relative complexity, it is common practice in 
the furniture industry to assemble the various mechanical linkages of the actuation 
mechanism into a stand alone mechanism frame assembly. A prefabricated U-shaped 
chair frame is frequently bolted around the mechanism frame assembly with the open 
portion of the "U" corresponding to the front of the chair. In addition, the seat 
assembly is supported from the mechanism frame assembly for reclining movement 
with respect to the chair frame. Accordingly, such reclining chairs having a 
mechanism frame assembly within a wood chair frame are commonly referred to as 
having a "frame within a frame" construction. As such, most furniture manufacturers  
 
do not upholster the exterior surfaces of the prefabricated chair frame until after the 
mechanism frame assembly has been installed. Unfortunately, the upholstering 
operation is very inefficient and expensive in that the frequently heavy and 
cumbersome prefabricated chair frame must be manually manipulated in an extremely 
labor-intensive manner. Pursuant to traditional reclining chair construction technique, the free 
ends of the U-shaped frame are attached on opposite sides at the front of the 
mechanism frame assembly. However, the conventional mechanism frame assembly 
typically comprises a narrow rail as the front frame member in order to prevent 
interference with the pantograph linkage that protrudes from the front of the chair 
during extension and retraction of the leg rest member. Accordingly, due to the small 
connection surface between the free ends of the U-shaped chair frame and the front 
member of the mechanism frame assembly, the free ends of the U-shaped chair 
frame, which typically comprise chair arms, are susceptible to an undesirable degree 
of lateral deflection when side-to-side pressure is applied to the chair arms. While many conventional reclining chairs operate

<CLAIMS>
A method for assembling a reclining chair comprising: 
   providing means defining a chair frame having side frame members 

interconnectable with a cross rail assembly having at least two members and a cross 
frame member; 

   suspending said cross rail assembly from an actuation mechanism; 
   suspending said actuation mechanism between said side frame 

members; 
   interconnecting said cross rail assembly and said cross frame member 

with said side frame members; 
   pivotally interconnecting a seat and seat back; and 

   operably connecting said interconnected seat and seat back to said 
chair frame for reclining movement. 
The method of Claim 1 further comprising: 
   connecting said seat to said actuation mechanism for guiding the 

longitudinal movement of said seat in response to said reclining movement of said 
seat assembly. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said step of suspending said 
cross rail assembly comprises: 

   providing support means associated with said actuation mechanism for 
supporting said cross rail assembly; and 

   installing said cross rail assembly on said support means. 
The method of Claim 3 wherein said cross rail assembly includes 
a first set of alignable guide apertures, said support means comprises a first shaft, and 

said step of installing said cross rail assembly comprises inserting opposite ends of 
said first shaft within said first set of alignable guide apertures. 
The method of Claim 4 wherein said step of suspending said 
cross rail assembly is performed prior to said step of suspending said actuation 

mechanism. 
The method of Claim 4 wherein said cross rail assembly is a non-wooden 
front frame rail assembly having a lower cross member and a pair of end 

members rigidly secured to said lower cross member and extending upwardly from 
said lower cross member, said end members having a bracket segment formed 

transversely thereto and having said first set of alignable guide apertures and a set 
of mounting apertures formed therein, and wherein said step of suspending said cross 

rail assembly from said actuation means comprises independently inserting opposite 
end of said support shaft into said alignable guide aperture in each of said end 

member, then rigidly securing said end members to said lower cross member. 
The method of Claim 6 wherein said step of interconnecting said 
cross rail assembly with said side frame members comprises driving fasteners through 

said set of mounting apertures and into said side frame members. 
The method of Claim 4 further comprising the step of 
interconnecting said cross rail assembly to said first shaft such that said first shaft acts 

as an upper cross member at a front portion of said chair frame. 
The method of Claim 4 further comprising the step of installing an 
upholstered trim panel on said cross rail assembly. 
A reclining chair comprising: 
   an actuation mechanism having first and second shafts; 

   a chair frame having side frame members interconnectable to a front 
cross rail assembly and a rear cross frame member, wherein said front cross rail 

assembly and said rear cross frame member are metal; 
   a seat assembly including a seat back, a seat member, and swing 

linkage means for pivotably interconnecting said seat member and seat back to permit 
reclining movement therebetween in response to p
ressure applied by a seat occupant 
to said seat back; 

   means for connecting said swing linkage means to said side frame 
members; and 

   guide means for permitting fore and aft longitudinal movement of said 
seat member with respect to said chair frame, said guide means being operably 

associated with said first shaft for defining the limits of said fore and aft movement of
