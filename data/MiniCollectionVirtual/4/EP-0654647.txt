<ABSTRACT>
A finned tube, suitable in particular for use in a heat 
exchange device, which finned tube is manufactured from metal 

and comprises a tubular body (1) which defines a channel (2), 
connecting means (4, 5) and fin-shaped projections (3, 12) 

extending from the body, wherein the finned tube is 
manufactured by die casting in a die. In further elaboration 

of the invention, the cross section of the tube (1) and the 
fins (3; 12) can be shaped through the die casting operation 

in such a manner that during circumfusion of the tube by gas 
substantially perpendicularly to the channel (2), the 

intensity of the contact between the finned tube and the 
circumfluent gas is optimal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a finned tube, suitable in 
particular for use in a heat exchange device, which finned 
tube is manfactured from metal and comprises a tubular body 
which defines a channel, connecting means and fin-shaped 
projections extending from the body. In the heating of liquids by heat exchange, use is made 
of tubes, and a highly heated fluid is passed through a 
channel or on the outside around the tube. The tubes are 
thereby heated and can deliver the thus absorbed heat to a 
liquid to be heated. In order to obtain a good heat transfer 
between the heated fluid and the liquid to be heated, these 
tubes are typically provided with uniformly spaced-apart fins 
extending from the outside of the tube. Such a tube is 
referred to as a finned tube and has the advantage that the 
contact surface is relatively large by virtue of the fins. Finned tubes are manufactured by providing an extruded 
tubular profile with at least a series of fins by means of 
finishing operations, such as turning or milling, or, for 
instance, by welding-on or by cold deformation. Further, in 
the known finned tubes, the ends are provided in comparable 
manner with, for instance, grooves for fitting packing rings 
or like sealing and connecting means. An important disadvantage of the finishing operation on 
the extruded tubes is that it renders these finned tubes 
relatively expensive to produce. Moreover, the finishing 
operation entails substantial loss of material. Furthermore, 
these finishing operations give rise to stresses in the 
material, which may for instance lead to stress ruptures 
during use. The known finned tubes which are finished by 
turning are relatively large and have a regular rotation-symmetrical 
shape, so that heat exchange devices comprising 
such finned tubes are voluminous and have an efficiency which 
is not optimal. Accordingly, the object of the invention is to provide a 
finned tube of the type described in the preamble which does  
 
not have the above-mentioned disadvantages and enables a good 
heat transfer. To that end, the finned tube according to the 
invention is characterized in that it is manufactured by die 
casting in a die. By manufacturing the finned tube according to the 
invention by die casting in a die, the advantage gained is 
that the fins and connecting means can be formed directly on 
the body without necessitating any further shaping finishing 
operations after the finned tube has been withdrawn. In this 
manufacturing method only a minimum of material is lost
