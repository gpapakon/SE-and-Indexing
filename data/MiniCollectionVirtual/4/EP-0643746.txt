<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with correction 
fluids, that is white paints which are used by typists 
and others to cover typing, writing and drawing errors 
and which, when dry, can be typed, written or drawn 
over. Correction fluids essentially comprise an 
opacifying agent, usually a white pigment, such as 
titanium dioxide, a polymeric binder, and a liquid 
medium in which the binder is soluble or dispersible. 
The composition usually also contains a dispersing 
agent. Such compositions are of two kinds. In the 
first kind the liquid medium is a volatile organic 
solvent, such as a chlorohydrocarbon, a chlorofluorocarbon 
or a petroleum-based hydrocarbon, and in the 
second kind the liquid medium is water-based, for 
example a water/ethanol mixture. There is a general movement and, in some 
countries, a positive requirement, to avoid the use of 
organic solvent-containing compositions for 
environmental reasons and/or to reduce the incidence of 
solvent abuse. The present invention is concerned with 
correction fluids of the second kind, that is containing 
water as the liquid medium. The water-based correction fluids that are 
currently available are entirely satisfactory with 
typewriter and printer inks since these are based on 
waxes and greases, that is they are non-aqueous. Water-based 
correction fluids are not generally satisfactory  
 
with ball point pen inks even though the latter are based on 
greases since certain of the dyes used in such inks have a 
residual water-solubility. Such correction fluids are also 
unsatisfactory with markings made with water-based inks. When water-based correction fluids are used on 
markings made with water-based inks or with ball point pens, 
it is found that although the coating of the correction 
fluid initially appears to cover and obscure the markings, 
the latter show through before or after the coating is 
completely dry. This phenomenon is referred to as 
"bleeding" and is due to the water in the correction fluid 
solubilising the dye or dyes present in the ink of the 
marking. A variety of dyes are used in water-based inks and 
ball point pen inks and the problem of bleeding appears to 
be particularly bad with inks containing anionic dyes. There have been various proposals for ealing with 
the problem of "bleeding" in water-based correction fluids. 
In one proposal, described in WO 92/07039, there is used as 
the polymeric binder of the correction fluid a cationically 
effective film-forming material, especially an acrylate 
polymer, to bind with
