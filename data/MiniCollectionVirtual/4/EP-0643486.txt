<ABSTRACT>
A reference voltage generating circuit is fed from 
a voltage supply source (VSS) providing across first and 

second poles (VS1, ground) a supply voltage (VS1) which 
increases to a substantially constant value (VS1S). It 

includes between the poles (VS1, ground) : 

the series connection of a first resistance (R1) and of a 
second resistance (R2) shunted by a capacitance (C) across 

which the reference voltage (VR1) is generated; and 
the series connection of a third resistance (R3) and of a 
fourth resistance (R4) across which an auxiliary voltage 

(VR2) is developed, the ratio of the first (R1) and second 
(R2) resistance values being equal to that of the third (R3) 

and fourth (R4) resistance values. 
 
A switch (S1) is connected in parallel with the first 

resistance (R1), and a comparator (COMP1) compares the 
reference (VR1) and auxiliary (VR2) voltages and controls the 

switch (S1) such that it short-circuits the first resistance 
(R1) when the reference voltage (VR1) becomes lower than the 

auxiliary voltage (VR2). The reference voltage (VR1) thus 
faster reaches the auxiliary voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reference 
voltage generating circuit fed from a voltage supply source 
providing across first and second poles a first supply 
voltage which increases to a substantially constant value. Such a reference voltage generating circuit is 
already known in the art and may for instance he built from 
the series coupling of first and second resistances across 
the first and second poles, the reference voltage being 
provided across the second resistance. This reference voltage 
then is constituted by a predetermined fraction of the 
average supply voltage. In order to filter fluctuations from 
this supply voltage so as to prevent them from appearing in 
the reference voltage, a capacitance may be provided in 
parallel with the second resistance. However, when the 
reference voltage generating circuit is switched on, i.e. 
when the supply voltage is first applied to it, this 
capacitance causes the above predetermined fraction to be 
only reached after a delay period. Indeed, the reference 
voltage only increases towards this predetermined fraction 
with a time constant equal to 
τ = C×R1×R2R1+R2 
where R1 and R2 
are the respective values of the first and second resistances 
and C is the value of the capacitance. To be noted that the 
lower this time constant, i.e. the lower the mentioned delay 
period, the less fluctuations of the supply voltage are 
filtered. JP-A-59 198 024 discloses a circuit fed from a voltage source 
providing across first and second poles a suppy voltage, which increases 
to a constant value. The circuit includes two voltage dividers comprising 
each two resistors in series and delivering two reference voltages to a 
differential amplifier. This signal is used via on OR gate to trigger a latch 
circuit which generates a reset pulse. EP-A-0 396 812 discloses two voltage dividers generating each 
a reference voltage. These voltages are fed to a comparator which 
delivers a signal following the supply voltage from a time t2. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
reference voltage generating circuit of the above known type 
wherein fluctuations of the supply voltage are filtered, but 
wherein the reference voltage reaches a predetermined 
fraction of the supply voltage faster than in a resistive 
divider solely consisting of two resistances and a filtering 
capacitance.  
 According to the invention, this object is achieved 
due to the fact that said reference voltage generating 
circuit includes : 
between said first and second poles the
