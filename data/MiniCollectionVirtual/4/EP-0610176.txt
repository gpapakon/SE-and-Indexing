<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biological degradation of 
ferric chelates of aminopolycarboxylic acids. More 
particularly, the invention relates to the use of the 
microorganism Agrobacteriumsp. to degrade these compounds, 
especially from aqueous solutions, as well as to biologically 
pure cultures of Agrobacteriumsp. It has heretofore been recognized that metal chelates of 
aminopolycarboxylic acids, such as ferricethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid (ferric-EDTA) and other similar 
chelates, were not readily biodegraded. See, for example, 
Gerike et al., Ecotoxicology and Env. Safety, 3:159-173 (1975). This inability to readily degrade such metal chelates 
leads to numerous environmental concerns. In particular, in 
secondary treatment with an activated sludge, the biodegradation 
of these metal chelates is so slow that these chelates have been 
reported to pass through secondary treatment facilities and 
discharged into the environment without notable degradation. 
See Thom et al., Proc. Rov. Soc. of London, 189:347-357 (1975). 
This has led to concerns for the possible bioaccumulation of the 
chelate in the environment as well as the possible transport of 
heavy metals by release of high concentrations into polluted 
rivers or sediments. Additionally, EDTA has also been 
implicated in the mobilization of radionuclides from nuclear 
waste disposal sites.  
 On the other hand, accumulation of EDTA in the 
environment over time periods on the order of years has been 
shown to be unlikely. For example, EDTA contamination in soil, 
at relatively low concentrations (2-1000 micrograms per gram of 
soil), have been demonstrated to be biologically removed. See 
Tiedje, Appl. Microbiol., 30:327-329 (1975) and Tiedje, J. 
Environ Qual. 6:21-26 (1977). In these studies, the 
disappearance of low concentrations of EDTA and its metal 
chelates was shown to occur in 15-45 weeks on a wide variety of 
soils. However, no single bacterial type was isolated which was 
capable of metabolizing EDTA or its metal chelates. At somewhat higher concentrations (< 2mM) in aqueous 
solution, Belly et al., Appl. Microbiol, 29:787-794 (1975) have 
investigated the aerobic bacterial degradation of the Fe+3 EDTA 
chelate by an acclimated mixed population of bacteria. 
Disappearance of more than 90% of the substrate in 5 days was 
observed at these concentrations. Again, no single bacterial 
type was isolated which would grow on the ferric-EDTA substrate 
as sole carbon source. The abstract for SU 525627 describes removal of heavy
