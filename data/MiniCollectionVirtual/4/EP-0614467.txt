<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for preparing a particulate carrier for an olefin polymerization procatalyst comprising a transition metal compound reacted for a carrier. In the method a melt Mg Cl2-CH5OH-complex is provided containing in the average 3.3 to 5.5 C2H5OH-molecules as per each MgCl2-molecule, the melt MgCl2-complex is sprayed through a nozzle dispersing it into a chamber, wherein a particulate carrier is formed of it and the ready particulate carrier is removed from the chamber. In the methods known so far difficulties have been encountered in endeavours to produce a carrier having an optimal C2H5OH content. In this invention the problems have been solved by removing by the aid of heat so much C2H5OH from the MgCl2-CH5OH-complex in connection with the spraying that the particulate carrier obtained will continue at the average 2.0 to 3.2 C2H5OH molecules as per each MgCl2 molecule. Such a carrier has a suitable C2H5OH content and a good morphology and spraying it does not raise any difficulties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for preparing a 
particulate carrier for an olefin polymerization procatalyst 
comprising a transition metal compound reacted for a 
carrier, in which method 
a) a melt MgCl₂-CH₅OH-complex is provided containing in the 
average 3.3 to 5.0 C₂H₅OH-molecules as per each MgCl₂-molecule b) the melt MgCl₂-complex is sprayed through a nozzle 
dispersing it into a chamber, wherein a particulate carrier 
is formed of it and c) the particulate carrier is removed from the chamber. For the polymerization of olefins the Ziegler-Natta-catalyst 
system is generally used, which consists of a so-called 
procatalyst and a cocatalyst. The procatalyst is based on a 
compound of a transition metal belonging to any of the 
groups IV(A) to VIII(A) (Hubbard) of the periodical system 
of elements and the cocatalyst is based on an organometallic 
compound of a metal belonging to any of the groups I(A) to 
III(A) (Hubbard) of the periodical system of elements. Nowadays, the procatalysts typically comprise an inert 
carrier, on which the actual active catalyst component i.e. 
the transition metal compound or the mixture of the complex 
formed by the catalytical compounds has been layered. The 
morphology and size distribution of the particles of such a 
carrier are most significant for the activity of the 
catalyst and the properties of the polymer obtained through 
the catalyst. With an active catalyst you are, namely, able 
to produce a polymer, from which, due to its purity, no 
catalyst residues need to be removed. The morphology of the 
carrier, again, influences the morphology of the polymer 
product itself for it has been noticed that the morphology 
of the catalyst is repeated in the structure of the polymer 
(the so-called replica phenomenon). When a flowing product 
polymer having the desired morphology and a narrow  
 
particular size distribution is wanted, which is desirable 
in view of the many aims of use of the processing processes, 
the properties of the carrier shall by the aid of the 
replica phenomenon be made similar. Nowadays, the Ziegler-Natta type procatalysts typically 
comprise a magnesium based carrier, such as magnesium 
chloride, which has been treated with a transition metal 
compound of titanium halide, such as titanium tetrachloride, 
and sometimes also with an electron donor compound. It is 
also known that the carrier can be brought to an 
advantageous and equal-size crystal form by letting it 
crystallize as a complex from any of its crystal solvents. The
