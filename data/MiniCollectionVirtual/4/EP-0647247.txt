<ABSTRACT>
The invention disclosed relates to novel branched chain hydroxy-terminated aliphatic azido polymers and copolymers with variable molecular weight (MW) and a single step method for the preparation thereof which involves respectively reacting a high (MW) (0.5 - 5.0 x 106) solid rubbery polyepichlorohydrin (PECH) homopolymer and epichlorohydrin/alkylene oxide copolymer (PEEC), with an alkali metal azide in a suitable organic solvent, in the presence of an initiator at elevated temperature. The MW of the azido product may be controlled by including in the reaction mixture a basic degradation catalyst (such as LiOCH3 or NaOH) and varying the amount of catalyst. When the reaction is catalyzed, the MW of the proudct varies within the range 1,000-40,000 and the hydroxyl functionality is 2-10. Uncatalyzed reactions yield products with MW between 40,000 and 200,000 and a functionality of about 10. The branched azido polymers and copolymers yield energetic binders with improved mechanical properties and thermal stability which are useful in rocket propellants and composite explosives formulations.

 BRANCHED ENERGETIC POLYETHER ELASTOMERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel process for making branched chain hydroxy-terminated aliphatic azido ether polymers and copolymers.The branched chain hydroxy-terminated aliphatic azido ether polymers and copolymers are useful as binders in energetic formulations such as rocket and gun propellants, composite explosives and pyrotechnics to enhance the performance and stability and generally improve the physico-chemical properties. Such polyethers include glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) and copolymers based on GAP.DESCRIPTION ON THE PRIOR ART Linear hydroxy-terminated aliphatic polyethers having alkyl azide substituents, e.g. GAP, and a process for making same are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,268,450 of May, 19, 1981, in the name of M.B. Frankel et al. According to the Frankel et al process, in a first reaction step, the starting material, epichlorohydrin (ECH) is polymerized to polyepichlorohydrin (PECH) using a catalyst, boron trifluoride (BF3) in the presence of a dichloro compound such as carbon dichloride. In a second step, PECH is azidized using a molar excess of the order of 2:1 sodium azide (NaN3) in the presence of a polar organic solvent dimethyl formamide (DMF) for three days at 100°C. It is emphasized that a molar excess, of about 2:1, of sodium azide is typically employed. Since sodium azide is of a poisonous nature, the use of large amounts is a distinct disadvantage. A final purification step using methylene chloride and drying over magnesium sulfate is also described. This multi step process is costly and takes from four to seven days to complete. 

 It is emphasized that Frankel et al 's product is a linear polymer. This is apparent from the functionality of the polymer as determined from the defined structural formula, i.e. including two OH groups, one at each end, and confirmed by the single example wherein the functionality is given as two. In fact, according to Frankel 's process only linear polymers may be obtained.The multi step process can be avoided by purchasing the PECH commercially and azidizing as per the second step, as is done by R.A. Earl in U.S. Patent No. 4,486,351 of December 4, 1984. However, the polyethers obtained according to Earl's process have essentially the same molecular weight as the starting reactant PECH (i.e. the chemical reaction which occurs is a simple replacement of C by N3 in the polymer structure) . Moreover, the choice of commercially available PECH with specific molecular weight is
