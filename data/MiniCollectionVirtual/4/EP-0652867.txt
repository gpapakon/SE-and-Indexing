<DESCRIPTION>
There is an urgent need for efficient drugs in the treatment of mental disorders which are
more effective and which have fewer side effects than the drugs in clinical use today.
Antipsychotic drugs in current use produce a range of troublesome extrapyramidal
movement disorders (e.g. acute dystonic reactions and tardive dyskinesia) and are poor in
ameliorating the negative symptoms (e.g. restricted or blunted emotional arousal) of
schizophrenia. The main disadvantage of the anti-depressants is that they fail to alleviate
depression in 30 to 40 % of patients. Anxioltyics are commonly associated with addictive
properties.Various pyridyl- and pyrimidyl-piperazine derivates pharmacologically active in the central
nervous system are known in the art. Some representative examples can be mentioned.
Azaperone, a neuroleptic drug of the butyrophenone series, is a sedative for pigs. Buspirone
is an anxiolytic. The anxiolytic effect is thought to be mediated via effects on the 5HT-receptors.
In the US Pat No. 4937245, compounds of the general formula C is disclosed

wherein A is selected from pyridyl or pyrimidyl group, e.g.

wherein preferably R6 is hydrogen and R7 is cyano, amides, methoxy or hydrogen
substituent in the 3-position of the pyridyl ring, useful for the treatment of mental disorders,
such as psychoses, depression and anxiety.According to the invention there are provided novel compounds having
the general formula (I)
 
wherein Ar are the same or different and selected from

wherein R3 is fluoro or hydrogen
R1 and R2 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen or alkyl; preferably hydrogen
n is 2 or 3, preferably 2,
X is nitrogen or methine.When X is nitrogen Y is methyleneWhen X is methine Y is oxygen.A is selected from the following pyrimidyl or pyridyl derivates.

preferably b)
R4 and R5 are the same or different and selected from hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl having straight and branched, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon groups having from 1 to 5 cabon atoms,
electron donor groups such as lower alkoxy having straight and branched, saturated and unsaturated alkoxy groups having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms or hydroxy, electron acceptor groups such as
cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, COOR6, CONR7R8 or CO-B, wherein R6 is hydrogen or 
lower alkyl; R7 and R8 are the same or different selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl or
cycloalkyl;
R4 is preferably hydrogen, alkyl, trifluoromethyl, alkoxy,
amide, nitro, alkylcaboxylate or cyano. R5 is preferably alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, halogen, cyano,
alkylcarb
