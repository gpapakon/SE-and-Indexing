<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides aminocyclohexylamides for use within methods of blocking sodium channels in cardiac or neuronal tissue and for use in the manufacture of medicaments to block sodium channels in cardiac or neuronal tissue. This invention also provides commercial kits comprising a pharmaceutical composition containing aminocyclohexylamides and, instructions for the use of the pharmaceutical composition for arrhythmia or for the inducement of local anaesthesia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed toward 
aminocyclohexylamide compounds that block cardiac and 
neuronal sodium channels for use in cardiac arrhythmias 
and the inducement of local anaesthesia, respectively, and 
for use in the manufacture of medicaments to block sodium 
channels in cardiac or neuronal tissue. Compounds that block sodium channels in the 
membranes of cardiac or neuronal tissues are known. For 
example, Class I antiarrhythmic compounds, such as 
lidocaine, will block membrane channels for sodium ions in 
cardiac tissue. A subset of such antiarrhythmic compounds 
(known as Class Ia antiarrhythmics) includes quinidine and 
procainamide which are capable of blocking potassium 
channels in cardiac tissue in addition to blocking sodium 
channels. Such antiarrhythmic compounds will also block 
sodium channels in neuronal tissue which is a property of 
a local anaesthetic compound. Class I antiarrhythmic compounds may be used to 
treat supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular 
arrhythmias. Treatment of ventricular arrhythmia is very 
important since such an arrhythmia, especially ventricular 
fibrillation, can be fatal. Serious ventricular 
arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular 
fibrillation) occur most often in the presence of 
myocardial ischemia and/or infarction. Ventricular 
fibrillation often occurs in the setting of acute 
myocardial ischemia, before infarction fully develops. At 
present, lidocaine is the current drug of choice for  
 
prevention of ventricular fibrillation. However, many 
Class I antiarrhythmic compounds may actually increase 
mortality in patients who have had a myocardial 
infarction. Therefore, there is a need in the art to 
identify new antiarrhythmic treatments, particularly 
treatments for ventricular arrhythmias. The present 
invention fills the need, and further provides other 
related advantages. It has been suggested that opioid antagonists, 
such as naloxone or opioid agonists, may interact with 
sodium channels and have antiarrhythmic activity. 
However, the opioid activity is probably separate from any 
such antiarrhythmic activity, as the former activity 
appears to be stereospecific but the latter activity is 
not (Sarne, Y., et al. (1991) Brit. J. Pharmacol.).International patent application WO 86/07257 
published December 18, 1986, suggested an antiarrhythmic 
utility for certain aminocycloalkylamide compounds 
previously known to be analgesics. One such compound is 
known as U-50,488H and has been shown to be an opioid 
agonist
