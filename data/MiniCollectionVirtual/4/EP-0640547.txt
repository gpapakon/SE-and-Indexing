Rotatable stacking compartment (1) in a cross-layering unit 
(A) for printed products, with a stacking table (2) that 

can be raised and rotated, the walls of the said 
compartment consisting of respective pairs of opposite 

longitudinal or transverse walls (3, 4), at least one of 
the two opposite walls in each case being movable relative 

to its opposite wall so as to allow adjustment to match the 
size of the printed product, and at least one wall being 

removable to allow ejection of the printed products stacked 
in the compartment,
characterized in that
 
at least one longitudinal and at least one transverse wall 

can be adjusted by means of a controllable positioning 
drive (5, 5') associated with it in each case, and the 

positioning drive (5) for the transverse walls at least one 
of which is adjustable, has a positioning motor (6) 

disposed on one of the longitudinal walls (3), the said 
motor acting via a toothed-wheel drive (8) upon at least 

one spindle (10) which displaces either the transverse wall 
(4) or part of the transverse wall (7). 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the toothed-wheel drive (8) for each transverse wall (4) 

comprises a worm-gear (11), the driven worm-gear (12) being 
provided with an internal thread (13) that engages with the 

spindle (10) attached rotatably to the associated 
transverse wall (4) or the corresponding part thereof. 
Stacking compartment according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the transverse wall, or a part thereof in each case, is 

held on guide rods (14) that slide in bearings (15) 
provided on the respective longitudinal wall.  

 
Stacking compartment according to any of the preceding 
Claims,
characterized in that
 
at least one of the transverse walls (4) has swivelling 

gates (7) at the sides that can be swung outwards and that 
can be activated by a driving force. 
Stacking compartment according to any of Claims 1-4, with 
a pressing device (22) to compress the stacked printed 

products, such that the pressing device comprises a 
pressing bar (23) attached to a swivel arm (24) that can be 

swung over the stacked product,
characterized in that
 
the swivel arm (24) is essentially C-shaped and spans over 

the positioning drive arrangement (5) on the outside. 
Stacking compartment according to any of the preceding 
Claims,
characterized in that
 
the two longitudinal walls (3) are disposed on the rotating 

table so that they can move. 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 6,
characterized in that
 
the positioning drive (5') for the longitudinal walls at 

least one of which can move, is fitted in or under the 
table plate (9) of the stacking table (2). 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the two opposite longitudinal walls (3) can be moved by a 

common positioning drive (5').  
 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 8,
characterized in that
 
the positioning drive (5') comprises a positioning motor 

(6') which powers a driveshaft (18) common to both 
longitudinal walls (3). 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 9,
characterized in that
 
a toothed disc (19) is fitted to the driveshaft (18) for 

each longitudinal wall (3). 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 10,
characterized in that
 
the toothed disc (19) in each case drives a positioning 

spindle (21) via a toothed belt (20), so as to move a 
sliding nut (31) attached permanently to the longitudinal 

wall (3). 
Stacking compartment according to any of Claims 7 to 11,
characterized in that
 
the side wall (3) is guided along a linear guide (25). 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 12,
characterized in that
 
the linear guide (25) is a guide-rail. 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the positioning drive (5') for the longitudinal wall (3) 

comprises a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder-piston 
arrangement (27) and if necessary a gear system (30).  

 
Stacking compartment according to Claim 14,
characterized in that
 
the positioning motor (6') is fitted on the side wall (3) 

and displaces the side wall via a toothed drive and a 
toothed rack (29) attached permanently to the stacking 

table.
