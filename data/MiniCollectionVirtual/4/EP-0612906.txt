<ABSTRACT>
A door closer has a housing (36, 38) defining a 
fluid containing chamber (44) and a fluid reservoir (82), 

and includes a piston (50) supported in the chamber for 
movement in one and an opposite direction in response to 

respective opening and closing movements of a door. A 
first fluid passageway (84) defined by the housing provides 

communication between the chamber (44) and the reservoir 
(82) for the free passage of fluid from the chamber (44) to 

the reservoir (82) in response to initial movement of the 
piston (50) in the one direction. A second fluid passageway 

(90, 138, 140, 142, 94), communicating with the chamber 
(44) at a position spaced in the one direction from the 

first fluid passageway (84), contains a check valve including 
a ball (144) biased by a spring (146) to a closed 

position for resisting the flow of fluid from the chamber 
(44) through the second passageway to the reservoir (82). 

The valve includes a valve element (95) which is threadably 
adjustable relative to a valve chamber in the housing to 

regulate the resistance to fluid flow. A third fluid 
passageway (90, 143, 142, 94), communicating with the 

chamber (44) at a position spaced from the first passageway 
and disposed in bypassing relation to the second fluid 

passageway, includes an adjustable metering orifice (91) 
and provides a free flow path from the chamber (44) to the 

reservoir (82). The size of the metering orifice (91) is 
also adjusted by threadably adjusting the valve element 

(95) relative to the valve chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to door closing 
devices and deals more particularly with an improved door closer 
assembly of the type which-includes a door closer and an 
articulated closer arm assembly. A typical door closer of the 
aforedescribed general type is connected between a door and its 
frame to exert closing force on the door when the door is 
released in an open position. The present invention is particularly concerned with 
improvements in a door closer of the aforedescribed general type 
which includes a back check mechanism of an intensity responsive 
type for controlling movement of a door as it approaches a fully 
opened position. Such a device operates in response to the 
intensity of fluid pressure within a door closer and is 
generally effective to control an attempt to violently or 
abusively open a door in a manner which could cause injury to a 
person in the path of the door or result in damage to the door 
itself and/or its supporting structure A substantial change in ambient temperature which 
causes a corresponding change in the viscosity of fluid within 
the door closer can substantially alter the operational 
characteristics of a door closer. A back check device of the  
 
type hereinbefore discussed has the disadvantage of being generally 
temperature responsive. A properly designed intensity 
responsive back check device can be adjusted to substantially 
overcome this problem. Although such a back check device affords substantial 
advantage,it has the disadvantages of being intensity responsive 
throughout its entire adjustable range of operation. Thus, the 
device tends to offer a somewhat greater resistance force to the 
normal opening of a door than might otherwise be desired. The 
present invention is concerned with this problem. In accordance with the present invention a door closer 
is provided having a housing defining a fluid containing chamber 
and a fluid reservoir and a piston supported in the chamber for 
movement in one and an opposite direction in response to 
respective opening and closing movements of a door. The door 
closer further includes first fluid passageway means for the 
free passage of fluid from the chamber to the reservoir in 
response to initial movement of the piston in the one direction 
and second fluid passageway means spaced in the one direction 
from the first fluid passageway means and communicating with the 
chamber and the reservoir. Valve means in the second passageway 
means yieldably resists flow of fluid from the chamber to the
