<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sweetening composition for use in 
food and beverages that contains oligosaccharides as rendered 
less hygroscopic and more flowable so that its particles will not 
readily stick together. The invention also relates to a process 
for producing the sweetening composition. Oligomers in powder or granulated form have the disadvantage 
that their particles will readily stick together and, hence, 
they are stored either in airtight aluminum bags or together with 
desiccants. However, these methods are not effective if 
oligosaccharides are exposed to high temperatures for prolonged 
periods in a summer season, because their particles tend to stick 
together due to the small amount of the water they contain. If 
dextrin, starch or other anti-sticking substances are 
incorporated, the sweetness potency of oligosaccharides will be 
reduced accordingly. If oligosaccharides are supplemented with 
sweeteners such as sugar and glucose, sticking starts to occur in 
areas where those sweeteners contact oligosaccharides and the 
whole part will eventually coagulate. The present invention has been accomplished under these 
circumstances and has as an object providing a sweetening 
composition that is free from the aforementioned problem with  
 
oligosaccharides that their particles tend to stick together on 
account of their hygroscopic nature. Another object of the invention is to provide a sweetening 
composition containing an oligosaccharide that is improved in 
flowability and sweetness potency. A further object of the invention is to provide processes for 
producing the above-mentioned sweetening compositions. The present inventors conducted intensive studies with a view 
to solving the aforementioned problems of the prior art and found 
that the particles of 4,1',6'-trichloro-4,1',6'-trideoxygalacto-sucrose 
(hereunder referred to as "sucralose"), 
6-methyl-3, 4-dihydro-1,2, 3-oxathiazine-4-one-2, 2-dioxide-potassium 
(hereunder referred to as "acesulfame- K"), 3-(L-aspartyl-D-alanineamide) 
-2,2,4, 4-tetramethylethane(hereunder 
referred to as "alitame") and α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 
methyl ester (hereunder referred to as "aspartame") (the four 
compounds are hereunder collectively referred to as the 
"synthetic sweeteners such as sucralose of the invention") would 
not easily stick together at room temperature. Based on this 
finding, the present inventors continued their studies and 
successfully developed sweetening compositions that had an 
enhanced sweetness potency and
