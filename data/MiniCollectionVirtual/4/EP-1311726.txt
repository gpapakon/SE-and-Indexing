<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is generally directed to cellulosic tissues having excellent softness and strength. The tissues are made from a multi-layered paper web containing outer layers made from fibrillated fibers and/or a blend of low-average length and high-average length fibers. The paper web is applied with a softening agent for producing a web having reduced levels of fiber bonding. Moreover, a bonding agent is also applied to the web to improve strength and tear resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGHLY SUBSTANTIVE SOFT TISSUE Background of the InventionAbsorbent paper products such as paper towels, facial tissues and other similar products are designed to include several important properties. For example, the products should have good bulk, a soft feel and should be highly absorbent. The product should also have good strength, even when wet, and should resist tearing. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to produce a high strength paper product that is also soft. Usually, when steps are taken to increase one property of the product, other characteristics of the product are adversely affected.For instance, strength is typically increased by the addition of certain strength or bonding agents to the product. Although the strength of the tissue product is increased by such bonding agents, the resulting tissue product is generally not soft. As a result, various softening agents can be applied to the tissue product to reduce fiber bonding within the paper product and thereby increase softness.However, by reducing fiber bonding with a softening agent, the strength of the tissue product is also significantly reduced. In particular, when applied, softening agents often cause excessive "debonding" and compete with conventional strength agents for bonding sites. As such, most tissues can only accommodate limited amounts of a softening agent. Moreover, even when applied at such limited amounts, the softening agent can nevertheless result in a much weaker tissue product due to the displacement of some of the bonding agent from the bonding sites. This weaker tissue product can exhibit substantial amounts of lint and slough production.As such, a need currently exists for a tissue product that is soft, but also possesses sufficient strength. In particular, a need currently exists for a tissue product that can be applied with a softening agent without adversely affecting the strength characteristics of the tissue so that 

tearing, lint production, and/or slough is not significantly increased.Summary of the Invention The present invention is directed to providing a tissue made from a multi-layered paper web having two outer layers. In general, the outer layer(s) can be made from a variety of fibrous materials. For example, in one embodiment, various cellulosic fibers, such as softwood fibers, hardwood fibers, etc., can be utilized in the outer layer(s).According to the present invention, the outer layer(s) are configured to have an increased number of bonding sites to accommodate sufficient amounts of more than
