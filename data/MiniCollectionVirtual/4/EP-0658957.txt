<ABSTRACT>
A high density 
electrical connector (20) utilizing a flexible film (52) 

having etched circuitry thereon for electrically 
interconnecting to conductive traces or pads on at least 

a pair of planar electronic devices (10,12). The 
connector (20) includes a pair of opposed housing members 

(14), where each housing member comprises a plurality of 
aligned housing segments (22). The segments (22) are 

each have a pair of end walls and at least a pair 
of planar sides (30,32) containing plural, parallel 

grooves (34) for receiving coiled springs therein. 
The springs are positioned to apply a normal 

force to the overlying flexible film (52). 
Each housing 

segment (22) is arranged in end-to-end relationship with 
another segment (22) such that the respective grooves (34) 

are aligned to define a continuous groove between 
adjacent, aligned segments (22), and the end walls (40) 

are profiled to present a sawtoothed configuration (42) 
which when arranged together interfit to form an 

essentially continuous planar side. 
The end wall junction within a groove (34) 

between adjacent segments (22) is angularly disposed relative 
to the axis of the grooves (34). The coiled springs are 

arranged within the grooves (34) so that the convolutions 
thereof are oppositely angled to that of the angle of 

the junction within the groove (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high density 
electrical connector utilizing a flexible film having 
etched circuitry thereon for electrically 
interconnecting to conductive traces or pads on at least 
a pair of planar electronic devices, such as arranged at 
right-angle, mother/daughter-board fashion, or in 
stacking styles for parallel board connection. The architecture of complex computers, business 
machines, communication systems has largely developed 
around the use of a backplane, or mother board, which 
interconnects multiple daughter boards or cards carrying 
functioning components designed to define a host of 
memory and logic functions and the necessary electrical 
components to effect a signal generation and 
transmission. Various circuit paths on backpanel and 
daughter card are interconnected, typically through 
connectors which engage such circuit paths mechanically 
with a normal force between contact surfaces sufficient 
to establish a stable, low-resistance electrical path. 
Increasing circuit complexity has led to an increase in 
contact density to a point where hundreds of circuit 
paths must be interconnected between a given daughter 
card and a backplane, there being numerous daughter 
cards associated with a given backplane. This, in turn, 
has created mechanical problems in that the cumulative 
normal forces required to effect such an interconnection 
sometimes exceed 50 or 80 lbs. per card, per side of the 
card, and all are on extremely close centers, frequently 
in multiple rows on a given side of a card to require 
extremely accurate dimensions of the boards, connectors, 
contacts and the like. A still further problem has to 
do with the surface finishes of the contacts of 
connectors which may be contaminated in inventory or in 
handling and cause a variability in resistance between 
paths which, in the presence of high speed signal pulses  
 
transmitted therethrough alter the resistance and 
impedance of the circuit paths to a detriment of circuit 
function. U.S. Patent No. 5,171,154 represents a major effort 
to achieve a high density interconnection with high 
speed signal capability. A commercial system is 
described in Product Information Bulletin 65188 under 
the heading, "AMP-ASC INTERCONNECTION SYSTEMS," 
copyright 1991 by AMP Incorporated, Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania, U.S. A right-angle, backplane described 
therein shows a plurality of aligned spring carrier 
segments, where an essentially continuous groove running 
along the face of such segments includes plural,
