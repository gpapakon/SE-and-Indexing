<ABSTRACT>

% of manganese, 2.5-5 % of copper, 3-3.5 % of nickel, 14-17.5 % of chromium, at most 0.5 % of molybdenum, 0.15-0.45 

% of niobium, 
and the balance substantially consisting of iron, and wherein an ε phase is deposited in a matrix composed of 6-30 

% by volume 
of an austenitic phase and the rest substantially consisting of a martensitic phase. A process for producing a structural 

member by subjecting a stainless steel having the above composition to the first solution heat treatment at 1010 to 1050 °C and 
then to aging at 520 to 630 °C, wherein the second solution heat treatment is conducted at 730 to 840 °C before aging is conducted 

at 520 to 630 °C, or welding is conducted to give an arbitrary shape to a structural member before the second solution heat 
treatment is conducted. Another process for producing a structural member comprises subjecting a stainless steel having the 

above composition to the first solution heat treatment at 1010 to 1050 °C and then to aging at 520 to 630 °C, conducting welding 
to give an arbitrary shape to a structural member, raising the temperature at a rate of 100 °C/h or below, conducting the second 

solution heat treatment at 1010 to 1050 °C, lowering the furnace temperature to room temperature at a cooling rate of 100 °C/h 
or below, conducting aging at 520 to 630 °C, and lowering the furnace temperature to room temperature at a cooling rate of 100 

°C/h or below.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structural member and
a method of producing the same and, more particularly to a
structural member, such as a hydrofoil of high-speed passenger
craft and an offshore oil-related facility, which requires high
strength, high toughness, and high corrosion resistance and
involves welding work, and a method of producing the same.Conventionally, the heat treatment of the above-described
structural member is normally carried out by quench-and-temper.
After welding is performed, re-solution treatment and aging
treatment are carried out.However, when the above-described re-solution treatment
is done, the welded structural member is deformed by residual
stress or gravitation. To prevent the deformation,
considerably large-scale, firm constraint is required. Even a
structural member which does not involve welding has far lower
toughness as compared with a member heat-treated in accordance 
with the present invention.The present invention was made in view of the above
situation. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is
to provide a structural member in which the deformation
occurring during heat treatment is prevented and the toughness
is significantly improved, and a method of producing the same.The inventors eagerly carried out researches to solve the
above problems. As a result, we invented a new structural
member in which the deformation occurring during heat treatment
is prevented and the toughness is significantly improved, and
a method of producing the same.Specifically, the present invention has features
described in the following items (1) to (15).
(1) A structural member with high toughness and little
distortion due to heat treatment, in which ε phase precipitates
in the matrix having a composition of 0.07% or less carbon, 1%
or less silicon, 1% or less manganese, 2.5 to 5% copper, 3 to
5.5% nickel, 14 to 17.5% chromium, 0.5% or less molybdenum,
0.15 to 0.45% niobium, by weight, and the balance composed
of iron apart from impurities, and comprising 6 to 30 vol% austenitic
phase and the balance composed of martensitic
phase.(2) A ship comprising a hull, propulsion equipment installed at 
the rear of the hull, and hydrofoils which are installed under
the hull in the substantially horizontal direction and are made
of a stainless steel with a structure in which ε phase
precipitates in the matrix having a composition of 0.07% or
less carbon, 1% or less silicon, 1% or less manganese, 2.5 to
5% copper, 3 to 5.5% nickel, 14 to 17.5% chromium, 0.5% or less
molybdenum,
