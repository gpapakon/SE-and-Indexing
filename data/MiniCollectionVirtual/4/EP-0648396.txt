<ABSTRACT>
The invention enables a distinction to be made between at least two types of time slots in serial digital bit streams that are transmitted over a link (2) between a transmitter (4) and a receiver (6) and that derive from the streams of parallel data bits which are delivered to the transmitter via an interface and subjected to parallel-series conversion in the transmitter. Subsequent to analyzing the parallel data bits in a time slot, the type of category to which this time slot belongs is decided and a plurality of marker bits are then inserted into the serial time slots, so as to obtain good transmission properties and also to restore the time slots to a parallel form. More specifically, the time slot categories are mutually separated with the aid of a different number of marker bits in the time slot, all of these marker bits having been assigned the inverted value of a bit other than the marker bits.

<DESCRIPTION>
According to a first aspect, the present invention
relates to a method of distinguishing between at least
two types of time slots in a bit stream receiver in
conjunction with the transmission of serial digital
bit streams which are divided into a number of different
types of time slots.According to another aspect, the invention also relates
to a system which enables a distinction to be
made between at least two types of time slots in the
serial digital bit streams that are transmitted over a
link between a transmitter and a receiver and that
derive from the streams of parallel data bits which
are delivered to the transmitter via an interface and
subjected to parallel-series conversion in the transmitter.In telecommunication network and data network switches,
the serial link interface is located in the so-called
device connecting means of the switch. The
device connecting means include links between the
switch core, multiplexors, and end devices.It has been found desirable for such links to have the
following properties:
Line codes which guarantee changes between zeros
and ones.A high balance probability between the number of
zeros and the number of ones, so as to enable relatively
simple transmission equipment to be used.Space for additional information so as to be able 
to distinguish between different types of time
slots, for instance between time slots for circuit
switched data and packet switch data, so as to
enable memories which contain information concerning
the types of respective time slots to be dispensed
with.The line code and the additional information may
only marginally increase the rate.U.S. 4,891,808 relates to time multiplex in the transmission
of sampled data from a plurality of parallel
input channels on a serial signal line and restoring
the parallel data from the serial line. A synchronization
marker is inserted directly into data for at
least one given channel which shall be used as a
marked or synchronization channel. The marker is
arranged as an "impossible" data pattern. When a
plurality of unchanged levels (e.g. binary ones) occur
in a bit storage register, a central bit is inverted
and therewith mark this channel. The inverted marking
bit is detected and eliminated in the receiver end,
and/or is used to reset the channel counter when
detected on a channel other than the marker channel.U.S. 4,446,555 describes asynchronous time multiplex
switching. Time slots containing sample words have
different numbers of bits. Information concerning "the
rank of the time slot or packet

different types of time slots, for distinguishing between at
least two of the types of time slots in a bit stream

assigned the inverted value of the first bit that follows the

A method according to Claim 2,

CTS-time slots, by one, two and three marker bits

that when scrambling the bits to reduce the risk of imbalance
between the number of zeros and ones, only the bits 0-6 are
