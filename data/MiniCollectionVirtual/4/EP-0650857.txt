<ABSTRACT>
A tow hitch for vehicles, particularly agricultural tractors 
and the like, comprises a main body (4, 5) which is mounted 

for rotating relative to a towing axis (X-X) on a support 
element (2b, 15) connected to the towing vehicle. The 

hitch comprises a cylindrical shank (5) with a peripheral 
groove (21) partially housing at least two ring segments 

(22) which are clamped radially by a retaining ring (23) 
mounted on the shank (5). Torque-limiting means (16, 17, 

18) are provided for allowing the body of the hitch to 
rotate about the towing axis (X-X) only when a predetermined 

torque applied to the hitch is exceeded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tow hitch for vehicles,
particularly agricultural tractors and the like.The invention has been developed particularly, but not
exclusively, with regard to a rear tow hitch for coupling
with a towing eye of a trailer. This tow hitch has to be
mounted on the towing vehicle in a manner such that it is
clamped axially relative to a principal towing axis
substantially parallel to the direction of travel of the
vehicle. At the same time, the hitch must be able to
rotate about the principal towing axis when it is stressed
by a torque transmitted by the towing eye as a result of the
trailer pivoting about the towing axis, relative to the
tractor.The hitch also has a clamping device which allows the
aforesaid rotation about the principal rotation axis only
when the torque exceeds a predetermined value.There are known tow hitches of the aforementioned type in
which the aforesaid rotatable coupling is clamped axially
relative to the principal towing axis by means of components
which are welded to the shank or to the body of the hitch
and form surfaces for striking or abutting corresponding
shoulder surfaces of a support of the hitch mounted on the
rear portion of the tractor.These known hitches have the disadvantage that they require
the welds to be formed accurately and the quality of the
welds formed to be checked rigorously in order to ensure
that the tow hitch is very reliable in continuous use even
in difficult conditions as is required, after all, by the 
current standards. As is well known, the checking of the
quality of welded joints requires a considerable expenditure
of time, involves high costs, and leads to low productivity
owing to the high percentage of products which are rejected
because they do not conform to the prescribed quality
requirements.Moreover, the production quality welds requires the use of
sophisticated and expensive automatic tools or highly skilled
personnel, which helps to increase the final cost of the
finished tow hitch.Document DE-A-30 49 456,
which shows the subject-matter of the preamble of claim 1,
discloses a tow hitch comprising a
rotatable hollow main body which can rotate along a towing
axis when a certain torque applied to the tow hitch is
exceeded. The hollow main body receives a removable element
which is coupled to an abutment element which prevents the
main body of the tow hitch from moving along the towing axis.The object of the present invention is to provide a tow hitch
of the aforementioned type which does not have the
disadvantag
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tow hitch for vehicles, particularly agricultural
tractors and the like, comprising a main body (4, 5) which is

mounted for rotating relative to a towing axis (X-X) on a
support element (2b, 15) connected to the towing vehicle, at

least two abutment surfaces (12, 22d) associated with the
main body (4, 5) preventing it from moving along the towing

axis (X-X) relative to the support element (2b, 15), at least
one (22d) of the abutment surfaces being formed on an

abutment element (22) which is mounted removably on the main
body (4, 5) of the tow hitch, characterized in that the main

body (4, 5) of the tow hitch comprises an at least partially
cylindrical shank (5), the abutment element (22) including at

least two ring segments (22) mounted at least partially in a
peripheral groove (21) formed on the shank (5), and retaining

means (23, 24) clamping the ring segments (22) on the shank.
A tow hitch according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the other abutment surface (12) is formed integrally on the

main body (4, 5) of the tow hitch.
A tow hitch according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the ring segments (22) have combined semicircular-rectangular

cross-sections, the semicircular portion (22a) of the cross-sections
being housed in corresponding semicircular portions

of the peripheral groove (21).
A tow hitch according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the retaining means comprise a retaining ring (23) including

an internal cylindrical wall (23b) which can clamp the ring
segments (22) peripherally.
A tow hitch according to Claim 4, characterized in that
a resilient retaining ring (24) is provided for locking the

retaining ring (23) on the shank (5) axially. 
A tow hitch according to Claim 1, characterized in that
torque-limiting means (16, 17, 18) are associated with the

tow hitch to allow the main body (4, 5) to rotate relative to
the support element (2b, 15) when a predetermined torque

applied to the tow hitch on the towing axis (X-X) is
exceeded.
A tow hitch according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the torque-limiting means comprise at least one ball (17)

which is intended, in the locked condition, to be partially
housed in a corresponding cavity (16) in the main body (4, 5)

of the hitch, the ball (17) being held in the cavity (16) by
the action of resilient means (18), and the exceeding of a

predetermined torque causing the ball (17) to come out of the
cavity (16), opposing the action of the resilient means (18).
A tow hitch according to Claim 7, characterized in that
the resilient means (18) comprise helical springs housed in

holes (19) in the support element (2b, 15).
