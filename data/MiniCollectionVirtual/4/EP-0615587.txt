<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic transmission
for a bicycle. More particularly, this invention relates
to a multi-speed bicycle employing a multi-stage sprocket
assembly, wherein operation of the derailer thereof is
automatically controlled by centrifugal force so that the
driving chain is automatically shifted to higher gears as
the speed of the bicycle increases.Presently there exists many types of bicycle
transmissions. The earliest type of a bicycle
transmission consisted of a rear wheel having a three-speed
hub whose internal gearing was manually shifted by
means of a selector cable extending from a selector lever
conveniently positioned on the handle bars to a movable
selector axle within the rear hub. During cycling, the
three-speed bicycle could be easily shifted into low,
medium and high gears by moving the selector lever to a
low, medium or high position, respectively.In subsequent years, improvements were made to the
conventional three-speed bicycles to make the gear
shifting in the three-speed hub fully automatic depending
upon the speed of the bicycle. Thus, starting from rest,
the automatic transmission of the three-speed hub would
be initially set to the low gear and, upon acceleration
of the bicycle to higher speeds, would automatically
shift to middle gear and then to high gear. This
automatic shifting therefore obviated the need for the
bicyclist to manually change gears via a manual selector
lever.U.S. Patents 3,494,227, 3,492,892, 3,492,893,
3,081,641, 3,513,726, 3,520,214, 3,546,970, 3,546,971, 
3,552,233, 3,592,081, 3,600,974, 3,603,178, 3,608,398,
3,648,547, 3,659,688, 3,661,034, 3,696,690, 3,701,292,
3,830,521 and 4,229,997 disclose various embodiments of
automatic three-speed rear hubs. In most of these prior
patents, the automatic shifting feature is accomplished
through the use of centrifugal weights positioned within
the hub and centrifugally operated to shift gears upon
increased rotational speed of the hub corresponding to
increased speed of the bicycle.In more recent years, the use of three-speed
bicycles have been largely supplanted by ten-speed (or
more) bicycles. More particularly, a conventional ten-speed
bicycle comprises a pair of drive sprockets of
different diameters positioned at the axis of rotation of
the bicycle pedals and a multi-stage sprocket assembly
consisting of five drive sprockets of different diameters
positioned at the axis of rotation of the hub of the rear
wheel of the bicycle. The pedal drive sprockets and the
rear wheel drive sprockets are
