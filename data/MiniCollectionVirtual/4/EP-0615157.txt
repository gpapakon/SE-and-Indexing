<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to a silver halide light-sensitive
silver halide emulsion which comprises tabular
silver halide grains; a silver halide light-sensitive
photographic material in which said emulsion is used; a silver
halide light-sensitive photographic material especially useful
for medical use; and a method of processing the light-sensitive
material.To be more specific, the present invention relates to (i)
a silver halide light-sensitive photographic emulsion having
enhanced sensitivity with less fluctuation in the photographic
properties with the lapse of time and especially excellent in
pressure resistance characteristics, (ii) a silver halide
light-sensitive photographic material comprising said silver
halide light-sensitive photographic emulsion which is suitable
for medical use, (iii) a silver halide light-sensitive 
photographic material suitable for medical use and (iv) a
method of processing the photographic material.Increasing sensitivity is the most effective means to
improve various photographic properties of the silver halide
light-sensitive photographic emulsion. For example, high
sensitive light-sensitive color photographic materials of
recent years were realized by making emulsions having high
sensitivity. About improvement of picture quality, it is
widely known in the art that it is possible to improve
graininess by using a silver halide emulsion containing silver
halide grains of smaller grain size and enhanced sensitivity.Moreover, in the field of X-ray photography, in order to
maintain high sensitivity while achieving a high sharpness and
effectively cutting off crossover light, development of a
light-sensitive silver halide emulsion with increased
sensitivity is indispensable. Accordingly, various research
and development have been made, attempting to produce a silver
halide light-sensitive emulsion having enhanced sensitivity.Especially in recent years, a lot of techniques of
attaining high sensitivity, by using of silver halide grain of
tabular shape has been reported in the art. Those examples
are described,for example, in Japanese Patent O.P.I.
Publications No.58-111935(1983), No.58-111936(1983), No.58-111937(1983),
No.58-113927(1983) and No.59-99433(1984), etc. Since the surface area of the tabular silver halide grain
is larger than that of a so-called regular shape silver halide
grain, such as cubic or octahedral grains, so that it is
possible to increase the adsorption amount of sensitizing dye
on the surface of the grain, and, as a result, there is an
advantage that
