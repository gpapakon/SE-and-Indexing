<ABSTRACT>
The method involves filling containers (4,10) with articles, outputting containers to a full container accepting station (14) and feeding them to an emptying device (56). The dwell time of containers at the full container accepting station is determined and their transportation to the emptying device is dependent on the detected dwell time. If a minimum dwell time is equaled or exceeded the containers are passed directly to the emptying device. Independent claims are also included for the following: a container conveyor.

- the containers (4, 10) are delivered to a full container receiving station (14), and
- the containers (4, 10) are fed to a container emptying device (56),
characterised by
 the steps:

- the residence time of the containers (4, 10) on the full container receiving station (14) is detected,
- the feed of the containers (4, 10) to the container emptying device (56) is controlled in dependence on the detected residence time, and
- if the detected residence time is less than a predetermined minimum residence time the containers (4, 10) are fed to the container emptying device (56) by way of a first detour wherein the length of the detour is controlled in dependence on the detected residence time.
A method according to claim 1 comprising the additional step:

- if the detected residence time reaches or exceeds a predetermined minimum residence time of the containers (4, 10) the containers (4, 10) are passed directly to the container emptying device (56).
A method according to one of the preceding claims comprising the additional steps:

- the containers (4, 10) are fed to a full container feed station (48) before being fed to the container emptying device (56),
- the residence time to be expected for the containers (4, 10) on the full container feed station (48) is detected,
- the residence times detected on full container receiving station (14) and the full container feed station (48) are added, and
- if the sum of the residence times reaches the predetermined minimum residence time the containers (4, 10) are fed to the full container feed station (48) directly from the full container receiving station (14).
A method according to claim 3 comprising the additional step:

- if the sum of the residence times is less than the predetermined minimum residence time the containers (4, 10) are put onto a first storage station (28) for containers (4, 10), wherein instead of the containers (4, 10) which are thus not fed directly to the container emptying device (56) containers (4, 10) of a second storage station (38) for containers (4, 10) are fed to the container emptying device (56).
A method according to claim 4 comprising the additional steps:

- the residence time of the containers (4, 10) on the first storage station (28) is detected,
- the residence times detected on the full container receiving station (14) and the first storage station (28) and the residence time to be expected on the full container feed station (48) are added, and
- if the sum of the residence times reaches the predetermined minimum residence time the containers (4, 10) are fed directly to the second storage station (38).
A method according to claims 4 or 5 wherein the containers (4, 10) are automatically transferred from the first storage station (28) onto the second storage station (38).
A method according to one of claims 4 to 6 comprising the additional steps:

- the residence time of the containers (4, 10) on the first storage station (28) is detected,
- the residence times detected on the full container receiving station (14) and the first storage station (28) and the residence time to be expected on the full container feed station (48) are added, and
- if the sum of the residence times does not attain the predetermined minimum residence time the containers (4, 10) are fed to the second storage station (38) by way of a second detour.
A method according to claim 7 comprising the additional steps:

- the residence time to be expected for the containers (4, 10) on the second storage station (38) is detected,
- the residence times detected on the full container receiving station (14) and the first storage station (28) and the residence times to be expected on the second storage station (38) and the full container feed station (48) are added, and
- when the sum of the residence times reaches the predetermined minimum residence time the containers (4, 10) are fed to the second storage station (38) directly from the first storage station (28).
A method according to claim 8 wherein, when the sum of the residence times does not reach the predetermined minimum residence time, the containers (4, 10) are fed from the first storage station (28) to the second storage station (38) by way of a second detour.
A method according to one of the preceding claims comprising the additional steps:

- for detection of the respective residence time of the containers (4, 10) in the respective stations (14, 28, 38, 48) the containers (4, 10) are detected at the beginning of the respective stations (14, 28, 38, 48),
- a time stamp is associated with the detected containers (4, 10), and
- the time stamp is interrogated at the end of the respective stations (14, 28, 38, 48).
