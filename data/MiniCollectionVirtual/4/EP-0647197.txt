<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a closure (2) for a container (1) for pourable materials, the container having a pour opening with a screw thread on to which the closure (2) is screwed. The aim of the invnetion is to enable a multiplicity of closure elements to be provided using a minimum of material. This is achieved by means of a first, screw-on, element (3) and a second, closure-cap, element (4, 4a) fixed without wastage to the screw-on element.

A closure (2) for a container (1) accommodating a pourable or free-flowing 
product comprising a pouring opening formed with a screwthread, the 

closure (2) being screwable onto this screwthread and comprising a first 
screwthreaded screw-on element (3) and a second closure cap element 

(4,4a) permanently fixed to the screw-on element (3), characterized in that the 
closure (2) consists of two parts, namely the screw-on element (3) and the 

closure cap element (4,4a) and in that the closure cap element (4,4a) is fitted 
onto the screw-on element (3) to form a joint (5) and to extend the screw-on 

element (3) in the direction of its longitudinal axis. 
A closure as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the closure cap 
element (4,4a) is permanently fixed to the screw-on element (3) in liquid-tight 

manner, more particularly by a snap-action fastening (7,8) a bayonet coupling 
or other non-self-uncoupling fastening. 
A closure as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the closure cap 
element (4) is provided with a pouring spout (9) and an integrally formed 

cover (13). 
A closure as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the pouring spout 
(9) is provided with a surrounding collecting channel (10) comprising a return 

opening (11) facing the interior of the container. 
A closure as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the screw-on element (3) is provided with a cylindrical extension (15) 

which projects into the container and of which the interior forms a dispenser 
for the user with the interior of the closure cap element (4a). 
A closure as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the outer surfaces - visible to the user - of the screw-on element (3) on 

the one hand and the closure cap element (4) on the other hand are 
differently coloured and/or textured.
