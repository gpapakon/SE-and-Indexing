<ABSTRACT>
An address decoder has a plurality of address comparator 
circuits (102,103,104) for respective address areas, each 

comparator circuit including a base address register 
(107;111;115), a mask register (105;109;113), an AND gate 

(106;110;114), and a comparator (108;112;116). An address 
data (101) outputted from a processor is inputted to the 

address comparator (102) where the AND circuit (106) takes 
an AND logic of each bit for the address (101) and an 

inverted value taken for each bit from the content of the 
mask register (105) and the result is compared to a starting 

address of the pertinent address area stored in the 
base address register (107). If the compared data are in 

accord, an address decoded signal (117) of "1" is outputted, 
which indicates that the address (101) is an address 

within the pertinent address area. The address comparators 
(103) and (104) function in the same way as the address 

comparator (102). A priority encoder (120) receives address 
decoded signals from the plurality of address comparator 

circuits and outputs a highest priority address 
decoded signal as a final output when it receives a plurality 

of in-accord address decoded signals. The address 
decoder is small in circuit scale and has address area 

expansion capability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information processing
system, and more particularly to an address decoder having
address area expansion capability for use in the information
processing system.In a microprocessor, for performing data communication
with a plurality of external devices, addresses specifying
these respective external devices are outputted. Since
these addresses are of encoded general-purpose signal
lines, an address decoder is necessary, which causes such
functions as waiting and chip-selecting with respect to the
designated device according to the specified address area.Such an address decoder may be one dedicated to each
system, or one used as a general-purpose address decoder.
It is desired for a system to be architected with as small
a number of general-purpose chips as possible. This means
that it is necessary to provide a general-purpose chip with
a general-purpose address decoder so that the same circuit
can provide various functions depending on systems. To this end, an address decoder having a high degree
of freedom is required, which permits address area alteration
through register re-writing with the same circuit.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a prior art address
decoder. With this address decoder, the entire address
area is divided into three division areas without overlap.
The system as shown comprises a first address comparator
306 which includes an area boundary register 302 indicating
a lower area boundary and a subtracter 304 for subtracting
the upper three bits of address data 301 outputted from a
processor or the like and the lower area boundary data; a
second address comparator 307 which includes an area boundary
register 303 indicating an upper area boundary and a
subtracter 305 for subtracting the upper three bits of the
input address data and the upper area boundary data; an AND
gate 311 for taking a logical AND value of the inversion of
the carry from the subtracter 304 and the carry from the
subtracter 305; and an inverter 309 for inverting the carry
from the subtracter 305.The address data 301 is inputted to each of the first
and second address comparators 306 and 307 to be compared
in the subtracters 304 and 305, which are 3-bit subtracters,
to the contents of the area boundary registers 302 and
303, which are 3-bit registers. The subtracters 304 and
305 subtract the contents of the registers 302 and 303 from 
the address 301 and generate the sole carries. Thus, if it
is found as a. result of comparison in the first address
comparator 306 that the address 301 is

An address decoder for decoding an address outputted
from a processor, said address decoder

comprising:

a plurality of address comparator circuits
(102,103,104) provided for respective different areas in an

address space, each of said plurality of comparator circuits
including a base address register (107;111;115)

having a same bit length as said address from said processor,
for storing therein a base address of a predetermined

area in said address area; a mask register (105;109;113)
having a same bit length as said address, for storing

therein a mask value; a masking means (106;110;114) for
masking said address outputted from said processor for each

bit with said mask value of said mask register; and a
comparator (108;112;116) for comparing a resulting value of

masking conducted by said masking means and a value of said
base address stored in said base address register as to

whether two compared values are in accord and for outputting
an address decoded signal as a result of comparison;
wherein said mask value stored in said mask register being
such that said resulting value of masking conducted by said

masking means is in accord with said value of the base
address stored in said base address register if the address

outputted from the processor is an address within said
predetermined area; 

and
a priority encoder (120) which receives said address
decoded signal from each of said address comparator circuits

and outputs a final address decoded signal, and in
doing so, when a plurality of in-accord address decoded

signals are received, outputs a highest priority address
decoded signal as it is, and changes the remainder to out-of-accord.
The address decoder according to claim 1, in which
said masking means (106;110;114) is an AND gate which takes

a logical AND operation of each bit for said address outputted
from said processor and an inverted value taken for

each bit from said mask value stored in said mask register
(105;109;113).
