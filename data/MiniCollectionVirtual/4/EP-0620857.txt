<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chiral synthesis; more
particularly, it relates to the synthesis of certain
homochiral 2-hydroxy acids using 2-oxo carboxylic acid
dehydrogenases as versatile catalysts capable in many cases
of preparation of both (R) and (S) isomers at the alpha
hydroxy group.The synthesis of chiral 2-hydroxy acids is of
considerable importance, since these compounds are versatile
synthetic intermediaries which may be converted to a variety
of compounds with retention of chirality at C-2, including
epoxides, alkyl esters, hydrazinyl esters, α-N-alkoxyamino
esters and α-amino esters. In general, reactions involving
nucleophilic substitution at the 2-position are optimally
effected via the corresponding 2-triflate esters which are
generated insitu and reacted directly with the chosen
nucleophile.The availability of chiral 2-hydroxy acids and
esters possessing an additional prochiral functional group in
the side chain, offers enormous potential for the synthesis
of compounds containing two or more chiral centres. For this
purpose, the hydroxyl group or C-2 is expected to provide an
internal control element, facilitating stereoselective
transformations of the prochiral functional group. In the
case of β,γ-unsaturated compounds, expoxidation would give
access to Sharpless-type intermediates, and dehydroxylation
would produce polyols which may have utility in carbohydrate
synthesis. In the case of the 4-oxo compounds,
diastereoselective ketone reduction would provide either syn- or
anti-1,3-diols, dependant on choice of conditions.Chemistry offers, both in its more traditional forms
and increasingly via enzyme-catalysed reactions, methods with 
potential for the synthesis of the compounds of particular
interest.2-hydroxy acids and esters are valuable synthetic
entities and much effort has been expended in the development
of methods for the preparation thereof in chiral form and
examples of chemical and enzymatic methods are described
below. The main limitations of the chemical procedures are
technical, since the key transformations all involve the use
of water-sensitive reagents at low temperature. With the
exception of enone reduction, product chirality arises in a
stoichiometric sense, either from chiral auxiliary (substrate
control), or from a bulky chiral reductant (reagent control).Asymmetric reduction of 2-keto esters using the
chiral borane potassium 9-0-DIPGF-9-BBNH (Brown H. C., etal,
J. Org. Chem., (1986), 51, 3396) requires a stoichiometric
quantity of the complex reducing agent and
