<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic
elements and more particularly to photographic elements
having improved curl stability and to an improved film
base upon which the photographic element is built.Film curl is of critical importance in the
handling and processing of photographic films. Because
of the high humidity sensitivity of emulsion layers and
the large differences in humidity-expansion coefficient
(HEC) among the various layers in a typical
photographic film, the curvature of the film is
particularly sensitive to variations in relative
humidity (RH). This problem is especially acute in
films wherein a polyester such as polyethylene
terephthalate is used as the film base because such
films have a very low humidity-expansion coefficient,
and it becomes more severe for thinner films.It is desired to make photographic elements
thinner in order to enable more pictures to be taken on
a film housed in cartridges currently utilized or to
provide a film cartridge smaller in size to achieve the
number of exposures equal to that presently available.
This reduction in the thickness of the photographic
elements would in turn permit the manufacture of
smaller cameras. While cellulose triacetate film base
has been for a long time the primary material of
choice, it does not have the physical strength
characteristics necessary in order to reduce the
thickness of the support upon which photographic
emulsion layers are applied. Polyethylene
terephthalate, on the other hand, while it has the 
necessary mechanical characteristics suffers from
problems with respect to curl at various relative
humidity conditions.One technique known in the art to control
curl is to apply a pelloid (gelatin) layer to the side
of the film base opposite to the side the photographic
emulsion is applied. This is disadvantageous because
the pelloid layer can not be applied during the
manufacture of the film base, thus requiring a separate
coating operation which greatly increases the capital
and operating costs.The invention contemplates a light-sensitive
silver halide photographic element having at least one
silver halide containing emulsion layer on a film base,
the film base being a coextruded laminate having a
first layer and a second layer, the first layer being a
polyester of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid or a dialkyl
ester thereof and an alkylene glycol adjacent to the
emulsion layer, the second layer being a polyester
having a humidity expansion coefficient greater than
5 x 10-5  1 / %RH,
(RH is relative humidity) and a Young's
modu
