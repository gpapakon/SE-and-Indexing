<ABSTRACT>
An insulating glass unit is shown comprising a pair of generally parallel, spaced-apart glass panes (10, 12) and a spacer (14) peripherally joining the glass panes (10, 12) to each other. The spacer (14) is a tubular structure (16), and may include a particular desiccant (42) filling at least a section of the interior (26) and conforming to the interior (26) configuration thereof to contribute compressive strength to the spacer (14). The spacer (14) desirably is made from stainless steel sheeting having a thickness not greater than about 0.005 inches. In a preferred embodiment, the spacer (14) includes side walls (20) sealed to the glass panes (10, 12) and an outer wall (18) extending between the side walls (20) and having a sealant free portion (23) between the side walls (20) that extends substantially completely about the periphery of the glass unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to multiple pane insulating glass units for use in windows
and doors and which are particularly characterized by the peripheral spacers that are
employed to support spaced panes of an insulating glass unit with respect to each other.Insulating glass units of the type commonly used in the fabrication of windows and
doors comprise two or more spaced, parallel glass panes. The panes have confronting
surfaces that are separated from one another by a peripheral spacer. One or more of the
confronting surfaces may be coated with metal oxides or other materials to improve
thermal efficiency of the glass units. The spacers, which often are tubular lengths of
metal, extend around the periphery of the glass panes and are sealed to confronting
surfaces of the panes by means of relatively soft, adherent sealant ribbons.From a structural standpoint, spacers must support pairs of glass panes with
respect to one another against stresses resulting from positive or negative windload due
to thunderstorms or major atmospheric disturbances and from temperature variations in
the interpane space due to solar heat gains and weather effects. The organic sealant
ribbons referred to above generally are the weakest structural elements of the spacers,
and because of their resilient nature, they do not restrain glass panes from in-plane or
bending movements. Spacers employing organic sealants thus provide "simply
supported" boundary conditions for the individual panes. On the other hand, ceramic frit
and other rigid spacers that have been suggested in the prior art provide a rigid support
approaching "clamped" boundary conditions. The probability of failure of glass panes
under clamped boundary conditions from windload-induced stresses typically is much
higher than that resulting from simply supported boundary conditions, and multipane
structures using clamped boundary conditions thus tend to require the use of thicker or 
tempered (and therefore more costly) glass panes.Spacers, in addition to exhibiting sufficient strength to enable an insulating glass
unit to withstand wind, pressure and temperature differentials, must additionally support
the panes with respect to each other as the glass units are fabricated, loaded, transported
and unloaded, and as they are handled while being fitted into suitable frame structures.
The stresses to which spacers are subjected during transportation and fabrication steps
can be substantially more severe than stresses resulting from wind loading, particularly
with respect to

An insulating glass unit comprising a pair of generally parallel, spaced-apart
glass panes (10,12) having confronting inner surfaces (11), and a spacer (16) joining

peripheral portions of the glass panes (10,12) to each other and extending about the
periphery of the glass unit, the panes (10,12) and the spacer (16) defining between them a

gas-containing interpane space, the spacer (16) being formed of stainless steel having a
uniform wall thickness of not substantially greater than 0.127 mm (.005 inches), the spacer

(16) having a hollow interior, an interior wall (17) facing the interpane space, an opposed
outer wall (18) and opposed, generally flat side walls (20) each including a portion (56)

extending from one edge of said interior wall (17) inwardly of the interpane space along
the pane surface to which it is sealed with a sealant and a portion (52) doubled back along

an inward part of the inwardly extending portion, the interior wall (17) extending between
the doubled back side wall portions (52) and facing the interpane space, the interior wall

(17) defining with another portion thereof (22 or 24) or with a portion of the side walls
(58,72 or 80,81 or 84) mutually overlapping edge portions and means joining the resulting

overlapping edge portions rigidly to one another at spaced points (32; 62; 72) along their
length in such a manner as to define a plurality of openings at or adjacent the overlapping

edge portions communicating the interior of the spacer with the interpane space.
The glass unit of claim 1 wherein said openings have path lengths of at least 1.02
mm (0.04 inches).
The glass unit of claim 1 or 2 wherein the outer wall (18) extends between said
side walls (20) and includes a sealant-free portion extending between said panes

substantially completely about the perimeter of the glass unit.
The glass unit of claim 3 wherein the sealant-free portion is of uniform width
throughout substantially the entire length of the spacer about the perimeter of the glass

unit.
The glass unit of any one of claims 1-4 including a crush-resistant particulate
desiccant composition (42) carried within and filling at least a section of the hollow spacer 

interior (26) and conforming to the interior configuration thereof to transmit compressive

forces from one side wall (20) of the spacer to the other and to thereby contribute
compressive strength to the spacer.
The glass unit of claim 5 wherein said crush-resistant desiccant particles (42)
comprise spheroidal molecular sieve particles.
The insulating glass unit of any one of claims 1-6 wherein said spacer has ends
joined together at a butt joint, said joint including a key (120) extending into and engaging

the respective ends of the spacer, and a clip (140) formed closely to engage outer surfaces
of the body of the spacer adjacent its ends.
The insulating glass unit of claim 7 wherein said clip (140) includes wall portions
extending along and in contact with the side walls of the spacer at its ends, the clip wall

portions terminating in lip portions (142) that are doubled back upon and crimped to the
doubled back portions of the spacer adjacent its ends.
The insulating glass unit of claim 7 or 8 including a sealant (114) interposed
between the clip (140) and said outer surfaces of the spacer body adjacent its ends.
The insulating glass unit of claim 7, 8 or 9
wherein the key (140) includes outwardly extending resilient fingers

(128) which contact and are bent over by the outer wall (18) to thereby lock the key in place
within the hollow interior of the spacer ends.
A glass unit according to any one of claims 1-10, wherein the outer wall of the
spacer is of generally serpentine shape in cross-section.
