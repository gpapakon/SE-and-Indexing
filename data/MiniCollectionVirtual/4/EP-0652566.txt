<ABSTRACT>
A chip can be provide with circuits to electrically read, 
blow and latch fuses. The circuit allows use of existing 

I/O pads used for other functions on a chip to drastically 
reduce the number of I/O required to blow fuses. The circuits 

also share critical high current carrying lines with 
no impact on fuse functionality and device reliability. By 

offering of complex fuse operations such as electrical 
override, even after they had been blown, essential for 

product screening and product diagnostics. The circuit 
provides a fuse blow circuit fed by a fuse sense circuit 

and fuse lactch circuit. Stored addresses in an address 
buffer addresses the fuses with two sets of inputs: one 

providing electrical override and/or fuse blow information; 
and the second one, normal fuse status. Fuse integrity 

before and after blow is maximized with a dual voltage 
source drive and low current sensing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to VLSI semiconductor chips and 
particularly to a technique to electrically read, blow and 
latch fuses when using fuse technology. As background for our invention, current practice for fuses 
on chips normally requires the use of a single I/O pad per 
each fuse used on a chip. This is done to accomodate the 
high currents and voltages needed to blow the fuses reliably. 
This method is costly because it consumes a high 
number of I/O pads, which severely decreases the number of 
I/O's pads available for chip functionality. As chip densities 
increase, this reduction is no longer acceptable. Our invention deals with the use of existing I/O pads used 
for other functions on a chip to address the fuses so that 
the fuses can be read, blown or electrically bypassed. It 
also deals with sharing critical high current carrying 
lines with no impact on fuse functionality and device reliability. The improvements which we have made achieve three things. 
First, they significantly reduce the number of external I/O 
pads required for fuse technology. Second, they offer the 
flexibility of complex fuse operations such us electrical 
override even after they had been blown, essential for 
product screening and product diagnostics. And thirdly, 
the reliability of the fuses is maximized during all fuse 
operations, such as fuse blow and fuse sense.  These improvements are accomplished by providing a fuse 
latch chip fuse blow circuit that permanently reads the 
outputs of the I/O Address buffers and the fuse sense and 
has the capability of loading either one of those into the 
fuse latch. The fuse latch will output the state of the 
address or the fuse according to the instructions of a fuse 
control circuit. This output is used as required by the 
chip functionality and by the fuse blow circuit. The reliability of the devices during a blow operation is 
accomplished by defining the fuse blow voltage with dual 
power sources. The fuse reliability is accomplished by 
using a trickle current during sensing. These and other improvements are set forth in the following 
detailed description. For a better understanding of the 
invention with advantages and features, refer to the 
description and to the drawings. FIGURE 1 shows schematically an overview of the preferred 
embodiment and particularly shows the Fuse Latch scheme. FIGURE 2 shows an actual implementation of the functional 
block diagram of FIGURE 1. FIGURE 3 shows a truth table of how the Fuse CNTL circuit
