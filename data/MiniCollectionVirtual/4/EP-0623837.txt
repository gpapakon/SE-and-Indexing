<ABSTRACT>
In a spring-loaded hinge for spectacles, the side knuckle (26) is prolonged by a slide (20) which can move in a housing (12) against the action of a spring (30). This spring is housed in a central longitudinal space in the slide and acts between the rear end (27) of the slide and a stopper acting as a lock (40). The lock (40) is made in the form of a plate which has the shape of a circular sector whose apex angle is greater than 100 degrees, the lock being inserted into a slot (22) made through the slide (20). The front end of the spring (30) bears against one of the radii of the lock in such a way that the end of the other radius emerges from the slot in order to catch in an orifice (13) made in the lateral wall of the housing (12).

Spectacle spring hinge whereof the side knuckle (26) is 
extended by a slide (20) able to move in a housing (12) against 

the action of a spring (30) housed in a central longitudinal 
space of this slide and acting between the rear end (27) of the 

slide and a stop acting as a bolt (40), characterised in that the 
bolt (40) is made in the form of a plate in the shape of a 

circular sector having an angle at the apex greater than 100Â°, 
inserted in a slot (22) provided through the slide (20), the 

front end of the spring (30) bearing against one of the radii of 
the bolt so that the end of the other radius emerges from the 

slot in order to engage in an orifice (13) provided in the side 
wall of the housing (12). 
Spectacle spring hinge according to Claim 1, 
characterised, considering that the longitudinal axis of the 

hinge is horizontal and the knuckle is vertical, in that the bolt 
(40) in the form of a circular sector is oriented horizontally 

and in that the engagement orifice (13) is formed in an anti-rotation 
side wall (14) of the knuckle, the wall extending the 

mouth of the housing (12), the slot (22) being cut astride 
between the slide (20) and the body (26') of the knuckle (26). 
Spectacle spring hinge according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the edge of the arcuate front side (41) of 

the bolt (40) is rounded. 
Spectacle spring hinge according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the housing (12) is cylindrical and the slide (20) 

tubular. 
Spectacle spring hinge according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the rear end (27) of the tubular slide (20) is produced 

by pressing the edges towards the inside.
