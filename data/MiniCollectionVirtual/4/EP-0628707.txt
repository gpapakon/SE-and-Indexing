<CLAIMS>
An air-intake system of a multiple-cylinder two-row internal-combustion engine, the 
cylinders of one row each being connected by low-pressure tubes to a respective 

resonance container associated with the said row, and with at least one connecting tube 
between the resonance containers which is connected to a fresh-air inlet (13), 
characterized 
in that
 the system comprises intake-tube extensions (15) associated with the 
low-pressure tubes (9) and extending in part inside the resonance containers (5, 6) and 

connected tc a common container (14) provided with a further fresh-air inlet (18). 
A system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the first and the further fresh-air 
inlet (18 and 13) are arranged jointly in an inlet opening (21) in the container (14). 
A system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 at least one intake-tube 
extension (15) of each cylinder row (1, 2) comprises a shut-off device (19). 
A system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the portions (16) of the 
intake-tube extensions (15) situated inside the resonance containers (5, 6) are cylindrical 

and are in alignment with the inflow funnels (10 of the low-pressure tubes (9) 
and are spaced therefrom by a distance (H). 
A system according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 sliding sleeves (30) displaceable 
on the portions (16) and optionally bridging the distance H) are provided. 
A system according to Claim 2, characterized in that the container (14) is arranged 
extending in the longitudinal direction (R) of the cylinder rows (1, 2) substantially centrally 

between the resonance containers (5, 6), and the connecting tube (11) is divided 
and is connected to the container (14) provided at the end with the inlet opening (18). 
A system according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 second connecting tube (12) 
extending parallel to the first connecting tube (11) is arranged extending between the 

resonance containers (5, 6), and at least one of the said tubes (11, 12) comprises at 
least one shut-off device. 
A system according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the sliding sleeves (30) of each 
resonance container (5, 6) are combined to form a structural unit (31) displaced by a  

 
setting member arranged on the resonance container (5, 6).
