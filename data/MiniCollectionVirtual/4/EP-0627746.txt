<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the preparation of a
processable conductive polymer material based on polyaniline
or a derivative thereof and a protonic doping acid.Electrically conductive polymers are at present subject to
great interest in different parts of the world. These polymers
can be used for replacing metal conductors and semiconductors
in a number of applications, such as batteries,
sensors, switches, light cells, circuit boards, heating elements,
electrostatic discharge elimination (ESD), and electromagnetic
interference shielding (EMI). The advantages of
conductive polymers over metals include their light weight,
mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and less expensive
synthesis and processing methods.Electrically conductive plastics can be divided roughly into
two categories: filled conductive plastics, in which an electrically
conductive filler, such as carbon black or soot,
carbon fiber, metal powder, etc., is added to a thermosetting
or thermoplastic resin, and intrinsically conductive plastics,
which are based on polymers which have been rendered
electrically conductive by oxidation or reduction (doping).The electrical conductivity of filled conductive polymers is
dependent on mutual contacts between the conductive filler
particles. Usually a well dispersed filler is needed at approx.
10 - 50 wt.% to produce composites having a good conductivity.
However, such conductive composites involve problems;
their mechanical and certain of their chemical properties
are crucially impaired as the filler content increases
and the polymer content decreases, their conductivity is
difficult to control especially within the semiconductor 
range, and stable and homogenous dispersing of their filler
into the matrix plastic is difficult.Intrinsically conductive plastics can be prepared from organic
polymers containing long conjugated chains formed by
double bonds and heteroatoms. The polymers can be rendered
electrically conductive by disturbing the π- and π-p-electron
systems in their double bonds and heteroatoms by adding to
the polymer certain blending or doping agents which will
serve as electron receptors or electron donors in the polymer.
Thereby electron holes or extra electrons are formed in
the polymer chain, enabling electric current to travel along
the conjugated chain.An advantage of the intrinsically conductive plastics is the
ease of varying their conductivity as a function of the amount
of the doping agent, i.e. the degree of doping, especially
within low conductivity ranges.
