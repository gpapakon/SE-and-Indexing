<ABSTRACT>
An automotive fuel pump has a pump housing (19) 
encasing a rotary pumping element (18) which forms two non-communicating 

chambers (26a, 26b) comprising an inlet 
chamber (26a) in communication with a fuel inlet (32) and an 

outlet pumping chamber (26b) in communication with a fuel 
outlet. The rotary pumping element (18) has a ring portion 

(60) along an outer circumference, a plurality of vanes (56) 
around an inner circumference radially inward of the ring 

portion (60), and a plurality of axially extending fuel flow 
passages (62) located radially between the plurality of 

vanes and the ring portion. Fuel passes from the fuel inlet 
(32) to the outlet pumping chamber (26b) and from the inlet 

pumping chamber (26a) to the fuel outlet (22) through the 
fuel flow passages (62) in the rotary pumping element (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive fuel pumps, and,
in particular, to a fuel pump housing and rotary pumping
element which combine to form two pumping chambers for
reducing the tolerances required in manufacturing and for
minimising crossing losses.Conventional tank-mounted automotive fuel pumps
typically have a rotary pumping element, 118 encased within
a pump housing, 120, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Fuel flows
into pumping chamber 124 within pump housing 120 and the
rotary pumping action of vanes 126 and vane grooves 128 of
rotary pumping element 118 produces vortices 132. Vanes 126
do no, however, extend to the top, 130, of pumping chamber
124 and fuel crosses between sides 134 and 136.An additional problem with conventional fuel pump
designs is the need for stripper portion 122 in pump housing
120 (Figure 2). As fuel is propelled by rotary pumping
element 118 from the fuel inlet (not shown) to the fuel
outlet (not shown), fuel pressure increases. Since the fuel
inlet and fuel outlet are nearly circumferentially adjacent,
stripper portion 122 must be closely toleranced with respect
to rotary pumping element 118 so as to separate low pressure
region 110 from high pressure region 112 near the inlet and
outlet, respectively, without undue losses. Stripper portion
122 increases the manufacturing cost because close
tolerancing is requiredA conventional fuel pump is shown in DE-A-3 118 533 for
example.The present invention provides a more efficient fuel
pump which minimises crossing losses within the pumping
chamber by providing two pumping chambers on opposed sides
of the pumping element and by providing the pumping element
with an outer ring portion which eliminates the need for a
stripper.According to the invention we provide a fuel pump for
supplying fuel from a fuel tank to an automotive engine, 
comprising:
a pump casing;a motor mounted within said casing and having a shaft
extending therefrom;a rotary pumping element fitted to said shaft having a
ring portion along an outer circumference thereof, a
plurality of vanes around an inner circumference radially
inward of said ring portion, and a plurality of axially
extending fuel flow passages located radially between said
plurality of vanes and said ring portion; anda pump housing mounted within said pump casing and
having a fuel inlet and a fuel outlet therethrough, said
pump housing encasing said rotary pumping element therein:
   characterised in that two axially spaced pumping
chambers connected in series by said flow passages are
formed along
