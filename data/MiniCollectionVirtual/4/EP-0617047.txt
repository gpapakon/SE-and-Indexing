<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to methods of
synthesizing oligonucleotides on solid phase supports,
and more particularly to methods of labeling synthetic
oligonucleotides with fluorescent dyes which use dye-labeled
phospamidites.Synthetic oligonucleotides find widespread
application in molecular biology as probes for
screening complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA)
and genomic DNA libraries, and as primers for DNA
synthesis by DNA polymerases and reverse
transcriptases. The latter applications include
techniques for identifying rare messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
when partial protein sequence information and a
sensitive biological assay for the protein product are
available, e.g. as with gamma-interferon, Gray et al.,
Nature, Vol.295, pgs 503-508 (1982), and techniques for
sequencing DNA by the dideoxy chain termination method,
e.g. Smith et al., NucleicAcidsResearch, Vol. 13,
pgs. 2399-2412 (1985); Schreier et al., J.Mol.Biol.,
Vol. 129, pgs. 169-172 (1979); and Sanger et al., J.
Mol.Biol., Vol. 143, pgs. 161-178 (1980).Recently, improvements in DNA sequencing
methodologies have made use of multiple fluorescent
labels to carry out sequencing automatically on a
single columnar gel, e.g. Smith et al. (cited above), 
and Smith et al., Nature, Vol. 321, pgs. 674-679
(1986). Typically, the fluorescent labels are attached
to the oligonucleotide primers used in such methods in
the final step (or series of steps) in the process of
constructing primers. Currently, in the phosphite-triester
method, prior to removal of the freshly
synthesized oligonucleotide from its support up to
three additional steps are required to attach a
fluorescent label: First, a linking agent is attached
to the 5' end of the oligonucleotide under the same
conditions used to add nucleoside phosphoramidites.
Second, the linking agent is activated, e.g. by
removing a protection group to expose a reactive
functionality, such as a primary amine. And finally,
an activated dye is reacted with the exposed
functionality on the linking agent.For example, GB-A-2153356 and counterpart
FR-A-2556726 describe a method for forming
a labeled polynucleotide by synthesizing a polynucleotide
containing an aliphatic amino group and reacting the
amino group with a suitably reactive label. Additional complications can arise if one attempts
to label the attached oligonucleotide with a rhodamine
dye, an important class of dyes in the selection of
spectrally resolvable sets of fluorescent labels, e.g.
Smith et al. (cited above); and Loken et al, Cytometry,
Vol. 5,
