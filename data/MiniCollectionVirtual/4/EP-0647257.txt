<ABSTRACT>
Adhesives suitable for preparing laminates of polyvinyl chloride or polyvinyl chloride copolymers with wood or metal are prepared from a three-component polymer mixture of polyvinyl chloride itself, a direct ethylene copolymer preferably containing units derived from carbon monoxide, and another direct ethylene copolymer containing units derived from a monomer containing glycidyl units. The adhesive is especially useful for preparing PVC/wood laminates which are subject to outdoor weathering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to adhesive compositions suitable for 
laminating polyvinyl chloride to wood or other substrates. The adhesives are 
blends of polyvinyl chloride and two different ethylene copolymers. The 
adhesive compositions are useful for preparing laminates which are suitable 
for outdoor use. Adhesives are used in a wide variety of fields. For some 
applications the requirements of the adhesive may be very demanding. Not 
only must the composition provide good initial adhesion, but the adhesive 
bond may be subject to extremes of temperature or environment. Such is 
the case for adhesives used in outdoor building applications. In the building industry, siding may be a laminate structure 
which requires an adhesive to make that laminate. That adhesive should be 
readily applied to the laminate components, it must adhere well to each of 
the layers of the laminate and the bonding must withstand the rigors of 
outdoor use. Common among siding materials are wood, metals and 
polyvinyl chloride. Various materials are known for use as thermoplastic 
adhesives which may be applied in the melt as a molten fluid. If the viscosity 
of the melt is suitable for film extrusion, and cooled extruded film is stiff 
enough to handle, these copolymers may be adapted to films for laminating 
adhesives. Various ethylene copolymers are well known as hot-melt 
thermoplastic adhesives. Ethylene/alkyl acrylate/carbon monoxide 
copolymers have been described for use as adhesives for use with a wide 
variety of substrates in PCT publication W091/18043. Ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers have long been known for 
use as hot-melt adhesives. Ethylene/alkyl acrylate or vinyl acetate/carbon monoxide 
terpolymers have been disclosed for use especially as plasticizers for PVC in  
 
U.S. Patent. No.3,780,140. Blends with PVC can be used as limp or rigid 
films. The terpolymers are disclosed alternately as being blendable with a 
large number of other materials, including epoxy resins. None of the references disclose the particular three 
component combination of this invention, nor is there even any suggestion 
that blends of PVC with any ethylene copolymer or copolymers would be 
suitable as laminating adhesives. There is a need for an adhesive material which provides good 
adhesion between polyvinyl chloride sheeting and various substrates, 
particularly wood, and which maintains that adhesion under outdoor 
weathering conditions. The present invention provides for a thermoplastic adhesive 
for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or
