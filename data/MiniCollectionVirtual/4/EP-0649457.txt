<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns base oils with a high viscosity index and improved low-temperature behaviour which contain complex esters and adipic-acid esters of unbranched monohydric alcohols, as well as a method of producing such oils and their use as hydraulic fluids and compressor and engine oils.

Base oils containing 

I. complex esters of 

a) aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic dicarboxylic 
acids containing 2 to 36 carbon atoms, 
b) aliphatic polyols containing 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups, 
c) aliphatic monocarboxylic acids containing 6 to 22 
carbon atoms and 
II. adipic acid esters of unbranched aliphatic monohydric 
alcohols. 
Base oils as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that they contain adipic acid esters of saturated alcohols 

preferably containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. 
Base oils as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that they contain complex esters in which 25 to 75% of 

the hydroxyl groups of the polyols are esterified with 
the dicarboxylic acids and 75 to 25% of the hydroxyl 

groups of the polyols are esterified with the monocarboxylic 
acids. 
Base oils as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that they contain complex esters of aliphatic dicarboxylic 

acids containing 6 to 10 carbon atoms, phthalic 
acid and/or dimer fatty acid, the dimer fatty acid having 

been obtained by dimerization of monounsaturated C₁₂₋₂₂ 
monocarboxylic acids. 
Base oils as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that they contain complex esters of branched polyols 

preferably containing tertiary carbon atoms adjacent the 
primary hydroxyl groups, such as neopentyl glycol, 

trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol 
and/or mixtures thereof. 
Base oils as claimed in claim 1, characterized in  
 

that they contain complex esters of linear monocarboxylic 
acids. 
Base oils as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that they contain the complex esters in quantities of 25 

to 75% by weight and the adipic acid esters in quantities 
of 75 to 25% by weight, based on base oil. 
A process for the production of base oils with a 
high viscosity index and improved low-temperature behavior, 

characterized in that complex esters of 

a) aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic dicarboxylic 
acids containing 2 to 36 carbon atoms, 
b) aliphatic polyols containing 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups, 
c) aliphatic monocarboxylic acids containing 6 to 22 
carbon atoms 
 
are mixed with adipic acid esters of unbranched, aliphatic 

monohydric alcohols. 
The use of the base oils claimed in claim 1 as 
hydraulic, compressor and motor oils.
