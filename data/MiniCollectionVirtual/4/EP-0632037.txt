An azetidinone derivative is reacted with an imide 
compound in the presence of a compound represented by the 

general formula [V]: 


M(Hal)
n
(R⁵)
m
   (V)
wherein M represents a metal atom; Hal represents a halogen 
atom; R⁵ represents a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy 

group, a phenoxy group, a substituted phenoxy group or 
a cyclopentadienyl group; and n and m are each 0, 1, 2, 

3, 4 or 5 provided that n + m stands for the valence of M; 
and 
a base to thereby give a 4-substituted azetidinone 
derivative. The compound represented by the above general 

formula [V] is inexpensive and easy to handle, which makes 

this production process highly excellent from an industrial 
viewpoint.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of a 4-substituted azetidinone derivative 
which is important as an intermediate in the synthesis 
of carbapenem compounds. A carboxylic acid derivative represented by the 
following general formula [I']: 
 
wherein R1 represents an alkyl group which may be 
substituted by an optionally protected hydroxyl group or a 
halogen atom; and R2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl 
group; 
is an important intermediate in the synthesis of carbapenem 
compounds and there have been proposed several methods for 
the production thereof. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. 252786/1987 has disclosed that a 4-substituted 
azetidinone represented by the following general 
formula [II']: 
 
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above; R represents a 
hydrogen atom or a protecting group for N which can be 
easily eliminated; r represents an optionally substituted 
aromatic group formed together with the two adjacent carbon 
atoms; X' represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, SO, SO2 
or Nr4, wherein r4 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl  
 
group or a phenyl group; and Y' represents an oxygen atom, 
a sulfur atom or Nr5, wherein r5 represents a hydrogen 
atom, an alkyl group or a phenyl group; 
is easily hydrolyzed into a carboxylic acid derivative 
represented by the general formula [I']. Further, a compound represented by the following 
general formula [II"]: 
 
wherein X' is as defined above; and r6 and r7 represent 
each a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; 
is described in Tetrahedron Lett. Vol. 27, 5687 - 5690 
(1986). However these 4-substituted azetidinone derivatives 
represented by the general formulae [II'] and [II''] are 
produced with the use of highly expensive materials, i.e., 
boron triflate or tin triflate, which makes them unsuitable 
for industrial purposes. The present invention relates to a process for the production 
of a 4-substituted azetidinone derivative which comprises reacting an 
azetidinone derivative represented by the following general formula: 
 
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a protecting group for N which 
can be easily eliminated; R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 15 
carbon atoms which may be substituted by an optionally protected hydroxyl 
group or a halogen atom; and Z represents a leaving group; with an imide  
 
compound represented by the following general formula: 
 
wherein R2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 15 
carbon atoms; 
R3 and R4 represent each a hydrogen atom, an alkyl
