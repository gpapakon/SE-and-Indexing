<ABSTRACT>
The use of a paper carrier for producing a repulpable carton sealing tape (packaging adhesive tape) which is finished on one side with a repulpable self-adhesive composition and on the other side with a repulpable silicone-free release based on a copolymer of amide/styrene together with a film-former.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a paper carrier for the production of a
repulpable carton sealing tape which is finished on one

side with a repulpable self-adhesive composition and on
the other side with a repulpable silicone-free release

based on a copolymer of amide/styrene together with a
polyvinyl alcohol film-forming agent.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the copolymer is of the N-stearylmaleamide/styrene type.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the paper carrier has a higher transverse extensibility

than longitudinal extensibility.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the paper carrier has a higher longitudinal extensibility

than transverse extensibility.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
a paper carrier of highly sized paper is employed.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
a repulpable self-adhesive composition of the type of a

water-soluble acrylate is used, in particular one having
a polar character.
Use according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the release-coated side can be written on and/or printed.
Repulpable carton sealing tape according to Claim
1, characterized by a paper carrier which is finished on

one side with a repulpable self-adhesive composition and
on the other side with a repulpable, silicone-free

release based on a copolymer of amide/styrene together
with a polyvinyl alcohol film-forming agent.
