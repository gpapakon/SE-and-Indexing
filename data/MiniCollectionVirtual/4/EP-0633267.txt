<ABSTRACT>
An  alpha -amino acid amide is prepared by reacting an N
<
 alpha 
>
-aryloxycarbonyl amino acid with a compound containing a free amino group. This process makes it possible to easily prepare peptides by direct reaction between the carboxyl group of the N
<
 alpha 
>
-aryloxycarbonyl derivative of an amino acid and the free amino group of a second amino acid or of a peptide fragment without any need to protect the carboxyl functional group of the second amino acid or of the peptide fragment, nor for a coupling agent or a deprotection step.

amino group is chosen from ammonia, primary or

secondary amines, amino acids and peptides.
Process according to Claim 6, 
characterized in

 the compound containing a free amino group is an
amino acid.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 it is carried out in an aqueous
liquid medium containing a water-miscible organic

solvent.
