<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polymeric elastomers which 
can be used as encapsulants, sealants, end seals, 
gaskets, and dams for telecommunications and electrical 
devices. Elastomers and sealants containing polyurethanes and 
polyurethane/ureas are well known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,494, (Duck, et al.) discloses a 
sealant composition made from a polyol based isocyanate 
prepolymer and a heat activatable blocked complexed 
amine. The materials are cured by briefly heating to 
above 120°C and subsequently moisture cured. U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,749 (Ito and Hayashi) discloses 
a polyol based isocyanate prepolymer and a vinyl polymer 
containing a hydrolyzable siloxy group. The material is 
stated to be useful as a sealing material when formulated 
with proper fillers and plasticizers. U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,465 (Waddill) discloses sealers 
comprising a polyol based blocked isocyanate prepolymer 
epoxy resin blend cured with a polyether polyamine. U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,435 (Squiller) discloses 
aqueously dispersed polyol based blocked isocyanate-terminated 
prepolymer epoxy compositions which are mixed 
with aliphatic polyamines to form a sealant. U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,205 (Hiles) discloses energy-absorbing 
polyurethane foams and elastomer compositions 
having low compression characteristics comprising a 
flexible polyurethane of essentially linear structure 
containing unsaturated hydroxyl groups. The foams are the 
reaction product of substantially linear polyols having 
hydroxyl end groups and an aromatic isocyanate in less 
than stoichiometric amount. The elastomers are taught to 
have a Shore OO hardness of 50 or less.  
 U.S. Pat. No. 4,476,258 (Hiles) discloses 
polyurethane elastomer compositions having a density from 
about 0.4 to about 1 gm/cc, a compression set of less 
than about 5%, and a recovery time of from about 10 to 
about 100 milliseconds. The elastomers are formed by 
reaction of a urethane-forming component containing at 
least four urethane-forming reactive sites and an 
elasticizing polyol selected from diols and triols and a 
diisocyanate in less than stoichiometric amounts. The 
materials are stated to have a Shore OO hardness of about 
20 to about 70. Various additives and fillers are 
disclosed including hollow glass spheres. U.S. Pat. No. 4,722,946, (Hostettler) discloses non-liquid, 
energy-absorbing polyurethane foams and 
elastomers which are derived from reacting a mixture of 
linear and branched polyols having a linear to branched 
ratio of 1.0 to about 1.18, a polyisocyanate
