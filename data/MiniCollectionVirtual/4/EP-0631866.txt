<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, a drawing-in device for drawing in a plurality of webs of printing carrier, preferably webs of paper, is provided, in which drawing-in elements of finite length grip the beginning of a web of paper and draw the latter out of the roll changers (6 to 8) and the tensioning units (15 to 17) through the printing units (2 to 5) up to folding units (20 to 22). Compared to conventional drawing-in devices, less waste is caused due to the fact that there is an electronic memory in which the lengths of all the drawing-in paths (9 to 11) possible in the printing machine are stored, and the drawing-in elements can be switched on with time delay and switched off simultaneously in accordance with the path difference of the drawing-in paths (9 to 11) and the time differences resulting therefrom at a given drawing-in speed by means of an electronic computer connected to the memory. It is likewise possible to reintroduce a web of printing material which has been torn during the printing process largely without causing waste.

Process for threading several print carrier webs,
preferably paper webs, into a web-fed printing machine

(1) along different threading paths (9 to 11)
respectively from reel changers (6 to 8) and feed units

(15 to 17) into printing units (2 to 5) of the web-fed

printing machine (1) before the printing process with
threading elements which start chronologically

staggered with respect to each other according to the
path difference of the threading paths (9 to 11) and

the time differences resulting from this at
predetermined threading speeds, wherein the process

starts with the print carrier web on the longest
threading path, and the print carrier web on the

shortest threading path follows last, and all the print
carrier webs arrive at the same time at the outlets of

the printing units (2 to 5) and are halted.
Process for threading several printed material
webs, preferably paper webs, into a web-fed printing

machine (1) along different threading paths (9 to 11)
respectively from reel changers (6 to 8) and feed units

(15 to 17) into printing units (2 to 5) of the web-fed
printing machine (1) before the printing process with

threading elements which introduce the print carrier
webs at least at times at different speeds so that

all the print carrier webs arrive at the same time at
the outlets of the printing units (2 to 5) and are

halted.
Process for threading several print carrier webs,
preferably paper webs, into a web-fed printing machine

(1) along different threading paths (9 to 11)
respectively from reel changers (6 to 8) and feed units 

(15 to 17) into printing units (2 to 5) of the web-fed
printing machine (1) before the printing process with

threading elements, wherein for compensation of the
path length differences the print carrier webs are

introduced at least partially via detours so that all
the print carrier webs arrive at the same time at the

outlets of the printing units (2 to 5) and are halted.
Process for threading several print carrier webs
according to claim 1, characterised in that start

initiators (14) are electromagnetically actuated by the
threading elements; deflectors are then set

pneumatically according to the path programme; main
valves in the printing lines belonging to the various

threading paths (9 to 11) are opened one after the
other with the time delay corresponding to the path

difference; and drive stations (12) for advancing the
threading elements pneumatically and the associated

printing units (2 to 5) are switched on.
Process for threading several print carrier webs
according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in

that the threading elements respectively travel round
oscillation rollers (27) in the reel changers (6 to 8),

whilst the oscillation rollers (27) are still
stationary, and in that by means of initiators (19)

which are arranged downstream of the oscillation
rollers (27) in the in-feed direction the beginning of

the respective print carrier web is recognised after it
passes the threading elements, and in that the

oscillation rollers (27) then control the brake force
of the reel changers (6 to 8) via a signal generated by

the initiators (19), so that the rollers exert a
reduced brake force on the print carrier webs during

the threading process. 
Threading device for drawing several printed
material webs, preferably paper webs, along different

threading paths (9 to 11) which are formed by guideways
and deflectors lying outside the roller area,

respectively from reel changers (6 to 8) and feed units
(15 to 17) into printing units (2 to 5) of a printing

machine (1) before the printing process with threading
elements of finite length, the threading paths

(9 to 11) being adjustable by adjustment means so that
the threading elements can draw the print carrier webs

on the respective threading paths (9 to 11), wherein a
number of fixedly mounted rollers and/or rollers

axially movable between the threading paths (9 to 11)
of the print carrier web, corresponding at most to the

number of threading paths, are arranged in the printing
units (2 to 5) or in the region before the printing

units (2 to 5) to compensate for the path length
differences which the print carrier webs wind round

during threading.
Threading device for carrying out a process
according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in

that the adjustment means contain an electronic
computer and an electronic memory and in that in the

switch-over valves are joined via signal lines to the
electronic computer, and are adjustable by it via

signal lines in accordance with a path programme taken
from the electronic memory, and wherein at the start

time the threading elements are located at the
respective start initiators (14) and these are

electromagnetically actuated by the threading elements. 
Threading device for carrying out a process

computer and an electronic memory, in that the reel

changers are constructed as reel changers for
stationary adhesion, in particular in a printing

machine for illustration printing, with respectively

and, behind the feed units in the direction of

introduction, respectively have a start initiator (14)
for recognising the starting point of the respective

threading element, wherein the switch valves are joined

into a position in which the print carrier web covers
the longest possible path so that it does not hang down

loosely or fall back.
