<ABSTRACT>
A unique method for utilizing chemical sensors to determine whether a 
particular sample vial is evidencing bacterial growth includes directing radiation 

sources having closely spaced wavelengths into the sample vial. Emissions from the 
chemical sensor due to the two spectrally spaced radiation sources are monitored, 

and a ratio of their differences and sums 
is calculated. The ratio 

eliminates station-to-station variation between the radiation sources or detectors, and 
also any lot-to-lot variations in the sensor materials. An absolute indication of the 

conditions within the sample vial may thus 
be taken with the method. In 

the prior art, station-to-station variations and lot-to-lot variations in the sensors 
resulted in varying readings for positive and negative samples. Thus, any one 

reading could not be utilized to make a prediction of whether a particular sample is 
a positive or a negative. With the method, each absolute readings can be 

utilized to provide an indication of whether a particular sample is positive or 
negative at any time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application in general relates to a method for collecting data from a 
chemical sensor. The inventive method eliminates variations in monitored readings 
from the chemical sensors which may result based on variations in the composition 
of the chemical sensors, or based on station-to-station variations between several of 
the sensors and their associated monitoring devices. Known chemical sensors are utilized in combination with a blood culture vial 
to monitor changes in the blood culture vial. As is known, a small quantity of 
blood is injected into a vial which contains a culture medium. A chemical sensor 
is positioned inside the vial. The vial is then incubated and monitored for bacterial 
growth. Known chemical sensors include a variety of types of sensors which change 
their light absorption or fluorescent intensity based on changes within the culture 
medium. Radiation is directed into the chemical sensor, and the intensity of a 
resultant emission is monitored. The blood culture medium is tested by monitoring 
the emission over time to detect changes in emission intensity from the chemical 
sensor. If the blood sample is a "positive" and contains bacteria, then it is expected 
that the emission would change with time. In known systems, the emissions are 
monitored over a period of days to determine whether there is a change. The 
monitored emissions may be relatively static for a period of days, but may then 
change drastically to evidence the presence of bacteria in the sample. Such known 
systems have been widely utilized and have experienced great success.  Some deficiencies remain with these systems, however, since the testing 
systems for use with the chemical sensors are typically testing hundreds of sample 
vials at any given time. The monitored emission from any particular chemical 
sensor can vary with variations between the light source positioned adjacent to the 
sensor, the chemical sensor itself, and with a light detector positioned adjacent to 
the chemical sensor. Thus, an absolute determination of whether a particular vial 
is positive or negative upon any one given reading has not been possible with the 
prior art systems. Rather, the emission at any one point in time provides little 
information with regard to the status of the sample vial. The emissions must be 
monitored over a period of time to detect the changes in the emissions which 
indicate a positive sample. Problems arise with sample vials which have been prepared from a relatively 
long period of time relative
