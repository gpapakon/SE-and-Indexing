<ABSTRACT>
A machine for making a package of food casing strands, 
wherein the package has a hexagonal-like cross section, 

comprising a product holder for initially holding a plurality of 
the strands in a configuration having a hexagonal-like cross 

section, wherein the holder has an opening therein for admitting 
the strands into the holder; means for transporting the strands 

to the holder and for depositing the strands into the opening; 
shaker means for shaking the holder at predetermined times to 

ensure that the plurality of strands settle into the holder in 
the configuration having a hexagonal-like cross section; means 

for measuring and cutting a predetermined amount of stretch film, 
where the stretch film is a closed loop used to encase the 

package of food casing strands; means for stretching and holding 
the stretch film into a shape of a polygon having a perimeter 

which is larger than the perimeter of the holder; means for 
moving the stretched film into a position proximate the holder; 

means for pushing all of the strands out of the holder and into 
the stretched closed loop of film; and, means for releasing the 

stretched film, wherein the film then relaxes about the plurality 
of strands to form the package of food casing strands.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging for shirred food casing 
strands, and, more particularly, to a machine for making a 
package of food casing strands where the package has a hexagonal-like 
cross section. Even more particularly, the machine is 
capable of making the packages described in detail in United 
States Patent No. 5,137,153, incorporated herein by reference, 
and its Continuation-in-Part Application No. 07/907,007 
(US-A-5 228 572), also 
incorporated herein by reference. Food casings are used for packaging food products, 
especially meats such as sausages, but also for other food 
products, such as cheeses. When delivered to a meat packer, food 
casing strands are commonly in shirred form, i.e., folded in the 
form of a cylindrical strand, usually containing from 50 to 125 
units of length of unshirred casing per unit length of shirred 
strand. When such casings are shirred, they are packaged for 
delivery to the meat packer, to protect the strand from 
contamination, accidental deshirring (unfolding), crushing, or 
strand breakage (i.e., breaking or deshirring of the strand  
 
between the ends of the strand such that the strand loses 
coherency and is no longer self supporting in folded form). Several problems encountered in the prior art have been 
solved by the unique packages disclosed in the above-identified 
patent and patent application. The problem which remains to be 
solved, and is solved by the invention disclosed herein, is the 
inefficient, manual handling and transport of the shirred 
products from the shirring machine tray into the new package. The invention broadly comprises a machine for making a 
package of food casing strands, wherein the package has a 
hexagonal-like cross section. The machine comprises a product 
holder for initially holding a plurality of the strands in a 
configuration having a hexagonal-like cross section, wherein the 
holder has an outside perimeter having an opening therein for 
admitting the strands into the holder; means for transporting 
the strands to the holder and for depositing the strands into the 
opening; shaker means for shaking the holder at predetermined 
times to ensure that the plurality of strands settle into the 
holder in the configuration having a hexagonal-like cross 
section; means for measuring and cutting a predetermined amount 
of stretch film, where the stretch film is a closed loop used to 
encase the package or food casing strands; means for stretching 
and holding the stretch film into a shape of a polygon having a 
perim

<CLAIMS>
A machine for making a package (212) of food casing strands, 
wherein said package has a hexagonal-like cross section, 

comprising: 

a product holder (141) for initially holding a plurality of said 
strands in a configuration having a hexagonal-like cross section, 

wherein said holder has an opening therein for admitting said 
strands into said holder; 
means (140) for transporting said strands to said holder (141) and for 
depositing said strands into said opening; 
shaker means (190, 204, 205) for shaking said holder (141) 
at predetermined times 

to ensure that said plurality of strands settle into said holder 
in said configuration having a hexagonal-like cross section; 
means (30, 61, 130) for measuring and cutting a predetermined amount of 
stretch film, where said stretch film is a closed loop used to 

encase said package of food casing strands; 
means (41) for stretching and holding said stretch film into a 
shape of a polygon having a perimeter which is larger than the 

perimeter of said holder; 
means for moving said stretched film into a position 
proximate said holder; 
means (208) for pushing all of said strands out of said holder 
(141) and 

into said stretched closed loop of film; and, 
means for releasing said stretched film, wherein said film 
then relaxes about said plurality of strands to form said package 

of food casing strands.
