<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tool for inserting wires into an 
insulation displacement connector having a plurality of insulation 
displacement contacts, the tool comprising an inserter blade for 
forcing wires between tines of the contacts, and a locating device 
to position the tool relative to the connector for insertion of 
wires. Such a tool is conventionally referred to as a punch-down 
tool. Insulation displacement connectors are widely used, particularly in 
the telecommunications field, and require the wires to be pushed 
into a fork-shaped metal terminal so that as the wire is forced into 
the slot of the terminal, the sides of the fork displace the 
insulation round the wire and contact is made with the terminal. The 
wire is thus gripped tightly. To ensure that a proper connection is made, a special tool is used 
to force the wire into the slot of the terminal. This punch-down 
tool guides the wire into the slot of the terminal and controls the 
depth to which it is forced so that the wire is retained correctly 
and not pushed so deeply as to sever the wire. Two types of insulation displacement connector are generally used in 
the United Kingdom, one being made to the AT&T Inc. standard and the 
other being made to the specification used in the United Kingdom by 
British Telecom Plc, and produced originally by Krone AG. 
Separate insertion tools are required for use with these two types 
of connector. Although the function of the tools is similar, they 
differ in their locator sections due to differences in connector 
design. Thus, use of the incorrect tool may damage the connector. 
As well as risking damage by use of the incorrect tool, it is 
inconvenient for an engineer to have to carry different types of 
tool.  
 The present invention aims to overcome the disadvantages mentioned 
above. Accordingly, the invention is characterised in that the locating 
device has a first portion for locating the tool on a first 
connector type for insertion of wires therein, and a second portion 
for locating the tool on a second connector type for insertion of 
wires therein. This arrangement has the advantage of providing a 
universal tool which may be used with more than one type of 
insulation displacement connector. More specifically, the invention is defined by the claims to which 
reference should now be made. In a preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a tool 
wherein the first portion of the locating device is narrower than 
the second portion and is arranged between the
