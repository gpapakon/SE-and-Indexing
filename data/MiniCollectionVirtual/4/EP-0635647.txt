<ABSTRACT>
A mandrel (15) inserted in a rivet body (11) to form a blind 
rivet (10) has a head (17) extending from a rod-shaped mandrel body 

(16). The head (17) is formed to have a plane top surface (18) 
perpendicular to the mandrel body, has a diameter 'D' almost equal to 

the outer diameter of rivet body, and a height 'H' of 80% - 120% of the 
mandrel body's diameter '
d
'. A frustum-shaped low protrusion (19) 
formed centrally of and on the top surface has an upper surface (20) of 

a diameter '
d
1' slightly greater than the diameter '
d
'. A conical or 
otherwise curved surface (21) of the mandrel head applies a force to an 

open end (11
a
) of the rivet body (11) in a self-centering manner when 
force is imparted to the mandrel body (16) to caulk or deform the open 

end (11
a
), so that a uniform caulking is effected, with the head being 
retained not to slip off the caulked rivet body (11) whose length is 

noticeably reduced. Apparatus is also disclosed which, if installed in 
a nailery machine, enables the easy production of the mandrel (15) in 

the same manner as the prior art mandrels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mandrel for use with blind rivets, and 
also relates to an apparatus for automatically manufacturing the 
mandrel. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) of the accompanying drawings show a typical 
example of a prior art blind rivet which comprises a cylindrical rivet 
body 2 and a mandrel 5, the rivet body having at one end thereof a 
flange-shaped rivet head 3. A bore 4 open through the rivet body 
receives the mandrel 5, which has a mandrel head 6 and a constricted 
portion 7. The mandrel head 6 and constricted portion 7 are located 
opposite to said one end of the rivet body 2, and thus opposite to the 
rivet head 3. The mandrel head 6 plastically deforms and expands the 
other, open end of the rivet body. A mandrel body will subsequently be 
broken off the mandrel head 6, at its constricted portion 7. Such mandrels 5 for blind rivets are made of an iron rod 
inexpensively by using in general a nail manufacturing apparatus. The 
round mandrel heads 6 are formed in a one-shot manner by a punching 
press, so that they sometimes are somewhat offset with respect to the 
axis of the mandrel body 5a. Further, a peripheral portion of the 
mandrel head is likely to be uneven in its thickness and/or shape 
around the axis of the mandrel body. If, in use, such an irregularly 
formed head 6 of the mandrel 5 presses or expands the open end 2a of 
the rivet body 2, then the open end 2a will not be deformed uniform as 
shown in Figures 7(b). Consequently, the mandrel head 6 will tend to 
slip off the rivet body, or the rivet body 2 will collapse during the 
riveting operation, and/or the rivet as a whole will fail to achieve an 
expected strength of connection, due to such an irregular deformation. It has been proposed, to resolve those problems, that the surface 
of the mandrel head be shaped spherically or conically so as uniformly 
to bear against the riveting force. However, the size and height of 
such a proposed mandrel head have been so great that the rivets cannot 
be produced by using conventional nail manufacturing apparatus. Header 
or like machines that are required to manufacture the proposed rivets 
must perform several successive steps, thereby involving a higher cost 
as compared with the nailery machines. Such proposals have not  
 
therefore yet been employed for successful and commercial production of 
cheap blind rivets. In addition, the high heads of those mandrels 
increase the extent to which the rivet body has to be compressed. According to one aspect of the invention there is

<CLAIMS>
A mandrel (15) for use with a rivet body (11) having at an end 
thereof a flange-shaped head (12) and being of a cylindrical shape as 

a whole, the mandrel (15) being inserted in the rivet body (11) to form 
a blind rivet (10) and comprising: 

   a rod-shaped mandrel body (16); and 
   a mandrel head (17) formed integral with the body (16) to have a 

plane top surface (18) and a lower curved surface (21), being of a 
diameter 'D' substantially equal to an outer diameter of the rivet body 

(11) and being of a height 'H' which corresponds to about 80% - 120% of 
a diameter 'd' of the mandrel body (16); 

   wherein the plane top surface (18) lies perpendicular to an axis 
of the mandrel body (16), and a low frustum-shaped protrusion (19) 

extends upwardly and centrally of and integral with the top surface 
(18), with the protrusion (19) having an end surface of a diameter 'd1' 

slightly greater than the diameter 'd' of the mandrel body (16), and 
   wherein the lower surface bearing (21) against an end of the 

rivet body when it is riveted is of a conical shape or a like shape and 
decreases in diameter towards the mandrel body (16) so as to exert a 

self-centering radial force to the mandrel head (17) when it is pressed 
into an open end (11a) of the rivet body (11). 
A mandrel according to claim 1, wherein the frustum-shaped 
protrusion (19) has a lower rim of a diameter 'd2' smaller than the 

diameter 'D' of the mandrel head (17). 
Apparatus to manufacture a mandrel (15) to be combined with a 
rivet body (11) to form a blind rivet (10), the apparatus comprising: 

   a pair of half dies (31); 
   each die (31) having a semicylindrical groove (34) firmly to grip 

a raw rod (16') from which a body (16) of the mandrel (15) is formed; 
   an upper conically enlarged recess (35) continuing from the 

groove (34); 
   the enlarged recess (35) increasing in diameter towards an upper 

end of the die so that a mandrel head (17) can be formed thereby; 
   a punch (32) disposed above the half dies (31) and capable of 

 
being pressed downwards onto a raw rod (16') gripped between the half 

dies (31); 
   a guide (33) disposed on and in contact with the upper end of the 

die; 
   a bore (38) formed through the guide (33) to receive the punch 

(32); and 
   a chamfered lower and circumferential edge (39) of the bore (38), 

wherein the chamfered edge defines an additional recess (40) to provide 
a frustum-shaped protrusion (19) which extends upwardly and centrally 

of and integral with a top surface (18) of the mandrel head (17). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein each groove (34) has at 
its bottom and in an intermediate region a gentle projection (36) to 

form a shallow recess (25) in a mandrel body (16) as well as a sharp 
ridge (37) to form a deep recess (26) in the mandrel body (16), wherein 

the shallow recess contributes to form a bulge (24) of such a shape 
that the mandrel body (16) can be temporarily and firmly held in a 

rivet body (11), with the deep recess (26) allowing the mandrel body 
(16) to be broken at the location of the deep recess (26).
