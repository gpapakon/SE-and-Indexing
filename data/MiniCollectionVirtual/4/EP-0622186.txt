<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat-sealable, shrinkable, multilayered polypropylene film comprising at least one base layer containing polypropylene or a polypropylene mixture, and at least one top layer containing a mixture or blend of two components I and II. The mixture contains copolymers and terpolymers of  alpha -olefins having 2 to 10 carbon atoms and HDPE. The film has a longitudinal shrinkage of 
>
 8 %/
<
/= 10 % and a transverse shrinkage of 
>
 10 %/
<
