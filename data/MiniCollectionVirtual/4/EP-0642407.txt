<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for bending plastic pipes in which a plastic pipe is heated at the bending point. The feature of the invention is that the pipe section is first heated in a water bath at about 80  DEG C and then laid around one or more bending plates (3) depending on the desired shape, whereupon the bending plates are subjected to a heat source (5), e.g. a hot air blower and partially heated, depending on the pipe material used, to a maximum of 160  DEG C for 10 to 15 seconds, whereafter the pipe section is subjected to a first cooling process from the inside using cold compressed air (24) for 10 to 15 seconds and finally the pipe section is laid in a cold water bath. The invention also relates to a device for implementing the process.

<CLAIMS>
A method for bending a plastic pipe section in which the
plastic pipe section is arranged around one or more bending

plates dependently on the desired shape of the pipe and
partially heated at bending points, whereafter the pipe section

is subjected to a cooling process from inside of the pipe
section using cold compressed air, prior to placing the pipe

section in a cold water bath, 
wherein
 the pipe section prior to
arranging around the bending plates is first preheated in a

water bath of about 80 °C, and then the pipe section near to the
bending points is overflown at all sides by hot air for a

duration of 10 to 15 seconds so that the pipe section is heated
to a maximum of 160 °C.
An apparatus for implementing the method of claim 1, with a
plurality of bending plates (3) each of which has flutes are

positioned on a frame (1) dependently on the desired shape of
the pipe, with heating sources to heat the pipe section (4) near

to the bending points and with a connection for could compressed
air to flow through the pipe section (4) for cooling purpose,


wherein
 air heaters are arranged as heating sources to heat the
pipe section (4), the air heaters containing an air channel (19)

surrounding the bending plate (3), the bending plates (3) are
provided with at least one row of openings (15) on each of their

two surfaces for the cross flow of hot air from the air heaters
over the pipe section, the openings (15) being in connection

with a plurality of holes (17) which are provided at the base of
the flutes of the bending plates (3), which holes run into an

exhaust conduit (18) for the hot air being provided in the
corresponding bending plate.
The apparatus of claim 2, 
wherein
 switch elements and control
elements for controlling the process are provided on the frame

(1), especially for moving and switching the air heaters on and
off and for introducing compressed air to cool the pipe section. 
The apparatus of claims 2, 
wherein
 the air heater includes a
hot air blower
 (5).
The apparatus of claims 2, 
wherein
 the bending plates (3)
contain two parts, whereby an upper part (12) has the shape of

a semicircle and is placed pivotally on a lower part (13).
The apparatus of claims 4, 
wherein
 the hot air blower (5)
comprises an air channel (19) for the hot air, the air channel

having a cutout (20) in a semicircular shape dependently to the
bending plate.
