non-prediction coding information as reference 

information and for transmitting prediction coding 
information and the non-prediction coding information

non-prediction coding information just after an 

insertion point and the past information than the non-prediction 
coding information are preserved, and a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing 
apparatus such as a transmission 
apparatus in which information of another channel is 
inserted into information of one channel in a 
transmitting system for compressing information by a 
prediction coding and a non-prediction coding and 
transmitting the compressed information. A digital video tape recorder (VTR) is known as an 
image recording apparatus for digitally compressing a 
moving image and recording onto a recording medium such 
as a magnetic tape or the like. There are a fixed 
length coding compression method and a variable length 
coding compression method as compression methods. As 
compared with the fixed length coding compression 
method, in the variable length coding compression 
method, although a high compression ratio of about 1/10 
to 1/20 can be accomplished without largely 
deteriorating a picture quality, there is a drawback 
such that a compression data amount per picture plane 
(frame or field) is not uniform and it is difficult to 
perform editing (joining of recordings or the like),  
 
retrieval, and special reproduction (random access, 
fast forward reproduction, reverse reproduction, etc.). An MPEG (Moving Picture Coding Expert Group) uses 
an intra-frame (field) coding and a prediction coding 
which uses a future and/or past frame (or field) as a 
reference picture plane and periodically arranges the 
intra-frame coded picture plane (hereinafter, called 
an I frame) and, on the other hand, sets the picture 
plane in the I frame to a prediction coded picture 
plane. According to such a recording method, the 
compression data of an inter-frame prediction coding 
picture plane in the reverse direction or both 
directions is recorded after the compression data of 
the prediction reference picture plane on the recording 
medium. According to such a recording method, for 
instance, a limitation occurs at the joint position of 
the image, for instance, in the insertion recording 
(joint recording). For example, even if the operator 
tries to join another picture plane just after the 
inter-frame prediction coding picture plane in the 
reverse direction or both directions, the image data of 
the picture plane which is necessary to decode such an 
inter-frame prediction coding image in the reverse 
direction or both directions needs to be preserved on 
the recording medium. On the other hand, a prediction 
relation between the old picture plane to be inserted  
 
and the new picture plane to be inserted becomes 
discontinuous
