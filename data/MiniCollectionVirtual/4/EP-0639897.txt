<ABSTRACT>
Several emitter stations (MS1-MS4) are allowed to 
transmit call set-up packets in RACH channels and user 

information packets in TCH channels to a receiver station 
(BTS) which is provided with an array of N sensors (A₁-A
N
) and 
with a receiver (RM) adapted to simultaneously acquire N-1 

packets from the emitting stations and to derive therefrom N-1 
distinct array output signals (X₁-X
N-1
). During a RACH 
channel, the identity of the emitting station (MS) as well as 

the direction of arrival (Θ) and the power (σ) of its signal 
are stored in a parameter data base (PDB) together with its 

weight vector (
W
) calculated (WVG) therewith and a TCH 
channel allocated (CHC) thereto. During either a RACH or a 

TCH channel, the weight vectors of a emitting station are 
provided by the data base and are applied to multipliers (M₁-M
N-1
) 
which produce the N-1 array output signals. In case of 

interference between emitting stations using a same TCH 
channel, another TCH channel is allocated to one of the 

interfering stations and the weight vectors are updated. The 
stations also send tracking packets in the RACH channel to 

update their parameters and accordingly the weight vectors in 
the data base. 
 
The present radio telecommunication system is 
particularly suitable for the pan-European "Global System for 

Mobile communications" GSM wherein the emitter stations are 
mobile stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio
telecommunication system including a plurality of emitter
stations adapted to transmit packets of data in predetermined
channels of a radio link to a receiver station provided with
an array of sensors for capturing the transmitted data and
with receiver means coupled to said array of sensors and
adapted to generate array output signals at array output
terminals of said receiver station, said receiver means
including a weight vector supplier means coupled to said
array of sensors and adapted to derive weight vectors from
the captured data, and a plurality of multiplier means
coupled to said array of sensors and to said weight vector
supplier means for providing said array output signals as a
function of the product of said captured data and weight
vectors.Such a radio telecommunication system is already
known in the art, e.g. from the article "Improving the
Performance of a Slotted ALOHA Packet Radio Network with an
Adaptive Array" by J. Ward and R. T. Compton, published in
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOL.40, NO.2, February
1992, pages 292 to 300. Therein, the data packets are
transmitted according to the well known Slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA)
scheme which is for instance described in the book
"DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS - Fundamentals and Applications" of
B. Sklar, edited by Prentice-Hall International, Inc., 1988,
and more particularly in Chapter 9, pages 475 to 505,
thereof. A problem with the S-ALOHA is that when two or more
emitter stations are simultaneously transmitting data packets
in a same channel, a collision occurs so that the receiver
station is no longer able to distinguish between the emitter
stations from which the data packets are received. As a
consequence, all these data packets are then generally
rejected and the emitter stations have to transmit them 
again. Obviously this leads to an important increase of the
traffic load on the radio link.This problem with the S-ALOHA scheme is partially
solved in the system according to the above mentioned article
by the use of an adaptive array of sensors or antennas
instead of the generally used omnidirectional antenna. The
performance of the radio telecommunication system is thereby
improved as will be explained below.When the emitter stations are not transmitting data
packets, the array of sensors operates as an omnidirectional
antenna and is thus adapted to capture any data packet coming
from any direction, i.e. from any of the emitter stations.
After having detected the beginning, i.e. a training
