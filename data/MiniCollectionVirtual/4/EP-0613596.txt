<ABSTRACT>
A filter comprising at least one inductor (2, 3) attached to a printed circuit board (7) within a metal housing (8), and including sockets (10, 11, 12) having one end attached to the printed circuit board at the connection points between each inductor (2, 3) and the printed circuit on the board, while the other end is connected to a capacitor (Cp,n) and a PIN diode (Dp,n) which are series-mounted at each of the other ends between a socket and the wall of the housing (8) to which the PIN diode (Dp,n) is attached. The filter may be used in a portable radio transceiver.

<CLAIMS>
High- and medium-power radio frequency filter 
including at least one inductor (2, 3) fixed to a printed 

circuit board (7) within a metal casing (8) characterized 
in that it comprises bushes (9, 10, 11) fixed by one of 

their ends to the printed circuit board at the points 
where each inductor (2, 3) is linked with the printed 

circuit of the board, and linked by their other ends to 
a capacitor (C
p,n
, C
s,m
) and a "PIN" diode (D
p,n
, D
s,m
) 
which are mounted in series at each other end between a 

bush and one wall of the casing (8) on which the "PIN" 
diode (D
p,n
, D
s,m
) is fixed. 
Filter according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each inductor (2, 3) is cut out from a metal sheet 

of low thermal resistance arranged flat on a printed 
circuit board. 
Filter according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each inductor (2, 3) is formed by a printed circuit 

etched on the printed circuit board. 
Filter according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the inductor (2, 3) is formed by a wire wound on a 

former. 
Filter according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the printed circuit board (7) is of 

ceramic. 
Filter according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the printed circuit board is of 

epoxy glass. 
Filter according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the board (7) is engaged in two 

grooves within the casing (8) where it is held in contact  
 

by two springs (17, 18) in order to transmit the heat 
dissipated by the inductors (2, 3).
