<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
equipment used in processing storage phosphors, and more 
particularly relates to a door assembly for an autoloader 
for feeding cassettes and/or pallets containing cassettes to 
and receiving them from a storage phosphor reader. It is convenient to handle a storage phosphor 
within cassettes that protect the storage phosphor from 
extraneous light and damage. This is particularly the case 
for storage phosphors in which the latent x-ray image stored 
in the storage phosphor is read by photoelectrically 
detecting an emitted x-ray image formed by scanning with 
stimulating radiation. It is desirable to retain the storage 
phosphor within a cassette except during actual processing. 
A hook extractor can be used with the storage phosphor 
cassette to move a storage phosphor plate to and from a 
storage phosphor reader for processing. It is desirable to 
provide an apparatus to automate the presentation of such 
cassettes to the extractor so that a number of cassettes 
could be processed in succession without attention from an 
operator. It is also desirable that such an apparatus be 
able to accurately position cassettes and/or pallets 
containing cassettes sequentially to simplify removal and 
reinsertion of the storage phosphor and that the 
presentation apparatus be separate from the storage phosphor 
reader to permit interchange of units and reduce repair 
time. An examplary device for presenting cassettes is an 
autoloader for use with a plurality of cassettes and/or 
pallets containing cassettes which comprise first and second 
cog belts spaced apart so as to provide a plurality of 
cassette retaining sites one of which defines a cassette 
read site for presenting of the cassette to the reader. 
Access to the loading and unloading sites is obtained 
through a portal in the cabinet enclosing the mechanism. An  
 
access door is provided for allowing access within the 
cabinet through the portal. The belts are driven such that 
the cassettes are each individually positioned at the read 
site for removal of the storage phosphor therein for reading 
by the reader after which it is returned to the cassette. 
The autoloader allows a plurality of individual cassettes to 
be stored for automatic supplying to the reader thus freeing 
the operator to accomplish other duties. In a storage phosphor reader/storage phosphor 
cassette autoloader system, it is desirable that the door 
which allows access to the loading and unloading sites of 
the autoloader operate in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A storage phosphor cassette autoloader (10) 
comprising: 

   first and second endless conveyor belts (40), said 
conveyor belts (40) being spaced apart and having a 

plurality of outwardly extending shelves (42) in vertical 
alignment so as to define a cassette read site (46) and a 

plurality of cassette retaining sites (44); 
   a conveyor belt drive (150) for driving said 

conveyor belts (40) in unison to transfer cassettes (20) 
loaded in said retaining sites (44) serially through said 

read site (46); said autoloader being characterized by 
   a body (14) encasing said conveyor belts (40) and 

having a portal (26) adjoining said cassette retaining sites 
(44) for allowing cassettes (20) to be placed on or removed 

from said shelves (42) of said conveyor belts (40); 
   at least one panel (33), which is placed adjacent 

to said portal (26) for allowing access through said portal 
(26), and which is movably mounted on said autoloader (10) 

for movement between a closed position and an open position; 
   a door drive (60) for moving said panel (33) 

between the open and closed positions; 
   a force sensitive assembly (110),(112) mounted on 

the leading edge of said panel (33) for sensing if said 
panel (33) is obstructed while it is being closed; 

   a source of electrical power (24V) for supplying 
power to said conveyor belt drive and said door drive; and 

   a control circuit for controlling said autoloader 
to (a) cut off all power from said source of power (24V) to 

said conveyor belt drive (150) and said door drive (60) if 
there is an interruption in any of a plurality of control 

voltages (VCC, +12, -12); (b) disable the conveyor belt 
drive (150) while said panel (33) is in the open position; 

and/or (c) if said force sensitive assembly (110),(112) 
senses an obstruction while said panel (33) is being closed, 

 
control said door drive (60) to move said panel (33) to said 

open position. 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 wherein said 
force sensitive assembly (110),(112) includes a force 

sensitive resistor, the resistance of which changes with an 
application of force. 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 wherein said 
force sensitive assembly (110),(112) includes an electrical 

cable (93) movable with said panel (33) and wherein said 
control circuit causes said panel (33) to be moved to the 

open position and to remain in the open position, if said 
electrical cable (93) is damaged. 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 including a 
cassette advancing and retracting assembly (170) and a 

cassette drive (172) therefore, and wherein said control 
circuit disables said cassette drive (172) when said panel 

(33) is open or when there is an interruption in any of said 
control voltages (VCC, +12, -12). 
The autoloader (10) of claim 1 including a 
movable table (34) for supporting cassettes (20) and a table 

drive (160) for extending and retracting said table (34) and 
wherein said control circuit disables said table drive (160) 

when there is an interruption in any of said control 
voltages (VCC, +12, -12).
