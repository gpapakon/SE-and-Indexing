<ABSTRACT>
A storage and dispensing system (10) for storing and dispensing pre-packaged pharmaceutical products (12) and other products. The system includes a cabinet (14); a plurality of product conveyors (16) mounted within the cabinet and each configured for holding at least one product; an infeed conveyor (18) for receiving products that are to be stored in the cabinet; an outfeed conveyor (20) for receiving products that are to be dispensed from the cabinet; and a transporter (22) moveable within the cabinet for transporting products between the product conveyors and the infeed and outfeed conveyors for storing products in or dispensing products from the cabinet.

 AUTOMATIC DISPENSING SYSTEM FOR UNIT MEDICAMENT PACKAGESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the field of medicament dispensing systems. More particularly, the invention relates to a system for automatically storing and dispensing pre-packaged pharmaceutical products and other products.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTPharmacists spend an increasing amount of their time at work educating patients about the proper use and handling of medicaments and pharmaceuticals. While this trend toward more patient counseling increases patients' knowledge about medicaments and decreases improper use of the medicaments, it leaves less time for pharmacists to fill and dispense the medicaments.Automatic medicament dispensing systems, such as the one disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,337,919 (hereinafter referred to as the "'919 patent"), have been developed to assist pharmacists in the filling and dispensing of prescriptions and to therefore have more time for patient counseling. The system described in the '919 patent is extremely effective for filling and dispensing medicaments in the form of pills and capsules, but is not designed to dispense larger pre-packaged pharmaceuticals. Pharmacists in many areas dispense large quantities of pre-packaged boxes and/or bottles of pharmaceuticals and currently must manually locate and dispense these items, reducing the amount of time the pharmacists have for patient counseling.Another problem with manually locating and dispensing pre-packaged pharmaceuticals is that errors are sometimes made. For example, because many boxes of pre-packaged pharmaceuticals look alike even though they have different strengths or quantities of medicaments therein, pharmacists occasionally locate and dispense the 

wrong box. Such errors can obviously have serious consequences for the patients receiving the products.Accordingly, there is a need for an improved medicament dispensing system that overcomes the limitations of the prior art. More particularly, there is a need for a medicament dispensing system for automatically storing and dispensing prepackaged pharmaceutical boxes and/or bottles and other products so that pharmacists will have more time for patient counseling and will not make errors while manually dispensing the products.OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention solves the above-described problems and provides a distinct advance in the art of automatic medicament dispensing systems. More particularly, the present invention

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS:
1. A storage and dispensing system for storing and dispensing products, the system comprising: a cabinet; a plurality of product conveyors mounted within the cabinet and each configured for holding at least one product; an infeed/outfeed mechanism coupled with the cabinet for receiving products that are to be stored in or dispensed from the cabinet; and a transporter moveable within the cabinet for transporting products between the product conveyors and the infeed/outfeed mechanism for storing products in or dispensing products from the cabinet.
2. The system as set forth in claim 1 , the infeed/outfeed mechanism including - an infeed conveyor for receiving products that are to be stored in the cabinet, and an outfeed conveyor for receiving products that are to be dispensed from the cabinet.
3. The system as set forth in claim 2, further including a control system for controlling operation of the infeed conveyor, the outfeed conveyor, and the transporter.
4. The system as set forth in claim 3, the control system including a controller, a display, an input device, a scanner, and a label printer.
5. The system as set forth in claim 2, further including a plurality of sensors coupled with the infeed conveyor for sensing a physical attribute of products placed on the infeed conveyor.
6. The system as set forth in claim 2, further including a ram assembly coupled with the infeed conveyor for moving products from the infeed conveyor to the transporter. 

7. The system as set forth in claim 1 , the transporter including a conveyor operable to move products placed thereon to the product conveyors and to remove products from the product conveyors.
8. The system as set forth in claim 7, the transporter further including a motor for moving the conveyor of the transporter.
9. The system as set forth in claim 8, the transporter further including gears powered by the motor, each ofthe product conveyors including a gearfor rotating the product conveyor and operable to engage with the gears of the transporter so that the motor and gears of the transporter rotate the gear of the product conveyor.
10. A storage and dispensing system for storing and dispensing products, the system comprising: a cabinet; a plurality of product conveyors mounted within the cabinet and each configured for holding at least one product; an infeed conveyor for receiving products that are to be stored in the cabinet; an outfeed conveyor for receiving products that are to be dispensed from the cabinet; a transporter moveable within the cabinet for transporting products between the infeed conveyor and the product conveyors and between the product conveyors and the outfeed conveyor for storing products in or dispensing products from the cabinet; and a control system for controlling operation of the infeed conveyor, the outfeed conveyor, and the transporter.
11. The system as set forth in claim 10, further including a plurality of sensors coupled with the infeed conveyor for sensing a physical attribute of products placed on the infeed conveyor. 

12. The system as set forth in claim 10, further including a ram assembly coupled with the infeed conveyor for moving products from the infeed conveyor to the transporter.
13. The system as set forth in claim 10, the transporter including a conveyor operable to move products placed thereon to the product conveyors and to remove products from the product conveyors.
14. The system as set forth in claim 13, the transporter further including a motor for moving the conveyor of the transporter.
15. The system as set forth in claim 14, the transporter further including gears powered by the motor, each ofthe product conveyors including a gearfor rotating the product conveyor and operable to engage with the gears of the transporter so that the motor and gears of the transporter rotate the gear of the product conveyor.
16. The system as set forth in claim 10, the control system including a controller, a display, an input device, a scanner, and a label printer.
17. A storage and dispensing system for storing and dispensing products, the system comprising: a cabinet; a plurality of product holding mechanisms mounted within the cabinet and each configured for holding at least one product; and a transporter moveable within the cabinet for transporting products to and removing products from the product mechanisms for storing products in or dispensing products from the cabinet.
