<ABSTRACT>
A ferroelectric memory includes a bit line for developing a 
signal coupled to a ferroelectric memory cell. An integrated load 

capacitor and sense amplifier are also coupled to the bit line. An 
isolation circuit is included for selectively electrically isolating the bit 

line load capacitor from the sense amplifier and ferroelectric 
memory cell during the active operation of the sense amplifier. The 

isolation circuit is compatible with both non-volatile ferroelectric and 
volatile dynamic memory operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ferroelectric memory
circuits and, more particularly, to an improved sensing and writing
scheme for use with ferroelectric memory cells.A column 10 of a one-transistor, one-capacitor ("1T-1C")
ferroelectric memory array circuit is shown in the simplified circuit
diagram of FIG. 1. (The use of "column" and "row" designations is
based upon conventions in the art, and does not necessarily
correspond to the orientation shown in the drawing figures.)
Although memory circuits typically include numerous columns, for
simplicity and clarity only one column 10 is shown in FIG. 1. Column
10 includes a sense amplifier 16 coupled to complementary bit lines
26 and 28. Bit line 26 (a first input of sense amplifier 16) is coupled
to a column portion 14 of 1T-1C memory cells and has an associated
bit line capacitance illustrated as capacitor 12. Bit line 28 (a
reference input of sense amplifier 16) is coupled to a reference cell
18. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that an actual
column 10 is symmetrical with respect to sense amplifier 16, and
that the schematic diagram of FIG. 1 represents a simplified electrical
equivalent circuit. In practice, each bit line has an associated bit line
capacitance, attached memory cells, and a reference cell. Four 1T-1C
ferroelectric memory cells 20 are shown within column portion 14 in
FIG. 1, although any number can be used. Each memory cell 20 is
representative of an entire row of memory cells (not shown) that
span column 10. Each memory cell 20 includes an MOS access
transistor 22 and a ferroelectric capacitor 24. The drain of access
transistor 22 forms a data input/output node of each memory cell 20
and is coupled to bit line 26. Each memory cell 20 is read from and 
written to by the action of a corresponding word line 30, and a
corresponding plate line 32.A column 40 of an alternative two-transistor, two-capacitor
("2T-2C") ferroelectric memory array circuit is shown in the
simplified circuit diagram of FIG. 2. Column 40 includes a sense
amplifier 48 coupled to complementary bit lines 52 and 54.
Complementary bit lines 52 and 54 are coupled to a column portion
46 of 2T-2C memory cells. Each bit line has an associated bit line
capacitance illustrated as capacitors 42 and 44. Since data is stored
in a differential fashion in memory cells 50, column 40 does not
include a reference cell. Four 2T-2C ferroelectric memory cells 50
representative of an entire row of memory cells are shown within
column portion 46 in FIG. 2, although
