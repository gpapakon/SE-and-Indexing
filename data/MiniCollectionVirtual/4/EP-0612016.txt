<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to methods and apparatuses which allow buses of the serial type to be protected against the consequences of a short circuit in the vicinity of the decentralised units attached to this bus. It consists in providing means (301) for detecting the equalisation of the potentials of the data wires and means (304, 204) making it possible under the control of these detection means to disconnect the decentralised unit (200) responsible for the short circuit. Means (308, 205) are furthermore provided for short-circuiting the bus supply wires in a predetermined sequence so as to inform the central unit (100) of the disconnection of the said decentralised unit. It allows protection of the central unit and of the fault-free decentralised units attached to the bus.

Method for protecting against short-circuits in a serial bus, 
comprising at least two data wires to which a central unit (100) 

and a decentralized unit (200) operating under the control of the 
central unit are connected, the decentralized unit being 

responsible for a short-circuit in the bus, characterized in that 
the decentralized unit detects (206) the equality or the quasi-equality 

of the potentials on the data wires in order to 
determine the short-circuit state of the bus and in that, based 

on this information, it disconnects itself (204) from the data 
wires of the bus. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that, the bus 
also having two supply wires connected to the central unit (100) 

and to the decentralized unit (200) which is responsible for the 
short-circuit, the decentralized unit temporarily short-circuits 

(205) the supply wires of the bus to indicate its state of 
disconnection. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in that the short-circuiting 
takes place for a very short time period (d) repeated 

at very long time intervals (T). 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that the short-circuiting 
takes place in the form of a burst of at least two 

very short time periods (d) separated by a substantially longer 
time period (D) and repeated at the end of a much longer time 

period (T). 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the disconnection (204) of the data wires is effected 

with a random delay (t1) according to the decentralized unit in 
question, so as to be able to isolate only the decentralized unit 

responsible for the short-circuit. 
Device for implementing the method according to any one of  
 

Claims 1 to 5 and comprising the said serial bus, the said 
central unit (100) and the said decentralized unit (200), 

characterized in that the decentralized unit (200) responsible 
for the short-circuit comprises means (301) for detecting the 

equalization of the potential of the data wires of the bus (D, 
(D)) and means (304, 204) for disconnecting itself from the data 

wires of the bus, under the control of the detection means. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that the said 
decentralized unit (200) also comprises means (308, 205) for 

short-circuiting its supply wires in a given sequence.
