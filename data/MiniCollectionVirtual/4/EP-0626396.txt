<ABSTRACT>
A polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) having high mechanical 
properties both at room temperature and at high temperatures, 

having very good processability and high thermochemical resistance 
to dehydrofluorination, is prepared by means of a 

polymerization process of vinylidenefluoride in aqueous 
emulsion at a temperature comprised between 95° and 120°C, in 

the presence of a chain transfer agent.
 

In this way it is possible to obtain, using non-hazardous 
peroxidic initiators (for instance diterbutylperoxide), a PVDF 

particularly suitable for applications where high mechanical 
and thermochemical resistance properties are required, such as 

for instance the manufacture of articles for chemical industry 
(pipes, valves, fittings, tanks, heat exchangers, membranes, 

flanges, etc.).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyvinylidenefluoride 
(PVDF) having high mechanical properties and high 
thermochemical stability, and to the preparation process 
thereof. It is known that vinylidene fluoride (VDF) can be 
polymerized in aqueous emulsion using inorganic or organic 
peroxides as initiators. Among the latter, diterbutylperoxide 
(DTBP), as described in US Patent 3,193,539, has resulted 
particularly effective. With such initiator the polymerization 
is carried out at high temperatures, generally comprised 
between 120° and 130°C, and at a pressure comprised between 
300 and 1000 psig, without employing any chain transfer agent. 
The PVDF obtained with such process shows a low cristallinity 
degree, with a high amount of structural defects (tail-to-tail 
and head-to-head inversions, branchings, microgels), and 
consequently unsatisfactory mechanical properties and 
mouldability, quite unsuitable for the manufacture of 
articles, such as pipes, valves, fittings, tanks, heat 
exchangers, membranes, flanges, etc, to be employed in the  
 
chemical industry. In US Patent 3,475,396 a VDF polymerization process is 
described, wherein diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate (IPP) is used 
as initiator, optionally in the presence of a suitable chain 
transfer agent. IPP is characterized by a half-life of 1 hour 
at 61°C, therefore the process can be carried out at lower 
temperatures in comparison to DTBP, generally comprised 
between 65° and 85°C, with reaction times lower than 6 hours. 
The low polymerization temperature allows to obtain a PVDF 
having high mechanical properties, since the structural 
defects are drastically reduced and therefore the 
crystallinity of the product is higher. The PVDF obtained with the low temperature process 
mentioned above, though having high crystallinity degree and 
very good mechanical characteristics, shows poor thermochemical 
resistance to dehydrofluorination. In fact, on the 
basis of the experimentation carried out by the Applicant, it 
has been found that the PVDF obtained at low temperature, if 
submitted to high temperatures (over 100°C) or contacted with 
basic solutions (for instance NaOH at 10%), tends to 
dehydrofluorinating, with formation in the chain of conjugated 
double bonds of the -CF=CH-CF=CH- type. The formation of such 
structural defects, besides conferring undesired colorations,  
 
lowers considerably the mechanical resistance of the material, 
as shown by measurements of chemical stress cracking. Moreover, the low temperature process
