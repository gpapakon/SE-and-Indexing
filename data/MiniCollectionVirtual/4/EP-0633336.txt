<ABSTRACT>
In the method, the weft insertion takes place with a weft thread constantly threaded in and with a presented weft thread in each case, the weft threads being guided along separate running paths, in order to prevent the threads from rolling over. For this purpose, an arrangement has a feed gripper (1) containing two recesses (14, 15) which are intended for taking over and advancing the weft threads (3, 4) respectively in the middle of the loom by the receive gripper, spatially away from the said feed gripper.
