<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of coating a product, 
wherein a product is treated with a solution of an alginate 

and rice starch having a viscosity of 30-150 poises measured 
at room temperature, the weight ratio between the alginate and 

the rice starch varying from 6:1 to 50:1, which product 
contains polyvalent cations, and/or wherein a suitable gelling 

agent is added to the treated product. The invention also 
relates to the application of a composition comprising rice 

starch and alginate in a weight ratio of between 1:1 and 1:50 
as packing material; the application of a composition 

comprising rice starch and alginate in a weight ratio of 
between 1:1 and 1:3 as laminate; and the application of a 

composition comprising rice starch and alginate in a weight 
ratio of between 1:6 and 1:50 as band coating for cheese.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of coating a product, 
wherein a product is treated with a solution of an alginate 
and rice starch, and to the use of a composition comprising 
rice starch and alginate in specific weight ratios as packing 
material, laminate and band coating for cheese. In this specification, by the term "alginate" is meant a 
hydrocolloid or a macromolecular polysaccharide substantially 
composed of molecules of mannuronic acid and/or glucuronic 
acid, more in particular of D-mannuronic acid and/or L-glucuronic 
acid, also referred to as L-guluronic acid. In food 
industry, alginates are mainly used as stabilizers, gelling 
and thickening agents. In many cases, these hydrocolloids are 
attractive because of the strong viscosity-increasing and gel-forming 
capacity coupled to a relatively low cost price. The most conventional raw material for alginate is brown 
seaweed, more in particular brown seaweed of the types 
Macrocystis, Laminaria and Ascophyllum. In these weeds, 
alginates are present as alginic acid and the sodium, 
potassium, calcium and magnesium salts thereof. The alginate 
is extracted from this raw material by boiling out the weed 
with a lye solution to extract alginic acid. Subsequently, 
this acid can be precipitated as an insoluble calcium salt, 
further purified and reconverted into the acid. From alginic 
acid the alginate salts may be prepared, if desired. Sodium 
alginate is used most in the food industry. For a more 
detailed survey of the isolation of alginates from brown 
seaweed, reference can for instance be made to Kirk-Othmer, 
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, third Edition, Volume 12, 
(1980) John Wiley & Sons, New York, page 52, and the article 
"Alginaten breed toepasbaar in levensmiddelenindustrie" from 
Food Management, December 1989, pages 42 and 43. Water-soluble alginates, and more in particular sodium 
alginates, react with different polyvalent cations to form 
gels. This can be used for film formation. Of the polyvalent 
cations that can be used, calcium ions are the most effective 
as a gelling agent. In essence, there are two methods for  
 
gelling alginates, dissolved in water, under the influence of 
polyvalent cations. In this connection, reference is made to 
Food Technology, December 1986, page 50. For instance, polyvalent cations can be released 
homogeneously and gradually in an alginate solution or 
suspension, so that a uniform gelling occurs. This can be 
established by dispersing a polyvalent cation salt, for 
instance a
