<ABSTRACT>
A planking for firing, free from thermal deformation and having a long life; and a method of firing a 
ceramic molded product by using this planking, which method can prevent the occurrence of distortion of ribs of, 

and deformation and discoloring of an end surface of, and cracks in, a honeycomb structure. The planking for firing 
consists mainly of 55-85 % by weight of cordierite and 15-45 % by weight of mullite, and a raw ceramic molded 

product is placed on such a planking and fired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to underlying
boards particularly suitable for firing ceramics and a
method for firing ceramic moldings by using such
underlying boards.It is heretofore a common practice that when,
for example, green ceramic honeycomb structural bodies
are to be fired, the structural bodies are fired in a
tunnel kiln or a periodic kiln, while being placed on a
shelf plate. In order to prevent cracking of the
structural body and bonding between the structural body
and the shelf plate, the green ceramic honeycomb
structural bodies are fired in the state that the
structural bodies are placed on the shelf plate through
underlying boards called setters without being directly
placed on the shelf plate.Japanese patent publication No. 1-54,636
discloses, as an example of the underlying board, a
setter made of a ceramic plate with a honeycomb
structure and having a burred portion at an upper edge.
For example, when a honeycomb structural body composed 
mainly of cordierite is to be fired, it is a common
practice to employ an underlying board made of the same
material (100% cordierite) as that of the honeycomb
structural body so as to make the shrinkage factor equal
between the underlying board and the honeycomb
structural body to be fired.FR-A-2 347 321 discloses a fire resistant ceramic honeycomb material
comprising mainly cordierite and not more than 20 wt.-% of spinel, mullite
and/or corundum.However, in the case of the above-mentioned
firing underlying boards, there are problems that as the
number of times of passing the board through the tunnel
kiln increases, the underlying board is warped with
heat, and the surface of the structural body becomes
coarse due to melting-out of a silica component so that
the under end face of the honeycomb structural body is
deformed, ribs of the honeycomb structural body are
twisted and/or the structural body is cracked.
Particularly, if the underlying board made of 100%
cordierite is used in a tunnel kiln, the above troubles
such as warping and melting-out of the silica component
are conspicuous, because such an underlying board has
poor resistance against direct flame from a burner of
the tunnel kiln. Owing to this, the conventional
underlying boards have the problem that the number of
times of passing through the tunnel kiln may be as short
as 15-20.It is an object of the present invention is to
solve the above-mentioned problems, and is to provide a 
firing underlying board which has a long service life
free from thermal deformation and which does not
