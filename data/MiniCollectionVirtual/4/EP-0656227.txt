<ABSTRACT>
The process is intended for use in fast food outlets and involves fashioning a number of layers of a food paste made from 
various types of food product such as a fruit/vegetable paste, cheese/dairy paste, meat or fish. Each layer is individually shaped 

and undergoes heat treatment in a separate chamber, the latter being carried out by passing an alternating electric current 
through the food product until the layer is cooked. Finished layers are put together and receive the finished food product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to food industry and in particular 
to methods of manufacturing composite food products with the 
use of electric current treatment. It has previously been proposed to manufacture a composite 
food item from minced meat or mixed meat-and-fish pastes 
forming high-porous and dense layers feasibly interlayed with 
cheese dust, spices, etc. (see US patent No. 4781929, Int. Cl. 
A23P1/325, 1988). According to this method, prefabricated layers 
are bonded sandwichlike or in the shape of a stick, wrapped 
in a sausage casing and undergo heat treatment by means of 
boiling followed by steaming. On finishing the heat treatment 
the sausage casing is removed from the resulting food item. The disadvantages of the prior art invention are the process 
complexity (it consists of a great number of various manipulations) 
and its long duration. Besides, the process deals 
with closely related starting materials composing the multilayer 
item which makes it difficult to produce composite food 
products varied in gustatory qualities and at the same time 
well balanced over the whole set of necessary nutritive constituents.  My invention is directed to such a process for producing 
multilayer food items that would enable to make food products 
with various high gustatory qualities, well balanced from the 
point of principle nutritive constituents, such as albumens, 
carbohydrates, vitamines and other biologically active matters. 
On the other hand, the invention is aimed at substantial 
processing time cut and consederable technologic facilitation. To ahieve the aforesaid objects, the present process for 
multilayer food item manufacturing involves fashioning the layers 
of food pastes, treating them with heat and putting the 
cooked layers together. The food paste layers are fashioned on 
base of different principal constituents, the prosesses of moulding 
and heat treatment of each layer are performed individually, 
in a separate chamber, with the heat treatment being 
performed by passing alternating electric current through the 
food component, i.e. the electric heating is based here on the 
principle of electric resistance. The heat treatment process 
is terminated after the food paste layer is considered to be 
cooked, that is ready to eat; thereupon the layers are removed 
out of the chambers and put together. It is to be understood 
that in this context, by the "types" of food we mean vegetable, 
meat, fish or dairy products, hence it is obvious that here 
food pastes may be of

Process for producing multilayer food item comprising 
fashioning a number of food paste layers, heating them and 

putting together, characterized by the layers being made from 
different types of food product, each layer being individually 

shaped and subject to heat treatment in a separate chamber, 
the latter operation being carried out by passing alternating 

electric current through the food layer until it is cooked.
