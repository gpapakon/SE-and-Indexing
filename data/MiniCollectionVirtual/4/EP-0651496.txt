<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a core (1) for an electric machine 
comprising injecting thixotropic material such as a copper alloy into the 

slots of a stack of laminations (2), the thixotropic material forming a 
cage (3) holding the laminations together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric machine. The rotor of an electric machine e g an induction motor conventionally 
comprises laminations stamped from sheets of electrical steel. During 
manufacture these laminations are placed on top of each other to form a 
cylindrical stack, and the stack placed in a press. Metal is then injected by 
a die casting process into slots formed in the stack to form a plurality of 
conductors extending along the length thereof. Two circular end rings are 
also moulded, one at each end of the stack, to connect the ends of the 
conductors. The combination of end rings and conductors so formed is 
known as a cage. Figure 1 of the drawings shows a completed core (which 
is the rotor in a finished motor) and Figure 2 shows the cage remaining after 
the laminations have been etched away. The cage is required to have sufficient structural strength to hold the 
stack of laminations tightly in position during use of the motor, to have good 
electrical conductivity and to be relatively inexpensive to manufacture. 
Although it is known to manufacture cores with die cast copper cages, 
because of the high melting point of copper it is found that the high 
temperature die casting can cause damage to the end ring forming dies. 
Thus most motor cores are manufactured with die cast aluminium cages, 
since the melting point of aluminium is lower than that of copper. This 
results in less damage being caused to the end ring dies but by using 
aluminium, which has a lower electrical conductivity compared with that of 
copper, there is a consequential loss in motor efficiency. It is an object of the present invention to provide a manufacturing 
method for a core which suffers less from the aforementioned disadvantages. In accordance with the invention a method of manufacturing a core for 
an electric machine comprises forming a plurality of laminations, each having 
a plurality of slots, each slot being located at or near to the periphery of the 
lamination, positioning the laminations in a stack with the slots of the 
laminations in alignment to provide at least one elongated space extending 
through the stack, injecting thixotropic material into the space and allowing  
 
the material to set to form a cage, the stack of laminations being held 
together by the cage to provide the core. End rings are also formed, one at each end of the stack, from the 
thixotropic material, said rings also forming part of the cage. The injection is preferably carried out at a temperature below the 
solidus
