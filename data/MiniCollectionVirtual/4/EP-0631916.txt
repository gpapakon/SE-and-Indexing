<ABSTRACT>
The double-deck railway sleeping car has top and bottom compartments reached from a single corridor along one side of the carriage. Each compartment has two bunks (2F,3) placed one above the other. The bunks are designed to convert into seats for day use. The bottom bunk (3) may be fixed and can be used as the seat while the top bunk (2F) may be folded up out of the way, and part of it may form the backrest for the seat. The bottom bunk may be movable to reveal a fixed seat underneath.

Interior fittings of a sleeping or reclining 
compartment, particularly for railway vehicles, comprising 

at least two reclining surfaces which are arranged 
one above the other, have longitudinal and end sides and 

for the purpose of using the compartment in the daytime 
as a sitting compartment can be folded out of a night 

position into a day position in order to provide seating 
accommodation, characterized in that on both reclining 

surfaces (2, 3) at least one swivel axis (10, 11, 12; 
10') extending parallel to an end side is provided, and 

in that for the purpose of obtaining the day position one 
of the reclining surfaces (3) can be swivelled about its 

swivel axis (12) to a position in front of the other 
reclining surface (2), which has been folded away, such 

that it conceals the latter. 
Interior fittings according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that in the day position the reclining surface 

(2) which is to be concealed can be folded up at at least 
one joint (8), which can be locked in the extended day 

position and whose hinge axis extends parallel to the 
swivel axis (10, 10'). 
Interior fittings according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the joint (8) for folding up the reclining 

surface (2) is arranged at least approximately in the 
region of the centre of the latter, so that the reclining 

surface can be folded up into a half-length package. 
Interior fittings according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that, at least during the folding-up of 

the reclining surface (2), the axis of the joint (8) can 
be lowered relative to the level of said reclining  

 
surface (2) situated in the night position. 
Interior fittings according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, 
characterized in that on the upper reclining surface (2), 

which can be folded up at the joint (8), there are also 
provided two swivel axes (10, 11) which are each 

arranged, on both sides of the joint (8), on a respective 
portion (2S, 2F) and which are guided in a guide (9), at 

least for sliding, relative to a compartment partition 
(6) adjoining one longitudinal side of said reclining 

surface (2). 
Interior fittings according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, 
characterized in that on the upper reclining surface, 

which can be folded up at the joint (8), there is provided 
only one fixed swivel axis (10'), which is mounted 

on both sides and about which the reclining surface (2) 
folded up on the joint (8) can be folded away as a whole, 

at least into a day position, the axis of the joint (8) 
being raised above the level of the reclining surface in 

the night position. 
Interior fittings according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that in the folded-out position a 

portion (2S) of the upper reclining surface rests on the 
bottom of a niche and the swivel axis (10, 10') provided 

on said portion (2S) is supported on both sides both on 
a compartment partition and on a side wall of the niche 

on the compartment side. 
Interior fittings according to one of the preceding 
claims, in a vehicle provided with a side corridor 

connecting successive compartments, characterized in that 
the swivel axes (10, 12) for folding away the reclining 

surfaces (2, 3) are arranged near the side corridor but 
in the reclining region between the two short end sides 

of the reclining surfaces (2, 3). 
Interior fittings according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that a (head) part (3S), near the side corridor, 

of the lower reclining surface (3) is fixed and the 
swivel axis (12) is arranged between the part (3S) near 

the side corridor and the longer remaining part (3F) of 
the reclining surface (3).  

 
Interior fittings according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the lower reclining surface (3) is 

swivellable as a single part about the swivel axis (12), 
which is offset, relative to the end side near the side 

corridor, towards the compartment, its (head) part (3S) 
near the side corridor moving towards the compartment 

floor when passing into the day position.
