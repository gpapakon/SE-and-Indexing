<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plasma jet 
torch equipped with a constrained chip through whose 
nozzle a plasma generated by gas discharge is jetted, and 
the constrained chip is made of a metal, is forcedly 
cooled and functions as one discharge electrode. More 
specifically, it relates to a material and a shape of the 
constrained chip mounted on a tip of plasma jet torch. The present invention relates also to the use of such a plasma jet. Plasma cutting techniques can be classified into a 
plasma arc cutting method by which a metal can be cut, and 
a plasma jet cutting method by which a metal and a nonmetal 
can be cut. As shown in Fig. 1, the plasma jet cutting 
method uses an apparatus in which a plasma jet power 
source 14 and a high-frequency generator 16 are connected 
between a tungsten electrode 10 and a water-cooling constrained 
chip 12 made of oxygen-free copper. The cutting 
operation of the plasma jet cutting method will be carried 
out as follows: In the first place, a working gas (e.g., 
an argon gas) is caused to flow between the tungsten 
electrode 10 and the constrained chip 12, and the high-frequency 
generator 16 is then operated to discharge a 
high-frequency arc, thereby destroying the electric insulation  
 
of the working gas and forming an ionized electric 
passage. An arc current continuously flows from the 
plasma jet power source 14 through the working gas, and at 
this time, a plasma flow 20 is generated by arc heat. 
This heat of the plasma flow 20 is utilized to cut an 
article 22 to be cut. According to this method, the plasma flow 20 is 
jetted through the nozzle of the constrained chip 12 by 
the thermal expansion of the plasma gas itself. Thus, the 
arc current does not flow through the article 22 to be 
cut, in contrast to the plasma arc cutting method. For 
this reason, the plasma jet cutting method also permits 
the cutting of non-conductive materials (e.g., fire bricks 
and concretes). However, an energy density of the generated 
high-temperature plasma flow rapidly declines, as the 
plasma flow jetted through the nozzle leaves the nozzle, 
and therefore the thermal efficiency of the plasma jet 
cutting method is as low as 10 to 20%. In consequence, 
this cutting method cannot be considered to be an efficient 
cutting technique. Accordingly, the plasma jet 
cutting method has not usually been put to practical use, 
and as a commercially available product, only a 30A grade 
torch for cutting acrylic plates has been present. However, articles to be cut are not
