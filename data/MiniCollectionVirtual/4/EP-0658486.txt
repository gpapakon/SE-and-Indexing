<ABSTRACT>
The container for transporting goods exhibiting a receptacle part (2) and a lid part (1) is noteworthy in that the locking means consist of tongues (2a) (1a) forcibly interacting under the effect of elastic deformation of the container, the said tongues being equipped, at their end, with complementary hooking elements (2a1) (1a1), the said tongues being formed so that they extend beyond the internal faces of the lid and of the receptacle, set back from the corresponding peripheral edge, so that they fall within the volume of the container, the arrangements (2d) being such as to immobilise the complementary tongues (2a) (1a) in the position in which the lid is locked, the said arrangements being attached to the corresponding edges of the lid by lines of articulation which have a reduced thickness so as to be detachable.
