<ABSTRACT>
A switching cell arrangement is described, especially for medium-voltage switching installations, having at least two cells which are arranged adjacent and next to one another, each contain a switch and are closed at the top by pressure-relief flaps which are mounted such that they can pivot. The pivoting axes (shafts) of the pressure-relief flaps are arranged essentially parallel to one another. In the closed state, the pivoting axis of the pressure-relief flap of one cell faces the free end of the pressure-relief flap of the adjacent cell on the pivoting-axis side. In consequence, in the event of a defect in one cell, its adjacent cell on the pivoting-axis side is protected by the pivoting-up pressure-relief flap of the cell affected by the defect, and the pressure-relief flap of the neighbouring cell which is arranged on the opposite side of the affected cell cannot be lifted up on the side facing the affected cell by the suction occurring in the event of the defect being in the region between the pressure-relief flaps and the space cover (room ceiling).

Switching cell arrangement, in particular for medium 
voltage installations, comprising at least two adjacent 

cells (1, 2, 12) which are arranged directly alongside 
one another and which each contain a switch, with the 

cells being closed at the lid side by pivotally mounted 
pressure relief flaps (5, 6, 14), with the pivot axes 

(3, 4, 13) of the pressure relief flaps (5, 6, 14) being 
arranged substantially parallel to one another and with 

the pivot axes (3, 4) of the pressure relief flap (5, 6) 
of one cell (1, 2) being respectively positioned, in the 

closed state, adjacent to the free end (19, 18) of the 
pressure relief flap (14, 5) of the adjacent cell (12, 

1) at the pivot axis side, characterised in that the 
pressure relief flaps (5) are each pivotable into a 

screening position in which they respectively cover over 
at least the free end (19, 9) of the pressure relief 

flap (14, 6) of the adjacent cell (12, 2) at the pivot 
axis side and thereby respectively prevent upward pivoting 

of this pressure relief flap (14, 6), so that with a 
fault in one cell (1) the cell (12, 2) adjacent the cell 

(1) effected by the fault at the pivot axis side is protected 
by the upwardly pivoting pressure relief flap 

(5). 
Switching cell arrangement, in particular for medium 
voltage installations, comprising at least one cell (20) 

containing a switch and closed at the lid side by at 
least one pivotally journalled pressure relief flap 

(27), characterised in that the cell (20) has two pressure 
relief flaps (27, 28) which, in the closed state, 

substantially fully overlap and the pivot axes (29, 30)  
 

of which are arranged substantially at a right angle to 
one another. 
Switching cell arrangement in accordance with claim 2, 
characterised in that with cells (20, 21, 22, 23) arranged 

alongside one another and at the same time behind 
one another, at least those cells (20) which have at 

least one side neighbouring cell and also one rear 
neighbouring cell (21, 22, 23) each have two pressure 

relief flaps (27, 28), and in that the cells (20, 21, 
22, 23) are so arranged alongside one another and behind 

one another that in the closed state the pivot axis (29, 
30, 31) of each pressure relief flap (27, 28, 24) of one 

cell (20, 21) is respectively adjacent the free end (34, 
33, 32) of a pressure relief flap (26, 25, 28) of the 

adjacent cell (23, 22, 20) at the pivot axis side. 
Switching cell arrangement in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the cells (1, 2, 

12, 20, 21, 22, 23) are formed as mutually partitioned 
cell sections of a switch cabinet. 
Switching cell arrangement in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the pressure relief 

flaps (5, 6, 14, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28) of different 
cells (1, 2, 12, 21, 22, 23, 20) are arranged substantially 

in the same plane. 
Switching cell arrangement in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the area of the 

pressure relief flaps (5, 6, 14, 24, 25, 26) respectively 
embrace only a part of the lid area of the cells 

(1, 2, 12, 21, 22, 23, 20).  
 
Switching cell arrangement, in particular for medium 
voltage installations, comprising at least one cell (1) 

containing a switch and closed at the lid side by at 
least one pivotally journalled pressure relief flap (5), 

in particular in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a further pivotally journalled 

flap (37) is provided at the lid side, in addition 
to the pressure relief flap (5), in particular on a 

low-voltage section (35) of the cell (1), with the pivot 
axis (36) of this flap (27) being arranged adjacent the 

free end (18) of the neighbouring pressure relief flap 
(5), so that the flap (37) is lifted with a fault in the 

cell (1) through the suction (8) which arises and acts 
as a deflection flap for an arc (11). 
Switching cell arrangement in accordance with claim 7, 
characterised in that deflection flap (37) is arranged 

at a higher level than the adjacent pressure relief flap 
(5).
