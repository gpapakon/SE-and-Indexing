<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging element for making 
improved offset printing plates according to the silver salt 
diffusion transfer process. Furthermore the present invention 
relates to a method for making improved offset printing plates with 
said imaging element. The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal 
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in 
US-P 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion 
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London 
and New York, (1972). In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an 
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into 
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into 
an image receiving layer and are reduced therein with a developing 
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to 
form a silver image having reversed image density values 
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the 
exposed areas of the photographic material. A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic 
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the 
water-repellant-ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive 
ink-repellant background. The DTR-image can be formed in the image 
receiving layer of a sheet or web material which is a separate 
element with respect to the photographic silver halide emulsion 
material (a so-called two-sheet DTR element) or in the image 
receiving layer of a so-called single-support-element, also called 
mono-sheet element, which contains at least one photographic silver 
halide emulsion layer integral with an image receiving layer in 
waterpermeable relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet 
version which is preferred for the preparation of offset printing 
plates by the DTR method. Two main types of mono-sheet DTR materials that are distinct  
 
because of their different layer arrangement and processing are 
known. The first type of mono-sheet DTR material comprises on a 
support, generally paper or a resin support such as polyester, in 
the order given a silver halide emulsion layer and an image 
receiving layer containing physical development nuclei as a surface 
layer. After information-wise exposure and development according to 
the DTR process a silver image is formed in the surface layer. 
Since the underlying layers are hydrophilic in nature and the silver 
image
