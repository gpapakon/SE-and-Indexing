<ABSTRACT>
Process for producing finely divided, essentially amorphic colorant or active compound preparations by converting a relatively coarsely particulate dispersion or a solution into a colloidal distribution state in water, the colloidal distribution being generated at a temperature above the melting point of the colorant or active compound by adding appropriately hot water (if necessary under pressure) or an aqueous protective colloidal solution, so that an emulsion is formed of a melt in an aqueous medium, which emulsion is immediately spray-dried or is converted into a suspension by cooling.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing fine-particle, essentially amorphous
dye or drug preparations by converting a relatively

coarse-particle dispersion having a particle size of about 1
to 2000 Âµm or a solution of the dye or drug in an organic

solvent which is at least 10% water-soluble into a colloidal
dispersion in water, wherein the aqueous dispersion or

organic solution of the dye or drug is subjected to turbulent
mixing at a temperature above the melting point of the dye or

drug (where appropriate under pressure) with water or an
aqueous protective colloid solution, and the resulting melt

emulsion is immediately spray-dried or converted into a
suspension by cooling.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein no organic solvent
is used.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the cooling
takes place as quickly as possible after the formation of the

hot melt emulsion.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein water
or water/solvent mixture is removed from the resulting suspension

by spray drying or spray granulation to afford an
easily redispersable powder.
