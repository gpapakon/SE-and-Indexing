<ABSTRACT>
Organic carbonates which contain at least one aromatic ester group can be obtained in a continuous manner from carbonates which contain at least one aliphatic ester group, and a phenolic compound, in the presence of a transesterification catalyst known per se by carrying out the reaction in a bubble column reactor or in a cascade of at least two bubble columns such that the phenolic compound is metered into the first bubble column and the carbonate containing at least one aliphatic ester group is metered into each individual bubble column, but preferably only into the last bubble column. The carbonate containing at least one aromatic ester group is removed from the last bubble column in liquid form. Volatile reaction products, e.g. eliminated alcohol or a dialkyl carbonate, are removed at the upper end of each individual bubble column, preferably at the upper end of the first bubble column.
