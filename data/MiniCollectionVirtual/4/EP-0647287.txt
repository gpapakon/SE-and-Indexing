<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for drying of a cellulosic fibrous structure having constant basis weight and/or density or multiple regions varying in basis weight and/or density. Such a cellulosic fibrous structure may have a nonuniform moisture distribution prior to drying by the disclosed method and apparatus. An equally or more uniform moisture distribution is achieved by providing a micropore medium in the air flow path which has a greater flow resistance than the interstices between the fibers in the cellulosic fibrous structure web. The micropore medium is the limiting orifice in the air flow used in the drying process. The micropore medium may be executed in a laminate of plural laminae, each of successively increasing or decreasing pore size. This arrangement provides the advantage that minimal sagging or deformation of each lamina into the next coarser lamina occurs and lateral air flow between the micropore medium and the cellulosic fibrous structure is reduced. The micropore medium may be disposed either upstream or downstream in the air flow path of the cellulosic fibrous structure to be through-air dried.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cellulosic fibrous structures, and particularly to
cellulosic fibrous structures having an embryonic web which is through-air dried.Cellulosic fibrous structures have become a staple of everyday life. Cellulosic
fibrous structures are found in facial tissues, toilet tissues and paper toweling.One recent advance in the art of cellulosic fibrous structures is to provide multiple
regions in the cellulosic fibrous structure. A cellulosic fibrous structure is considered to
have multiple regions when one region of the cellulosic fibrous structure differs in either
basis weight, density, or both, from an adjacent region of the cellulosic fibrous structure.Multiple regions in a cellulosic fibrous structure provide the advantage of
economization ofthe fibers used in manufacture. Furthermore, the regions can be tailored
to different functions desired by the consumer of the cellulosic fibrous structure.
Functions such as providing absorbency, tensile strength and even opacity may be
provided by the different regions.In the manufacture of cellulosic fibrous structures, a wet embryonic web of
cellulosic fibers dispersed in a liquid carrier is deposited onto a forming wire. The wet
embryonic web may be dried by any one of or combinations of several known means, each
of which drying means will affect the properties of the resulting cellulosic fibrous
structure. For example, the drying means and process can influence the softness, caliper,
tensile strength, and absorbency of the resulting cellulosic fibrous structure. Also the 
means and process used to dry the cellulosic fibrous structure affects the rate at which it
can be manufactured, without being rate limited by such drying means and process.An example of one drying means is felt belts. Felt drying belts have long been used
to dewater an embryonic cellulosic fibrous structure through capillary flow of the liquid
carrier into a permeable felt medium held in contact with the embryonic web. However,
dewatering a cellulosic fibrous structure into and by using a felt belt results in overall
uniform compression and compaction of the embryonic cellulosic fibrous structure web to
be dried.Felt belt drying may be assisted by a vacuum, or may be assisted by opposed press
rolls. The press rolls maximize the mechanical compression of the felt against the
cellulosic fibrous structure. Examples of felt belt drying are illustrated in U.S. Patent
4,329,201 issued May 11, 1982 to Bolton and U.S. Patent 4,888,096 issued December 19,
1989 to Cowan

<CLAIMS>
A process for limiting-orifice-through-air drying a cellulosic fibrous
structure (10), said process comprising the steps of:


providing a cellulosic embryonic web (21) to be dried and having a
moisture distribution therein;
providing a drying belt (28) which is air
permeable to support said embryonic web (21);
providing a means for causing air flow through said embryonic web
(21) and said drying belt (28);
disposing said embryonic web (21)
on said drying belt (28);

characterized by

providing a micropore medium (30) on the side of said embryonic
web (21) opposite said drying belt (28), so that said embryonic web (21) is intermediate said drying belt (28)

and said micropore medium (30), said micropore medium (30)
being the limiting orifice for said air flow;
causing air flow through said drying belt
(28), said embryonic web (21) and said micropore medium (30),

so that said moisture distribution is equally or more uniform after air
flow through said embryonic web (21).
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said air flow through said
embryonic web (21) is in the direction from said drying belt (28) to

said micropore medium (30).
A process according to Claim 1 wherein said air flow through said
embryonic web is in the direction from said micropore medium (30)

to said drying belt (28).
An apparatus for limited-orifice-through-air drying an embryonic
web (21) of cellulosic fibers having moisture distributed therein,

said apparatus comprising:

a through-air drying belt (28) for supporting the embryonic web (21)
and in contacting relationship with one face thereof, and
a means to
cause airflow through the embryonic web (21) and said drying belt

(28);

characterised in that

a micropore medium (30) is disposed on the opposite side of the
embryonic web (21), such that air is caused to flow through said

drying belt (28), 
said embryonic web (21) and said micropore medium (30);
wherein said micropore medium (30) is the limiting orifice for said
airflow, so that said moisture

distribution is equally or more uniform after air flow through said embryonic web (21).
