<ABSTRACT>
A water-absorbent water-insoluble fibre or film is produced by extruding an aqueous solution of a water-soluble polymer into a gaseous medium to form fibre or film. The extruded fibre or film is collected at a moisture content of 8 to 25 % based on the dry weight of the fibre or film and is further dried at a temperture no greater than 100  C before crosslinking the fibre or film at a temperature in the range 125 to 250  C to a degree sufficient that the crosslinked fibre or film is water-insoluble. The fibre or film entering the crosslinking step has a moisture content which is reduced, preferably by at least 5 %, and which is in the range 0 to 10 %. Heat-crosslinked fibre is preferably treated with moist air after crosslinking to raise the moisture content of the fibre to at least 10 %, particularly if the fibre is for textile processing. Water-absorbent water-insoluble coatings can be produced by a similar process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of producing water-absorbent 
shaped articles such as fibre or film, including 
free-standing film and film coated on a surface. It is known to produce fibre or film of polymeric 
material which is capable of absorbing large quantities of 
water or other liquids. One method of manufacturing such 
fibre or film is to use as a starting material a water-soluble 
polymer which can be crosslinked under the action of 
heat. The polymeric material is dissolved in water to form 
an aqueous solution which is then extruded into a heated 
gaseous environment. This produces fibre or film of the 
water-soluble polymer, which is dried by the heated gaseous 
environment into which the material is extruded. The 
extruded fibre or film is subsequently heated to crosslink 
the polymer to such a degree that it is water-insoluble but 
water-absorbent. Without the crosslinking step the fibre or film will redissolve 
should it ever encounter water subsequently. The 
crosslinking step, therefore, stabilises the fibre or film 
so that on encountering water it absorbs the water without 
dissolving. The more the material is heated and crosslinked 
the less capable the product is of absorbing water, but in 
general terms the more stable the material is and the more 
it retains its structure on absorbing water, that is to say 
the more the fibre retains its fibrous nature. The exact 
amount of crosslinking and heating can be varied depending 
upon the uses to which the water-absorbent fibre or film is 
to be put. EP-A-268498 describes a water-absorbent water-insoluble 
polymeric fibre, film, coating, bonding layer or foam, made 
by forming a substantially linear polymer by polymerisation  
 
of water-soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomer blends 
comprising carboxylic and hydroxylic monomers and then 
reacting the carboxylic and hydroxylic monomers in the 
linear polymer to form internal crosslinks within the 
polymer. EP-A-269393 describes a water-absorbent water-insoluble 
crosslinked polymer fibre or film made by dry extrusion of 
a solution of a substantially linear polymer formed from a 
water-soluble blend of monoethylenically unsaturated 
monomers comprising a plasticising monomer, evaporating the 
solvent and forming polymeric fibre or film plasticised by 
an external plasticiser, stretching the fibre or film while 
the external plasticiser remains in the fibre or film, and 
then crosslinking the polymer. EP-A-342919 describes film or fibre made by extrusion and 
stretching from a
