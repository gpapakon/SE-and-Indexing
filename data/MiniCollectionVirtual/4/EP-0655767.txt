<ABSTRACT>
Glass discoloration by high energy electrons is 
avoided by applying a thin oxide layer on the surface of 

the glass that would otherwise be impacted by electrons, 
which is alkali-free, contains no ions inherently reducible 

by electron bombardment, and has a thickness larger than 
the depth of penetration of the electron beam at a given 

acceleration potential but insufficient color to interfere 
with desired color coordinate specifications. 

Suitable thin oxide layers comprise ZnO, SnO₂, In₂O₃ and 
tin-doped indium oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method of preventing electron discoloration caused by 
high energy electron bombardment of glass, and cathode ray 
tube. Prolonged exposure of oxide glasses to energetic 
electrons induces optical absorption, of particular 
practical significance in cathode ray tubes (CRT,) causing 
permanent browning of the screen. Considerable effort has been expended to alter the 
panel glass composition in order to minimize this browning 
effect. Lead oxide exacerbates the browning. However, 
lead is beneficial because of its high stopping power for 
x-rays that are produced by the electron beam, and as it 
imparts desirable physical properties to the glass. In 
lead-free glasses browning is reduced, but still 
significant. While alkali-free glasses do not brown under an 
equivalent amount of electron beam dose, they are not 
suitable for melting and forming the panel glass for CRT. United States Patents 3,573,955 and 3,725,710 propose 
providing a thin, hard, transparent layer containing no 
more than 1% of easily reduced metal oxides between the 
window portion of a CRT and a phosphor layer inside the  
 
window leaching out lead and ion exchanging potassium ions 
for sodium, or other means of coating the window to provide 
the protective layer. Recent higher accelerating voltages of 30-40 kV 
increase browning against which these films are no longer 
effective. Furthermore, the protective film must adhere to 
the glass during subsequent CRT production steps, a serious 
concern if the film must be thicker than about one micron. In particular, the continual increase in size from 38 
cm (15") windows to 89 cm (35") windows imposes practical 
limits on the manner in which films are applied. Also, a 
blank tube undergoes thermal cycling before it becomes a 
completed CRT. Film thickness must be limited to provide 
adequate adherence to withstand the differential thermal 
expansion effect that is encountered during this subsequent 
thermal cycling. The present invention provides a practical method of 
providing protection, in modern cathode ray tubes, against 
discoloration due to electron bombardment, and meeting the 
various concerns described above, and providing a greater 
flexibility in the procedure for applying a protective 
film. It further provides a CRT having improved protection 
against discoloration (browning) due to electron 
bombardment. The product aspect of the invention resides in a 
cathode ray tube comprising an envelope having a glass 
window portion capable of being discolored upon bombardment

In a cathode ray tube comprising an envelope having a 
glass window portion capable of being discolored upon 

bombardment by high energy electrons, means mounted in the 
tube to produce a stream of high energy electrons and to

the window, the tube characterized by an oxide film between 

the window and the phosphor layer, the film being alkali-free, 
free of ions inherently reducible by electron 

bombardment, and of sufficient thickness and density to 
prevent any substantial electron penetration to the window. 
A cathode ray tube in accordance with claim 1 in which 
the thin film is free of lead, titanium and bismuth ions. 
A cathode ray tube in accordance with claim 1 in which 
the stream of high energy electrons is directed at the 

window at an accelerating potential of at least 20 kV. 
A cathode ray tube in accordance with claim 1 in which 
the thin film is free of any coloration greater than that 

which, in conjunction with any colorants in the window, 
will provide a desired tint. 
A cathode ray tube in accordance with claim 1 in which 
the thickness of the thin film is sufficient so that, after

penetration of electrons to the glass is minimal and has

vapor deposition, or by coating with a gel and firing, or 
from a organo-metallic precursor.
