<ABSTRACT>
A sheathing for optical fibres and for optical fibre cables comprises a continuous length of tubing with the tubing walls being designed to allow the tube to be bent to a predetermined radius but to hinder its bending to a radius smaller than the predetermined radius. The tube walls (12) include portions (18) which are spaced apart when the tube is straight, but abut one another at (20) when the tube is bent to the predetermined radius.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to optical fibre sheathing and
particularly to protective sheathing for supporting and
limiting the bend radius of optical fibre or optical fibre
cable. The invention is applicable in situations where the
fibre might have to follow a tight bend, for example
adjacent to a connector board, in cable runs or in trunking.The term "optical fibre" will be used in the rest of this
specification to refer to both fibre alone and to optical
fibre cable.If an optical fibre is bent tightly, ie to a radius which is
smaller than a critical radius, there is a significant
increase in the transmission losses of the fibre. Below the
critical radius the fibre no longer acts efficiently as a
waveguide and so it is important to ensure that optical
fibre as used in telecommunications and data communications
is not bent below this critical radius. The problem is
particularly apparent where it is necessary to have a large
number of fibres connected through a single patch panel.It is known to provide strain relief and/or bend limitation
at the end of a fibre, where the fibre enters a fitting.
Devices which provide such relief or bend limitation are
known for example from EP 0,260,774, from DE 3,821,017 and
from GB 2,142,788.To prevent the breakage of strands, JP-58048005 discloses
the provision of projecting parts at intervals on the
circumferential surface of an optical fibre cable. A
tensile reinforcement is provided around a core of an
optical fibre. A fibre coating of a soft and thick-walled
synthetic resin is coated on the exterior of the 
reinforcement. Small circular parts of a small diameter and
large circular parts of a large diameter are formed
alternately on the exterior to complete an optical fibre
cable. If the cable is bent sharply, the edges of the large
circular parts come into contact with one another on the
inside of the bend and prevent further bending.It is also known from GB-A-2 080 970 to surround a fibre
cable with a wrapping of tough fibres, with the wrapping
being surrounded by an extruded coating, also to control
bending of the cable and it is further known from JP 59-31902
to surround a fibre with a longitudinally split, bend-limited
pipe which has clips to close the longitudinal split
once the tube has been fitted over the fibre.It is known to produce continuous lengths of tubing by
extrusion, and it is also known that extruded tubing can be
used as a sheath for protecting cables.GB-A-2 080 970 describes an optical fibre sheathing
comprising a continuous length of tube made up
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An optical fibre sheathing comprising a continuous
length of tube (10) having a smooth internal bore in which

an optical fibre can be loosely accommodated, the tube wall
(12) being adapted to permit bending of the tube until a

predetermined radius of curvature has been reached, but to
hinder bending of the tube beyond the predetermined radius

of curvature, the tube (10) being extruded from a single
plastics material, and the outer wall (12) of the tube being

formed with circumferential grooves (18) which extend part
of the way through the tube wall to permit bending of the

tube by flexing of the material remaining at the bases of
the grooves and to hinder bending of the tube beyond the

predetermined radius of curvature by the flanks on either
side of the grooves coming into abutment with each other.
An optical fibre sheathing as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein the circumferential grooves (218) are helical.
An optical fibre sheathing as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein the circumferential grooves (18) are annular.
An optical fibre sheathing as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein the circumferential grooves (18, 218) are

formed by cutting the outer tube surface (12).
An optical fibre sheathing as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 3, wherein the circumferential grooves (18, 218)

are formed by local compression of the tube wall material
(12) around a helical path or annular paths.
