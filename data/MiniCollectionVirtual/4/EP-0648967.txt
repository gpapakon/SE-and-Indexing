<ABSTRACT>
Integral joint for connecting two pipes (3,5), in which 
from the annular edge of the female pipe (3) an internal 

flaring with decreasing cross-section extends, which 
gets engaged, with interference, with a corresponding 

external counter-flaring provided on the end portion 
of the male (5) pipe nearby the overhanging back 

shoulder of the latter, in order to create another 
tight, all-metal sealing (12-13) with interference, 

additionally to the other tight sealing (10-11) already 
existing at the front end of said end portion of the 

male pipe (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integral 
butt-joint to connect two pipes which, by realizing 
between both pipes two distinct metal tight seals with 
interference engagement activated by the same 
operation of screwing down of said pipes into each 
other, makes it possible a tight seal to be 
accomplished which is effective and reliable even 
under extremely harsh operating conditions, i.e., high 
differential pressures and temperatures. From the prior art, different types of integral 
joints, i.e., joints obtained by simply screwing down 
the pipes to be connected, and therefore with no use 
of auxiliary organs (sleeves) in order to achieve the 
mechanical continuity, and the tight seal between the 
same pipes. Furthermore, some known types use an all-metal 
mechanical tight seal with interference between the 
end of the male pipe and the corresponding seat 
provided inside the female tube, in which 
corresponding conical (tapered) surfaces are purposely 
provided in order to secure the tightness of the 
joint. Unfortunately, none of these solutions known from 
the prior art secures an effective tight seal 
behaviour when the operating conditions become 
extremely harsh with high differential pressures, 
temperatures and tensile/compressive stresses applied 
to the joint, such as are found in petroleum field, 
e.g., in well completion. The purpose of the present invention precisely is  
 
of obviating the above said drawbacks and therefore 
supplying an integral joint of two pipes capable of 
securing always the tightness of the joint under any 
operating conditions, and, thus, allows a safe and 
reliable transport of also corrosive liquids, to be 
accomplished. The above purpose is substantially achieved by 
realizing an all-metal interference tight seal at both 
ends of the screw-threads of both the male and the 
female pipe. In that way, in fact, the double tight seal, 
besides securing the tightness of the joint also under 
high, both internal and external, pressures, also 
performs the task of safeguarding the same tightness 
also in the case that either of both seals is damaged, 
which can happen during the screwing down step of both 
pipes to be connected to each other. Summing-up, the integral butt joint between the 
hollow end portion of a female pipe provided with an 
internal screw thread and the corresponding end hollow 
portion of a male pipe to be screwed down inside the 
end portion of the female pipe, and, for that purpose, 
provided with an external screw thread; an externally

Integral butt joint between the hollow end 
portion of a female pipe provided with an internal 

screw thread and the corresponding end hollow portion 
of a male pipe to be screwed down inside the end 

portion of the female pipe, and, for that purpose, 
provided with an external screw thread; an externally 

overhanging back shoulder which, when both pieces are 
fully screwed down into each other, cooperates with 

the annular edge of said end portion of the female 
pipe; as well as with a flaring with decreasing 

cross-section extending from the front end of said end 
portion of the male pipe, suitable for interfering 

with a corresponding internal counter-flaring provided 
inside said end portion of the female pipe in order to 

create an all-metal interference tight seal, 
characterized in that, according to the present 

invention, from the annular edge of said end portion 
of the female pipe an internal flaring with decreasing 

cross-section extends, which is suitable for 
interfering with a corresponding external 

counter-flaring provided on said end portion of the 
male pipe nearby said overhanging back 

shoulder of the latter, in order to create another 
tight, all-metal sealing with interference.
