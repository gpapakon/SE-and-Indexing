<ABSTRACT>
A DHA-containing food material includes a marine 
micro algae containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A 

method of manufacturing the DHA-containing food material 
has the steps of culturing the marine micro algae 

containing DHA, separating bodies of the algae, water-washing, 
disinfecting and drying the bodies of the algae. 

A DHA-containing food including the marine micro algae 
containing the DHA can be directly added to a food. A 

method of manufacturing the DHA-containing food material 
may include the steps of kneading the marine micro algae 

containing the DHA with a food material, and heating the 
kneaded material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a food material 
containing docosahexaenoic acid (C₂₁H₃₁CO₂H), and more 
particularly to a food material that does not smell 
offensively of fish oil or the like. Also, the present 
invention relates to a food using the foregoing food 
material. The docosahexaenoic acid is a highly-unsaturated 
fatty acid having, according to reports made recently, a 
variety of beneficial physiological functions, such as 
lowering cholesterol, preventing blood coagulation and 
improving learning capability. It has been known that the docosahexaenoic acid 
(hereinafter abbreviated to "DHA"), which is highly-unsaturated 
fatty acid reported to have a variety of 
beneficial physiological functions, is contained in fish 
oil. This fact has resulted in health foods, which use 
the fish oil as the raw material, being sold. However, 
health foods using the fish oil as the raw material 
encounter a difficulty in removing the smell of the fish. 
To alleviate this problem, the fish oil is usually formed 
into pills coated with gelatin or the like. However, 
under the foregoing circumstance, it is difficult to eat 
the food of the foregoing type when it is mixed with a  
 
usual food. Since DHA can be oxidized very easily, a food which 
is manufactured by simply adding DHA or fish oil 
containing DHA cannot be cooked with heat in air. Hence, 
there arises a necessity of adding an antioxidation 
agent, or of using a means for preventing the contact 
with air. Recently, a discovery of eye socket lipid textures 
of various fish containing highly-concentrated DHA and 
progress in technology of separating and refining the 
fatty acid found in the textures have enabled the DHA to 
be separated and refined. However, the necessity of 
using very expensive reagents to separate and refine the 
DHA increases the cost of the food. Moreover, there have 
been problems associated with a peculiar smell caused 
from the fish oil, an unstable supply of the raw 
material, and so forth. In order to overcome the foregoing problems, a 
method has been discovered which causes microorganisms or 
the like to selectively produce DHA. For example, 
Pratima Bajpai et al., in their research, have reported 
that Thraustochytrium aureum belonging to lower fungi, 
produces DHA (APPL. MICROBIOL. BIOTECHNOL., 35,706 
(1991)). However, because the aforementioned fungus is a 
photosynthetic fungus, it is necessary to use light to 
culture it, thus requiring a special and large-sized 
culturing apparatus. What is worse, other
