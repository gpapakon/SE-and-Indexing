<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a system for integrally joining, permitting the physical separation, with breaking of an electrical linkage, of two bodies electrically connected together, including two parts (2A, 2B), one (2A) of which is fixed to one of the said bodies and the other one (2B) of which is fixed to the other body, and a locking device (3). According to the invention:   - the first part (2A) includes a movable element (8); an elastic device (9); a first movable contrivance (12), making sure of contact with the second part (2B) by means of at least one connection pin (13), when the movable element (8) separates from the latter, and breaking the electrical linkage leading to the said first connection pin (13); and a first elastic means (15); - and the second part (2B) includes a second movable contrivance (18), remaining in contact with the first movable contrivance (12), upon separation of the said movable element (8); and a second elastic means (21).

Process for physical separation, with breaking of 
an electrical link, of two bodies (A, B) locked and 

connected together electrically by at least two cooperating 
connection pins arranged respectively on one and the 

other of the said bodies, according to which process the 
two bodies are unlocked and the said bodies are moved 

progressively apart from each other, characterized in 
that, when moving the said bodies progressively apart, 

the following steps are carried out: 

the electrical contact between the two bodies is 
momentarily maintained at the two connection pins; 
the electrical link leading to the corresponding 
connection pin is broken inside each of the said 

bodies; 
each of the said connection pins is earthed; and 
movement of the two bodies apart is continued until 
complete physical separation and breaking of the 

connection between the said two connection pins. 
System (1) for releasable joining of two bodies 
(A, B) allowing physical separation, with breaking of an 

electrical link, of the said bodies (A, B) which are 
electrically connected together, including, 


two body parts (2A, 2B), one (2A) of which is fixed 
to one (A) of the said bodies and the other (2B) of 

which is fixed to the other body (B); and 
a locking device (3) which keeps the said two body 
parts (2A, 2B) together and which releases them when 

it is triggered, 
  
 

characterized: 

in that the first body part (2A) includes: 

a mobile element (8) capable of moving relative 
to the said first body part (2A), while moving 

away from the second body part (2B); 
an elastic device (9) which moves the said mobile 
element (8); 
a first mobile equipment item (12) capable of 
moving relative to the said mobile element (8) so 

as to make contact with the second body part (2B) 
via at least a first connection pin (13), when 

the mobile element (8) moves away from the 
latter, and to break the electrical link leading 

to the said first connection pin (13); and 
a first elastic means (15) which moves the said 
first mobile equipment item (12); 
in that the second body part (2B) includes: 

a second mobile equipment item (18) capable of 
moving relative to the said second body part 

(2B), so as to remain in contact with the first 
mobile equipment item (12) via a second 
connection pin (19) connected to the said first 

connection pin (13), when the said mobile element 
(8) moves away, and to break the electrical link 

leading to the said second connection pin (19); 
and 
a second elastic means (21) which moves the said 
second mobile equipment item (18); and 
in that each of the said first and second connection 
pins (13, 19) is capable of being set, during movement 

of the corresponding mobile equipment item (12, 
18), in one of two different positions: 


a connection position, in which it is connected 
to an electrical link; and 
a disconnection position, in which it is earthed. 
System (1) according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the said elastic device (9) consists of springs (10, 

11). 
System (1) according to one of Claims 2 or 3,  
 

characterized in that the said first and second elastic 
means (15, 21) consist of springs (16, 17, 22, 23). 
System (1) according to one of Claims 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the said springs (10, 11, 16, 17, 

22, 23) are made of stainless steel. 
System (1) according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the electrical contacts are 

gold/gold contacts. 
System (1) according to one of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that the locking device (3) includes: 


a double jaw (35), associated with shoes (36, 37) 
which are connected together by a wire (38) and 

which are intended to keep the two body parts 
secured together; and 
a cutting member (39) capable of cutting the said 
wire (38). 
System (1) according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the cutting member is a double cutting member and in 

that it is triggered by two separate igniters.
