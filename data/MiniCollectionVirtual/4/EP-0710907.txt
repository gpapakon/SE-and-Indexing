<ABSTRACT>
A DSP co-processor (72) that is used on an integrated circuit
(24) that provides multiple communication functions is

accomplished by providing a data bus interface (320), a sequencer
(328), internal memory (33), and a data core (322). The sequencer

(328) stores in a hardware format a signal processing algorithm
(332) and, upon receipt of an operational command, provides

address control signals (334) and operation control signals (336) to
the data core (322). The data core (322), which includes an address

generation unit (340) and an arithmetic unit (344), executes, via
the arithmetic unit, operational instructions of the signal

processing algorithm to produce resultant signals from the input
samples, the intermediate resultants, and the algorithm co-efficients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuits 
and more particularly to a method and apparatus for performing a 
multitude of communication tasks on a single integrated circuit. Wireless communication devices, such as cellular telephones, 
mobile radio/telephones and portable radio/telephones, operate by 
sending a request for a wireless communication service to a 
communication resource controller. The request typically contains 
the requesting unit's individual identification code (ID), the type of 
service requested, and identity of a target unit, where the target 
unit may be a wireless communication unit or a wireline 
communication unit. The types of wireless services that may be 
requested include one-to-one communications (i.e., private calls), 
one-to-many communications (i.e., group or conference calls), data 
transmissions, and/or telephone interconnect calls (i.e., calling a 
wireline telephone user). For example, if the requesting unit 
desires to place a private call to another communication unit, the 
request would include the requesting unit's ID, the target unit's ID, 
and a private call request. Upon receiving the request, a communication resource 
controller determines whether the requesting communication unit 
is authorized to access a wireless communication system and the 
requested service. If authorized, the communication resource  
 
controller interprets the service requested and identity of the 
target unit. Depending on the service requested and identity of the 
target unit, the communication resource controller attempts to 
provide the requested service by establishing a communication path 
between the requesting unit and the target unit. For example, if the 
requested service indicates a private call between two wireless 
communication units that are within the coverage area of the 
communication resource controller, the controller can establish the 
private call by allocating a wireless communication resource to the 
wireless communication units. If, however, the requested service indicates a private call 
between a requesting unit in the wireless communication system 
and a target unit that is a wireline communication unit, the 
communication resource controller needs to establish a wireless 
path and a wireline path for the requested communication to occur. 
The communication resource controller establishes the wireless 
path as it would for a communication between two wireless 
communication units, but, to establish the wireline path, the 
communication
