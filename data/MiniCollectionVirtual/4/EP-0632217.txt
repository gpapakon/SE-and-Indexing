<ABSTRACT>
A transmission control in a multi-speed 
transmission gear arrangement (14) is responsive to 

thrust forces generated at the gear member 
(41,43,58,44) controlled by an on-coming friction 

device (36,38,40,42) during a ratio interchange to 
generate a control signal. The control signal is used 

to begin the disengagement process of the off-going 
friction device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transmission 
control or transmission gear arrangements, and more 
particularly, to transmission controls effective to 
initiate the disengagement of friction devices during 
a ratio interchange. In power transmission gear arrangements, a 
number of gear ratios are used to provide more 
efficient employment of a prime mover having a limited 
operating speed range. The ratios are interchanged by engaging one 
friction device, such as a clutch, and disengaging 
another friction device. During a portion of the 
interchange period, both friction devices are at least 
partially engaged. The off-going device is held fully 
engaged until the on-coming device has a predetermined 
torque capacity. The point at which the off-going device should 
begin to release is difficult to determine. Some prior 
art control systems have used the torque level at the 
output shaft as exemplified by stress therein. Still 
other systems use a time phased control which is 
adjusted by the harshness or softness of the previous 
shift for a given set of input parameters. The most 
popular method of controlling upshift timing appears to 
be the use of a one-way torque transmitting device, 
either alone or in series, with a friction device. 
WO-A-92/07206 discloses a system in accordance with the 
preamble of claim 1. WO-A-88/09450 discloses gear means 
selectively connectable with a shaft member supported in 
a bearing member. A power transmission and control in 
accordance with the present invention is characterised 
over WO-A-92/07206 by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of claim 1.  
 The present invention has a control member 
that senses a thrust load generated in a power path of 
the on-coming friction device to initiate the 
disengagement of the off-going friction device. With meshing helical gears, a thrust force 
is generated during the transmission of torque. The 
thrust force is transmitted via respective shafts or 
hubs to be absorbed by bearings mounted in the 
transmission housing. Preferably, by placing sensors 
or switches in operative relation with the bearings, 
the thrust level and therefore torque level of each 
gear mesh can be sensed for use as a control signal. If the torque path through the gear mesh is 
established by a selectively engageable friction 
device, such as a fluid operated torque transmitting 
device, the transmission of torque can be controlled 
during the ratio interchange. When the friction 
device is slippingly engaged, as the on-coming device 
is
