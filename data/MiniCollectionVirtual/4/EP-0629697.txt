<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to methods for the 
identification of therapeutic agents for the treatment of 

osteoporosis and serum lipid lowering agents. The 
invention relates to isolating cloning, and using nucleic 

acids from the promoter regions of transforming growth 
factor β genes comprising novel regulatory elements 

designated "raloxifene responsive elements". The 
invention also encompasses eukaryotic cells containing 

such raloxifene responsive elements operably linked to 
reporter genes such that the raloxifene responsive 

elements modulate the transcription of the reporter 
genes. The invention provides methods for identifying 

anti-osteoporosis agents that induce transcription of 
genes operably linked to such raloxifene responsive 

elements without inducing deleterious or undesirable side 
effects associated with current anti-osteoporosis 

therapy regimens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods for identifying 
therapeutic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. The 
invention relates to isolating, cloning, and using nucleic 
acids comprising the promoter regions of mammalian 
transforming growth factor β genes that are novel 
regulatory elements designated "raloxifene responsive 
elements". The invention also encompasses genetically 
engineered eukaryotic cells containing the recombinant 
expression constructs wherein the raloxifene responsive 
elements are operably linked to reporter genes. In such 
cells the raloxifene responsive elements are capable of 
modulating transcription of the reporter genes in response 
to treatment with certain compounds. The invention also 
relates to methods for identifying anti-osteoporosis agents 
that induce transcription of certain genes via raloxifene 
responsive elements and that specifically do not induce 
deleterious or undesirable side effects that have been 
associated with estrogen replacement therapy, such as 
increased risk with uterine and breast cancer. The nucleic 
acids, cells, and methods of the invention provide 
effective methods for screening putative sources of anti-osteoporosis 
agents, and identifying those that 
advantageously lack the undesirable side effects associated 
with current anti-osteoporosis agents. The invention also 
relates to a method for inducing bone formation, a method 
for treating osteoporosis, and a method for treating bone 
fractures which comprise administering a compound that, 
when bound to an estrogen receptor, potently induces 
transcription from a raloxifene responsive element. In 1991, U.S. pharmaceutical companies spent an 
estimated $7.9 billion on research and development devoted 
to identifying new therapeutic agents (Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturer's Association). The magnitude of this amount 
is due, in part, to the fact that the hundreds, if not 
thousands, of chemical compounds must be tested in order to  
 
identify a single effective therapeutic agent that does not 
engender unacceptable levels of undesirable or deleterious 
side effects. There is an increasing demand for economical 
methods of testing large numbers of testing large number of 
chemical compounds to quickly identify those compounds that 
are likely to be effective in treating disease. At 
present, few such economical systems exist. One disease that conspicuously lacks a rapid method 
for screening large numbers of potential therapeutic agents 
is bone loss. Bone loss occurs in a wide variety of 
patien
