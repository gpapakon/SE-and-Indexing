<ABSTRACT>
A liquid soap dispenser is disclosed having a 
permanent housing (14,114) which permits simplified insertion and 

replacement of disposable fluid reservoirs (12). The housing (14,114) 
includes and actuator assembly (30,130) which is cycled by a 

lever (32,132) 
between first and second positions. The actuator assembly 

is configured to couple to a valve assembly (22,122) 
on the reservoir (12) 

so that when cycled, the valve assembly (22,122) is actuated in 
sliding movement to dispense a quantity of fluid. The 

actuator assembly (30,130) includes a pair of resiliently deformable 
fingers (40,42,140,142) which act to secure the 

valve assembly (22,122) to the 
actuator assembly (30,130) for sliding movement therewith. If on 

insertion of a replacement reservoir (12), the reservoir is 
positioned uncoupled from the actuator assembly (30,130), on first 

cycling of the actuator assembly (30,130) 
the fingers (40,42,140,142) deform to 

permit movement of the actuator assembly (30,130) relative to valve 
assembly (22,122) and move towards a coupled orientation. In the 

coupled orientation, the fingers (40,42,140,142)  return to an undeformed 
configuration securing the valve assembly (22,122) to the actuator 

assembly (30,130).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fluid
dispensers, and more particularly to a liquid soap dispenser
which is adapted for simplified replacement of a liquid soap
reservoir.Many of todays products sold in liquid form, such
as liquid hand soap, are contained in disposable containers
or reservoirs which incorporate a pump assembly. Typically
the pump assembly includes a reciprocally movable element,
which when moved dispenses a quantity of liquid soap from
the reservoir. The reservoirs are fitted within a permanent
housing which includes a movable actuator assembly which
secures and reciprocally moves the movable element to
dispense the fluid. This has been found to be both a
convenient and economical means of fluid supply and
dispensation. As the fluid reservoirs are replaced once the
fluid supply is exhausted, it is desirable to manufacture
the dispenser and reservoir so as to make replacement of the
fluid reservoir as easy and quick as possible.Known fluid dispensers suffer the disadvantage in
that replacement of the fluid reservoir is time consuming,
as care must be taken to ensure the reservoir is placed in
the permanent housing in the correct dispensing position to
dispense fluids. If the reservoir is not placed in the
correct dispensing position with the movable element coupled
to the actuator assembly, the dispenser will be inoperative
as the movement of the actuator assembly will not
reciprocally move the movable element and no fluids will be
dispensed. To achieve the proper dispensing configuration,
the pump assembly must therefore be precisely aligned in the
housing to ensure it is properly secured in or coupled to 
the actuator assembly.Known fluid dispensers suffer the further
disadvantage, in that to secure or couple the pump assembly
to the actuator assembly of the housing, an adjustment of
the position of the reciprocally movable element is often
required. In adjusting the movable element, liquid from the
reservoir may be inadvertently dispensed or escape to adhere
to and solidify around the permanent housing. These
hardened liquids are often difficult to remove, affecting
the smooth operation of the dispenser and creating an
unfavourable and aesthetically unpleasing appearance.U.S. Patent 5,165,577 issued November 24, 1992 to
the inventor of this application and teaches a dispenser
with a housing and removable reservoir carrying a pump with
a reciprocally movable pistol; such a dispenser presents the
features of the preamble of claim 1. A lever journalled to the
housing carries a hook to
