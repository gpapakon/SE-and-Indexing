<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a Continuation-in-Part of 
United States Patent Application Serial No. 533,245 
filed June 4, 1990 which in turn is a continuation-in-part 
of United States Patent Application Serial No. 
406,945 filed September 13, 1989. This invention relates to certain 
monocyclopentadienyl metal compounds of a Group IV B 
transition metal of the Periodic Table of Elements, to 
a catalyst system comprising a monocyclopentadienyl 
Group IV B transition metal compound and an alumoxane, 
and to a process using such catalyst system for the 
production of polyolefins, particularly polyethylene, 
polypropylene and α-olefin copolymers of ethylene and 
propylene having a high molecular weight. The 
catalyst system is highly active at low ratios of 
aluminum to the Group IV B transition metal, hence 
catalyzes the production of a polyolefin product 
containing low levels of catalyst metal residue. 
Titanium species of the catalyst are stable at high 
pressures in unsupported form, unlike their bis-cyclopentadienyl 
titanium compound counterparts, and 
exhibit the ability to catalyze the incorporation of 
higher α-olein comonomer contents for production of 
higher molecular weight α-olefin copolymers than 
analogous zirconium and hafnium species of a 
monocyclopentadienyl transition metal compound. As is well known, various processes and catalysts 
exist for the homopolymerization or copolymerization 
of olefins. For many applications it is of primary 
importance for a polyolefin to have a high weight 
average molecular weight while having a relatively 
narrow molecular weight distribution. A high weight 
average molecular weight, when accompanied by a narrow  
 
molecular weight distribution, provides a polyolefin 
or an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer with high strength 
properties. Traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts system -- a 
transition metal compound cocatalyzed by an aluminum 
alkyl -- are capable of producing polyolefins having 
a high molecular weight but a broad molecular weight 
distribution. More recently a catalyst system has been 
developed wherein the transition metal compound has 
two or more cyclopentadienyl ring ligands -- such 
transition metal compound being referred to as a 
metallocene -- which catalyzes the production of 
olefin monomers to polyolefins. Accordingly, 
metallocene compounds of a Group IV B metal, 
particularly, titanocenes and zirconocenes, have been 
utilized as the transition metal component in such 
"metallocene" containing catalyst system for the 
production of
