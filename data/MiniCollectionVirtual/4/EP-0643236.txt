<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic armature assembly (20) includes a 
spider (25) made of resiliently yieldable plastic and 

carrying an annular armature plate (29). A mounting disc 
(35) is insert molded into the spider (25) and is adapted 

to be assembled with a tubular hub (36) mountable on a 
rotatable shaft (12). The mounting disc (35) enables the 

armature assembly (20) to be mounted on various types of 
hubs, either with no change to the armature assembly (20) 

or with very little change.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an electromagnetic 
coupling such as a clutch or brake and, more 
particularly, to an armature assembly for such a 
coupling. Booth et al United States Patent No. 5,036,964 and 
Booth United States Patent No. 5,150,779 each disclose an 
electromagnetic clutch in which an armature is connected 
to a driven hub on a rotatable shaft and is adapted to be 
frictionally coupled to a driving rotor when an electromagnet 
is energized to engage the clutch. When the 
clutch is engaged, the rotor acts through the armature to 
rotate the driven hub and the shaft. The armature assembly disclosed in each of the 
aforementioned patents includes a resilient plastic 
spider with a web which acts to connect a low magnetic 
reluctance armature plate for rotation with the driven 
hub. The web flexes axially in order to permit the armature 
plate to move toward and away from the rotor when 
the clutch is engaged and disengaged. The hub is insert 
molded in place when the spider is molded and thus the 
plastic of the spider is bonded to and encapsulates part 
of the hub in order to join the hub to the spider. Clutches are used with different types of shafts 
which require different types of armature hubs. As a 
result, it has been necessary in the past to customize 
various armature assemblies having different types of 
hubs molded in place in the spider. A substantial tooling 
investment is required to achieve this and, in addition, 
several different types of customized armature 
assemblies must be maintained in inventory. The general aim of the present invention is to provide 
a new and improved armature assembly of the foregoing  
 
general character which is more universally adaptable 
to different types of hubs and shafts so as to 
reduce the cost of both producing and inventorying armature 
assemblies. A more detailed object of the invention is to 
achieve the foregoing by standardizing the resiliently 
yieldable spider of the armature assembly and by insert 
molding a relatively simple mounting disc in the spider, 
the mounting disc being adapted for assembly with a 
separately formed hub. The external configuration of 
mounting discs for various types of hubs is identical and 
thus substantially common tooling may be used to effect 
insert molding of the mounting discs. These and other objects and advantages of the invention 
will become more apparent from the following 
detailed description when taken in conjunction with the 
accompanying drawings. FIGURE 1 is a side elevational

<CLAIMS>
An armature assembly (20) for use with an electromagnetic 
coupling (10) having a rotatable shaft (12), said armature 

assembly comprising a generally circular spider (25) having a 
web (26) made of resiliently yieldable plastic and having a 

centrally located hole (31) extending axially therethrough, an 
annular armature plate (29) of low magnetic reluctance 

material secured to the outer peripheral portion of said 
web, a mounting disc (35) located in said hole and joined 

intimately to said spider, said disc having a centrally 
located hole (40) extending axially therethrough, a tubular 

hub (36) formed separately of said disc and inserted through 
said hole in said disc, said hub being sized and shaped 

to telescope over said shaft, first means for preventing 
said disc from moving relative to said hub, and second 

means for preventing said hub from moving relative to 
said shaft (46). 
An armature assembly (20) as defined in claim 1 in 
which said first means comprise an internal thread in the 

hole (40) of said disc (35) and further comprise an external thread 
on said hub (36) and threadably engaged with said internal 

thread. 
An armature assembly (20') as defined in claim 1 in 
which said first means are defined in part by the edge of 

said hole (40') in said disc (35'), said edge being non-circular in 
shape, said first means also being defined in part by a 

non-circular peripheral surface of said hub (36') and engageable 
with said edge to prevent rotation of said disc on 

said hub. 
An armature assembly (20") as defined in claim 1 in 
which said first means are defined at least in part by 

weld means (60) between said disc (35") and said hub (36").  
 
An armature assembly (20) as defined in claim 1 in 
which said second means comprise a key (46) located between 

said hub (36) and said shaft (12) and preventing said hub from 
rotating on said shaft. 
An armature assembly (20) as defined in claim 5 in 
which said second means further comprise a screw (50) adapted 

to be threaded axially into the end of said shaft (12) and 
having means (53) for captivating said hub (36) axially on said 

shaft. 
An armature assembly (20) as defined in claim 1 
said 

web having inner and outer peripheral portions, a 
sleeve (30) integral with the inner peripheral portion of said 

web, said centrally located hole (31) formed through 
said sleeve, said mounting disc (35) having an outer peripheral 

portion defined by a series of angularly spaced lugs (38) and 
intervening spaces, 

with the outer peripheral portion of said disc being 
disposed in said sleeve and with said spaces being filled 

with said plastic material, said plastic material being 
bonded intimately to said lugs.
