<ABSTRACT>
An exhaust gas purification filter comprising a 

metal porous body obtained by packing and fixing metal 
fibers having a mean fiber diameter of 5 to 40 µm or 

heat resistant ceramic fibers having a mean fiber 
diameter of 1 to 40 µm in a dispersed state into pores 

of a foamed structure porous body made of a heat-resistant 
metal so that a packing density of the 

resulting metal porous body is from 5 to 20%. The 
filter may be in a laminated structure by laminating 

the foregoing foamed structure porous body filled with 
or without the metal or ceramic fibers and a fiber 

structure porous body obtained by fixing metal fibers 
having a mean diameter of 5 to 40 µm or heat-resistant 

ceramic fibers having a mean diameter of 1 to 40 µm in 
a dispersed state so that a packing density is from 5 

to 25% are laminated. By using the inventive filter 
for collecting PM (dry soot, fine particles and SOF) 

contained in an exhaust gas of a Diesel engine, a 
pressure loss for the exhaust gas is minimized while 

high collection efficiency is kept.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter for
collecting dry soot, fine particles and SOF (Soluble
Organic Fraction), etc. contained in an exhaust gas
of a Diesel engine. Hereinafter, "particulate matter"
is referred to as "PM" for abbreviation.Exhaust gases of automobiles are one of the
major causes for air pollution, and technology for
removing noxious components contained in the exhaust
gases is extremely important. Particularly, in Diesel
engine vehicles, removal of PM containing carbon fine
particles as a principal component is very important.
To remove these noxious components, engine improving
attempts have been made by applying EGR (Exhaust Gas
Recirculation) and improving a fuel injection system
and the shape of a combustion chamber. Nonetheless, a
drastic measure has not yet been established.
Therefore, a method which disposes an exhaust trap in
an exhaust passage, collects PM by the trap and
removes them by after-treatment, has been proposed
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 51235/ 1983). This
after-treatment method has been believed most
practical to this date, and further studies have been
continued.The particulate trap for collecting the PM must
satisfy the following performance as required by the 
conditions of use of the trap.First, the particulate trap must have PM
collection efficiency to satisfy a required purity of
the exhaust gas. The PM emission quantity varies with
an exhaust quantity and a load of the Diesel engine,
but it is believed that the trap must collect at least
60% of the mean PM emission quantity (at least 85% of
dry soot collection efficiency) from the Diesel
engine.Second, a pressure loss to the exhaust gas must
be small. As more PM is collected, the pressure loss
at the time when the engine exhaust gas passes through
the trap becomes greater, so that a back pressure acts
on the engine and exerts adverse influences on the
engine. It is generally believed that the pressure
loss after collection must be limited to not higher
than 3 kPa. To satisfy this requirement, the filter
element must be periodically cleaned to remove the PM
whenever a predetermined quantity of the PM is
collected, so as to regenerate the filter element and
to return it to the initial pressure loss state. When
the ratio of the rise of the pressure loss to the PM
collection quantity is great, this
regeneration/removal operation becomes more frequent
and is not practical. Accordingly, the particulate
trap must not only have a small initial pressure loss
but must also prevent easy rise of the pressure loss
even
