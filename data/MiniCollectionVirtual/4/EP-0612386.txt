Stop slide valve, comprising a housing (1) provided with a 
throughflow channel and two sealing seats (3, 4) secured to the housing (1) 

and spaced apart in the direction of flow, whereas a stop plate (5) can be 
slid between said sealing seats (3, 4), said stop plate (5) being composed of 

two plate components (5a, 5b) mutually spaced apart and guided in the 
direction of flow, which can be lifted off from or pressed against the sealing 

seats (3, 4) by means of lifting and pressing elements, 

characterized in
 
that lift springs (16) whose elastic force acts upon both plate components 

(5a, 5b) so as to lift them are arranged between the plate components 
(5a, 5b) and that individually actuated pressing elements (17, 18) fixed to 

the housing (1) are associated with each plate component (5a, 5b) and act 
upon the respective plate components (5a, 5b) to press them down. 
Stop slide valve according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
stop plate (5) is disposed in a slideable goggle valve carriage (6), which next 

to the closed stop plate (5) is provided with an open frame (8) with a 
through-pass-opening (7) composed of two frame components (8a,8b) 

mutually spaced apart in the direction of flow and coupled by a compensator 

(9), whereas lift springs (16) whose elastic force acts upon both frame 
components (8a, 8b) so as to lift them are arranged between the frame 

components (8a, 8b) and both frame components (8a, 8b) are actuated by  
 

the same pressing elements (17, 18) secured to the housing (1) to press 
them down as the plate components (5a, 5b) of the stop plate (5). 
Stop slide valve according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the pressing elements (17,18) each have actuating plungers (19, 20), 

which are extendable in the pressing direction of each plate component (5a, 
5b) and frame component (8a, 8b) respectively and which actuate bearing 

brackets (14, 15), which are attached circumferentially to each plate 
component (5a, 5b) and frame component (8a, 8b) respectively. 
Stop slide valve according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
opposing bearing brackets (14, 15) of the two plate components (5a, 5b) 

and frame components (8a, 8b) respectively are guided along one another 
for a limited sliding way in the direction of flow. 
Stop slide valve according to claim 4, characterized in that each 
of the lift springs (16) is positioned between two bearing brackets (14, 15) 

guided along one another. 
Stop slide valve according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
actuating plungers (19, 20) of two opposing pressing elements (17, 18) and 

the respective lift springs (16) between two bearing brackets (14,15) 
guided along one another are located on a common axis. 
Stop slide valve according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the actuating plungers (19,20) of the pressing 

elements (17, 18) are pressed down by actuate springs (21, 22), whose 
elastic force is larger than the elastic force of the lift springs (16), and are 

lifted by actuators (23, 24). 
Stop slide valve according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
actuators (23, 24) are pressure driven master cylinders.  

 
Stop slide valve according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
pressure rooms of the actuators (23, 24) of all pressing elements (17, 18) 

are connected with one another by means of pressure pipes (25) fixed to the 
housing (1). 
Stop slide valve according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
actuators (23, 24) are jackscrew drivers.
