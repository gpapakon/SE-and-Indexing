<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method which can be used not only for removing noise, for example in automatic speech recognition, but also for improving the speech quality for humans, for example hands-free speech on the car phone. The noise reduction is carried out in a two-channel or multiple-channel manner, in such a way that the temporal and spatial-acoustic signal properties of speech and noise are used systematically in a stepwise fashion.

<CLAIMS>
Method of noise reduction of at least two disturbed speech channels, wherein the
disturbed speed channels are led together into one output channel, characterised thereby


that by means of digital directional filters (H
R1
, H
R2
) and a linear phase estimation
for the individual channels a swingable acoustic directional lobe is produced

(H
ALLP
), which follows the speaker movement and thereby the spatial disturbance
sources are attenuated,
that the disturbance is estimated in the individual speech pauses and the
disturbance sources which are stationary in terms of time are attenuated by

spectral subtraction (H
SPS1
, H
SPS2
),
that subsequently the individual speech channels are added and thereby the
statistical disturbances of the spectral subtraction are averaged, and
that the sum signal is reprocessed by a modified coherence function and thereby
the diffuse disturbance and Hall components are attenuated.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby

that the spectral subtraction is carried out with two adaptive smoothing constants α,
β,
that the disturbance spectrum S
nn
 is estimated with the first adaptive smoothing
constant β, and
that the output density S
xx
 of the individual channels is smoothed strongly in the
speed pauses and lightly during speech with the second adaptive smoothing

constant α.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the linear phase
displacement of at least two signals is ascertained by way of a defined number of maxima

of the cross-power density in the frequency range.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the phase correction, the
directional filtering and a possibly necessary inverse filtering is carried out in the frequency

range.
