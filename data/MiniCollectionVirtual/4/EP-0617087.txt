<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film for high heat-sensitive stencil paper and, particularly, to a film for high
heat-sensitive stencil paper which has an excellent perforation sensitivity and an excellent printing quality, i.e., resolution
and density of a printed image.As a heat-sensitive stencil paper, a laminate composed of a film of a thermoplastic resin such as polyester
and thin porous paper has been known. The film used for this purpose is required to have the following properties.
(1) The film is required to have a high thermal perforation sensitivity. The film is required to melt with a small
quantity of heat and to have an adequate heat shrinkage which enables openings of an appropriate size for producing
a clear printed image to be formed.(2) The film is required to have high strength and elasticity enough to withstand operations of laminating with thin
porous paper and printing. In addition, even if the operation includes a heating step, the film is required not to
cause a problem such as curling of the stencil paper due to heating.(3) The film is required to have good gradation in thermal perforation. The gradation of a printed image is deteriorated
if a portion other than the portions to be perforated is melted due to the influence of the neighboring perforation.
The film is required to have good thermal perforation property which can discriminate between the portions
to be perforated and the portions not to be perforated.In addition to these requirements, the film is required to be excellent in the handling property at the time of
the production of the film and the formation of the stencil paper. For example, the stretching property is so good as not
to cause a trouble such as breakage during production of the film, and that the wind-up property and slittabiltiy are so
good as not to produce a crease on the film or as not to cause weaving. It is also necessary that no trouble is caused
at the film winding step or the film running step during the formation of stencil paper.As a film (biaxially oriented film formed from a thermoplastic resin) for heat-sensitive stencil paper, there have
been proposed a film improved in printing characteristics by defining the thermal properties (Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 62-149496 (1987)), a film defined by the surface roughness and the number of protuberances
on the film surface (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 63-227634 (1988)) and films defined
by the heat shrinkage properties (Japanese Patent Application

A process for producing a film for heat-sensitive stencil paper, which
film comprises a biaxially oriented film having a thickness of 0.5 to 3 µm

and formed from a polyester composition comprising polybutylene terephthalate
and another polyester,

   wherein the ratio of the polybutylene terephthalate in the whole polyester
is 30 to 70 wt%, the maximum value of average heat shrinkage stresses

in the machine and transverse directions of the film measured at a film
temperature of 60 to 140°C is more than 300 g/mm
2
, and the heat shrinkage
of the film by treatment at 100°C for 3 minutes is not less than 20 %,

   which process comprises:

melt-extruding the polyester composition from a slit die,
rapidly cooling to a temperature of not higher than the glass transition
temperature of the polyester composition,
first-stretching the obtained amorphous sheet in one direction at a
temperature of 20 to 100°C to 3.0 to 7 times,
second-stretching the first-stretched sheet in the direction perpendicular
to the direction of first-stretch at a temperature of 20 to 100°C to

3.0 to 7 times, and
subjecting the biaxially stretched film to substantially no heat-treatment
or heat-treating the biaxially stretched film at not higher than 110°C

for 1 second to 5 minutes under an elongation ofwithin 30 % or while holding
the film at a constant length.
The process according to claim 1, wherein the average value of the
heat shrinkage stress (Sm) (g/mm

direction perpendicular to the direction of scanning by the thermal head)

2
), and
the ratio (Sm/St) of said heat shrinkage stresses (Sm and St) measured at a

film temperature of 100°C is in the range of 1.2 to 5.

composition when the polyester composition is formed into the 

film, is in the range of 150 to 240°C.

contains (A) 0.005 to 0.3 wt% of particles which have an average particle

diameter (d
