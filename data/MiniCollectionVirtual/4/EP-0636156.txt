<DESCRIPTION>
Work in the field of dendritic molecules dates back to the 
early fifties with the publication of a theoretical paper by 
Flory, J.Am. Chem. Soc., 74, 2719 (1952). Basically, a dendritic 
molecule is a highly branched polymer molecule. The prior art reports various ways to prepare such dendritic 
molecules. For example, Vogtle and coworkers, Synthesis 155 
(1978) described a "cascade" approach. This approach is not 
capable of producing a dendritic molecule having a molecular 
weight of greater than 790 Daltons. More recently, Newkome used 
a nucleophilic displacement reaction on a multifunctional core 
to produce, after two stages of reaction, a cascade molecule 
coined "arboral" with molecular weights of up to 1600 Daltons. 
See, for example, Aharoni et al, Macromolecules 15, 1093 (1982); 
J. Org. Chem. 50, 2004 (1985); Newkome et al. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. 
Commum., 752 (1986); and Newkome et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108, 
849 (1986). The most extensive published studies of dendritic molecules are 
directed to "starburst" polymers. See, for example, U.S. Pat. 
Nos. 4,507,466; 4,558, 120; 4,568,737; 4,587,329; 4,737,550; and 
4,857,599. Such "starburst" polymers are made by a divergent 
approach building the molecule from the core towards its 
extremities. More recently, two co-inventors of this invention obtained a 
patent, U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,516, describing a novel convergent 
approach to produce dendritic molecules. In this approach, the 
molecule is built from the outside towards the core. This 
approach enables the accurate placement of one or more functional 
groups in the outer surface of the dendritic polymer. Once formed by whatever method, the dendritic polymers have  
 
many uses such as polymer crosslinking agents, drug delivery 
systems, optoelectronic carriers for synthetic enzymes and 
genetic materials, etc. In U.S. Patent 5,041,516, at columns 5 
and 6, lines 60-13 uses for dendritic polymers which include the 
formation of macromolecules having identifiable shapes such as 
"barbells", "knots", etc. is disclosed. The disclosure is, 
however, very limited as to how to make such structures. For 
example, with respect to barbells, the only disclosure of how to 
produce such a shape is limited to a "barbell" shape produced 
from 2 dendritic molecules having surface functional groups at 
which point they are joined together by a connecting linkage. 
This procedure is disclosed at col. 6, lines 12-13, and Example 
VI. The only other specific disclosure relates to a "knot" 
structure formed by
