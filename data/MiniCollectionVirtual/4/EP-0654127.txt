<ABSTRACT>
A clutch in a vehicle transmission is provided with an accumulator (13) which contains oil when the clutch transmits drive torque during normal operation. At the time of a clutch disengagement movement, the accumulator (13) is evacuated and the oil is transferred to the clutch housing (2), which is therefore filled with oil during clutch operation. After clutch operation, the oil returns to the accumulator (13), while the clutch housing (2) is evacuated of oil. This means that the clutch acts as a wet clutch during clutch operation and as a dry clutch during other operating conditions. The advantages of the respective types of clutch can be utilised without suffering their respective disadvantages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an arrangement for a clutch according to the preamble to the 
accompanying claim 1. Clutches between a vehicle's engine and its gearbox usually take the form of friction clutches. 
These include as one half of the clutch one or more discs which are connected to the vehicle's 
gearbox and which cooperate with the other half of the clutch, which usually takes the form 
of the engine flywheel and a pressure plate attached thereto and possibly further discs 
fastened thereto. Clutch operation is by means of a disengaging mechanism which includes a clutch pedal 
operable by the driver. During clutch operation a difference in speed occurs between the 
parts of the clutch, resulting in their sliding with respect to one another and generating 
friction heat. Particularly in clutches which transmit high torque, e.g. clutches in heavy duty 
vehicles such as trucks and buses, this friction heat may be considerable. With a view both to 
preventing the occurrence of locally high disc temperature rises and to facilitating the 
removal of such heat, it is known for the clutch to take the form of a wet clutch. In a wet 
clutch the clutch parts and discs are more or less immersed in oil. One problem with wet clutches is that the rotation of the clutch halves in the oil involves 
clutch slip losses which reduce driveline efficiency. A further disadvantage of the slip losses 
is that they contribute to rising oil temperature, thereby reducing the temperature range which 
can be used for further temperature rise in connection with clutch movements. Document US-A-4 753 332 discloses an arrangement for a clutch in a vehicle, wherein a 
clutch housing is connected to an accumulator. During clutch operation the clutch housing is 
filled with oil from the accumulator, and after clutch operation oil is evacuated from the 
clutch housing to a separate oil sump. After clutch operation the accumulator will be filled 
with oil from the oil sump with the aid of a spring acted piston. The object of the invention is to eliminate or at least reduce the aforesaid disadvantages of 
known wet clutches. The invention is therefore intended to reduce clutch slip losses due to 
the clutch rotating in oil and to reduce the oil temperature rise caused by slip losses.  
  
 The invention has the further object of providing an otherwise optimum clutch design with 
good facilities for removing friction heat from the discs and creating advantageous operating 
conditions. The arrangement is also intended to be easy to

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for a clutch in a vehicle transmission whereby the clutch (1) is 
accommodated in a clutch housing (2) which contains an oil sump (12) which itself at least 

partly accommodates the clutch (1), and wherin the oil sump (12) is connected to an 
accumulator (13) which takes the form of a cylinder (16) accommodating a movable piston 

(17) which delineates in the cylinder (16) a space (18) which can assume an oil-filled state in 
which the accumulator (13) contains oil, and which can assume an evacuated state in which 

the oil previously contained has been fed to the oil sump (12), and in that a device (48) for 
detecting clutch operation is connected to devices (25, 30, 47) which are directly or indirectly 

organised to make the accumulator (13) assume its evacuated state during clutch operation 
and its oil-filled state after clutch operation
characterised
 in that
 
the space (18) in the accumulator (13) directly communicates via a hydraulic line (22) with 

the clutch housing oil sump (12) through which line (22) oil in the clutch housing (2) can be 
directly evacuated into the accumulator (13) after clutch operation and through which line 

(22) oil can be directly transferred to the clutch housing (2) during clutch operation, 
and in that the piston (17) of the accumulator (13) is connected to a pressure medium 

controlled cylinder (25) which can act upon the piston (17) of the accumulator to make it 
assume its end position corresponding to the respective state of the accumulator (13). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the devices for directly or 
indirectly making the accumulator (13) assume its respective states include a control unit 

(47), that the device for detecting clutch operation takes the form of a sensor (48) which is 
connected to the control unit (47), and
 
that the pressure medium controlled cylinder (25) is connected to a pressure medium source 

(31) via a solenoid valve (30) which is controlled by the control unit (47). 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 in that the supply of pressure 
medium to the pressure medium controlled cylinder (25) takes place via a pipe (39), which 

contains a constriction (41), when the accumulator (13) is to be brought to its oil-filled state.  
 
Arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterised
 in that removal of pressure 
medium from the pressure medium controlled cylinder (25) takes place via a pipe (40), which 

contains a check valve (42), when the accumulator (13) is to be brought to its evacuated state, 
and that the pipe (40) containing the check valve (42), and the pipe (39) containing the 

constriction (41), are disposed mutually parallel in a pipe (38) between the solenoid valve 
(30) and the pressure medium controlled cylinder (25). 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1-4, 
characterised
 in that the pressure 
medium controlled cylinder takes the form of a compressed air cylinder (25) and that the 

pressure medium takes the form of compressed air.
