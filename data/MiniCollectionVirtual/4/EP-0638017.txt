<ABSTRACT>
In a process for recycling blown plastics, the plastic is first ground, melted, degassed and filtered. The degassed plastic is re-blown in the same plant before it has solidifed, and, in order to make the degree of blowing uniform, the quantity of gas introduced into the plastic is controlled in relation to the quantity of plastic taken to the blowing plant per unit time and the pressure of the plastic taken to the blowing plant is preferably kept as constant as possible. The device for implementing said process has an extruder (12, 13) to plasticise and degas the plastic, the outlet (15) of which is connected via at least one line (16) to a mixer (25) to which a gas supply device (29) is also connected. In the line (16) there is a melt pump (23) for the plastic, the flow rate of which is used as a guiding factor for the gas supply which is provided via a device (29) which is controlled by a control device (22) in proportion to the running speed of the melt pump (23).

Process for recycling foamed plastics 
material, for example polystyrene foam, in a plant in 

which the plastics material is melted open, filtered, 
defoamed, granulated and refoamed by mixing with 

driving gas, the refoaming taking place in the same 
plant as the granulation, 
characterised in that
 the 
refoaming is carried out on the plastics material 

subjected to defoaming and before granulation, in the 
plastic state of the plastics material, which plastic 

state is still caused by the melting process and the 
defoaming, and in that, at the same time, for the 

purpose of averaging the degree of foaming, the volume 
of driving gas inserted into the plastics material per 

unit of time and the mixing volume processed per unit 
of time during mixing are regulated in proportion to 

the volume of plastics material supplied to the foaming 
per unit of time. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the volume of plastics material supplied to the 
foaming per unit of time is maintained within a pre-determined 

range that is preferably close to the 
maximum capacity of the plant in use. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that
 the plastics material used is 
crushed and then plasticised and defoamed by means of a 

worm so that only the defoamed melt thus obtained is 
conveyed by means of a melt pump, preferably a gear 

pump, to a mixer which is also supplied with the 
driving gas used, wherein the quantity of plastics 

conveyed by the melt pump per unit of time is monitored 
and used as a reference variable for the driving gas 

supply, and in that the pressure of the plastics 
material on the suction side of the melt pump is 

monitored and maintained within a pre-determined range, 
preferably at a value that is as constant as possible,  

 
by altering the operation of the melt pump and/or the 

operation of the worm. 
Process according to claim 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the driving gas is already added to the stream of 
plastics material before its introduction into the 

mixer. 
Process according to claim 3 or 4, 

characterised in that
, when the pressure of the 
plastics melt conveyed by the melt pump deviates from a 

pre-selected setpoint, the viscosity of the mixture 
processed by the mixer is altered in a corresponding 

manner by cooling and/or heating, preferably until that 
setpoint is reached. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 the vacuum is monitored during 
the defoaming of the plastics material. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 liquid pentane is used as driving 
gas. 
Device for carrying out the process according 
to one of claims 1 to 7, having a crushing device (2) 

for crushing the plastics material for processing, to 
which crushing device there is attached at least a worm 

(13) driven by a motor (14) for the plasticization of 
this material, with which worm there is associated a 

defoaming device (17) for the plastics material, 

characterised in that
 the outlet (15) of these worms 
(13) only is connected by means of at least a pipeline 

(16) to a mixer (25) to which there is also attached a 
device (29) for the driving gas supply, and in that a 

device (43) for determining the quantity of plastics 
flowing into this pipeline (16) per unit of time is 

attached to at least one of these pipelines (16), which 
device (43) is connected to a control unit (22) for the 

driving gas supply to the mixer (25) and for the 
rotational speed of the motor (14) of the worm (13).  

 
Device according to claim 8, 
characterised in 
that
