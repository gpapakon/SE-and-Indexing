<ABSTRACT>
A radio link attenuator consists of a panel of an absorbent material fitted detachably to the outside of a cordless adapter terminal housing between the antenna and base station. The panel is set in a frame with a bracket for connecting to the housing, and has a plastic covering to protect it from the weather. The attenuator (AT), designed for use when a radio link is in operation between a base station and a cordless adapter terminal (CTA) with an integral antenna consists of a panel (P) of an absorbent material fitted detachably to the outside of the CTA housing between the antenna and base station. The panel is set in a frame (C) with a bracket (PE) for connecting to the housing, and it has a plastic covering to protect it from the weather.
