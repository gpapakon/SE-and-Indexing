<CLAIMS>
A shuttering system for concrete parts comprising a steel base plate (1), comprising 
magnetic members (6) which can be placed on the base plate, comprising shuttering 

components (3) and/or attachment components (12) which can be fixed in their particular 
position by the magnetic members, and comprising a tool (13) with a receiver to lift off the 

magnetic members, wherein the magnetic members (6) are U-shaped in cross-section and 
can be laid with their two limbs (7,8) on the base plate (1) then held there by their 

magnetic force,
 
characterised in that
 
the distance between the external surfaces of the two limbs (7,8) of the magnetic members 

(6) decreases towards the base plate (1), and that the shuttering components (3) and/or the 
attachment components (12) and possibly the tool (13) with its receiver match the external 

shape of the magnetic member (6). 
A shuttering system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the two limbs (7,8) of the magnetic members (6) have surfaces (11) on their external 

surfaces (9,10) which dimensionally match the width of the opening in the shuttering 
components (3) and/or attachment components (12) and possibly in the tool (13). 
A shuttering system according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
U-shaped shuttering components (3) are placed on the magnetic members (6), and means 

are provided to prevent the limbs (4,5) of the shuttering components (3) from being lifted 
off the base plate (1) accidentally. 
A shuttering system according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that 


small projections (15) acting as pressure points are provided in the lower region on the 
limbs (4,5) of the shuttering components (3), the projections protruding from the inside of 

the limbs 
and lying against the magnetic member (6).
