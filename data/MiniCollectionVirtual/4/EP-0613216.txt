<ABSTRACT>
A circular sensor connector (2) has terminals (18) to 
make contact between an internal printed circuit board 

(22) and conducting wires (54). In order to obtain a cost 
effective and compact configuration, the plurality of 

identical terminals (18) are disposed in a radial manner 
around the printed circuit board (22) whereby contact arms 

(36) having an arcuate contact profile (40), project 
towards the printed circuit board (22) and make contact 

therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circular catalytic
converter sensor connector for connection between an
internal printed circuit board and terminals in a compact
configuration.Catalytic converter sensors, commonly called lambda
probes, are usually attached to the housing of a catalyzer
and project a sensor through a hole in the housing to
measure various parameters of the exhaust gases. This hole
in the catalyzer structure not only affects the mechanical
integrity thereof but also produces a risk of gas leakage
through the sensor hole. For correct functioning of the
catalyzer, this gas leakage should be avoided. The size of
the probe hole must therefore be kept to a minimum, as a
small hole is easier to seal and has little effect on the
mechanical integrity of the catalyzer housing.Although reference above is made to measurement of
exhaust gases in a catalyzer, the above remarks are often
true in many other technical domains, that is to say,
where one is measuring parameters of a liquid or gas
within a container.The probe usually comprises a printed circuit board
which is partially exposed in the exhaust gas part of the
catalyzer and partially within a connector attached to the
catalyzer housing, whereby terminals in the connector make
electrical contact between the circuit traces on the
printed circuit board to external conducting wires. The
printed circuit board serves to electronically process the
measurement signals of the probe, and due to the high
temperatures, the board is made from a material such
as ceramic that can withstand high temperature. The boards
are made by pre-cutting out of a large ceramic board the
individual boards with a laser, the boards then broken off
along the laser trace lines. One of the problems associated 
to this procedure is that the ceramic boards have sharp
edges that would damage electrical contacts of a connector
when inserted between the contacts.In the prior art the plurality of terminals, for
example eight terminals, are disposed in two rows, one on
either side of the printed circuit board. The terminals,
however, require far more width than the spacing of circuit
traces on the printed circuit board because of the
practicable manufacturable size and strength of the
terminals that is desired. The diameter of the sensor
connector must therefore be large enough to accommodate the
rows of terminals and the walls separating the terminals.
It is desirable to make the sensor connector circular
because the circular hole in the catalyzer structure that
mates therewith, can be
