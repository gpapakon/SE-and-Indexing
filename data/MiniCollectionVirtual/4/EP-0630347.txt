Loading platform of apparatus for the manual and automatically controlled loading 
and unloading from the rear of HGVs, trailers and containers with pallets by means of 

a four- or six-pronged loading unit operating according to the fork-lift principle, which 
loading unit transfers the pallets from a collecting platform out of a warehouse or 

vehicle or container, the loading platform being movable up and down in a movable 
frame connected to the ramp or connected to a ramp and parallel to the loading edge 

of a warehouse or HGV docking point, characterised in that the link between the 
loading platform and the HGV loading surface can be formed by rails (2.2.1.2.), which 

are capable of extending from the loading platform, in which case pallets can be 
conveyed on the rails (2.2.1.2.) by means of longitudinal prongs (2.2.1.4.). 
Loading platform according to claim 1, characterised in that the rails (2.2.1.2.) are 
equipped on their under-side with sensors for checking that the HGV loading surface 

is in the correct position. 
Loading platform according to claim 1, characterised in that the rails (2.2.1.2.) are 
equipped with braces (2.2.1.3.) on either side of the HGV wall and between 

themselves. 
Loading platform according to claim 1, characterised in that it is provided with 
means (holding-down devices 2.4.2.) for lowering the loading edge of the HGV 

loading surface in the loaded state. 
Loading platform according to claim 1, characterised in that means (holding-down 
devices 2.4.2.) for lowering the loading edge of the HGV loading surface are part of a 

HGV docking point. 
Loading platform according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
longitudinal prongs (2.2.1.4.) are equipped with mechanically controllable means 

which make the longitudinal prongs laterally displaceable relative to the rails (2.2.1.2.), 
so that a respective spacing plate (2.2.1.5.) is slidable between the sides of the pallets  

 
associated with the HGV wall and the HGV wall itself. 
Loading platform according to claim 1, characterised in that pallets (transverse 
pallets) displaced through 90Â° can be raised until the rails (2.2.1.2.) and the 

longitudinal prongs (2.2.1.4.) have been inserted into the HGV loading surface.
