<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of repairing aerofoils (6), damaged in the head or edge area, of turbine engines. To this end, first of all damaged areas, except for an undamaged aerofoil stub, are cut off essentially transversely to the longitudinal extent of the aerofoil or at an angle to the front or rear edge of the aerofoil or roughly in a semicircular shape around the damaged aerofoil area to form a straight or roughly semicircular repair surface (31). The repair surface of the aerofoil stub is then prepared for butt welding. After that, a repair plate (7) of constant thickness, exceeding the maximum profile height of the aerofoil by more than 50%, is tack welded in an abutting position to the repair surface (31) with an end face (30) adapted to the repair surface, and the aerofoil stub and the repair plate (7) are welded by means of butt welding. Finally, the welding seam and the repair plate (7) are removed down to the profile contour of the aerofoil stub and to the desired aerofoil profile. This method is preferably used for the repair of aerofoils of integral rotors of turbine engines, in particular for aerofoils of integral compressor rotors.

A repair method for turbo engine blades damaged in the head or the edge area,
with the following steps:


a) Separating-off the damaged areas down to an undamaged blade-stump
substantially crosswise to the longitudinal projection of the blade, or at an angle

to the front or rear edge of the blade, or approximately in a semi-circle around
the damaged bl
ade area to form a straight or approximately semi-circular
repairing surface,
b) Preparing the repairing surface of the blade-stump for a butt welding, wherein
c) a repair plate (7) of a constant thickness, exceeding the maximum profile height
(h) of the blade by more than 50%, with a front side (30) is aligned to the repair

face (8), and attached flush to the repair face,
d) after this, the blade-stump (6) and the repair plate (7) are welded by butt-welding,
and
e) finally, the welding joint and the repair plate (7) are finished to the profile contour
of the blade-stump (6) and to the required blade profile.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that by local offsetting of the
energy source relative to the weld impact when butt-welding, more than 5/9 of

the energy supply is directed onto the repair plate (7).
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a repair plate (7)
having a thickness of at least twice the maximum profile thickness of the blade-stump

(6) is attached to the blade-stump (6). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a repair
plate (7) of a curved or pre-pressed or pre-formed curvature and constant

thickness (d) is attached.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a repair
plate (7) is attached with areas chamfered towards the blade edges (3, 4).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that for butt
welding, a tungsten-plasma-arc-welding (WPL) is carried out using the taphole

method.
A method according to claim 6, characterised in that during tungsten-plasma-arc-welding,
an offsetting of 55 to 100% in relation to the weld impact is maintained,

so that between 55 and 100% of the face of the arc base is directed onto the
repair plate (7) and the rest onto the blade-stump (6).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that for butt
welding, laser-beam or electron-beam welding is carried out.
A method according to claim 8, characterised in that when laser-beam or
electron-beam welding, an offsetting of 55 to 100% in relation to the weld impact

is maintained, so that between 55 and 100% of the incidence face of the beam
strikes the repair plate (7) and the rest the blade-stump (6).
A method according to any one of claims 2 to 9, characterised in that the
offsetting of the energy source in relation to the weld impact is greater in the

edge area of the blade-stump (6) than in the area of the profile centre.
A method according to any one of claims 2 to 10, characterised in that a local
offsetting of the energy source is maintained between 75 and 100% in the edge

area, and between 55 and 80% in the area of the profile centre, in relation to the 
face of the arc base of a tungsten-plasma-arc-welding nozzle which is directed

onto the repair plate (7) or onto the incidence face of a laser or electron beam
which strikes the repair plate (7).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that a seam
tracking system is employed for the detection and automation of the butt

welding, a pre-set course of a local offsetting relative to the weld impact edge
being maintained.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that a laser
beam is employed for separating-off, the molten material being blown out by

means of a jet of inert gas, consisting preferably of nitrogen or argon.
An application of the method according to any one of claims 1 to 13 for repairing
the blades of integral turbine wheels of a turbo engine or turbine wheel blades

when mounted on the turbine wheel disk.
An application of the method according to any one of claims 1 to 13 for repairing
compressor blades.
