<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for securing computer systems, especially a system (2) used in microcomputing including at least one SCSI port, including means (5) for enciphering confidential information flowing through the information system (2), and including a peripheral (1), communicating with the information system (2) via an SCSI bus, including an interface (3) between the SCSI bus and a bus internal to the peripheral (1), placing the information management and storage means (4) in communication with the enciphering means (5) contained in the peripheral (1), as well as with an interface (6) between a user and the peripheral (1), making it possible to offer the security services relating to the confidential information flowing through the peripheral (1) independently of the bus and utilization system standards used by the information system (2). Application: logic unit for encipherment in microcomputing.
