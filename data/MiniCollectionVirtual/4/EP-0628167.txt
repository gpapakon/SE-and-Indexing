<ABSTRACT>
A hematology control product comprising leukocyte analogs is described. The analogs comprise red blood cells which simulate at least two physical properties of human leukocytes. A method for making leukocyte analogs from blood cells having desired physical properties is also described. The process comprises expanding the cell volume, changing the hemoglobin content of the cell and fixing the cell. Generally, the monocyte and lymphocyte analogs leak hemoglobin from the cell while the eosinophil analog has the hemoglobin pricipitated in the cell. A further method is described to use the control product to determine whether an automatic instrument is operating within manufacturer's specification.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reference blood cell
analogs for devices using electronic and optical means,
suspension media therefor, and processes for making and
using the analogs and suspension media in a control
product.Quality control long has been a necessary and routine
procedure in clinical hematology. Accuracy in the
counting of red blood cells and white blood cells,
including differentiating among the subpopulations of
white blood cells is dependent, in part, upon the use of
adequate control products. With the numerous types of
equipment for particle counting now available, quality
control by the use of control products is necessary, since
the possibility of malfunctioning of the instrument is
ever present. The traditional method of maintaining a
quality control program for automatic particle counting
equipment has consisted of providing fresh human blood as
a whole blood standard. However, this fresh blood is
usable for only one day, therefore, durable blood products
were developed.Hematology control products, which contain reference
blood cell analogs, which monitor the accuracy and
precision of blood cell counting devices are especially
important. It is recognized that there is a present need
for new reference blood cell analogs for maintaining the
accuracy of white cell differentiation and other
parameters when employing such blood cell counting
devices.Control products should approximate that of fresh
whole blood as closely as possible. Attempts have been 
made to provide suitably sized particles in stable
suspensions by the use of ragweed pollen, polystyrene,
latex, various organic materials and fixed human red
cells. None of these suspensions have proved suitable for
use as a control product for white cell differentiation of
at least four subpopulations of leukocytes.The material used for maintaining quality control,
hereinafter called a hematology control product or control
product, can under specific circumstances be used also to
calibrate hematology instruments. For the purposes of
this invention, the control product will contain one or
more analogs suspended in a liquid media which, when
analyzed, simulates at least one physical or biological
property of blood which the instrument is capable of
analyzing. As used herein, an analog is defined as a
particle which simulates at least one physical or
biological property of a target population. As such,
some automatic machines are able to analyze only certain
components of a control product, despite the control
product having additional

<CLAIMS>
A hematology control product which contains at least
two leukocyte analog populations comprising red blood cells

whose hemoglobin content or volume has been treated so that
the cells are resistant to degradation by lytic reagents

used in hematological test procedures, characterised in
that the product simulates at least two different human

leukocytes, each having at least two physical properties of
a human leukocyte, the properties being selected from


a. volume measured by D.C. current,
b. high frequency (RF) size,
c. opacity, and
d. light scatter.
A hematology control product comprising blood cells
which have been treated so that they are resistant to

degradation by lytic reagents used in hematological test
procedures, characterised in that the product contains at

least four different analogs which simulate at least four
different human leukocytes, each having at least two

physical properties as defined in claim 1.
The product of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein one of the
physical properties is light scatter.
The product of any preceding claim, wherein the blood
cells used to simulate one of the human leukocytes have

been expanded greater than 30% of their original volume.
The product of any preceding claim, which contains at
least four leukocyte analogs which are distributed within

at least four different boundaries of analysis, the
boundaries of analysis being made on the basis of light

scatter, volume and opacity.
The product of any preceding claim, wherein the
treated blood cells have a changed hemoglobin content.
The product of claim 6, wherein the hemoglobin has
been denatured within the treated blood cells.
The product of claim 6, wherein the hemoglobin has
leaked from the treated blood cells.
The product of claim 8, wherein 20-80% of the
hemoglobin has leaked from the treated blood cells. 
A method for determining if an instrument is
functioning with specification, comprising:


a. placing the product of any preceding claim in
the instrument,
b. measuring said physical properties of the
control product, and
c. reporting the results of the measuring.
A method for the manufacture of leukocyte analogs,
comprising:


a. mixing a red blood cell with a hypoosmotic
solution to expand the volume of the cell,
b. changing the hemoglobin content of the cell, to
simulate the light scatter properties of human

leukocyte cells, and
c. fixing the cell so that it is resistant to
degradation by lytic reagents used in a

hematological test procedure, the fixed cell
having light scatter and volume properties

similar to human leukocytes.
The method of claim 11, wherein step (b) comprises
denaturing the hemoglobin in the cell.
The method of claim 11, wherein step (b) comprises
leaking hemoglobin from the cell.
The method of claim 13, wherein the hemoglobin content
of the cell is reduced by between 20-80%.
The method of any of claims 11 to 14, wherein the cell
is mixed with a serum substance, and then with the

hypoosmotic solution.
The method of claim 15, wherein the serum substance is

cholesterol, lipoprotein cholesterol esters, cholesterol
combined with phospholipids, and mixtures thereof.
The method of any of claims 11 to 16, wherein the cell
