<ABSTRACT>
In the case of outflow arrangements 1 which hinder the opening of a window or of a cupboard door or the like, the required unobstructing position can be readily achieved for the housewife in that the fitting 2 is provided with a bayonet-type plug-in closure 10 which makes it possible to remove the fitting 2 completely and lay it to one side. In the released state, the overall height is then only a fraction of the conventional fitting height, with the result that the window and cupboard door can be actuated without difficulty. Unintentional removal of the fitting body 8 from the fitting holder 7 is prevented in that the supplementary arresting means 50, which is displaceably arranged in the fitting body 8, is pushed into the outer plate 39 of the fitting holder 7. Only when the securing bolt 51 of the supplementary arresting means 50 has been drawn out is it then possible to actuate the bayonet-type plug-in closure 10.
