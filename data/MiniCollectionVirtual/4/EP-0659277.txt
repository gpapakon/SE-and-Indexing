<ABSTRACT>
A process and appropriate device are disclosed for determining the androstenone content of adipose tissues in clearly shorter times. The disclosed process has the following steps: (a) liquefying an adipose tissue sample by heating up to a predetermined temperature in the 45 to 60  C range; (b) mixing a defined amount of the liquid fat with a water-soluble solvent for androstenone at the temperature of the liquid; (c) cooling the fat/solvent mixture down to a predetermined temperature, at which a substantial proportion of the fat dissolved in the solvent is separated from the solution whereas the major part of the androstenone dissolved in the solvent phase remains dissolved in the solvent; (d) sampling of a defined amount of the androstenone-containing solvent phase and diluting it in a predetermined ratio with an aqueous buffer solution admissible for the used detection process; (e) determining the androstenone content of the solvent/buffer solution phase by means of known per se competitive immunological detection reactions.

Process for the determination of androstenone-contents in fatty tissues, 
comprising the following steps: 


a) Liquefying a sample of adipose tissue by heating to a predetermined 
temperature in the range of from 45 to 60°C; 
b) mixing a defined amount of the liquid fat with a water soluble solvent 
for the androstenone at the temperature of the liquid fat; 
c) cooling the fat/solvent mixture to a predetermined temperature, at which 
considerable portions of the fat dissolved in the solvent are separated 

from the solution but the major part of the androstenone dissolved in 
the solvent phase remains dissolved in the solvent; 
d) removing a defined amount of the androstenone containing solvent phase 
and diluting it in a predetermined ratio with an aqueous buffer solution 

compatible with the detection procedure; 
e) determination of the androstenone content of the solvent/buffer solution 
phase with known competitive immunological detection reactions. 
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that the solvent has good 
dissolving properties for the androstenone to be detected in the temperature 

range from about 20 to about 60°C and a temperature coefficient 
for the fat solubility which is larger than the temperature coefficient in 

this temperature range for the androstenone solubility. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 and/or 2, characterized in 
that the solvent has at the most a small effect on the enzymes which 

are optionally used in the detection reaction system.  
 
Process according to one or more of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the solvent has at the most a slight effect on antigen/antibody 

reactions of the detection reaction system. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that the solvent comprises 
up to 100% by volume methanol. 
Process according to one or more of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the mixing ratio of the liquid fat sample to the solvent is 

chosen in the range of from 0.1:10 to 1:10 ratio by volume. 
Process according to claims 6, characterized in that the mixing ratio is 
chosen in the range from 0.2:10 to 0.5:10. 
Process according to one or more of the claims 1 to 7 characterized 
in that the dilution of the solvent phase is carried out with a buffer 

solution in a ratio of from 20:80 to 5:95 by volume. 
Process according to one or more of the claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that in the cooling step the final temperature of the sample is 

chosen such that the dissolved fat is separated out of the solvent to 
such an extent that an essentially fat phase-free solution is obtained in 

the subsequent dilution step d). 
Process according to one or more of the claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that in step e) 


(1) a receptacle plate is coated with an antibody serum, and the antibodies 
are immobilized on the receptacle plate, with the antibodies reacting 

specifically with androstenones, in particular 5α-androst-16-en-3-one;  
 
(2) the immobilized antibodies are incubated simultaneously with a defined 
amount of an enzyme-labeled androstenone and with a predetermined 

volume of the solvent-containing buffer solution obtained in step d) at 
a temperature of about 42 to 48°C, preferably at about 45°C for a 

predetermined time; 
(3) the unbound enzyme-labeled and free androstenone is removed and the 
coated receptacle plate is washed; 
(4) a buffer solution containing a substrate is placed on the receptacle 
plate, whereupon the substrate enters into an enzyme reaction with the 

marker enzyme; 
(5) the enzyme reaction is carried out for a predetermined time at a 
predetermined temperature and then stopped with a suitable reaction; 

and 
(6) the reaction conversion of the enzymatic reaction is determined, preferably 
by photospectrometry. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in that as a receptacle 
plate a microtiter plate is used. 
Device for carrying out a process according to one or more of the 
preceding claims automatically, having a heatable sample input station 

for receiving and liquefying the adipose tissue sample; 

comprising a temperature-controllable, programmable pipetting device 
with a plurality of sample reception devices for carrying out process 

steps b), c) and d) according to one or more of the preceding claims  
 
and, optionally, additional steps (2), (3), (4), (5) according to claims 
10 and/or 11; and comprising a measuring device for direct or indirect 

determination of a measured variable reflecting the androstenone content 
of the adipose tissue sample.
