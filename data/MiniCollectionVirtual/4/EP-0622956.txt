<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus and method for recording 
inputted digital video and audio signals of one field, 

which are synchronous with each other, onto a plurality 
of inclined tracks of a magnetic tape using a plurality 

sets of helical scan type magnetic heads provided in a 
rotation head drum at predetermined angle intervals, a 

read clock is generated. A read address of a first field 
memory is generated based on the read clock, so that the 

inputted digital video signal is read out and recorded 
onto both end portions of each of the inclined tracks of 

the magnetic tape, after starting recording the inputted 
digital video signal of one field onto an end of the 

inclined track, and ending recording the inputted digital 
video signal of one field onto another end of the other 

inclined track. On the other hand, a read address of a 
second field memory is generated based on the read clock, 

so that the inputted digital audio signal is read out and 
recorded onto the middle portion of each of the inclined 

tracks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
and a method for respectively recording digital video and
audio signals, and in particular, to an apparatus and a
method for respectively recording digital video and audio
signals in both end portions and a middle portion of each
inclined track of a magnetic tape, such as a helical scan
head type digital video tape recorder (referred to as a
"digital VTR" hereinafter).Fig. 8 is a timing chart of a signal processing
in recording and reproducing a digital audio signal by a
conventional D-1 type digital VTR which a 1/2 inch
digital VTR for use in broadcasting made based on a
standard of the SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and
Television Engineers). Such standard is disclosed in SMPTE-Journal, vol. 96, no. 12, December 1987,
pages 1166 to 1172, "A Review of the Signal Format Specification for the 4:2:2
Component Digital VTR" from J. Wilkinson.When it is tried as an editing process to execute a cross-fade editing process
wherein first video and audio signals are faded in and second video and audio
signals are faded out crossing fading in and fading out operations, by means of the
conventional D-1 type digital VRT with reproducing magnetic heads which are put
in advance of recording magnetic heads by 8.5 segments as shown in Fig. 8, any
time interval required for the digital audio signal reproducing process cannot be
established as shown in b4 of Fig. 8, and therefore the cross-fade editing cannot
be executed.Fig. 14 shows a tape format showing a method of recording digital video and audio
signals which is used in the conventional D-1 type digital VTR.A similar method and a corresponding recording and reproducing apparatus using
the above-mentioned technique standard is disclosed in EP-A-0 241 014
representing the closest prior art from which the invention proceeds. Referring to Fig. 14, reference numeral 100
denotes a recording magnetic tape having a width of 1/2
inch. A queue audio track 101 is formed in the top part
of the magnetic tape 100, while a control track 102 and a
time code track 103 are formed in the bottom part of the
magnetic tape 100. In Fig. 14, a tape running direction
and a corresponding head rotation direction are shown.A digital audio signal is recorded in the
middle portion of each inclined track in the D-1 type
digital VTR. In this case, since the boundaries each
between respective adjacent fields are placed in the
middle portion of each inclined track, namely, the start
point and the end point of each field interval is placed
in the middle
