<ABSTRACT>
A machine for engraving reliefs on the surface 
of hides in general, of those destined to stamp a relief 

on the surface of a previously treated hide, characterized 
in that it is constituted by a high frequency generator 

having a useful power of 300 KW, an airtight press having 
a maximium closing force of 300 metric tons, a set of automatic 

trays, a water/water heat-exchanger for refrigerating 
the generator, a water/water heat-exchanger for refrigerating 

moulds, and a hydraulic station, and the airtight press 
has six oleohydraulic cylinders of 200 mm diameter each, 

and a stroke of 100 mm, as well as two additional cylinders 
having a diameter of 80 mm and a stroke of 150 mm, for performing 

displacements, the pressure coming from an adjustable 
pressure hydraulic station put on the press.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to a machine for engraving 
reliefs on the surface of hides or other materials in general, 
the obvious purpose of which is to be configured as a machine 
capable of engraving different shapes and reliefs on the surface 
of a hide or other materials, which, before being incorporated 
into the machine in question, have been properly treated, the surface 
of the hide exhibiting a coating formed by different products, 
which, once incorporated into the machine and this operates, exhibit 
shapes totally different to the original hide before being 
treated. This invention applies to the industry dedicated to the treatment 
of hides and skins or other materials in general, having a 
later application in the footwear and morocco leather articles 
and the manufacture of products based on skins or hides. The machine for engraving reliefs on the surface of hides in 
general as proposed by the invention, constitutes per se an evi-solution 
to the present problems on this matter, since, starting 
from same and after an appropiate treatment of the hide by using 
adequate processes, the resultant product can be utilized in different 
applications, being strengthened and capable of being utilized 
for manufacturing different articles that, without the action 
of the machine, they could not be used.  In a more definite way, the machine for engraving reliefs on 
the surface of hides in general is constituted starting from the 
utilization of a high frequency generator with a useful power of 
300 kW, which can be utilized totally or in part; the machine 
being also fitted with a hermetic press with a closing force of 
maximum 300 metric tons. At the same time, the invention contemplates to utilize a set 
of two automatic trays,a water/water heatexchanger to refrigerate 
the high frequency generator, and a second water/water heatexchanger 
in order to refrigerate the moulds. Also, the invention contemplates the existence of a supporting 
hydraulic station. Obviously, this machine must rely on an adequate electric connection, 
and, optionally, it is recommended that the plant relies 
on a 100 amp. automatic switch, fitted with an adjustable thermal 
relay and a series fuse with an adequate capacity. Also, it is necessary to rely on an air connection having an 
air intake of 400 liter/minute, this air being later compressed 
at 10 bars. On the lines of the mentioned above in relation to the heatexchangers, 
the plant must rely on a water connection to cool 
the generator heatexchanger to

1.- A machine for engraving reliefs on the surface of hides in 
general, of those destined to stamp a relief on the surface of a 

previously treated hide, characterized in that it is constituted 
by a high frequency generator having a useful power of 300 KW, 

an airtight press having a maximum closing force of 300 metric 
tons, a set of automatic trays, a water/water heat-exchanger for 

refrigerating the generator, a water/water heat-exchanger for refrigerating 
moulds, and a hydraulic station. 
2.- A machine for engraving reliefs on the surface of hides in 
general, according to claim 1, characterized in that the airtight 

press has six oleohydraulic cylinders of 200 mm diameter each, 
and a stroke of 100 mm, as well as two additional cylinders having 

a diameter of 80 mm and a stroke of 150 mm, for performing 
displacements, the pressure coming from an adjustable pressure 

hydraulic station put on the press. 
3.- A machine for engraving reliefs on the surface of hides in 
general, according to the precedent claims, characterized in that 

it has a high frequency generator based on a shielded resonant 
cavity driven by a single ceramic coaxial triode having a rated 

power of 540 KW, working at 12 KW, 37 amp., d/c. 
4.- A machine for engraving reliefs on the surface of hides in 
general, according to the precedent claims, characterized in that 

the two trays are automatic and are symmetric and sideways located, 
being driven by means of a senoidal mechanism and hydraulic 

power coming from the hydraulic station, each tray being constituted 
by a lower part and a upper part, the hide being placed on 

the upper part of the lower tray, and a silicone mould being - 
placed on the lower part of the upper tray, the upper tray being 

lifted after finishing each cycle so allowing the treated hide to 
be moved away and a new previously treated hide to be placed on.
