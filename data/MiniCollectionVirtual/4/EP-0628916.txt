<ABSTRACT>
Typical prior-art microprocessors use separate (i.e., non-multiplexed) 
address and data busses, or else a single multiplexed address/data bus, to 

communicate with external devices (e.g., memory chips). The use of separate busses 
provides for high speed operation, whereas the use of a multiplexed bus provides for 

a reduced number of pins for both the microprocessor and the IC's that communicate 
with it over the bus. In the present invention, a microprocessor (100) includes both a 

non-multiplexed address-only bus (101), as well as a multiplexed address/data bus 
(102). The multiplexed bus provides for communication with external devices (105, 

106) that require a multiplexed bus, typically for reduced pin count of the external 
device. The non-multiplexed address bus provides for ease of interfacing with 

memory (103, 104, 107) or other devices, by avoiding the necessity of an address 
latch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuit (IC) processors and 
systems that utilize them. One type of prior-art microprocessor uses a multiplexed address/data 
bus, wherein addresses and data are time multiplexed on the same bus conductors. 
For example, the Intel 8086 includes 20 pins for transmitting addresses (A0 - A19) 
over a 20-conductor bus. In addition, 16 data bits (D0 - D15) are multiplexed onto 
16 of these same pins, whereas 4 status bits (S3 - S6) are multiplexed onto the 
remaining 4 pins. This design allows for minimizing the number of bus conductors, 
and hence for minimizing the number of integrated circuit terminals (e.g., pins as 
packaged) that must be devoted to connecting to the bus. Note that the pin count is 
reduced for both the microprocessor and for the devices with which it communicates 
over the multiplexed bus. This is significant in that the package size of at least some 
of the ICs on the bus may be reduced as compared to those for use with separate 
address/data busses, since the pin count is reduced. The reduction in package size is 
especially advantageous in systems where circuit board space is at a premium; for 
example, in laptop computers, personnel communication systems, cellular phones, 
and other portable apparatus. However, the devices on a multiplexed bus must include some means 
for separating the address portion of the signals on the bus from the data portion. 
This is typically accomplished using latches that are clocked by a system clock so as 
to capture only the address portion of the bus signals. In some cases, the latches may 
be readily included in the IC being addressed. However, in other cases, especially in 
some types of memory devices, latches are not normally included in the IC itself, 
requiring an extra IC for implementing the latch. The extra space required for this 
latch at least partially defeats the space-savings gained by the use of the multiplexed 
bus, and the latch adds to the system cost. Another type of prior-art microprocessor uses separate (i.e., non-multiplexed) 
address and data busses to communicate with external devices. Such 
external devices may include memory chips, input/output devices, or other logic 
chips, for example. The use of separate busses provides for high speed operation,  
 
since addresses and data may simultaneously be transmitted. Furthermore, there is 
no ambiguity as to which type of information is present on the bus, and so the 
information may be used by the destination device at any time that
