<ABSTRACT>
Composition based on dust-free biopolymer with rapid hydration, containing a biopolymer and a surfactant in a quantity of the order of 0.1 to 3 %, preferably of the order of 0.1 to 1.5 % of the weight of the said composition. The biopolymer preferably consists of a xanthan gum or of a succinoglucan in the form of nonglobular and nonovoid particles. The said composition may be employed as thickening agent or suspending agent for the preparation of industrial, alimentary, cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulations.
