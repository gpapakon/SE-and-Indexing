<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a universal rotary power-generating machine that turns the pressure energy of fluids directly into mechanical or electric energy, depending on the demand, or changes the state parameters of the working fluid so that the operating principle, the construction form, and the efficiency may not undergo significant modifications when the working fluid (water, air, steam, gases, exhaust or exit gases, oil or combinations of such fluids) is changed. The technical problem solved by the invention is the development of a multifunctional URPM of simple and rugged construction, balanced, compact, reliable, with uniform running, having an improved efficiency as compared with existing power-generating machines, which reduces the speeding-up and braking times under 1.5 s (from 0 rpm to max rpm or from max rpm to 0 rpm) by the mere closing of the general supply valve for the working fluid, without a separate braking system being required.

 SpecificationUNIVERSAL ROTARY POWER-GENERATING MACHINE10 HELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a universal rotary power-generating machine (URPM) which transforms the pressure energy of certain working fluids into mechanical15 or electric energy, depending on the demand, or changes the state parameters of the working fluid so that the operating principle, the construction form, and the efficiency may not undergo significant modifications when the working fluid (water, air, steam, gases, exhaust or exit gases, oil or combinations of such fluids) is changed, this machine20 being able to run on any of the mentioned fluids.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART25 The existing rotaiy power-generating machines have a number of disadvantages, such as:. low efficiency, - 0 . they do not run on a diversified range of working fluids (with different machines with different characteristics are required),. big size and weight,. high prime cost, 35 ■ complex construction,. big working-fluid consumption,. high degree of environment pollution,. special works and skilled personnel are required for repairs and maintenance,. non-uniform running,. existance of dead centres in operation,. strong noise and vibrations, .5 . manufacturing difficulties with small-size machines,. long speeding-up and braking times. 

 SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTIONThe purpose of the invention is the development of a multifunctional URPM having important advantages for ecology achieved by the highly-efficient utilization of primary and other energies due to the adopted functional and construction solution, at a low prime cost allowing its quick implementation in economy and industry.The technical problem solved by the invention is the development of a jLo multifunctional URPM of simple and rugged construction, balanced, compact, reliable, with a uniform running that reduces the speeding-up and braking times under 1.5 s (from 0 rpm to max rpm or from max rpm to 0 rpm), and whose efficiency is improved as compared with existing power-generating machines first of all due to the highly-efficient15 utilisation of primary and other energies.The URPM according to the invention eliminates the disadvantages mentioned earlier owing to the fact that its constructions includes only a few active parts of which only one is in motion, this being the rotor which operates between two stator plates, an upper plate and a lower one, where the direct transformation of the pressure energy of the working fluid into mechanical energy occurs, which

1. Universal rotary power-generating machine (URPM), in accordance with the invention, characterized by the fact that it transforms the pressure energy of certain working fluids in mechanical or electric energy, depending on the demand, or changes the state parameters of the working fluid so that the operating principle, the construction form, and the efficiency may not undergo significand modifications when the working fluid (water, air, steam, gases, exhaust or exit gases, oil or combinations of such fluids) is changed, with the view of obtaining a highly-efficient utilisation of primary and other energies, at a low prime cost allowing its quick implementation in economy and industiy, with great advantages for ecology, composed of : supply nipple 1, distributing cap 2, stator plate 3, rotor 4, distance ring 5, cap 6, inner packing 7, outer packing 8. stuffing- box 9, magnetic circuit 10, winding 11, sheath 12, electric cable 13, centring bolt 14, adjusting screw 15, and shaft 16. The working fluid enters tangentiaily through the supply nipple 1, the distributing cap 2 ensuring the supply with working fluid through the stator plate 3 of rotor 4, the positioning of which is provided by the distance ring 5, cap 6 prevents the working fluid from entering the central zone of rotor 4, forcing it to pass through stator plate 3 to come to work in the blading of rotor 4, the stator plates 3 ensure a uniform loading of both faces of rotor 4, which - together with an adequate control of the input parameters of the working fluid - makes it possible to compensate the axial travels (appearance of self-suspension) and to set rotor 4 in motion. The rotational motion of rotor 4 allows the filling and emptying of the blading three times ^ during a full rotation. The filling of the blading occurs in the active zone of stator plates 3, and the emptying - in the negative zone of stator plates 3, and, as a result, rotor 4 has a big carrying capacity relative to its size. Rotor 4 transforms the pressure energy of the working fluid directly into mechanical energy, which can be transmitted to the exterior according to Fig. 8, or in electric energy in accordance with Fig. 1. If the change of .state 0 parameters of the working fluid is intended, the machine will look as shown in Fig. 9. Rotor 4 has the foπn shown in Fig. 4, with the blading symmetrically made on both faces, on rach face there are eight cells shaped like sphere quarters, placed equidistant]} and symmetrically on a division circle of radius R and forming between them an angle ς = 45 the space between two consecutive ceDs - measured on the division circle of 5 radius R - is equal to the radius r of the .sphere of which the cell forms a part between 



 36 the length of the division circle of radius R, the cells and the spaces between them there exists the relation 2 II R = 16 r. Stator plates 3 are represented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, according to which the active zone of stator plates 3 is divided into six sections, of which three - which come in contact with rotor 4 - cover an angle a = 65° and are called ^° positive surfaces, and the other three - which cover an angle β

 55° each - are called negative surfaces. The transition from a positive surface to a negative surface occurs at an angle δ = 45°. Stator plates 3 have three nozzles each, placed at an angle γ = 120°. one on each positive section of stator plates 3 and positioned on a division circle of radius R. The nozzles are tangent to the division circle of radius R and foπn an angle 5 ξ = 45° with the positive surface on which they are located. The distance ring 5 is represented in Fig. 5, according to which it has six sections of which three ensure the outflow of the working fluid and cover an angle a = 65° each, and the other three ensure the optimal framing of the rotor 4 between the two stator plates 3 and the disnioumablc assemnling of the machine by means of distributing caps 2; they cover an angle β - 55'
50 each. At the impact against the blading of rotor 4 the working fluid undergoes a deviation of 180°: its parameters can also be controlled via the spherical valves and the manometers mounted at the machine inlet . On the surface of rotor 4 there are no point-* which, in operation, are in permanent contact with stator plates 3. The ratio of the

. positive surface on the faces of rotor 4 to its negative surfaces is 1. The ratio of the positive surfaces of rotor 4 to the positive surfaces of stator plates 3 with which the first come in contact is 1. The rotor faces have a taper ς = 6.5 . and the positive surfaces of stator plates 3 - its conjugate (ξ, = 6.5"). The negative surfaces of stator plates 3 also have a taper ξ = 6,5°, so,that between the positive surface and the negative surface of g Q stator plates 3 there is an angle 2 ξ = 13°. For a good taking over of the working fluid which has worked in the blading of rotor 4 and its routing to the exterior, the angle ς = 6.5 also exists on the distance ring 5 and the distributing caps 2. The inner packing 7 prevents the working fluid from entering the central zone, and the outer packing 8 prevents the working fluid from foiowing out to the exterior before it has worked in the blading of rotor 4. A stuffingbox system 9 ensures the transmission to the exterior of the
° 5 electric energy through the electric cable 13 or of the mechanical energy by means of the shaft 16 in accordance with Fig. 8. In the central recess of rotor 4 a magnetic circuit 10 can be fixed, which - by rotating round the winding J I housed in sheath 12 - begins to produce electric energy, and the sheath 12 is fastened in a centred manner relative to thc
69 magnetic circuit 10. via the caD 6. the bolt 14. and the adiustinε .screw 15
