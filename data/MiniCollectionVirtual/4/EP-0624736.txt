<ABSTRACT>
Rotary oscillation damper for use on the outer circumference of a shaft (1) which rotates about an axis and connects two enlargements (6) to each other. The rotary oscillation damper comprises half-shells (2) which can be pressed against the outer circumference and are connected by spring elements (3) deformable in the circumferential direction to at least two inertial masses (4) designed as circular segments, the inertial masses (4) being connected to one another by holding elements, the holding elements being fixed by at least one ring (5) which surrounds the inertial masses (4) radially at the outside, and the ring (5) having an inside diameter which is larger than the diameter of at least the smallest of the enlargements (6).

A torsional vibration damper for use on the 
outside circumference of a shaft (1) which rotates about 

an axis and has thickenings (6) at both its ends, comprising 
semi-shells (2) which can be pressed against the 

outside circumference and are connected to at least two 
inertia masses (4) of segment-like design by spring 

elements (3) which can be deformed in the circumferential 
direction, the inertia masses (4) being connected to one 

another by holding elements, characterized in that the 
holding elements are fastened between the two thickenings 

(6) and are fixed by at least one ring (5) which surrounds 
the inertia masses (4) radially on the outer side, 

and in that the ring (5) has an inside diameter which is 
greater than the outside diameter at least of the 

smallest one of the thickenings (6). 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
1, characterized in that the ring (5) is coated with 

rubber. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
1, characterized in that the inertia masses (4) are 

provided with a rubber coating (7), and in that the ring 
(5) is pressed onto the latter. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
1, characterized in that at least two rings (5) are 

provided, which are arranged in the region of the front 
ends of the inertia masses (4). 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
1, characterized in that the ring (5) has a rectangular 

shape. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim  
 

1, characterized in that the ring (5) is designed as a 
further inertia mass. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
6, characterized in that the further inertia mass and the 

inertia masses (4) are flexibly connected by an intermediate 
layer (8) made of rubber. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
1, characterized in that the ring (5) is bounded on the 

inner side by a surface which ends in a skid-like manner 
in the axial direction. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
1, characterized in that the ring (5) is shrunk on. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 
1, characterized in that the ring (5) can be sprung open 

in the radial direction and is provided with a separation 
in the radial direction at a point on the circumference.
