<ABSTRACT>
To eliminate a vertically asymmetrical deflection, a 
rolling mill comprises a device for measuring horizontal 

deflections of upper and lower work rolls 2, 3 during 
rolling, a device for comparing values measured on the 

upper and lower sides and calculating the difference therebetween, 
and a horizontal deflection controller for determining 

whether the difference exceeds a predetermined range 
or not and imparting a horizontal bending to at least one 

of the work rolls. To eliminate a transversely asymmetrical 
deflection, a rolling mill comprises a device for 

measuring horizontal deflections of at least one of the 
work rolls at axially spaced positions during rolling, a 

device for comparing values measured on at the axially 
spaced positions and calculating the difference therebetween, 

and a horizontal deflection controller for determining 
whether the difference exceeds a predetermined range or 

not and imparting a horizontal bending to the one work roll 
at at least one of the axially spaced positions. This 

prevents an adverse effect by the work rolls being horizontally 
deflected in a vertically or transversely asymmetrical 

way, reduces the diameter of the work rolls, and increases 
the allowable rolling load. Stable rolling of 

high-quality strips with good shape or flatness is thus 
achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a strip rolling mill 
and method, and more particularly to a rolling mill having 
small-diameter work rolls suitable for rolling of hard or 
extremely thin strips, and a rolling method for use with 
the rolling mill. Hitherto, small-diameter work rolls have been employed 
for rolling of hard or extremely thin strips made of, e.g., 
stainless steel. As the diameter of work rolls is reduced, 
bending rigidity becomes smaller correspondingly, which 
causes a deflection in the horizontal plane, particularly, 
as a problem. Therefore, cluster type multi-high rolling 
mills including a Sendzimir mill, and rolling mills 
equipped with a horizontal deflection preventing mechanism 
to horizontally support work roll barrels by support rolls, 
as disclosed in JP, A, 60-18206, have been developed. 
However, because these rolling mills employ support rolls 
divided in the axial direction, the divided rolls produce 
transferred marks on strips, which deteriorate the strip's 
surface texture. To deal with such a problem, the applicant 
has previously proposed a rolling mill, as disclosed 
in JP, A, 5-50109, which prevents deterioration of the 
strip's surface texture and permits practical use of small-diameter  
 
work rolls. In that rolling mill, multiple rows of support rolls 
are installed on each of the entry and delivery (back and 
front) sides so as to support both end portions of a work 
roll barrel outwardly of the passage of strips having a 
maximum width, and outermost one of the support rolls is 
associated with a cylinder for bending the work roll horizontally. 
A horizontal deflection is prevented by the 
following three measures; (a) the work roll is set to such 
an offset position before the start of rolling as that the 
horizontal force exerted on the work roll will be 0, (b) 
the offset position of the work roll is also adjusted 
during the rolling so that the horizontal force is kept at 
0, and (c) the horizontal deflection is detected during the 
rolling and the bending cylinder is controlled so that the 
detected horizontal deflection is kept at 0. This type of 
mill will be hereinafter referred to as a UC-1F mill. JP, A, 61-182807 also discloses a rolling mill provided 
with measures similar to the above (a) and (b). Further, 
JP, A, 1-180708 proposes a technique of not only controlling 
the horizontal deflection of a work roll through 
an adjustment of the offset position of the work roll and 
horizontal bending control by a bending cylinder, but also 
performing
