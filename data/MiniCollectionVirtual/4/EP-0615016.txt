<ABSTRACT>
The impregnation of the web (2) is effected in a U-shaped shaft consisting of two limbs (3, 4) and a connecting region (5) between the two limbs. The shaft has been filled with peroxide liquor. The supply of new peroxide liquor but also the recirculation thereof in the limbs is preferably effected underneath the liquor level. Owing to the low bath volume and the rapid liquor exchange, the peroxide liquor can be heated to a temperature above 50@C without becoming unstable.

A method of continuously bleaching a textile fabric web (2) by 

means of an in particular alkaline peroxide bath characterised in that 
the fabric web is passed in a stretched condition through a U-shaped 

shaft (3, 4, 5) whose side walls closely embrace the fabric web and 
which is filled with the peroxide bath, that the peroxide bath in the 

shaft is maintained at a temperature of over 50Â°C, that fresh peroxide 
bath is supplied preferably below the level of the bath to maintain the 

volume of bath in the shaft constant, and that the impregnated fabric 
web is fed to a steamer (36) after leaving the shaft. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the peroxide 
bath is supplied and removed respectively on both sides of the fabric 

web in the legs of the shaft. 
A method according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in 
that the level of the bath is measured and that when the level of the 

bath sinks fresh peroxide bath is introduced in the connecting region 
(5) between the two legs (3, 4) of the shaft. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
the concentration of the peroxide bath is measured and that upon a 

variation in concentration either concentrate or diluent is added. 
A method according to claim 4 characterised in that the 
concentration of the peroxide bath is measured in the connecting region 

(5) between the two legs of the shaft. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
an equal amount of concentrate or diluent is added continuously in 

accordance with the previously ascertained difference in the degree of 
charging between the fabric web when it is introduced and removed.  

 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that 
in both legs (3, 4) of the shaft the peroxide bath is removed at one end 

and added at the other end selectively in counter-flow relationship or 
in co-flow relationship with the fabric web (2). 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
the walls (6 to 9) of the U-shaped shaft are heated. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that 
the bath concentration is maintained at a value of 10 to 80 ml H
