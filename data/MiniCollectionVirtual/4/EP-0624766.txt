<ABSTRACT>
A cryogenic rectification system wherein 
compressed feed (101) is further compressed in a compressor (5) 

coupled to a turboexpander (7) and turboexpanded through 
the turboexpander to drive the compressor, and a 

portion (102) of the feed which does not undergo 
turboexpansion is condensed against liquid oxygen in a 

product boiler (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for producing oxygen by cryogenic rectification. Oxygen is produced commercially in large 
quantities by the cryogenic rectification of feed air, 
generally employing the well known double column 
system, wherein product oxygen is taken from the lower 
pressure column. At times it may be desirable to 
produce oxygen at a pressure which exceeds its pressure 
when taken from the lower pressure column. In such 
instances, gaseous oxygen may be compressed to the 
desired pressure. However, it is generally preferable, 
both for safety and for operating cost purposes, to 
remove oxygen as liquid from the lower pressure column, 
pump it to a higher pressure, and then vaporize the 
pressurized liquid oxygen to produce the desired 
elevated pressure product oxygen gas. Cryogenic rectification requires 
refrigeration in order to operate. The requisite 
refrigeration is increased when oxygen is withdrawn 
from the column as liquid and pumped prior to 
vaporization because the pump work is added to the 
system. Refrigeration may be provided to the cryogenic 
process by the turboexpansion of a stream fed into the 
rectification column system. However, the compression  
 
of a stream for the turboexpansion consumes a 
significant amount of energy. From US-A-5 069 699 there is known a process for the production of 
nitrogen by distilling air in a column system comprising a high pressure column and 
a low pressure column associated functionally with an extra high pressure column. 
This known process particularly is concerned with the provision of a dual pathway 
condensation of nitrogen streams in reboiler/condensers located in the stripping 
section of the low pressure column to provide condensed high pressure and extra 
high pressure nitrogen streams. A method for producing oxygen by cryogenic rectification comprising: 
(A) compressing feed air and cooling the compressed feed air 
by indirect heat exchange with return streams 
by passage through a main heat exchanger ; (B) turboexpanding at least some of the feed air by passing it 
through a turboexpander but maintaining at least some feed air from undergoing 
said turboexpansion; (C) introducing turboexpanded feed air into the higher pressure 
column of a double column cryogenic rectification plant; (D) condensing at least some of the feed air, which is not 
turboexpanded, by indirect heat exchange with boiling liquid oxygen in a product 
boiler; (E) subcooling the resulting condensed feed air; (F) introducing
