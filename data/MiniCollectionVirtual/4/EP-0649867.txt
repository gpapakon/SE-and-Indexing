<ABSTRACT>
A highly stable oil in water emulsion comprising a nonionic 
surfactant, a cationic or anionic surfactant, and a viscous 

oil phase (such as an epoxide polymer or an alkyd resin) 
wherein the viscosity of the oil phase can be as high as 

about 10

 cP, the average particle size is less than about 
1 micron with a narrow size distribution span (preferably 

less than about 2, especially about 1) and the 
concentration of the dispersed phase volume is between 

about 50% and 72%. The upper limit of the viscosity is 
dictated by the ability of the processing equipment to 

generate extension rate flows in the range of 10

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stable, viscous oil in water
emulsions and a process of preparing same that involves the
flow induced phase inversion of a water in oil emulsion
comprising a nonionic surfactant, a cationic or anionic
surfactant, and a viscous oil.An emulsion is a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids,
one being present in the other in the form of droplets.
The liquid contained in the droplets is called the
internal, discontinuous or dispersed phase while the liquid
surrounding the droplets is called the external or
continuous phase.Emulsions usually comprise water dispersed in oil (ie a w/o
emulsion) or oil dispersed in water (ie a o/w emulsion).
Both are inherently unstable and tend to cream (ie settle)
or coalesce unless a suitable emulsifier or emulsifying
agent is added to the emulsion to prevent this.The choice of emulsifier to stabilise a particular emulsion
is critical. The ionic nature, chemical type, the amount
used, and the hydrophile-lipophile balance of the
emulsifier must all be carefully considered.The hydrophile-lipophile balance or HLB is a number that
represents the relative simultaneous attraction of an
emulsifier for water and oil. It ranges from about 1 to
about 40 depending on the chemical composition and the
extent of ionisation of a given emulsifier. For example,
pure propylene glycol monostearate has a low HLB (ie 
strongly lipophilic); a polyoxyethylene monostearate
(H(OC2H4)nOOC(CH2)16CH3) having a long polyoxyethylene chain
has a high HLB (ie hydrophillic); and sodium stearate
(CH3(CH2)16COONa) has a very high HLB (ie strongly
hydrophillic), because it ionises and thus provides an even
stronger hydrophillic tendency.The viscosity or thickness of an emulsion is determined by
the characteristics of the external phase, which includes
any additives, the volume ratio of the two phases, particle
size and particle size distribution. The viscosity can be
increased by adding thickeners or gelling agents that are
compatible with the emulsifier, raising the proportion of
the internal phase, reducing the particle size or clumping
of existing particles or incorporating fine air particles
as a third phase.In general, the larger the size of the droplets that
comprise the internal phase, the more readily the emulsion
will tend to coalesce. Therefore it is desirable for the
globules or particles to be as small as practical. If the
particle size distribution is broad, the physical stability
of the emulsion is reduced. The particle size and particle
size distribution of the

said static mixer, to undergo a high extensional deformation

rate.

droplet size and the size distribution of the emulsion

droplets is minimized by superimposing an external energy
field, such as an ultrasound field, on the existing extensional deformation.
