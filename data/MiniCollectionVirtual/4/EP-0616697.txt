<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a set intended to display,
in convenient manner, a transparent sheet intended for
overhead projection.A display set is already known from the document WO-A-81/02639,
which comprises a substantially
rectangular transparent envelope adapted to receive the
transparent sheet, and retaining means - in this case
perforations - making it possible to retain the envelope
in a binder. A plurality of such sets can be collected
in the same binder, but in order to use them a speaker
must take out the desired envelope individually from the
binder in order to arrange it on the overhead projector,
which results in a handling operation which can be a
source of confusion.The document US-A-3,253,358 furthermore discloses a
binder for a plurality of transparent sheets which can be
placed on the glass of an overhead projector without
being detached from the binder. However, in addition to
the fact that this document does not relate to envelopes
but directly to bound transparencies, this form of
presentation does not permit the easy incorporation into
the binder of the notes which the speaker is to use,
enabling him at the same time to comment on the
transparency placed on the overhead projector and to see
what the next transparency will be. The object of the invention is to overcome the
disadvantages of the known devices and to provide a
display set which combines the convenience of the
envelopes known from the document WO-A-81/02639 with the
possibility of rational organization in the binder.The present invention is defined in claim 1.The object of the invention is achieved by a display
set for a transparent sheet intended for overhead
projection which comprises a substantially rectangular
transparent envelope adapted to received the transparent
sheet, retaining means making it possible to retain the
envelope in a binder, and a substantially rectangular backing
articulated to the envelope substantially along one of
its sides. The retaining means are situated on the edge
of the backing on the side opposite the first-mentioned
edge in order to retain the backing in the binder so that
the envelope can, as desired, be folded up onto the said
backing or unfolded in order to be placed on an overhead-projection
apparatus next to the binder.According to preferable features, the backing is
opaque, and at least one of its faces consists of a
material which accepts writing applied to it, where the
speaker's notes can be written.The retaining elements are preferably perforations.
The envelope preferably

A display set designed for
overhead projection of a transparency the display set comprising:


a substantially rectangular transparent envelope (10)
adapted to receive a transparency,
means (9) for retaining said envelope in a binder (3),

   characterized in that it further comprises a
substantially rectangular opaque back member (8) attached along

one of its sides to said envelope (10) for folding said
envelope (10) along said one side, and in that said retaining means (9)

is located on the edge of said opaque back member (8) at the
side opposite said one side for retaining said opaque back

member (8) in a binder (3) in such a way that said envelope
(10) can selectively be folded on said opaque back member (8) or

unfolded for placement on an overhead projector (1)
adjacent to a binder (3).
A set according to claim 1 characterized in
that said retaining means (9) are punched holes.
A set according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in
that said envelope (10) has an opaque flap (13) attached thereto

along its side opposite to the side to which
said opaque back member (8) is attached.
A set according to claim 1, 2 or 3 characterized in
that at least one face (8
a
) of said opaque back member (8) is made
from a material that accepts text written thereonto.
