<ABSTRACT>
A self-adhesive laminate that can be shaped on toenails and fingernails contains : (a) a film forming polymer layer containing at least one plasticizer; (b) a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer applied thereon and (c) a removable backing foil that covers the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer. The other side of the film forming polymer layer (a) is covered at least over its whole surface with an equally removable protective layer that is resistant to the remaining components of the laminate and to the materials used during production of the laminate. A process is also disclosed for producing said laminate, as well as its use as artificial nails to be applied on toenails or fingernails.
