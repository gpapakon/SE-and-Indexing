<ABSTRACT>
1. A clock generator contains a reference oscillator (10), a 
digital closed delay chain (12), a digital frequency divider 

(14) and a digital phase comparator (16). The frequency divider 
(14) is connected between the output of the adjustable delay 

chain (12) and one input of the phase comparator (16). The 
output of the reference oscillator (10) is connected to a 

further input of the phase comparator (16). Between the output 
of the phase comparator (16) and the delay chain (12) a digital 

up-down counter (18) is connected, the counting direction of 
which is determined by the output signal of the phase comparator 

(16) and by means of which the corresponding length of the delay 
chain (12) is adjustable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a clock generator of the kind as stated
in the preamble of Claim 1.With conventional clock generators a
voltage-controlled oscillator is provided as a rule as the
adjustable oscillator, a low-pass filter being additionally
connected between the voltage-controlled oscillator and the
phase comparator. In turn the output of the voltage-controlled
oscillator is fed back to an input of the phase comparator to
achieve a phase-locked loop (PLL).Of disadvantage in this respect is in particular the large
number of external components needed. In addition, the analog
functional units employed - such as phase detector, low-pass
filter and the voltage-controlled oscillator - have a relatively
complex configuration. In conclusion, the current consumption of
such an analog clock generator is also relatively high. A clock signals generator with digital components is known from EP-A-0
528 283. That clock signal generator is of the type defined in the preamble of
claim 1 and comprises a ring oscillator, a divider, a phase comparator, and an up-down
counter.In accordance with the present invention, a clock generator of the type
mentioned above is provided which further comprises the features of the
characterizing portion of claim 1. By means of such an interpolation logic it can be assured in
particular that changes in the length of the delay chain occur
within the same time frame.In one embodiment of the delay chain according to claim 2 the
corresponding length of the delay chain and thus the frequency
in each case can be adjusted by activating a corresponding loop
inverter which defines the inversion point in each case at which
the forward branch of the delay chain is directly connected with
the return branch thereof.Addressing the corresponding loop inverter is possible, for
example, via the control inputs as stated in claim 3, it being
good practice to undertake addressing so that only one loop
inverter of the delay chain is activated at any one time.Resetting the delay elements as defined by function, for
instance on power up, is ensured in particular by the delay
chain having preferably alternating delay elements of a first
kind, the outputs of which are logical 0 in the reset condition,
and delay elements of a second kind the outputs of which are
logical 1 in the reset condition. Accordingly all connecting
points of the delay chain can be reset, if required, to a
precisely defined initial status, the output of the selected
loop inverter assuming the correct value so that unwanted signal
