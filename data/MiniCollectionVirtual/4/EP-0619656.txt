<ABSTRACT>
A time division multiplex transmitting/receiving system converts a signal to be 
transmitted into a signal having a predetermined frequency at a predetermined time slot, 

which is transmitted as a transmission signal, and receives a transmitted signal having a 
frequency different from the frequency of the transmitted signal at another time slot 

different from the predetermined frequency, and for demodulating this received signal. 
The time division multiplex transmitting/receiving system includes a fixed oscillator 

(71), a variable oscillator (72), a mixer (73), a modulator (31), a converter (15), a 
frequency divider (75), and a demodulator (21). The fixed oscillator (71) outputs a first 

signal having a constant frequency. The variable oscillator (72) outputs a second signal 
having a predetermined frequency within a predetermined band range. The mixer (73) 

mixes the first signal with the second signal. The modulator (31) directly modulates a 
signal to be transmitted by employing the mixed signal. The converter (15) converts the 

received signal into the intermediate signal by employing the mixed signal. The 
frequency divider (75) frequency-divides the first signal outputted from the fixed 

oscillator. The demodulator (21) demodulates the intermediate frequency signal 
outputted from the converter with using the output from the frequency divider.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a time
division multiplex transmitting/receiving system. More
specifically, the present invention is directed to a time
division multiplex transmitting/receiving system in which
the transmitting frequency thereof is different from the
receiving frequency thereof, and the transmission and the
signal reception are switched for every predetermined time
slot.In the GSM (Group Special Mobile) corresponding to the
digital cellular system in Europe, as shown in Fig. 1, a
service area is subdivided into a plurality of regions "Ra"
to "Re". To the respective subdivided service regions,
exclusive-use frequencies "fa" to "fe" are allocated as
frequencies of transmission/reception signals. These
exclusive-use frequencies are determined in such a manner
that the frequencies of the adjoining regions must be
separated from each other as much as possible.As shown in Fig. 2(a), the frequencies "fa" to "fe" are
constituted by the transmission frequencies and the 
reception frequencies, and as the transmission (TX)
frequencies, the frequency band of a range from 890 MHz to
915 MHz is employed. This frequency band is subdivided
into 125 channels (CH) with a bandwidth of 200 KHz
respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the reception (RX)
frequencies are set to a frequency range from 935 MHz to 960
MHz. This frequency band is also subdivided into 125
channels with a bandwidth of 200 KHz, respectively.The GSM utilizes a so-called "frequency hopping" to
establish a privacy function. That is, the respective
channels are segmented into frames for every predetermined
time along the time axial direction, 4.616 ms in the GSM.
Considering a single mobile station, the channel
(frequencies) used by this mobile station is changed for
every frame. It should be noted that the
transmission/reception channels (frequencies) are selected
in such a manner that a difference between the transmission
channel frequency and the reception channel frequency and
the reception channel frequency is continuously 45 MHz.Each of the frames is subdivided into 8 time slots
(namely, a single time slot being 0.577 ms), as illustrated
in Fig. 3. Among these 8 time slots, a preselected one
time slot (namely, the head slot in the example of Fig. 3)
is determined as a reception (RX) time slot. Only a time
slot succeeded to this reception (RX) time slot by 3 time 
slots is used as a transmission (TX) time slot. A time
slot succeeded to this transmission (TX) time slot by either
two, or three time slots is used as a monitoring
