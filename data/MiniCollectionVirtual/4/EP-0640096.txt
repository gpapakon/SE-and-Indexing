<ABSTRACT>
A universal vaccine is disclosed which elicits a protective immune response in different host species and against different coronaviruses. A polypeptide which elicits protective antibodies against a homologous sequence found in the C terminal portion of coronavirus S proteins is disclosed. Vaccines comprising either the polypeptide or nucleic acids which encode the polypeptide are also disclosed. Methods of protecting a host against coronavirus infection are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Universal Coronavirus VaccineCross reference to related applicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. application serial number 07/882,171, filed May 8, 1992, pending, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application serial number 07/698,927, filed May 13, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application serial number 07/613,066, filed November 14, 1990, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.Field of the inventionThe present invention relates to a universal vaccine useful to protect different species of animals against infection by different host-specific coronaviruses.Background of the invention Coronaviruses are a family of host-specific enveloped RNA viruses with a single-stranded positive sense genome. Examples of coronaviruses include, but are not limited to: feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) which are specific to felines; canine coronavirus (CCV) which is specific to canines; transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) which is specific to swine; bovine coronavirus (BCV) which is specific to bovine species; human coronavirus which is specific to humans; mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which is specific to murine species; and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is specific to avian species. These host-specific coronaviruses cannot cross infect different species of animals. Viral infection of the host by a coronavirus can cause symptoms ranging from mild enteritis to severe debilating disease to, in some cases, death.Coronaviruses share common structural features including a spike or S protein (also referred to as a peplomer protein) . The S protein is a glycoprotein which protrudes 

from the surface of the virus particle. The S protein mediates the binding of virions to the host cell receptor and is involved in membrane fusion. In addition, it is the target of virus neutralizing antibodies. S proteins contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a C-terminal transmembrane segment and potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Comparison of different coronavirus S proteins show little homology, i.e. similarity, at the N terminus and highly conserved amino acid sequences at the C terminus. Because the tissue tropism and disease symptomatology is quite varied among this virus family, it is speculated that the pathogenesis of coronaviruses is determined by the sequences encoded at the N-terminus while the more conserved C-terminus encodes critical structural features common to all coronaviruses.
