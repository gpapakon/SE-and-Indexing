<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (1) for removing body hair is described, onto which apparatus there can be fitted alternatively a first attachment part (3) with an epilation cylinder (5) or a second attachment part (20) with a long-hair cutter (22). The attachment part (20) with the long-hair cutter (22) has a razor or upper blade (36) which can be driven via a gear and carries out an alternating back and forth movement in relation to a comb or lower blade (37).

<CLAIMS>
An appliance for the removal of human body
hairs, with a motor mounted in a casing (2) and two interchangeable

attachments attachable to and detachable
from the casing (2), namely a first attachment configured

as an epilation head, and a second attachment (20) having
means for depilation, 
characterized in that
 the epilation
head includes an epilating cylinder (5) for epilation

that can be rotated by the motor, and that the second
attachment (20) is configured as a cutting device for depilation,

said second attachment (20) accommodating a
gear arrangement (23) for driving the cutting device.
The appliance as claimed in claim 1,


characterized in that
 the transmission ratio of the gear
arrangement (23) is such that the oscillating frequency

of a blade disposed in the second attachment is about
three to seven times, in particular about five times, the

rotational frequency of the epilating cylinder (5).
An attachment having means for depilation for
use with an appliance for the removal of human body

hairs, with a motor carried in an appliance casing (2), a
driving gear (4), and two interchangeable attachments

attachable to and detachable from the casing (2), namely
a first attachment configured as an epilation head, and a

second attachment (20) having the means for depilation,

characterized in that
 the second attachment includes a
long-hair trimmer (22) and a gear arrangement (23)

integrated therein which is configured such as to be
drivable by the driving gear. 
The attachment as claimed in claim 3,

characterized in that
 the gear arrangement (23) has a
transmission ratio such that the oscillating frequency of

the blade is about three to seven times, in particular
about five times, the rotational frequency of an epilating

cylinder (5) provided in the first attachment.
The appliance or the attachment as claimed in
any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the long-hair trimmer (22) includes a blade, in particular
an outer cutter (36), which is adapted to be driven

by the gear arrangement (23) and performs a reciprocating
motion in alternate directions relative to a comb, in

particular a stationary inner cutter (37).
The appliance or the attachment as claimed in
any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the
long-hair trimmer (22) includes a blade, in particular an

inner cutter, which is adapted to be driven by the gear
arrangement (23) and performs a reciprocating motion in

alternate directions relative to a comb, in particular a
stationary outer cutter.
The appliance or the attachment as claimed in
any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the gear arrangement is configured as an angular gear
arrangement converting the rotary motion of a driving

gear (4) into an alternating motion of the blade.
The appliance or the attachment as claimed in
any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the gear arrangement (23) includes a crown gear (24)
adapted to be driven by the driving gear (4) and meshing

with a pinion (30) provided with an eccentrically
arranged engaging means (33) coupled to the blade (36). 
The appliance or the attachment as claimed in
any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the outer cutter (36) is configured in the manner of a
foil of a thickness of less than 0.2 mm, in particular

0.15 mm.
A method of removing body hairs, 
characterized
in that
 it first involves the step of placing a second
attachment (20) having a cutting device and a gear

arrangement onto a hair-removing appliance and performing
a depilating operation with said second attachment, and

that subsequently, after a period of some days, a first
attachment (3) having an epilating cylinder (5) is substituted

for said second attachment (20) and performs an
epilating operation.
The method as claimed in claim 10,

characterized in that
 the time interval between successive
uses of the second attachment (20) followed by the

first attachment (3) is between 3 to 12 days, approximately,
in particular about one week.
