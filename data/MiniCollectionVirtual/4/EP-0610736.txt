<ABSTRACT>
The invention proceeds from devices of the above type and endeavours to improve the efficiency of known devices and furthermore of those devices, the efficiency of which improves with the increasing speed of travel of the vehicle. In order to achieve this object, provision is made, according to the invention, for a heat exchanger (9) acted upon by the air slipstream and/or the intake air of the internal combustion engine (1), in which heat exchanger the exhaust gases are cooled to the dew point (condensation temperature) or a still lower temperature, the condensate produced being preferably neutralised in the device.
