<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a facing anchor for connecting the facing masonrywork (6) to the wall inner shell (4), the facing anchor being composed of an anchor wire (1) which can be fixed in the wall inner shell (4) and can be fixed at least in the facing masonrywork (6) by a settable binder (17). In order to permit connection to facing masonrywork (6) composed of perforated bricks, irrespective of the way in which the anchor wire (1) is fixed in the wall inner shell (4), a netting sleeve (8) is pushed on the part (2), located in the facing masonrywork (6), of the anchor wire (1), which netting sleeve is composed of a lattice sleeve (18) which is covered by a plastic sheath and exhibits a head part and a shank part (12, 10), the shank part (10) being closed off by a diaphragm (11).
