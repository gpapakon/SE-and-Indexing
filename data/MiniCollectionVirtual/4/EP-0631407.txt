<ABSTRACT>
The clock supply in large-scale systems with synchronous digital signal processing, for example in an SDH switching distributor, is designed as redundant in order to prevent operational system failure in the event of local failures or interruptions. The problem lies in completing the transition, without interference, from the defective clock pulse train to a different equivalent clock pulse train which has a different phase relation. A phase-locked loop generates the pulse train which is to be output. The phase shift is prevented by a changeover within the phase-locked loop, more precisely the control voltage of the PLL, in conjunction with a plurality of phase-shift compensation circuits (33, 34), one of which in each case constitutes the first part of the PLL. The phase-shift compensation circuit (33, 34) essentially comprises the phase discriminator of the PLL, supplemented by an adjustable delay and a correction voltage which can be readjusted. If the circuit is inserted in the PLL, the delay and the correction voltage remain set at the last determined value. The changeover is carried out in a virtually floating manner and essentially without phase change and without a transient effect. A frame insertion circuit (41) together with a frame monitor in the phase-shift compensation circuit enable the phase-exact processing of modulated clock pulse trains and open-circuit operation if all clock presettings fail.

A method for the phase-accurate switching-over of
similar pulse trains with different phase positions, of

which the respective selected pulse train determines, via a
phase locked loop, the pulse train which is to be output,


characterised in that
 each pulse train is individually
delayed and in this way the phase position relative to the

pulse train which is to be output is roughly adjusted to
zero, each non-selected pulse train is continuously

compared with the pulse train to be output, and the phase
error voltage corresponding to the phase difference still

present, which would act as control voltage in the phase
locked loop, is determined, an oppositely equal correcting

voltage is added thereto, and the sum - which is
substantially zero - is kept available as output voltage,

and that a switch-over to another pulse train takes place
in that the relevant correcting voltage is maintained at

the instantaneous value and the associated output voltage
is switched into the phase locked loop in place of the

previously used output voltage by way of control voltage.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the
synchronising marks present in the similar pulse trains are

inserted into the pulse train which is to be output.
A method according to Claim 2, wherein the comparison
of the pulse trains includes the synchronising marks which

are present, so that phase shifts of more than one pulse
width can also be determined and correctly compensated.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 upon the failure of all the similar pulse trains, the
control voltage is switched to zero, so that the pulse

train to be output is further generated with a frequency
differing unsubstantially from the last used frequency. 
A method according to Claim 4, wherein an accompanying
counter generates the synchronising marks which are

inserted into the pulse train to be output.
A device for the phase-accurate switching-over of
similar pulse trains with different phase positions, of

which the respective selected pulse train determines, via a
phase locked loop, the pulse train which is to be output,


characterised in that
 for each of the similar pulse trains
a phase shift adjustment circuit (33, 34) is provided, with

an input (31, 32) for the respective similar pulse train, a
further input (35) for the output pulse train, and an

output (37, 38) for the output voltage (Ua), and that an
electronic change-over switch (36) is provided at the

outputs (37, 38) of the phase shift adjustment circuits
(33, 34), for selectively switching one of these into the

phase locked loop.
A device according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that

the phase shift adjustment circuit (33, 34) substantially
contains a discretely adjustable delay line (51-52) for the

similar pulse train, a phase discriminator (56) commonly
used for phase locked loops which supplies a phase error

voltage (Ud) dependent upon the phase between the delayed
pulse train and the output pulse train, and a trackable

voltage source (59-58-50-55) which at the output (37)
superimposes upon the phase error voltage (Ud) a correcting

voltage (Us) which compensates the phase error voltage (Ud)
for such time as the phase shift adjustment circuit (33,

34) is not switched into the phase locked loop by the

electronic change-over switch (36) and which is maintained
at the last set value when the phase shift adjustment

circuit (33, 34) is switched into the phase locked loop.
A device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that

the discretely adjustable delay line (51-52) is tapped via 
a multiplexer circuit (52) which is set automatically on

the basis of the phase comparison such that the smallest
possible phase shift results, and which is maintained at

the last set value when the phase shift adjustment circuit
(33, 34) is switched into the phase locked loop.
A device according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that

the phase locked loop comprises a frame insertion circuit
(41) which substantially contains a counter, in accordance

with the count of which synchronising marks are inserted
into the pulse train to be output, so that even upon the

failure of all the similar pulse trains a complete pulse
train to be output is generated.
A device according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that

the frame insertion circuit (41) is connected to each phase
shift adjustment circuit (33, 34) via a control line (46)

via which synchronising signals are exchanged, and that the
phase shift adjustment circuit (33, 34) contains a frame

monitor (57) so that the frame insertion circuit (41) is
synchronised to the frame clock.
