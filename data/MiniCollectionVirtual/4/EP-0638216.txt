<ABSTRACT>
An SDH cross connect architecture is realized by switching the signals as bits in the space switch. The bit signals between the space switch and the time switches are multiplexed. In this way it is possible to linearly expand the capacity of the space switch to a much larger size before its quadratic expansion begins. The invention is applicable for the cross-connection of SDH signals on i.a. STM-1... STM-16 levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a method according to the preamble
of claim 1 for the cross-connection of SDH signals. The invention
also relates to a cross-connection architecture for implementing
the method.The synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) comprises quite a large
entity to be very far advanced in order to transmit time division
signals in the telecommunication network. The recommendation
CCITT G.707 defines the signals of the first level synchronous
transport module (STM-1) for SDH signals having a transmission
rate of 155.520 Mbit/s. Other defined levels are STM-4 (633.080
Mbit/s) and STM-16 (2.488.320 Mbit/s). Higher levels are under
study. The recommendations CCITT G.708 specify the STM-N (where
N = 1, 4, 16) frame structure. The basic STM-1 frame is composed
of bytes (8 bits), of which there are 2430 including the control
blocks; then an STM-1 frame transmits 63 subsystem containers
(e.g. TU-1, Tributary Unit, which can contain a 2 Mbit/s signal
of a common 30 channel PCM system). The STM-1 frames are repeated
8000 times each second, which is the same as in the subsystem;
thus each byte of a frame forms a 64 kbit/s channel. The STM-N
frames are combined into logical multiframes. The SDH signals
or transport modules are formed by interleaving the bytes of the
subsystem signals.The concept of the digital cross connect was developed in order
to ensure a flexible growth of the telecommunications networks
and to ensure more developed traffic control modes. Cross connect
systems (SDH)DXC (Digital Cross Connect, CCITT draft recommendations
G.sdxc-1...-3) are also under development for the
synchronous digital hierarchy. The SDH DXC is defined (informally
abbreviated): 'A digital SDH cross connect is a cross connect
device having two or more interfaces at SDH rates (G.707) and
being at least able to terminate a transmission section and to 
controllable, transparently connect and reconnect virtual
containers (VC) between the interface ports'.An SDH DXC can transmit traffic between different SDH levels and
connect traffic between different signals. The use of the cross
connect also includes a possibility for remote control of
routing, initialization of reserve routes, connection from one
signal to several signals (broadcasting), and so on. The
connections are usually bothway connections.The mentioned CCITT SDH recommendations try to define the logical
function, i.e. a functional structure of devices, but they avoid
the detailed structural description of the devices.The digital cross connect has already
