<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to materials and methods
for extraction of antigens from microorganisms.Several techniques for extraction of antigens from
microorganisms are well known to those skilled in the art.
Cellular antigens such as carbohydrates, proteins,
lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, polysaccharides,
nucleic acids, carbohydrates complexed with proteins,
lipids, and others have been extracted by a variety of
chemical or mechanical means. Such extraction techniques
include boiling, autoclaving, detergent extraction, acid
extraction, digestion with hot formamide, nitrous acid
extraction, sonication or other mechanical disruption,
phenol/chloroform extraction, or digestion by enzymes. If
an antigen is to be used in an immunological assay it is
important that the extraction protocol preserve the
binding characteristics of that antigen.Nitrous acid is a chemical extraction technique
(Manual of Clinical Microbiology, Third Edition, Edwin H.
Lennette, Albert Balows, William J. Havsler, Jr., and
Joseph P. Traunt, Editors, American Society for Microbiology,
Washington, DC (1980)). The method, traditionally,
involves mixing two liquid reagents, an acid and a nitrite
salt solution. This mixture generates a nitrous acid
intermediate in solution. This nitrous solution is
generally neutralized prior to subsequent steps. Assay
kits based on this method include three separate reagent
bottles designed to deliver a pre-determined volume, i.e.,
a number of drops, of each reagent to a sample tube.Variations of this technique have been described. For
example, Sand et al. (patent application, WO93/15217), 
describes an extraction of Group A or B Streptococci with
two dried and one liquid reagent. The sodium nitrite and
Tris base are dried onto separate filter pads and an
excess volume of acetic acid is added to reconstitute
first the NaNO2, and then (after an extraction period) the
Tris base which neutralizes the solution.U.S. Patent, 4,851,337, describes another modification
of the nitrous acid extraction protocol in which one
vessel contains a polymeric acid and one contains a
nitrite solution. While not reducing the number of
reagents, this method provides pre-measured solutions that
can be quickly mixed to allow antigen extraction. The
end-user is not required to measure a specified number of
reagent drops to the sample tube. In this method, the
nitrite solution is transferred to a tube containing dried
polymeric acid, mixed, and a sample swab added. After an
incubation period, the solution is neutralized by
