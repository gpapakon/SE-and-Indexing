<ABSTRACT>
A technique for displaying the results of a query on a database. The 
technique associates a subquery of the query with a space in a display and represents 

the results of the subquery by means of a symbol whose appearance varies with a 
characteristic of the results of the subquery. In a preferred embodiment, the 

technique is used with queries on a data base of statistical articles. The display is a 
grid with each field of the grid representing a journal-year pair. A symbol appears 

in the field if a search of the data base results in a minimum number of hits in the 
year and journal represented by the pair. The appearance of the symbol varies with 

properties such as the number of hits and the number of pages in the hits. Bar graphs 
along the sides of the grid indicate total numbers of hits per journal and year. The 

symbol for a given journal-year pair changes its color when the pointer is moved 
over it, and if a mouse button is depressed when the pointer is over the symbol, the 

data base references for the hits corresponding to the journal-year pair are displayed 
in an article view window. Sliders control the number of hits required for the 

display of a symbol and the size of the symbols. The implementation employs 
memory mapping and caching techniques to achieve rapid generation of a display 

from the results of a search.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns graphical displays in computer systems in general 
and graphical displays of the results of queries in particular. As computers have become cheaper and more powerful, interactive data base 
systems have become widely available. Users in many different areas of endeavor 
employ interactive data base systems to find items of information in a 
large collection of information. A user of an interactive data base system provides 
the data base system with a query which the user believes will describe 
the items of information being sought. The data base system then responds 
to the query by returning a result which includes all of the information in the 
data base system which satisfies the query. The result generally also includes 
a value which indicates the number of hits, that is, the number of items of 
data which satisfy the query. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example interactive data base system 101. 
The system includes terminal 103, which provides output to and receives  
 
input from the user, processor 113, which performs the actual searching operations, 
and memory system 115, which contains programs 119 executed by 
processor 113 and data base 117 which contains the data. In more detail, 
terminal 103 includes a display screen 105, upon which processor 113 displays 
information for the user. Display screen 105 also includes pointer 107, which 
specifies a location in display 105 and may be moved under control of either 
keyboard 109 or mouse 111. The user controls the operation of system 101 by 
inputs from keyboard 109 and/or mouse 111. Processor 113 may be any kind 
of processor, from a personal computer through a supercomputer. Memory 
system 115, finally, includes any data accessible to system 101, and may thus 
include random-access memory, a file system on magnetic or optical disk, 
or even remotely-located data bases. When employing system 101 to find 
information in data base 117, the user inputs a query using keyboard 109 or 
mouse 111; processor 113 executes programs 119 as required to perform the 
query on data base 117 and returns the number of hits and the results to 
display screen 105. The user can then use keyboard 109 and/or mouse 111 
to examine the results in more detail. The usefulness of interactive data base systems like system 101 is attested 
to by their popularity; present systems do, however, have their limitations. 
A recurring source of frustration among users of interactive data base systems 
is that the systems always seem to return either

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for showing the results of a query on a data base, the 
apparatus comprising: 

   a set of areas in a display, each area corresponding to a subquery of the 
query; and
