<ABSTRACT>
In a pipette device, a suction device applies 
suction to a pipette tip to draw liquid into the 

pipette tip. A porous plastic plug is mounted in the 
pipette tip to prevent contamination of the suction 

device by the liquid sample. The median pore size in 
the porous plastic plug ranges from 3 microns to an 

upper limit which varies with the hydrophobicity of 
the material of the plug.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pipette devices of the 
type having a suction device for drawing liquid, such 
as blood serum, into a pipette and expelling the 
liquid from the pipette and more particularly to a 
pipette device designed to prevent contamination of 
the suction device by aerosols or overpipetting. Pipettes are standard laboratory apparatus used 
to transfer liquids from one vessel to another, or to 
a slide, or to other sample receiving medium. A 
pipette is basically a hollow tubular vessel open at 
both ends and the liquid to be transported is drawn 
into the tubular vessel by applying suction to the 
upper end. The liquid inside the vessel is forced out 
by the application of positive air pressure to the 
upper end of the vessel. Thus, in operation, liquid 
is first sucked into the vessel and then blown out of 
the vessel. For many years, the suction was applied 
to a pipette by mouth. This method has largely been 
abandoned because of health concerns. In modern 
pipette devices, the suction is applied by a flexible 
bulb or by a piston moving in a cylinder or a hand-held 
vacuum gun that uses a small vacuum pump to suck 
the fluid into the pipette. Dispensing from the 
pipette is generally achieved by reversal of the 
action that created the suction.  
 A pipette device is known (US-A-3 748 909) having a tubular 
tip defining a sample reservoir to receive a sample, a porous 
plastic plug mounted above said tubular tip and above said reservoir, 
means to apply suction to the upper end of said tubular tip to 
draw air through said porous plastic plug and a liquid sample 
into said reservoir, said suction means including means to 
control the amount of the sample drawn into said reservoir to 
a precisely selected volume, wherein the medium pore size in 
said porous plastic plug in the preferred embodiment is in 
minimum .2 microns. This, however, is much too small in order 
to achieve accurate control of the volume of the pipetted 
liquid due to air leakage into the chamber above the porous 
plastic plug. It is tought (US-A-2 634 028, esp. col. 2, line 20 to col. 3, 
line 30) that the maximum pore size of a barrier plug in a 
suction device operating on mercury could be calculated 
according to the "wettability" of the plug by mercury being 
pipetted in order to ensure that liquid will not be able to 
flow through the barrier when subjected to normal operating 
pressures. However, the formula as disclosed cannot provide a 
correct result, because it is based on the wrong assumption 
that the
