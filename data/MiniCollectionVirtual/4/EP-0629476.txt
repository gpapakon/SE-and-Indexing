<ABSTRACT>
The machine has a conveying path (2) on which work pieces (3) are conveyed by conveying rollers (5). Located in the region above the conveying path (2) is a spindle (14) on which a working tool (15) for the work piece (3) is seated. The series of conveying rollers (5) is interrupted in the region of this spindle (14). Situated between the conveying roller (5), located in front of and behind the spindle (14) in the conveying direction (4) of the work pieces (3), and the spindle (14) is in each case an additional roller (17, 18) having a smaller diameter than these conveying rollers (5). The smallest work-piece length can thus correspond to the spacing of the axles of these additional rollers (17, 18), which is smaller than the spacing between the conveying rollers (5) situated in front of and behind these additional rollers. As a result, it is possible to work even very short work pieces (3) in a continuous pass through the machine.

A machine for working workpieces (3) of wood, plastics material and the like, with at 
least one conveyor path (2), on which the workpieces (3) can be conveyed by conveying 

rollers (5) which are arranged in a line in succession and which rest upon the workpieces 
(3), and with a spindle (14) situated in the region above the conveyor path (2) for a 

machining tool (15, 15a), preferably a cutter head, which is covered by a hood (16, 16a) 
interrupting the line of the conveying rollers (5), 
characterized in that
 at least one 
driven additional roller (17, 18; 17a, 18a) is arranged respectively between the conveying 

roller (5) - situated in front of and behind the spindle (14) in the conveying direction (4) 
of the workpieces (3) - and the spindle (14) in each case, the said additional rollers (17, 

18; 17a, 18a) having a smaller diameter than the said conveying rollers (5) and enabling 
workpieces (3) to be conveyed, the length of which is smaller than the distance between 

the axes of the conveying rollers (5) situated in front of and behind the spindle (14). 
A machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the additional rollers (17, 18; 
17a, 18a) have a common drive with the conveying rollers (5). 
A machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the distance (19) between 
the axes of rotation of the additional rollers (17, 18; 17a, 18a) is only slightly larger than 

the working diameter of the machining tool (15). 
A machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the additional 
rollers (17, 18; 17a, 18a) are vertically adjustable. 
A machine according to Claim 4

characterized in that
 the additional 
rollers (17, 18; 17a, 18a) are mounted on shafts (24, 25) which are arranged transversely 

to the conveying direction (4) and which project from transmission housings (22, 23; 
22a, 23a) in each of which one respective transmission gear is arranged. 
A machine according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 one respective adjustment 

device (29, 30; 29a, 30a) engages on each transmission housing (22, 23; 22a, 23a).  
 
A machine according to one of Claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that
 one adjustment 
device (29) has a threaded spindle (31) which is articulated to a transmission housing 

(22) and on which a nut (34) provided with a handle (33) is mounted. 
A machine according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the other adjustment 
device (30) has an operating cylinder (35) of which the piston rod (36) is articulated to 

the other transmission housing (23). 
A machine according to one of Claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that
