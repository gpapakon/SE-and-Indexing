<ABSTRACT>
Use of a Cu-Ti-X alloy to mfr. wires or profiles for parts of spectacles is claimed. The alloy comprises 2.0-3.5% Ti, X= 0.1-1.0% Fe, or 0.05-0.5% Zr, or 0.5-1.5% Mg, a balance of Cu and usual impurities. The vacuum-cast and extruded alloy has a hardness of at least 200 HV10 after cold forming; homogenising annealing between 850-1000 deg C for 10 mins.-10hrs. rapid cooling at 20 deg C/S-150 deg C/s, and cold forming between 50 and 90% degree of forming. Amt. of Fe present is 0.3-0.6%, Zr is 0.1-0.5% and Mg is 0.8-1.2%. Subsequent cold forming of at least 20% is carried out.

<CLAIMS>
The use of a copper-titanium-X alloy, consisting of

from 2.0 to 3.5 % by weight titanium,
X = from 0.1 to 1.0 % by weight iron or
X = from 0.05 to 0.5 % by weight zirconium or
X = from 0.5 to 1.5 % by weight magnesium,

the remainder copper and customary impurities,

wherein the vacuum-cast and extruded alloy has, after cold-working,
homogenising annealing at from 850 t
o 1000°C (from 10
minutes to 10 hours), rapid cooling at a cooling rate in the

range of from 20°C/second to 150°C/second, and cold-working to
from 50 % to 90 % strain, a hardness of at least 200 HV10,

for the manufacture of wires and shaped pieces for spectacle
parts.
The use of a copper alloy according to claim 1 comprising
from 0.3 to 0.6 % by weight iron for the purpose according to

claim 1.
The use of a copper alloy according to claim 1 comprising
from 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight zirconium for the purpose

according to claim 1. 
The use of a copper alloy according to claim 1 comprising
from 0.8 to 1.2 % by weight magnesium for the purpose

according to claim 1.
The use of a copper alloy according to one or more of
claims 1 to 4 that has undergone final cold-working of at

least 20 % for the purpose according to claim 1.
