<ABSTRACT>
A textile floor covering consists of a base fabric (2), composed of natural fibres, and a wool pile (1), tufted into the base fabric (2). The foot (1a) of the tufted wool pile (1) has been adhesively bonded to the base fabric (2) by means of a natural latex film (3). All the parts of the carpet including the adhesive coating (3) are biodegradable materials. After use, the carpet can therefore be disposed of by simply composting it.

A textile carpeting made of a substrate fabric formed by a 
weft and warp of natural fibres into which a yarn is tufted, and 

the backing of the substrate fabric is covered by a bonding 
adhesive layer for stabilizing the fabric and fixing the yarn in 

position, whereto a second backing is attached, 
characterized in 
that
 all constituents of the carpeting consist of biologically 
degradable materials and the adhesive layer (3) is a film of 

natural latex. 
A carpeting according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
adhesive layer (3) is exclusively preserved by inorganic substances, 

preferably potassium hydroxide. 
A carpeting according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
substrate fabric (2) consists of linen and/or cotton and/or 

jute. 
A carpeting according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
yarn (1) consists of pure new wool. 
A carpeting according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 a 
coloured new wool is only treated with colour dyes produced from 

plants or animals and/or acid dyes admissible for foods. 
A carpeting according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the adhesive layer (3) is provided as a thicker layer of 
the latex compound (4) of natural latex with mineral additives 

for fixing the second backing (5, 6) in position. 
A carpeting according to claim 5 or 7, 
characterized in 
that
 the second backing (5, 6) is formed of jute or consists of 
a woollen fleece (6) with a substrate fabric (5) of cotton.  

 
A carpeting according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterized in that
 the auxiliary agents applied during the 
manufacture of the carpeting to its constituents are free of 

ethoxylated substances, short-chain aldehydes, heavy metals and 
halides.
