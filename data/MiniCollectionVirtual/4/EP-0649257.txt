<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for transmitting a digital television signal which 
provides audio, video and data packets alternating with training signals. In order to 

minimize interference to other systems which could occur due to the periodicity of the 
training signal, randomly selected training signals are inverted prior to combining them 

with the data packets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a transmission system using training sequence 
portions periodically interleaved with data portions. The invention is also related to a 
transmitter and a transmission method for training sequence portions periodically 
interleaved with data portions. Such system is described in European patent application No. 94201227.9 
filed at May, 3, 1994 (Japanese Patent Application No. 94-93557, filed at May, 2, 
1994) Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and cable television testing 
organizations such as Cable Labs, have been evaluating digital television delivery 
systems in order to choose a new television "standard" which someday will replace 
NTSC in the United States. These systems all involve digital coding and data 
compression techniques, for example those utilizing the MPEG algorithm or variations 
thereof. Such systems utilize other digital compression schemes, for example 
MUSICAM, to digitally code audio. The aforementioned patent application describes a method and apparatus 
for providing a single carrier QAM television signal which emulates the reception 
characteristics exhibited by audio and video in conventional analog television systems by 
using multiresolution signal constellations or by time-division multiplexing different 
constellations to prioritize the transmission of portions of a television signal. In digital data transmission systems information is coded into data bits and 
a modem transmitter encodes groups of bits into symbols for transmission at a 
prescribed signalling rate. The analog transmission channels usually introduce linear 
amplitude and phase distortion to the transmitted signal as well as multipath. This 
distortion can cause an overlap of received symbols known as intersymbol interference 
(ISI). Such distortion can be compensated for by using an adaptive digital equalizer in 
the modem receiver to eliminate ISI caused by channel impairments. These equalizers 
require rapid, accurate and dependable estimation of the characteristics of the 
transmission channel in order to provide for fast start-up equalization. As described in  
 
the above mentioned patent application training sequences are embedded in the data 
stream to achieve the periodic equalization. The aforementioned patent application describes a data stream which 
comprises, in addition to a main header packet comprising a "long" training sequence, 
additional headers each comprising "short" training sequences. The addition of a "short" training sequence is useful for example,
