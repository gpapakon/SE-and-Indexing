<ABSTRACT>
In a furnace which essentially consists of a combustion chamber (11) with a pre-mixing burner (200), means (300) which consist of individual injector nozzles are used to form combustion air (15, 16) consisting of fresh air (19) and flue gas (20). These injector nozzles are located outside the interior space of the pre-mixing burner (200) but are placed in the inflow of the fresh air (19) to the interior space. The injector nozzles through which fresh air flows develop a suction effect relative to the flue gases (20) to form the combustion air (15, 16) for operating the pre-mixing burner (200).

<CLAIMS>
Firing installation, consisting of a combustion
space (11), a premixing burner (200) and means for

forming combustion air (15, 16) consisting of fresh air
(19) and combustion gas (20), the premixing burner

consisting, in the flow direction, of at least two
hollow partial bodies (1, 2) positioned one upon the

other, whose centre lines (1b, 2b) extend offset
relative to one another in the longitudinal direction

of the partial bodies so that, thereby, an axial inlet
flow cross-section and tangential inlet slots (21, 22)

appear for the supply of the combustion air into the
internal space (14) of the premixing burner, and it

being possible to operate the premixing burner with at
least one fuel nozzle (3, 17), characterized in that

the means for forming the combustion air consist of
individual injector nozzles (29a, 29b, 29c), in that

the injector nozzles (29a, 29b, 29c) are placed
upstream of the tangential inlet slots in the axial

inlet flow cross-section (18) and in the flow direction
of the combustion air (15) such that all the inlet

openings of the fresh air (19) before the formation of
its mixture with the combustion gas (20) are provided,

in the flow direction towards the internal space of the
premixing burner, with a tight network of injectors

(29a, 29b, 29c).
Firing installation according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the premixing burner (200) is

provided with at least one fuel nozzle (3) placed at
the front end and/or is provided with a number of fuel

nozzles (17) arranged in the region of the tangential
inlet slots (21, 22).
Firing installation according to Claim 2,
characterized in that a liquid fuel (12) can be

supplied through the fuel nozzle (3) and a gaseous fuel
(13) can be supplied through the of fuel nozzles (17).
Firing installation according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the partial bodies (1, 2) have a 

uniformly increasing flow cross-section in the flow
direction.
Firing installation according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the partial bodies (1, 2) have an

unevenly increasing flow cross-section in the flow
direction.
Firing installation according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the partial bodies (1, 2) have a

decreasing flow cross-section in the flow direction.
Method for operating a firing installation
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the

combustion gases (20) for the formation of the
combustion air (15, 16) are induced directly from the

combustion space (11) of the firing installation by the
suction effect of the injector nozzles (29a, 29b, 29c)

through which fresh air flows.
