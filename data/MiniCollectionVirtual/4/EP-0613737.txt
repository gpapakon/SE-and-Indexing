<ABSTRACT>
A roll arrangement has a controlled deflection roll (1) and a mating roll (2). The controlled deflection roll has a shell (4) which is supported on a support (7) by means of a hydrostatic supporting device (5). The ends (9) of the shell are each supported on a bearing ring (14) which is guided in radially displaceable fashion in the plane of action and can be loaded in the direction of displacement by a force (F). The ends (9) of the shell can each furthermore be loaded by a torque (M) which has an axis perpendicular to the plane of action. It is thereby possible to match the deflection of the shell better to the deflection of the mating roll.

<CLAIMS>
Roller assembly with a deflection-equalising roller (1) 
and a counter roller (2) forming with it a pressing gap 

(3), wherein in combination there is provided: 

a) the deflection-equalising roller (1) comprises a 
radially displaceable sleeve (4) which by means of a 

hydrostatic supporting device (5) is supported on a 
support (7) which passes through the sleeve and is 

mounted non-rotatably at both its ends and of which 
the sleeve ends (9) are each mounted on a bearing ring 

(14) which is guided radially displaceably in the 
working plane, 
b) the bearing ring (14) can be loaded by force 
generators (18, 18a; 38) in the direction of displacement, 
c) the sleeve ends (9) can each be loaded by a torque 
generator (25) which, by exerting a pressure on one or 

two flanges (23, 24) attached to the sleeve end, 
generates a torque (M) about an axis perpendicular to 

the working plane (E), and 
d) a control device (32) is provided at each sleeve end 
(9) for independently or proportionally adjusting the 

resulting force (F) of the force generators (18, 18a; 
38) and the resulting torque (M) of the torque 

generators (25). 
Roller assembly according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the control device (32) adjusts the force (F) and the 

torque (M) as a function of the width of the web to be 
treated. 
Roller assembly according to either of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the control device (32) adjusts the 

force (F) and the torque (M) as a function of the mean line 
force in the pressing gap (3).  

 
Roller assembly according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the force generators (18, 18a; 38) 

comprise piston and cylinder units which act between 
support (7) and bearing ring (14). 
Roller assembly according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that cylinder and pressure chambers are 

supplied via fluid supply pipes (33-35; 35a; 41, 42) in the 
support. 
Roller assembly according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a force generator (18) is provided on 

the side of the bearing ring (14) facing away from the 
pressing gap (3). 
Roller assembly according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that a force generator (18a) is provided 

on the side of the bearing ring (14) facing towards the 
pressing gap (3).
