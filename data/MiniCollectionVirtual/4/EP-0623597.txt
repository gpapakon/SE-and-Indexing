<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel pyridine 
derivatives useful as medicines, a method of producing 
them and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The novel pyridine derivatives of this invention 
have smooth muscle relaxation activities, coronary 
blood flow increasing activities and antihypertensive 
activities, and have therapeutic and prophylactic 
effects against, for example, circulatory diseases such 
as angina pectoris, cardiac infarction, cardiac 
insufficiency, arrhythmia and hypertension; respiratory 
diseases such as asthma; cerebral diseases such as 
cerebrovascular contraction, apoplectic stroke and 
epilepsy; enuresis; peptic ulcer; hypersensitive 
intestinal disturbances; and alopecia. Recently, drugs of a new type called a potassium 
channel opener exhibiting smooth muscle relaxation 
activities by opening (activating) the potassium 
channel have attracted attention. For example, 
chroman-3-ol derivatives which have the potassium 
channel opening (activating )activity and exhibit 
antihypertensive activity on spontaneous hypertensive 
rats are disclosed in JPA S58(1983)-67683 corresponding 
to EPA 76075, J. Med. Chem., 29, pp. 2194-2201 (1986) 
and Br. J. Pharmac. 88, pp. 103-111 (1986). In USP 
4057636, cyanoguanidine derivatives having 
antihypertensive activities is disclosed. However, 2-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)pyridine 
derivatives having potassium 
channel opening activities have not been known yet. And, benzoyl pyridine O-substituted oxime 
derivatives are disclosed in JPA S55(1980)-19288 
corresponding to EPA 7679, JPA H2(1990)-115166 
corresponding to EPA 366006 and JPA H4(1992)-99767. In JPA S55(1980)-19288, there is disclosed a 
compound having the activity of suppressing ulcer,  
 
which is represented by the formula 
 
wherein Het stands for 2-, 3- or 4-pyridinyl group 
which is, in some cases, substituted with one or more 
of a halogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group or a C1-6 alkoxy 
group; Ar stands for phenyl group or 5- or 6-membered 
monocyclic heterocyclic group which are, in some cases, 
substituted with a halogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, a 
C1-6 alkoxy group, trifluoromethyl group or 
hydroxymethyl group; R stands for a C1-3 alkyl group; 
and m and n each denotes 0 or 1, provided that, in no 
case, 
m+n=2, 
or its N-oxide or its pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts. In JPA H2(1990)-115166, there is disclosed a 
compound having the calmodulin-antagonistic activity, 
which is represented by the formula 
 
wherein Ar stands for an optionally substituted 
aromatic cyclic group
