<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a clutch for a mirror 
particularly for commercial vehicles, which enables the 

mirror to be mounted on an arm projecting away from the 
vehicle, and which can be folded close to the vehicle 

when it is necessary to reduce width for negotiating 
narrow gateways and the like. As shown in Figure 1, the 

mirror arm (18) is provided with teeth (28) which are engaged 
in recesses (24) in an intermediate member and which is 

itself keyed by means of teeth (26) to recesses (22) in a 
bracket to be fixed to the vehicle cab. The intermediate 

member is urged via a spring (12) via a spring follower (14). 
The parts are mounted on a common pivot pin, not shown, 

which fixes the axial position of the arm (18) relative to 
the bracket (10) since all of the clutch operation is 

effected by movement of the intermediate member (16) by the 
spring, or against the spring (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates primarily to mirror mechanisms for commercial
vehicles.The usual arrangement includes a D member having a pair of parallel
portions extending outwardly from the vehicle cab and which are integral and
unitary with a vertically extending portion spaced from the cab. The mirror
head, that is the reflective element in its casing, is clamped to the vertical
portion. When the vehicle negotiates a narrow passage the D member can be
folded from its normal outward position to one close to the cab so as to reduce
the total width. For this purpose the cab ends of the parallel portions are
pivoted coaxially on mounting brackets attached to the cab. To enable the D
member to be returned to the precise position formerly occupied, and
furthermore to resist movement out of that normal position under wind
pressure, a so-called clutch mechanism is employed in (usually) one only of
the brackets. The D member portion which is so pivoted is herein called "the
arm" when a predetermined force ("the break out force") is applied, sufficient
to overcome springloading. This causes an axial separation of the parts for
example as a dogtooth on one part moves out of a recess on the other part.
This is accommodated by flexing of the arm. The resilience of the arm assists
in re-engagement, and represents part of the total springloading which normally
holds the tooth in the recess and hence fixes the angular position of the
respective parts.It is also to be mentioned that in some cases the D member may consist
only of the arm, that is the second parallel portion and even the vertical
portion may be eliminated. In this case the arm does not contribute to the
springloading, but essentially the same clutch mechanism is employed. US-A-4 186 905 shows the arm connectable to the bracket via an
intermediate member which is axially movable relative to the bracket but
angularly fast therewith by means of teeth and recesses, and also having teeth
as recesses operable between the intermediate member and the arm.The main problem now is that cab widths are increasing, and in order
to avoid undue increase in total 
vehicle width, shorter arms are employed. In the extreme case, the arm forms
the vertical portion only without any transversely extending portion. In either
case or where extended axial movement cannot be permitted - that is a shorter
transverse portion or none at all, the possibility of relying on flexibility of the
arm is reduced or lost.The object of the invention is to provide a clutch mechanism which
avoids the

<CLAIMS>
A mirror mechanism comprising a bracket (10), an arm (18) pivoted to
the bracket for angular movement, and a clutch mechanism (12,14,16) for

normally holding the arm in a predetermined position relative to the bracket,
in which the clutch mechanism comprises an intermediate member (16) which

is axially movable relative to the bracket but is angularly fast relative to the
bracket by the provision of radial teeth (26) on the intermediate member

engageable in recesses (22) in the bracket or vice versa, said intermediate
member also having teeth (24) cooperable with recesses (28) on the arm or

vice versa so as to hold the arm angularly fast to the intermediate member, and
spring means (12) for urging the intermediate member into engagement of the

recesses, characterised in that said intermediate member is radially slit (26) or
is a ring of segments so as to allow limited radial movement when the spring

means act on the intermediate member.
A mirror as claimed in Claim 1 wherein a spring follower (14) of
generally frusto-conical shape is located between the spring and the

intermediate member.
A mirror as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the teeth (28) and
recesses (24) are tapered or of wedge shape.
A mirror as claimed in claim 1 wherein each tooth (26) comprises parts
provided on separate segments of the intermediate member.
A mirror as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 wherein the tooth shape
relative to the recess shape allows the tooth to be driven for a variable distance

so as to allow for wear.
