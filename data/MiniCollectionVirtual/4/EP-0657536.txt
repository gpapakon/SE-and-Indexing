<ABSTRACT>
Molecules which influence the shedding of the 
cell-bound p55 Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor 

(p55-TNF-R), are provided, together with methods 
of producing them. 
More particularly, the invention relates to proteases which cleave 
the cell-bound p55 TNF-R thus creating the soluble receptor and to 

inhibitors to these proteases comprising sequence asn-172 to thr-182 of 
p55-TNF-R or muteins thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to molecules which
influence shedding of the cell-bound p55 Tumor Necrosis
Factor receptor (p55 TNF-R), and to their preparation.
More particularly, the invention relates to inhibitors
of a protease which cleave the cell-bound p55 TNF-R thus
creating the soluble receptor and to their use.It is known that many cell-surface proteins occur also in
soluble forms. Some of these soluble molecules are
created as such in vivo from distinct mRNAs, transcribed
by alternative splicing mechanisms from the same genes
which encode the cell-surface proteins. Others are
derived from the cell-surface proteins presumably by
proteolytic cleavage or, in the case of lipid anchored
proteins, by the cleavage of their lipid anchor. Shedding
of cell-surface proteins may occur spontaneously and, for
example cancer cells seem to have a propensity for doing
so. Shedding may also be induced by various stimulating
agents.Knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the shedding of
cell-surface proteins and in its regulation is quite
limited. None of the proteases or lipases taking part in
it have so far been identified. There is also no clear
indication of the subcellular site at which it occurs -
on the cell surface or within some other intracellular
compartment such as the lisozomes to which the cell-surface
proteins are transported.We have now been able to shed light on the mechanisms by
which a cell surface protein which serves as a receptor
for a cytokine, the p55 TNF receptor, is shed by cells.
There are two distinct receptors, the p55 and p75
receptors, by which TNF, a cytokine produced primarily by
mononuclear phagocytes, initiates its multiple effects on 
cell function. Both receptors are expressed in many cell
types yet in differing amounts and proportions. The
variation in their amounts seems to affect significantly
the nature and intensity of the cellular response to TNF.
One of the ways by which their expression is regulated is
through induced shedding of the receptors. They can be
shed in response to different kinds of inducing agents,
depending on the type of cells. Granulocytes, for
example, shed both receptors in response to the
chemotactic peptide - fMLP (formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine)
and shed specifically their p75 receptor when
treated by TNF, while in T lymphocytes shedding of the
p75 receptor, which is the predominant TNF receptor
species in these cells, occurs upon antigen stimulation.Shedding of both receptors may also effectively be
induced by PMA (phorbol myristate acetate),
