<ABSTRACT>
A non-contacting joystick (100) includes a 
control shaft (105) being universally movable about a 

Z-axis. A spherical conducting body (115) is attached 
to an end of the control shaft (105). A plurality of 

conducting plates (120) are disposed circumjacent to 
the spherical body (115). A charging power supply 

(125) supplies electrical energy of a first polarity 
to the spherical body (115) and electrical energy of a 

second polarity to the plurality of conducting plates 
(120). Each conducting plate (120) forms a variable 

capacitor (130) with the spherical body (115). The 
capacitance value of each variable capacitor (130) is 

a function of the displacement of the spherical body 
(115) relative to the Z-axis. A circuit (300) 

produces a plurality of position signals, each 
position signal being responsive to a capacitance 

value of a respective variable capacitor (130). The 
position signals indicate the relative position of the 

spherical body (115).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a non-contacting 
joystick and, more particularly, to a non-contacting 
joystick for controlling a work implement 
of a machine. In the field of work machines, particularly 
those machines which perform digging or loading 
functions such as excavators, backhoe loaders, and 
front shovels, the work implements are generally 
manually controlled with two or more operator controls 
in addition to other machine function controls. The 
manual control system often includes foot pedals as 
well as hand operated levers. There are several areas 
in which these types of implement control schemes can 
be improved to alleviate operator stress and fatigue 
resulting from the manipulation of multiple levers and 
foot pedals. For example, a machine operator is 
required to possess a relatively high degree of 
expertise to manipulate and coordinate the multitude 
of control levers and foot pedals proficiently. To 
become productive an inexperienced operator requires a 
long training period to become familiar with the 
controls and associated functions. Some manufacturers recognize the 
disadvantages of having too many control levers and 
have adapted a two-lever control scheme as the norm. 
Generally, two vertically mounted joysticks share the 
task of controlling the linkages (boom, stick, and 
bucket) of the work implement. For example, 
Caterpillar excavators employ one joystick for stick  
 
and swing control, and another joystick for boom and 
bucket control. However, the two-lever control scheme 
presently used in the industry may still be improved 
to provide for better productivity. One disadvantage of the joysticks of this 
type is the use of contacting switches. For example, 
joystick contacting switches are used to control 
direction of movement. However, such switches are 
subject to wear, necessitating switch replacement or 
repair. Thus, the long term cost of such joysticks is 
quite high. Further, when a joystick is not operating 
properly, the machine cannot be used. This "down-time" 
greatly adds unacceptable burdens to the machine 
owner/leasor due to time restrictions on most jobs. Several attempts have been made to overcome 
the problems of contact-type joysticks. For example, 
the non-contacting control-handle discussed in U.S 
Patent No. 4,434,412 and the control signal generator 
discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,654,576 each teach the 
use of inductive sensors for detecting the 
displacement of a control shaft from a neutral 
position. However, such inductive
