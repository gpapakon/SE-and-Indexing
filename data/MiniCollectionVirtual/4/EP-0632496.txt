<ABSTRACT>
An encapsulated electronic part (1) has a resin body (2) and a 
projecting holding member (3) removably attached to the resin body (2) 

which may be made of the same resin and formed at the same time 
as the resin body (2). The encapsulated electronic part (1) may be 

conveyed to a test device (6) or to a circuit board and mounted 
thereon by gripping the holding member (3) with a holding device (5). 

The holding member (3) may have a shape conforming to the shape of 
the holding device (5) and may be separated from the resin body (2) by 

moving the holding device (5) while holding the resin body (2) stationary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of packaging
circuits having electronic circuit components such as ICs,
capacitors, transistors, diodes and the like, and to a packaged
circuit arrangement.Electronic circuit components such as ICs are generally
manufactured and packaged in the following manner.First, molten resin is injected through a die gate into
a series of die cavities containing semiconductor circuit
components mounted on spaced portions of a beltlike lead frame
member extending through the cavities so as to encapsulate the
circuit components in separate resin body packages. The resin
is cooled and the die gate runner is removed from the encapsulated
components, and the lead frame is then divided by
punching to produce separate resin bodies containing ICs.The ICs are then carried and deposited in order on a
chute having beltlike grooves and moved to a predetermined
position.In one arrangement, the ICs are carried by a suction
collet which exerts suction produced by a vacuum created by a
vacuum pump and the suction collet engages a surface of the
resin body of the encapsulated IC to hold it while it is being 
carried. The suction collet is connected to a motor-driven
positioning slide which is movable in horizontal and vertical
directions so as to convey the ICs one after another past an
inspection station.The piping from the vacuum pump to the suction collet
is arranged with a pneumatic sensor, for example, which detects
engagement of a resin body by the suction collet, and the
completion of movement of each IC may also be identified
thereby.At the inspection stage, each IC conveyed to an inspection
device such as an electrical measuring socket is subjected
to quality inspection and only the good ICs are conveyed on a
conveyor belt to a predetermined position at the next stage of
manufacture, while the defective ones are removed.When an encapsulated IC has thus been inspected and
conveyed to the predetermined position, a chuck is used to grip
and move the encapsulated IC onto a circuit board on which
electronic parts are assembled and then packaged.However, the following problems are encountered in the
prior art methods of holding and moving packaged ICs containing
electronic parts for inspection and for mounting on circuit
boards.When packaged ICs are conveyed using a suction-type
collet, for example, a resin burr produced when the lead frame
is encapsulated may cling to the surface of the resin body of
the IC produced at the punching stage. While being conveyed on 
the conveyor, the
