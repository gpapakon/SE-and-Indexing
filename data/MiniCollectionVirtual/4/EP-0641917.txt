<ABSTRACT>
The leading edge of the turbine airfoil (12) of a 
turbine blade (10) for a gas turbine engine is cooled by 

utilizing helix shaped holes (40) that are rectangular 
in cross-section and curved to produce film holes 

egressing at low angles adjacent the outer surface of 
the leading edge. The helix holes (40) extend from the 

root (14) to the tip (16) of the blade and are 
parallelly and longitudinally spaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to internal cooling
of airfoils of blades and vanes in particular but not
exclusively for gas turbine engines and particularly to
means for cooling the leading edge of the airfoils.As is well known in gas turbine engine
technology, the leading edge of the airfoils of
turbine blades are cooled through a combination
of film cooling and coolant-side heat transfer
augmentation. As one skilled in this art will
appreciate, airfoil cooling technology that has
evolved over the years during the course of the
development of the gas turbine engine, is such
that each portion of the airfoil has given rise
to its own particular requirements which have
manifested different and unique techniques to
attain maximum cooling. For example, the leading
edge, trailing edge, tip section, the mid-section
require different techniques to attain maximum
cooling effectiveness. The reason that the
cooling aspect of the turbine is so abundantly
important and has required the demanding
attention of the engine designer and particularly
giving each portion of the airfoil individualized
attention is because the efficiency of the gas 
turbine engine is greatly enhanced by increasing
turbine temperatures. However, the limiting
factor of this temperature resides in the
tolerance to heat that the.particular materials
used for these components exhibit. The material
of the components subjected to the engine's hot
gasses must retain their physical strength and as
is well known the strength rapidly decreases at
elevated temperatures.Also well known in this technology is that
the limiting life of the airfoil has been the
shortcomings in the cooling effectiveness of the
leading edge. Heretofore, the cooling techniques
encompassed in the leading edge are in the
coolant-side heat transfer augmentations which
include impingement and radial flow with trip
strips and film cooling. Film cooling is
accomplished by machining a large number of
tightly-packed cooling holes into the leading
edge area.While there have been dramatic improvements
in the average cooling effectiveness of the
airfoil, the leading edge remains the life
limiting location. This is understandable because
the external area of the leading edge that is
exposed to hot gasses is greater than the
internal area of the leading edge that is exposed
to coolant. This imbalance at the leading edge is
far greater than what is evidenced in other
portions of the airfoil. In addition, heat load
per unit area is highest at the leading edge 
where heat transfer coefficients peak.
