<ABSTRACT>
A two-piece ostomy appliance is disclosed having a 
faceplate component (10) and a pouch component (11), the faceplate 

component including a flexible attachment ring (26) having an 
annular outer flange portion (27) and an inner collar portion (28) 

for insertion into the side opening (34) of the pouch component 
when the two are releasably joined together. The flushable 

pouch has a pair of side walls (30,31) joined together along their 
outer margins with each wall comprising a primary layer (30a,31a) of 

strong but water-soluble material and a protective inner 
layer (30b,31b) of relatively weak but water-insoluble material. 

When the components are adhesively joined together, the 
protective collar of the faceplate attachment ring extends 

into the side opening of the pouch to shield the edge (or 
edges) of the water-soluble layer (or layers) from exposure 

to fluids and other matter discharged through the stoma-receiving 
opening of the faceplate into the pouch, thereby 

protecting the water-soluble layer(s) from premature 
disintegration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a two-piece ostomy appliance 
having a faceplate component and a pouch component wherein 
the faceplate has a protective collar for shielding 
surrounding edges of the water-soluble layer (or layers) of 
the pouch from fluids which pass through the side opening 
in the pouch wall. Two-piece ostomy appliances having faceplate components 
and pouch components are well known in the art. For 
examples of such devices, reference may be had to co-owned 
U.S. patents 4,419,100, 4,610,676 and 4,610,677. Recently it has been considered desirable to provide 
flushable ostomy pouches that may be discarded into toilet 
bowls or water closets. The walls or panels of such a 
pouch are typically composed of at least two layers, 
specifically, a tough flexible, but water-soluble or 
water-dispersible primary layer which gives the pouch its 
structural integrity and a thin, water-insoluble inner 
layer which lines the inside of the pouch and prevents the 
pouch's contents from contacting and dissolving the primary 
layer when the pouch is worn. Although the primary layer 
gives the pouch its strength, once the pouch is discarded 
into the bowl of a flush toilet, the primary layer, being 
exposed to water in the bowl, quickly dissolves allowing 
the weaker interior layer to disintegrate and disperse by 
the turbulence of water when the toilet is flushed. A characteristic shortcoming of such a system is that 
either an edge of the primary water-soluble layer is left 
exposed about the stoma-receiving side opening of the pouch 
where it may be contacted by aqueous body fluids discharged  
 
into the pouch that could result in premature disintegration 
of the pouch while it is being worn, or some 
additional means or manufacturing technique must be 
utilized to protect such edge from contact with effluent. 
The first of these approaches assumes that the risk of 
pouch failure may be minimized by limiting the length of 
time a given pouch is worn (see U.S. patent 4,772,279), 
whereas the second approach necessarily increases the 
complexity and cost of pouch construction and manufacture 
and may also have the undesirable result of weakening the 
structure of the pouch in the region of its stoma-receiving 
opening. Examples of this second approach are found in 
U.S. patents 4,917,689 (an additional ring or flange is 
secured to the inner layer and extends through the 
stoma-receiving opening of the pouch to cover the edge of 
the dissolvable primary layer), 4,772,279 (the background

<CLAIMS>
A two-piece ostomy appliance comprising a faceplate 
component (10) and a flushable pouch component (11); 

   said faceplate component comprising a thin, flexible, 
adhesive-coated patch (13) having a stoma-receiving opening (20) 

and a relatively stiff but flexible attachment ring (26) formed 
of water-insoluble material and secured to said patch about said 

opening; 
   said attachment ring (26) having a thin outer flange portion 

(27) and an inner annular collar portion (28) extending axially 
away from both said flange portion and said patch and having an 

opening (29) concentric with said stoma-receiving opening (20)

   said pouch component (10) having a pair of side walls 
(30,31) joined together along their outer margins and each 

comprising a primary layer (30a,31a) of strong but water-soluble 
material capable of quickly dissolving in the water of a toilet 

bowl in which the pouch is discardable and a protective inner 
layer (30b,31b) of relatively weak but water-insoluble material 

incapable of maintaining the structural integrity of said pouch 
when said primary layer (30a,31a) is dissolved; 

   one of said walls (31) having a side opening (34)
