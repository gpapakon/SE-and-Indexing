<ABSTRACT>
A theft detection system comprising an interrogation unit and a 
detection unit for generating an electromagnetic interrogation 

field with a predetermined frequency and detecting the presence 
of electronic labels belonging to the system in the interrogation 

field. The electronic labels generate a reply signal in the 
interrogation field by means of a resonant circuit which 

comprises at least a coil and a capacitor and which also 
functions as receiving circuit for the interrogation field. The 

labels comprise means which provide a frequency-switched signal 
with the aid of which the signal generated by the interrogation 

field in the resonance circuit is modulated via a first switching 
element in such a manner that at least two high-frequency signal 

components arise which are located within the resonance curve of 
the resonance circuit, in such a manner that these signal 

components are strongly present in the secondary magnetic field 
formed by the coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shoplifting detection system 
comprising an interrogation unit and a detection unit for 
generating an electromagnetic interrogation field with a 
predetermined frequency and detecting the presence of electronic 
labels belonging to the system in the interrogation field, these 
electronic labels generating a reply signal in the interrogation 
field by means of a resonant circuit which comprises at least a 
coil and a capacitor and which also functions as receiving 
circuit for the interrogation field. Well known are the systems based on the detection of an LC 
circuit brought into resonance as described in U.S. Patent No. 
5,051,727. This reference mentions an air coil which is tuned to 
the resonance frequency by means of a capacitor connected in 
parallel. Detection labels that are suitable for this technique 
are relatively inexpensive to produce in large numbers. These 
labels can also be produced at a very low price in the form of 
adhesive labels intended to be used only once. If desired, the 
labels may be deactivatable. A drawback of this known technique is that conductive 
articles in the immediate surroundings of the coil may detune 
this coil and dampen it. As a consequence, this technique is less 
suitable for protecting articles that contain metal. According to another prior art technique, strips of saturable 
magnetic material are employed. European patent application no. 
92200765.3 (Granovsky) gives an example of a detection system 
based on this technique. Such magnetic strips also function when 
they are stuck onto metallic articles. However, the disadvantage 
of these magnetic strips is that the detection distance is very 
limited, so that wide passageways cannot be protected. One technique enabling detection of metallic articles in the 
case of larger passage widths involves making use of mechanical 
resonance of a plate of magnetic material which is caused to 
vibrate by means of the magnetostriction effect in a magnetic  
 
alternating field. U.S. Patent No. 4,510,489 gives an example of 
such a detection system. A fundamental problem of this method is that the plate in 
question has to vibrate mechanically and for that purpose has to 
be freely suspended in a small chamber, so that no mechanical 
damping occurs. However, by manually deforming the chamber from outside, the 
resonance effect can be suppressed and thereby the label can be 
effectively inactivated. Such a label can also be rendered 
ineffective by means of a permanent magnet. In the theft
