<CLAIMS>
A method of making a web or sliver consisting of mineral fibres
and organic fibres, characterised in that it comprises introducing into

a condenser, firstly a carded mat consisting essentially of organic

fibres, and secondly, mineral fibre rovings.
A method of making a web or sliver consisting of mineral fibres
and organic fibres according to Claim 1, characterised in that the

mineral fibre rovings undergo, before their introduction into the said
condenser, an operation of defibrillation or bulking.
A method of making a web or sliver consisting of mineral fibres
and organic fibres according to Claim 2, characterised in that the

operation of defibrillation or bulking is carried out by subjecting the
said rovings to vibrations in an appropriate frequency and intensity.
A method of making a web or sliver consisting of mineral fibres
and organic fibres according to Claim 3, characterised in that the said

operation of defibrillation or bulking is performed by means of
vibrating curtains.
A method of making a web or sliver consisting of mineral fibres
and organic fibres according to any one of the preceding Claims,

characterised in that an operation of cutting the mineral fibre rovings
is carried out in the condenser.
A web or sliver consisting of mineral fibres and organic fibres,
made by a method according to any one of the preceding Claims, 

characterised in that the said organic fibres comprise from 0 to 50%
by weight of viscose fibres and 50 to 100% by weight of acrylic

fibres.
A web or sliver according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
said glass fibres comprise multifilaments having a diameter in the

range between 3 and 20 Âµm.
