<ABSTRACT>
The energy detection procedure for useful signals embedded in noise, consists, according to the invention, starting from a frame of samples of a noisy signal, grouped into successive frames, in performing a preclassification by comparing the energies of the successive samples of each frame with a specified optimal threshold and in classing into a first "noise only" class the samples which exhibit a high probability of belonging to this class, and then, for each of these samples, those exhibiting a sufficiently high energy for their probability of belonging to a second "noise + useful signal" class to be high are detected, this second class being defined by taking the first class as reference.

Energy-based method for detecting useful 
signals in the presence of noise, comprising a 

preclassification step followed by a detection step, 
the said preclassification step consisting, on the 

basis of a set of samples of a noisy signal which are 
grouped into successive frames, in deciding as a 

function of the mutual ratios of the energies of the 
successive frames, the decision being actually based on 

the calculation of a distance which is the absolute 
value of the difference of the logarithms of the two 

energies, and on the comparison of this distance with 
an optimal threshold (Log(s)) so as to class within a 

first "noise only" class at least some of the frames 
likely to be members of this class; the said detection 

step consisting in the detection for the other frames, 
of those exhibiting a sufficiently high energy relative 

to a reference energy (Eo) calculated on the basis of 
the energies of the "noise only" frames identified 

during the preclassification step so that these 
detected frames exhibit a high probability of 

membership of a second "noise + useful signal" class. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the calculation of an optimal threshold is done by 
applying the maximum likelihood criterion when the 

correct decision probability is known. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the calculation of the optimal threshold is done  
 

by applying the Neyman-Pearson criterion when the 
correct decision probability is not known. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 membership of the second 
class is determined by applying the maximum likelihood 

criterion when the correct decision probability is 
known. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 membership of the second class is 
determined by applying the Neyman-Pearson criterion 

when the correct decision probability is not known. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 after having processed a 
first frame of samples, an autoregressive model of the 

noise is calculated and is used to whiten the 
succeeding frames, on the basis of a set of frames 

consisting, with high probability, of noise alone. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that
 after having highlighted a set of 
frames consisting, with high probability, of noise 

only, a mean spectrum of the noise is calculated and 
noise-suppression is applied to the succeeding frames. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the results acquired for 
a frame of samples are utilized for reupdating the 

results of the previous frame.
