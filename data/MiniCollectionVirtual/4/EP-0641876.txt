<CLAIMS>
Fibre processing installation with a bale opening device (1), a coarse cleaning

machine (4) and a control means (53.1; 53.2), 
characterized in that
 the bale opening
device (1) is suitable for opening fibre materials of different provenances (A, B, C, D,

E), whereby the bale opening device (1) is adjustable in dependence of the fibre
material to be processed, that the coarse cleaning machine (4) likewise is adjustable

in dependence of fibre material which is to be processed, and that the control means
(53.1; 53.2) is equipped in such a manner that the coarse cleaning machine (4) is

adjusted in dependence of the fibre material momentarily being supplied by the bale
opening device (1).
Installation according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the control means (53.1; 53.2)
is a microcomputer control unit.
Installation according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the control means
(53.1; 53.2) delivers a signal, which affects the speed of an input roller (16) of the

coarse cleaning machine (4).
Installation according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the control means
(53.1; 53.2) delivers a signal, which causes the setting of cleaning rods (18) of the

coarse cleaning machine (4).
Installation according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the setting of the angles of the
rods (18) is affected by the signal.
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the space
(Z) between the individual bales of different provenances (A, B, C, D, E) has a given

size, so that the bale-opening device (1) does not have to be stopped, in order to
have time for the setting of the operating components (16,18) of the coarse cleaning

machine (4). 
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
control means (53.1; 53.2) delivers an output signal, which affects the speed of the

take-off roller (14) of the bale-opening device (1).
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
control means (53.1; 53.2) emits an outlet signal, which affects the feed speed of the

bale-opening device (1).
Installation according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
control means (53.1; 53.2) delivers an output signal, which affects the entering depth

of the bale-opening device (1).
A controlled cleaning method for cotton wool fibre, whereby the fibre material is
opened by a bale opening device (1) and supplied to a coarse cleaning machine (4),


characterized in that
 the bale opening device (1) takes off fibre materials of different
provenances (A, B, C, D, E), whereby the bale opening device (1) is adjustable in

dependence of the material which is to be processed, and that the coarse cleaning
machine (4) is adjusted in dependence of fibre material momentarily being supplied

by the bale-opening device (1).
Method according to claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the throughput amount depends
on the setting of the bale opening device (1) and that this throughput amount is

being processed by the coarse cleaning machine (4).
