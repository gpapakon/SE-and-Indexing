<DESCRIPTION>
 VACDÏ‹M ASSISTED LOADING SYSTEMThe present invention relates to a vacuum assisted system for loading a liquid product into a tank. More particularly, the present invention relates to vacuum assisted system for use on tanker loading racks in a petroleum product terminal.Vacuum assisted loading systems for use on loading racks and product terminals are provided to reduce vapor emissions. In these vacuum systems, the vapor expelled from a tank, truck or car during petroleum product loading are withdrawn through a vacuum hose and passed to a vapor recovery system which may either sorb the hydrocarbons in a sorbent bed or incinerate the hydrocarbons in a burner. The prime mover of the vapor from the tank to the vapor recovery system is the pressure of the product being loaded in the tank which may be in the order of thousands of gallons per minute. In prior emission recovery systems, the vapor recovery hose was hooked by a standard coupling to the tank. This coupling was not designed to be vapor or leak proof. Accordingly there was a significant amount of vapor escaping through the coupling. Some jurisdictions have a requirement that a vacuum be placed on the vapor recovery hose. This requirement may be that a minimum vacuum of -8.5" of water be maintained on the vapor recovery hose while a tank is being loaded with a petroleum product. However, a maximum value is inherent and is set by the tank structure. Specifically, excessive vacuum may cause tank cells to collapse.In one system, a large blower is installed in a header which runs overhead of a plurality of tanker loading bays, each bay having a downwardly extending conduit rig for connection to the tank of a tanker truck in a specific bay. This system senses the pressure in each downwardly extending loading system in each bay, and should the vacuum exceed what is needed 

in a specific bay the downwardly extending conduit system would be closed off from the overhead header. This system requires a relatively large and complex control scheme. Further, by taking a bay conduit system out of the vacuum scheme there is raised a possibility that there will be large variations in the header vacuum level. These variations will cause large fluctuations in liquid loading. One prior system includes an incinerator, and it is preferable to maintain a relatively constant hydrocarbon to air ratio to insure optimum combustion.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a vacuum assisted system for loading a liquid product containing vapor into a tank

CLAIMS :
1. A vacuum assisted system for loading a liquid product containing vapor into a tank comprising: means for loading the liquid product under pressure into said tank; means for disposing of vapor recovered from said tank during loading; conduit means for interconnecting said tank and said vapor disposing means; a blower in said conduit means for applying a predetermined vacuum to said tank, whereby the loading means pressure and the blower vacuum act to move vapor from the tank to the vapor disposal means; a by-pass conduit formed between the outlet and the inlet sides of said blower; and valve means in said by-pass conduit responsive to the vacuum at the inlet side of said blower for progressively opening to permit by-pass flow of vapor from the outlet side to the inlet side of said blower, whereby maximum by-pass is provided when the vacuum approaches a predetermined maximum level.
2. The system of claim 1 further comprising means for sensing vacuum at the inlet side of said blower and enabling said loading means to operate only when the vacuum is above a predetermined mininum value and below a predetermined maximum value.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein said vacuum sensing means provides a signal to said valve means to control the by-pass flow of vapor. 


4. The system of claim 1 wherein valve means comprises a valve seat, a valve stem extending through said valve seat, a valve at one end of said stem, a spring at the other end of said valve stem for biasing said valve against said valve seat, and a diaphragm interposed between said spring and said valve seat for pulling said valve stem away from said spring to progressively open said valve in response to an increasing vacuum.
5. The system of claim 5 wherein said valve means is arranged to remain in an open position in the event of said stem, said spring or said diaphragm failing.
6. The system of claim 5 wherein said valve means further comprises a vacuum line interconnecting the inlet side of said blower and said diaphragm whereby an increase in sensed vacuum will pull said diaphragm toward said valve seat.
7. The system of claim 1 wherein said conduit means comprises a header extending across and above a plurality of tank loading bays; and wherein each bay comprises piping which extends from said header for connection to a respective tank and which includes a separate blower, by-pass conduit and by-pass valve means.
8. The system of claim 1 wherein said disposing means comprises means for separating liquids from said recovered vapor.
9. The system of claim 1 wherein said disposing means comprises means for incinerating said recovered vapor.
