<ABSTRACT>
The invention belongs to the field of physics, more specifically, 
to measuring equipment and can be used for measuring the surface 

temperature of the bodies of complicated shape and also for 
measuring the temperature of gases and liquids. 
The problem at the solution of which the given invention is aimed 
and the technical result realised by it can be formulated as 

creating the surface film resistance thermometer which helps to 
provide for the increased accuracy of measurement and to achieve 

the interchangeability of the resistance thermometers of the same 
type. 
The resistance thermometer has a film sensing element 1 with 
contact leads 2 and 3. The sensing element 1 with dielectric and 

adhesional coating applied to it is encased into flexible 
dielectric shell. The layer 5 of metal of the sensing element 1 

alternated with layer 6 of material different from the material of 
the sensing element 1 are applied over flexible dielectric.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention belongs to the field of physics, more specifically, 
to measuring equipment and can be used for measuring the surface 
temperature of the bodies of complicated shape and also for 
measuring the temperature of gases and liquids; can be used also 
in standard technical resistance thermometers. A platinum film resistance thermometer containing a flat ceramic 
backing and a platinum film sensing element with contact leads 
applied to it in the form of meander is known from modern level of 
technology. To protect the active platinum layer from damage and 
exposure to environment the sensing element as well as the 
ceramic backing is covered with protective ceramic coating. (Franzis Electronic-Fachbuch, Gerhard Wiegleb,"Sensortechnik. 
Ubersicht, Application, Anwendungen", 1986, Franzis-Verlag GmbH, 
Munchen.) [1]
 
For measuring the surface temperature of bodies the surface film 
probes are used - the sensing elements usually made of nickel or 
platinum and encased into flexible plastic shell. A surface film 
resistance thermometer containing a film sensing element in the 
form of meander with contact leads at its ends chosen as a 
prototype can serve as the example of such thermometer. ("Les Capteurs en Instrumentation Industrielle", par Georges 
Asch, Ingenieur E.S.E., Professeur a l'universite Lyon 1 avec la 
collaboration, BORDAS, Paris, 1991) [2]
 
Assessing the existing level of technology it can be said that 
the analogue of the resistance thermometer 1 itself is not stable 
enough and, consequently, has the lowered accuracy of measurement. 
The reason for the instability is the soiling of platinum by the 
reinforced material and appearance of mechanical stress while 
using it due to different coefficients of thermal expansion of the  
 
material of the ceramic backing and that of the sensing element 
(platinum). Concerning the prototype of the resistance thermometer [2] it 
should be noted that the coefficients of thermal expansion of the 
dielectric shell and of the sensing element are different, and 
the resistance of the sensing element depends on the deformations 
of the thermometer. In this situation it proves to be impossible 
to create interchangeable thermometers as they all need individual 
graduation, each possessing a specific nature of its own. Besides, 
such thermometers possess histeresis due to the chemical 
interaction of the material of the shell with the material of the 
sensing element, and the dislocations leading to histeresis of 
the electric properties of the

The surface film resistance thermometer, containing a film 
metal sensing element 1 in the form of meander with contact leads 

2 and 3 at its ends, encased into a flexible dielectric shell with 
the distinction that the sensing element 1 is produced with 

dielectric chemical inert ceramic coating applied to it on both 
sides and adhesional coating applied to the sensing element 1 over 

protective ceramic coating forming the "splint" of the sensing 
element 1, where the correlation between the total thickness L1 of 

protective ceramic and adhesional coating and the thickness L0 of 
the metallic film of the sensing element 1 is determined by the 

inequality L1/ L0

produced in the form of film coating of the same thickness L2 on 

both sides applied to both sides of the sensing element 1, 
connected and interacting directly with the sensing element 1 and 

filling in the spaces in the intervals between its branches, the 
resistance thermometer is supplied with layers of metal 5 applied 

to both surfaces of the flexible dielectric 4 shell, successively 
alternated with each other in the same order on both sides of the 

latter, of the material of the sensing element 1 and heat and 
chemically stable material 6 other than the material of the 

sensing element 1, while the average coefficient of thermal 
expansion K of the resistance thermometer satisfies the 

correlation K=Km, where Km - the coefficient of thermal expansion 
of the metal - material of the sensing element 1.

distinction that the correlation of the total thickness of the 

metal of the sensing element 1 including the thickness L0 of the 
sensing element 1 itself 2L3+L0 and the total thickness 2L2 of the 

flexible dielectric 4 shell satisfies the following inequality 
 

where
 

Em - modulus of elasticity of the metal of the sensing element 1, 
Ep - modulus of elasticity of the flexible dielectric 4.

distinction that the coefficient of thermal expansion Kt of heat 

and chemically stable material 6, other than the material of the 
sensing element1 is chosen out of the following correlations:

The surface film resistance thermometer after p.1, with the 
distinction that with the layers of metal 5 of the material of 

the sensing element 1 and the layer of heat and chemically stable 
material 6 other than the material of the sensing element 1 

alternating more than once thus forming an alternating pair, the 
resistance thermometer is supplied with an additional layer 7 of 

flexible dielectric situated between the alternating pairs, at 
least one on each side of the flexible dielectric 4 shell.
