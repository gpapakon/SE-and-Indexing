<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to granulocyte colony
stimulating factor ("G-CSF") analogs.Hematopoiesis is controlled by two systems:
the cells within the bone marrow microenvironment and
growth factors. The growth factors, also called colony
stimulating factors, stimulate committed progenitor
cells to proliferate and to form colonies of
differentiating blood cells. One of these factors is
granulocyte colony stimulating factor, herein called
G-CSF, which preferentially stimulates the growth and
development of neutrophils, indicating a potential use
in neutropenic states. Welte et al., PNAS-USA 82: 1526-1530
(1985); Souza et al., Science 232: 61-65 (1986) and
Gabrilove, J. Seminars in Hematology 26: (2) 1-14
(1989).In humans, endogenous G-CSF is detectable in
blood plasma. Jones et al., Bailliere's Clinical
Hematology 2 (1): 83-111 (1989). G-CSF is produced by
fibroblasts, macrophages, T cells trophoblasts, 
expression product of a single copy gene comprised of
four exons and five introns located on chromosome
seventeen. Transcription of this locus produces a mRNA
species which is differentially processed, resulting in
two forms of G-CSF mRNA, one version coding for a
protein of 177 amino acids, the other coding for a
protein of 174 amino acids, Nagata et al., EMBO J 5:
575-581 (1986), and the form comprised of 174 amino
acids has been found to have the greatest specific in
vivo biological activity. G-CSF is species cross-reactive,
such that when human G-CSF is administered to
another mammal such as a mouse, canine or monkey,
sustained neutrophil leukocytosis is elicited. Moore et
al., PNAS-USA 84: 7134-7138 (1987).Human G-CSF can be obtained and purified from
a number of sources. Natural human G-CSF (nhG-CSF) can
be isolated from the supernatants of cultured human
tumor cell lines. The development of recombinant DNA
technology, see, for instance, U.S. Patent 4,810,643
(Souza) incorporated herein by reference, has enabled
the production of commercial scale quantities of G-CSF
in glycosylated form as a product of eukaryotic host
cell expression, and of G-CSF in non-glycosylated form
as a product of prokaryotic host cell expression.G-CSF has been found to be useful in the
treatment of indications where an increase in
neutrophils will provide benefits. For example, for
cancer patients, G-CSF is beneficial as a means of
selectively stimulating neutrophil production to
compensate for hematopoietic deficits resulting from
chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Other indications
include treatment of various infectious
