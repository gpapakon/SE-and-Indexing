<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a distributor rotor electrode for preventing
noise electric wave which prevents the
generation of noise electric wave, especially, the generation
of noise electric wave for the radio which is loaded on
automobiles and the like. The electrode according to the
present invention is used as a rotor electrode of a distributor
of automobile engines.In conventional distributor of an internal combustion of
automobiles, a rotor electrode rotates to intermittently oppose
a side-fixed electrode having a small clearance between them.
The rotor electrode and the side-fixed electrode discharge
between them so that they feed a number of ignition plugs.
However, in this conventional feeding method, noise electric
wave (ignition noise) is generated due to spark discharge
between the rotor electrode and the side-fixed electrode.
Since the noise electric wave has wide and high frequency band,
it causes hindrance on radiocommunication such as TV or radio, 
electronic equipments loaded on automobiles and the like; for
example, EFI (electronical controlled fuel injection
apparatus), ESC (electronic skid control apparatus), EAT
(electronic control automatic transmission).As shown in Figure 15, the above spark discharge current
comprises capacity discharge current and induction discharge
current. The capacity discharge current is high-frequency
current which flows for 10 micron seconds from the beginning of
discharge at the initial discharge stage due to rapid build-up.
The induction discharge current is low-frequency current (about
10 to 100mA) which continuously flows for 500 to 1500 micron
seconds soon after the capacity discharge current flows.Ignition energy supplied for the ignition plug is
proportionated with the product of the induction discharge
current and its discharge duration. Concerning the induction
discharge current, since the absolute value level of the
current value is low, it has little influence on the noise
electric wave. Therefore, in order to effectively prevent the
noise electric wave without decreasing the ignition energy, it
is important that the starting voltage and the capacity
discharge current are firmly decreased.Conventionally, various measures for preventing noise
electric wave have been taken. For example, a method for 
placing the resistor outside or inside of the plug, a method
for introducing resistance to a part of high-voltage wiring, a
method for establishing a condenser in order to prevent noise.
However, in these methods, effects are not sufficient and
reliabil
