An electronic circuit includes an array of a plurality of memory cells that 
are functionally organized in rows and columns. The circuit comprises test means that 

are selectively operative to access all cells of the array in parallel. An I
DDQ
-test then 
discovers whether or not there is a defect in any of the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electronic circuitry with a memory having a
plurality of memory cells that are functionally organized in rows and columns.Systematic and automatic testing of electronic circuitry, and of integrated
circuits in particular, becomes increasingly more important. Each next generation of
circuits tends to develop ever higher component densities and an ever growing number
of system functionalities. Individual circuits have become complicated to such an extent
that process defects cannot be detected and located anymore save by exhaustive and
expensive testing. Customers cannot be expected to accept circuitry products that show
their hidden defects in operational use, thereby rendering, e.g., life support systems or
aircraft control systems, unreliable. It is therefore of the utmost importance for both the
manufacturer and the customer that tests are run to guarantee flawless operation of the
circuit products.Random access memories (SRAMs, DRAMs) are usually subjected to
march tests and/or data retention tests. In a march test, a sequence of read and/or write
operations are applied to every cell of the memory, either in increasing or decreasing
address order. In data retention tests, every cell is written and checked after a pre-specified
wait-time to see whether or not current leakage has occurred that has affected
the stored logic state. Note that memory cells in a bit oriented memory and groups of
memory cells in a word-oriented memory are accessible only successively, thus giving
rise to lengthy test procedures.Conventional testing of semiconductor memories that have a storage
capacity in the order of 1 Mbit or larger makes up a considerable percentage of the
production costs. For, e.g., a 4 Mbit DRAM this percentage well amounts to 10%. For
larger memories, this percentage increases even further as the time required to conduct
the test grows with extension of the storage capacity. For a 64 Mbit DRAM testing is 
estimated to cost 240 times as much as testing a 1 Mbit DRAM. This should imply that
the ratio of the test cost and the total cost of a 64 Mbit DRAM then amounts to
approximately 40%, which is unacceptably high. Accordingly, with increasing transistor
densities and with increasing number of system functionalities that can be integrated on
a semiconductor substrate (including wafer scale devices), prior art testing has become a
major factor in determining the commercial viability of an IC memory product. For
