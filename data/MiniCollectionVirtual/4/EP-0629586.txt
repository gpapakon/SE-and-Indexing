<ABSTRACT>
Process for the decontamination of contaminated water with the aid of an absorbent product bound onto grains of a rigid material. A permeable structure is placed across the flow of the contaminated ground water, the structure consisting of calibrated grains such as, for example, gravel, which are coated with a grout whose composition makes it possible to trap the contaminating waste present in the ground water. The invention also relates to a permeable structure usable in the application of this process and to the process for the manufacture of the said structure.

Process for decontamination of contaminated water, with
the aid of an absorbent product bound on grains made of a

rigid material, characterized in that, to decontaminate
ground water, a permeable structure is placed across the

flow at the contaminated water table, consisting of
calibrated grains such as, for example, gravel, which are

coated with a grout the composition of which makes it
possible to trap the contaminating waste present in the

water table.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
grains coated with fresh grout are placed in the soil before

the hardening of the grout and in that after hardening a
structure is obtained which is rigid, permeable and

retaining of the contaminating water, corresponding to the
nature of the grout.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
grout-coated grains are treated in a granulator so that they

do not adhere to one another and that they are in the form
of independent granulates coated with hardened grout and

which retain the contaminating waste.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the hardened grout completely covers

each grain, adhering strongly thereto.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that grains consisting of sands, gravels or

other aggregates are employed, such as those commonly
employed for producing mortars or concretes.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the grains are from 0.3 to 10 mm in

size and preferably from 1 to 8 mm 
Process according to any one of the preceding claims
characterized in that a volume of grout in cubic metres is

employed which is between 5 and 25 % and preferably between
10 and 20 % of the weight of the grains expressed in tons.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the grains have a diameter greater

than or equal to approximately 300 microns.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the grout contains hydraulic binders.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that at the time of its mixing with the

grains, the fresh grout has an initial rigidity of between
approximately 400 mm
2
 per gram and approximately 700 mm
2
 per
gram.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a grout based on clay and kieselgur is

employed, which is capable of retaining radioactive
contaminants.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that a grout based on clay, siliceous

products, sodium carbonate and sodium pyrophosphate and/or
potassium tartrate is employed, which is capable of

retaining the contaminants consisting of metal cations.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that a grout based on bentonite and active

carbon is employed, which is capable of retaining organic
contaminants.
Process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a filtering mass is placed upstream of

the permeable structure to retain the fine particles which 
are carried by the water table and which could block the

said structure.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 14,
characterized in that the grout-coated grains form a rigid

whole by being joined to one another.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 14,
characterized in that the grout-coated grains are

independent from one another.
