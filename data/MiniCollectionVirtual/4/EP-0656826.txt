<ABSTRACT>
Device for the impregnation of sheets of elastic foamed resin with thermoplastic substances. In particular said sheets, due to their particular molecular structure, once impregnated with bitumen and conveniently compressed, can keep the bitumen ensuring a good impermeabilization. For these reasons they find a good application in the building sector. In particular the device comprises driving and guiding means of the foamed resin sheet, a hopper fed with bitumen and two calendering rollers. The calendering rollers are heated and have, respectively, an external surface with lattice shape and an external surface coated with an elastomer material resistant to high temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
"DEVICE FOR THE IMPREGNATION WITH THERMOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES OF BANDS OR SHEETS MADE OF FOAMED RESIN"The present invention concerns a device for the impregnation with thermoplastic substances of bands or sheets made of elastic foamed resin having an at least partially open cellular structure. Said sheets are particularly effective for the impermeabilization of surfaces that must be weatherproof, and therefore they are mainly used in the building sector.In particular waterproof sealing materials are increasingly used, generally consisting of a supporting structure made of elastically compressible foamed resin (foamed polyurethan) , impregnated with a thermoplastic substance such as for instance bitumen or similar material. Even after having been imbued, the foamed resin maintains its elastic properties so as it can be compressed, and therefore made waterproof, before its installation. In fact an effective impermeabilization of the foamed resin sheet can be obtained during its processing by - means of an appropriate compression. In particular, what happens is that the initially open cells, which are impregnated for example with bitumen, gradually close as they are increasingly compressed, until the element is made completely waterproof. 

One of the most effective processes for the production of this material is the calendering process. It consists in conveying the foamed resin sheet through a hopper containing thermoplastic material, for example bitumen, and then through a couple of calendering cylinders or rollers operated by a motor. Cylinders are heated so as to keep the bitumen at the viscous state; the foamed resin sheets are guided by driving rollers and suitable guides in such a way that they enter the hopper and then the calendering rollers following a more or less vertical path.However it is necessary that the foamed resin sheet is guided during said process, and this in order to avoid deformations, tearings or breakings.One of the solutions of the known technique provides for instance a supporting belt on the path leading from the driving rollers as far as beyond the calendering rollers. This solution however presents the drawback of hindering the impregnation of the resin sheet through its surface which is in direct contact with the belt, as said belt is impermeable to the bitumen. Said drawback does not appear particularly serious when the foamed resin sheet introduced is made of polyurethan resin derived from polyethers, in that this material has a completely open cellular structure and, the
