<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns pumps which shall be able to operate totally 
or partly submersed into the pumped medium, the latter often containing 
large amounts of solid bodies. Examples are water on construction 
sites and waste water. Within the fields mentioned above the so-called vortex-flow pump 
provides certain advantages over conventional centrifugal pumps, 
especially at small dimensions. A vortex-flow pump is characterized by the fact that the impeller is axially displaced 
in the pump housing as compared with a conventional centrifugal pump. This means 
that a wide free throughlet is obtained and thus the risk for clogging is often 
diminished. Accordingly it is then often possible to use smaller pumps for pumping 
heavily polluted liquids and thus the costs can be reduced. The fact that a vortex 
impeller is simpler to manufacture than a centrifugal impeller further decreases the 
costs. An example is shown in US - A - 37 596 28. The vortex-flow pump has however certain disadvantages. The efficiency 
is often lower as compared with a conventional centrifugal pump. 
The head often becomes lower even at small volume flows and in addition 
the power demand rises rapidly at increasing volume flow. The purpose of the invention is thus to increase the efficiency and 
to increase the possible head, especially at small volume flows. This 
is obtained by help of the device stated in the claims. The invention is described below with reference to the enclosed 
drawings. Fig 1 shows a side view of a conventional vortex-flow pump, Fig 2 
shows a side view of a pump housing according to the invention, while 
Fig 3 shows a number of cuts through the pump housing showing the 
volume increase of the volute.  
 In the drawings 1 stands for a pump housing having inlet 2 and outlet 
3. 4 stands for a pump impeller having vanes 5. 6 stands for a cylinder 
formed part of the pump housing, 7 a spiral part having an outer 
wall 8 and a lower wall 9. 10, 11 and 12 stand for cuts through the 
wall at different points around the circumference. With reference to Fig 1 the operation of a conventional vortex-flow 
pump is described. The liquid is sucked in axially through the inlet 
2 and is thrown towards the circumference by the impeller vanes 5 on 
the impeller 4 and is finally pushed out through the outlet 3. The 
room between the bottom of the housing and the impeller vanes has a 
certain minimum dimension which is decided by state authorities when 
waste water is pumped. This in order to ensure that solid bodies up

<CLAIMS>
A pump housing of the so-called vortex-flow type provided with an impeller (4) with 
vanes (5), an axial inlet (2) and a tangential to radial outlet (3), characterized in that 

the part (6) where the inlet (2) is located is essentially circular with an increased 
diameter as compared with that of the inlet (2) and that the impeller (4) is located in 

the part (7) of the housing located remote from the inlet (2), said latter part (7) being 
designed like a volute having a continously increasing radius in the direction of the 

outlet (3). 
A pump housing according to claim 1, characterized in that the smallest diameter 
of the volute (7) corresponds with the diameter of the circular part (6).
