<ABSTRACT>
A CVD diamond wire drawing die has smaller diamond grains adjacent 
an initial diamond growth surface with larger diamond grains adjacent an 

opposing surface with an opening having a wire bearing portion of 
substantially circular cross-section determinative of the diameter of the 

wire positioned more closely adjacent to the initial growth surface in a 
region of smaller grains than to final large grained opposing surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diamond wire dies.Wires of metals such as tungsten, copper, iron, molybdenum, and
stainless steel are produced by drawing the metals through diamond dies.
Single crystal diamond dies are difficult to fabricate, tend to chip easily,
easily cleave, and often fail catastrophically because of the extreme
pressures involved during wire drawing.With reference to single crystal wire dies, it is reported in
Properties and Applications of Diamond, Wilks et al, Butterworth-Heinemann
Ltd 1991, pages 505-507: "The best choice of [crystallographic]
direction is not too obvious because as the wire passes through the die its
circumference is abrading the diamond on a whole 360° range of planes,
and the rates of wear on these planes will be somewhat different. Hence,
the originally circular hole will not only grow larger but will loose its
shape. However, 〈110〉 directions offer the advantage that the wire is
abrading the sides of the hole with {001} and {011} orientations in
abrasion resistant directions."Diamond dies which avoid some of the problems attendant with
natural diamonds of poorer quality comprise microporous masses
compacted from tiny crystals of natural or synthesized diamonds or from
crystals of diamond. The deficiencies of such polycrystalline hard masses,
as indicated in U.S. patent 4,016,736, are due to the presence of microvoids/pores
and soft inclusions. These voids and inclusions can be more
than 10 microns in diameter. The improvement of the patent utilizes a
metal cemented carbide jacket as a source of flowable metal which fills the
voids resulting in an improved wire die. European Patent Application 0 494 799 A1 describes a
polycrystalline CVD diamond layer having a hole formed therethrough
and mounted in a support. As set forth in column 2, lines 26-30, "The
relatively random distribution of crystal orientations in the CVD diamond
ensures more even wear during use of the insert." As set forth in column
3, lines 50-54, "The orientation of the diamond in the polycrystalline CVD
diamond layer 10 may be such that most of the crystallites have a (111)
crystallographic axis in the plane, i.e. parallel to the surfaces 14, 16, of the
layer 10.Other crystal orientations for CVD films are known. U.S. patent
5,110,579 to Anthony et al describes a transparent polycrystalline diamond
film as illustrated in Figure 3A, substantially transparent columns of
diamond crystals having a 〈110〉 orientation perpendicular to the base.Because of its high purity and uniform consistency,

<CLAIMS>
A die for drawing wire of a predetermined diameter comprising a CVD
diamond body characterised in that said body having a first surface in a region of larger diamond grains

and a second surface in a region of smaller diamond grains, an opening
extending through said body and having a wire bearing portion of

substantially circular cross-section determinative of the diameter of the
wire positioned more closely adjacent to said second surface in said

region of smaller grains than to said first surface in a region of larger
diamond grains.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said second
surface corresponds to an initial diamond growth surface.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
opening extends entirely through said body along an axial direction from

said second surface to said first surface, said body including diamond
grains having a 〈110〉 orientation extending substantially along the axial

direction.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 3 wherein said wire
hearing portion comprises a straight bore section having a circular cross

section.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 3 wherein said
opening tapers outwardly in one direction from said straight bore section

toward said first surface and tapers outwardly in the opposite direction
toward said second surface.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 5 wherein said
outward taper in said one direction forms an exit taper for the wire

and said outward taper in the other direction toward said first surface
forms an entrance taper.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 6 wherein said
entrance taper extends for a greater distance along the axial direction than

exit taper.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said body
has a thickness as measured from one surface to the other surface of about

0.3-10 millimeters. 
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
diamond is grown by chemical vapor deposition on a substrate selected

from the group consisting of Si, Ge, Mo, Nb, V, Ta, W, Ti, Zr or Hf or
alloys thereof.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 wherein said
diamond comprises a film of substantially transparent, translucent, or

non-opaque columns of diamond crystals having a 〈110〉 orientation
perpendicular to the second surface.
