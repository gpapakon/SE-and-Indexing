<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved machinery for handling plants or
seedlings in a prepared ground planting position, preferably from a nursery
growing container wherein plants are located in individual cells, the cells
being located in spaced rows. Conveniently, the machinery is adapted to
transfer and plant seedlings or plants from such containers with minimum
or no manual intervention required.Machinery of this general type is shown in Australian Patent No.
593066 where seedlings are transplanted from a cell chain in which they
have been initially propagated and grown. In many nursery operations,
however, seedlings are grown in rigid flat trays and it is also desired to
provide a mechanism for transplanting seedlings from such trays to a
prepared ground planting position. The provision of such machinery,
however, is faced with a number of practical problems. Firstly, it is
desirable to achieve fast transplanting speeds. Secondly, propagation of
seedlings is not always 100% successful and inevitably a number of cells in
a propagating tray will not hold a seedling or at least a viable seedling for
transplanting. It is of course desirable to avoid spaces in ground planting
positions caused by missing seedlings in the tray which then have to be
planted manually. Thirdly, it is desirable to avoid any discontinuities in
planting that might arise by the fact that indexing trays is necessarily not a
fully continuous process. Fourthly, it is desirable to avoid or minimize
transplanting errors that could arise by growth of seedlings flowing over into
adjacent cell regions of a propagating tray. Finally it is desirable to keep
the width of transplanting machines as low as possible and it is therefore
desirable to load trays in a vertical manner generally in the planting
direction which, however, necessitates reorienting the seedlings in some
manner so that they are not transverse to the planting direction of the
machine.Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention provides a field
seedling planting machine movable in a planting direction for transplanting 
seedlings propagated in seedling trays in a predetermined array of cells in
said trays, said machine including eject means for ejecting said seedlings
from the cells in a said tray either one by one or in groups so as to dispose
said seedlings in predetermined seedling holding means of a first conveyor
means, said first conveyor means being driven by first drive means so as to
move said first conveyor means and sequentially deliver said
