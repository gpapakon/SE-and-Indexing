<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder block for an internal combustion engine 
includes a bolt boss (6) located between cylinders, the bolt 

boss (6) being connected to a common wall portion (5) of a siamese 
bore wall structure by a double bridge structures including a 

lower bridge (11, 11', 11'') and an upper bridge (12) located 
above the lower bridge. Since a composite moment Eâ‚€ acting on 

the bolt boss (6) during the tightening of a head bolt is 
directed in a plane including the common wall portion (5), the 

composite moment can be born by the common portion (5) which 
has a very large rigidity in a direction perpendicular to the 

row of cylinder bores. As a result, deformation of the bolt 
boss (6) is suppressed, and deformation of the cylinder bore and 

inclination of the top deck are also effectively suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylinder block 
for an internal combustion engine, and more particularly, to 
a cylinder block structure capable of suppressing 
deformation of a cylinder bore and a gasket seal surface 
caused when fastening a cylinder head to the cylinder block. In conventional internal combustion engines, as 
illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 11, when a cylinder head 52 is 
fastened to a closed deck-type cylinder block 51 with a head 
bolt 53, a bolt boss 56 is pulled upwardly to cause a moment 
E1, E2 about a rigid grommet 55 of a head gasket 54 in a 
plane connecting a bore center and a bolt center and to 
cause deformations of the cylinder bore wall 57 and an upper 
deck 55. In this instance, intermediate cylinder bores 
cause a fourth-mode deformation and end cylinder bores cause 
a third-mode deformation as shown by the dashed line in FIG. 
11, and the upper deck 58 inclines inwardly and downwardly 
as shown in FIG. 9. The deformation of the cylinder bores 
increases piston oil consumption and piston slap noise. To suppress the cylinder bore deformation, various 
proposals have been made. For example, Japanese Utility 
Model Examined Publication SHO 59-24846 proposes a cylinder block 
shown in FIG. 12, wherein a cylinder block outside wall 61  
 
and a common wall portion portion 62 of a siamese bore wall 
structure are connected via a single bridge structure 63 on 
a side of an oil-ring of a piston to thereby suppress the 
fourth-mode deformation of the cylinder bore near the 
oil-ring, and no deck is provided above the single bridge 
structure to thereby cut transmission of a bending moment 
through the upper deck. However, there are problems with the conventional 
cylinder block. More particularly, although the cylinder 
bore deformation is suppressed, the upper end surface 64 of 
the cylinder block outside wall is inclined seriously by the 
fastening force of the head bolts 65 to cause a problem of 
seal. When the bolt boss 67 is pulled upwardly relative to 
the common wall portion located between adjacent cylinder 
bores, the cylinder block outside wall 61 falls inwardly as 
shown in FIG. 13. As a result, a gap g is generated between 
an upper end surface of the common wall portion and a lower 
surface of the cylinder head 68, through which gas will 
blow-by between adjacent two cylinders. Further, the 
inclination of the upper end surface of the cylinder block 
outside wall might cause leakage of cooling water and might 
decrease gasket durability. Furthermore, from the document
