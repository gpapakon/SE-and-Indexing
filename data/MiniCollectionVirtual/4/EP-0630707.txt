Method of producing a casting mould, such as
casting cores more especially, in a moulding box from a

moulding sand, which contains a gas-hardenable binder and
is poured into a hollow chamber of the moulding box from a

storage container through a sand supplying aperture in the
moulding box, whereupon the hardening fluid, which is

supplied in liquid form, dosed and gasified in this
quantity, permeates through the moulding sand for hardening

purposes, wherein subsequently reaction-free compressed air
rinses through the hardened casting mould to clear it of

gas, characterised in that the volume of the hardening
fluid, dimensioned in advance for a predetermined casting

mould, is supplied in liquid form to the moulding box or
into component parts belonging to said box and gasified in

the moulding box or in component parts belonging thereto,
and the gas produced there subsequently permeates directly

through the moulding sand to be gassed in the moulding box.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the gasification of the dosage is effected by supplying

energy in the moulding box or in component parts belonging
thereto.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that gas alone from the hardening fluid permeates through

the moulding sand in the moulding box for hardening
purposes.
Apparatus, more especially according to one of
claims 1 - 3, for hardening a casting mould, such as

casting core (2) more especially, from a moulding sand
containing a gas-hardenable binder, which apparatus

comprises a moulding box (1), the moulding sand being
pourable into the hollow chamber of said box through a

filler opening (6), said hollow chamber determining the 
casting mould, which filler opening is sealed by a gassing

plate (3) to accomplish the gassing process, a dozing
device for the hardening fluid and an arrangement for the

reaction-free compressed air used for gas rinsing purposes
being disposed in front of said gassing plate,

characterized in that the metering device is directly
associated with the gassing plate (3), and the gassing

plate (3) has an inlet (9, 10) for the liquid dosage.
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in
that the gassing plate (3) has a means (12, 13) for

supplying energy in order to gasify the liquid dosage.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in
that the gassing plate (3) is electrically heated.
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that, in addition to the inlet (9) for the liquid

dosage, the gassing plate has an additional inlet (16) for
the rinsing compressed air.
Apparatus according to one of claims 4 - 7,
characterized in that the spacing of the gasification duct

to be traversed between the inlet (6) for the liquid dosage
and the filler opening (6) for the moulding sand in the

moulding box (1) is multiplied in the gassing plate (3).
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in
that the gasification duct (11) in the gassing plate (3)

extends in a zigzag-shaped manner and is preferably
provided with evaporating ribs or the like.
