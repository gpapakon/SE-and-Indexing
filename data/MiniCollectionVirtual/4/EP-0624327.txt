<ABSTRACT>
A shelf (17) on a frame (18,19) sits within a tray-like 
structure provided by an intermediate frame (8), while the 

latter is supported by rails (6) and rollers (7). When 
pushed back into the storage position, the shelf (17) is 

stopped by a bar on the frame (8), with the rollers (21) on 
the shelf (17) at the rear ends of slots (12) in side plates 

(9) of the frame (8). The intermediate frame (8) is arrested 
by the outer framework (1). To gain clear access, the shelf 

(17) is pulled out horizontally, and it can shift with 
respect to the intermediate frame (8) a distance corresponding 

to the length of the slots (12). When it reaches the 
limit of this travel, the frame (8) is entrained and continued 

pulling draws it out, running on the rollers (7) and 
(13). The limit of its travel is defined by stops (not 

shown) but when achieved the shelf (17) is fully clear of 
the framework and thus fully accessible. To restore the 

storage position, the shelf is simply pushed in again.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pull-out shelf support
systems according to the preamble of claim 1. It is primarily concerned with such systems for use
in an industrial context, for example in racking for stores,
where hundreds of different items may be held, some of them
heavy and awkward to handle.Conventionally, such racking is provided by framing
assembled in rows with alleyways between. Fixed shelves have
their limitations, since if they are too deep, items get
lost at the back, or are, at least, difficult to see and
retrieve, particularly with high racking, a narrow alleyway
and top lighting.It is therefore better, unless only very shallow
shelving is required, to have pull-out shelves, bringing
items at the middle and towards the back of the shelf out
into the alleyway beyond the fixed framing. They can then be
seen and easily taken.However, the problem is that the shelf needs to be
supported when drawn out, and in order to provide sufficient
counteracting force to the tendency of the shelf to tip, it
is usual for there to be a limit on the horizontal movement,
leaving the rear portion of the shelf, perhaps up to one
third of the total area, still within the fixed framing.
Although this makes it better than fixed shelving, there are
still access problems. It is desirable to have the shelf
pulled out so that its total area is exposed.Certain lightweight structures, such as filing cabinets,
have solved this problem by the use of an intermediate 
runner at each side which travels by means of ball bearings
or rollers on rails fixed to the cabinet and which itself
provides ball bearing or roller support for a track on the
drawer to run on. As the drawer is pulled out, the runners
move with it, but travel half the distance.While these have proved satisfactory in that context,
scaling them up to support large shelves with heavy machine
parts on them is not practical.DE-U-8714720 discloses a pull out drawer system in
which there is an intermediate member at each side of the
drawer with rollers on that member and on the drawer and the
supporting frame arranged so that the drawer can be fully
pulled out while the intermediate members travel half the
distance. However, the intermediate members and the tracks
for the rollers are pressed steel strips configured so that
all the rollers at each side are in the same vertical plane
for space saving, and this gives them a weakness that makes
them unsuitable for heavy loads.It is the aim of this invention to enable a load
bearing member such as a shelf or drawer to be

<CLAIMS>
A pull-out shelf support system within a fixed
frame (1,2,3) comprising, for each side of a shelf (17),

   an intermediate member (8) for travel partially with
the shelf (17),

   first roller means (7) journalled at the front of the
frame to support the intermediate member (8),

   second roller means (13) journalled on the intermediate
member (8) and co-operating with a level track (6) provided

on or by the frame (1,2,3),

   third roller means (16) journalled at or near the
forward end of the intermediate member (8) to support the

shelf (17), and

   fourth roller means (21) journalled at or near the rear
of the shelf (17) and co-operating with a level track (12)

provided on or by the intermediate member (8),

   the arrangement being such that the roller means enables
the shelf (17) to run on the intermediate members (8) and

the intermediate members to run with respect to the frame
(1,2,3) and so that on pulling out the shelf (17), the

latter shifts with respect to the intermediate members (8)
while being supported horizontally thereby, and the intermediate

members (8) shift with respect to the frame (1,2,3)
while being supported horizontally thereby, 
characterised in
that
 each intermediate member (8) is an elongate plate in a
vertical plane, its lower edge bearing on the first roller

means (7), 
in that
 the level track (12) of the intermediate member is
a longitudinal slot in which the fourth roller means 

(21) runs bearing on the bottom edge or the top edge of the
slot depending on the balance of the shelf (17) and how much

it has been pulled out, and 
in that
 the second roller means
(13) extend from the outer face of the plate (8) and the third roller means

(16) extend from the inner face of the plate.
A system according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 each track on the fixed frame (1,2,3) comprises two
horizontal rails (6) one above the other.
A system according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the second roller means (13) is a wheel which runs
between the two rails (6), sometimes bearing on the lower

rail (when the shelf is pushed in) and sometimes on the
underside of the upper rail (when the shelf has been pulled

out a certain distance).
A system according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said
plates (8) form the sides of a frame underlying the shelf

(17), and which therefore moves with the shelf when that is
pulled out, although not to the same extent.
