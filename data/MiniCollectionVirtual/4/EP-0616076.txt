<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an immersion and suction moulding device for the production of packaging mouldings to be moulded out of cellulose and/or waste paper and/or board packaging wastes, consisting of an immersion tank (1) with a mould (5) which can be immersed in the immersion tank by means of a conveying mechanism (2) and displaced via an endless conveyor belt (4) running into a drier (3). According to the invention, such an immersion and suction moulding device is designed in such a way that a further immersion tank (1') with a mould (5) is allocated to the endless conveyor belt (4) at at least one of its free sides (6), and these are arranged so as to be displaceable to and fro between the laterally arranged immersion tank (1') and the endless conveyor belt (4). By this means, the throughput of such a device can be raised in a simple way to at least double.

<CLAIMS>
A dip and pulp moulder for manufacturing packing preforms to be moulded from fibre 
and/or paper and/or cardboard wastes, comprising a dip tank (1) with a pulp mould (5) 

immersible in the dip tank by means of a conveyor mechanism (2) and being adjustable 
via an endless conveyor belt (4) running into a dryer (3), characterized in that associated 

to the endless conveyor belt (4), on at least one of the free sides (6) thereof, is another 
dip tank (1') with a pulp mould (5), and that the latter reciprocates between the laterally 

arranged dip tank (1') and the endless conveyor belt (4). 
A moulder according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that arranged in a direction transverse to the endless conveyor belt (4) is 

guiding bar (7) with one or two mould holders (8) adjustable on the bar (7), extending 
across one or two of the laterally arranged dip tanks (1). 
A moulder according to claims 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the three dip tanks (1,1') are combined to form one dip tank (1") 

enclosing the deposit end (4') ofthe endless conveyor belt (4). 
A moulder according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the deposit end 
(4') of the endless conveyor belt (4) protruding from the dryer (3) is of a length (L) 

corresponding at least to the double width (B) of a pulp mould (5). 
A moulder according to any one of claims 2 to 4,
 
characterized in that another bar (7') is arranged ahead of bar (7) and in parallel thereto.
