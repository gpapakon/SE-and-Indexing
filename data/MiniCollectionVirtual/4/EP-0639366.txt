<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a hydroxyapatite cement useful in 
bone and tooth replacement, a calcium salt and a calcium 

phosphate are admixed in an aqueous solution of base, 
phosphate or organic acid capable of forming calcium 

ligand complexes, to deposit a hydroxyapatite cement, 
and/or the ratio of the total molar quantity of calcium 

to phosphate is in the range 1.3 : 1 to 1.8 : 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and to 
preparations for use in the production of hydroxyapatite 
cements which are useful in bone and tooth replacement. Hydroxyapatite [Ca₅(PO₄)₃OH] is a calcium 
phosphate compound and is the major mineral component of 
bones and teeth, and can be used to fill cavities in 
teeth, or as a bone implant. Hydroxyapatite can exist 
in a number of forms such as a powder or ceramic, but 
the cement is the most important in bone and tooth 
replacement. Hydroxyapatite cement is preferable to currently 
available biomaterials such as β-tricalcium phosphate, 
bioglass, biphasic calcium phosphate and polymethyl 
methacrylate (PMMA), because, in contrast to such 
materials, (1) it is highly biocompatible, (2) it sets 
to a hard mass with strength sufficient for many medical 
and dental applications, and (3) when implanted in bone, 
it resorbs and is eventually replaced by new bone tissue 
with no loss in volume or integrity. US-A-5 053 212 discloses a process for producing 
hydroxyapatite cement by reacting a powder comprising  
 
phosphoric acid crystals or monocalcium phosphate 
monohydrate with calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, 
calcium hydroxide or tetracalcium phosphate. However, 
the reactants have to be partially reacted during a dry 
milling process before water is added. US Re33161 and US Re33221 disclose processes for the 
production cements of calcium phosphate, including 
hydroxyapatite cements, which comprise reacting a powder 
comprising tetracalcium phosphate and dicalcium 
phosphate dihydrate or anhydrous dicalcium phosphate 
with water or extremely dilute solution of acid, base, 
or salt (of the order of 20 mM). The cements formed 
have good compressive strength (of the order of 34MPa). 
These hydroxyapatite cements have good invivo 
characteristics, in particular high biocompatibility and 
good osseointegration, but the setting time is of the 
order of 30 minutes, which is undesirably long. The present inventors have discovered that, if a calcium 
salt and a salt containing calcium ions and phosphate 
ions are reacted together in the presence of water, 
complete conversion to hydroxyapatite cement can be 
achieved if the ratio of the total molar quantity of 
calcium to the total molar quantity of phosphate is 
substantially in the range 1.3 : 1 to 1.8 : 1. This 
ratio ensures virtually complete conversion to 
hydroxyapatite cement without the formation of  
 
side-products in sufficient quantities to be deleterious 
to the final product. The present
