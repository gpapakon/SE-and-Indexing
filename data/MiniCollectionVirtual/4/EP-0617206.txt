<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a compliant nut (30) that can provide 
a more consistent compressive force to engine components by using a 

compliant section to absorb axial deflections. The present invention 
also provides a self centering feature that positions the nut upon 

compression, reduces thread stresses and prevents nut and shaft 
runnout. The invention consists of an annular member (68) having threads (32) 

on the inner diameter for mating with a threaded shaft and having a 
conical portion (60) extending axially and radially inward from the annular 

member for abutting engine components and the engine shaft. The 
nut (30) includes a plurality of exciter teeth (52) circumferentially disposed 

and extending radially from the annular member (68) used to provide shaft 
speed signal for engine controls and a plurality of axial spline members (54) 

extending axially from the annular member on the opposite face from 
conical section (60) for mating with torque applying tools and locking 

mechanisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nut used on a shaft to apply a
consistent compressive axial force on a plurality of components to
position the components and to self position itself to the shaft.In many applications, nuts and bolts are used to apply
compressive forces on multiple components, securing them in a
stacked relation. The compressive force through the components is
equal to the tensile force in the bolt which stretches proportionally to
the bolt length. A problem occurs when the bolt is placed in a hot
environment where it grows due to thermal expansion and relieves the
compressive force. This problem can be further compounded by
vibration which can help loosen the nut. This is particularly evident when
the compressive force is minimal because the friction holding the nut in
place is minimal. These detrimental conditions occur in gas turbine
engines and other applications and must be overcome because
securing the components is critical.In gas turbine engines, a nut is often used on the end of a
threaded shaft to secure and position engine components relative to
the shaft. The shaft traditionally has a radial flange extending outward
at one end to provide an abutting surface and threads for the nut at
the opposite end. The engine components are stacked along the shaft
such that the shaft extends through the center of the components. The
nut is threaded to the shaft to apply a compressive force through the
components which secures them in place relative to the shaft, and
thus, pilots the components.In some engines, such as the one in FIG. 1, the shaft is relatively
short, and thus, has little axial deflection when pulled on by the nut. This
presents several problems. First, different coefficients of thermal
expansion can make the thermal growth of the shaft greater than that
of the engine components during hot, operating conditions. Second,
the engine components are subject to dynamic radial forces which 
results in a Poisson axial contraction in the components. These
phenomena tend to relieve the securing force and pilot of the engine
components. Also, a large axial force is required to maintain the
engine components in compression which can create high stresses in
the nut threads. Because the shaft and nut threads are at an angle
other than 90 degrees to the nut and shaft centerline, the compressive
load tends to be unevenly distributed circumferentially on the engine
components and the threads tend to axially align at 90 degrees to the
centerline. Another serious problem is the entrapment of
