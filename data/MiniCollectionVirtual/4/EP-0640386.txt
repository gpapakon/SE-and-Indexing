<ABSTRACT>
Prodn. of mixed oxide powders contg., as main component, TiO2 in anatase form and, as subsidiary components, one or more of the catalytically active oxides MoO3, WO3 and V2O5, for mfg. deNOx catalysts, involves: (a) partially neutralising a sulphuric acid-contg. titanium dioxide hydrate suspension to pH 4-6 with alkali at 20-100  deg C; (b) filtering the suspension and washing the filter cake; (c) adding water-soluble Mo, W and/or V salt(s) in solid or dissolved form to the filter cake; and (d) drying and calcining at 300-750  deg C.

Process for the production of mixed oxide powders 
containing, as their principal constituent, TiO
2
 in 
anatase form and, as subsidiary constituents, one or 

more of the catalytically active oxides MoO
3
, WO
3
 and 
V
2
O
5
, for denox catalysts, characterised in that 

a) a titanium dioxide hydrate suspension containing 
sulphuric acid is partially neutralised with an 

alkali metal hydroxide solution to a pH value of 
between 4.0 and 6.0 at temperatures of between 20 

and 100°C, 
b) the suspension from a) is filtered and the filter 
cake thoroughly washed, 
c) one or more water-soluble salts of the metals Mo, 
W and V are added in solid or dissolved form to 

the filter cake from b) and 
d) the filter cake from c) is dried and calcined at 
temperatures of between 300 and 750°C. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the titanium dioxide hydrate suspension containing 

sulphuric acid which is used is a bleached hydrolysate 
suspension from the TiO
2
 production process using the 
sulphate process. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the bleached hydrolysate suspension contains 20 to 

40 wt.% of solids. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
sodium hydroxide solution is used as the alkali metal 

hydroxide solution.  
 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
filtration and washing in stage b) are performed in a 

rotary vacuum filter. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
drying in stage d) proceeds by spray drying. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the water soluble salts in stage c) are selected from 

the group comprising the ammonium salts of the mono- and 
isopolyanions of Mo(IV), W(VI) and V(V).
