<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method 
for charging viscous fluid which is capable of quickly and 
assuredly charging the viscous fluid into containers by a 
predetermined quantity for use in a charging and wrapping field 
for charging fluid into the containers. Hitherto, viscous fluid, for example, ketchup, mayonnaise 
or sauce, is charged into transparent containers by usually 
using a piston-type charger. In a charger 50 of the foregoing type, fluid in a fluid 
supply tank 51 is supplied to a measuring vessel 52 by a 
predetermined quantity to be measured. A delivery piston 53 disposed in the measuring vessel 52 
charges the fluid from a nozzle 55 into a container 57 
positioned on a table 56 via a pipe 54 (see Fig. 3). The fluid supplied into the measuring vessel 52 by a 
predetermined quantity is measured in the measuring vessel 52 by  
 
a so-called "capacity control method". Therefore, if the 
accuracy in the capacity of the molded container 57 is 
unsatisfactory (in particular, if the container 57 is made of 
glass), the fluid levels of the fluid charged into each 
container 57 by a predetermined quantity cannot be made the same 
among the containers 57. Therefore, the charged containers 57 
put on show in a shop, to the contrary to the fact, impress 
persons that the containers 57 are defective products of a type 
lacking for a predetermined quantity. Hence, the quality of the 
containers 57 deteriorates considerably. Therefore, the fluid levels in the containers can be made 
the same among the containers by employing a charging method of 
a type controlling the fluid level. An apparatus 60 adapted to the foregoing method, as shown 
in Fig. 4, charges the fluid into a container 57 through a 
nozzle 61 by gravitational drop or by pressure. When the fluid reaches a predetermined fluid level or 
immediately before the same reaches the predetermined fluid 
level, the supply of the fluid is stopped. Further, a suction 
pipe 62 inserted into the container port and having a suction 
port corresponding to the fluid level is used to suck up the 
excess fluid so that the fluid levels in the containers 57 are 
made the same. As a result, the foregoing problem has been 
overcome.  However, when the viscous fluid, is charged into the 
container by the gravitational drop method, unsatisfactory 
fluidity of the fluid passage caused from the viscosity of the 
fluid takes a too long time to complete the charging operation. Since bubbles can easily be mixed into the fluid at the 
time of
