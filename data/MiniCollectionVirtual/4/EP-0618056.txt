<ABSTRACT>
The method of producing a hollow article (10) of 
elastomeric material formed by at least two portions (16, 

22) having different cross-sections and/or axes oriented in 
different directions comprises the steps of moulding a 

first portion (22) of the article (10) in a first die, 
introducing at least a part (18) of the first portion (22) 

into an internal cavity (26) of a second die (24), and 
moulding a second portion (16) of the article (10) in the second die (24) as a 

continuation of the part (18) of the first portion (22) 
which is introduced into the internal cavity (26) of the 

second die (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a 
hollow article of elastomeric material formed by at least 
two portions having different cross-sections and/or axes 
oriented in different directions. Articles of this type may be, for example, the connecting 
elements used in the pneumatic, hydraulic or oleodynamic 
systems of a motor vehicle which are formed by several 
intersecting hoses, possibly of different diameters. Known methods of producing such articles provide for the 
various portions of the article to be moulded in separate 
dies and subsequently joined together. In order to carry out the latter operation, the ends of two 
portions which are intended to be adjacent one another in 
the finished article are fitted facing one another on a 
premoulded plastics sleeve. The latter is then placed in a further die into which 
molten elastomeric material is injected and, once it has 
set, acts as a moulded-on element joining the two ends 
which are fitted onto the plastics sleeve. The known methods thus have the disadvantage that they 
require an additional die for the moulding of the joining 
element. Moreover, in order to ensure success, it is 
necessary to carry out special treatments, for example, 
scraping and tackifying, on the end surfaces of the two  
 
portions to be joined to ensure good adhesion of the 
joining material. In order to avoid the problems mentioned, the subject of 
the present invention is a method of the type indicated 
above, characterized in that it comprises the steps of: 
moulding a first portion of the article in a first die, introducing at least a part of the first portion into an 
internal cavity of a second die, and moulding a second portion of the article in the second 
die, as a continuation of the part of the first portion 
which is introduced into the internal cavity of the second 
die.  
The method according to the invention thus requires neither the use of plastics sleeves or additional dies, apart from 
those necessary to mould the various elastomeric portions 
of the article, nor special treatments of the ends of the 
two portions of the article to be joined, particularly the 
part of the first portion on which the second portion is 
moulded. The method of the invention thus has the advantages, in 
comparison with known methods, that it requires less 
tooling and labour and that it reduces the cycle time 
required to produce a given article. According to a particularly convenient embodiment of the  
 
method of the invention, the part of the first

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a hollow article (10) of 
elastomeric material formed by at least two portions (16, 

22) having different cross-sections and/or axes oriented 
in different directions, the method being characterized 

in that it comprises the steps of: 

moulding a first portion (22) of the article (10) in a 
first die, 
introducing at least a part (18) of the first portion 
(22) into an internal cavity (26) of a second die (24), and 
moulding a second portion (16) of the article (10) in 
the second die (24) as a continuation of the part (18) of 

the first portion (22) which is introduced into the 
internal cavity (26) of the second die (24). 
A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
part (18) of the first portion (22) which is intended to be 

inserted in the internal cavity (26) of the second die (24) 
has a shoulder surface (20) for abutting a corresponding 

surface (36) of the wall of the cavity (26) of the second 
die (24). 
A method according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
first (22) and second (16) portions are tubular, in that 

the cavity (26) is formed by a main branch (28) and a 
secondary branch (30) which extends transversely from the 

main branch (28) and in which a male element (32) is 
 

disposed from which a pin (34) extends transversely into 
the secondary branch (30), and in that the part (18) of the 

first portion (22) is introduced into the secondary branch 

(30) of the cavity (26) of the second die (24) by being 
fitted onto the pin (34) which projects transversely from 

the male element (32). 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the first portion (22) has a 

projection extending from the part (18) which is intended 
to be introduced into the cavity (26) of the second die 

(24) for insertion in a corresponding recess in the wall of 
the second die (24) for securely achieving the correct 

angular orientation of the first portion (22) about its own 
axis. 
An article (10) of elastomeric material which can be 
produced by a method according to any one of the preceding 

claims.
