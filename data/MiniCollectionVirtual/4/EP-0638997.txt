<ABSTRACT>
The circuit comprises a variable gain amplifier (VCA) (71) supplied 
with a process signal (S55), a signal processor (72-74) for detecting 

and calculating the level of either the process signal or an output 
signal of the VCA and the level of a control signal (S56), and 

outputting a gain control signal (S60) in accordance with the level 
difference between them. A voltage output type amplifier (77) is 

switchable to either a normal operating state for delivering at its 
output terminal the gain control signal obtained from said signal 

processor or a signal interrupting state for retaining said output 
terminal at a high impedance state. A converter (78) converts the output 

voltage of the amplifier (77) into a current and voltage holding means 
(75) generate a voltage proportional to the current supplied thereto 

from the converter (78). The VCA (71) amplifies the process signal 
according to the output voltage of the voltage holding means (75). 
The servo circuit is adapted for controlling a 
variable gain amplifier to process an audio signal in a 

television receiver, a stereo apparatus or the like. 
When the servo circuit 

is formed into an IC configuration, a high-precision 
operating characteristic is attained merely by a bipolar-transistor 

manufacturing process to consequently minimize 
the number of required process steps, hence curtailing 

the production cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a servo circuit
and, more particularly, to a means for controlling a
variable gain amplifier to process an audio signal in a
television receiver, a stereo apparatus or the like.There is a known a servo circuit for controlling
the gain in a signal, which is to be processed, by
changing a control voltage or current supplied to a
variable gain amplifier (hereinafter referred to as VCA)
to vary the gain of such amplifier. Servo circuits are
classified into a closed loop type and an open loop type,
and a variety of methods and circuit configurations are
presently contrived for controlling a VCA.Now, a description will be given of a
conventional servo circuit in which gain variation is
reduced by the use of a switch circuit in a feedback path
of the closed-loop servo circuit.As shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying
drawings, there is known a servo circuit for controlling
the gain of a VCA by an output voltage of an integrator.
In such servo circuit, both the level of an input signal
to be processed and the level of a control signal are
detected and calculated, and then the voltage held by the
integrator is changed in accordance with the result of
such calculation to change the output voltage, thereby
controlling the gain of the VCA.During such gain control action, it is
occasionally needed to execute an operation of halting the
VCA gain variation in a certain state so as not to cause
any gain change in the VCA despite any level change of the
control signal. Such gain control can be achieved by
interrupting the current flowing in the integrator. More
specifically, when the input current is interrupted, the 
integrator holds the voltage at such instant, so that
the control voltage for the VCA is maintained at a
fixed value to thereby retain the gain of the VCA at a
certain fixed value.Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary
servo circuit based on the prior art. In this diagram,
there are included a VCA 31, a first level detector 32,
a second level detector 33, a calculator 34, an
integrator 35, and a switch 30. The switch 30 is
provided for interrupting an input current flowing into
the integrator 35. It has been generally customary in
the conventional servo circuit to employ a MOS FET or a
junction FET as the switch 30.Therefore, in manufacturing the servo circuit
of Fig. 1 by a bipolar production process, an additional
step of forming an FET for the switch 30 is required to
consequently raise the production cost. For the purpose
of averting such increase in the production
