<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a folded lens transmit-receive antenna and to a
system for transmitting and/or receiving electromagnetic energy comprising such an
antenna.With the expansion of satellite communications and the development of various
markets in that field, it has been a requirement recently for mobile satellite
communication systems to be developed. Those systems currently in use comprise
relatively expensive componentry and are typically beyond reach of the average
consumer. Antenna requirements for mobile satellite communication systems are quite
demanding and it has not been possible to produce an antenna capable of mobile
satellite operation at a cost effective price. In the development of AUSSAT-B satellite
system for Australia, it is anticipated that a mobile satellite communications antenna
would retail at approximately AU$2000. Other requirements are that a suitable antenna
should be of a size suitable for being readily fitted upon a vehicle roof. Also, due to
low height being a requirement which implies the use of a planar radiator, an antenna
used in the AUSSAT system is required to provide 12 dB of gain and must operate over
the elevation range 30° to 70° with a full 360° azimuth coverage. Planar phased array
technology can be used, and some development has proceeded in this direction,
however, the high cost of phase shifting elements makes a required low cost design
difficult. United States Patent No. 4,819,003 describes an antenna structure wherein a
wave generated by the feed in a lower parallel plate region has a cylindrical wave front,
centred on the axis of symmetry, leading to a wave coupled into an upper parallel plate
region that has a cylindrical wave front converging on the axis of symmetry. The
antenna structure described in said United States patent produces a fixed beam which
directly results from the formation of a curved wave front in the upper wave guide.It is an object of the present invention to provide folded lens transmit/receive
antennae and systems for receiving and/or transmitting electromagnetic signals, said
systems comprising such antennae.According to one aspect of the invention there is disclosed a folded lens
transmit/receive antenna comprising:
a first curved parallel plate waveguide;a second curved parallel plate waveguide;waveguide coupling means operatively associated with the first and second
waveguides for communicating a signal therebetween;free space coupling means for coupling a signal between the second waveguide
and free space, the free
