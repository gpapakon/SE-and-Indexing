<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a load-carrying vehicle, in particular a semi-trailer (100) with at least one load container (10) which is mounted on a set of running gear (11), has the purpose of receiving pressurisable goods and has at least one lower outlet (14) with which loading and unloading of the lorry can be carried out automatically independently of loading and unloading devices, it is proposed that the lower outlet of the load container (10) be designed as an inlet and outlet (14, 15) and be provided with inlet connections and outlet connections (16, 17) and with shut-off devices (18), and that the load-carrying vehicle has a device (21) for producing underpressure and excess pressure, which device (21) is connected to the interior (13) of the load container (10).

<CLAIMS>
Load-carrying vehicle, more particularly a semitrailer 
(100) with at least one load container (10) supported 

on a chassis (11) for the accommodation of 
pressurizable materials, which possesses at least 

one lower outlet (14), in which case the lower outlet 
of the load container (10) is constructed in 

the form of an inlet and an outlet (14,15) and is 
provided with supply and discharge connections (16, 

17) and with shutoff means (18) and the load-carrying 
vehicle possesses an apparatus (21) for the generation 

of negative pressure and positive pressure, 
which, while communicating with the interior (13) 

of the load container (10), is constructed in the 
form of a compressor (24) and evacuating means (25) 

connected to a driving means (23), the driving means 
being constructed in the form of an electromotor, 

internal combustion engine, hydraulic or pneumatic 
drive or suchlike and the lower inlet and outlet 

(14,15) is constructed along the lines of the so-called 
discharge udders known per se possessing 

the configuration of a cone, udder or funnel,
 
characterized in that
 
the load container (10) possesses two inlets and 

outlets (14,15) and is constructed in a self-supporting 
manner and in that the interior (13) of the 

load container (10) is provided with spraying nozzles 
which are connected with a cleansing unit (26), 

the spraying nozzles being at least partly supported 
on supporting arms that are movable in a pendulum-like 

fashion and/or rotatably and in that the 
cleansing unit (26) possesses a pressure pump for a  

 
cleansing liquid and/or a cleansing gas and communicates 

with a supply tank (27) for cleansing medium. 
Load-carrying vehicle according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the load-carrying vehicle is acapable of accommodating 

solid and liquid materials and mixtures of the 
same in a neutral form or in the form of hazardous 

materials drawn in by suction from below and can be 
emptied again without tipping and without thrust 

piston by means of pressure.
