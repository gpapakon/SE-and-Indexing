<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a method and device for performing 
sequential analytical reactions involving a first dry 

reagent and a second dry reagent comprised of two or 
more components having different rates of solubilization. 

The invention enables one to fully solubilize the 
components of the second reagent before they are 

brought into contact with each other to thereby avoid 
interference with the reaction kinetics which result 

when one or both of the components are not fully 
dissolved prior to their being brought into contact. 

The invention is especially useful in conjunction with 
immunoassay formats involving latex bound antibodies 

and polymeric agglutinators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analytical 
assay procedure for determining the amount of an 
analyte present in a liquid test sample. In particular, 
the present invention relates to the determination of 
an analyte in a liquid test sample involving analytical 
reactions between the analyte and one or more analytical 
reagents requiring sequential manipulative steps to 
make such determination. In United States Patent 4,990,075 there is disclosed 
a self contained analytical reaction vessel or 
device and method for performing analytical assay 
procedures involving sequential analytical reactions 
between an analyte in a liquid test sample and one or 
more analytical reagents which interact with the 
analyte to produce a detectable response as a function 
of the analyte. The device is described as being 
particularly useful for performing immunoassays which 
typically require a number of cumbersome manipulative 
steps such as pipetting, mixing and incubation of the 
liquid test sample with the analytical reagents.  More particularly, this device is described as 
comprising a closed container having a substantially 
horizontal axis of rotation and an analytical reagent 
reaction channel, liquid test sample delivery means for 
facilitating the flow of a liquid test sample into the 
reaction channel. The analytical reaction channel 
comprises one or more reaction zones incorporated with 
one or more analytical reagents in the dry form. A 
first analytical reagent is incorporated into the first 
reaction zone and a second reagent or reagents into the 
second reaction zone which is in liquid communication 
with the first reaction zone. A liquid test sample 
disposed in the reaction channel can be transported by 
gravity along the reaction channel between the reaction 
zones by rotating the device along its horizontal axis 
of rotation. This device works well when only one 
reagent is in the second reaction zone since after 
dissolution of the first analytical reagent the device 
is simply tilted to bring the reaction fluid into 
contact with the second dry reagent in the second 
reaction zone and allowed to remain in this configuration 
until the second reagent completely dissolves. 
However, in certain analytical procedures, there must 
be two or more dry reagents in the second reaction 
zone. When these reagents have different rates of 
dissolution, and are being dissolved simultaneously in 
the same fluid, certain problems are encountered. For 
example, if the dissolution rates of the two reagents 
ar
