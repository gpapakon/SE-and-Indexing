<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a transformer having a screen (S) between individual windings (w1, w2), at least one of the individual windings (w2) is formed from conductor tracks (b1, b2, ...) in a plurality of layers of a multilayer board (ML). These conductor tracks (b1, b2, ...) can optionally be connected together, to form different overall windings, via conductor links (D). By means of this design, a transformer can be used for a wide range of applications without costly storage and different quality tests being required. The growth of cracks is effectively suppressed by integration of the screen (S) in the multilayer board (ML).
