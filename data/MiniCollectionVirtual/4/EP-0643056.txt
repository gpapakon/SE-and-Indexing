<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 5-(1-hydroxy-2-urethaneethylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione derivatives, precursors of chiral tetramic acid derivatives. According to this process, an N-urethane-protected  alpha -amino acid N-carboxyanhydride is reacted with Meldrum's acid in an inert organic solvent medium in the presence of a tertiary amine. This process makes it possible to retain the chirality of the starting compound and in particular to simplify the synthesis of 4-amino-3-hydroxy acids and of their derivatives via the tetramic acids route.
