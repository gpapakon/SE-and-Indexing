<ABSTRACT>
A tunable digital oscillator circuit comprising a first dual-clock pulse generator (202), a second dual-clock pulse generator (204), a run controller (104), a stop controller (106) and a decoder (108). The first and second dual-clock pulse generators are coupled in a cascaded manner with the output of the first dual-clock pulse generator provided as an input to the second dual-clock pulse generator. Each of the first and second dual-clock pulse generators is preferably tunable, in that, they can output one clock signal from a predetermined number of frequencies. The run controller is preferably coupled to receive a start signal and the output of the second dual-clock pulse generator. The run controller provides the input to begin and maintain the first and second dual-clock pulse generators in the state of generating a clock signal. The stop controller is coupled to receive a clock signal from the first dual-clock pulse generator, and a stop signal. The tunable digital oscillator circuit can start or stop the clock within two clock cycles. The decoder receives a period select signal and provides a control signal to the first and second dual-clock pulse generators to select one of a predetermined number of frequencies for the clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
A TUNABLE DIGITAL OSCILLATOR CIRCUIT AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING CLOCK SIGNALS OF DIFFERENT FREQUENCIESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention.The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for generating clock signals. In particular, the present invention relates to a system and a method for generating clock signals of different frequencies using a tunable digital oscillator circuit. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a tunable oscillator circuit formed exclusively from digital logic circuits.2. Description of the Background Art.Oscillators are well known in the prior art for producing clock signals. Most conventional oscillators require some form of R-C network or resistor-capacitor combination. Such R-C networks are typically used in combination with a crystal to produce a well-defined, stable square wave output. However, one problem with such existing clock generators or oscillators is that they are difficult and expensive to include as part of an integrated circuit because of the required analog components. It is often very difficult, if not impossible, to make usable resistors and capacitors on integrated circuits, especially for certain design processes. Furthermore, the addition of such analog components to integrated circuits consumes much of the power and layout area of the integrated circuit, thereby reducing the overall amount of circuitry that can be put on one integrated circuit and increasing the cost of the die. Thus, there is a need for a system and method for producing a clock signal that does not require the conventional resistor-capacitor combinations.Modern integrated circuits often need not just one clock signal but several clock signals of differing frequencies. One common approach is to use a phase lock loop (PLL) circuit to provide a programmable frequency output. While PLL circuits provide very precise frequency output, they create a number of problems when included as part of an integrated circuit. First, programmable oscillators constructed using PLL circuits, while very good for many applications, are very sensitive to process technologies and must often be redesigned as process technologies change. This is a particular problem for integrated circuits where the process technologies are constantly migrating to smaller sizes such as the transition from .35 to .25 micron technologies. Therefore, each time the process technology changes the 

programmable oscillators must be redesigned Second, thev are expensive due to the
