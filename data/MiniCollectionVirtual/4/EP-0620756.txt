<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for gas particle formation in liquid media, and its application to gas particle formation in a liquid/slurry in mineral beneficiation apparatus is disclosed. A gas particle formation apparatus comprises an adjustable hollow stem (76) housed within a liquid chamber (78) having a liquid inlet (80) provided in the wall of the casing (82) thereof. The stem (76) is provided with an outwardly flared frusto-conical surface (84) having a circumferential edge defining an annular lip (86) on a head (90) of the adjustable stem (76). A portion (88) of the surface (84) is adapted to form a thin layer of gas thereon. The adjustable stem (76) is slidably mounted in the casing (82) with the surface (84) of the head (90) received in a circular aperture forming a liquid outlet in the casing (82), so that an adjustable annular gap (92) is formed between the surface (84) and a convex annular lip (94) of the circular aperture. Gas is delivered through distribution outlets (106) covered by a self-sealing resilient spreader (108) onto the surface portion (88) of the head (90). In use, both liquid and gas are forced through the gap (92) and as the gas layer escapes from the lip (86) it is broken into gas particles by shear forces. A mineral beneficiation apparatus incorporating the gas particle formation apparatus is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for gas particle formation in liquid media and 
relates particularly, though not exclusively, to aeration of 
a liquid/slurry in flotation apparatus. The method and apparatus for gas particle formation 
according to the invention can be used in any application 
requiring efficient aeration of liquid media such as, for 
example, aeration/oxygenation for biological waste liquid 
purification using aerobic micro-organisms, liquid/slurry 
preaeration and/or combined shear flocculation, liquid 
gasification and suspension of minerals or coal enrichment. 
The following description will be given with particular 
reference to gas particle formation and dispersion in a liquid/slurry 
in mineral flotation apparatus, however it will be 
appreciated that the inventive method and apparatus has much 
wider applications. Froth flotation is a process used for concentrating 
values from low-grade ores. After/during fine grinding the ore 
is mixed with water to form a slurry. Chemicals are added to 
the slurry to preferentially develop differences in surface 
characteristics between the various mineral species present. 
The slurry is then copiously aerated and the preferred 
(hydrophobic) mineral species cling to bubbles and float as a 
mineralised froth which is removed for further processing. It is well established that a key factor in the 
performance of the flotation technique is the size, volume and 
distribution of gas particles or air bubbles that can be 
dispersed into the slurry. The present invention was developed 
with a view to providing a method and apparatus for gas 
particle formation in which the desired size of gas particles 
can be readily controlled and a relatively uniform distribution 
of gas particles can be achieved irrespective of the gas flow 
rates required by the process. Several further improvements 
to flotation apparatus are also described.  
 According to one aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a method of gas particle 
formation in a liquid medium comprising the steps 
of: 
forming a substantially continuous film of gas 
on a surface having a discharge edge submerged in 
said liquid medium; generating a first flow of liquid over said 
surface, adjacent to and co-current with said film 
of gas, directed towards said edge; generating a second flow of liquid which 
converges with said first flow from the opposite 
side of said film of gas at said discharge edge; whereby, in use, the gas film is broken into 
gas particles
