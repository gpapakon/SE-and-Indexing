<ABSTRACT>
Vibration (oscillation) damper with an adjustable damping force, comprising a pressure tube which is filled with a damping medium and in which a piston on an axially movable piston rod (3) divides a working space into a space on the piston-rod side and a space remote from the piston rod, there being a flow of damping medium between the two working spaces (33, 35) which is divided into a main flow and a secondary flow, further comprising a damper valve assembly (1) consisting of a damper valve body, with one main-stage valve for each direction of flow formed by a respective main-stage valve body (21a, 21b) and with a pilot-stage valve which controls the main-stage valves, further comprising a controllable actuator which influences a flow connection between a control space (19) and a working space (33, 35), the control space (19) being bounded axially by the first and the second spring-loaded main-stage valve body (21a, 21b), the first main valve-stage body moving axially into the control space (19) towards the second main-stage valve body, out of the closed valve position into an open position, when acted upon by flow, which second main-stage valve body is held in the closed valve position by the damping medium. When the direction of incident flow is reversed, the second main-stage valve body is moved axially out of the closed valve position into an open position, in the direction of the first main-stage body, which is in the closed valve position.
