A process for cleaning objects soiled with fresh 
paint and/or lacquer residues using a hot lacquer remover, 

characterized in that the water-containing lacquer 
removal bath is regenerated by microfiltration, the bath 

liquid being passed in crossflow through a ceramic membrane 
without significant cooling, at a minimum flow rate of 2 m/s 

and with a minimum transmembranal pressure difference of 3 bar and 
the retentate being discharged. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the articles are cleaned by spraying. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that used containers for printing inks are cleaned to 

remove residues. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the articles are cleaned with an 

alkaline hot lacquer remover at temperatures of around 
90Â°C and higher. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the bath liquid is allowed to flow 

through the membrane surface at a rate of at least 4 m/s. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the articles are treated in several 

successive stages each with its own paint removal bath, 
the bath of the first stage is continuously or discontinuously 

regenerated by microfiltration, its permeate is 
added to the bath of the last stage and the bath losses 

are made up by the bath liquid of the following stage 
(cascade arrangement).
