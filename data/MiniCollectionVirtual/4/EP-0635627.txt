<ABSTRACT>
An improved converter body for carrying out chemical 
reactions, such as oxidation, and especially oxidation of 

pollutant materials in exhaust streams, which converter (122) includes 
an electrically heatable portion (90) characterized by a multicellular 

honeycomb monolith and an integral non-electrically heatable 
multicellular honeycomb "light-off" portion (92) each constructed of 

thin sheet metal layers. The electrically heatable portion (90) has a 
surface area of from 200 to 700 square inches and is capable of 

being rapidly heated to a temperature of from 400 F to 900 F in a 
period of from about 2 to about 40 seconds from a voltage source 

delivering at least 500 watts of power, and the electrically 
heatable honeycomb portion has a cell density of from 40 to 500 

cells per square inch. The "light-off" portion (92) has a surface 
area in the range of from 800 to 5000 square inches and a cell 

density of from 200 to 750 cells per square inch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a converter body, and more 
particularly to a converter body wherein a portion thereof is 
electrically heatable. The remaining portion is a non-electrically 
heatable "light-off" portion integral with the 
electrically heatable portion as will be described below. The 
converter body is characterized by a cellular metal honeycomb 
desirably formed of thin metal leaves or strips which are 
contained in a retaining shell. The combination of the metal 
honeycomb and the retaining shell forms a core which may then be 
placed in a housing. In one embodiment, the housing is adapted 
to be inserted in an exhaust line extending from an internal 
combustion engine, for example, to aid in the removal of 
pollutants contained therein. This invention will be described in connection with 
embodiments especially adapted for use in exhaust lines from 
various types of engines, e.g., internal combustion engines of 
the spark ignited or compression ignited types, stationary or 
mobile, or gas turbine engines. It will be understood, however, 
that the converters of the present invention may be used to 
effect various chemical reactions, particularly those occurring  
 
in fluid streams, especially gas streams, which reactions are 
catalyzed or uncatalyzed. Turning now to converters especially useful in exhaust 
lines extending from internal combustion engines, e.g., those 
used in automotive vehicles, the purpose of such catalytic 
converters is to convert pollutant materials present in the 
exhaust stream, e.g., carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, 
nitrogen oxides, etc., to carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water 
prior to discharge into the atmosphere. Conventional automotive 
catalytic converters utilize an oval or circular cross-section 
ceramic honeycomb monolith having square or triangular straight-through 
openings or cells with catalyst deposited on the walls of 
the cells; catalyst coated refractory metal oxide beads or 
pellets, e.g., alumina beads; or corrugated thin metal foil 
multicelled honeycomb monolith, e.g., a ferritic stainless steel 
foil honeycomb monolith, having a refractory metal oxide coating 
and catalyst carried on said coating and supported on the 
surfaces of the cells. The catalyst is normally a noble metal, 
e.g., platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, or a mixture of 
two or more of such metals. Zeolite coatings may also be used 
for the adsorption and desorption of pollutants to aid in their 
removal. The catalyst catalyzes a chemical reaction, mainly 
oxidation
