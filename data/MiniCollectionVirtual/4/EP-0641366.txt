<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing contaminants from PET components by depolymerising poly ethylene terephthalate ("PET") comprising transesterifying material containing PET by reacting ethanediol having a temperature at or about the boiling point of ethanediol with the material for a predetermined period of time to form a solution containing soluble short chain PET polymers and/or bis (hydroxy ethyl) terephthalate ester ("BHT"); recovering short chain PET polymers and/or BHT and ethanediol; and hydrolysing the recovered short chain PET polymers and/or BHT at elevated pressure and temperature for a predetermined period of time to form an ethanediol solution and crystals of terephthalic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates a method for the decontamination of poly ethylene
terephthalate ("PET").PET is a thermoplastic polyester that can be formed from
1,2-dihydroxyethane ("ethanediol") and terephthalic acid by direct
esterification to form bis (hydroxy ethyl) terephthalate ester ("BHT")
which is then polymerised by catalysed ester exchange to useful
polymers.Traditionally, PET has been used extensively because it can be offered
as an oriented film or fibre, has high tenacity, good electrical resistance
and low moisture absorption together with a melting point of
approximately 265 degrees Celsius.For these reasons, its uses have been very diverse extending from
being blended with cotton for wash and wear fabrics, blended with wool
for worsteds and suitings, packaging films and recording tapes and
containers including soft drink containers.There are a number of applications of PET where remelting and
reforming is not permissible or gives inferior properties. The reuse of
PET for these applications is best achieved by degrading the polymer
into the original monomers namely ethanediol and terephthalic acid then
reacting the monomers together to regenerate the original PET.The known art (British Patent No. 610135) is to hydrolyse PET with
either strong alkalis or acids. The alkalis must be neutralised with acid
to produce terephthalic acid resulting in a significant cost of reagents
and possible contamination of the product with alkali metal ions. The 
strong acids must be recovered and the ethanediol separated. Further
the acids dissolve paper and pigments to give by products which are
difficult to separate.It is known that PET will transesterify with ethanediol (British Patent
No. 610136) but the product BHT, is not a convenient intermediate for
subsequent purification to remove esters of contaminant acids such as
benzoic and adipic acid.Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an improved process of
decontaminating PET.Accordingly, in one form of this invention, there is provided a process
for removing contaminants from PET components by depolymerising PET
comprising the following steps:
(a) transesterifying material containing PET by reaction
with ethanediol having a temperature at or about the
boiling point of ethanediol for a period of time
sufficient to form a mixture containing embrittled
PET; and(b) crushing the mixture and separating crushed
material containing PET from uncrushed material.Further embodiments of the invention are set forth in the set
of claims attached to the
