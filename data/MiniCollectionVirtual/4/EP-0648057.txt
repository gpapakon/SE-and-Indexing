<ABSTRACT>
A standard definition (SD) corresponding image is 
derived from a high definition (HD) image by performing a 

vertical line sub-sampling for every field with a ratio of 
an odd number:1. One of the simple sub-sampling methods, 

the pyramidal coding method and the sub-band coding method 
may be used. For first fields, every third line is 

derived. For the remaining fields, every third line 
positioned at the center of the lines derived from the 

first field is derived by taking positional relation 
thereof on a reproduced image screen into consideration. 

As a result, it is possible to obtain an SD corresponding 
image having an unbroken interlace structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video signal 
processing method and apparatus in which a high definition 
(HD) video signal is processed after being divided into a 
signal which is suitable for reproduction as a standard 
definition (SD) video signal and a signal from which a HD 
image can be reproduced by processing it together with the 
SD video signal. Particularly, the present invention 
relates to a video signal processing method and apparatus 
suitable for deriving a video signal corresponding to an 
SD signal from a HD signal. The television broadcasting of HD image signals such 
as High-Vision is becoming more popular. The television 
broadcasting of SD image signals such as in the NTSC 
system is so widely used that such systems should continue 
for the forseeable future. In view of this, it is 
convenient that video devices such as a video tape 
recorder (VTR) is capable of handling images of both the 
HD video signal and the SD video signal. An image signal 
processing system has been proposed which is compatible 
with both the HD image signal and the SD image signal. In 
such proposal, a portion of a bit stream which is obtained 
by coding an image information of the HD signal is derived 
and decoded to obtain an image information of the SD image 
signal. Fig. 1 shows the basic construction of a known 
recording and reproducing apparatus which is capable of 
recording and reproducing both the SD image signal and the  
 
HD image signal. In Fig. 1, an HD signal Ghd is supplied 
to an encoder 10 in which an SD image signal Gsdh is 
derived from the HD image signal Ghd. The SD image signal 
Gsdh is supplied from one output of encoder 10 through a 
switch 12 to a recording and reproducing apparatus 14. 
The remaining additional image signal Ghdr appears at a 
second output of encoder 10 and is also applied to the 
recording and reproducing apparatus 14. When the SD image 
signal Gsd, also applied directly to switch 12, is to be 
recorded, the Gsd signal is supplied to the recording and 
reproducing apparatus 14 by switching the switch 12. In 
this case, the additional image signal Ghrd from the 
encoder 10 is not recorded. In the recording and reproducing apparatus 14, the 
input signals Ghdr and Gsdh (or Gsd) are recorded on a 
video tape, etc., separately. In reproduction, the HD 
image signal is reproduced by adding the additional image 
signal Ghdr to the SD image signal Gsdh, and the SD image 
signal is reproduced by decoding only the SD image signal 
Gsdh (or Gsd). As mentioned, the
