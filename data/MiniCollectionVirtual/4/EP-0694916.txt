<ABSTRACT>
In the method for fabricating a stamper for applying a 
photoresist (21) on with a major surface of a substrate (20) with plate 

configuration, exposing and developing the photoresist with the 
pattern corresponding to a signal to be recorded to form a 

concave/convex pattern composed of the photoresist on the major 
surface of the substrate and fabricating a stamper serving as a 

mold at the time of molding an optical disc based on the 
concave/convex pattern, the substrate itself is processed to be 

used as a stamper. Further, a positive-acting photoresist is 
applied on the major surface of the substrate formed to be quite 

smooth, parts of the photoresist other than parts corresponding 
to pits and/or grooves of the photoresist is exposed and 

developed to remain only the parts corresponding to pits and/or 
grooves of the photoresist, and the major surface of the 

substrate which exposes through the photoresist is etched to form 
each of parts of the substrate corresponding to the parts 

corresponding to the pits and/or grooves of the photoresist in 
convex configuration, thereby the stamper is formed easily and in 

a short time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for fabricating a 
stamper, which is suitable for, for example, fabricating a 
stamper serving as a mold at the time of molding an optical disc. Heretofore, this kind of stampers has been fabricated in 
accordance with the following processes shown in Figs. 1A to 1F. First, a positive-acting photoresist 2 is applied on one 
major surface 1A (hereinafter referred to as a super mirror 
finished surface) of a glass plate 1 which is polished to be 
quite smooth (Fig. 1A). Then, the photoresist 2 is exposed with 
a laser beam hν in order to record a signal thereon (Fig. 1B). 
Thereafter, the photoresist 2 is developed to thereby form a 
concave/convex pattern corresponding to the signal recorded on 
the photoresist 2 on the super mirror finished surface 1A of the 
glass plate 1 (Fig. 1C). Then, a conductive film layer 3 is formed on the surface of 
the concave/convex pattern by sputtering process, chemical 
plating process or the like (Fig. 1D). A plated layer 4 having a 
predetermined thickness is formed on the conductive film layer 3 
by electroplating process or the like (Fig. 1E), and then a  
 
stamper portion 5 composed of the conductive film layer 3 and the 
plated layer 4 is stripped off from the glass plate. Thereafter, 
the photoresist 2 etc., adhered to a pit surface of the stamper 
portion is washed away to obtain a stamper 6 (Fig. 1F). However, since the conventional method for fabricating a 
stamper for an optical disc (hereinafter referred to as a first 
method for fabricating a stamper) includes the chemical plating 
process and the electroplating process as described above, there 
arises a problem that a waste water treatment equipment for such 
a plating processing is required but such an equipment can not be 
established at an arbitrary area due to the regulation of 
effluent. As another conventional method for fabricating a stamper for 
an optical disc, a method for employing etching process 
(hereinafter referred to as a second method for fabricating a 
stamper) as shown in Figs. 2A to 2G has been proposed (Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 4-184727). Actually, according to the second method for fabricating a 
stamper, a positive-acting photoresist 11 is applied on a super 
mirror finished surface 10A of a glass plate 10 (Fig. 2A), and 
then the photoresist 11 is exposed with a laser beam hν in order 
to record a signal on the photoresist 11 (Fig. 2B). Thereafter, 
the photoresist 11 is developed to thereby form a concave/convex 
pattern
