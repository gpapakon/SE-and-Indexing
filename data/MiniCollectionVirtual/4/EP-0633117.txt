<ABSTRACT>
This device is intended for a two-stage mould. It comprises a device (21, 22, 24, 30) for transferring the label into the mould on opening the latter, constituted by a double set of belts mounted in closed loops and driven in substantially vertical translation between a magazine (10) and the inside of the mould, respectively a first set of two continuous belts called "pressing" belts (22) extending right up to the upper level of the female mould cavity (9) in question, and a second set of two belts called "holding" belts (24, 30), in close contact, at least temporarily, with the set of holding belts.
