<DESCRIPTION>
 DIARYL PIPERAZINOACETAMIDE COMPOUNDS AS ANTIMUSCARINIC AGENTSThe present invention is directed to novel diaryl piperazinoacetamide compounds useful as antimuscarinic agents. Typically, these compounds can be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, motion sickness and for the inhibition of gastric acid secretion.GENERAL BACKGROUND Other diaryl piperazinoacetamide compounds have been disclosed in the literature such as Chemical Abstract 113(7)59226h, 111(5)39321, and 81(5)25292g; and J^ Heterocvclic Chem. 20:1335-1338 (1983) and 20:1339-1349 (1983). None of the foregoing describe the novel compounds of the present invention.BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION Muscarinic receptors are one of two general types of cholinergic receptors and are distributed in the central nervous system and the peripheral organs. Inhibition of the effects of muscarinic agents at these receptors can produce the interruption of parasympathetic and sympathetic cholinergic nerve stimulation, e.g., decreased gastrointestinal motility, decreased gastric secretion, dry mouth, drying of the mucous membranes in general, mydriasis, loss of accommodation, urinary retention, decreased sweating and compensatory cutaneous flush. 

bronchial and biliary dilation, tachycardia and several central nervous system effects. Since some of these effects are desirable under certain circumstances, antimuscarinic agents, also known as muscarinic antagonists, have been developed in order to treat a wide variety of clinical conditions in the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, cardiovascular system, central nervous system, genito-urinary tract, in ophthalmology and in conjunction with anesthesia. Goodman and Gilman's The PharmacologicalBasisofTherapeutics, 8th ed. Pergamon Press 1990, incorporated herein by reference.For example, antimuscarinics have been used in the treatment of the following conditions: to dilate the pupil in order to facilitate visualization of the optic fundus and to paralyze accommodation; to break adhesion between the iris and lens; to treat acute iritis, uveitis, irdiocylitis and keratitis; to treat malignant glaucoma; preanesthesia medication to decrease excessive secretions; to treat sialorrhea, acute coryza, hay fever and rhinitis; to treat bronchial asthma; suppress vagally mediated bradyarrhythmias, heart block or cardiac syncope; to relieve urinary frequency and urgency; to control enuresis; to relieve ureteral colic; to treat functional gastrointestinal disorders; to treat motion sickness; to suppress gastric
