<ABSTRACT>
High glass transition temperature polyphenylene 
ether based compositions may be incorporated into 

immiscible polymer blends in order to obtain improved heat 
deflection temperatures. More particularly, high glass 

transition temperature polyphenylene ether base 
composition may be incorporated into polyamides in order 

to increase heat deflection temperatures while retaining 
solvent resistant properties, high impact strength and 

copolymer compatibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new compositions of 
matter and more particularly to immiscible polyamide blend 
compositions containing high glass transition temperature 
polyphenylene oxide based compositions incorporated 
therein. The resulting immiscible polyamide blends 
unexpectedly exhibit improved heat deflection temperatures 
(HDT) while retaining solvent resistant properties, high 
impact strength and copolymer compatibility. Polyethers and/or polymer blends which contain 
polyphenylene ethers (PPE) constitute an invaluable class of 
engineering thermoplastic resins. Resins of polyphenylene 
ethers are characterized by a unique combination of 
chemical, physical and electrical properties. For instance, 
they are resistant to many solvents and generally display 
high impact strengths. As a result of this unique 
combination of properties, resins of polyphenylene ethers 
are suitable for a broad range of commercial applications. It has been of increasing interest to prepare 
polymer blends which, while retaining their characteristic 
hydrolytic stability, dimensional stability and dielectric 
properties, have higher heat deflection temperatures. 
Particularly, there is a demand for immiscible blends, like 
polyamide blends, which possess increased heat deflection 
properties since they are, for instance, conventionally used  
 
in parts exposed to high temperatures in the automotive 
industry. Polymers are often blended in an effort to 
produce a combination displaying synergistic property 
improvements beyond those that are essentially additive in 
effect. The blends are commonly classified as being 
miscible or immiscible. Miscible blends may be defined as a 
polymer combination wherein the original identity of the 
component polymers is lost in the final blend. Conversely, 
immiscible blends consist of a matrix of polymers resulting 
in a structure composed of two different intertwined 
plastics in which each retains its own original physical 
characteristics. Several efforts have been made to increase the 
HDT values of miscible polymer blends. It has been 
discovered that utilizing PPE-based compositions of high 
glass transition temperatures (Tg), in lieu of alternative 
PPE compositions, results in miscible blends possessing 
increased HDT values. For example, miscible blends 
comprising xylenol and 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) 
copolymers and polystyrene have been shown to exhibit 
increased HDT values when compared to respective blends 
which incorporate a low Tg xylenol homopolymer.
