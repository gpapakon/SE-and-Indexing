<ABSTRACT>
A video on demand network (VODN) is proposed which 
transmits video signals (VS) to user stations (US11, .., 

US2N) pursuant to the receipt of control signals (CS) issued 
by these user stations. 
In order to optimize the retrieval costs, this 
video on demand network maintains a large video library in a 

central video server (CS) and stores locally popular video 
signals in a plurality of local distributed video servers 

(DS1/2) from which the latter video signals are transmitted 
to the user stations. The video signals provided by the local 

distributed servers are updated from the central server based 
upon the changing popularity of the video signals. 
The present invention proposes in particular to 
store the video signals in the local distributed servers in 

random access read/write memories (HDA), e.g. electronic RAMs 
and magnetic or optical disks, from which the video signals 

can flexibly be supplied on-line to the user stations and to 
store the vid
eo signals in the central server in sequential 
access memories, e.g. Digital Audio Tapes (DAT) and CD-ROMs 

(CDR), providing cheap mass storage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video on demand
network for transmitting video signals to user stations and
including at least one central video server storing a first
plurality of video signals, and a plurality of distributed
video servers each storing a distinct second plurality of
video signals and reading and transmitting selected video signals of
said second plurality to said user stations pursuant to the
receipt of control signals issued by said user stations
under instruction of respective users, said central server
transmitting video signals of said first plurality to said
distributed video servers in order to adapt said distinct
second pluralities based on said control signals.Hierarchical networks are already known in the art, e.g. from
the paper "Architectural design of on-demand video delivery
systems: the spatio-temporal storage allocation problem", by
R. Ramarao et al., Proc. ICC '91, June 1991, pp. 506-511.In the latter paper it is explained that the video on
demand service cannot be efficiently provided by a single
central server since the retrieval costs of the video
signals are in that case prohibitively large. Indeed, in
providing the service via this single central server to
geographically distributed user stations clearly resources
are wasted in transmitting the video signals over long
distances.Therefore a network of the above distributed nature is
proposed in which an optimization of the retrieval costs can
be made in function of the local popularity of the video
signals offered by the network. This known network further
is hierarchical in that the intermediate layer of
distributed servers is coupled to the lower layer of user
stations and to an upper layer which comprises the central
server. Thanks to these features the locally popular
material, i.e. the second pluralities of video signals, may 
be stored locally whereas the full video archive, i.e. the
first plurality of video signals, may be stored in a central
location from which the locally popular video material of
the second pluralities may then be updated dependent upon
demand.The above paper describes in particular how the video
signals should preferably be distributed over the various
layers but does not propose an architecture for these
servers. Known architectures, for instance the one described
in the paper "A store-and-forward architecture for video on
demand service", by Gelman et al., ICC '91, June 1991, pp.
842-846, cannot be used for the above distributed network.
Indeed, although this architecture includes a
