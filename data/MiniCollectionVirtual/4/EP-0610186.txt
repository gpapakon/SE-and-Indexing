<ABSTRACT>
In a process for controlled, multi-stage regeneration of FCC catalyst, a modified high efficiency catalyst regenerator (80), with a fast fluidized bed coke combustor (62), dilute phase transport riser (83), and second fluidized bed (82) regenerates the catalyst in at least two stages. The primary stage of regeneration is in the coke combustor (62), whereas a second stage catalyst regeneration occurs in the second fluidized bed (82). The amount of combustion air added to, and conditions in, the coke combustor (62) are controlled to limit CO combustion, while the second stage of regeneration, in the second fluidized bed (82), achieves complete CO combustion. Controlled multi-stage regeneration reduces steaming or deactivation of a catalyst during regeneration, increase coke burning capacity, and reduces NOx emissions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
regenerating spent fluidized catalytic cracking
catalyst.Catalytic cracking is the backbone of many
refineries. It converts heavy feeds to lighter products
by cracking large molecules into smaller molecules.
Catalytic cracking operates at low pressures, without
hydrogen addition, in contrast to hydrocracking, which
operates at high hydrogen partial pressures. Catalytic
cracking is inherently safe as it operates with very
little oil actually in inventory during the cracking
process.There are two main variants of the catalytic
cracking process: the moving bed process and the far
more popular and efficient fluidized bed process.In the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process,
catalyst circulates between a cracking reactor and a
catalyst regenerator. In the reactor, hydrocarbon feed
contacts a source of hot, regenerated catalyst, which
vaporizes and cracks the feed at a temperature of
425-600째C, usually 460-560째C. The cracking reaction
deposits carbonaceous hydrocarbons or coke on the
catalyst, thereby deactivating the catalyst. The
cracked products are separated from the coked catalyst,
which is then stripped of volatiles, usually with steam,
in a catalyst stripper. The stripped catalyst is then
passed to the catalyst regenerator, where coke is burned
from the catalyst with oxygen containing gas, usually
air. Decoking restores catalyst activity and
simultaneously heats the catalyst to, for example,
500-900째C, usually 600-750째C. This heated catalyst is
recycled to the cracking reactor to crack more fresh
feed. Flue gas formed by burning coke in the 
regenerator may be treated for removal of particulates
and for conversion of carbon monoxide, after which the
flue gas is normally discharged into the atmosphere.Catalytic cracking has undergone progressive
development since the 1940s, with the trend in fluid
catalytic cracking being towards all riser cracking and
use of zeolite catalysts.Riser cracking gives higher yields of valuable
products than dense bed cracking. Most FCC units now
use all riser cracking, with hydrocarbon residence times
in the riser of less than 10 seconds, and even less than
5 seconds.Zeolite-containing catalysts having high activity
and selectivity are now used in most FCC units. These
catalysts work best when coke on the catalyst after
regeneration is less than 0.2 wt %, and preferably less
than 0.05 wt %.To regenerate FCC catalysts to these low residual
carbon levels, and to burn CO completely to CO2 within
the regenerator (to conserve heat and

<CLAIMS>
A process for regenerating spent fluidized
catalytic cracking catalyst comprising the steps

of:

a) partially regenerating said spent cracking
catalyst in a primary regeneration zone,

comprising a fast fluidized bed coke combustor
and a superimposed dilute phase transport

riser, by charging said spent catalyst to said
fast fluidized bed coke combustor having an

inlet for spent catalyst, an inlet for
recycled regenerated catalyst and an inlet for

primary regeneration gas, to produce partially
regenerated catalyst and flue gas comprising

at least 1.0 mole % CO, which are passed up
into the dilute phase transport riser and

discharged therefrom to form a flue gas rich
stream comprising at least 1 mole % CO and a

catalyst rich stream comprising partially
regenerated catalyst; and
b) completing the regeneration of said partially
regenerated catalyst in a secondary

regeneration zone comprising a second
fluidized bed adapted to receive said

partially regenerated catalyst and having
means for adding additional regeneration gas

to said second fluidized bed in an amount
sufficient to complete the regeneration of

said catalyst and produce regenerated catalyst
and secondary flue gas; wherein:


i) the CO-containing flue gas stream from
the said dilute phase transport riser is

combined with said secondary flue gas to
produce a combined flue gas stream; 
ii) the conditions in said secondary
regeneration zone are controlled such

that said secondary flue gas contains
less than 1 mole % CO and contains

sufficient oxygen to react with the
CO-containing flue gas stream from the

said dilute transport riser;
iii) at least one flue gas composition or a
differential temperature in said combined

flue gas stream is monitored; and
iv) the amount of primary regeneration gas
supplied to said fast fluidized bed coke

combustor is controlled so as to maintain
constant said monitored flue gas

composition or differential temperature.
The process of claim 1 wherein said second
fluidized bed comprises a bubbling dense phase

fluidized bed.
The process of claim 1 wherein a cyclone separator
connected to said dilute phase transport riser

outlet is used to separate partially regenerated
catalyst from flue gas.
The process of claim 1 wherein the amount of
primary regeneration gas supplied to said fast

fluidized bed coke combustor and the amount of
additional regeneration gas supplied to said second

fluidized bed are controlled so as to maintain
constant said monitored flue gas composition or

differential temperature. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the amount of
regenerated catalyst recycled to the coke combustor

from the second fluidized bed is controlled to
limit the amount of coke burned in said coke

combustor to 10 to 90 % of the coke on said spent
catalyst.
