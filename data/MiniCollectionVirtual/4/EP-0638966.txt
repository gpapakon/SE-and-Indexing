<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telephone line three-pole 
terminal jack fitted in a box of the conventional type and 
comprising in addition to the three contacts of a three-pole 
telephone jack also thermal protection devices, a remote 
line sectioning device, and the terminals for the output 
signal.
 
In case of a phone service providing wired radio and/or remote 
counter readout or other services, the telephone line 
three-pole terminal jack is provided with a device comprising 
the terminals for the additional service and three 
contacts for a three-pole telephone plug. At the present state of art the new standard telephone line 
terminal jack provided by the Italian Phone Service Company 
is formed of two separate sections: one section dedicated to 
the remote sectioning device, the protection components, and 
the terminals for the connection of additional services such 
as wired radio or remote counter readout, and a second section 
containing the three telephone contacts for a telephone 
plug and having the construction and the function of the 
conventional telephone line three-pole terminal jack.
 
The separation between the parts accessible to the Phone 
Service Company and the parts accessible to the user is assured 
at present by sealing a portion of the first section. 
Users can connect their equipment to the line downstream of  
 
such sealed section.
 
Such system has a number of problem both of technical and 
merely economical type. In fact it is known that the demand 
of additional telephone services (such as remote counter 
readout and wired radio) does not exceed 7-8% of the users 
so that most telephone sets have a telephone line three-pole 
terminal jack including devices which are not actually used. 
The useless presence of such devices means not only a waste 
regarding the cost and the available room but also assembling 
problems and above all a lower operation reliability.
 
To this end it should be appreciated that the installation 
of the remote sectioning device (included in the new standard 
terminal jack mentioned above) at the user, as specifically 
described in the Patents RM 91A 000642 and RM 92 A 
000230, has the main purpose of actuating a sectioning of 
the line at the user so as to check the state of the line 
and to avoid the intervention of the technical staff on 
site.
 
According to this solution which actually solves the problem 
of automatically checking the state of the line without 
using technical staff at the user, the given solution with 
the present

<CLAIMS>
Telephone line three-pole terminal jack, wherein it includes 
two sections having separate function and construction, 

one section (31) which would be sufficient for the 
connection to the telephone line including a remote sectioning 

device (25), the protection devices (23, 24), the 
output terminal (29, 30) to the user, and the three terminals 

(26, 27, 28) for the three-pole telephone plug, the 
second section (40), necessary only in case of the presence 

of wired radio and/or remote counter readout, being connectable 
to the first section and including the terminals (32, 

33, 34, 35) for the services to be connected, the three terminals 
(33, 36, 39) for the three-pole telephone plug, and 

the output terminals (37, 38). 
Telephone line three-pole terminal jack according to 
claim 1, characterized in that a printed board (2) including 

the remote sectioning device (25) and a base for protecting 
and supporting the printed board (2) are arranged in the 

rear part of jack (3) forming the box of the section of the 
standard telephone line terminal jack (31). 
Telephone line three-pole terminal jack according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the addition of the section 

 
(40) of any supplementary services is carried out by a simple 

connection of the input terminals (32, 34) of such section 
(40) to the terminals downstream of the remote sectioning 

device (25) with the result of the connection of the 
terminals (33, 36, 39) for the three-pole telephone plug of 

block (40) and disconnection of the corresponding terminals 
(26, 27, 28) of block (31).
