<ABSTRACT>
The slider has leading and 
trailing edges (11a,11b) and substantially parallel sides 

has a pair of side rail members (12,13) and a two segment 
center rail member (14). The side rail members (12,13) 

extend on the slider from the leading edge (11a) to a 
position which is less than the distance between the leading 

edge (11a) and the trailing edge (11b), while the center 
rail member (14) extends to the trailing edge (11b) from the 

leading edge (11a). This structure permits near or pseudo-contact 
between a transducer (16) located on the trailing 

edge (11b) and a magnetic recording disk over which the 
slider flies.

<DESCRIPTION>
Copending U.S. patent application Serial Number 07/982,853 
filed November 30, 1992, discloses magnetic head sliders having 
air bearing surfaces with configured rails. Copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/024,476, 
filed March 1, 1993, discloses a head slider having a "wishbone" 
shaped center rail member which reduces or eliminates the 
possibility of stray particles becoming trapped between the 
slider and the disk. This application is incorporated herein by 
reference. This invention relates to air bearing magnetic head sliders 
used in disk drives and in particular to head sliders with 
configured air bearing surfaces. A magnetic recording head assembly used in a disk drive 
typically incorporates an air bearing slider carrying at least 
one magnetic transducer that flies over the surface of a magnetic 
disk for transducing data signals. One objective for improving 
the transducing relationship between the magnetic transducer and 
the magnetic disk is to provide a low flying height or very close 
spacing between the transducer and the disk during operation of 
the disk drive. When used with very narrow transducing gaps and 
very thin magnetic films, the close spacing allows high density 
signals to be recorded, thereby producing high storage capacity 
recording. It is also desirable to maintain a substantially 
constant flying height and a tightly controlled pitch of the 
slider relative to the disk surface so that the signal being 
processed from the transducer is accurate. To realize controlled 
pitch and constant flying height, pitch stiffness of the air  
 
bearing slider must be controlled. In accordance with the present invention, a variety of 
slider structures are provided which represent an improvement 
over the above identified wishbone structure of Serial No. 
08/024,476 in providing for closer spacing between the disk and 
the trailing edge of the slider which carries the transducer. The sliders disclosed herein may be described by the 
following:
 
   There are four air bearing surfaces which reside 
substantially in the same plane. Three of these air bearing 
surfaces have leading edge tapers, each taper having the same 
nominal angle in the range of 10 to 120 minutes of arc. The 
surface without a leading edge taper is intended to carry the 
active transducer. At most, two of the air bearing surfaces 
reach the trailing edge, and the transducer-bearing surface 
always reaches the trailing edge. The length of the slider body is nominally between .030 and 
.112 inches, and

trailing edges (11a, 11b) and substantially parallel sides, 

said slider including a nonmagnetic substrate (11), said 
slider comprising: 

   a pair of side rail members (12, 13) and a center rail 
member (14), said side rail members (12, 13) extending 

on said slider from said leading edge (11a) to a 
position which is less than the distance between said 

leading edge (11a) and said trailing edge (11b), said 
center rail member (14) extending to said trailing 

edge (11b) from said leading edge (11a).
