<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ground-handling tractor (7) (towing vehicle) for towing an aircraft without a towbar, which, by accommodating an addition weight (1) is made able to recover, for example, an aircraft which has come off the runway by means of a towbar which is articulated on the coupling (8) of the additional weight (1), which additional weight (1) is provided with a centre pole (3), is accommodated on the lifting blade (8) of the aircraft ground-handling tractor (7) and is secured there.

Method of recovering aeroplanes, 
transport vehicles and operational vehicles using 

a towing vehicle having a wheeled chassis and its 
own drive for manoeuvring an aeroplane without a 

tow rod, the vehicle having an open, approximately 
U-shaped recess with a clamping and lifting device 

arranged therein for the nose landing gear of the 
aeroplane, characterised in that the towing 

vehicle (7) is equipped with an additional weight 
(1) in the form of a metallic cylinder which is 

fitted onto a shaft (2) and which has a tow bar 
(3) and a co
upling (6) for the attachment of a tow 
rod, or a similar towing means, which is 

accommodated by the clamping and lifting device. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the cylindrical additional 

weight (1) as a solid body may have, at a maximum, 
a weight corresponding to the permissible nose 

wheel load for the relevant type of towing 
vehicle. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the cylindrical additional 

weight (1) is a hollow body filled with filling 
material, it being possible for the total weight  

 
of the cylinder to correspond, at a maximum, to 

the permissible nose wheel load for the relevant 
type of towing vehicle. 
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a spur wheel (4) which can 

be lifted and lowered is arranged below the tow 
bar (3). 
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the surface of the 

additional weight (1), that is to say, of the 
solid or hollow cylinder, is coated with rubber or 

a rubber-like material. 
Method according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the towing vehicle (7) 

equipped with the cylindrical additional weight 
(1) is, if necessary, a manoeuvring vehicle for 

aeroplanes.
