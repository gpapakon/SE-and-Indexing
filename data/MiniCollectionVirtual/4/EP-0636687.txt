<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns hydrotropes (or hydrotropic 
agents), ie substances which will solubilise a surfactant 
in an aqueous solution of an electrolyte without 
significantly altering the surface active properties of 
the surfactant, and relates to a novel class of 
hydrotropes and their use in aqueous compositions, 
particularly cleaning compositions. Many liquid cleaning products contain electrolytes (such 
as phosphates, silicates, hypochlorites etc), and also 
surfactants, which are typically included for their 
detergency and wetting properties. Many surfactants are 
insoluble in the electrolytes at the concentrations used, 
and hydrotropes are employed to assist in the formulation 
and stabilisation of many liquid cleaning products. For 
example, hydrotropes are currently used in products such 
as liquid detergents, multi-surface cleaners, automatic 
and manual dishwashing detergents, and all-purpose 
cleaning products. Hydrotropes are generally low molecular weight compounds, 
often with an amphiphilic character, having both 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups. Examples  
 
of materials currently used as hydrotropes include sodium 
xylene sulphonate (SXS or NXS), phosphate esters and alkyl 
polyglycosides. For further information on hydrotropes see, for example, 
J. Dispersion Science and Technology, 9 (5 + 6), 443-457 
(1988-89), J. Dispersion Science and Technology, 9 (2), 
149-169 (1988) and Speciality Chemicals, 376-378 (1991). The present invention is based on the discovery that 
certain polymers can function as hydrotropes. According to the present invention there is provided an 
aqueous composition, comprising electrolyte, surfactant 
and polymeric hydrotrope. The polymer may be a homopolymer or a copolymer, and 
preferably comprises hydrophilic and hydrophobic 
monomers. The hydrophilic monomer is preferably selected from group: 
acrylic acid and substituted acrylic acids, eg. 
methacrylic acid, maleic acid and half-esters thereof, 
crotonic and itaconic acids and other alkene carboxylic 
acids and their derivatives, carboxylated styrene, 
sulphonated styrene, ethylene sulphonic acid, and certain 
nitrogen-based monomers eg acrylamide, vinyl pyrollidone, 
and mixtures of such hydrophilic monomers. The hydrophobic monomer is preferably selected from the 
group: styrene and substituted styrenes, eg. alpha-methyl 
styrene, alpha-olefins, eg. C₁₂-alpha-olefin, vinyl  
 
ethers, eg. butyl vinyl ether; allyl ethers, eg. butyl 
allyl ether; unsaturated hydrocarbons, eg ethylene, 
prop
