<ABSTRACT>
A bias circuit for applying a bias voltage to an 
avalanche photodiode APD2 for detecting light comprises a 

first diode APD1, a power supply V
H
 connected to the first 
diode APD1, for applying a voltage to make the diode in 

breakdown between an anode and a cathode of the first 
diode APD1, and a constant voltage circuit V2 connected 

to the avalanche photodiode APD2 for detecting light, for 
applying a voltage difference of a breakdown voltage 

generated between the anode and the cathode of the first 
diode APD1 minus a constant voltage to the avalanche 

photodiode. The constant voltage is substantially 
independent from current flowing in the avalanche 

photodiode APD2 for detecting light to the avalanche 
photodiode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photodetecting
circuit.An avalanche photodiode (APD) is a semiconductor
photodetector which has high photodetection sensitivity
and high speed of response utilizing the avalanche
multiplication. The APD is used to perform the
photodetection with high sensitivity. However, each
APD has an operating characteristic which varies
according to temperature during operation. As a
temperature compensating circuit for the APD, circuits
disclosed in "Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Shou 60-111540
(111540/1985)", "Japanese Patent Laid-open No.
Shou 60-180347 (180347/1985)", and "Japanese Patent
Laid-open No. Hei 2-44218 (44218/1990)" have been
known.The inventors of the present application found the
fact that the difference between the voltage at which
the APD showed a constant multiplication factor and the
breakdown voltage was substantially constant. The
present invention was developed based on this
discovery.In the case of using a circuit embodying the
invention, the photodetection can be performed with
higher stability to temperature as compared with a
conventional circuit which is disclosed in "Japanese
Patent Laid-open No. Hei 2-44218 (44218/1990)" (see
Fig. 5-Fig. 8).According to the present invention there is
provided a photodetecting circuit comprising: a second
avalanche photodiode for detecting light, and a bias
circuit for applying a bias voltage to the avalanche
photodiode, characterised in that the bias circuit 
comprises: a first avalanche photodiode having similar
temperature dependent characteristics to those of the
first avalanche photodiode and being operable in
breakdown at a breakdown voltage; a constant voltage
circuit arranged with the first and second avalanche
photodiodes so as to apply to the second photodiode a
voltage equal substantially to the breakdown voltage
minus the constant voltage.Embodiments of the invention may comprise a first
APD, a power supply connected to the first APD, for
applying a voltage between an anode and a cathode of
the first APD to make the first APD in breakdown,
and a constant voltage circuit connected to the second APD (i.e.
the avalanche photodiode for detecting light), for applying
a voltage difference of a breakdown voltage generated
between the anode and the cathode of the first APD
minus a constant voltage to the second APD.
The constant voltage is substantially independent from
current flowing in the second APD.In view of temperature compensation (compensation
for the temperature dependence of the APD gain versus
voltage
