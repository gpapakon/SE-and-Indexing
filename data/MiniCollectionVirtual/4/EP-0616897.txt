<ABSTRACT>
A heat-sensitive recording material comprises a heat-sensitive 
color forming layer which is formed on a supporter and contains a 

colorless or light color leuco dyestuff as a color forming substance, a 
developer which develops color of the leuco dyestuff by reaction with it 

when heated and a sensitizer. The developer is 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
having purity of 97 weight % or more and prepared by 

washing and drying crystal which is obtained by dissolving crude 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
in an alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or in 

a mixture of an alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and water by heating 
and then cooling the solution or partially removing the solvent from the 

solution by distillation. The heat-sensitive recording material has 
excellent properties, such as reduced fog and excellent image 

preservation (weatherability).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing a heat-sensitive recording
material. Moreover particularly, it relates to a process for preparing a heat-sensitive
recording material showing reduced fog and improved image preservation.Recently, heat-sensitive recording materials comprising a heat-sensitive
color forming layer coated on a supporter, such as paper,
synthetic paper, plastic film or the like, have widely been used in
thermal printers of facsimiles, electronic calculators, microcomputers
and the like, in thermo-pen recorders of cardiograph, analytical
instruments and the like, as train tickets, POS labels in super markets
and the like, and in the like other applications.These heat-sensitive recording materials are generally produced
by first preparing a coating fluid, then coating the fluid on a support
such as paper and drying to form a heat-sensitive color forming layer.
For the preparation of the coating fluid, a colorless or light color leuco
dyestuff of a lactone, a lactam, a spiropyran or the like as a color forming
substance and a developer which develops color of the color forming
substance by reaction with it when heated are separately pulverized with
a ball mill or a sand mill and dispersed in a medium. The dispersions
are mixed together with addition of a binder to prepare a coating fluid.
Wax, sensitizers, surface active agents, defoaming agents, inorganic 
pigments and the like may be added to the mixed dispersion according to
necessity.As a developer showing good image preservation, 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone
or 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone is used in
JP-A 1982-15099 and 1988-3991.However, these compounds show inferior heat response and sufficient
color density cannot be obtained. To solve this problem, a sensitizer is
generally added to the developer to lower the color forming temperature.
Examples of the sensitizer currently used for such purpose are paraffin
wax, amides, such as fatty acid amides, esters, such as dimethyl
terephthalate, and ethers. However, these sensitizers often have
the drawbacks that they do not always provide a sufficiently high color
forming density, color forming sensitivity and reduced fog and that
image preservation is poor to result in deterioration of the image with
time even when an image of high density can be obtained. Thus, no
sensitizer having satisfactory properties has heretofore been obtained.EP-A-0251209 discloses a heat-sensitive material which comprises a support and a heat
sensitive color forming layer containing a
