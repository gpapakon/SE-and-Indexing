<ABSTRACT>
The woven lace of the invention is composed:     a) of columns (1) formed by woven warp threads (5), b) of proximity loops (2) connected to one another in a suitable way along the said columns (1) by means of weft threads (6),   c) of visible holes (3) and (4) of predetermined form, d) of pile threads (8), if appropriate napped, which are interlaced and arranged along the said columns (1), in such a way that they are projected towards the outside of the said columns (1), e) and, if appropriate, interlaced elastic threads (9) along the said columns (1).   A preferred method involves:   a) interlacing along the columns (1) in the extension of the elastic threads (9), b) interlacing pile threds (8), whilst producing a part (8a) intended to be converted into piles along the said columns (1) and towards the outside of the said columns (1), but without the said part (8a) being interlaced with the said columns (1), c) taking advantage of the shrinkage of the elastic threads (9) after weaving, converting the said part (8a) into piles (10) formed on the side of the said columns (1).

Knitted lace composed:

of columns (1) formed by knitted warp threads (5),
of proximity loops (2) suitably connected to one
another along the said columns (1) by means of weft

threads (6),
of visible holes (3) and (4) of predetermined shape,
of elastic threads (9) interlaced along the said
columns (1) and capable of lengthening or of retracting

in the longitudinal direction of the threads, 
characterized
in that
 it comprises, furthermore, pile (10)
threads (8) interlaced and arranged along the said

columns (1) so that pile (10) is formed that is
projected towards the outside and along the said columns

(1), said pile making it possible to improve the quality
of feel and the capacity for absorbing transpiration of

the lace.
Knitted lace according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the projections formed towards the outside by the
pile threads (8) are teased.
Method for the production of a knitted lace
composed of columns (1) formed by knitted warp threads

(5), of proximity loops (2) suitably connected to one
another along the columns (1) by means of weft threads

(6), and of visible holes (3) and (4) of predetermined
shape and of elastic threads (9) interlaced along the

said columns (1) and capable of lengthening or of
retracting in the longitudinal direction of the threads,


characterized in that
 it involves, in order to improve 
the quality of feel and the capacity for absorbing

transpiration of the lace:

a)interlacing the extended elastic threads (9) along the
said columns (1),
b)interlacing pile threads (8), whilst producing a part
(8a) intended to be converted into pile, along the said

columns (1) and towards the outside of the said columns
(1), but without the said part (8a) being interlaced

with the said columns (1),
c)converting, by utilizing the retraction of the elastic
threads (9) after knitting, the said part (8a) into pile

(10) formed on the lateral side of the said columns (1).
Method according to Claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 it involves a step of teasing the pile (10) by a
teasing means (12) which rotates in the direction of

formation of the columns (1).
