<ABSTRACT>
A wrap-around package for combining a plurality of articles having a cross-section which reduces from the bottom to the top - in particular bottles (B) - these articles being arranged in two parallel rows, the package consisting of a covering wall (101) which at least partially covers the closures of the articles, two side walls (102a, 103a) and a bottom wall, which walls are defined by an erected blank of card or the like, and the package having two openings on each of its two end faces. According to the invention, there are additionally provided a tab (111) which extends from the covering wall (101) into each edge region of the covering wall, which edge region is located next to an end-face opening and forms an obliquely downwardly directed support between the upper regions of two outer articles of the adjacent rows, and means (112-115) which hold each tab in its position.

Wrap-around pack for collating a number of objects, bottles (B) in particular, 
with a cross-section that diminishes from the bottom towards the top, these 

objects being arranged in two parallel rows, where the pack consists of a top 
panel (101), that covers the top sections of the objects at least to some extent, 

two side panels (102, 103) and a base panel (104), which are defined by an 
erected blank (100) made from board or a similar material, where the pack has 

two openings at each of its two ends and where it also has a flap (111) that 
extends from the top panel (101) into each edge area of the top panel located 

next to one of the end openings and forms a support which extends obliquely 
downwards between the top sections of two of the objects positioned on the 

outside of the adjacent rows as well as elements that keep each flap (111) in 
position, 
wherein
 the flaps (111) forming the supports extend to the outside of 
the wrap-around pack, the elements for holding each flap (111) consisting of a 

strip (112, 113) connected to each flap that is made from the same piece of 
material as the rest of the pack and extends across the relevant opening of the 

wrap-around sleeve a certain distance below the level of the top panel (101) 
and 
wherein
 the two ends of each strip (112, 113) are connected to the 
relevant side panels of the wrap-around sleeve by hinged sections (114, 115)  

 
that are folded on top of each other and against the inside of the relevant side 

panel (102a, 103a) and assume their respective positions when the side panels 
(102a, 103a) of the wrap-around sleeve are folded along the folding lines 

(P12, P13) that separate the said side panels from the top panel (101). 
Pack according to claim 1, 
wherein
 every edge section of the top panel (101) 
has not only an opening but also two extensions (101a), which cover the top 

sections of the objects, and a folding line (P101), which - in relation to these 
extensions - runs in a set-back position between the extensions. 
Pack according to claim 2, 
wherein
 the folding line (P101), which extends 
between the top panel (101) and the flap (111), runs essentially along a 

diameter line of the circular top sections (C) of the two objects located on the 
outside of the pack or in a set-back position in relation to this diameter line. 
Pack according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 the lower edge of each 
strip (112, 113) runs as an extension of at least part of the corresponding edge 

of each side panel (102, 103) in the flat blank. 
Pack according to one of the previous claims, 
wherein
 each flap (111) that 
forms a support is connected to the relevant strip by a folding line (P102).
