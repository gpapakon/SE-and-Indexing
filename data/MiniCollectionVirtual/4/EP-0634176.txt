<CLAIMS>
Insulation of pipelines (5) and fittings (1) on a
steam steriliser, characterised by an insulating plate

(7) which for thermal insulation covers the piping
which is laid substantially in one plane and includes

corner valves (1), inlet and outlet connections form a
90Â° angle to one another, and which has openings (13)

adapted to the contours of the pipelines (5) and the
fittings (1) for the purpose of accommodating the same.
Insulation of pipelines and fittings in a steam
steriliser according to claim 1, characterised in that

the insulating plate for the thermal insulation of the
piping and fittings simultaneously forms the thermal

insulation of the adjoining outer wall of the
sterilising chamber.
