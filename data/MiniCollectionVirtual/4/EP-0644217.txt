<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing polymers of α,ω-unsaturated
conjugated compounds, in particular of compounds which contain
aromatic ring systems. It also relates to high molecular weight polymers
obtainable by said process, to high molecular weight conjugated polymers and
to electroluminescent devices comprising such polymers.
There is an urgent industrial need for large-area solid-state light sources, for a
wide range of applications mostly related to display technologies, and there is
no fully satisfactory technology at present. Polymer-based electroluminescent
devices are very promising and they offer several advantages over conventional,
inorganic light-emitting diodes and liquid-crystal displays. These advantages
include the availability of the whole color spectrum, the ability to make large-area
electroluminescent devices, the ability to make flexible displays, and the
high brightness of the luminescence. This is combined with simple processing
technology and low fabrication costs. Furthermore, displays of this type do not
need backlighting, in contrast to liquid-crystal displays.Polymer-based electroluminescent devices are described, e.g., in WO 90/13 148
and EP-A 0 443 861.
A typical device as described in WO 90/13 148 is made up of a semiconductor
layer in the form of a thin dense polymer film comprising at least one 
conjugated polymer, a first contact layer in contact with a first surface of the
semiconductor layer, and a second contact layer in contact with a second
surface of the semiconductor layer, wherein the polymer film of the
semiconductor layer has a sufficiently low concentration of extrinsic charge
carriers that on applying an electric field between the first and second contact
layers across the semiconductor layer so as to render the second contact layer
positive relative to the first contact layer charge carriers are injected into the
semiconductor layer and radiation is emitted from the semiconductor layer.The polymer employed as a semiconductor layer in these devices is conjugated.By conjugated polymer is meant a polymer which possesses a delocalized
π-electron system along the polymer backbone; the delocalized π-electron
system confers semiconducting properties to the polymer and gives it the ability
to support positive and/or negative charge carriers with high mobilities. Such
polymers are discussed, for example, by R. H. Friend in J. Mol. Elec. 4, (1988)
37.Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) [PPV] is utilized as a charge conducting layer in WO
90/13 148, and
