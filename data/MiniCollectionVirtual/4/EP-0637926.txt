<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communion
dispenser and particularly to a means and method of
providing communion without requiring extensive
on-site preparation of the elements.The ordinance or sacrament of holy communion,
which is celebrated on a frequent basis in most
Christian churches, involves partaking of the bread
followed by the wine or grape juice. These
elements often require extensive preparation and
special serving plates or containers which are
passed to the communicants and then collected. The
elements are usually served consecutively inasmuch
as they are taken in different parts of the service
and it is relatively difficult for the average
participant to balance both elements for an
extended period of time. Historically, a common
cup for the wine was shared by the participants,
this being still the practice in many churches.With small groups or in connection with
communion in remote areas, e.g. in the case of
battlefield services, the necessary preparations
can become difficult and the elements themselves
may not be readily available. Therefore, celebration
of communion can become infrequent. Even with
full facilities, prospective participants may fear
contracting communicable diseases especially in
areas where sanitation may be a problem.Moreover, the preparation and serving of the
elements sequentially to a large group of people
can be quite time-consuming and reduce the time
available for other parts of the service. A more
efficient plan, so far as the individual is 
concerned, would be for all communicants to be served and partake of the
elements substantially simultaneously.In US-A-3514029, there is disclosed a communion container having three
separable parts including a lower lid part adapted to be removably secured over
a cup and an upper lid part sealingly secured on the lower part and defining
therewith a recess for containing communion bread. While such a container
obviates or mitigates some of the problems referred to above, removal of the
upper lid part to gain access to tile bread leaves the user holding two separated
parts while at the same time attempting to remove the bread. The frictional
engagement of the lower lid part on the container is such that potentially the
lower lid part is not that easy to remove from the container in the communion
environment, and spillage of the contents of the container may occur.
US-A-1630867 discloses a bottle cover from a different art. One embodiment
does show the cover as having upper and lower lid parts, partly secured to each
other

A communion dispenser comprising:

an open-top container (10) adapted to receive a liquid (26), and
a two-part lid (14a, 14b) for closing said container comprising a lower
part (14b) and an upper part (14a) outwardly adjacent and adhered to one

another but centrally spaced apart for receiving an edible wafer (20)
therebetween, wherein said upper part is provided with an edge tab (16) for

pulling said upper part away from said lower part, said lid is adhered to the top
of said container around an edge (12) thereof, and the lower part of said lid is

removable to provide access to said liquid, characterised in that said upper and
lower parts are securely joined together at the edge (22) thereof on the opposite

side of said container from said edge tab, and said upper part and said lower
part of said lid comprise folded-over portions of the same piece of material,
and that the upper part (14a) is less securely adhered to said lower part
(14b) than the latter is to the top of said container (10), whereby pulling of said

edge tab (16) can initially remove said upper part (14a) away from said lower
part (14b) other than where said upper and lower parts (14b,14b) are joined

together to provide access to said wafer (20), without removing said lower part
(14b) from the top of said container (10), and thereafter further pulling of said

edge tab (16) can remove said lower part (14b) from the top of said container
(10) to provide access to the latter.
A communion dispenser according to claim 1 wherein said container is
formed of plastic.
A communion dispenser according to claim 1 wherein said lid comprises
heat-sealable material.
A communion dispenser according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the container
is a round tapered cup (10), the edge (12) of which is a substantially flat upper

edge, and the upper and lower parts comprising upper and lower layers (14a,
14b), the lower layer (14b) being removably adhered to the upper edge (12) of

said cup. 
A communion dispenser according to claim 4 wherein said lid is formed
of heat-sealable material, said lower of said two layers (14b) being removably

heat sealed to the upper edge (12) of said cup and the upper layer (14a) of said
two layers being removably heat sealed to said lower layer (14b).
A communion dispenser according to claim 4 or 5 wherein the edge tab
(16) extends radially outwardly from said cup (10) for pulling said upper layer

(14a) away from said lower layer (14b).
A communion dispenser according to any of claims 4 to 6 wherein said
lower layer (14b) is provided with an edge tab (24) extending radially outwardly

from said cup for pulling said lower layer away from said cup.
A communion dispenser according to any of claims 4 to 7 wherein said
upper and lower layers are joined together at the edge (22) to enable upraising

of said lower layer (14b) as joined to said upper layer (14a) by continued
upward movement of said upper layer (14a) substantially after the initial lifting

of said upper layer (14a).
A communion dispenser according to any of claims 4 to 8 wherein each
of said layers is imprinted (28) on the top thereof.
A communion dispenser according to any of claims 4 to 9 wherein said
upper layer (14a) comprises a folded-over extension of said bottom layer (14b)

which is adapted to be unfolded to provide access to said wafer (20).
A method of providing a communion dispenser comprising:

at least partially filling an open-top container (10) with a liquid (26),
removably adhering a first lid layer (14b) to a peripheral top (12) of said
container in a manner for substantially sealing said liquid within said container

but whereby said first lid layer can be peeled away from the top of said
container for providing access to said liquid,
positioning an edible wafer (20) on top of said first lid layer,
removably adhering a second lid layer (14a) peripherally to the first lid
layer (14b) where the first lid layer adjoins the top (12) of said container to provide a

chamber for receiving said wafer (20) whereby said second lid layer (14a) can be
peeled away for access to said wafer (20), and securing a portion of said second 

lid layer (14a) to said first lid layer (14b), characterised in that said second lid
layer (14a) is less securely adhered to said first lid layer (14b) than said first lid

layer is adhered to said container (10), and the first and second lid layers (14b,
14a) are securely joined together at an edge (22) thereof on an opposite side of

the container from an edge tab (16) on the second lid layer (14a), so as to
facilitate peeling away of said second lid layer (14a) from said first lid layer

(14b), without peeling away of said first lid layer from said container, by pulling
of the edge tab (16), and peeling away thereafter of the first lid layer (14b) from

the top of the container by further pulling of the edge tab (16).
