<ABSTRACT>
In order to adjust the hydraulic neutral position of a servovalve in a mounted power steering system consisting of an input shaft 3, an output shaft 4, a torsion rod 7 which is connected by one end to the input shaft 3 and by the other end to the output shaft 4 and a valve sleeve 11 which engages with the output shaft 4 and surrounds the input shaft 3, it is proposed according to the method that the valve sleeve should rotate relative to the output shaft 4 about a common centre axis and be fixed to the output shaft 4 when the hydraulic neutral position is reached. On the device side, an attachment means is proposed which fixes the valve sleeve 11 and the output shaft 4 in relation to one another and can be varied in its position with respect to at least one of the two components.
