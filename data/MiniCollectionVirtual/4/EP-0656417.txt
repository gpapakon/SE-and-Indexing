<ABSTRACT>
Limescale removing compositions are disclosed which comprise a C1-C6 linear or branched 
alkylsulfonic acid or mixtures thereof. Said alkylsulfonic acids are particularly efficient in 

removing limescale and they are furthermore stable to bleach/oxidants. Therefore, 
compositions can be formulated which further comprise acid-stable oxidant compounds. 

Also, mixtures of alkylsulfonic acids and sulfamic acid are particularly effective in removing 
limescale. The compositions of the invention are used to remove limescale from a variety of 

surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions for the removal of limescale. The
compositions herein can be used on a variety of surfaces, ranging from bathrooms and
kitchen surfaces to various appliances. The compositions herein can further be used to
remove limescale from dentures.Tap water always contains a certain amount of solubilized ions which eventually deposit as
salts, on surfaces in contact with said water, as it evaporates. Such salts include calcium
carbonate, commonly referred to as limescale. This phenomenon of limescale accumulation
on surfaces which are often in contact with water may damage surfaces and affect the
functioning of taps or appliances. Also, the accumulation of limescale in the toilet bowls is
aesthetically unpleasant and favors the deposition of further soil and the growth of
microorganisms. It is therefore important to control this limescale accumulation
phenomenon. A variety of compositions have been proposed for this purpose, which typically comprise
various acids, such as hydrochloric acid. However, compositions of the art formulated with
said acids require a significant amount of acid to ensure effective removal of limescale, and
are thus potentially harmful to the user in case of contact with the skin, or accidental
ingestion. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide limescale removing
compositions which are particularly efficient in removing limescale, yet which have a lower
reserve of acidity than the compositions of the art, thus which are less harmful.It is also desirable to formulate compositions which comprise bleaches. Indeed, beaches
possess many desirable properties, including disinfection properties. Furthermore, such
compounds as monopersulfuric acid are particularly effective as disinfectants and in
removing and or decolouring stains for household cleaning applications (European patent
application EP-A-598694). However, beaches in general raise compatibility issues in
relation with the acids used to remove limescale. In particular, persulfuric acid is not
compatible with the acids used in the art to remove limescale because persulfuric acid
oxidizes the limescale removing acid upon storage, resulting in a dramatic loss of available
oxygen. And by the time the product reaches the consumer, most of the available oxygen
is lost. Typical acids used in the art for removing limescale, namely maleic, citric,
hydrochloric and sulfamic acid are all oxidized by persulfuric acid in particular. It is thus an
object of the present invention to provide
