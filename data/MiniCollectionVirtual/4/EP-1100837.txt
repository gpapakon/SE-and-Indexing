<ABSTRACT>
Microcellular polyurethane elastomers having sharply reduced or virtually no urea linkages may be prepared without resort to organic physical blowing agents by frothing a frothable mixture containing isocyanate reactive polyols and chain extenders, and a frothable isocyanate component. The isocyanate component is derived by reacting a stoichiometric excess of a di- or polyisocyanate with a polyol component containing an ultra-low unsaturation polyol. The froth-produced elastomers surprisingly exhibit greatly improved tear strengths, compression set, and other physical properties as compared to all water-blown microcellular elastomers of the same density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to frothed
microcellular polyurethane elastomers. More
particularly, the present invention pertains to
microcellular polyurethane elastomers prepared from low
unsaturation polyoxyalkylene polyethers, and frothed
with permanent gases. These microcellular elastomers
are well suited for use as shoe sole components.Microcellular polyurethane elastomers have
numerous uses, for example as energy absorbing bumpers,
automotive components such as head restraints and
armrests, and in particular as shoe sole components.
Prior to the Montreal protocol, it was possible to
utilize volatile halocarbons such as CFC-11, CFC-22,
methylene chloride, and the like as blowing agents to
provide the numerous very fine cells characteristic of
microcellular elastomers. However, the severe
limitations placed on the use of halogenated
hydrocarbons, and the increasing environmental concerns
relative to the use of even the more environmentally
friendly organic blowing agents has necessitated the
development of water-blown microcellular elastomers. In water-blown polyurethane microcellular elastomers, water present in the
formulation reacts with a portion of the isocyanate component to generate an amine
and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide serves as the blowing agent. However, the
amine generated reacts with further isocyanate to produce urea linkages. The microcellular
elastomer thus produced is not a polyurethane elastomer, but a polyurethane/urea
elastomer containing substantial hard segment urea linkages. Such
elastomers frequently are harder and less resilient than their all polyurethane counterparts.
More importantly, however, the teas strength of such elastomers is limited.
Tear strength is particularly important in applications such as those in the footwear
industry.US-A 5 728 745 discloses microcellular polyurethane suitable for shoe soles obtained
from low unsaturation polyoxyalkylenes by first forming a NCO-terminated
prepolymer followed by simultaneous chain extension with a low molecular weight
polyol and a high molecular weight polyoxyalkylene polyol.GB-A 1 460 863 discloses the use of the gas froth technique and a three-component
reaction system comprising NCO-terminated prepolymer formed by reaction of an
isocyanate with a polyol having an equivalent weight of at most 1000, a chain
extender and a polyether polyol to produce polyurethane elastomers with densities
above 0.2 g/cm3.Polyurethane flexible foams have been air frothed for use in carpet backing and
carpet underlay applications.
