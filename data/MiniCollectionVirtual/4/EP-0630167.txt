<ABSTRACT>
A personal communicator is disclosed which comprises an antenna, 
means for receiving a number assignment module via said antenna, and means for 

storing the number assignment module so as to customize and/or singularize the 
personal communicator. Such a personal communicator can thereby be programmed 

remotely by a cellular service provider without having an authorized agent manually 
program the personal communicator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cellular telephony in general, and more 
particularly, to cellular telephones that incorporate a paging capability that enables 
the telephones to be remotely programmed via a wide-area paging system. Purchases of personal communicators (e.g., cellular telephones) are 
usually inconvenienced by the effort required to program the personal communicator 
before it can be used. In general, a personal communicator can only be programmed 
by an authorized agent of a cellular service provider and usually only at the agent's 
location. Thus, the potential subscriber is often inconvenienced by the delay 
between the purchase and use of the phone, and by the additional costs associated 
with having the agent program the phone. Embodiments of the present invention are capable of programming a 
personal communicator (e.g., a cellular telephone) while avoiding many of the costs 
and restrictions associated with prior techniques. Embodiments of the present 
invention are particularly useful for those who acquire a personal communicator and 
are not near an authorized agent of a cellular service provider. Furthermore, 
embodiments are useful for those who wish to change their service without having to 
incur the inconvenience and cost associated with surrendering possession of the 
personal communicator. These results are obtained in an illustrative embodiment that comprises 
an antenna, means for receiving a number assignment module via said antenna, and 
means for storing said number assignment module. FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention. FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of an illustrative personal communicator 
of the present invention. FIG. 3 shows a flow chart detailing the preferred method of operating 
the illustrative embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 4 shows a continuation of a flow chart detailing the preferred 
method of operating the illustrative embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of an illustrative embodiment of the 
present invention. The illustrative embodiment advantageously comprises cellsites 
101, mobile telephone switching office 103 (hereinafter "MTSO 103"), connection 
105, cellular service provider's customer service bureau 107 (hereinafter "service 
bureau 107"), connection 109, antenna 111, and personal communicator 113. For the 
purposes of the specification, the term "personal communicator" includes, but is not 
limited to, cordless phones, cellular phones, wireless
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for programming a number assignment module into a 
personal communicator, said personal communicator comprising an electro-magnetic 

antenna, said method comprising the steps of: 
   turning-on said personal communicator to receive said number 

assignment module via said electro-magnetic antenna; 
   receiving said number assignment module from an electro-magnetic 

transmitter via said electro-magnetic antenna; and 
   programming said number assignment module into said personal 

communicator. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of: 
   enabling said personal communicator to receive said number assignment 

module via said electro-magnetic antenna; and 
   disabling said personal communicator from receiving additional number 

assignment modules. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of decrypting said 
number assignment module with a security key sequence as a key. 
A personal communicator comprising: 
   an electro-magnetic antenna (209); 

   means for receiving (207) a number assignment module via said 
electro-magnetic antenna; and 

   means for storing (211) said number assignment module into a memory 
(217). 
The personal communicator of claim 4 further comprising: 
   means for transmitting and receiving speech signals via said electro-magnetic 

antenna (209); 
   a first electro-acoustic transducer (213), connected to said transceiver 

(211), for converting a first acoustic speech signal into a first electrical signal; and 
   a second electro-acoustic transducer (215), connected to said transceiver 

(211), for converting a second electrical signal into a second acoustic signal. 
The personal communicator of claim 5 further comprising a keypad 
 

(205), connected to said transceiver (211), for enabling said personal communicator 
to receive said number assignment module. 
The personal communicator of claim 4 wherein said means for 
receiving (207) comprises a pager. 
A method for remotely programming a numeric assignment module 
into a personal communicator, said method comprising the steps of: 

   creating a number assignment module for said personal communicator; 
and 

   transmitting said number assignment module to said personal 
communicator via an electro-magnetic antenna. 
The method of claim 8 further comprising the step of encrypting said 
number assignment module with a security data sequence as a key. 
The method of claim 8 wherein said step of transmitting is 
accomplished via an electro-magnetic paging system.
