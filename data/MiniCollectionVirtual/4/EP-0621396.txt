<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for maintaining the 
mechanical integrity and for maximizing the chemical integrity of 

a core sample during transport from a subterranean formation to the 
surface. The method involves cutting and encapsulating a core 

sample with an encapsulating material that increases in viscosity 
or even solidifies, at temperatures slightly lower than those 

expected downhole, or relatively early in the transport process. 
A preferred encapsulating material contains at least one 
polyglycol or chemically modified polyglycol from the oxyalkylene 

polymer family. The specific formulation of the encapsulating 
material differs depending upon the expected downhole conditions. 

For example, the encapsulating material can include a thickener, a 
nucleating agent, and a water swellable material or another inert 

material that is capable of sealing the core sample against water. 
A preferred nucleating agent would serve both as a heat transfer 

agent and a crystallization trigger, and therefore would speed up 
the rate at which the encapsulating material would solidify or 

increase in viscosity, particularly downhole. The encapsulating 
material should either solidify or increase in viscosity enough to 

protect the mechanical integrity and maximize the chemical 
integrity of the core sample for analysis at the surface. The 

chemical integrity of the core sample can be further maximized by 
using the present invention in conjunction with a pressure core 

barrel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique for maintaining
the mechanical integrity and maximizing the chemical integrity of
a downhole core sample which must be brought to the surface in
order to analyze a subsurface formation.In order to analyze the amount of oil contained in a
particular soil at a particular depth in the proximity of a
subterranean well, a core or core sample of the well material
typically is extracted and brought to the surface for analysis. If
the core sample has retained its mechanical and chemical integrity
during the trip from downhole to the surface, then an analysis of
the core sample will yield accurate data about the percent of fluid
and/or gas contained in the formation. The resulting data then may
be used to determine the type(s) of fluid -- especially oil -- that
is contained in the formation.Unfortunately, it is difficult to maintain the mechanical
and/or chemical integrity of the core sample during its journey
from downhole to the surface. Downhole, the oil and/or water in
the formation may contain dissolved gas which is maintained in
solution by the extreme pressure exerted on the fluids when they
are in the formation. However, unless a pressure core barrel is
used, the pressure on the core when the core is downhole will
differ dramatically from the pressure experienced on the core
sample as the core sample is brought to the surface. As the pressure on the core sample decreases during the trip
to the surface, the fluids in the core tend to expand, and any gas
dissolved in the oil or water contained in the sample will tend to
come out of solution. In addition, any "mobile oil," or oil that
passes through the core in a manner dependent on the permeability,
porosity, and/or volume of fluid contained therein, may drain or
bleed out of the core and be lost. If protective measures are not
taken, then this sellable gas, mobile oil, and/or some water may be
lost during transport of the core to the surface. As a result, the
core sample will not accurately represent the composition of the
downhole formation.One means for dealing with the foregoing problem is pressure
coring, or transporting the core to the surface while maintaining
the downhole pressure on the core. Pressure coring helps to
maintain both the mechanical and chemical integrity of the core.
However, pressure coring is expensive for a number of reasons,
including: the manpower required; the many difficulties that must
be overcome to effectively handle the pressurized core; and, the
expensive procedures required to
