<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid or gel dishwashing 
detergent compositions containing polyhydroxy fatty acid amide, 
calcium ions, and alkylpolyethoxypolycarboxylate surfactant. Liquid or gel dishwashing detergents exhibiting good grease 
removal benefits are much desired by consumers. The addition of 
calcium or magnesium ions to liquid or gel dishwashing detergent 
can under certain conditions improve the grease cleaning benefits 
of the composition. However, it may be necessary to limit the pH 
and/or add chelating agents or lime soap dispersants to stabilize 
the product. WO-A-92/06171 describes unbuilt or gel form detergent compositions 
having effective greasy soil removal performance and skin mildness 
and comprising polyhydroxyfatty acid amide compounds in 
combination with anionic surfactants in specific amounts. EP-A- 129328 discloses a process for obtaining 
alkylpolyethoxypolycarboxylate surfactants, which are suitable 
caustic soluble surfactants having good surface activity and high 
caustic solubility and which may be used in dishwashing 
compositions. HAPPI, Household & Personal Products Industry, Vol.28, no.5, May 
1991, pages 90-94 discloses alkylpolyethoxypolycarboxylate 
surfactant as an alternative component to phosphate and which have 
self-building properties. As concentrated products become increasingly more 
popular, ingredients which can contribute a variety of benefits is 
very important in formulating a product. It has been found that certain alkylpolyethoxypolycarboxylate 
surfactants when added to a liquid or gel dishwashing detergent 
composition containing calcium ions, anionic surfactant, and poly 
hydroxy fatty acid amide and having a pH of from 7 to 
11, prevent insoluble salt precipitation and also act as a 
hydrotrope and a surfactant (if used in sufficient quantities). A light-duty liquid or gel dishwashing detergent composition 
comprising, by weight: 
(a) from 3% to 40% of polyhydroxy fatty acid 
amide having the formula: 
 
wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1-4 hydrocarbyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 
2-hydroxypropyl, or mixtures thereof: R2 is C5-C31 hydrocarbyl;  
  
 
and Z is a polyhydroxy-hydrocarbyl having a linear hydrocarbyl 
chain with at least three hydroxyl groups directly connected to 
the chain, or an alkoxylated derivative thereof; (b) from 3 to 95% of an anionic surfactant;  
and characterised in that it further comprises: 
(c) from 0.1 % to 4% of calcium ions; (d) from 0.001% to 15% of 
alkylpolyethoxypolycarboxylate surfactant having the general 
formula:
