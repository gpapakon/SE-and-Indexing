<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming an electrode assembled 
into a vacuum interrupter is composed of the steps of 

blending silver(Ag) powder and chromium(Cr) powder in a 
content ratio such that Ag powder forms a matrix and Cr 

powder being dispersed therein, the blending ratio is 
prefer to be determined to contain 50 to 95 wt% of Ag 

powder and 5 to 50 wt% of Cr powder, compacting the 

blended powder to a compacted body, sintering the body at 
temperatures around melting point of Ag, and regulating 

density of the sintered article at least 90%. Particle 
size of Cr to be blended may be determined less than 150 

µ m, more preferably, less than 60 µ m. Sintering 
temperature may be determined between 800 to 950 °C .

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
a process for forming
an
electrode material to be assembled into a vacuum
interrupter and to an electrode made of such an electrode material. Specifically, the present invention relates
to such material composed of silver (Ag) and chromium
(Cr) with low contact resistance and excellent breaking
ability.Conventionally, copper(Cu)-bismuth(Bi) alloy is
utilized for an electrode material of a vacuum
interrupter. Such electrode material made of Cu-Bi
generally contains less than 1 wt% of Bi against the
amount of Cu, which is a basis metal, to increase welding
proof of the material. Cu-Bi alloy has low contact
resistance appropriate for electrodes which can provide
large current. However, the material has certain problem
in voltage resistance and breaking ability thereof.Copper(Cu)-chromium(Cr) alloy in which Cr
particles dispersing in a Cu matrix is also utilized for
the material for the aforementioned usage because of
superior voltage resistance and breaking ability thereof
to Cu-Bi alloy. However, contact resistance of the alloy
is relatively higher than that of Cu-Bi alloy,
specifically, contact resistance significantly increases
when current is broken.In addition, electrode materials containing
silver(Ag) is also known in the art, however, breaking
ability thereof is inferior to that of Cu-Cr alloy or Cu-Bi
alloy. Therefore, application of Ag containing
material is limited as Ag-WC alloy for switches which are 
not frequently suffered from current breaking.Recently, according to improvement of the
vacuum interrupter, electrode materials with low contact
resistance having superior voltage resistance and
breaking ability to those of materials made of Cu-Bi
alloy are more and more required for the electrode which
can provide large amount of current.US-A-4 810 289 discloses a process of hot isostatic pressing
of powders to form electrical contacts, comprising the steps
of: mixing powders selected from metals consisting of Ag, Cu,
and mixtures thereof, with powders selected from the class
consisting of CdO, W, WC, Co, Cr, Ni, C, and mixtures
thereof; uniaxially pressing the powders without heating to a
theoretical density of from 60 % to 95 %, to provide a compact;
and hot isostatic pressing the compacts through a pressure
transmitting container, at a pressure between 352 kg/cm2
and 2,115 kg/cm2 and at a temperature from 0.5°C to 100°C below
the melting point or decomposition point of the lower
melting powder, to provide simultaneous hot-pressing and densification
to
