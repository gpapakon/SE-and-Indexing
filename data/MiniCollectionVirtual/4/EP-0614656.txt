<ABSTRACT>
By adding expanded hollow microspheres made of thermoplastic material to aqueous gels, cosmetic compositions, or vehicles for cosmetic compositions, having noteworthy properties of smoothness and gentleness on application are obtained, although these compositions are free from fats. It is thus possible to prepare, for example, make-up foundation compositions, face and body care products, sun gels, eyeshadows or skin cleansing products, including those in the form of face packs.

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic or dermopharmaceutical composition, or 
a vehicle for a cosmetic or dermopharmaceutical composition, 

in the form of a modified gel, characterized in 
that the said composition or said vehicle comprises 

hollow microspheres dispersed in an aqueous gel, in that 
the said hollow microspheres are expanded microspheres 

made of thermoplastic material having a density of 15 to 
200 kg/m
3
, in that the said composition or said vehicle 
contains 0.1 to 10 % by weight of the said microspheres 

relative to the total weight of the composition or 
vehicle, and in that the said composition or said vehicle 

is free from fats. 
Composition or vehicle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the said hollow microspheres have 

average particle sizes which can vary from 5 to 250 µm, 
and especially from 10 to 150 µm. 
Composition or vehicle according to either of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the said gel 

comprises at least one gelling agent in an aqueous liquid 
vehicle, the said gelling agent being chosen from polymers 

which are water-soluble or which give colloidal 
solutions in water. 
Composition or vehicle according to the preceding 
claim, characterized in that the said gelling agent is 

chosen from polymers or copolymers of unsaturated organic 
carboxylic acids or of unsaturated esters, polysaccharide 

derivatives, gums, colloidal silicates, polyethylene 

glycols (PEG) and their derivatives, polyvinylpyrrolidones 
and their derivatives and hydrophilic silica gels. 
Composition or vehicle according to Claim 3 or 4,  
 

characterized in that the said gelling agent is chosen 
from acrylic and/or methacrylic polymers or copolymers, 

vinylcarboxylic polymers, polyglyceryl acrylates or 
methacrylates, cellulose or starch derivatives, chitin 

derivatives, alginates, hyaluronic acid and its salts, 
chondroitin sulphates, xanthan, gellan, Rhamsan, karaya 

or guar gum, carob flour, colloidal aluminium magnesium 
silicates of the montmorillonite type, polyacrylamides 

and their derivatives and polyacrylonitriles. 
Composition or vehicle according to any one of 
Claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the said gelling 

agent is present in a sufficient amount to endow the said 
composition with the viscosity which is desired for the 

said composition or said vehicle. 
Composition or vehicle according to the preceding 
claim, characterized in that the said viscosity can range 

from 3 to 200 poises (equivalent to 0.3 to 20 Pa.s) 
Composition or vehicle according to any one of 
the preceding claims, in the form of a creamy gel, 

characterized in that it contains the said hollow microspheres 
in the proportion of 0.1 to 2 % by weight relative 

to the total weight of the composition, and in that 
the said microspheres are 5-50 µm, and especially 10-30 

µm, in size. 
Cosmetic composition according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it contains 2 to 5 % 

by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition, 
of the said microspheres, the said microspheres 

being 10 to 50 µm in size, the said composition 
constituting a skin cleansing product in the form of a 

face mask. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that it contains 0.5 to 5 % by weight 

of the said microspheres, and in that the said microspheres 
have average sizes of 80 to 250 µm, and 

especially 100 to 250 µm, and in that the said 
composition constitutes an exfoliating product for the 

skin. 
Use of hollow microspheres as are defined in any  
 

one of Claims 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10, as additives intended 
for improving the ease and gentleness of application of 

an aqueous cosmetic or dermopharmaceutical gel free from 
fats. 
Cosmetic treatment process, characterized in that 
a cosmetic composition as defined in any one of Claims 1 

to 10 is applied to the skin.
