The present invention relates to a method for the operation of open data interchange between a plurality of computers connected via a transmission medium, the vocabulary of the structured and/or unstructured data to be interchanged being defined between the transmitting and receiving computers in a modelling stage through the application of one or more table structures. Furthermore, a network system is proposed for the operation of open data interchange between a plurality of networked computers, a memory being provided for the vocabulary agreed between the transmitting and receiving computers, in particular on a hard disk of a communications processor.
