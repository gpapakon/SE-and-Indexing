<ABSTRACT>
A solar energy collector consists of a plurality of collector elements (5, 6, 7, 8) which can be secured on a preferably inclined supporting surface (2), for example a roof, and which have each a base body (9) with one or several collector channels lying in a plane (12) that faces the sun and connectable to a heat transfer fluid network, as well as possibly one or several absorber channels lying in a plane (13) transversely oriented to the collector channel. At least in the area of two parallel sides among its four sides, the base body (9) of the collector element is provided with a coupling stud (15) that extends transversely to the plane (14) of the base body, and at its opposite side, the base body (9) is provided with a coupling groove (17) whose dimensions are adapted to those of the coupling stud (15) and which receives the coupling stud (15) of the directly adjacent base body (9). Studs and grooves help to solidly anchor the base bodies to each other and at the same time to seal them with respect to the supporting surface. In order to be able to arrange the collector element both on north-south oriented roofs and on east-west oriented roofs without having to fear for leaks, at least on the side of the base body provided with the first coupling stud (15) that extends transversely to the plane (14) of the base body is arranged a second coupling stud (16) which extends in the same direction. A second coupling groove (18) associated to this second coupling stud and whose dimensions are adapted to those of the second coupling stud (16) is arranged at the opposite side of the base body (9).

A solar collector installation comprising a plurality of collector elements (5, 6, 7, 8) 
which can be fixed to a supporting surface (2), preferably a sloping supporting surface e.g. 

a roof, each of which comprises a base body (9) having one or more collector ducts which 
lie in a plane (12) facing the sun and which can be connected to a heat transfer fluid 

network, and optionally comprises one or more absorber ducts aligned in a plane (13) 
transverse to the collector duct plane, wherein the base bodies (9) of the collector elements 

(5, 6, 7, 8) are provided, at least in the region of two sides, which extend parallel to each 
other, of their four sides, with a coupling tongue (15) in each case for mutual, fixed 

anchorage and for sealing at the same time, which coupling tongue extends transverse to a 
base body plane (14) passing through the lower edges of the base body (9), and a coupling 

groove (17), the dimensions of which are matched to those of the coupling tongue (15), is 
formed on the opposite side of the base body (9) for receiving the coupling tongue of the 

directly adjacent base body (9), characterised in that a second coupling tongue (16) extending 
in the same direction is provided at least on the side of the base body having the first 

coupling tongue (15) which extends transverse to the plane (14) of the base body, and that 
on the opposite side of the base body (9) a second coupling groove (18), the dimensions of 

which are matched to those of the second coupling tongue (16), is associated with this second 
coupling tongue. 
A solar collector installation according to claim 1, characterised in that both the first 
and the second coupling tongues (15, 16) are fixed extending downwards on one side of the 

base body (9), and that the first and also the second coupling groove (17, 18) are constructed 
opening upwards on the opposite side of the base body (9). 
A solar collector installation according to claim I or 2, characterised in that the first 
and the second coupling tongues (15, 16) are disposed offset in height in relation to each 

other, as are the associated first and second coupling grooves (17, 18).  
 
A solar collector installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that at least one of the two coupling tongues (15) is provided with a recess (19) in the region 

of its end face tongue edge, which recess is delimited on both sides by a narrow tongue edge 

border. 
A solar collector installation according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the double coupling tongues and grooves, respectively, are only provided on the two 

longitudinal sides of the base body which run parallel to the line of intersection of the planes 
(12, 13) of successive collector and absorber ducts, and that a stepped wall portion (22), 

which extends transversely between a lower side region (20) of the base body (9) to an upper 
side region, is provided on each of the two transverse sides of the base body running 

transverse to the said longitudinal sides, which stepped wall portion, together with the 
stepped wall portion (22') of the adjacent collector element, delimits a joint (23) with a width 

corresponding to twice the step height, and that a sealing strip (25) consisting of elastic 
material, preferably silicone rubber, which covers the gap (24) between the lower side 

regions (20, 20') of the adjacent base bodies and which extends over the width of the joint, 
is inserted in the joint. 
A solar collector installation according to claim 5, characterised in that the sealing 
strip has a length which corresponds to the length of the overall joint formed by the 

successive individual joints (23). 
A solar collector installation according to claims 5 or 6, characterised in that the 
sealing strip (25) runs out into an edge section (26, 26') of larger cross-section in the region 

of each of its longitudinal edges, which cross-section is matched to the cross-section of a

section.

each base body (9), which indentation, together with the corresponding indentation (28') in

elements to the supporting surface, and that the width of the central strip region joining the 

two edge sections (26, 26') of the sealing strip (25) is dimensioned so that when the sealing
