<ABSTRACT>
A construction for retaining an electrically conductive 
coiled spring (13) which is inserted into a hollow (11a) 

of a high-voltage terminal (11) subjected to a high voltage 
in an engine ignition system (K) so as to electrically connect 

a head terminal (12a) of a spark plug (12) or an ignition coil 
and the high-voltage terminal (11), the construction 

comprising: a first stopper (11d) which is formed on a side 
wall (11b) of the hollow (11a) of the high-voltage terminal 

(11) so as to project into the hollow (11a) and is brought 
into contact with an insertion end (13a) of the coiled spring 

(13) so as to retain the insertion end (13a) of the coiled 
spring (13); and a second stopper (14) which is radially 

fitted around an outer surface of the side wall (11b) of the 
high-voltage terminal (11) and is formed with a tongue piece 

(14b) and a projection (14a); wherein the tongue piece (14b) 
is inserted between neighboring coil windings of the coiled 

spring (13) in the hollow (11a) from a slit (11f) of the high-voltage 
terminal (11), while the projection (14a) is brought 

into engagement with a hole (11e) of the high-voltage terminal 
(11) so as to be inserted between further neighboring coil 

windings of the coiled spring (13) in the hollow (11a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a high-voltage 
terminal in an engine ignition system, which is 
directly connected with a spark plug or an ignition coil of 
an engine and more particularly, to a construction for 
retaining a coiled spring inserted into the high-voltage 
terminal. Fig. 1 shows a known ignition system disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-47475 (1991). In 
Fig. 1, a high-voltage terminal 2 is embedded in a high-voltage 
tower 1 and an electrically conductive coiled spring 
5 for electrically connecting the high-voltage terminal 2 and 
a head terminal 4 of a spark plug 3 is inserted into a hollow 
of the high-voltage terminal 2. An insertion end 5a of the 
coiled spring 5 should be fixed to the high-voltage terminal 
2 so as to prevent gravity-drop of the coiled spring 5. To 
this end, an annular groove 2a is formed on a side wall of the 
hollow of the high-voltage terminal 2 and an outside diameter 
d1 of the insertion end 5a of the coiled spring 5 is so set 
as to be larger than an outside diameter d2 of the coiled 
spring 5, i.e. d1>d2 as shown in detail in Fig. 2. Thus, 
while the insertion end 5a is being radially compressed by 
rotating the coiled spring 5 in its winding direction, the 
coiled spring 5 is inserted into the hollow of the high-voltage 
terminal 2 such that the insertion end 5a is brought  
 
into engagement with the groove 2a. However, the known engine ignition system has such 
a drawback that since it is difficult to insert the large-diameter 
insertion end 5a of the coiled spring 5 into the 
hollow of the high-voltage terminal 2, efficiency for 
inserting the coiled spring 5 into the hollow of the high-voltage 
terminal 2 is poor. Furthermore, the known engine 
ignition system is disadvantageous in that since force of 
engagement of the coiled spring 5 with the groove 2a, namely, 
force for fixing the coiled spring 5 to the groove 2a of the 
high-voltage terminal 2 is small, the coiled spring 5 is 
readily disengaged from the groove 2a when pulled outwardly. The document FR-A-651 497 discloses a construction which has the features 
indicated in the pre-characterizing part of claim 1.  
 It is an essential object of the present 
invention to provide a construction for retaining a coiled 
spring of a high-voltage terminal in an engine ignition 
system, in which the coiled spring can be easily inserted into 
a hollow of the high-voltage terminal so as to be brought into 
engagement with the high-voltage terminal and the coiled 
spring can
