<ABSTRACT>
The speed of a vehicle including a 
transmission operable under driver control and speed 

control apparatus is controlled by detecting the 
disengagement of the transmission clutch during a 

driver actuated gear change, disabling speed control 
on disengagement of the clutch, detecting 

re-engagement of the clutch, and re-enabling speed 
control. The system (10) determines whether speed 

control prior to disengagement of the clutch was in a 
normal mode or a resume mode and returns to the mode 

active prior to disengagement (102). If the normal mode was 
active, the vehicle is first accelerated to the set 

speed at a rate determined as a function of the 
difference between the vehicle and set speeds (104). If the 

resume mode was active, the vehicle is accelerated to 
the set speed on the basis of the difference between 

the vehicle and set speeds and as a function of the 
vehicle speed (106).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
controlling the speed of a vehicle and to vehicle
speed control apparatus.Systems for controlling vehicle speed, generally
known as cruise control systems, are widespread. With
most known cruise control systems, cruise control is
disabled on the occurrence of certain events, such as on
depression of the brake or clutch pedal or on actuation of
a disabling switch. It is known to provide a resume
function, enabled by a suitable switch, by which the speed
of the vehicle can be controlled at the previously set
speed following disablement. JP-A-63-188531 discloses a
method and apparatus in accordance with the preambles of
claims 1 and 5 respectively.The present invention seeks to provide an
improved method of controlling vehicle speed and
improved speed control apparatus.A method of and apparatus for controlling
the speed of a vehicle in accordance with the present
invention is characterised over JP-A-63-188531 by the
features specified in the characterising portions of
claims 1 and 5 respectively.The inventors have recognised that for a
vehicle with a manual transmission, a driver will often
change gear to provide a more acceptable engine speed
for the current conditions but without wanting to drop
out of cruise control. For example, the driver may want
to choose a high gear when travelling on a substantially
flat road at a fairly constant speed to reduce engine
noise. Similarly, when travelling up a hill, the driver
may wish to change to a lower gear to prevent the engine
labouring. In both of these situations, the driver may
wish to maintain cruise control, which with conventional
cruise control systems is only possible by manual
actuation of the resume switch. The transmission may be a conventional
manual transmission or any other transmission which
requires a driver actuated gear change command.The method comprises the step of
determining whether speed control prior to
disengagement of the clutch is in a normal cruise control mode or a
resume mode, the step of re-enabling speed control
including the step of returning to the mode active
prior to disengagement. This feature can allow, for
example, the engine speed to be controlled by
appropriate gear selection when accelerating from a
low speed up to a higher set speed without dropping
out of cruise control.Advantageously, when it is determined that
speed control was in a normal mode prior to
disengagement of the clutch, the method may include
the step of accelerating the vehicle to a set speed as
a function of

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling the speed of a
vehicle including a transmission operable under driver

control and speed control apparatus, comprising the
steps of detecting (10,24,C) the disengagement of a transmission

clutch during a driver actuated gear change, disabling (10,30)
speed control on disengagement of the clutch,

detecting (10,24,C) re-engagement of the clutch, and re-enabling (10,30)
speed control on re-engagement of the clutch;

characterised by the step (102) of determining whether speed
control prior to disengagement of the clutch is in a normal

cruise control mode or a resume mode, the step of re-enabling
speed control (10,30) including the step (104-108) of returning to the

mode active prior to disengagement.
A method according to claim 1,
comprising, when it is determined that speed control

was in the normal cruise control mode prior to disengagement of the
clutch, the step (104) of accelerating the vehicle to

a set speed as a function of the difference between
the vehicle speed and the set speed.
A method according to claim 2, wherein
the step (104) of accelerating the vehicle to the set speed

includes the step of determining the acceleration from
a look-up table (16) on the basis of the difference between

the vehicle speed and the set speed.
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
comprising, when it is determined that speed control

was in the resume mode prior to disengagement of the

clutch, the step (106) of accelerating the vehicle to
a set speed as a function of the difference between

the vehicle speed and the set speed and as a function
of a measure of the vehicle speed.
Speed control apparatus for controlling
the speed of a vehicle including a transmission 

operable under driver control, the speed control

the clutch.
