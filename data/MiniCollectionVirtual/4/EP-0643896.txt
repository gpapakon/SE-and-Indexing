Copying device with a scanner camera (1) for scanning 
originals which can be illuminated for the copying process, 


having an adjustable optical system (5) for optical 
projection of the original from an object plane (14) into 

a predetermined image plane (4) of the camera, 
having a photoelectric line sensor (2), by means of which 
an image point scanning of a predetermined projection area 

in this image plane (4) of the camera can be performed, and 
at the output of which the electric signals of the 

individual scanning points are available, 
 
characterised in that, 


for a print out of a copy of the original, which occurs 
simultaneously with the signals that become available at 

the output (102) of the line sensor (2) during the copying 
process, this output (102) of the line sensor (2) is 

connected directly to the signal input (76) of the print 
mechanism (100) of a printer (101) which is provided, in 

the case of black-and-white copying by way of a level 
discriminator (72) or in the case of copying with 

intermediate value levels of the output signal by way of an 
analog/digital converter (72), and by way of an image data 

buffer memory (73), 
and in that, 
the line sensor (2) is moveable by means of a hydraulic 
drive system which has a master cylinder/piston unit (34, 

35) driven by a positioning/stepping motor (62) and a slave 
piston/cylinder unit (30, 31) mechanically connected to the 

line sensor (2). 
Copying device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
a signal amplifier (71) is additionally provided in this 

direct connection of line sensor output (102) and input 
(76) of the print mechanism (100).  

 
Copying device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that,
 
for the process of simultaneous print out of the copy there 

is provided relative to the scanning process a 
predetermined range for a temporal displacement of the two 

processes. 
Copying device according to any of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that,
 
the slave piston/cylinder unit (30, 31) has two parallel 

running pistons (31) which are in pushing/pulling 
connection with the line sensor (2) to be displaced. 
Copying device according to any of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that,
 
this drive system comprises, as master unit, a driven 

arrangement (134', 36) which controllably transports a 
hydraulic medium (301) on two sides, a first (33) and a 

second (33') hydraulic connection line and a slave 
piston/cylinder unit (30', 31) which works on two sides. 
Copying device according to claim 5,
 
with a master cylinder/piston unit (34', 35) which works 

double sidedly.
