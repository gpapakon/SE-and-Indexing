<ABSTRACT>
The present application discloses an invention which addresses and resolves long standing lid size reduction problems in the beverage-canning industry and comprises diametrally reduced adapter nozzles (60), and related methods, used as replacements only for the nonaccommodating distal discharge nozzle structure of a commercially existing fill valve (10), which is preferably removed by conventional machining techniques. Each adapter nozzle (60) is fastened to the nonremoved portion or remainder (10) of the fill valve (10) in sealed relation and comprises a plurality of angularly disposed beverage flow passageways (100) which selectively converts beverage flow from several streams issuing from the remainder (10) of the existing fill valve (10) into three broad, although thin streams and discharges the three beverage streams angularly against the top region of the interior surface of the side wall of the can having reduced size lid opening so that foaming, if any, is within tolerable limits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
machinery by which a predetermined quantity of beverage
is placed in a can after which the can is capped and more
particularly to novel beverage adapter nozzles, and
related methods, which replaces an existing flared distal
nozzle portion of a standard beverage fill valve whereby
filling of a can having a smaller diametral opening in
the top thereof is accommodated.Typical of automated machinery by which a
beverage, such as soda pop and beer, is dispensed into
open top, later capped cans are the disclosures of U.S.
Patents 4,387,748 and 4,750,533.Such automated machinery comprises fill valves
by which pressurized gas and beverage are delivered into
each can through the open top thereof. Such fill valves
comprise standard distal beverage effluent nozzle
structure comprising an array of downwardly and outwardly
directed beverage discharge passages. This standard
effluent nozzle structure is diametrally sized to fit
through the opening in the top of a can of predetermined
size on a close tolerance basis so that the circular
discharge streams of beverage not only angularly strike
against the most elevated part of the inside surface of
the side wall of the can but also the flow distance
between the end of each nozzle passageway and the side
wall of the can is minimized whereby beverage foaming is
kept within tolerable limits.Particularly in respect to cans made of
aluminum, the beverage industry has continually sought
ways to reduce the amount of aluminum used to fabricate
each can. Side walls have been materially reduced in
thickness. Also, from time to time the beverage industry
has reduced the size of the lid placed upon an aluminum
can to further reduce the amount of aluminum used. Reduction in lid size correspondingly reduces the pre-lid top opening in the
can.The latest change being implemented by the beverage industry is a
reduction in aluminium lid size to a size #204, for the first time. Further lid
size reductions can be anticipated. With such reductions in aluminium lid sizes
and corresponding reduction in the size of openings at the top of aluminium
cans comes obsolescence of certain parts of the beverage-filling machinery.
Specifically, a size #204 can will not accept the distal discharge nozzle
structure of existing fill valves due to dimension interference. Thus, the
progressive movement by the beverage industry to smaller and smaller lids and,
therefore, smaller and smaller openings at the top of aluminium cans leaves
existing fill valves
