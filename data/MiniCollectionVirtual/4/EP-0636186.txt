<ABSTRACT>
Method and composition for distinguishing different-sequence polynucleotides electrophoretically in a non-sieving medium. In practicing the method, there are formed one or more different-sequence polynucleotide(s) which contain (i) a detectable reporter label and (ii) an attached polymer chain which imparts to each different-sequence polynucleotide, a distinctive ratio of charge/translational frictional drag. The different-sequence polynucleotides which are formed are fractionated by capillary electrophoresis in a non-sieving matrix and detected according to their observed electrophoretic migration rates. The method can be used for DNA sequencing and for detecting one or more selected sequences in a sample.

available for detecting the presence of one or more
selected polynucleotide sequences in a sample
containing a large number of sequence regions. In a
simple method, which relies on fragment capture and
labeling, a fragment containing a selected sequence
is captured by hybridization to an immobilized probe.
The captured fragment can be labeled by hybridization
to a second probe which contains a detectable
reporter moiety.Another widely used method is Southern blotting.
In this method, a mixture of DNA fragments in a
sample are fractionated by gel electrophoresis, then
fixed on a nitrocellulose filter. By reacting the
filter with one or more labeled probes under 
hybridization conditions, the presence of bands
containing the probe sequence can be identified. The
method is especially useful for identifying fragments
in a restriction-enzyme DNA digest which contain a
given probe
