<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an IC card-based test apparatus and method, and more particularly but not exclusively to the use of an IC card or the like for testing channel decoder apparatus.In the field of satellite and cable broadcasting it is well-known to provide pay channels that are only made available to viewers who have paid a subscription. The channel itself is transmitted in scrambled form. The viewer is provided with decoding equipment as part of the receiver apparatus that he is provided with upon signing up. Upon payment of the subscription the viewer is provided with a smart card that contains key information enabling the channel to be descrambled for the period of time covered by the subscription. Such an arrangement is known as a conditional access system.In order to implement such a conditional access system it is necessary to provide a defined interface between the smart card and the decoding equipment. The interface requires the decoding apparatus to operate within certain limits as defined by a specification. There are numerous interface standards in use, for example ISO, NDC (NDS), EMV and GSM. The decoding apparatus itself may be made by manufacturers not in any way associated with the makers of the smart cards. The decoding apparatus is usually made with interface parameters that lie within tolerances defined by the specification but sometimes some of the parameters are slightly out. Generally only a small number of features are marginally outside the specified tolerance with the result that the apparatus will work with most smart cards but not with all. This makes the apparatus very hard to test for all circumstances and very annoying for customers who find that their apparatus works well for several months and then fails following acquisition of a new smartcard.In general smartcards that are used in security applications are fast turnaround products due to the frequent need to replace some part of the security system, change a key or the like. The cards are thin and thus the chips inside are relatively hard to protect from damage. Therefore a great deal of research has gone in to smart card design. Smart card technology improves rapidly yet it is important that new, updated, smartcards remain compatible with old decoder boxes. In practice different generations of smartcard, as well as different batches of cards of the same generation, have different levels of tolerance to decoder box aberrations from specified ranges of signal parameters.DE-A-19542262 discloses a test device
