<ABSTRACT>
Described is the use of a polymer containing, as the orientation layer in liquid-crystal displays, maleic imide units of the general formula (I), in which R
<
1
>
 is hydrogen or an acyclic or cyclic aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic group which may be chiral or achiral, which may be substituted by one or more functional groups and in which one or more CH2 groups may be replaced by functional groups. Orientation films containing a polymer of the general formula (I) enable twist conditions and ghost images to be suppressed, thus improving optical contrast.

Use of a polymer containing maleimide units of the 
formula I 


 
in which 


R
1
is hydrogen, an acyclic or cyclic, aliphatic, 
aromatic or araliphatic radical which is chiral 

or achiral, may be monosubstituted or polysubstituted 
by functional groups and in which 

one or more CH

 groups may be replaced by 
functional groups, as alignment layer in 

liquid-crystal displays. 
Use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polymer is 
employed as alignment layer in ferroelectric liquid-crystal 

displays. 
Use as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein R

an aromatic, aliphatic or araliphatic ring 

having 6 to 24 carbon atoms or a branched or unbranched 
aliphatic radical having 1 to 40 carbon  

 
atoms, which may also contain chiral centers, in 

which one or more hydrogen atoms, independently of 
one another, may be replaced by -OH, -F, -Cl, -Br,
