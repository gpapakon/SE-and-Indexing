<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to antennas for
receiving RF signals and more particularly to the tuning of
a resonant cavity formed on a printed circuit board.Some antennas formed on a circuit boards have a
resonant cavity defined by a ground plane on one side of the
circuit board, a formed piece of strip line referred to as a
stub on the other side of the circuit board and an
electrical connection between them. The shape and length of
the stub determines the resonant frequency of the cavity.
Generally, the stub is formed of strip line shaped on a
circuit board. In order to tune these antennas, discrete
components such as capacitors and inductors are used. For
example, variable capacitors and variable inductors are used
to tune the desired resonant frequency during the
manufacturing process to compensate for manufacturing
variability or substitutions of materials. However,
variations in temperature such as that encountered by an
automobile causes the characteristics of the discrete
components to change, which in turn causes the resonant
frequency of the antenna to drift.It is desirable to retain some manufacturing
flexibility in an antenna design. For instance, if certain
materials of the circuit board are unavailable during the
life cycle of the circuit board substitute materials may be
used. This may cause the resonant frequency to shift.
Consequently, it is desirable to compensate for any
frequency shift to facilitate retaining component material
flexibility. US Patent 4 367 474 describes an antenna comprising a
dielectric substrate having a square conductive patch
forming an energy radiator with an active radiating region
defined by the sides of the square. A conductive layer forms
a ground plane on an opposed surface of the substrate. A
radio frequency input is applied to the conductive patch at
a selectable frequency. Means are provided for changing the
frequency characteristics of the active radiating region.
These means include either conductive posts or switchable
diodes arranged along a bisector or an edge of the square
patch.US Patent 4 625 185 describes a resonant strip line
circuit comprising a dielectric substrate having an
electrically conducting strip on a first surface. The strip
is of a generally G shape. A metal film layer is applied to
the other surface of the substrate. The dielectric substrate
is made of quartz and the resonant circuit presents a high
Q-factor and high selectivity characteristics. No selectable
tuning of the resonant circuit is described.The present invention
