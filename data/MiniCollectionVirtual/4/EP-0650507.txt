<ABSTRACT>
An intumescent composition comprises saline soluble inorganic silicate fibrous material containing CaO, MgO and no more than 4 % by weight of Al2O3, such as calcium magnesium silicate. The fibres may be vitreous, with an average length of 10 to 500 microns, and may form 5 to 30 weight percent of the composition. The composition may be incorporated in a coating composition, e.g. for wet coating (paint) or powder coating, or a mastic or putty, or a composition containing a polymer. Enhanced fire protection can be provided, and the coating compositions may be applied as a single thick coating rather than by building up thin layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intumescent compositions, and to 
coating compositions which incorporate such intumescent 
compositions and which can be applied to various substrates 
so as to form thereon an intumescent coating. It relates 
in particular to such intumescent and coating compositions 
which include inorganic fibres. Intumescent coatings for providing thermal protection, 
flame retardation and/or smoke suppression are well known 
in the art. A typical coating composition for providing 
such a coating will include an intumescent composition and 
a film forming resin system. Although the different components of the compositions will 
be referred to by function as though they were different 
materials, it should be understood that a single material 
may in some cases have more than one of the specified 
functions, either to a minor degree, so that it supplements 
the action of a component already provided, or to a major 
degree, so that it can replace or partially replace a 
component which would otherwise be required. Thus for 
example a film forming component of the resin system may 
itself contribute significantly to the formation of char. 
Furthermore the components may have other desirable 
properties, such as flame retardation, in addition to those 
primary functions specified. Typically, the intumescent composition will comprise a 
catalyst (foaming agent), a carbonific or char forming 
agent, and a blowing agent. These are not necessarily 
different materials, as indicated above. Both the nature 
and the relative amounts (ranges) of these components are 
well known in the art.  
 The resin system will typically comprise a film forming 
binder. It may include a solvent, which may be either an 
organic solvent or water, but solvent free systems, e.g. 
for powder coating, are also possible. The intumescent composition may optionally include other 
components such as pigments. In an intumescent coating 
composition, pigments may be considered to be part of the 
intumescent composition, or as components additional 
thereto. Typical catalysts and/or foaming agents are monoammonium 
phosphate, diammonium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate, 
potassium tripolyphosphate, or combinations thereof. 
Typical charring agents are pentaerythritol, 
dipentaerythritol, polyols, chlorinated paraffins, and 
combinations thereof. Typical blowing agents include 
melamine resins, urea, dicyandiamide and combinations 
thereof. An intumescent composition will typically 
comprise 10 to 55 parts by weight of catalyst,
