<ABSTRACT>
This invention contemplates improved methods of enzymatic production of carbohydrates especially fucosylated carbohydrates. Improved syntheses of glycosyl 1- or 2-phosphates using both chemical and enzymatic means are also contemplated. The phosphorylated glycosides are then used to produce sugar nucleotides that are in turn used as donor sugars for glycosylation of acceptor carbohydrates. Especially preferred herein in the use of a disclosed method for fucosylation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides for improved methods
of enzymatic production of fucosylated carbohydrates.
Also disclosed are sugar nucleotides
which are used as donor sugars for fucosylation
of acceptor carbohydrates.This invention provides for a method of
producing a fucosylated carbohydrate in a single
reaction mixture comprising the steps of: using a
fucosyltransferase to form an O-glycosidic bond between
a nucleoside 5'-diphospho-fucose and an available
hydroxyl group of a carbohydrate acceptor molecule to
yield a fucosylated carbohydrate and a nucleoside
5'-diphosphate; and recycling in situ the nucleoside 
5'-diphosphate with fucose to form the corresponding
nucleoside 5'-diphospho-fucose. Preferred methods of
this invention include the use of guanine as a base for
the nucleoside, the use of catalytic amounts of
nucleosides, the use of N-acetylglucosamine, galactose,
N-acetylgalactosamine or N-acetyllactosamine as the
carbohydrate acceptor molecule, and the use of a
sialylated carbohydrate acceptor molecule.This invention further contemplates the above
method for producing fucosylated sialylated carbohydrate
molecule through enzymatic formation of glycosidic
linkages in a single reaction mixture comprising:
forming a first glycosidic linkage between an
diphosphonucleoside-activated glycosyl donor such as
UDP-Gal and an available hydroxyl group of a
carbohydrate acceptor molecule such as GlcNAc using a
first glycosyltransferase such as
β1,4-galactosyltransferase in preparing Galβ1,4GlcNAc;
forming a second glycosidic linkage between a
monophosphonucleoside-activated sialyl donor such as
CMP-NeuAc and an available hydroxyl group of the sugar
acceptor molecule such as the 3-position hydroxyl of the
Gal of Galβ1,4GlcNAc using a sialyltransferase such as
α2,3sialyltransferase; forming a third glycosidic
linkage between a diphosphonucleoside-activated fucosyl
donor such as GDP-Fuc and an available hydroxyl group of
the sugar acceptor molecule such as the 3-position
hydroxyl of the GlcNAc of Galβ1,4GlcNAc using a
fucosyltransferase such as al,3/4fucosyltransferase
wherein at least one of steps (a) (b) or (c) further
comprise the in situ formation of the phosphonucleotide-
activated glycosyl donor from a catalytic amount of the
corresponding monophosphate and diphosphate nucleoside.
Especially preferred are methods of this invention
wherein the fucosylated sialylated carbohydrate moiety 
product is a sialylated Lewis ligand such as sialyl Lex
(SLex) or sialyl Lea (SLea) and wherein the fucose is
transferred from
