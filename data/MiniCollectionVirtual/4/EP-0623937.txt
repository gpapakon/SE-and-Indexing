<ABSTRACT>
Provided is an insulated oxide superconducting cable 
conductor having a high critical current and a high 

critical current density. The insulated oxide 
superconducting cable conductor comprises an elongated 

former (11), a plurality of tape-shaped multifilamentary 
oxide superconducting wires (12) which are wound on the 

former (11) at a bending strain factor of not more than 
0.5 %, and a spirally wound tape-shaped insulating 

material (13) covering the tape-shaped multifilamentary 
oxide superconducting wires-(12). The tape-shaped 

multifilamentary superconducting wires (12) are superposed 
on the former in layers, whereby stabilizing materials of 

the superposed superconducting wires (12) are in contact 
with each other. The tape-shaped insulating material (13) 

consists essentially of a material which is contracted at 
a thermal contraction ra
te of at least three times that of 
the tape-shaped multifilamentary wires (12) by cooling 

from a temperature of 298 K to that of 77 K. The tape-shaped 
insulating material (13) can apply a pressure to 

the superposed multifilamentary superconducting wires (12) 
toward the former (11) while improving electrical contact 

between the superposed multifilamentary superconducting 
wires (12) by cooling in employment. The former (11) can 

be formed of a flexible tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an high Tc (Critical
Temperature) superconducting cable conductor employing an
oxide superconductor, and more particularly, it relates to
an insulated superconducting cable conductor having
flexibility, which is applicable to a superconducting
cable.In relation to an oxide superconductor which enters a
superconducting state at the liquid nitrogen temperature,
expected is application to a superconducting cable with a
cooling medium of liquid nitrogen. When such application
is implemented, it may be possible to simultaneously
attain simplification of a thermal protection system and
reduction of a cooling cost, which are necessary for a
metal superconducting cable requiring high-priced liquid
helium.A number of superconducting cables have been prepared
from metal superconductors, followed by increasing study
of insulating materials therefor. In relation to such
insulating materials, the dielectric breakdown 
characteristic, the dielectric characteristic and the
insulating life are taken into consideration on the
premise that the same are not cracked under cooling
temperatures. In relation to a metal superconducting
cable, however, it has not been particularly necessary to
consider influence exerted on the critical current by an
insulating material as employed, since a metal
superconductor has relatively high mechanical strength and
exhibits an extremely high critical current density at the
liquid helium temperature in a state with no application
of a magnetic field.In an oxide superconducting wire such as a bismuth
based oxide superconducting wire which is stabilized by
silver, the critical current density at the liquid
nitrogen temperature is about 1/10 that at the liquid
helium temperature at present. In the oxide
superconducting wire, therefore, influence exerted on the
critical current by the insulating material is more
significant as compared with that in the metal
superconductor. Further, an oxide superconducting wire
containing ceramics is inferior in resistance against
mechanical strain as compared with the metal
superconducting wire. When an oxide superconducting wire
is subjected to remarkable bending in preparation of a
cable, for example, its critical current may be extremely 
reduced.US-A-4 031 310 (JACHIMOWICZ LUDWIK) 21, June 1977
discloses a shrinkable electrical cable core for cryogenic
cables, wherein a cable core made of two layers of
helically wound strips of metal with one layer having a
right hand lay and the other layer having a left hand lay.
