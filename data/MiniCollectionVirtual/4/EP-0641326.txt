<DESCRIPTION>
 SUBSTITϋTED 1,2,3,4-TETRAHYDROISOQUINOLINES WITH ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST PROPERTIESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONU.S. 4,812,462 describes 4,5, 6,7-tetrahydro-lH- imidazo[4,5- ]pyridine derivatives as antagonists of angiotensin II (All) binding at a particular subtype of its cellular receptors, namely the AT receptor. By virtue of their AT2 receptor antagonist property, these compounds are disclosed to have utility in the treatment of vascular restenosis, atherosclerosis and disorders related to excessive vasopressin (AVP) secretion, various disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) , and also have utility in the regulation of female reproductive functions.Atherosclerotic arterial occlusive disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (W. P. Castelli, Am. J. Med. 76:4-12 (1984)). One important strategy in the treatment of this disorder is the use of various revascularization techniques such as saphenous vein bypass grafting, endarterectomy, and transluminal coronary angioplasty. Unfortunately, the overall success of these revascularization procedures is limited by restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia. The magnitude of this problem in clinical medicine is increasing with the rising rate of cardiovascular surgery and interventional therapy.Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of restenosis, including the hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) , which is an integral part of the renin-angiotensin system and is a regulator of 

vascular tone and structure. Ang II is a potent vasoconstrictor which plays a central role in hypertension, congestive heart failure, and vascular diseases. In vivo, Ang II is implicated in the vascular hypertrophy of hypertension since angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can prevent or attenuate medial hypertrophy in many models of hypertension (G. K. Owens, Hypertension 9:178-187 (1987)). Recently it has been found that inhibitors of ACE and angiotensin II antagonists (ATχ subtype) will reduce or attenuate the development of intimal hyperplasia in the rat in response to injury (J. S. Powell, et al. Science 245:186-188 (1989); A. W. Clowes, et al, Hvpertension 18[Suppl II]) : II65-II69 (1991) , W. Osterrieder, et al. Hypertension lδtSuppl II]: II60-II64 (1991)) . These growth inhibitory effects are independent of the hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors since treatment with other blood pressure lowering drugs does not inhibit this growth (J. S. Powell, et al, J. Card. Pharmacol.16(Suppl. 4):S42-S49 (1990)). Similar
