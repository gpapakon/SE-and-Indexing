<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a device for camouflaging military equipment, the device consisting of a frame, which carries camouflage netting or similar camouflage equipment, and elastically or plastically deformable arms (1). In order to ensure that the device is simple to handle, each of the two ends of the elastically or plastically deformable arms (1) is attached to a connector element (2, 12, 22). When the two connector elements (2) are brought closer to each other, an irregular structure is formed virtually automatically, the shape of which can be altered in a variety of ways.

Device for camouflaging military equipment, 
consisting of a frame which has a plurality of 

carrying arms (1) and which carries a camouflage 
net or the like, one end of at least some of the 

carrying arms (1) being attached to a joining 
member (2,13,13',22) and the carrying arms (1) 

being designed to be resiliently deformable or 
ductile,
 
characterised in that
 
the ends of the carrying arms (1) facing one 

joining member (2,13,13'22) are attached to a 
second joining member (2,13,13',22), so that with 

the drawing together of the two joining members 
(2,13,13',22), the equipment to be camouflaged 

appears as an irregular shape. 
Device according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the joining member (2,13,13',22) is designed as a 

resiliently deformable or ductile part. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the ends of the resiliently deformable or ductile 

arms (1) are connected with the joining members 
(2) in the manner of a universal joint. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
between the two joining members (2,13,13',22) 

and/or individual arms (1) a tensioning part, e.g. 
a cord (9,10,11) is arranged, the length of which 

can be altered.  
 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
on at least one of the arms (1), a fixing link (6) 

or similar is arranged for fastening to the 
equipment (5) which is to be camouflaged. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
at least some of the resiliently deformable or 

ductile arms (1) have different cross-sections 
along their length. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, with 
arms consisting of sectional arms,
 
characterised in that
 
movable spring-like elements (17) or the like are 

coupled to the arms (la), which elements are 
preferably provided with a trimming. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that
 
the joining member is designed as a ring (22) 

which can be moved along a pipe. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that
 
there are coupled to arms (la), rods (25), the 

other ends of which are mounted rotatably on a 
sliding part, the rods (25) being able to be 

brought via a stretched position into a position 
holding the arms (la) in their camouflage 

position. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 9,
 
characterised in that  

 
the camouflage is designed as at least partially 

resilient.
