<ABSTRACT>
An inboard bearing retainer for use in a vehicle wheel 
assembly having a live spindle (12). The inboard bearing retainer (62) 

includes a retaining nut (64) adapted to be engaged to an outer 
diameter of the inboard end of the live spindle (12). The nut (64) 

including a flange (68) which provides inboard retention and restrains 
inboard movement of the wheel bearing relative to the live 

spindle. The nut (64) also includes a surface which at least 
partially defines the bearing seat (36) for the wheel bearing. The 

retaining nut (64) is engaged by a locking assembly mounted to the 
spindle's inboard end so as to prevent disengagement of the 

retainer nut from the spindle (12). In one embodiment, the locking 
assembly is a one-piece body having a bearing portion, a thrust 

washer portion and locking tabs which interferingly prevent 
dise
ngagement of the retainer nut from the live spindle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle wheel assembly including a 
rotating axle, a locking hub, a mounting member and a wheel 
bearing engaged with the mounting member. US-A-4 378 868 discloses a vehicle wheel assembly which has a 
live spindle supported by a wheel bearing for rotation relative 
to a mounting member, the live spindle having inboard and 
outboard ends and also having a central bore defined therein, 
through which extends an axle driven for a rotation. The vehicle 
wheel assembly has a hub lock for coupling the axle to 
the spindle and transferring rotation therebetween and comprises 
a bearing retainer adapted to engage an outer diameter 
on the inboard end of the live spindle for rotation therewith 
as well as locking means for preventing disengagement of said 
bearing retainer from the live spindle. US-A-4 331 210 shows a live spindle vehicle drive wheel assembly 
with axially movable axle. The axle is drivingly connected 
to the live spindle in a manner which allows axial movement of 
the axle relative to the spindle to relieve stress in a drive 
train which drives the axle. The wheel bearing assembly according to US-A-4 881 842 comprises 
an outer bearing member which is secured to a steering 
knuckle, and a hollow spindle which is rotatably supported in 
a fixed longitudinal relationship in an outer bearing member 
by two rows of bearing balls.  
 Vehicle wheel assemblies utilizing live spindles are found 
in motor vehicles capable of functioning in an four-wheel drive 
operational mode. The live spindle or hub is journaled or 
mounted for rotation within a mounting component of the wheel 
assembly. A wheel bearing is interposed between the mounting 
portion and the spindle enabling the spindle to rotate relative 
to the mounting portion. An axle shaft is rigidly connected to 
the live spindle and includes an inboard flange for retaining the 
bearing on the live spindle. If the vehicle is configured to 
operate in either a two-wheel or four-wheel drive mode, a center 
axle disconnect mechanism is provided to selectively couple the 
axle to the transmission. Motor vehicle wheel assemblies utilizing dead spindles are 
also capable of operating in either two-wheel or four-wheel drive 
modes. A hub lock may be provided to selectively couple the 
wheel assembly to the axle. The axle shaft typically extends  
 
through a central bore in the dead spindle end is journaled 
therein by a set of needle bearings or another type of bearing. 
Generally, the dead spindle is threaded on its outboard

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle wheel assembly (10) including a rotating axle (16), 
a locking hub (18), a mounting member and a wheel bearing (14) engaged 

with the mounting member, said assembly comprising: 

a live spindle (12) including a body having inboard end (74) and 
an outboard end (22), said body being rotatably supported by the wheel 

bearing (14) in the mounting member, a central bore (48) defined in said 
body and in which the axle (16) is supported for rotation, said body 

being connected at said outboard end (22) to the locking hub (18) for 
coupling to the axle (16) such that said live spindle (12) is driven in 

rotation by the axle (16), said body including exterior surfaces 
generally adjacent to said inboard end (74) defining at least part of 

a bearing seat (51) for the wheel bearing (14), said inboard end (74) 
of said live spindle (12) having portions defining at least one radial 

slot (72) therein; 
a bearing retainer (64) adapted to engage an exterior 
surface of said inboard end (74) for rotation with said live spindle 

(12), said bearing retainer (64) including portions defining a central 
aperture through which the axle (16) extends and providing a radial 

portion providing inboard bearing retention so as to restrain 
inboard movement of the wheel bearing (14) relative to said live 

spindle (12), said bearing retainer (64) including portions defining at 
least one radial slot (70) therein adjacent to said inboard end (74) 

of said live spindle (12); and
