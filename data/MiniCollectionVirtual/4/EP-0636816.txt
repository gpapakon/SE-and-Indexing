<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for diverting balls contained in a 
ball nut and screw device (10) into and out of a ball 

recirculation tube (50) includes a pair of apertures 
(21, 31) formed through the nut which extend from the 

outer surface thereof inwardly to the axial end of 
complementary helical threads (11a, 11b; 12a, 12b) 

formed on the screw (11) and the nut (12). Within each 
of the apertures (21, 31), a step (22, 32) is formed 

which extends partially about the inner surface 
thereof. A skirt deflector (40) is provided in each of 

the apertures (21, 31) for guiding the balls (13) into 
and out of the complementary threads. Each of the 

skirt deflectors (40) includes an upper flange portion 
(41) and a depending skirt portion (42). Pick-up 

fingers (45) extend downwardly from the lower ends of 
the skirt portions (42) further into each of the 

apertures (21, 31). A step (47) is defined between the 
skirt portion (42) and the pick-up finger (45) on each 

of the skirt deflectors (40). The steps (47) formed on 
the skirt deflectors (40) are positioned opposite the 

steps (22, 32) formed within the apertures (21, 31) 
when the skirt deflectors (40) are installed therein. 

A tube (50) is provided for transferring the balls (13) 
between the apertures (21, 31). When the tube (50) is 

installed, the lowermost ends thereof abut and are 
supported on the steps (22, 32) formed in the apertures 

and on the steps (47) formed on the skirt deflector 
(40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to ball nut and 
screw devices and in particular to an improved structure 
for diverting the balls contained in such a ball nut and 
screw device into and out of a ball recirculation tube. The ball nut and screw device is a well known 
apparatus which is designed to translate rotary motion of 
one member into linear motion of another member. A typical 
ball nut and screw device includes an elongated cylindrical 
screw which extends through a cylindrical opening formed 
through a nut. The outer surface of the screw and the 
inner surface of the nut are formed having complementary 
helical threads which are generally semi-circular in cross 
section. However, the outer diameter of the screw is 
smaller than the inner diameter of the opening formed 
through the nut. Thus, the outer surface of the screw and 
the inner surface of the opening formed through the nut do 
not engage one another. Rather, a plurality of balls are 
disposed between the screw and the nut. Each of the balls 
extends partially into both of the complementary threads 
formed in the screw and the nut so as to provide a rolling 
engagement therebetween, similar to a ball bearing 
apparatus. Typically, the screw is connected to a source or 
rotational power, while the nut is connected to a load to 
be moved. By virtue of its connection with the load, the 
nut is usually restrained from rotating. Thus, when the 
screw is rotated by the source of rotational power, the nut 
(and the load connected thereto) are moved axially relative 
to the screw. Because of the rolling engagement of the  
 
balls with the complementary threads of the screw and the 
nut, such linear movement of the nut is accomplished with 
very little friction. It will be appreciated that in some 
applications, it may be desirable to connect the screw to 
the load to be moved and the nut to the source of 
rotational power. However, as the balls roll through the complementary 
threads of the screw and the nut, they also roll axially 
therethrough. To accommodate this axial rolling movement 
of the balls, it is known to provide a mechanism for 
recirculating the balls from one end of the complementary 
threads to the other in an endless loop. This ball 
circulation mechanism typically includes a pair of 
apertures formed through the nut which extend outwardly 
from the opposite ends of the complementary threads to the 
outer surface of the nut. A tube extends across the outer 
surface of the nut between these two apertures. The tube 
conducts
