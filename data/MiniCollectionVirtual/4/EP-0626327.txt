<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for transforming a narrow single-track container stream (A) into a wide container stream (B). For this purpose, the device possesses, between a feed conveyor (1) and a discharge conveyor (3), a transformation region (2''') which is formed by a multiplicity of conveyor bands (10-19; 33-35; 36-41) laterally adjacent to one another and at which a deceleration of the containers (4) initially takes place at a deceleration zone (2'') in such a way that they are directly adjacent to one another in a single-track container stream (A), and at which the shaping of the wide container stream (B) then takes place along an oblique guide rail (5) on a transformation zone (2'''). The conveyor bands (10-19) of at least the transformation zone (2''') are narrow conveyor bands having a multiply staggered conveying speed.
