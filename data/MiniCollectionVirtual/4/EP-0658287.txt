<DESCRIPTION>
 PERMANENT MAGNET DIRECT CURRENT MOTORTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates generally to improvements in electric motors and specifically to improvements in direct current permanent magnet motors utilizing a brush/commutator current transfer system.BACKGROUNDDirect current permanent magnet electric motors are widely used in many applications. Recently there has been a trend towards increased usage of such motors in order to meet automotive engine cooling system requirements. Such motors are advantageous in that, for normal cruising speeds, the flow of air through an automotive radiator is sufficient, without the fan motor being operated, for adequate cooling of the engine. However, occasional traffic situations require minimal operation of the cooling fan at less than full speed, while extremely hot days or high heat load (such as when the air conditioner is in operation) full speed fan operation is necessary to provide sufficient engine cooling. Thus, in the automotive environment, multiple speed fans are desirable.A multiple speed automotive fan is shown in United States Patent 5,113,104 entitled "Structured Product Dynamoelectric Machine" issued to Blaettner et al. on May 12, 1992, said patent herein incorporated by reference.Permanent magnet DC motors utilize two or more brushes contacting a commutator which provides the direct current flow to the windings of the rotor, which in turn provide the desired magnetic repulsion/attraction with the permanent magnets located around the periphery of the 

motor. The brushes are conventionally located in brush boxes and utilize a U-shaped spring which biases the brush into contact with the commutator. Because such springs generally contact the brush at only two points (at the rear of the brush), the stability of the brush and accuracy of its positioning with respect to the commutator is adversely affected. The brushes can move from side to side in the brush box resulting in movement of the brush relative to the commutator and bouncing of the brush so as to interrupt contact with one or more commutator segments during operation of the motor. This resulting interruption in current flow to the motor can result in arcing at the brush/commutator interface and overheating of the brush, as well as decreased current flow to the motor and a resultant decrease in motor output and increase in motor noise.Prior art fan motors, especially those utilized in the automotive environment, have a difficult task in keeping the fan motor itself cool while performing its
