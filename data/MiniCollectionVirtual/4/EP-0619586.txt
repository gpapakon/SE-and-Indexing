<ABSTRACT>
An electrical energy-transforming equipment comprises a 
transformer (Tr) arranged within a cubicle, a current 

transformer (CT) and a potential transformer (PT) both 
connected to the transformer. The transformer (Tr), the 

current transformer (CT) and the potential transformer (PT) 
are molded in one piece. In another form of the electrical 

energy-transforming equipment, a transformer for 
distributing electric power, which is molded with an insulating 

material (22), such as a synthetic resin or a synthetic 
rubber, is molded in one piece with a current transformer 

(CT) and a potential transformer (PT) both connected 
thereto, with an insulating material (12), such as a synthetic 

resin or a synthetic rubber. The electrical energy-transforming 
equipment may further comprise a breaker (VCB) 

also molded in one piece with the rest thereof, with the 
insulating material (12). In the other form, a transformer 

which is molded with an insulating material (22), such as a 
synthetic resin or a synthetic rubber, is removably coupled 

with a current transformer (CT) and a potential transformer 
(PT) each molded with an insulating material (16), such 

that the current transformer (CT) and the potential transformer 
(PT) are electrically connected to the transformer 

(Tr) inside the insulating material (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical energy-transforming 
equipment, and more particularly to an electrical energy-transforming 
equipment for arrangement within a cubicle, 
which comprises a transformer for distributing electric 
power, a current transformer (CT), and a potential 
transformer (PT), all molded in one piece, thereby preventing 
an accident of electric shock from occurring, as well 
as making it possible to prevent the current transformer 
and the potential transformer from being deteriorated. Within cubicles provided in a substation or the like, there 
are arranged, around a transformer located in the center 
for distributing electric power, a current transformer for 
measuring an electric current, a potential transformer for 
measuring a voltage, a breaker, and the like, in a required 
configuration, and these devices are connected to each 
other via cables. As the transformer, a dry-type molded 
transformer is known, which is molded with a synthetic 
resin or the like for prevention of deterioration and for 
protection of insulation. Conventionally, devices of the electrical energy-transforming 
equipment, such as the transformer, the current 
transformer, and the potential transformer, are constructed 
in respective separate forms, and installed within 
each cubicle, so that connecting portions of the devices,  
 
and cables per se are exposed. When a worker enters such a 
cubicle for cleaning or maintenance of the devices forming 
the electrical energy-transforming equipment, he can touch, 
by accident, any of the exposed portions having a high voltage 
to receive an electric shock, which makes the cleaning 
or maintenance work very dangerous. Further, the separate 
arrangement of the devices is disadvantageous in that 
the work within the cubicle is troublesome, and that the 
interior space of the cubicle cannot be used efficiently 
enough, resulting in an increase in the size of the equipment. Further, an insect, a rat, or the like can occasionally 
enter the cubicle. In such an event, the insect, the rat 
or the like can touch an exposed portion having a high 
voltage to receive an electric shock and lie dead, thereby 
deteriorating or causing damage to the current transformer 
or the potential transformer. In short, the inside of the 
conventional cubicle is not provided with a measure 
effective enough to prevent a possible accident of electric 
shock received by a worker, or by a rat or the like. 
Therefore, the number of accidents of electric shock 
received by workers
