<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a box with a retention and protection 
element for a jar housed in the box. US-A-5 145 070 and 
GB-A-2 154 213 describe such a box. Boxes of cardboard or other material are often used for housing 
jars or bottles containing the most diverse products, such as 
creams, ointments, medicaments etc. In many cases the jars have to be securely retained and protected 
against impact and the like. In this case the jar is placed in a 
cavity or seat provided in a block of soft material, such as 
expanded polystyrene, which is inserted into the box. It is also 
known to insert into the box a supplementary structure, sometimes 
formed of the same material as the box, its purpose being to 
maintain the jar spaced from the side and/or base walls of the 
box. It is apparent that the use of a structure formed separately from 
the box and arranged to protect the jar in its box is costly and 
requires the use of special machines for inserting the structure 
into the box and then to house the jar inside the structure. The main object of the present invention is to provide a box in 
the form of a single piece of cardboard or other material, the box 
being able to retain and effectively protect a jar within the box 
and being of low cost and easy assembly at the moment of making up 
the package. This and further objects are attained by a box according to claim 1.  
 Preferably, said appendices extend from said elongate flaps 
and can be folded over about a further creasing line to be 
superposed on the remaining part of said flap within the finished 
box, in this appendix there being provided creasing lines which 
are substantially superposed on creasing lines of the elongate 
flaps when said appendices have been folded over onto the 
respective elongate flaps. Again preferably, in each of said elongate flaps there is provided 
a profiled aperture located between said supplementary creasing 
lines of said flap, said intermediate creasing lines intersecting 
the respective apertures which form a housing for said jar, which 
is retained raised from the adjacent end of the box and spaced 
from the side walls of said box.  
 The structure and characteristics of the box will be more apparent 
from the description of two preferred embodiments thereof given 
hereinafter by way of non-limiting example with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a plan view of a punched cardboard sheet usable for 
forming the box; Figure 2 shows the cardboard sheet of Figure 1 partly folded in a

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A box with at least one retention and protection element 
for a jar or the like, formed from a sheet of flexible material, 

in particular cardboard, provided with four consecutive main 
panels (1-4) separated from each other by parallel creasing lines (5-7), 

with flaps (9-12) and, for forming the two ends of the box, with two 
respective closure panels (13-14) projecting from the free ends of the 

main panels (1-4) and separated from them by creasing lines (17-21) 
perpendicular to those(5-7) separating the panels from each other, 

two elongate flaps (9, 10) projecting from two separate main panels (1, 3) 
from at least one and the same side of the panels between 

which main panels (1, 3) there is interposed a further main panel (2) 
in each of said elongate flaps (9, 10) there being provided two supplementary 

creasing lines (23, 24;) parallel to the creasing line (17, 18) 
which separates said flap (9, 10) from the main panel (1, 3) from 

which it projects, there being provided an intermediate creasing line 
(27;) in each elongate flap (9, 10) between said supplementary 

creasing lines (23, 24;) and parallel to them, said two elongate flaps (9, 10) being 
folded over along their respective creasing lines (17,18;23,24;27;) 

within the box formed from said cardboard sheet 
with one of their portions (26,) being fixed to the 

interior of the main panel (1, 3) from which said flap (9, 10) projects 
to form a support for supporting a jar (140), which is kept raised from 

the adjacent end of the box, characterised in that each one of said flaps (9, 10) has 
an appendix or a tab (40, 41; 50) rotatable to be placed upon at least the flap portion 

between its intermediate creasing line (27) and its supplementary creasing line (23) 
closer to the adjacent main panel (1, 3) to stiffen the same flap portion.  

 
A box as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said appendices 
(40, 41) extend from said elongate flaps (9, 10) and 

can be folded over about a further creasing line (45) to be superposed 
on the remaining part of said flap within the finished box, in this 

appendix (40, 41) there being provided creasing lines (43, 46) which 
are substantially superposed on creasing lines (23, 24) of the elongate  

 
flaps (9, 10) when said appendices (40, 41) have been folded over 

onto the respective elongate flaps (9, 10). 
A box as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that in each 
of said elongate flaps (9, 10;) there is provided a profiled 

aperture (25,) located between said supplementary creasing lines 
(23, 24;) of said flap, said intermediate creasing lines (27,) 

intersecting the respective aperture (25,) which form a housing for 
said jar (140) which is retained raised from the adjacent end (13) 

of the box and spaced from the side walls (1-4) of said box. 
A box as claimed in claims 2 and 3, characterised in that 
in said appendices (40, 41) of said elongate flaps (9, 10) there is 

provided a supplementary profiled aperture (42) substantially 
superimposable on the aperture provided in the respectiv
e flap (9, 10) 
when said appendices (40, 41) are folded over onto the respective 

elongate flaps (9, 10). 
A box according to claim 1, characterised in that a shaped cut is made through 
that portion of each elongate flap (9, 10) which is closer to the respective main 

panel (1, 3), said shaped cut extending from the adjacent supplementary creasing 
line (23) to define said appendix (50) which is foldable about the same 

supplementary creasing line (23).
