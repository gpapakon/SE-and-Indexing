<ABSTRACT>
Method for manipulating a product stream, in which the product 
stream is guided by means of conveying elements along a conveyor 

successively past a number of processing elements, said processing 
elements being controlled depending on a central control system for 

making the control elements operate in phase with the product stream, and 
for this purpose the central control system transmits control signals and 

receives detection signals on the position of the conveying elements, and 
in which according to the invention said central control system controls 

said control elements and also the conveying elements essentially 
independently of each other on the basis of an internal reference signal 

which is adapted, possibly temporarily, depending on detection signals 
coming from detectors if a certain preset threshold value is exceeded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for manipulating a stream of 
products, in which the products move successively downstream in a 
virtually uninterrupted movement, possibly intermittently. The invention 
also relates to a device for carrying out said method. In particular, the 
invention relates to the manipulation of astream of products in a packing 
machine, more particularly a so-called flowpacker. In this case an 
initially flat continuous web or strip of packaging material is folded or 
bent with the longitudinal edges towards each other in the form of a tube 
around the essentially continuously moving product stream, and is then 
divided into successive pieces or pouches sealed in the lengthwise and 
crosswise direction and containing one or more products from the product 
stream. However, the invention is not restricted thereto, and can also be 
applied to other areas of product stream manipulation, such as in respect 
of product conveyors with buffer facility etc. In this case the invention 
is essentially applicable in the field of product streams with relatively 
high speeds, in the case of which a product passage of, for example, 500 
items per min. or more is achieved, as is currently the norm in the foods 
and consumer industry for articles of relatively small dimensions, such 
as biscuits, crackers, chocolate bars and pieces of cheese, but also 
screws, nuts, lamps for light fittings and the like. It is known from the packaging industry for foods that in the 
case of the so-called flowpacker the various drive units thereof for 
supplying the continuous web of packaging material, sealing jaws and 
cutting elements are speed-controlled depending on the product infeed 
movement. For this purpose, use is currently being made of an electronic 
control system in which a detection element on the product supply belt, 
generally an encoder on the drive shaft, transmits a signal which is used 
as a reference signal, on the basis of which the drive of the various 
elements in the packing machine connected downstream are controlled. In 
control engineering this control is also sometimes called a master-slave 
control system, in the case of which the master is coupled to the product 
supply. A flowpacker with such a control system is described in, for 
example, EP-A-0,339,134. The disadvantage of this known master-slave control system is 
the limited capacity of the flowpacker or other type of product 
processing machine. A machine operating by such a master-slave control 
system is also subject to

Method for manipulating a product stream, in which the product 
stream is guided by means of conveying elements along a conveyor 

successively past a number of processing elements, said processing 
elements being controlled depending on a central control system for 

making the control elements operate in phase with the product stream, and 
for this purpose the central control system transmits control signals and 

receives detection signals on the position of the conveying elements, 
wherein said central control system controls said control elements and 

also the conveying elements essentially independently of each other on 
the basis of an internal, essentially constant reference signal which is 

adapted, possibly temporarily, depending on detection signals coming from 
detectors if a certain preset threshold value is exceeded. 
Method according to Claim 1 wherein for each individually 
controlled processing or conveying element an optimum course of the 

position is calculated within separate control circuits (P1..P4), each of 
which receives (R1...R4) feedback signals from position and detection 

elements (R1...R4) which are coupled to the drive elements (M1...M4) 
controlled by the control circuits. 
Method according to Claim 2, wherein one or more of the 
individual control circuits each receive signals from detectors which 

indicate the position of the products in the product stream, which 
signals are used for determining the optimum course of the position of 

the corresponding processing or conveying element. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein first 
the reference signal is adapted, as a result of which the speed of each 

processing and conveying element is first adapted in the same degree and 
direction, and then the optimum position curve is determined for each of 

said elements individually. 
Device for carrying out the method according to one of the 
preceding claims, in which the drivers, preferably electric motors 

(M1...M4), coupled to the drive shafts of both the processing elements 
(13, 14, 15) and to those of the conveying elements (3, 7) are each 

coupled to an output of the central control system (19), and a detection 
element, for example an encoder (R1...R4), is coupled to each of said 

shafts, which detection elements are in signalling communication with an 
input of the central control system, in order to form a feedback circuit.
