Internal combustion engine (1) with an electrical starter (3), a starter 
battery (4), a starter switch (5) in the circuit between the starter battery 

and the starter and a cut-off relay (6) provided in the starter circuit, 
which interrupts the starter circuit when the internal combustion engine 

(1) is running, a frequency signal generator giving off a frequency signal 
proportional to the rotation speed of the internal combustion engine for 

controlling the cut-off relay (6), and a switch arrangement (7) including a 
frequency relay connected to the latter, which brings the frequency signal 

of the frequency signal generator to "opening of the starter circuit" when 
the frequency signal of the frequency signal generator exceeds an initial 

operating frequency being provided, where, furthermore, the switch 
arrangement (7) includes an initial time-delay element and brings the cut-off 

relay for a first time interval (Δt₁) to "opening of the starter circuit" 
when the starter switch (5) is opened,
 
characterized in that the switch arrangement (7) includes a second time-delay 

element and brings the cut-off relay (6) beyond this for a second 
time interval (Δt₂) to "opening of the starter circuit" when, in the case of 

reducing frequency of the frequency signal as a result of a falling engine 
speed, the frequency signal falls below a second operating frequency of the 

frequency relay. 
Internal combustion engine according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that, according to the direction of the change in frequency 

of the frequency signal, the frequency relay has two different switch 
points, the initial operating frequency (F₁) being greater, in the case of 

increasing frequency of the frequency signal, than the second operating 
frequency (F₂) in the case of falling frequency of the frequency signal. 
Internal combustion engine according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the circuit is manufactured by the SMD technology 

and is encapsulated in a casing free from vibration and that the casing is 
directly built onto the internal combustion engine. 
Internal combustion engine according to Claim 1, with a three-phase light  
 

generator (2) driven by the internal combustion engine (1), characterized 
in that the terminal "W" of the light generator is connected as frequency 

signal outlet to the switch arrangement (7). 
Internal combustion engine according to Claim 1, characterized in that a 
Hall generator is provided as a frequency signal generator. 
Internal combustion engine according to Claim 1, characterized in that a 
separate inductive frequency generator is provided as a frequency signal 

generator. 
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 5 or 6, 
characterized in that the frequency signal generator is provided on a 

rotating part of the internal combustion engine (e.g. a disc, journal, 
starter gear).
