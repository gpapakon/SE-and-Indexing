<ABSTRACT>
The working-up of zinc- and lead-bearing metallurgical plant residues is carried out by thermal treatment in a circulating fluidised bed, the heat requirement being met by combustion of solid carbon in the fluidised-bed reactor of the circulating fluidised bed. The solid carbon content in the lower part of the fluidised bed is adjusted to 5 to 30%. Oxygen-containing gases are introduced into the upper part of the fluidised-bed reactor, and the formation of CO2 is taken only so far that metallic zinc is not reoxidised. The discharged suspension is largely freed of solids in a return cyclone, and the solids are recycled. The gas is cooled to a temperature at which the metallic zinc is oxidised to ZnO, and the zinc and lead compounds in the form of dust are precipitated from the gas.

A method for regenerating residual metallurgical
materials containing iron oxides, zinc and lead by heat

treatment in a circulating fluidised bed at elevated
temperatures and under reducing conditions, wherein

zinc and lead are volatilised and higher iron oxides
are reduced at most to FeO, and evaporated zinc and

lead are separated off from the exhaust gas after
cooling, a fluidising gas is introduced into the lower

part of the fluidised bed reactor of the circulating
fluidised bed, a content of solid carbon of 5 to 30% is

set in the lower part in the fluidised bed, the
reduction potential in the lower part of the fluidised

bed reactor is set by selecting the quantity and
composition of the fluidising gas such that at least

80% of the iron content is present as Fe
2+
, at most 1%
as metallic iron and the remainder as Fe
3+
, oxygen-containing
secondary gas is introduced into the upper

part of the fluidised bed reactor, solid carbon-containing
material is introduced into the lower part

of the fluidised bed reactor beneath the feed point for
the secondary gas, but the CO
2
 formation is only
effected to such an extent that metallic zinc is not

reoxidised, the suspension discharged from the upper
part of the fluidised bed reactor is passed into the

recycle cyclone of the circulating fluidised bed and is
largely freed of solids therein, solids separated off

are returned to the fluidised bed reactor such that
within the circulating fluidised bed the hourly

circulation of solids is at least 5 times the weight of
solids located in the fluidised bed reactor, the gas

emerging from the recycle cyclone is cooled to a
temperature at which the metallic zinc is oxidised to

ZnO and the dust-like zinc and lead compounds are
separated out from the gas, characterised in that as 

fluidising gas air is blown into the fluidised bed
reactor in a quantity which contains 10 to 50% of the

required quantity of oxygen and the rest of the
quantity of oxygen is introduced with the secondary

gas, solid carbon-containing material with high and
with low reactivity is introduced into the lower part

of the fluidised bed reactor beneath the feed point for
the secondary gas, with low-gas or degasified coal

having less than 10% volatile constituents being used
as the material with low reactivity, that up to 20% of

the carbon-containing material introduced into the
lower part of the fluidised bed reactor consists of

carbon-containing material with low reactivity, the
quantity of the solid carbon-containing material added

is adjusted such that by predominant combustion of the
carbon-containing material with high reactivity at a

CO/CO
2
 ratio of 0.5 to 1.5 a temperature of 900 to
1100°C is set.
