<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for enhancing data transmission in a digital cellular radio network. The arrangement comprises a radio data terminal (A), a network terminating unit (IWF) connected to a mobile exchange (MSC) and comprising a data modem (MOD1), and a remote data modem (MOD2). The radio data terminal (A) and the remote data modem (MOD2) comprise data compression and decompression. The digitatl transmission connection between the radio data terminal (A) and the data modem (MOD1) is a non-transparent asynchronous data connection of a cellular radio system, over which compressed data is transmitted using the error correction of the cellular system. The error correction protocol of the remote modem is used for the transmission of compressed data over the modem connection between the data modem (MOD1) and the remote data modem (MOD2). At the beginning of a data session the data modem transmits compression parameters to the radio data terminal; these parameters are determined on the basis of a handshaking procedure between the data modem and the remote data modem.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for
enhancing data transmission in a digital cellular radio
network.In the European mobile telephone system GSM it
is possible to establish a circuit switched data transmission
connection or traffic channels so as to enable
a data terminal connected to the data interface of a
mobile radio unit to transfer data to and from a data
modem in a mobile exchange and further by means of a
modem link to and from another data modem and a data
terminal connected to it. The maximum transmission rate
of such data transmission is determined by the maximum
capacity of the data channel established over the radio
path, e.g. 9600 bit/s in the GSM system. In many applications
there exists, however, a need for considerably
higher transmission rates of user data.An object of the present invention is to
enhance data transmission in a digital cellular radio
network.According to the invention, an arrangement for
enhancing data transmission in a digital cellular radio
network which uses an error correction portocol, said arrangement comprising a radio data
terminal; a network terminating unit connected to a
mobile exchange and comprising a data modem; a remote
data modem which uses its own error correction protocol; and call control means for establishing a
digital transmission connection between the radio data
terminal and the data modem and a modem connection 
between the data modem and the remote data modem, is
characterized in that the radio data terminal and the
remote data modem comprise means for transmitting data
in a compressed form, the digital transmission connection
between the mobile radio data terminal and the data
modem is a non-transparent asynchronous data connection
of a cellular radio system, over which connection the
compressed data is transmitted using, for error correction, only the error correction
protocol of the cellular system, and the data modem of the
network terminating unit comprises means for transmitting
compressed data over said modem connection by
using the error correction protocol of the remote modem
and for transmitting compression parameters to the radio
data terminal at the beginning of a data session, said
parameters being determined on the basis of a handshaking
procedure between the data modem and the remote
data modem.According to the invention, user data is transmitted
between a radio data terminal and a remote data
modem in a compressed form, whereby any possible
redundancy has been removed from the data stream, and
thus the amount of data to
