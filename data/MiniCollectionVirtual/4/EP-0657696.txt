<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger for a combustion apparatus capable of 
providin
g satisfactory sealing between an open end of an 
oxidizing agent duct and a regenerative structure. A regenerator 

(8) includes a high-temperature section constituted by a 
regenerative unit (10) made of a ceramic material and a low-temperature 

section constituted by a regenerative unit (9) made 
of a metal material. The regenerator is formed with a plurality 

of communication passages which permit a combustion chamber and a 
suction/exhaust duct structure (22) to communicate with each 

other. The communication passages are provided by a plurality of 
through-holes formed in the regenerative units. The number of 

the through-holes and an equivalent diameter thereof are 
determined so as to permit a pressure loss gradient in the low-temperature 

section positioned on the side of the suction/exhaust 
duct structure to be larger than that in the high-temperature 

section positioned on the side of the combustion chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a heat exchanger for
a combustion chamber, and more particularly with a heat
exchanger with an air-pervious regenerator adapted to be
heated by exhaust gas from the chamber and then preheat an
oxidizing agent for combustion in the chamber by the thus-heated
air-pervious regenerator.A heat recovery type combustion apparatus in which a
conventional rotary heat exchanger is incorporated is
disclosed by way of example in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open Publication No. 222102/1989. The conventional
rotary heat exchanger disclosed is constructed so as to
rotate an air-pervious regenerative member or regenerator
made of a ceramic material with respect to a
suction/exhaust duct structure, to thereby carry out heat
exchange. Also, the conventional heat exchanger is
constructed so as to provide an air passage for guiding
air acting as an oxidizing agent to a combustion chamber
in an exhaust passage for guiding exhaust gas discharged
from the combustion chamber and terminate a part of a
partition for partitioning the air passage and exhaust
passage from each other at a position apart from the air-pervious
regenerator, to thereby permit the air passage
and exhaust passage to partially communicate with each
other. Unfortunately, partial communication between the
air passage and the exhaust passage causes fluid to flow
from a high-pressure fluid side through a communication
section therebetween into a low-pressure fluid side, so
that the heat exchanger requires to employ a forced draft
fan for feeding combustion air to an air duct and an
induced-draft fan for drawing exhaust gas out of an
exhaust duct which are increased in capacity in view of
such flowing of fluid into the low-pressure fluid side.
Also, this fails to permit the heat exchanger to be
increased in heat transfer efficiency and heat recovery,
leading to a failure to 
satisfactorily increase energy saving of the heat exchanger. In
view of the problem, the assignee proposed techniques wherein a
seal structure is provided between an open end of an air duct and
an air-pervious regenerator to minimize leakage of combustion air
from an air passage to an exhaust passage, to thereby permit both
a forced-draft fan for feeding of combustion air and an
induced-draft fan for suction of exhaust gas to be decreased in
capacity.Such a conventional rotary heat exchanger as described
above is likewise disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Publication No. 241436/1994, U.S. Patent No. 5,275,556, U.K.
