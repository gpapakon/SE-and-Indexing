System for analysing sample fluids comprising

a test element diskette (22) in which two or more
test elements (25) are placed in a circular

arrangement and individually sealed,
a slide (19) which is used to push a test element
out of the test element diskette during which the

test element pierces a seal and is transported to a
site for measurement, and
a measuring arrangement for detecting changes
occurring on the test element.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the measuring
arrangement comprises a source of radiation and a

detector.
System as claimed in claim 1, wherein it comprises
a transport mechanism having a lever (4) and a

rotatable holder (5) which is used to radially move
the arrangement of test elements.
System as claimed in claim 1, wherein the slide
(19) carries a spike (20) at one end which pierces

the test element diskette and a test element is
pushed out of the test element diskette by the

spike. 
System as claimed in one of the previous claims
which has a reading device for data for the test

element diskette.
System as claimed in claim 1, in which the test

element diskette is manufactured from two foils
which are glued or welded and between which the

test elements are sealed in.
System as claimed in claim 6, in which one of the
foils has depressions to insert the test elements.
System as claimed in claim 1 or 6, in which the
test elements have a tip or edge which facilitates

the piercing of the seal.
Method for analysing sample fluids comprising the
steps:


unsealing a test element (25) from a test element
diskette (22) in which two or more test elements

are placed in a circular arrangement and are
individually sealed by a device which comprises a

slide (19),
transporting the test element (25) out of the test
element diskette using the slide (19) during which

the test element pierces a seal and reaches the
site for sample application,
applying a sample on the test element (25),
carrying out a measurement with the test element, 
reading a measuring result on a display (7).
Method as claimed in claim 9 for analysing
components of body fluids.
Method as claimed in claim 9, in which data are
read by the system which relate to the test

elements (25) used for the analysis.
Method as claimed in claim 9, in which the
measurement process is started by applying the

sample to the test element (25).
Method as claimed in claim 9, in which the test
element diskette is located in a holder (5) which

is used to rotate the test element diskette.
Method as claimed in claim 13, in which the test
element diskette is rotated by an angle of 360Â°/n

in which n is the number of test elements arranged
in the test element diskette.
Method as claimed in claim 9, in which a test
element is unsealed by piercing the test element

diskette with a spike (20) which is mounted on the
slide (19) and pressing the test element out of the

test element diskette during which the test element
pierces a seal.
