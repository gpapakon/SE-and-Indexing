Described herein is a low volume 
photographic material processing apparatus (10) which 

comprises a container (11) having a narrow horizontal

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to photographic
processing apparatus and is more particularly
concerned with a modular processing channel for such
processors.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. These steps
lend themselves to mechanization by conveying a
continuous web of film or cut sheets of film or
photographic paper sequentially through a series of
stations or tanks, each one containing a different
processing liquid appropriate to the process step at
that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes rack and tank configurations which
contain approximately 100 liters of each processing
solution. A small photofinishing apparatus or
microlab utilizes rack and tank configurations which
may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.The prior art suggests that if the volume of
the various tanks contained within various sizes of
photographic processing apparatus were reduced the
same amount of film or photographic paper may be
processed, while reducing the volume of photographic
solution that was used and subsequently discarded.
One of the problems in using smaller volume tanks is
that the inner and outer sections of the tank
typically are fixed and not separable. Another
problem in using low volume tanks is that the material 
being processed typically has a tendency to jam.
Hence, it was difficult and time-consuming to separate
the rack from the tank for cleaning and maintenance
purposes.One prior art low volume photographic
material processing apparatus utilized photographic
tanks having an inner rack section and an outer tank
section which are easily separated. The processing
apparatus contained a smaller volume of the same
photographic solution than was previously used in
regular-sized processing tanks. In fact, in some
instances, the volume of photographic solution
utilized in regular-sized tanks was reduced by as much
as 90%. This apparatus permitted the inner rack
section of the tank to be easily separated from the
outer tank, while providing a narrow channel for both
the photosensitive material and the processing
solution.U.S. Patent 5,179,404 discloses a processing
apparatus wherein a narrow processing channel is
formed between a rack and a tank. The photosensitive
material is transported through the narrow channel by
appropriate rollers contained in the rack and tank.The prior art used
