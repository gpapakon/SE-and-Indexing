<ABSTRACT>
A parallel IIR filter (100) has low quantization effects and 
includes a multiplier (103) which multiplies a digital input signal 

by a constant, and an arbitrary number of biquad filters (104, 
105). Outputs of the multiplier (103) and each biquad filter (104, 

105) are summed together in a summing device (106) to provide 
an output signal of the IIR filter (100). The IIR filter (100) first 

expresses its transfer function as a cascade form transfer 
function, and then calculates the constant as a product of a 

constant term of each cascade form biquad term. The IIR filter 
(100) partially decomposes the cascade form transfer function to 

provide first order terms, and calculates numerator coefficients 
of the first-order terms. Pairs of decomposed terms are 

recombined to provide a parallel form transfer function, from 
which parallel form coefficients are taken and applied to the 

biquad filters (104, 105).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrical filters, and 
more particularly, to digital filters. Infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter structures have 
been studied for more than thirty years. IIR filters generally fall 
into two types, cascade and parallel. The parallel IIR filter 
theoretically provides less noise, i.e., provides a higher signal-to-noise 
ratio. However, for two major reasons most IIR filters 
are nonetheless implemented using the cascade form. First, the 
parallel form is considered to be computationally expensive. See, 
for example, L. Jackson, Digital Filters and Signal Processing, 
Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1986, at page 202. The cascade IIR 
filter requires 25-50 percent fewer multiply operations than 
required for the parallel IIR filter, thus saving processing 
hardware and instruction cycles. For these practical reasons, the 
cascade form is often preferred. Second, known parallel IIR filters suffer from reduced 
performance due to quantization errors. These quantization 
errors reduce signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and can arise from two 
sources. First, commercially-available digital signal processors 
(DSPs) can create quantization errors when implementing the 
biquad filters of the IIR filter. The microelectronics revolution 
has provided DSPs with sophisticated data addressing modes and 
high arithmetic precision. Nonetheless, commercially available 
DSPs do not provide the precision required to avoid creating 
quantization errors. While these DSPs perform the repetitive 
arithmetic operations required for IIR filters in a high-precision 
arithmetic logic unit (ALU), sometimes the precision is lost. For 
example, the high operand precision is lost when an operand must  
 
be stored in memory to implement a time delay. This lost 
precision results in quantization error. Second, quantization errors occur when the IIR filter 
polynomial is decomposed to determine the parallel form 
coefficients. The desired transfer function of the filter is easily 
expressed in cascade form, that is, as a product of some number 
of biquad terms. Determination of cascade-form coefficients is 
easy because only second-order decomposition of each biquad 
term is involved. In theory, the parallel form of the transfer 
function can be obtained directly from the cascade form. 
However, in practice it is very difficult to generate parallel-form 
filter coefficients directly from the cascade form transfer 
function. Conversion from the given cascade filter coefficients 
to the parallel
