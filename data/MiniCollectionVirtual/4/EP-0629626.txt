<ABSTRACT>
A fulgide or fulgimide compound of formula (I) having a cyclopropyl 
group as a substituent has excellent durability as a 

compound which changes reversibly in color from a colorless 

form to a colored form by the action of light containing 
ultraviolet rays such as sunlight or the light from a 

mercury lamp. There are also provided processes for its 
production, a composition comprising it, and its use in 

e.g. photochromic lenses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel compound
having a photochromic action, processes for producing
it, a composition comprising it, and to its use. More
specifically, it relates to a novel compound having
excellent durability which changes reversibly in color
from a colorless form to a colored form by the action
of light containing ultraviolet rays such as sunlight
or the light from a mercury lamp, processes for its
production, a composition comprising it, and to its
use.Photochromism, which has aroused a particular
interest for the last several years, denotes a
phenomenon in which when light containing ultraviolet
rays such as sunlight or the light from a mercury lamp
is irradiated onto a certain compound, its color
rapidly changes, and when the light irradiation is
stopped and the compound is placed in a dark place, its
color reversibly returns to the original color.
Compounds having this property are called photochromic
compounds. Photochromic compounds of various
structures have been synthesized and proposed, but no
particular common structure has been observed in these
compounds.Under the circumstances, Japanese Laid-open
Patent Application No. 155,179/1985 and the
corresponding British Laid-open Patent Application No.
2,146,327 disclose a photochromic compound represented
by the following formula
 
   wherein

represents an adamantylidene
group which may be substitued, R1 represents
hydrogen, an alkyl group, an aryl group, an
aralkyl group or a heterocyclic group, X
represents oxygen or >NR'1 in which R'1
represents hydrogen, an aryl group, an alkyl
group or an aralkyl group, and

represents an aromatic group, an
unsaturated heterocyclic group or a
heterocyclic group to which a benzene ring is
bound,
and use of the photochromic compound in a photoreactive
lens.Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
28,154/1990 and the corresponding U.S. Patent No.
4,882,438 describe a fulgide compound or a fulgimide
compound represented by the following formula

These compounds are stably colorless in a normal state.
However, as soon as they undergo irradiation with
sunlight or ultraviolet light, they are colored. When
the irradiation stops, they return to the colorless
state. Tese compounds can repeatedly exhibit the color
change with good durability and hence, are compounds
having excellent photochromic property. In the above
fulgide compounds or fulgimide compounds,

represents an aromatic hydrocarbon group or an 
unsaturated heterocyclic group, R2 represents a
hydrocarbon group or a heterocyclic group, and
