<ABSTRACT>
A hydrophilic fibers modified with a substantially 
water-insoluble inorganic compound is produced by 

immersing hydrophilic fibers, for example, pulp fibers, 
in an aqueous solution of a water-soluble inorganic 

compound (a) which is precipiTated when brought into 
contact with a precipitant (b), adjusting the amount of 

the aqueous solution impregnated in the hydrophilic 
fibers to 60 to 40% based on the weight of the 

hydrophilic fibers, and bringing the hydrophilic fibers 
with the aqueous solution of the inorganic compound (a) 

into contact with the precipitant in the state of an 
aqueous solution to thereby cause the resultant 

substantially water-insoluble compound to be precipitated 
in and fixed to the hydrophilic fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing hydrophilic fibers with a water-insoluble
inorganic substance. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a process for producing hydrophilic
fibers modified with a substantially water-insoluble
inorganic substance, for example, a substantially water-insoluble
metal hydroxide, precipitated in and fixed to
bores, pores and surfaces of the hydrophilic fibers, to
provide modified hydrophilic fibers useful as a paper-forming
material, a shaped article-forming material, and
other functional materials in which the specific
functions of the substantially water-insoluble inorganic
substance carried by the hydrophilic fibers are utilized.Various processes for producing hydrophilic
fibers, for example, paper-forming pulp fibers, modified
with a substantially water-insoluble hydroxide, for
example, aluminum hydroxide, are known from Japanese
Examined Patent Publication No. 56-18,712, which
discloses a process wherein fine particles of aluminum
hydroxide are adhered to surfaces of a paper sheet by a
coating method; from Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. 57-144,754, which discloses a process
wherein a paper sheet containing 70% by weight or more of
aluminum hydroxide is formed from a pulp slurry
containing an aluminum hydroxide powder; and from
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57-171,799,
which discloses a process wherein a paper sheet
containing 50 to 95% by weight of aluminum hydroxide is
produced from a pulp slurry containing an aluminum
hydroxide powder together with a sizing agent and binder. In these conventional processes, the
substantially water-insoluble inorganic substance are
adhered in the form of fine particles to a surface of a
paper sheet, or mixed in the form of fine particles to
provide a pulp slurry, but a water-soluble inorganic
compound is not utilized to provide the substantially
water-insoluble inorganic substance.As conventional methods wherein a water-soluble
inorganic substance, for example sodium aluminate, is
utilized for paper-making, Chizhov, G.I. et al., Mezhvuz,
Sb. Mauch. Tr., Khimiya Tekhnol. Tsellyulozy, No. 8,
67-70 (1981) discloses a use of sodium aluminate mixed to
a pulp, to enhance a mechanical strength of the resultant
paper sheet; U.S.-A-3,706,629 discloses an
addition of a polymeric electrolyte and an aluminate of
an alkali metal to a pulp, to improve the dehydration
property and retention of the pulp in the paper-forming
step; and Canadian -A-964,808 teaches an addition
of a water-soluble

<CLAIMS>
A process for modifying hydrophilic fibers with
a substantially water-insoluble inorganic compound comprising

the steps of:

A) immersing hydrophilic fibers in an aqueous
solution comprising 6 to 60% by weight of a

water-soluble inorganic compound (a) which is
converted to a substantially water-insoluble

inorganic compound when brought into contact
with a precipitant (b) to impregnate the

hydrophilic fibers with the aqueous solution of
the water-soluble inorganic compound (a);
B) bringing the impregnated hydrophilic
fibers into contact with an aqueous solution of

the precipitant (b) to cause the resultant
substantially water-insoluble inorganic

compound to be precipitated in and fixed to the
hydrophilic fibers, characterized in that

before bringing the impregnated hydrophilic
fibers into contact with the precipitant (b),

the amount of the water-soluble inorganic
compound (a) aqueous solution impregnated in

the hydrophilic fibers is adjusted to a level
of 60 to 400% based on the dry weight of the

hydrophilic fibers by removing almost all of
the water-soluble inorganic compound (a)

aqueous solution from the surface and from the
surrounding of the hydrophilic fibers.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
hydrophilic fibers are selected from polyvinylalcohol fibers,

polyacrylamide fibers and lignocellulosic fibers.
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
cellulosic fibers are pulp fibers.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
water-soluble inorganic compound (a) is selected from water

soluble alkaline earth metal salts, and the precipitant (b)
comprises an aqueous solution containing at least one member

selected from fluorine, phosphate, carbonate, sulfate, borate
and chromate ions.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
water-soluble inorganic compound (a) is selected from

aluminates, silicates and zincates of alkali metals, and the
precipitant (b) comprises an aqueous solution containing a

mineral acid capable of converting the above-mentioned water-soluble
compounds to corresponding substantially water-insoluble

compounds.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
water-soluble inorganic compound (a) is selected from water-soluble

and the precipitant (b) comprises an aqueous solution of

ammonia.
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
water soluble salts of metallic elements other than alkali

metals are selected from nitrates, chlorides, and sulfates, of
zinc, aluminum, cobalt, zirconium, tin, titanium, iron,

copper, lead, magnesium, cadmium, mercury and chromium.
