<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus that uses a large transflective mirror to extend a virtual reality system such as a virtual table that employs a projection plane to produce the virtual reality. The transflexive mirror is positioned relative to the projection plane such that the plane of the mirror intersects the projection plane and the angle of the mirror relative to the projection plane is such that the user of the system who looks at the mirror sees the projection plane reflected in the mirror. The virtual reality system is responsive to the position of the mirror and the direction in which a user is looking and produces separate virtual realities on the projection plane: one when the user is looking at the mirror and another when the user is looking at the projection plane. The virtual reality that the user sees when looking at the mirror may or may not be coherent with the virtual reality that the user sees when looking at the projection plane. The two virtual realities may share a global coordinate system that is divided into two parts by the plane of the mirror, and what the user sees when looking into the mirror may be what the user would see looking through a window into the part of the global coordinate system behind the mirror. Because the mirror is transflective, real objects whose locations are known to the virtual reality system can be placed behind the mirror and the virtual reality reflected in the mirror may be used to augment the real objects. One use of such augmentation is virtual trial assembly of a virtual mockup with a physical mockup.

<DESCRIPTION>
 The Extended Virtual Table: An Optical Extension for Table-LikeProjection SystemsCross references to related applications This patent application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/209,672, O. Bimber, et al., Extended virtual table, filed 6 JUN 2000 and from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/210,315, O. Bimber, et al, Extended virtual table, filed 8 PUN 2000 and will be a continuation-in-part of the US national stage patent application corresponding to PCT/US99/28930 M. Encarnacaδ, et al., Tools for interacting with virtual environments, filed 7 December 1999 with a priority date of 22 April 1999. The application contains the complete discussion of the use of mirrors in virtual tables from PCT/US99/28930. It additionally contains an appendix of references cited in the application's new material.Background of the invention 1. Field of the inventionThe invention relates generally to virtual and augmented environments and more specifically to the application of mirror beam-splitters as optical combiners in combination with table-like projection systems that are used to visualize such environments.2. BackgroundVirtual Reality (VR) attempts to provide a sense of spatial presence (visual, auditory, or tactile) inside computer-generated synthetic environments to the user. Opaque head-mounted displays (HMDs) and surround-screen (spatially immersive) displays such as CANEs, (Cruz-Νeira, Sandin & DeFanti, 1993) and domed displays (Bennett, 2000) are NR devices that surround the viewer with graphics by filling a great amount of the user's field of view. To achieve this kind of immersion, however, these devices encapsulate the user from the real world, thus making it in many cases difficult or even impossible to combine them with habitual work environments. Other, less immersive display technology is more promising to support seamless integration of NR into everyday workplaces. Table-like display devices such as Virtual Tables (Barco Inc., 2000a, 

2000b) or Responsive Workbenches (Krϋger & Frδhlich, 1994; Krtiger, et al., 1995) and wall-like projection systems such as e.g., Powerwalls, (Silicon Graphics, Inc., 1997) allow the user to simultaneously perceive the surrounding real world while working with a virtual environment. UNC's "Office of the Future Vision" (Raskar, et al., 1998) is a consequent extension of this concept. Here, in contrast to embedding special display devices into the real work environment, an office is envisioned where the ceiling lights are replaced by cameras and
