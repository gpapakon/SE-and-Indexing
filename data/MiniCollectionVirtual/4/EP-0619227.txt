<ABSTRACT>
A portion of film, with a length proportionate to 
the dimensions and to the characteristics of the product 

to be wrapped, is subjected to a transverse pre-stretching, 
the extent of which is also proportionate to the 

said parameters. The film is held at one end by a fixed 
dispenser (30) and at the other end by a movable rear 

clamp (61), which conveniently reduce the longitudinal 
tension of the film, both in pre-stretching and during 

the subsequent lifting of the product. In this phase, the 
side clamps (78-178) approach each other to reduce the 

pre-stretching, and are then inserted under the product 
and are opened, to extend the side flaps of the film 

under the product. This is followed by the operation, as 
a group, of the rear folder (52), which extends under the 

product a portion of the film held by the associated rear 
clamp (61), and the pusher (55) which pushes the product 

on to the front folder (37), while a final flap of film 
is drawn from the fixed dispenser (30), is extended over 

the whole length of the bottom of the product, is cut to 
size, and is disposed under the side flaps and the rear 

flap, which has been released at the correct time by the 
said rear clamp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and machine 
for wrapping products with stretchable film. There are known processes and machines which carry out 
the said wrapping operation automatically, without 
subjecting the stretchable film to a previous phase of 
pre-stretching. A machine of this type is illustrated, for 
example, in document GB-A-1 297 849. From document US-A-3 967 433 there is known a process and 
machine which subject the stretchable film to pre-stretching 
before forcing the product against it, so as to take maximum 
advantage of the charateristics of stretchability of the 
film used. This machine and process permit the wrapping of 
products having dimensions which vary over a wide range, 
without changing the width of the film used and also permit 
the reduction of the differential tensions in the film in 
contact with the products, ensuring greater strength of the 
film and more declicate treatment of the packaged product. A 
similar machine is disclosed in Italian Patent Application 
No. GE91A000024. Document EP-A-0 092 759 discloses a film wrapping machine 
of this type, in which sensing means are provided for 
sensing the width, length and height of the product to be 
packaged which sensing means select the length of the 
wrapping film drawn from a supply source. According to the mentioned prior art documents, it is 
therefore known a process and machine for wrapping products 
or articles having different dimensions using a stretchable 
film comprising the steps of:  
 
ascertaining length, width and height dimensions of an 
article to be wrapped, feeding a longitudinal segment of the stretchable film 
to a wrapping station, including the step of determining a 
length dimension of the longitudinal segment to be fed to 
the wrapping station which is proportionate to at least the 
length dimension of the article determined in the said 
ascertaining step, pre-stretching at least transversely the said segment 
of film and lifting the article to be wrapped against the 
said pre-stetched portion of film, and folding the film about the article so that the flaps of 
the film are extended under tension onto the bottom of the 
said article. The process and machine according to the present 
invention relate to a process and machine of the type above 
disclosed, which is characterized by the fact that the said 
pre-stretching step comprises the transverse pre-stretching 
of a selected intermediate portion of the longitudinal 
segment of the stretchable film, and includes the steps of:

Machine according to Claim 14, in which there is 
fixed, on the bottom of the intermediate part of the 

carriage (48) carrying the rear folder and the pusher, a 
pair of supports (56) extending backwards and rotatably 

supporting the end of a shaft (57) parallel to the said 
carriage, on which supports there is mounted rotatably 

the intermediate part of a fork (60) whose prongs point 
forwards and carry the upper jaw (161) of the rear clamp 

(61) for taking the film from the dispenser (30), the 
rear part of the said fork being disposed to interact 

with an eccentric (65) keyed to the end of a shaft (62) 
which is supported rotatably by the said supports, 

parallel to the previously mentioned carriage (48), and

where it is supported rotatably and where it carries and 

is fixed to a lever (63) pointing upwards and connected 
to an elastic means (64) by the action of which the said 

eccentric tends normally to be disposed in the position 
of maximum eccentricity and to keep the said upper jaw of 

the clamp raised and bearing on the underside of the rear 
folder (52), provision being made so that, when the 

carriage described above is reaching the end of its 
travel of approach to the front folder, the said lever 

interacts with a fixed cam (75) which causes the rotation 
of the said eccentric into the position of lesser eccentricity 

(165) as a result of which the upper jaw of the 
clamp is lowered and is prepared for interaction with the  

 
film dispenser (30); a lever (58), disposed within the 

said fork (60), being fixed on the end of the shaft which 
forms the pivot of the upper jaw, supporting the lower 

jaw (261) of the clamp in question and tending to rise 
under the action of a leaf spring (69) fixed to the said

the clamp being made to extend to one side of the carriage 

which supports the clamp, where this shaft is 
supported rotatably and carries, fixed to it, a lever 

(58) pointing upwards, which, when the said carriage is 
reaching the end of the travel of approach to the front 

folder, interacts with a cam (71) which initially causes 
the partial lowering of the lower jaw when the upper jaw 

is still raised, with consequent pre-opening of the clamp 
which releases the rear flap of the film, after which, 

when the upper jaw has been lowered, the said cam causes 
the lowering of the lower jaw, necessary to enable the 

clamp to enter in the open state into the dispenser, 
after which the said cam ceases to act and the lower jaw 

is closed elastically on the upper jaw, clamping the film 
disposed in the dispenser, provision being made so that, 

in the subsequent phase of withdrawal of the carriage,

clamp (61) for taking the film from the dispenser, is 
mounted on a support (72) with the possibility of oscillation 

on an axis (73) parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the machine, in opposition to an elastic means (74) so 

that, when the said lever is released by the cam, the 
latter presents behind the said lever a transversely 

inclined face, so that in the subsequent return travel of 
the rear clamp (61), the said lever passes laterally 

across the said cam which is neutralized by swinging 
laterally in opposition to the said elastic means and  

 
which then, when it is released from the lever, returns 

to the active position for the next cycle. 
Machine according to Claim 22, in which the shaft 
(57) which forms the pivot for the clamp (61) for taking 

the film from the dispenser is subjected to the action of

cam, springs (89) being fixed on opposite ends of the 

axle (188) of this roller, and connected at their other 
ends to the said carriage to maintain the interaction 

between the roller and the cam, the whole being made in 
such a way that by giving the cam a particular profile it 

is possible to contain the pressure which the clamps, 
when pushed downwards and opened by the interaction with 

the rear folder (52), exert on this folder. 
Machine according to Claim 26, in which the 
carriage (48) of the rear folder assembly carries under 

it transverse wedge-shaped blocks (53-54), which during  
 

the movement of the said carriage interact with the upper 
jaws of the side clamps (78-178) to lower these clamps 

and to prevent them from interfering with the rear clamp 
(61) mounted on the same carriage. 
Machine according to Claim 26, characterized in 
that the pivot (85) of the lower jaws (84) of each set of 

side clamps (78-178) is formed by a shaft supported

angle and has at one end a grooved roller (93) which runs 
under a rectilinear horizontal bar (96) connected to 

means of raising and lowering, which comprise, for 
example, a hinged parallelogram structure (97), a driving 

servo mechanism of the screw and female thread type 
(98-198), and an electric motor controlled by the computer 

(7) of the machine, so that with these means it is 
possible to open and close the said clamps with a 

flexible cycle dependent on the dimensions of the product 
to be wrapped. 
Machine according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that the lifter (3) which introduces the product into the 

wrapping point is provided with oscillating supports (14)

(8) which can swing on the tubular beam (9) which 

supports them, which are extended beyond this beam and 
each of which carries, hinged to the extension (108), a 

pawl (17) which has its end facing the said beam orientated 
upwards and is compelled by elastic means (18) to 

interact with a cam (20) fixed on the said beam (19) and 
which keeps the said bracket in the normal horizontal 

position; means (25-125-26) being provided which, as a  
 

function of the cycle start position of the rear folder, 
vary the position of a horizontal guided rod (21) which

brackets (8) which, with the corresponding oscillating 
supports, must not interfere with the said folder, any 

brackets (8) which are neutralized being made to interact, 
in the subsequent downward travel of the lifter, 

with fixed stops (22) which return them to the horizontal 
position, with the pawl (17) which returns to interaction 

by a snap movement with the corresponding cam (20). 
Machine according to Claim 14, characterized in 

that it comprises, laterally and below or above the 
product feed path to the lifter (3), banks of 

optoelectronic sensors (5-6) which measure the length, 
width and height of the product to be wrapped from time 

to time, and which send these data to a computer (7) to 
which they are supplied with any manual commands (207), 

and any data relative to the characteristics of the 
products to be wrapped and relative to the characteristics 

of the film used, the whole in such a way that, by 
processing these variables, the computer can control the 

withdrawal and advance of the assembly comprising the 
rear folder, the rear clamp and the pusher (52-61-55), as 

well as the approach to and withdrawal from each other of 
the side clamps (78-178) for transverse pre-stretching 

and folding of the side flaps of the film, with travels 
which from time to time are made proportionate to the 

dimensions and any characteristics of the product to be 
wrapped.
