<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for producing complexes which can be used as floor coverings according to the invention, involving arranging plastic granules successively on a support and, according to a specific pattern, compressing and thermally treating the complex thus produced in order to bring about the production of a homogeneous sheet which is subsequently received, for example, in the form of a winding of great length. They are characterised in that the distribution of each colour of granules according to a specific pattern is carried out through a sieve or screen consisting of a flexible continuous band (3) maintained under tension by means of guide elements (1, 4, 6) located at the rear of the said band and positioned relative to one another in such a way that they have a polygonal cross-section, one of the sides of which is maintained parallel to and spaced from the support (13) to be covered with granules and is displaced at the same speed and in the same direction as the said support.

Process for the production of complexes which
can be used as floor coverings, which consists in

successively depositing, on a coated substrate and in a
defined pattern, granules of plastic, in compressing

the complex thus produced and in heat-treating it so as
to produce a homogeneous sheet which is then taken up,

for example in the form of a long reel, and in which
process:


each colour of granules is distributed on the
substrate in a defined pattern by means of an assembly

comprising a sieve or screen consisting of a continuous
belt (3), which is flexible and deformable and has a

defined pattern for each colour of granule, kept under
tension by means of guiding elements (1,4,6) placed to

the rear of the said belt and positioned one with
respect to another in such a way that it has a cross

section in the form of a polygon, one of the sides of
which is maintained parallel to and spaced away from

the substrate (3) to be covered with granules, and is
moved at the same speed and in the same direction as

the said substrate;
the granules are fed through the belt (3) by
means of a vibrating hopper (2) comprising a chute

having two rigid lips (12) in contact with the surface
of the said belt (3) forming the sieve or screen, the

tension in the belt (3) creating a compressive force
distributed uniformly over the lips/belt contact

generatrix; 
the excess granules (14a) passing between the
lips of the hopper and the unperforated regions of the

belt are recovered by suction.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that the deformable belt (3) has a similar structure to

the screen-printing sheets used for a rotary frame,
this belt being positioned on three holding rollers

(1,4,6), two (4,6) of which define a plane parallel to
and spaced away from the surface to be coated, and the

third (1) of which, lying in the mid-plane of the two
aforementioned rollers (4,6), tensions the said belt by

a vertical displacement.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized
 in that the contact between the rigid
lips (12) of the vibrating hopper (2) and the surface

of the belt (3) forming a sieve or screen lies below
the plane defined by the lower generatrices of the

rollers.
Plant for the production of complexes which can
be used as floor coverings, being in the form of an

assembly comprising essentially means making it
possible to deposit, on a coated substrate, granules of

plastic which are then compressed and heat treated, so
as to produce a homogeneous sheet which is then taken

up in the form of a long reel, the said means making it
possible to deposit the granules consisting of a

succession of assemblies allowing various colours of
granules to be distributed over the substrate in a

defined pattern, each assembly comprising:

a sieve or screen consisting of a continuous
belt (3), which is flexible and deformable and has a

defined pattern for each colour of granules, kept under
tension by means of guiding elements (1,4,6) placed to

the rear of the said belt and positioned one with the
respect to another in such a way that it has a cross

section in the form of a polygon, one of the sides of
which is maintained parallel to and spaced away from

the substrate (13) to be covered with granules, and is 
moved at the same speed and in the same direction as

the said substrate;
the granules are fed through the belt (3) by
means of a vibrating hopper (2) comprising a chute

having two rigid lips (12) in contact with the surface
of the said belt (3) forming the sieve or screen, the

tension in the belt creating a compressive force
distributed uniformly over the lips/belt contact

generatrix;
a suction device (7) making it possible to
recover the excess granules (14a) which pass between

the lips of the hopper and the unperforated regions of
the belt (3).
Plant according to Claim 4, 
characterized
 in
that the deformable belt (3) has a similar structure to

the screen-printing sheets used for a rotary frame,
this belt being positioned on three holding rollers

(1,4,6), two of which (4,6) define a plane parallel to
and spaced away from the surface to be coated, and the

third (1) of which, lying in the mid-plane of the two
aforementioned rollers (4,6), tensions the said belt by

a vertical displacement.
Plant according to Claim 5, 
characterized
 in
that the contact between the rigid lips (12) of the

chute and the surface of the belt (3) forming the sieve
or screen lies below the plane defined by the lower

generatrices of the rollers (4,6).
