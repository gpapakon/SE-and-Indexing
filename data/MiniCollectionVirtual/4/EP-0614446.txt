<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing an alkali metal carbonate, e.g. sodium carbonate, comprises passing a solution or suspension of the alkali metal chloride and bicarbonate over an ion exchange resin which is chloride retaining and has a basicity greater than that of the bicarbonate ion. The product is an aqueous solution or suspension of the alkali metal carbonate. In the case where the alkali metal is sodium, the product may be used for brine purification in a conventional Ammonia Soda process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of alkali metal 
carbonates, particularly but not exclusively, sodium carbonate. Sodium carbonate also known as Soda Ash is obtained by 
'synthetic' routes (i.e. the non-"Natural Ash" routes) and is also 
obtained from naturally occurring deposits of sodium sesquicarbonate. Most of the current synthetic routes for obtaining sodium 
carbonate can be described by the following overall equation: 
2NaCl + CaCO3 → Na2CO3 + CaCl2However the reaction cannot be achieved in a single stage and 
the most commonly used synthetic route (the Ammonia Soda process) 
uses the following series of reactions:- 
2.    CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)23.    2NaCl + 2CO2 + 2NH3 → 2NaHCO3↓ + 2NH4ClThe ammonia, and half the carbon dioxide, are recycled within 
the process, so the overall reaction is as stated above. The sodium chloride for reaction 3 is generally supplied to the 
process as a saturated or near saturated brine obtained by dissolving 
naturally occurring (solid) salt in water. The brine must be purified 
prior to use in the process to remove magnesium and calcium ions 
which would otherwise precipitate in the process as carbonate-containing 
compounds and cause blockage problems. The usual method 
of brine purification is to add sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide 
to the brine so as to form precipitates of calcium carbonate and 
magnesium hydroxide which may then be removed. Obviously the 
sodium carbonate used for this process may be a portion of that  
 
produced in reaction 4. The Ammonia Soda process does however suffer from a number 
of disadvantages. In particular, reactions 4 and 5 require considerable 
energy inputs (in the form of heat) to achieve the reactions desired, 
so the overall process is energy intensive in spite of very 
sophisticated efforts to recover and re-use heat energy within the 
process. The energy requirements of reactions 4 and 5 are a 
particular disadvantage when one considers that a portion of the 
energy is required directly or indirectly to produce that portion of 
the sodium carbonate which is not saleable, i.e. the portion used for 
brine purification. Further disadvantages of the Ammonia Soda 
process are that yield of sodium bicarbonate in reaction 3 does not 
generally exceed 80% and that the separation of this bicarbonate from 
the ammonium chloride also produced in reaction 3 is comparatively 
costly. Attempts to overcome some or all of the abovementioned 
disadvantages have been made. For example, amines have been 
proposed as
