<ABSTRACT>
A crane crab (1), embodied as a monorail crab (1) which can be moved on a girder (4) manually or by means of a motor (20), has a lifting mechanism which can be actuated manually or by means of a motor (20). The lifting mechanism has one side wall (5, 6) each running on both sides of the girder (4) and, rotatably mounted on each side wall (5, 6), a rope pulley or a chain sprocket (11) - depending on whether a rope, in particular a steel rope, or a chain is used as flexible strand for lifting and lowering the load. A rope or a load chain (13) is run over the rope pulley or chain sprocket (11) to a liftable and lowerable carrying means. The crab (1) also has at least one running wheel (2, 2') on each side, which is movable on the girder (4) and is rotatably mounted on the side wall (5, 6). This crane crab (1) has a rope pulley or chain sprocket (11) which is mounted with the running wheel (2, 2') in each case together on one spindle (8, 9), the rope pulley or chain sprocket (11) being arranged between the side wall (5, 6) and the running wheel (2, 2').

Travelling trolley in a construction as a monorail trolley
(1) displaceable manually or by means of a motor on

a supporting beam (4) and having a lifting mechanism
which is operable manually or by means of a motor (20),

with in each case a side wall (5, 6) on either side of
the beam (4) and a sprocket or a cable pulley (11) mounted

in rotary manner thereon, as a function of whether as
the flexible strand for raising and lowering the load use

is made of a cable, particularly a steel cable, or a
chain, by means of which a cable or a chain (13) is guided

to a raisable and lowerable load carrying means (16,
17) and with at least one running wheel (2, 2') movable

on the supporting beam (4) and mounted in rotary manner
on the particular side wall (5, 6), wherein on either

side of the trolley (1) the cable pulley or sprocket (11)
and the running wheel (2, 2') are in each case mounted on

a common axle (8), the cable pulley or sprocket (11)
being positioned between the side wall (5, 6) and the

wheel (2, 2').
Travelling trolley according to claim 1, wherein the
cable or chain (13) emanating from a drive unit (14) is

guided on each side by means of at least one guide pulley
(15) to the cable pulley or sprocket (11), the guide

pulley (15) and the cable pulley or sprocket (11) being
arranged in the same vertical plane.
Travelling trolley according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
two side walls (5, 6) are firmly joined together by

crossbolts (22, 23) passing below the supporting beam (4)
and have recesses (26, 27) for the load carrying means

and for the drive unit (14). 
Travelling trolley according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein the common axle (8) for the running wheel (2, 2')

and the cable pulley or sprocket (11) on each side is
only fixed to the side wall (5, 6), so that the wheel (2,

2') and the cable pulley or sprocket (11) are jointly
mounted in overhanging manner.
Travelling trolley according to one or more of the claims
1 to 4, wherein the cable pulley or sprocket (11) is

placed directly alongside and very close to the wheel (2,
2') on the axle (8).
Travelling trolley according to one or more of the claims
1 to 5, wherein the load carrying means is a girder (17)

provided with a load hook (16) and against which strike
the cable or chain strands (13a, 13b) guided by means of

the sprockets or cable pulleys (11).
Travelling trolley according to one or more of the claims
1 to 5, wherein the load carrying means is a girder (17)

provided with a load hook (16) and each cable or each
chain (13) is guided by means of in each case one bearing

pulley (30) mounted on either side of the girder (17) and
the chain or cable end is in each case fixed to a rocking

arm (25) mounted level with the wheels (2, 2') on the
side wall (5, 6).
Travelling trolley according to claim 7, wherein the
rocking arm (25) is mounted on the axle (9) of the adjacent

wheel (2).
