seismic data that can be presented as images. Due to the techniques used 
for collecting seismic data, an image produced to represent that data 

will typically be expected to exhibit an inherent symmetry about an axis. 
The apparatus of the present invention comprises a sto

storing a frame of seismic data which can be presented as an image, a 

selection device for selecting an axis within the image as the axis of 
symmetry, and a divider for dividing the data about the axis of symmetry 

to create first and second sets of data. Further it includes a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the detection of errors in seismic
data and in particular to apparatus for detecting errors in frames of
seismic data that can be presented as images. Due to the techniques used
for collecting seismic data, an image produced to represent that data
will typically be expected to exhibit an inherent symmetry about an axis.However seismic survey data is subject to various errors from many
causes; the most frequent cause of errors are background noise and misplaced
equipment. Analysis of the seismic data is typically a very long
process with the data passing through many stages of computational
processing. Hence it is desirable to identify errors in frames of data
as early as possible to avoid wasting valuable time processing bad data.
A reliable technique for detecting errors could save much re-work.Typically a company involved in obtaining and analysing seismic
data will have to transport a great deal of hardware to the survey
location, will carry out a large number of seismic tests, and then will
return to the laboratory to analyse the data. Seismic tests usually
involve positioning cables in lines on the surface of the land (or towing
cables behind a ship on the surface of water), each cable having a number
of sensors attached to it along its length. A shock wave is then
generated, eg. by firing a shot, at a location on the surface
symmetrically disposed with respect to the cables, and the shock waves
are detected along these cables of sensors. Given this type of
arrangement, it is apparent that viewing the collections of signals as an
image and checking for symmetry is a good way of detecting errors. However, up until now, this has been done by geophysicists checking
by eye
who have carried out complex subjective assessments such as
looking for anomalous data, but who did not measure a symmetry
as such.
Obviously this is very time consuming, labour intensive, and
prone to errors, and so it would be highly desirable to reduce the time
that a geophysicist must spend inspecting the data. The seismic industry
has applied theories of geophysics in an attempt to solve the problem of
error detection, but has been unable to solve the problem purely within
the domain of geophysics.It is hence an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved technique for detecting errors in frames of seismic data, which
requires much less human activity.Ideally it would be useful if the detection of errors could be
carried out at the survey site so that, if necessary, data can be

Apparatus for detecting errors in frames of seismic data that can
be presented as images, such images being expected to exhibit an inherent

symmetry about an axis, the apparatus comprising:

a storage device (220) for storing a frame of seismic data which can be
presented as an image;
a selection device (240) for selecting an axis within the image as the axis of
symmetry;
a divider (260) for dividing the data about the axis of symmetry to create
first and second sets of data; and
a comparison means (160, 270, 250) for comparing the sets of data according to
preselected matching criteria to determine, based on the degree of

matching, whether the extent of mismatch in the frame of data is within a
predetermined tolerance.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the comparison means
comprises:


a matching device (160) for comparing the sets of data to determine the degree
of matching between such sets; and
decision logic (270), responsive to output from the matching device, to
determine whether the extent of mismatch is within the predetermined

tolerance.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the comparison means
further comprises:


an edge detector (250) for determining the data points representing
discontinuities in the image, and to create an edge list of such data

points, such edge lists being used as the basis of comparison by the
matching device.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the divider operates on
the whole frame of seismic data prior to passing the first and second

sets of data separately through the edge detector, the edge lists created
by the edge detector being received by the matching device for

comparison.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the edge detector operates
on the whole frame of seismic data and then the edge list is operated on

by the divider so as to create two edge lists as the first and second
sets of data for comparison by the matching device.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the divider
includes a mirroring means for re-ordering the data in the first set of

data so that it can be represented by an image which would be the mirror
image of the image previously representing that set, the comparison means

then comparing the second set of data with the re-ordered first set of
data.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 and claim 6, wherein the mirroring
means re-orders the first set of data created by the divider by employing

a buffer in which to store data from that set of data constituting a row
of an image, the contents in the buffer then being read out in reverse

order and stored as the re-ordered first set of data.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the selection
device is an amplitude peak detector which selects the axis of symmetry

as the position in the data having the highest detected intensity.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the selection
device uses information contained in the seismic data, giving the

positioning of the shot for that frame of data, to select an axis as the
axis of symmetry.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 3 to 9, wherein the edge
detector employs a canny edge detection algorithm in order to identify

the data points representing edges.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the matching 
device uses a stereo matching algorithm.
