<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes and apparatus 
for forming needles. More particularly, this invention 
relates to processes and apparatus for forming needle 
blanks useful in forming surgical needles, the needle 
blanks having one end of the blank drilled for attachment 
of a suture to the needle. The production of needles involves many 
processing steps and different types of machinery to 
perform each step. The accuracy and repeatability of the 
various processes become more critical in the preparation 
of high quality surgical needles from raw stock. Some of 
the processes involved in the production of surgical grade 
needles include straightening spooled wire stock, cutting a 
length of stock wire to form a needle blank, tapering or 
grinding points on one end of the blank, providing a bore 
for receiving suture thread at the other end of the blank, 
flat pressing a portion of the needle barrel to facilitate 
easier grasping by surgical instrumentation, and curving 
the needle where curved needles are desired. Normally, each processing step is performed by a 
different piece of machinery. This requires that the 
needle blanks be manually transferred from one piece of 
machinery to another as sequential processing steps are 
carried out. The transfer step increases the time and 
manpower necessary for needle production. Generally, there are numerous ways to drill or 
cut the hole in the end face of a needle blank. For 
example, the hole may be made by drill machining, electric  
 
discharge machining, laser beam machining, electron beam 
machining and the like. With the advent of microsurgical 
procedures, surgical sutures have become increasingly 
smaller in size, thus requiring increased precision in 
needle production techniques and making it more complex and 
costly to manufacture the surgical needles. In particular, 
one aspect of surgical suture manufacturing which has 
become more difficult and complex for small diameter 
needles is drilling the hole in the needle blank. The 
small diameter needle blanks must be presented to the bore-forming 
device with extreme precision to ensure centrality 
of the bore formed therein. In addition, as the diameter 
of the wire decreases, as a general rule so does the length 
of the needle. Precise handling of short, very fine needle 
blanks without causing damage to the needle blank is quite 
difficult to achieve. A common procedure for making a hole in a 
surgical needle utilizes laser or electron beam machining. 
In order to utilize these methods in a

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a drilled needle blank for a surgical 
suture-needle combination, the method comprising the 

steps of: 

advancing continuous stock wire (15) into a drilling 
station (60); 
forming a suture attachment portion within the 
leading end face of said stock wire; and 
thereafter cutting said stock wire behind said 
leading end face to a predetermined length to form said 

needle blank. 
A method according to claim 1, including the step of 
applying electromagnetic energy to said end face of said 

stock wire to form said suture attachment portion. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein said 
electromagnetic energy is laser energy, delivered in a 

beam which is on the longitudinal axis of said stock 
wire. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, further comprising 
the step (30) of straightening the stock wire prior to 

said forming step.

an insert (67) with a bore having an upstream end, 
and downstream end at the drilling station; 
drilling means (50) for forming a suture attachment 
portion within the leading end face of the stock wire 

(15) as it emerges from the downstream end of the insert 
bore; and 
means (64, 66, 88) for cutting the drilled stock 
wire (15) at a point which is a predetermined length 

behind the leading end face of the stock wire, after said 
face has been drilled, to form a drilled needle blank.
