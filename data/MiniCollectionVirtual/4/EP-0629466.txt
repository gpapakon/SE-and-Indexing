<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to lead free, low toxicity 
solder alloys that are particularly useful in microelectronic 
applications. The solder alloys of the invention, which 
contain in excess of 90 weight percent Sn, and an effective 
amount of either (1) Ag and Bi, optionally with Sb or with Sb 
and Cu, or (2) Ag and Sb, optionally with Bi. These alloys are 
particularly useful in joining integrated circuit chips to 
chip carriers and substrates, as printed circuit boards, 
joining chip carriers to substrates, and joining 
circuitization lands and pads in multilayer printed circuit 
boards. Soldering is a low temperature, generally reversible, 
metallurgical joining process. Low temperature and 
reversibility are especially important in electronics 
applications because of the materials involved and the 
necessity for reworking and making engineering changes. Solder joining is a wetting process followed by a chemical 
reaction. Molten solder wets selectively. The selective 
wettability of solders allow molten solder to be confined to 
desired sites. This is especially important in flip chip 
bonding, and in working with solder masks. The soldering process can be accomplished as quickly as the 
wetting takes place, for example, on the order of a few 
seconds. This makes soldering particularly desirable for 
automated, high speed, high throughput processes.  Wettability is also a function of the materials to be joined, 
with Cu, Ni, Au, and Pd, as well as alloys rich in one or more 
of these metals, being particularly amenable to soldering. The chemical reaction following wetting is between the molten 
solder and the joining metallurgy to form an intermetallic 
phase region at the interface. The intermetallic phases 
formed by solders in electronic packaging are stoichiometric 
compounds, typically binary compounds, and typically 
containing Sn if Sn is present in the solder alloy. When the 
base, pad, or land is Cu, and the solder alloy is rich is Sn, 
the intermetallic formed during soldering is Cu-Sn. Exemplary 
Cu-Sn binaries include Cu₃Sn and Cu₆Sn₅. Solder alloys are characterized by the melting temperature 
being a strong function of composition. While a pure metal is 
characterized by a single, invariant, melting temperature, the 
freezing and melting points of alloys are complex. The 
freezing point of an alloy is determined by the liquidus line. 
Above the liquidus line only a liquid phase or phases can 
exist. The melting point of an alloy is determined by the 
solidus line. Below the
