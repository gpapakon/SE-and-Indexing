<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for feeding alloy additive 
and burden materials to the burden in a vertical shaft 

furnace working volume generally by gravity feeding the 
alloy additive to the furnace tuyere (22) for 

entrainment in the blast media and transfer to the 

burden, which improves the recovery rate of the charged 
additive components in the molten metal and allows 

utilization of undersized materials without secondary 
handling and treatment of the feed materials or 

utilization of pneumatic feed apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gravity-feeding
mechanism for a vertical-shaft furnace and a method of
transferring burden and/or alloy additive material for
entrainment of the materials and communication to a
vertical-shaft furnace.The apparatus utilizes a gravity feed method to
obviate powered entrainment and transmission means, such
as pneumatic injection apparatus. The apparatus
provides for the direct charging and utilization of
various materials in vertical-shaft furnaces, such as
blast furnaces and cupolas, which various materials are
not usually utilized for direct introduction with the
top-charged burden materials.In both of the above-noted furnace types, the raw
or burden materials are generally charged through the
top of the furnace. In a blast furnace, the iron ore or
iron-bearing charge material may consist of any of the
forms or oxidation states of iron, which are reduced in
a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures.
Although it is known that blast furnaces have been run
without a pressurised top, modern furnace practices
utilize pressurized furnaces with feed hoppers having a
dual-bell system to maintain the internal furnace
pressure during charge additions. A non-pressurised
blast furnace is disclosed in GB-0180395.The chemical and thermodynamic reactions in
the vertical-shaft furnace require a combination
of materials in the burden 
including coke, iron-bearing materials and limestone. The coke
is a multifaceted addition to this burden. It reacts with the
oxygen in the blast air blown into the furnace to burn and
provide the reaction heat, which blast air may be enriched with
oxygen or other gasses. Coke combustion products include carbon
monoxide, which acts to reduce the iron oxides to elemental iron
particularly in the upper regions of the furnace. The hot
gasses evolved during carbon combustion at the tuyere region
preheat the burden materials at the upper reaches of the furnace,
gasses at least partially dry and prereduce the other raw
materials. The coke charge also has a mechanical function in the
furnace reaction, as it must be able to sustain the overlying
burden weight without being crushed, which preserves a path for
ready flow of the gasses through the burden above the hearth.The ores and other iron-bearing charge materials are not
pure iron oxide but rather are frequently mineral bearing
materials laden with extraneous or gangue components. Therefore,
lime usually in the form of limestone is added to the burden to
flux the molten iron and to generate a slag. This
