<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a printed circuit card latching and stiffening 
assembly with an elongated stiffener member located on the top edge 

of the printed circuit card. A latch is pivotally attached to the 
stiffener member. At least one compliant clip is mounted on the 

stiffener member so that the clip may be slid to engage the pivotal 
latch in a locked position. The latch also includes a slot for 

engaging an electronic enclosure structure, such as a card cage. 
The slot enables the card to be cammed into the base of the card 

cage when the pivotal latch engages the sliding compliant clip. The 
latching and stiffening assembly further includes at least one 

pivotal member which may pivot from the stiffener member to engage 
a side of the printed circuit card further stiffening the card.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to supporting and strengthening printed 
circuit cards, and is especially useful for those printed circuit 
cards which are contained in electronic enclosure structures such 
as card cages. Further, the invention is particularly useful for 
circuit cards having low wipe connectors. Printed circuit cards are subject to warpage and linear 
distortion due to the weight of electronic components and stress 
applied during the soldering process. A result of the distortion 
and warpage may be a physically weakened substrate. It is a 
problem to maintain the integrity of the solder joints during 
card insertion and extraction of such weakened substrates. Another problem arises when using printed circuit cards which 
employ the so called "low wipe" connectors. Wipe refers to the 
action that occurs when a circuit card is inserted in an 
electronic structure. The "wiping" action occurs when the 
contact of the circuit card with the connector contact element 
wipes away any oxide or other contaminant on the circuit card 
contact terminal so as to reliably engage the base metal. Low 
wipe means that the amount of surface area available for the 
contacting elements is significantly smaller than a normal wipe 
environment. Low wipe environments are the product of 
increasingly compact designs required by the need to more densely 
pack electronic machinery. An inherent problem within low wipe environments is that very 
tight tolerances must be obtained in order to effectuate electrical  
 
contact. Significantly, the amount of contact length that 
may be available on a low wipe connector may be in the 
neighborhood of 1 millimeter (.040 of an inch) . When all the 
worst case dimensional tolerances are added together for each 
component required in the electronic packaging of the circuit 
card it can be seen that obtaining the proper dimensional 
relationship would require extremely strict control of the 
dimensions of each component. Maintaining tight tolerances requires quality testing of 
components during manufacturing and frequent rejection of 
parts. Such testing and subsequent rejection requires time 
and added cost due to time and the scrapped parts. The limited contact in low wipe connectors presents another 
problem. Due to the small amount of contact area available in 
low wipe connectors, a skewed angle of approach of a low wipe 
connector to a mating connector could result in lack of 
electrical contact. The size and shape of a strengthening and stiffening device 
must be such that
