<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a metal covering or cladding interior wall (1) for a building possessing a frame, the said interior wall (1) being formed by juxtaposed ribbed sectional profiles (10) having a generally U-shaped cross-section, each comprising a web (11) provided on two of its parallel longitudinal edges (11a, 11b) with a flange (12a, 12b) bordered by a bent-over edge (13a, 13b) and forming, with the flange (12a, 12b) and the edge (13a, 13b) of the adjacent profile (10), an interlocking assembly. The interior wall (1) possesses, in the region of at least one interlocking assembly, at least one reinforcement profile (20) formed, on the one hand, by two parallel flange parts (21, 22), a first flange part (21) being applied against the web (11) of one of the sectional profiles (10) and a second flange part (22) being applied against the edge (13a) of the said sectional profile (10) and, on the other hand, by a web (23) joining the said flange parts (22).

Interior metal facing or covering wall for a 
building having a timber frame, said interior wall (1) 

being formed by generally U-shaped, juxtaposed, ribbed 
sections (10) each having a web (11) provided, on two of 

its parallel longitudinal edges (11a, 11b), with a 
flange (12a, 12b) flanked by a folded-back border (13a, 

13b) forming an assembly by interlocking with the flange 
(12a, 12b) and border (13a, 13b) of the adjacent section 

(10), said sections (10) being secured to the elements 
(4) of the frame by fixing means (5), characterised in 

that it comprises, level with at least one interlocking 
assembly, at least one reinforcing section (20) formed 

on the one hand by two parallel shoes (21, 22), a first 
shoe (21) being applied to the web (11) of one of the 

ribbed sections (10) and a second shoe (22) being 
applied to the folded-back border (13a) of said section 

(10), and on the other hand by a web (23) linking said 
shoes (21, 22). 
Wall according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the first shoe (21) of the reinforcing section (20) is 

fixed to the web (11) of the corresponding ribbed 
section (10) by means (5) for fixing said section (10) 

to the elements (4) of the frame. 
Wall according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a reinforcing section (20) level with each 

interlocking assembly. 
Wall according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a reinforcing section (20) level with each 

element (4) of the frame. 
Wall according to claim 1, characterised in that  
 

the width of the first shoe (21) of the reinforcing 
section (20) is greater than the width of the second 

shoe (22) of said reinforcing section. 
Wall according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the length of the reinforcing section (20) is greater 

than the width of the element (4) of the frame to which 
it is fixed. 
Wall according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the longitudinal free edge of each 

shoe (21, 22) of the reinforcing section (20) comprises 
a folded-back border. 
Wall according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the reinforcing section (20) is 

generally C-shaped in cross section. 
Wall according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the reinforcing section (20) is 

generally Z-shaped in cross section.
