<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile radio terminal with a speech processing device for processing speech signals (x(i)) comprising noise and speech signal components. An estimating device (7) for continuous formation of estimated values (SNR(i)) of the signal-to-noise power ratio of the speech signals (x(i)) is provided through means for     - determining the power values of speech signal sample values,   - smoothing the power values, - determining in each case the minimum of a group of L consecutive smoothed power values (Px,s(i)), the groups following on continuously from one another and containing at least enough smoothed power values (Px,s(i)) to ensure that in each case all smoothed power values (Px,s(i)) associated with any given phoneme of the speech signal (x(i)) can be captured by a single group, - forming a current estimated value (SNR(i)) of the signal-to-noise power ratio from the current smoothed power value and the last determined minimum.

A mobile radio terminal (50) which comprises a speech processing device
(20, ..., 27, 51) for processing speech signals (x(i)) formed by noise components and

speech components, said radio terminal including an estimation device (7) for
continuously forming estimates (SNR(i)) of the signal-to-noise ratio of the speech signals

(x(i)) by means for determining the power values (P
x
(i)) from sample values of the
speech signals (x(i)) and for smoothing the power values (P
x
(i)), characterized

in that no speech pause detection means is provided,
in that means (7) are provided for determining each time the minimum
of a group of L successive smoothed power values (P
x,2
(i)), the groups
uninterruptedly succeeding each other and containing at least enough

smoothed power values (P
x,2
(i)), so that all the smoothed power values
(P
x,2
(i)) of a single group associated with a random phoneme of the
speech signal can be combined, and
in that means (7) are provided for continuously forming, independently of
speech pauses, a present estimate (SNR(i)) of the signal-to-noise ratio from the

present smoothed power value (P
x,2
(i)) and the most recently determined
minimum power value.
A mobile radio terminal as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that means
are provided for forming adjacent sub-groups of 
M = L/W
 successive smoothed power
values each, where W is a natural integer and W sub-groups form one group, and for

determining the minimum of the minima of W successive sub-groups to determine the
minimum of the associated group.
A mobile radio terminal as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that means
are provided for utilizing the most recently determined minimum of a sub-group instead

of the most recently determined minimum of a group when there is a predeterminable
number of monotonously rising minima of sub-groups, to estimate the present value

(SNR(i)) of the signal-to-noise ratio.
A mobile radio terminal as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that means are provided for utilizing the present smoothed power value

instead of a group or sub-group minimum that has been determined most recently, to
estimate a present value of the signal-to-noise ratio for the case where the present

smoothed power value is smaller than the minimum that has been determined most
recently.
A mobile radio terminal as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that speech processing means are provided for processing the disturbed

speech signals (x(i)) in dependence on estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio.
A speech processing device (20, ..., 27, 51) for processing speech signals
(x(i)) formed by noise components and speech components, said radio terminal including

an estimation device (7) for continuously forming estimates (SNR(i)) of the signal-to-noise
ratio of the speech signals (x(i)) by means for determining the power values (P
x
(i))
from sample values of the speech signals (x(i)) and for smoothing the power values

(P
x
(i)) characterized

in that no speech pause detection means is provided,
in that means (7) are provided for determining each time the minimum
of a group of L successive smoothed power values (P
x,2
(i)), the groups
uninterruptedly succeeding each other and containing at least enough

smoothed power values (P
x,2
(i)), so that all the smoothed power values
(P
x,2
(i)) of a single group associated with a random phoneme of the
speech signal can be combined, and
in that means (7) are provided for continuously forming, independently of
speech pauses, a present estimate (SNR(i)) of the signal-to-noise ratio from the

present smoothed power value (P
x,2
(i)) and the most recently determined
minimum power value.
