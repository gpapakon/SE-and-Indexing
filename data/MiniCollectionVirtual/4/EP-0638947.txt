<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thin film solid state electrochemical cells. More 
particularly, this invention relates to novel positive electrodes consisting of composites of 
an organo-sulfur compound, a p-doped conjugated polymer and a polymer electrolyte. Considerable interest has been shown over the last few years in thin film secondary 
lithium batteries based on polymer electrolytes and insertion material cathodes. The intense 
research effort is driven by new requirements for high performance batteries in portable 
communication equipment, consumer electronics. portable computers and electric vehicles. 
Thin film solid state cells using cathodes based on organo-sulfur compounds are 
particularly well suited because of their high energy to weight ratio. Two main types of cathode materials used in the manufacture of thin film lithium 
and sodium batteries are known in the art. The first material includes transition metal 
chalcogenides, such as titanium disulfide with alkali metals as the anode. For example, 
among the cathode active chalcogenides, U.S. Patent No. 4,049,879 lists transition metal 
phosphorous chalcogenides. Other U.S. Patents, such as 4,143,214, 4,152,491 and 
4,664,991 describe cells wherein the cathode is a carbon/sulfur based material, generally of 
the CxS formula where x is typically 10 or larger. U.S. Patent No. 4,142,294 to Chang, et al. describes cells having cathodes 
containing CxS, wherein x is a numerical value from about 4 to about 50. U.S. Patent No. 
4,152,491 to Chang, et al. relates to electric current producing cells where the cathode-active 
materials include one or more polymer compounds having a plurality of carbon 
monosulfide units. The carbon monosulfide unit is generally described as (CS)x wherein x 
is an integer of at least 5, and may be at least 50, and is preferably at least 100. In both cells 
developed by Chang et al., the energy storage capacity 
is limited because there is a low  
 
density of sulfur-sulfur bonds. U.S. Patent No. 4,664,991 to Perichaud, et al. describes a substance containing a 
one-dimensional electric conducting polymer and at least one polysulfurated chain forming 
a complex with the polymer. Perichaud, et al. use a material which has two components. 
One is the conducting polymer, which is selected from a group consisting of 
polyacetylenes, polyparaphenylenes, polythiophenes, polypyrroles, polyanilines and their 
substituted derivatives. The other is a polysulfurated chain which is in a charge transfer 
relation to the conducting
