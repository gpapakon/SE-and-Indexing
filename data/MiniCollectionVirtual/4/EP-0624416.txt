<ABSTRACT>
A sequential electrochemical reduction method and apparatus are provided for assessing 
and restoring solderability of electronic component leads. The method detects and quantifies the 

presence of metallic oxides that are detrimental to solderability by sequential electrochemical 
reduction in contact with an electrolyte in an inert atmosphere. A cathode having a high 

hydrogen overvoltage is placed in contact with the electrolyte. A solderable portion of the 
component to be tested is placed in contact with the cathode and the electrolyte. An inert 

counter electrode and a reference electrode are also placed in contact with the electrolyte. A 
current is passed between the cathode and inert electrode, and the voltage and current are 

measured as a function of time during reduction of metallic oxides on the solderable portions of 
the component. The measurements of voltage, current, time, and charge density may be 

compared with baseline data from specimens having known oxide compositions that correlate 
with degradation of solderability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 
706,142 filed May 28, 1991. The present invention relates to chronopotentiometric methods of analysis and, in 
particular, to a sequential electrochemical reduction method and apparatus for assessing and 
restoring the solderability of electronic component leads and printed wiring boards. A major cost problem experienced by the electronics industry is the loss of solderability 
of electronic components and printed circuit boards, particularly during storage. Poor 
solderability of component leads and printed wiring boards is believed to account for as much 
as 75% of solder joint failures. Because humid environments are known to exacerbate the 
problem, an electrochemical mechanism is clearly the cause of solderability degradation. In the 
lead-tin-copper solder system, for example, previous studies have determined that oxidation of 
the tin-lead (Sn-Pb) surface and underlying copper-tin (Cu-Sn) intermetallic layers is 
involved in the degradation process. In the past, however, the nature of the various oxides and 
their roles in the degradation of solderability remained obscure. Traditional techniques typically employed in the prior art for surface analysis of circuit 
boards provide only subjective indicators of solderability. Presently used production test 
methods are also destructive by nature. Because degradation of solderability is known to 
involve an electrochemical mechanism, it is believed that solderability can be assessed more 
accurately and efficiently using electrochemical methods and apparatus that provide in situ 
quantitative analysis of metallic oxides known to degrade solderability. In particular, there is a  
 
need for quantitative, nondestructive, electrochemical methods of analyzing and/or restoring 
solderability that are easily applied for testing off-the-shelf components, such as printed wiring 
boards and dual-in-line package (DIP) components, for example, for process control in the 
production environment, and for restoring solderability of degraded components. The present invention comprises a method of sequential electrochemical reduction 
analysis ("SERA"), including apparatus for assessing and/or restoring (i.e., improving) 
solderability of electronic component leads and printed wiring boards. The SERA method 
detects and quantifies metallic oxides known to degrade solderability when present on metal 
surfaces that are to be soldered. The method of the present invention is
