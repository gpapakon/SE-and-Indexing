<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (2) for producing a silicon single 
crystal (28) grown by the Czochralski method includes a main 

chamber (6) having a round soulder (6b) interconnecting the 
upper end of a side wall (6a) and the lower end of a neck (4) 

of the main chamber (6). The round shoulder (6b) has an 
inside surface (6c) so profiled as to form a portion of the 

periphery of an ellipse (E) drawn about two foci (F1, F2) 
which are composed of the upper end of a heater (16) and a 

point of the longitudinal axis of a silicon single 
crystal (28) being grown. The inside surface (6c) has a low 

emissivity. With the apparatus (2) thus constructed, a 
silicon single crystal (28) having a high dielectric breakdown 

strength of oxide film (SiO₂) can be produced in a 
stable manner with high yield and productivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
producing a silicon single crystal grown by the Czochralski
method also known as pulling method.Conventionally, in the production of a silicon
single crystal grown by the Czochralski method (hereinafter
referred to as "CZ" method), a silicon single crystal producing
apparatus such as shown here in FIG. 2 of the accompanying
drawings is used. The apparatus includes a main
chamber 6 composed of a side wall 6a and an upper wall 7
having at its central portion a neck 4. Hot melt parts,
which are used to heat the raw material to melt the same and
keep the raw material in the molten or liquid state, are
disposed at the central portion of the main chamber 6. The
hot melt parts are composed of a quartz crucible 12 protected
by a graphite crucible 11, and a heater 16 and a thermal
shield or insulator 18 that are disposed around the crucibles
11, 12. The apparatus further includes a gate valve 8
disposed above the neck 4 of the main chamber 6, a pull
chamber (not shown) and a crystal lift device including a
lift mechanism (neither shown) that are disposed above the
gate valve 8. An exhaust port 19 is connected with a vacuum
pump (not shown) for controlling the pressure of an inert
gas within the main chamber 6 and discharging the inert gas 
from the main chamber 6.In operation, in an inert gas atmosphere held under
reduced pressure, a seed crystal 26 fixed to the front end
of a pull shaft 24, such as a wire, is dipped into a silicon
melt 14 in the quartz crucible 12 while the quartz crucible
12 is rotating about its own axis. The seed crystal 26
while being rotated is then pulled up from the silicon melt
14 so that a silicon single crystal 28 is produced.The single crystal produced by the CZ method is
used to fabricate silicon wafers (hereinafter referred to as
"CZ wafers"). It has been known that the CZ wafers have a
dielectric breakdown strength of oxide film (SiO2) which is
considerably lower than that of those wafers fabricated from
a single crystal produced by the floating zone method (FZ
method), or that of epitaxial wafers each composed of a thin
silicon film epitaxially grown on a CZ wafer. However, due
to various advantageous features, the CZ wafers are widely
used as a material for fabricating semiconductor devices.More particularly, in recent years, with the advance
of high integration of semiconductor circuits and
accompanying microminiaturization of devices, the thickness
of a dielectric oxide film at the gate electrode of a MOS-LSI
chip has been
