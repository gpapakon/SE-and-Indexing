<ABSTRACT>
The method for the continuous production of chewing gum having various colours and flavours from a single neutral chewing-gum mass is characterised in that a neutral basic gum is prepared in a single preparation and cooking unit (11) which is common to several shaping lines (15), in that this gum is fed in the liquid state to as many extruders (14) as there are variously coloured and flavoured products produced from the same single neutral gum mass, in that the colouring and flavouring specific to each product are injected into each extruder (14), in that at the outlet of each extruder (14) the products are introduced into an additional cooling unit (23) before being picked up by a wrapping machine (27, 28), of which there is one for each line (15), which wraps them individually and then passes them on to a common wrapping and packaging machine (30). This invention concerns manufacturers of production lines for the food industry and more specifically for confectionary products.

Method of continuously producing chewing-gums having
different colours and flavours from the same neutral chewing-gum,

characterised in that a neutral base gum is prepared in a
single preparation-cooking unit (11) for a plurality of

shaping lines (15), the gum is fed in the liquid state to as
many extruders (14), having injection of colouring and

flavouring, as there are products having different colours and
flavours produced from the same neutral gum, the products are

fed at the outlet of each extruder (14) to a subsequent
cooling unit (23) before being taken up by an individual

wrapping device (27, 28) for each line (15), which is followed
by a common wrapping-bagging device (30).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
extruders (14) are extruders-mixers-coolers.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the
extruders (14) have a separate cooling unit.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that each shaping line (15) has its own

cooling duct (8).
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the shaping lines (15) end in a multiway

tunnel (42) that supplies the individual wrapping devices
(27, 28).
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the extruders-mixers are preceded by a

common pre-cooling and pre-shaping unit (33) that treats the
neutral gum. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that the
common pre-cooling and pre-shaping unit (33) that treats the

neutral gum forms a primary extruded mass.
