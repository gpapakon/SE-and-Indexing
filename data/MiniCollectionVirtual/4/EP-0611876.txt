<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for an oil separator, particularly for the gases in the crankcase ventilation of an internal combustion engine. This oil separator has a filter element 14 through which the vented gases flow and from which the separated oil is returned to the oil tank 4 via an oil return 23. The de-oiled vented gases are fed to the air intake system of the internal combustion engine. According to the invention, a vacuum generator 11 is provided and this produces a particular constant vacuum for the extraction of the vented gases. An air de-oiling element 14 is furthermore provided for oil separation, this element having microfibres which are, in particular, produced from glass fibre material.

<CLAIMS>
Oil separator for the blow-through gases of the 
crankcase venting system of an internal combustion 

engine, including a filter element, which is traversed 
by the blow-through gases and from which the separated 

oil is returned to the oil reservoir (4) via an oil 
return pipe (23), and whereby the oil-free blow-through 

gases are supplied to the air-intake system (1, 2) of 
the internal combustion engine, characterised in that a 

reduced pressure generator (11) is provided in order to 
form a reduced pressure for the evacuation of the 

blow-through gases, the reduced pressure generator being 
an ejector nozzle which is impinged with compressed air, 

the compressed air being taken from the compressed-air 
supply means (5, 7, 8) of a vehicle, and the quantity of 

the compressed air to be supplied being controllable via 
an adjustable throttle (10). 
Oil separator according to claim 1, 
characterised in that a means (14) for removing oil from 

air is provided as the filter element for the separation 
of oil and has microfibres which are especially produced 

from glassfibre material, these microfibres being shaped 
to form a wound element or an element which has been 

folded in a star-shaped manner. 
Oil separator according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the means (14) for removing oil 

from air is provided with at least one perforated sheet 
metal casing for support purposes. 
Oil separator according to one of claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the means (14) for removing oil  

 
from air is disposed in a compact and exchangeable 

container. 
Oil separator according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a non-return valve (15) is 

disposed in the pipe for the discharge of the oil-free 
gases.
