<ABSTRACT>
Magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers (16) are optimized. Dimensional relationships involved in the flow of magnetic flux are related to an operational parametric ratio of magnetic flux density in the fluid to the flux density in the steel. A magnetic valve (30) is utilized to change the flow parameters of the MR fluid and, hence, the operational characteristics of the damper (16). Several embodiments depicting improved piston designs, including spool as well as toroidal configurations, are disclosed. In addition, both single (16) and twin-tube (16) housing designs are presented, along with several sealless designs. Baffle plates (50) and toroidal magnetic segments (40) interspersed with flow slots (56) are utilized to increase contact between the fluid and the magnetic coil (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
Incompressible fluids have been used in shock absorbers and other
dampers, as well as in elastomeric mounts, for decades. The use of
controllable fluids, electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR)
fluids in dampers, was first proposed in the early 1950's by Winslow in U.S.
Patent No. 2,661,596. The use of a controllable fluid in a damper affords
some intriguing possibilities relative to providing widely varying damping
for varying conditions encountered by the damper. Nonetheless, the use of
controllable fluids was generally restricted to the area of clutches, with a
few exceptions, until the mid-1980's.Interest in the use of controllable fluids revived in the 1980's as
activity in the area of controllable dampers increased. Most of the
resurgent activity has occurred relative to ER dampers and associated
fluids. While interest and development of ER fluid devices continues,
performance of such systems have been disappointing from three
standpoints:
1) the damping forces that can be generated by an ER fluid device
are limited due to the relatively low yield strengths of the available
fluids;2) ER fluids are susceptible to contamination which significantly
degrades performance; and,3) the strong electric fields required by ER fluids necessitate
complicated and expensive high-voltage power supplies and complex
control systems.Faced with these performance restrictions and searching for a
technological breakthrough to overcome them, Applicants turned to MR
fluids with renewed interest and sought to optimize systems employing
them. MR fluids inherently have higher yield strengths and are, therefore,
capable of generating greater damping forces. Further, contamination 
does not pose the performance degradation threat for MR
fluids that it does for ER fluids. Still further, MR fluids
are activated by magnetic fields which are easily produced
by simple, low-voltage electromagnetic coils.US-A-3174587, US-A-2661596 and JP-A-60113711 each
describe an MR damper which includes a housing containing a
magnetorheological fluid, a piston adapted for movement
therein, said piston including a ferrous metal and
incorporating a number of windings N of wire defining a coil
which when energised produces a magnetic flux in the piston.
FR-A-2579283 describes a mount with some similar features.It is therefore among the objects of the present
invention to provide an MR damper with improved performance
characteristics.defining dimensional/operational relationships which
provide improved performance;devising piston designs
