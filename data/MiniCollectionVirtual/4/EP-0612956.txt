<ABSTRACT>
A device for bundling the radiation of a radiation source has a reflector housing (1, 19) which is composed of an ellipsoid reflector (2, 20) formed as part of an ellipsoid having a primary and a secondary focal point as well as a spherical reflector (3, 21) formed as a calotte shell in such a manner that their concave sides face one another, the ellipsoid reflector (2, 20) being bounded in the direction of the spherical reflector (3) by an edge (5, 22) and a radiation source (10, 28) being furthermore inserted into the reflector housing (1, 19) in the region of the primary focal point (6, 25) and the spherical reflector (3, 21) having an opening (12, 30) in the axis (4, 24) of the ellipsoid reflector (2, 20) from where at least one radiation guide (13, 31) emanates. According to the invention, the edge (5, 22) is backwardly offset with respect to the primary focal point (6, 25) in such a manner that a beam which emanates from the radiation source (10, 28) or its image (11, 29) through the spherical reflector (3, 21) is reflected by the edge (5, 22) in such a manner that the reflected beam enters the radiation guide (3, 31) at such an angle with respect to the axis (4, 24) which is smaller than or equal to the limit angle for the total reflection in the radiation guide (13, 31).
