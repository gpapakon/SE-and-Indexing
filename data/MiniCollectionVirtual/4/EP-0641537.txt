<ABSTRACT>
An improved bathroom tissue dispenser (1) for holding 
both a large fresh roll (R) and a remnant roll (r) of bathroom 

tissues. The dispenser (1) has a base (3) with a spindle (7) on a main 
support area (5) of the base (3) for carrying the large fresh roll (R) 

of bathroom tissue. The base (3) has a secondary support area (35) 
beneath the main support area (5) with means thereon for carrying 

the remnant roll (r) of bathroom tissue directly beneath the 
large roll (R). The remnant roll (r) is carried with its axis 

perpendicular to the axis of the large roll (R). The spindle (7) 
preferably has a tubular body and detachable means for 

increasing the diameter of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed toward an improved 
bathroom tissue dispenser. The invention is also directed 
toward an improved spindle for holding bathroom tissue rolls. The invention is more particularly directed toward 
an improved tissue dispenser of the type that holds both 
a new roll of tissue and a remnant roll. The invention 
is also more particularly directed toward an improved spindle 
that can have its size changed to hold different sizes of 
cores. It is common now to employ large rolls of bathroom 
tissue because the large rolls reduce the number of times 
that the rolls must be replaced. By a large roll it is 
meant a roll at least nine inches in diameter but the roll 
can be twelve or more inches in diameter. However when 
the dispensers employing the large rolls are serviced it 
is common for the remnant roll to be thrown out before it 
is fully used up to avoid running out of tissue before the 
next servicing. Disposal of the remnant roll is wasteful. 
It is known to provide a dispenser that can hold both a 
new roll and a remnant roll at the same time so that the 
remnant roll can be used up before it is disposed of. This 
eliminates the waste of tissue. Examples of such dispensers 
are shown in U.S Patents 4,796,832 and 5,172,840. However 
these dispensers are quite large with complicated 
mechanisims, making them expensive to manufacture and 
maintain and awkward to use. In addition, in the known 
dispensers, the user is not led to use up the remnant roll  
 
before starting on the new roll so that the problem of waste 
can remain. It is the purpose of the present invention 
to provide an improved dispenser that holds both a fresh 
roll and a remnant roll of bathroom tissue with the dispenser 
being relatively compact compared to known dispensers of 
this type. The dispenser of the present invention is only 
slightly larger than a dispenser that employs only a large 
roll. In addition, the dispenser of the present invention 
is constructed to locate the remnant roll in a position 
where the user is led to use it up before use of the fresh 
large roll is started. The improved dispenser employs mounting means 
for the remnant roll just below the large roll, the mounting 
means located between the large roll and the outlet for 
the dispenser. Thus the user is led to use up the remnant 
roll before starting to use the fresh roll. The known dispensers are built with a spindle 
for the roll that fits a standard size of roll or more 
particularly a standard size of core used in the roll.

<CLAIMS>
A bathroom tissue dispenser having: a base, the 
base having a main support area and a secondary support 

area extending down from the main support area; a large 
roll spindle mounted in the central portion of the main 

support area, the axis of the spindle extending transversely 
to the main support area; secondary support means on the 

secondary support area for supporting a remnant roll, the 
axis of the secondary support means extending transverse 

to the axis of the spindle. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
1 including a cover, the cover having a dished main cover 

portion sized to cover a large roll mounted on the spindle; 
and a dished secondary cover portion extending downwardly 

from the main cover portion and sized to cover a remnant 
roll mounted on the secondary support means, there being 

an interior opening between the main cover portion and the 

secondary cover portion. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
2 wherein the cover is pivotally mounted onto the bottom 

of the base. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
2 wherein the dished secondary cover portion has a bottom 

outlet opening for the bathroom tissue, the bottom opening 
allowing access to the remnant roll when it is in place 

and the bottom opening and interior opening allowing access 
to the large roll when the remnant roll is used up. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
4 wherein the secondary support means comprise a pair of 

facing stub shafts on which the ends of a remnant roll are 
mounted. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
 

5 wherein the stub shafts are resiliently mounted so that 
they can be moved away from each other to mount the remnant 

roll thereon. 
A bathroom tissue as claimed in claim 5 wherein 
the spindle has a tubular body and detachable means for 

increasing the circumference of the body, the body and the 
circumference increasing means having cooperating means 

for detachably connecting them together. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
7 wherein the tubular body has longitudinally extending, 

circumferentially spaced apart slots, the circumference 
increasing means comprising ribs insertable into the slots. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
8 wherein the slots extend up from the bottom of the spindle 

body in its wall, each rib having a laterally offset 
longitudinal extending slot receiving the wall of the body 

above the slots in the body. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
9 wherein the slot in each rib divides the slotted portion 

of the rib into a wide portion and a narrow portion and 
wherein the rib can be mounted on the body in one position 

with the wide portion of the rib outermost from the body 
or in a second position with the narrow portion of the rib 

outermost from the body. 
A bathroom tissue dispenser as claimed in claim 
10 including cooperating means on the ribs and body for 

locking ribs in the slots in either position. 
A spindle for a bathroom tissue dispenser having 
a tubular body and detachable means for increasing the 

circumference of the body, the body and the circumference 
 

increasing means having cooperating means for detachably 
connecting them together. 
A spindle as claimed in claim 12 wherein the 
tubular body has longitudinally extending, circumferentially 

spaced apart slots, the circumference increasing means 
comprising ribs insertable into the slots. 
A spindle as claimed in claim 13 wherein the slots 
extend up from the bottom of the spindle body in its wall, 

each rib having a laterally offset longitudinal extending 
slot receiving the wall of the body above the slots in the 

body. 
A spindle as claimed in claim 14 wherein the slot 
in each rib divides the slotted portion of the rib into 

a wide portion and a narrow portion and wherein the rib 
can be mounted on the body in one position with the wide 

portion of the rib outermost from the body or in a second 
position with the narrow portion of rib outermost from the 

body.
