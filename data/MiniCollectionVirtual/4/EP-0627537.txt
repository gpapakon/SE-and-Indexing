<ABSTRACT>
The lock-bolt status detector (8) and the door panel position detector are connected on the output side to an electronic evaluation unit (6). The latter is housed in the door panel and connected to a transmitter (7) for radio communication of alarm states. The alarm centre (12) is provided with a receiver (15) which functions in unison with the transmitter. An independent power supply arrangement is provided for the status detector, the door position detector and the transmitter in the door panel.

<CLAIMS>
Door monitoring device with a bolt lock, which is provided with a bolt 
status detector located in the door leaf, having a door leaf position detector, 

as well as having an alarm control room, which triggers an alarm in the case of 
unauthorized opening of the door, characterized in that the bolt status 

detector (8) and the door leaf position detector are line-connected on the 
output side with an electronic evaluating unit (6) in the door leaf (2) and 

which is connected to a transmitter for the wireless transmission of alarms, 
that the alarm control room (12) is provided with a receiver (15), which 

cooperates with the transmitter (7), that the bolt status detector (8) is 
located in a recess made in the door leaf (2), that there is a connecting path 

from said recess to the bolt (17) by means of which the latter is in operative 
connection with the bolt status detector (8) and that an independent supply 

means for the bolt status detector (8), the door leaf position detector and the 
transmitter (7) is located in the door leaf (2). 
Door monitoring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
independent supply means comprises a battery or accumulator means. 
Door monitoring device according to claim 2, characterized in that there is 
a battery or accumulator means, which indicates by means of a prior warning 

the discharge state. 
Door monitoring device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the door leaf-side evaluating unit (6) and the transmitter (7) are 

jointly located in a housing (10) with the door leaf position detector.  
 
Door monitoring device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the bolt status detector (8) is constructed as a transmitted light 

barrier (11), whose components are located in facing recesses in the door 
leaf (2) and that the bolt (17) and the relevant lock parts are provided with 

a bore (18) for the formation of the light path. 
Door monitoring device according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the bolt status detector (8) is constructed as a reflected light 

barrier and that between the door leaf-side recess, which receives the reflected 
light barrier, and the bolt (17) there is a bore (18) for the formation of 

the light path in the interposed lock parts. 
Door monitoring device according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the bolt status detector (8) is constructed as an inductive proximity 

switch.
