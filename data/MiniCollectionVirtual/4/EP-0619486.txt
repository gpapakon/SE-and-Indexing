<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a solid-electrolyte sensor device for determining gas concentrations in measurement gases, having a sensor consisting of a solid electrolyte (6) which is arranged between at least two electrodes (5, 7), the electrodes being gas-permeable and at least one of the electrodes (5) lying facing the measurement chamber (4), and having electrical means for detecting and processing concentration-dependent sensor output values. In order to provide long-term prevention of disruptive adsorptions of measurement gas components on the sensor or on the corresponding sensor electrode, it is proposed to arrange in the vicinity of that sensor electrode (5) which faces the measurement gas an adjustable oxygen source (2), by means of which oxygen or oxygen radicals can be introduced into the measurement gas to oxidise the latter.
