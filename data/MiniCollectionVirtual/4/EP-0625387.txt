<ABSTRACT>
The strip casting machine has a casting nozzle (10), displaceable in the direction of flow (F) of the molten metal and adjustable perpendicular thereto, for feeding molten metal into the adjustable rolling nip (30) between rotating moulds (26, 28). The casting nozzle (10) consists of an upper and a lower nozzle element (14, 16) or, in the case of a vertical strip casting machine, of a left-hand and a right-hand nozzle element, articulated on a melt distribution trough and of two side limiters which form a slot-shaped outlet opening (20) for the molten metal. One or both of the nozzle elements (14, 16) is adjustable, at least in the region of the outlet opening (20). During the operation of the strip casting machine, the casting nozzle (10) is, for start-up, advanced with its outlet opening (20) into a starting position (S) and then pulled back into a working position (W), the outlet opening (20) being expanded, adapting to the rotating moulds (26, 28) in the process.

Strip casting plant for metals, in particular for
aluminium and aluminium alloys, with a casting nozzle (10)

displaceable in direction of flow (F) of the liquid metal
(35) and adjustable perpendicular to this, to supply

liquid metal (35) to the adjustable roller gap (30)
between rotating dies (26, 28), where the casting nozzle

(10) consists of two nozzle elements (14, 16) attached to
a melt distribution trough (12) and two side limiters

which form a slot-like outlet opening (20) for the liquid
metal (35),

characterised in that

one or both of the nozzle elements (14, 16) is adjustable
at least in the area of the outlet opening (20).
Strip casting plant according to Claim 1, characterised in
that at least one nozzle element (14, 16) of the casting

nozzle (10), preferably supported by a nozzle holder (34),
is mounted on melt distribution trough (12) to displace

parallel to and/or swivel about an axis (A
1
).
Strip casting plant according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that at least one nozzle element (14, 16)

has an axis (A
2
) parallel to the outlet opening (20) for
swivelling of a mouthpiece (18). 
Strip casting plant according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that on the melt distribution trough (12)

is arranged a hinge (22) mounted to swivel about an axis
(A
1
) and/or on a nozzle element (14, 16) is arranged a
hinge (22) mounted to swivel about an axis (A
2
), a textile
or strip hinge (60) or an inserted elastic block (58).
Strip casting plant according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that a nozzle element (14, 16) comprises

a thicker plate rigidly mounted on the melt
distribution trough (12) and a thinner mouthpiece plate

(18) articulately connected, where both plates are
essentially rectangular in cross section or bevelled.
Strip casting plant according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that in the area of nozzle lips (24),

sliding inserts (62) of a self-lubricating material
preferably graphite or hexagonal boron nitride, are

integrated into nozzle elements (14, 16) or mouthpiece
(18).
Strip casting plant according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that a tension spring (68) or for a

horizontal strip casting plant a counterweight (72) is
mounted on the rotatable mouthpiece (18) of a nozzle

element (14, 16), where applicable via at least one angle
piece (64, 66). 
Strip casting plant according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that an adjustment device with servo

control, preferably a spindle or linear guide with
servomotor or piston rod with a pneumatic or hydraulic

cylinder, acts on the swivelable mouthpiece (18) of a
nozzle element (14, 16), where applicable via an angle

piece (66).
Process for the operation of a strip casting plant
according to one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that

casting nozzle (10) is advanced at the start with the
outlet opening (20) in the start position (S) and then

withdrawn to work position (W), where the outlet opening
(20) is expanded according to the rotating dies (26,

28).
Process according to Claim 9, characterised in that during
withdrawal of an approximately horizontal casting nozzle

(10), the metallostatic pressure is increased preferably
by raising the level of the metal (50) in the melt

distribution trough (12).
