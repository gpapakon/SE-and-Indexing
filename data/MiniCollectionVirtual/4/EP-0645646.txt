<ABSTRACT>
A probe (10) for locating a buried cable (12) includes a casing (16) 
adapted to be driven into the earth (14). Situated in the casing is an RF receiver (23) 

for sensing RF energy radiated by the cable to establish the cable's approximate 
location. The casing also has a viewing window (19) in its lower tip (18) in optical 

communication with a television camera (30). The camera allows the cable, once its 
approximate location is established by the RF receiver, to be visually identified.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for accurately
locating a metallic cable to facilitate its identification.A sizable number of the cables used for telecommunication purposes
and for electrical power transmission are buried below ground. Underground burial
of cable, while more costly than stringing cable above ground on poles or towers,
nevertheless affords certain advantages. Burial of cable below ground is more
aesthetically pleasing and reduces the risk of cable damage due to lightning and
other elements. On the other hand, a buried cable is far more susceptible to damage
by digging due to construction or the like.To reduce the risk of an underground cable being severed or otherwise
becoming damaged as a result of nearby digging, most utilities a have a strict policy
requiring that any buried cable in the vicinity of such digging be physically located.
To physically locate a buried cable, a utility worker usually must excavate the earth
at spaced locations along the cable to expose the cable in order to verify its exact
location. Each such excavation is referred to as a "pothole."The starting location of each such pothole is obtained by first
establishing the approximate location of the cable. While a map may be helpful to
locate the cable generally, a more exact location is obtained by injecting a Radio
Frequency (RF) signal into the cable and then sensing the RF energy that is radiated
using an RF receiver for this purpose. The amount of RF energy that is sensed
increases as the proximity of the cable to the receiver increases. However, RF
sensing by itself does not provide a way of establishing the exact location of the
cable since electrical interference from other cables located close to the cable of
interest may cause a false measure of RF energy.Thus, the only accurate way to locate and identify a buried cable is to
dig a series of potholes to expose portions of the cable along its length. Depending
on the particular utility policy of how far apart such potholes should be, and the
extent of the digging that is to occur near the cable, a large number of such potholes
may be necessary. As may be appreciated, the process of digging each required
pothole is time consuming and extremely expensive. Thus, there is a need for a technique for locating and identifying a cable,
and particularly, a buried cable, with reduced effort and expense.EP-A-0 534 730 teaches a method for identifying and examining
cavities which might be present under a paved road. Reflective waves from
