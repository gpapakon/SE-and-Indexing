<ABSTRACT>
The microstrip antenna device comprises: a dielectric layer (CD), carrying, on one side, a conducting block (PC) of chosen form and, on the other, a conducting plane forming an earth plane (PM); and a feed circuit comprising at least one microstrip line (LM) connected to the conducting block (PC) and embedded in the dielectric layer (CD) in the same plane as the conducting block (PC). The thickness of the dielectric layer with respect to the microstrip line (EL) is greater than that with respect to the periphery of the said microstrip line (ML).

Microstrip antenna device comprising:

a dielectric layer (DC) carrying a conductive pad (PC) of
chosen shape on one side, and a conductive plane forming

an earth plane (PM) on the other side; and
a feed circuit comprising at least one microstrip line
(LM) connected to the conductive pad (PC) and implanted

in the dielectric layer (CD) in the same plane as the
conductive pad (PC),
the thickness of the dielectric layer in relation to the
conductive pad (EP) being greater than the thickness of

the said layer in relation to the periphery of the said
pad (EHP), and
the conductive pad (PC) and the microstrip line (LM)
being etched on a first face of a single-sided printed

circuit (CI),

characterized in that the thickness of the dielectric
layer in relation to the microstrip line (EL) is greater

than the thickness of the said layer in relation to the
periphery of the said line (EHL), and in that the said

first face is in direct contact with the dielectric layer
(CD) while the second face of the printed circuit acts as

a radome.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the substrate of the printed circuit (CI) consists

of a material based on glass and resin, of the epoxy
kind.
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the conductive plane forming the

earth plane (PM) consists of a metal plate embossed in 
relation to the conductive pad and the microstrip line.
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the metal plate is a stamped sheet.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the dielectric layer (CD) consists solely of air.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the thicknesses of the dielectric layer respectively

in relation to the periphery of the pad (EHP) and in
relation to the periphery of the microstrip line (EHL)

are substantially zero, the stamped sheet supporting the
printed circuit.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that it comprises an array of pads

implanted with their associated microstrip lines, and
implanted on the same printed circuit.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in
that it is associated with a frequency converter (CV)

conferring thereon a function of microwave receiver of
satellite television signals.
Device according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized
in that the pointing of the beam of the antenna is

continuously altered by construction by devising, with
regard to the microstrip line feed distributor of the

array of pads, an appropriate phase and/or time law.
