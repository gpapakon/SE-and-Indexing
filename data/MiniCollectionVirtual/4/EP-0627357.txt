<ABSTRACT>
A closure (10 for a vessel 12) comprises securing 
means (14) to secure the closure (10) to the vessel (12). 

The closure (10) also includes stop means (19) separate 
from the securing means (14). The stop means (19) can 

engage a stop element (24) on the vessel (12) to assist 
in preventing overtightening of the closure (10) on the 

vessel (12). 
In one embodiment the stop means will deform should the closure be 

overtightened, to allow venting of overpressure within the vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to closures, and particularly, but not exclusively,
to closures in the form of caps for containers adapted to hold effervescent
liquids.The bottling of effervescent liquids, for example, orangeade or lemonade
requires that the cap of the bottle is screwed on tight enough to prevent the
carbon dioxide in the liquid from escaping. Also, it is necessary that the cap is
not so tight that it is difficult for certain people, for example, children or the
elderly to unscrew the top.However, in some cases, the caps are screwed on so tightly that it is
difficult for such people to unscrew the cap. It is possible to purchase a tool
which will assist in the unscrewing of bottle caps which enables the user to
apply greater leverage to the cap than would be possible if they were using their
hands. The disadvantage of such a tool is that there is a tendency for users to
try to twist the cap in the wrong direction and effectively over tightening it.
This can cause the threads to be jumped. In view of the fact that the liquids in
the bottles can contain carbon dioxide there can be, in certain circumstances, a
build up of pressure inside the bottle. When the cap of the bottle is over
tightened such that the threads are jumped, the pressure inside the bottle can
cause the cap to be blown off at speeds of upto 400km/h (250mph) with a force
that can cause injury. The expression "missiling" is used in the art to describe
caps being blown off bottles in this way.Specification No. FR-A-2569661 discloses a bottle cap having a stop provided
on securing means to
prevent overtightening. DE-U-9206634 discloses a
screw cap according to the first part of claim 1 with a stop in the form of a raised portion
to prevent overtightening. However, the apparatuses
disclosed in these specifications do not fully overcome the above disadvantage.According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a closure for a
vessel, the closure comprising a side wall defining a cavity having a closed end,
an open end to receive a top region of the vessel, and securing means to secure 
the closure to the vessel, the securing means being in the form of threads
adapted to co-operate with corresponding threads on said top region of the
vessel, and stop means to engage a stop element on the vessel, the stop means
including a raised portion extending inwardly of the side wall, characterised in
that the stop means is separate from the securing means and further includes
an abutment extending from the raised portion towards the open

<CLAIMS>
A closure (10) for a vessel (12), the closure comprising a side wall (15)
defining a cavity (17) having a closed end (13), an open end (11) to receive a top

region of the vessel (12), and securing means to secure the closure (10) to the vessel
(12), the securing means being in the form of threads (14) adapted to co-operate

with corresponding threads (16) on said top region of the vessel (12), and stop
means to engage a stop element (24) on the vessel, the stop means including a

raised portion (18) extending inwardly of the side wall, characterised in that the
stop means is separate from the securing means (14) and further includes an

abutment (19) extending from the raised portion (18) towards the open end (13) of
the closure, the abutment (19) comprising a first sloping surface (20) and a second sloping

surface (21) sloping
towards and merging with the raised portion (18), the second sloping surface

(21) adapted to engage the stop element (24) on the vessel (12).
A closure according to Claim 1 wherein the stop means is arranged
adjacent the closed end (13) of the closure.
A closure according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the raised portion (18)
extends at least partially around the inner circumference of the side wall (15).
A closure according to Claim 3 wherein the raised portion (18) extends
substantially wholly around the inner circumference of the side wall (15).
A closure according to any preceding Claim wherein in the event of
overtightening the closure (10) on the vessel (12), the second sloping surface

(21) is adapted to co-operate with said stop element (24) to cause deformation of
said stop means, thereby causing said closure (10) to deform to create a gap

between the closure and the wall of the vessel (12) to allow any pressurised gas
in the vessel (12) to be released via said gap.
A closure according to any preceding Claim wherein the second sloping 
surface (21) slopes inwardly of the cavity (17) from the side wall (15) of the

closure (10) towards said first sloping surface (20).
A closure according to any of Claims 1 to 5 wherein the second sloping
surface (21) slopes from said raised portion (18) to said first sloping surface

(20) to define a V-shaped recess (22) with said raised portion (18) to receive said
stop element on the vessel (12).
A system characterised by a closure (10) as claimed in any of Claims 1 to
7, and a vessel (12) being provided with securing formations adapted to co-operate

with the securing means on the closure (10) to enable the closure (10) to
be secured to the vessel (12) by tightening the closure (10) thereto, and a stop

element (24) on the vessel (12) adapted to co-operate with the stop means on the
closure (10) to assist in preventing overtightening of the closure (10) on the

vessel (12).
A system according to Claim 8 characterised in that the stop element is
in the form of a shoulder (24) defined by said threads (16) on the vessel against

which the stop means on the closure can abut.
A system according to Claim 9 characterised in that the shoulder (24) is
defined at the end of the threads (16) closest to the open end of the vessel (12).
A system according to Claim 9 characterised in that the stop element is
separate from the threads (16) on the vessel (12) and is in the form of a

protrusion extending from the vessel (12).
A system according to Claim 11 characterised in that the protrusion is
provided adjacent the top of the vessel (12).
A system according to any of Claims 8 to 12 characterised in that the
stop element has a flattened surface (25) extending transverse to the wall of the

vessel, said flattened surface being provided a lip (27) extending along an edge 
thereof remote from the wall of the vessel.
A system according to Claim 13 characterised in that the stop element
has a further flattened surface (28) extending substantially parallel to the wall

of the vessel (12), the distance of said further flattened surface (28) from the
wall of the vessel (12) is less than the height of the remainder of the threads

(16) at said top region.
A system according to Claim 13 or 14 characterised in that when the
closure (10) is overtightened on the vessel (12), said lip (27) co-operates with the

stop means thereby causing some of the material of the stop means to be
scraped off by the lip (27), to collect between the lip (27) and the first

mentioned flattened surface (25) thereby increasing the resistance against
overtightening.
A method of forming a closure (10) characterised by providing a vessel
(12) as to which the closure (10) is to be secured, applying a first mark to said

vessel (12) in alignment with a stop element (24), tightening the closure (10) onto
the vessel until a predetermined degree of tightness is attained, applying a

second mark to the closure (10) in alignment with said first mark, and

thereafter using the marked closure (10) as a guide to manufacture closures as
claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7.
