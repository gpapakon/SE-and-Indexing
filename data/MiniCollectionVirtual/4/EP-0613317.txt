<ABSTRACT>
The speaker system of the invention 
comprises an acoustic tube with one end coupled to the 

back side of the speaker unit and the other end released to 
a sound field space through an opening window, and at least 

one air chamber is disposed on the way of the route of the 
acoustic tube, in which the sectional area of the air chamber 

is set larger than the sectional area of the acoustic 
tube, and the sectional area of the opening window is set 

smaller than the sectional area of the acoustic tube, and 
therefore the air chamber composes an acoustic filter so 

that the resonance frequency components of high degree in 
the acoustic tube may not be radiated from the opening 

window, and formation of peaks and bottoms of frequency 
characteristic due to interference with the sound radiated 

from the front side of the speaker is prevented. The opening 
window of a small sectional area lowers the resonance 

frequency of the acoustic tube. 
The speaker system of the invention according to an other embodiment, 
comprises an acoustic tube with one end coupled to the 

back side of the speaker unit and the other end released to 
a sound field space through an opening window, and at least 

one branch chamber; 
the branch chamber possessing different route 

lengths causes a phase difference in the acoustic tube to 
cancel the resonance in the acoustic tube, so that formation 

of peaks and bottoms in the frequency characteristic may be 
prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to means for enhancing
the frequency characteristic and efficiency of a speaker
system expanded in the bass register by coupling an acoustic
tube to the back side of a speaker unit.A speaker system expanded in the bass register by
coupling an acoustic tube to the back side of a speaker unit
has been known so far.The conventional speaker system is described below-with
reference to a drawing. Fig. 5 is a sectional view showing
the constitution of a conventional speaker system. In the
diagram, numeral 1 denotes a cabinet, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e
are partitions for composing an acoustic tube by partitioning
the inside of the cabinet 1, 3 is an open window 
disposed in the lower part of a front panel of the cabinet
1, and 4 is a speaker unit disposed above the front panel.In this constitution, the operation is described below.
The partitions 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e disposed in the cabinet
1 compose an acoustic tube in the cabinet 1, and the sound
delivered from the back side of the speaker unit 4 is radiated
from the open window 3 through the acoustic tube.The acoustic tube resonates at a specific determined frequency
fn. Supposing the overall
length of the acoustic tube to be L and the sound velocity
in the air to be C, the resonance frequency fn is expressed
as
fn = (C/4L) x (n+1)
where n is 0, 1, 2, or any other integer.In the case of n=0, that is, at the frequency resonating
with 1/4 wavelength in the acoustic tube, the
acoustically magnified sound is radiated from the open
window 3 of the acoustic tube, and the efficiency is notably
enhanced near the frequency at the reproduction limit of
bass. At n=1, that is, at the frequency resonating with 1/2
wavelength in the acoustic tube, the sound is radiated
from the front side of the speaker unit 4, while the
sound from the back side is inverted in phase by delay of
half wavelength in the acoustic tube, and is radiated from
the open window 3. Both sounds added in the front
space of the cabinet 1, so that the sound pressure level
increases at that frequency.At n=2, that is, at the frequency resonating with 3/4
wavelength in the acoustic tube, same as in the case
of n=0, the acoustically magnified sound is radiated from
the open window 3.Thus, in the bass region, a speaker system of high
efficiency has been realized.In such conventional constitution of speaker system,
however, even at the frequency of medium and high frequency
region corresponding to n=3 or higher, resonance occurs in
the acoustic tube, and the sound is radiated from
