<ABSTRACT>
A first signal plane (22) having a first conductor pitch and dielectric 
thickness, is provided for critical signals determined based on sensitivity to cross-talk 

and line resistance. A second signal plane (24) having a conductor density 
of approximately a factor of four greater than the first signal plane and reduced 

dielectric thickness, is provided for non-critical signals. Multi-layer arrangements 
employing signal planes of the first and second types are combined in printed 

wiring boards for multi-chip module systems to provide maximum overall density 
with greatest miniaturization while maintaining signal integrity and adapting 

available design processes for cost-effective implementation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of printed wiring
boards for Multi-Chip Module (MCM) systems for the attachment of and signal
distribution between multiple integrated circuit chips. In particular, the present
invention provides a method for design of a multi-layer printed wiring
board.Mounting and interconnection of modern integrated circuits is
typically accomplished through the use of Printed Wiring Boards (PWB). The
connection of numerous chips in modern MCM systems for high performance
computers requires multi-layer PWBs and the technological requirements for
increased chip density, higher signal frequencies, and increased design
complexity place high demands on PWB design techniques and manufacturing
processes. The desired capabilities of PWBs are low resistance, constant
transmission line impedance, high density of conductors, low cross-talk between
conductors, high propagation velocity, low signal timing skew between multiple
paths, ability to terminate lines in a characteristic impedance, and engineering
change capability.Development of a PWB requires engineering trade-offs between the desired
characteristics. Simultaneously achieving the desired characteristics is difficult.
Low resistance and low cross-talk are incompatible with high density of 
conductors. Similarly, desire for high propagation velocity in combination with
high density necessarily reduces the capability to perform engineering changes
without redesign of PWB layers.Various manufacturing and design techniques for multi-layer PWBs exist.
Stripline and microstrip technologies are used singly or in combination in multi-layer
PWBs for control of cross-talk and impedance. Buried microstrip
technology and dual stripline technology are exemplary of improvements in the
art to further refine basic design capabilities for multi-layer PWBs.The complex routing of conductors in the various layers and between
layers, and the extremely high density necessary in modern PWBs typically
requires the use of Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems for generation of the
PWB layouts. CAD systems employing gridded design and gridless design have
been employed for modern designs. Gridded systems require placement of
conductors on a given grid spacing while allowing differing conductor width.
Gridless systems typically employ a fixed separation of conductors while similarly
allowing varying conductor widths. Present CAD systems employ identical
mechanical and electrical characteristics such as pitch of the conductors and
impedance for a

A method for designing a multi-layer printed
wiring board in which a plurality of signal planes are

stacked in overlapping relation for carrying a
plurality of signals, comprising the steps of:


categorizing some of the signals to be carried by
the printed wiring board as critical signals, said

critical signals being those signals requiring low
cross-talk and low signal line resistance;
defining first design rules for first conductor
in-plane spacing and first conductor characteristics to

meet the requirements for avoiding degradation of the
critical signals;
identifying a direction on the printed wiring
board, intended for bus interconnection, as a favored

direction;
defining a first set of adjacent signal planes in
which the first design rules are employed, including at

least one "y" plane having conductors oriented at
substantially 0° relative to the favored direction, at

least one "x" plane having conductors oriented at
substantially 90° to the favored direction and at least

one "y'" plane having conductors oriented at
substantially 0° with respect to the favored direction,

said conductors of the "y'" plane being offset between
the conductors of the "y" plane by approximately

one-half of said first conductor in-plane spacing;
laying out said first set of signal planes with a
said "y" plane, "x" plane and "y'" plane arranged in

succession in overlapping relation in the printed

defining second design rules for second conductor

laying out in the printed wiring board at least a

power plane or a ground plane, above and below and in
overlapping relation with said first set of signal

planes; and
laying out a second set of signal planes in
