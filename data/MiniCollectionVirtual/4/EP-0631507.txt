<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a simple process for the modification of, e.g., anti-TAA antibodies, which alters their immunogenicity so that their ability to induce an anti-isotypic response is selectively diminished, while they remain able to elecit an anti-idiotypic response. The latter is of potential immunotherapeutic value, i.e., by activation of the idiotype-anti-idiotype network. This modification takes the form of a controlled and partial reduction of the antibody; effector regions are retained. The invention should permit repeat injections (for diagnosis and therapy) and reduce HAMA interference in serodiagnostic assays.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SELECTIVE ALTERATION OF ANTIBODY IMMDNOGENICITY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to a method of altering the immunogenicity of antibodies so that, upon administration to a suitable subject, an immune response is elicited which is predominantly anti-idiotypic rather than anti-isotypic in character.Description of the Background Art All vertebrates possess a surveillance mechanism, called the immune system, that protects them from pathogenic microorganisms(including viruses), multicellular parasites, and cancer cells.The immune system specifically recognizes and selectively eliminates these undesirables by a process known as the immune response. One of its two important subsystems is the humoral immune system, which relies on antibodies, produced in quantity by plasma cells, that circulate through the blood and the lymphatic fluid.The first step in the immune response is the recognition of the presence of a foreign entity. Antigens are molecules which are subject to immune recognition. The portion of an antigen to which an antibody binds is called its antigenic determinant, or epitope. Not all antigens are capable of eliciting a response, as opposed to simple molecular recognition, from the immune system. Antigens which can elicit an immune response are termed immunogens, and are usually macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, of at least 5000 Daltons molecular weight. However, many small nonimmunogenic molecules, termed haptens, can stimulate an immune response if associated with a large carrier molecule.Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins. They have two principal functions. The first is to recognize (bind) foreign antigens. The second is to mobilize other elements of the immune system to destroy the foreign entity. The basic unit of immunoglobulin structure is a complex of four polypeptides -- two identical low molecular weight ("light") chains and two identical high molecular weight ("heavy") chains,SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

linked together by both nocovalent associations and by disulfide bonds. Different antibodies will have anywhere from one to five of these basic units. The immunoglobulin unit may be represented schematically as a "Y" . Each branch of the "Y" is formed by the amino terminal portion of a heavy chain and an associated light chain. The base of the "Y" is formed by the carboxy terminal portions of the two heavy chains. The node of the "Y" is the so- called hinge region, and is quite flexible. Five

CLAIMS
1. Use of an antibody in at least partially reduced form in the manufacture of a composition for the treatment of a disease associated with an antigen specifically bound by said antibody, said reduced antibody eliciting at least some antiÂ¬ idiotypic anti-antibody response in a subject having said disease, but no more than a substantially decreased, if any, anti-isotype anti-antibody response, relative to the response which said antibody would have elicited had it been adaministered without said reduction.
2. The use of claim 1 wherein the antibody is repeatedly administered to the subject.
3. The use of claim l wherein the disease is a cancer and the antibody recognizes a tumor-associated antigen. 4. The use of claim 3 in which the cancer is an ovarian cancer.
5. The use of claim 3 in which the cancer is an adenocarcinoma.
6. The use of claim 1 in which the antibody is reduced with an agent selected from the group consisting of formamidine sulfonic acid, mercurous ion, stannous ion, cyanide ion, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium borohydride, dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol, mercaptoethanolamine, and thioredoxin. 7. The use of claim 1 in which the antibody is reduced with stannous ion.
8. The use of claim 6 in which the reduced antibody is labeled with technetium or rhenium.
9. A method of partially reducing an antibody which comprises reacting the antibody with a source of stannous ion in a tartrate buffer containing greater than 0.05M tartrate.
10. A method of radiolabeling an antibody which comprises partially reducing the antibody by the method cf claim 9 to obtain an antibody with at least one free sulfhydryl group, and then reacting the partially reduced antibody with a pertechnetate or perrhenate salt to obtain a technetium- or rhenium-labeled antibody.

 11. Use of a radiolabeled antibody in at least partially reduced form in the manufacture of a composition for the immunodetection by in vivo imaging of a disease associated with an antigen specifically bound by said antibody, said r.io reduced antibody eliciting at least some anti-idiotypic anti- antibody response in a subject having said disease, but no more than a substantially decreased, if any, anti-isotype anti-antibody response, relative to the response which said ""antibody would have elicited had it been administered without said reduction.
