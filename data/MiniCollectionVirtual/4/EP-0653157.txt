<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a centrifugal compressor which sends compressed air to at least one injector (20) placed upstream of the neck (16) of a convergent-divergent (venturi), so as to entrain the surrounding air by Venturi effect. The convergent-divergent may itself be of flattened shape, but it is preferable to group a plurality of parallel convergent-divergents (14) along a line parallel to the maximum elongation of the cross-section of the air flow to be created. The device comprises blower panels (7), with box structure, through which the convergent-divergents penetrate in leaktight fashion. The internal volume of the box (7) constitutes a compressed air manifold (collector) connected, on the one hand, to the compressor and, on the other hand, to the injectors (20) via ducts (21, 22, 23).

A device for producing an air stream having a flattened shape in
transverse section, this device comprising:


at least two diffusers, each one formed of a convergent-divergent pipe
(14) open at both ends, these diffusers being placed in the plane of the longest

dimension of the transverse section of the air stream which it is desired to
obtain, and
an injector (20) associated with each diffuser (14), more or less coaxial
with the pipe forming the diffuser, and situated in its convergent part, being

directed toward the divergent part, said injector (20) being connected by
compressed-air conveying means (5) to a centrifugal compressor (4) such that

the compressed air produced by the compressor and sprayed by the injector sets
the air located in the diffuser into motion or accelerates it, by a venturi effect,

characterized in that it comprises a box structure (7) which can be fed
with compressed air by the centrifugal compressor and constitutes a manifold,

said box structure having passing through it in leaktight fashion separate
passages (14) which are situated in the plane of the longest dimension of the

transverse section of the air jet to be produced, said passages being of
convergent-divergent shape and constituting the diffusers, and said injectors (20)

being placed inside the passages (14) and being connected to the inside of the
box structure (7) by feed pipes.
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the feed pipes of the
injectors (20) comprise an auxiliary manifold (21), which feeds each of the

injectors (20) via a pipe (22) connected, via other pipes (23), to the inside of the
box structure (7) which forms a main manifold.
The device of one of claims 1 or 2, and comprising means (24;28;29)
for atomizing treatment product, these means being located close to the outlets 

(17) of the diffusers (14), in the direction of movement of the air, characterized
in that said means (24;28;29) are also borne by the box structure (7).
The device of claim 3, characterized in that the atomization means are
spray heads (24) placed in cavities (25) of the box structure (7).
The device of claim 3, characterized in that the atomization means
comprise a break-up piece (28) which has a rounded edge pointing toward

upstream of the gaseous flow and a ridge with a sharp angle pointing in the
opposite direction, and a means (29) for feeding with treatment liquid capable

of creating, over at least part of the break-up piece, a substantially continuous
coating of said liquid, the break-up piece and the feed means being placed in

the region of an outlet of the injector (20) and of a part (16) of minimal cross-section
of the convergent-divergent formed by the passage (14).
The device according to one of claims 3-5, and wherein the
atomization means (24;28;29) are separately connected to a common feed pipe

(27) characterized in that this pipe is housed, at least in part, in a groove (26) of
the box structure (7).
The device according to one of claims 3-6, and wherein the
atomization means (24;28;29) are separately connected to a common feed pipe

(27), characterized in that this pipe which passes, at least in part, inside the box
structure and/or a pipe for supplying compressed air in the box structure.
The device according to one of claims 1-7, characterized in that at
least one passage (14) passing through the box structure (7) exhibits an overall

rectangular shape in cross-section in an intake zone of its convergent part, and
exhibits an overall circular section in an outlet zone of its divergent part.
The device according to one of claims 1-8, characterized in that at
least one helical blower (30) is associated with at least one diffuser so as to

create in the latter an air flow which will be accelerated by venturi effect when
the injector comes into action, and so as to produce a supercharging effect. 
The device according to one of claims 1-8, characterized in that said
device is made up as an assembly of unitary box structures connected to one

another in leaktight fashion.
The device of claim 10, characterized in that the adjacent box
structures are open at their ends which face each other, and connected together

by sleeves or, preferably, by fitting into each other.
The device of one of claims 1-11, characterized in that stoppers are
provided which have a shape designed to close off at least one injector (20),

being held in place by the convergent part of the corresponding passage (14).
