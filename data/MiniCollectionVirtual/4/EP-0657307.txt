<ABSTRACT>
The instrument (10) includes an elongated plate 
(12) having a straight edge (22) and a measurement 

region (20). A protractor plate (14) is connected to 
the elongated plate (12) and cooperates with a 

rotatable center dial (18) for the drawing and 
measuring of angles. The instrument (10) also 

preferably includes holes (30) through the elongated 
plate (12). The holes (30) are configured to receive a 

marking instrument so the device can be used as a 
compass. Additionally, an attachment region (50) 

allows the instrument (10) to be held in a conventional 
ring binder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
instruments for measuring and drawing, and particularly 
to instruments designed to simplify certain measuring and 
drawing activities. Various measuring and drawing tasks are 
performed by people from all walks of life, e.g. 
draftsmen, designers, engineers, artists, and children 
learning geometry. A wide variety of instruments exists 
to assist such people in performing the various drawing 
and measurement tasks. Examples of these instruments 
include compasses, straight edges, rulers, protractors, 
templates, and french curves. Thus, performance of 
numerous measuring and drawing tasks has required both 
proficiency at using a variety of instruments and the 
physical collection of such instruments. Sometimes the functions of different 
instruments have been combined into a single instrument. 
For example, some devices combine a straight edge, ruler, 
and template. Other devices combine compasses, straight 
edges, and rulers by using a disk rotatably mounted in a 
rigid sheet. The rigid sheet includes a straight edge 
having markings for drawing straight lines or measuring 
between points. The sheet and disk further include holes 
for receiving a writing instrument to form arcs and 
circles as with a compass. For instance, a user would 
hold the rotatable disk over a pad of paper, insert a  
 
writing instrument into one of the holes in the rigid 
sheet, and rotate the sheet and writing instrument about 
the disk to form a constant radius arc. One problem with 
such devices is the relatively limited number of 
functions that can be performed. For example, precise 
angles cannot be measured and drawn. Other disadvantages 
include the complexity of some devices, particularly if 
such devices are to be used as educational tools for 
children. Still other devices, such as that disclosed in 
Kirkegaard, U.S. Patent No. 3,474,538, have a single 
plate configured to perform the functions of straight 
edge, ruler, template, protractor, and compass. Although 
such a device can be used for a variety of functions, it 
cannot be used as easily or as accurately as often 
desired. Again, this is particularly true if the device 
is to be used by children learning to draw and measure 
various geometrical configurations. Also, the Kirkegaard 
device does not include a rotatable dial or disk to help 
a user draw both arcs and angles. Another common problem with existing designs is 
the crowding of components and the difficulty in 
perceiving the meaning of the various scales
