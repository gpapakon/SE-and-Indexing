A pipetting aid for exerting suction on liquids, 
comprising an elastic hollow body (1) with a larger ball-like 

central body (2) and with a first tubular attachment 
(3) and a second tubular attachment (4) from which second 

tubular attachment (4) a third tubular attachment (5) leaves 
at an angle, characterized in that 


(i) in the first tubular attachment (3), an easily removable 
check valve is disposed as a first closure component (6); 
(ii) the check valve is disposed such that when the ball-like 
central body (2) is squeezed, it allows, without 

further actuation, the compressed air from inside the hollow 
body into the outer atmosphere but not vice versa, when at 

the same time the second and third closure component (7) and 
(8) in the corresponding attachments (4) and (5) adopt a 

position which prevents air from passing from the inside to 
the outside; 
(iii) the check valve is a cylindrical body in which 
(iv) at least one cylinder base area is closed over its 
entire area; 
(v) the cylindrical body has at least one opening or cavity 
in its cylindrical part suitable for the passage of air 

between the cylinder wall and inner wall of the attachment 
(3); and 
(vi) the cylindrical body has a projecting shoulder (14) on 
the outer side of the lower cylindrical jacket, said 

shoulder running obliquely towards the inner side (15) of 
the cylindrical jacket (12). 
A pipetting aid according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the hollow body (1) consists of a single piece of a 

rubber-elastic material, particularly made of natural 
rubber. 
A pipetting aid according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the diameter of the tubular first attachment (3) is  

 
in a ratio of 1:2 to 1:4, preferably 1:2.5 to 1:3.5, 

particularly 1:3.0 to 1:3.4 to the diameter of the ball-like 
central body (2). 
A pipetting aid according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the check valve is a substantially 

rigid cylindrical body in which at least one base area is 
closed over its entire area and which comprises one or 

several cavities for the passage of air on the outer side of 
the cylindrical jacket (12), the outer side being towards 

the inner wall of the attachment (3), that through its seat 
in the elastic first tubular attachment (3), when the air is 

compressed inside the ball-like central body (2), the said 
valve creates one or several passages between the valve body 

and the inner wall of the attachment (3) which inner wall 
fits closely in the remaining part. 
A pipetting aid according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the first closure component (6) is a 

non-elastic cylindrical hollow body, the outward pointing 
upper base area (11) of which is a closed projecting lid and 

the hollow body comprising, in its cylindrical jacket (12), 
at least one continuous bore (13) and the base area (17) of 

said hollow body being open, inside towards the ball-shaped 
enlargement, a projecting shoulder (14) being located at the 

outer side of the lower cylindrical jacket, said shoulder 
running conically to the inner side (15) of the cylindrical 

jacket (12). 
A pipetting aid according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that underneath the projecting upper base 

area (11) in the cylindrical jacket (12) of the closure 
component (6), an annular round groove (18) is formed in the 

cylindrical jacket (12) which contacts an annular lip (9) 
said lip being disposed at the inner upper edge of the 

attachment (3).  
 
A pipetting aid according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the projecting shoulder (14) of the 

closure component (6) is disposed at a distance from the 
groove (18), such that when the lip (9) contacts the groove 

(18), the annular surface of the shoulder (14) rests 
positively at the attachment area of the spherical 

enlargement (2). 
A pipetting aid according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a low-volume enlargement of the attachment is provided 

in the area where the third attachment (5) runs into the 
second attachment (4). 
Process for the production of a pipetting aid made of a 
rubber-elastic material by means of the injection moulding 

process, characterized in that a thermoplastic moulding 
material is injected into a two-piece, closed mould in the 

conventional manner at a high temperature, a moulding core 
being disposed inside the mould, the hollow chamber formed 

by the inner surface of the outer mould and the outer 
surface of the moulding core corresponding to a hollow body 

(1) with a ball-like central body (2) and a first tubular 
attachment (3) and a second tubular attachment (4) disposed 

for instance on the opposite side, from which second tubular 
attachment (4) a third tubular attachment (5) leaves at an 

angle, and after the material has cooled, the moulding core, 
immediately following the removal from the two-piece mould, 

is removed by enlarging the attachment (3) of the single-piece 
rubber-elastic hollow body, and the pipetting aid is 

then completed by inserting three corresponding closure 
components in the three attachments, the diameter of the 

tubular first attachment (3) being in a ratio of 1:2 to 1:4, 
preferably 1:2.5 to 1:3.5, particularly 1:3.0 to 1:3.4 to 

the diameter of the ball-like central body (2).  
 
Process according to claim 9, characterized in that the 
hollow body (1) consists of a single piece of a rubber-elastic 

material, preferably natural rubber.
