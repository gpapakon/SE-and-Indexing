<ABSTRACT>
Box loading and unloading apparatus for loading assembled 
blocks of product items into boxes and unloading product 

blocks therefrom, wherein means (28,46) are provided to 
locate and retain the box (30), which is at least 

partially opened, and a pusher plate (34,54) spanning 
the product block (20) is used to push the block into or 

out of the box from or on to a transporter means (22,52).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automatic box loading and/or 
box unloading apparatus. Many products are packed into boxes for ease of handling 
and protection during storage and transit. Items which 
are not free-flowing are often difficult to pack automatically 
and loading into boxes is carried out manually. This 
is particularly but not exclusively the case with plastics 
containers and lids, which are used for packing a variety 
of goods, mainly foods such as margarine, cream, yoghurt, 
etc. These containers and lids are formed by processes such as 
thermo-forming and/or injection moulding and, on exit from 
the forming equipment, are generally formatted for packing 
into sticks of a length convenient for manhandling. 
Typically a box may contain about 1000 pieces in 20 sticks 
of 50 items. The containers are designed to 'nest' inside each other and 
they generally form stable stacks which can be fairly 
readily handled. Lids, however, form unstable stacks which 
must be handled very carefully. Invariably both types of 
product are passed through a printing process after 
manufacture, but because the manufacturing and printing 
machines work at very different rates it is not usually 
possible to link them as a continuous process. Typically, 
products are manufactured at rates up to 50,000 items per 
hour per machine and printed at rates up to 25,000 parts 
per hour per machine. Thus, the common practice is to  
 
pack the unprinted items into boxes directly after 
manufacture and then pass them through the printing 
machine at a later time. This means that the products 
must be unloaded from boxes, fed into a printer, and then 
re-loaded into boxes. A further complication with food containers is that 
hygiene regulations require a flexible plastics liner to 
be placed into the boxes to protect the contents from the 
ingress of dust or other contaminants during storage and 
transit. This liner has created many difficulties in 
previous attempts to automate the loading and unloading 
of boxes. Only one automatic box loader/unloader is known to be 
available currently, and this machine is very expensive and 
can handle round tubs only. Lids of any shape and 
rectangular tubs cannot be handled in this known equipment. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided box loading apparatus which comprises a locating 
means over which in use is fitted a box to be loaded, 
which box is open only at one vertically faced end, and a 
pushing plate which spans a block of assembled items to 
be

<CLAIMS>
A method of box loading according to which an empty 
box (30) to be loaded is located with one vertical end 

face open, and a block (20) of assembled product items to 
be loaded is pushed into the box and then further push 

the block so that the loaded box is pushed out of the 
located position to enable its open end to be closed. 
Box loading apparatus for use in carrying out the 
method of claim 1, comprising a locating means over which 

in use is fitted a box to be loaded, which box is open 
only at one vertically faced end, and a pushing plate 

which spans a block of assembled items to be loaded into 
the box and is operable horizontally to push the block 

into the box and then further push the loaded box off 
the locating means on to a supporting surface to enable 

its open end to be closed. 
Box loading apparatus according to claim 2, wherein 
the locating means is a hollow, open-ended spigot of the 

same shape as the box to be loaded but with slightly 
smaller outside dimensions. 
A method of box unloading according to which a 
loaded box (30) to be unloaded is located with its 

vertical end faces open, and a block (20) of product 
items filling the box is pushed out of the box on to a 

transporting means (52), leaving the box retained by the 
locating means (46) for removal and re-use. 
A method according to claim 4, according to which 
the product block is contained within a flexible box 

liner (56) which is retained when the product block is 
 

pushed out of the box. 
A method according to claim 5, according to which 
the liner is retained by means of suction (54). 
A method according to claim 5, in which the product 
block is pushed sufficiently far out of the box to turn 

the retained liner inside-out. 
Box unloading apparatus for carrying out the method 
of any of claims 4 to 7, comprising a locating means 

within which in use is fitted a box loaded with a block 
of items to be unloaded, the box being open at both 

vertically faced ends, and a pushing plate slightly 
smaller than the cross-section of the box operable 

horizontally to push the block of items out of the box 
on to a supporting surface and retractable to enable the 

empty box to be recovered from the spigot. 
Apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the locating 
means comprises a pair of rigid side guides for the box, 

to which the opened box is attached. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 3, 8 or 9, 
wherein the product block is loaded from a tray movable 

by a conveyor and/or is unloaded on to a tray movable by 
a conveyor. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 and 2 or 
claims 8 to 10, wherein prepared boxes with one or both 

vertical end faces open are stored in a buffer from which 
said prepared boxes are automatically conveyed and 

located at the locating means. 
Production apparatus according to claims 3, 8 and 
10, comprising at least one box loader, at least one box 

unloader, and at least one tray/conveyor system for 
handling blocks of product items assembled by a collator.
