<ABSTRACT>
In the preparation of ethane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid diesters (I) from the corresponding methanedicarboxylic diester (II), formaldehyde and hydrogen, the formaldehyde is used at 1.0-2.0 moles per mole of (II) and the reaction mixture, or an isolated 1-hydroxypropane-2,2-dicarboxylic acid diester (III), is subjected to thermolysis at 50-300 degrees C. Preparation of ethane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid diesters of formula (I) involves reacting the corresponding methanedicarboxylic diester of formula (II), formaldehyde and hydrogen. The formaldehyde is used at 1.0-2.0 moles per mole of (II). The reaction mixture, or an isolated 1-hydroxypropane-2,2-dicarboxylic acid diester of formula (III), is subjected to thermolysis at 50-300 degrees C. R1, R2 = alkyl, aralkyl, aryl or cycloalkyl of 1-12C, or together form a hydrocarbon chain.

A process for the preparation of a 2-methyl-1,3-dicarboxylate
of the general formula I



in which R
1
 and R
2
 independently of one another are an
alkyl, aralkyl, aryl or cycloalkyl group having from 1

to 12 carbon atoms or are a common part of a hydrocarbon
chain, by reaction of a 1,3-dicarboxylate of the general

formula II


with formaldehyde and hydrogen in the presence of a
Knoevenagel catalyst which is acidic or basic in

character and a hydrogenation catalyst,
characterized in that
, based on 1.0 mol of the dicarboxylate 
of the general formula II, from 1.0 to 2.0 mol

of formaldehyde are used, and the reaction mixture or
compound of the general formula III



isolated therefrom is then subjected to thermolysis at
temperatures of from 50°C to 300°C.
A process according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the thermolysis of the reaction mixture or of the isolated
compound of the general formula III is carried out

in the presence of a solvent or solvent mixture which is
preferably identical to that already used in the preceding

reaction.
A process according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the thermolysis is carried out in the presence of a
homogeneously dissolved catalyst, the catalyst being

used in amounts of from 0.01 g to 50.0 g, preferably
from 0.1 to 2 g and in particular from 0.5 to 1.6 g,

per mole of the 1,3-dicarboxylate of the general formula
II used for the methylation.
A process according to claim 3,
characterized in that

the homogeneously dissolved catalyst is a copper compound.
A process according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

the thermolysis is carried out in the presence of a,
preferably copper-containing, catalyst fixed to a

support material.
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
characterized in that

the thermolysis is carried out under a reduced pressure
of from 5 mbar to 900 mbar.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

the solution used for the thermolysis is fed into a
reaction medium which is circulated over a fixed-bed

catalyst and heated to thermolysis temperature, and is
sufficiently stable under the thermolysis conditions.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that

the solution used for the thermolysis is fed into a
reaction medium which contains the homogeneously

dissolved catalyst, is heated to thermolysis temperature
and is sufficiently stable under the thermolysis conditions,

and which is circulated over a large-area heat
exchanger, preferably of the falling-film, thin-layer or

short-path evaporator type.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

the thermolysis is carried out continuously.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

isolation of the compound of the general formula III is
dispensed with, and the reaction mixture of the reaction

of a 1,3-dicarboxylate of the general formula II with
formaldehyde and hydrogen is subjected directly, with or

without removal of the hydrogenation catalyst, to
thermolysis.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

a compound of the general formula III unreacted during
the thermolysis is again subjected, with or without the

addition of catalysts, to thermolysis. 
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

a compound of the general formula III unreacted during
the thermolysis is converted, by reaction with organic

acids or anhydrides thereof, acid chlorides or
silylating agents, into a temperature-stable secondary

product which can be removed by distillation.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

a compound of the general formula III unreacted during
the thermolysis is converted, by reaction with acetic

anhydride, into a secondary product which can be removed
by distillation.
