<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic condensation
polymers which are terpolymers having aromatic polyester,
polysiloxane and polycarbonate segments. These polymers
exhibit non-Newtonian melt viscosities, advantageous low
temperature properties and resistance to solvents,
chemicals, hydrolysis and to photodecomposition. The
terpolymers are especially useful as engineering
thermoplastics.Condensation copolymers having polysiloxane and
polycarbonate blocks are known. Representative of such
polymers are those disclosed by Schmidt et al., U. S. Pat.
4,681,922, Vaughn, U. S. Pat. 3,189,662, Vaughn, U. S. Pat.
3,419,635, and Merritt, U. S. Pat. 3,832,419. Some of
these copolymers, while useful, have lower than desired
flow properties, requiring high torque or high molding
pressures during processing. From the standpoint of ease
of processing, it is desirable for a thermoplastic to have
higher melt flow properties. This makes possible rapid and
complete mold filling and is especially important for
molding complex and thinwalled articles.Other siloxane-carbonate copolymers, such as described
by Vaughn, U. S. Pat. 3,419,635, have an elastomeric
character and are not considered as engineering
thermoplastics, being more useful as adhesives, coatings,
sealants, roofing material, impact modifying additives and
the like.Shortcomings of other siloxane-carbonate polymers are
inadequate impact strength at low temperatures and
inadequate resistance to distortion at elevated
temperatures. Another property which needs improvement beyond the
levels achieved with the prior art copolymers is solvent
resistance, as manifested for instance by resistance to
crazing upon exposure to solvents, motor fuels, and the
like.A shortcoming of certain other known polycarbonatesiloxane
copolymers is the presence of an aryloxysilicon
linkage, which is hydrolysis prone.In copending application, EP-A-0 522 752
are disclosed condensation polymers
which are terpolymers having aliphatic polyester,
polysiloxane and polycarbonate segments (blocks). In
comparison with the prior art, these polymers exhibit
advantageous melt flows, advantageous low temperature
properties and resistance to solvents, chemicals, and to
hydrolysis.It has now been discovered that, if such terpolymers
are prepared, but instead of aliphatic polyester segments,
aromatic polyester segments are employed, commercially
important and unexpected additional advantages are
obtained.The new polymers of this invention are terpolymers
having aromatic polyester, polysiloxane and
