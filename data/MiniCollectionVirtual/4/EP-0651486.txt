<ABSTRACT>
A cable sealing gland comprises a housing adapted 
to be fitted in an opening in a bulkhead and defining 

a receptacle closed at one end by a silicone rubber 
membrane backed by a rigid plastics material support 

insulator which is apertured to permit the passage 
therethrough of electrical cables or the like which 

are pierced through the membrane. A second support 
insulator is spaced apart from the first-mentioned 

support insulator and the space between the two 
support insulators is adapted to be filled with a 

silicone rubber sealing composition. A by-pass tube 
extends through the two support insulators and enables 

access to be obtained through the gland even after it 
has been sealed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements relating to
cable sealing arrangements and more particularly,
though not exclusively, concerns cable sealing glands
for sealing the passage of electrical conductors,
cables and the like through bulkheads, particularly,
though not exclusively, in aircraft.In the field of aircraft manufacture, electrical
wiring extends to all parts of the aircraft from the
cockpit and many cables and individual electrical
conductors are passed through bulkheads between the
aircraft's fuselage and its wings or its tail, the
cables and/or conductors being grouped together and
passed through orifices formed at selected positions
in the bulkheads. In use, the fuselage of an aircraft
is commonly pressurised whereas the wings and tail are
not and, in order to maintain this pressure
differential, it is necessary to provide appropriate
pressure sealing of the orifices.Cable sealing glands for use in ships and in
buildings are well known which make use of packing
pieces to seal the passage of a relatively small
number of cables having a limited range of sizes 
through bulkheads and the like. However, in an
aircraft, and particularly a technologically
sophisticated computer controlled "fly by wire"
aircraft, the number of cables and electrical
conductors that have to be passed through bulkheads is
legion and there are considerable size differences
between the thinnest of single-core conductors which
have sub-millimetre diameters and larger multiple-conductor
cables. The use of packing pieces in
aircraft applications is thus not practical and the
most commonly used sealing method makes use of an
elastomeric bung through which the respective
cable/conductor bundle is threaded, the bung then
being forced into a receptacle fitted in the bulkhead
and being sealed therein by the liberal application of
a silicone rubber sealing compound which it is hoped
will wick into the interstices between the bundled
cables/conductors so as to provide an effective
pressure seal. However, in practice, this type of
pressure seal tends to leak as not all the gaps in the
seal are reliably filled by the sealing compound.
This problem is accentuated by high-pressure
differentials across the seal and by cyclical
pressurisation and depressurisation in normal use.Another problem with the conventionally used
arrangement is that it relies on a sufficient bundle 
of cables/conductors being passed through the
elastomeric bung in order to produce its best results.
When it is desired to pass only a few small cables
through a

A cable sealing gland (10) for sealing the
passage of one or more electrical cables/conductors

(61) or the like through a bulkhead, the cable sealing
gland (10) comprising a housing (11) defining a

receptacle (13) for a cable sealing compound (19)
sealing one or more cables/conductors (61) or the like

extending through the housing (11); and means for
containing (or at least substantially containing) (12)

the sealing compound (19) in the receptacle (13); the
containing means (12) comprising a wall of resilient

elastomeric material (12) 
characterised in that
 the
wall of resilient elastomeric material (12) is or can

be pierced to allow the passage therethrough of one or
more electrical cables/conductors (61) or the like.
A cable sealing gland (10) as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the wall of resilient elastomeric material

(12) comprises a membrane of elastomeric material (12)
backed by a support member (15) having one or more

apertures (50,51,52) formed therein and defining
locations for the passage of one or more electrical

cables/conductors (61) or the like.
A cable sealing gland (10) as claimed in claim 2,
wherein the support member (15) has a plurality of 

apertures (50,51,52) of different sizes.
A cable sealing gland as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
wherein the membrane of elastomeric material (12) is

thinned at the location(s) (44) thereof which
corresponds to the position(s) of said one or more

apertures (50,51,52) in the support member (15).
A cable sealing gland as claimed in claim 4,
wherein the thinning of the membrane (12) is effected

by provision of one or more concave formations (40,41)
at respective locations (44) of the membrane (12).
A cable sealing gland as claimed in any of claims

silicone rubber material and the support member (15)
comprises a rigid plastics material.
A cable sealing gland as claimed in any of claims
2 to 6 wherein the wall (12) is provided at or

adjacent one end (14) of the housing (11) and a
further support member (17) is provided in the housing

(11) at or adjacent another end (18) thereof, the
spacing between the two said support members (15,17)

defining a chamber (13) within the housing (11) which
is adapted to be filled with sealing compound (19).

wherein the support member (15) which backs the

membrane (12) is fixedly secured in the housing (11)
and the other support member (17) is not.
A cable sealing gland (10) as claimed in claim 7
or 8, and wherein a fill indicator is provided in the

chamber (13) for indicating the level to which sealing
compound (19) should be filled into the chamber (13).
A cable sealing gland (10) as claimed in claim 7
