<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to combusting contaminants 
on foundry sand in a container (13) rotating about an 

axis (A) at a particular angle with a particularly 
placed oxygen-fuel burner (32). As the container (13) 

rotates about the axis (A), the oxygen-fuel burner (32) 
fires a flame and excess oxygen at a particular angle 

to enhance pyrolysis of the contaminants. The amount 
of excess oxygen is such that the resulting off gas 

contains at least 2% oxygen by volume, thus preventing 
or substantially minimizing products of incomplete 

combustion from leaving the container (13). After 
having pyrolyzed the contaminants, the firing of a 

flame and excess oxygen from the oxygen-fuel burner 
(32) may be replaced with oxidant dispersion at the 

bottom of the foundry sand. The resulting off gas from 
the container (13) may be treated in a post combustion 

furnace (7), a flue gas cooling means (8), a filtering 
device (9) and/or a pollutant removing means (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems and processes for
pyrolizing contaminants on foundry sand and combusting
the gas resulting from the pyrolysis.The foundry industry uses sand, such as silica,
chromite or olivine sand, extensively in forming molds
which are suitable for casting molten metals. In
forming the molds, the sand is combined with various
binding agents. Usually, the binding agents employed
are natural binders, such as linseed oil and bentonite,
and chemical binders, such as organic resins. The type
of the binding agents employed is dependent on the
desired molding properties. However, bentonite and
organic resin binders are widely utilized. Most of the
organic resin binders are based on phenolic and
furannic resins that form reticular structures under
the influence of a catalyst together with or without
the application of a moderate temperature.The foundry industry recycles large quantities of
spent sand having binder residues. Most often, the
spent sand is recycled after being subject to a
mechanical/attrition treatment followed by a screening
step. The mechanical/attrition treatment allows to
remove or screen out the binder residues that have been
broken down to extremely fine particles. Such a
treatment, however, also causes the sand grains to
break and erode, thus resulting in removing or
screening out large quantities of the sand with the
binder residues. Typically around 20% of the sand is
lost in such an operation. That is, millions tons of
the sand are disposed worldwide annually as a waste. 
Even though a large quantity of the disposed spent sand
contains bentonite (referred to as "green sand") and
may be harmless to the environment, it is often
combined or mixed with spent sand containing organic
binders due the employment of bentonite and organic
binders for making the different parts of a mold and/or
due to the complexity of the foundry industry's
operation. The disposed spent sand having the organic
binders is normally hazardous to the environment.To avoid the inefficiency and environmental hazard
associated with the above recycling method, several
thermal sand reclamation processes involving a fluid
bed have been proposed. In these processes,
electricity or natural gas is used for auxiliary
heating while air is normally used as a fluidizing
medium and as a means for burning organic residues
present on the sand. These processes are useful for
continuously treating large quantities of sand
containing substantially identical binders and having
substantially identical granulometry.
