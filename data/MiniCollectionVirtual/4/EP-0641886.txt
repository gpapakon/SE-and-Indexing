<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In a production drum for heating rock material and granular recycled asphalt having an inlet and outlet chute for the rock material and the recycled asphalt and a burner at one drum end, a large quantity of granular recycled asphalt is to be heated and added to the new rock material simply and cost-effectively. 2.2 It is thus proposed to arrange the inlet chute for the recycled asphalt at the other drum end remote from the burner, to arrange the outlet chute for the heated recycled asphalt approximately in the middle of the drum, to arrange the inlet chute for the rock material following this towards the burner end of the drum and to arrange the outlet chute for the heated rock material at the burner end of the drum.
