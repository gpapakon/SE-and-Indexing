<ABSTRACT>
In order to simplify a circuit for detecting the level of an operating voltage with respect to a specified working range, a Zener diode is used in which the semiconducting junction is polarised alternately by one voltage or another. Under these conditions, the avalanche voltage of this Zener diode changes. The operating voltage to be monitored is connected to the cathode of this Zener diode. If the monitored operating voltage is higher than the avalanche voltage of this Zener diode, the latter starts conducting alternately. On the other hand, if the operating voltage is outside this range, this diode is either permanently conducting or permanently cut off. The variations resulting from this are detected in order to indicate whether the operating voltage is of the correct kind or not.
