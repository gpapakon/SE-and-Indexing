<ABSTRACT>
An integrated optical arrangement of at least three rib waveguides (11, 12, 13) on a substrate (1), operable as a switch. The third rib waveguide (13), which is used for input coupling of an optical wave, runs between two parallel rib waveguides (11, 12), of which each has a contacted pn- or pin-junction (3). By means of asymmetrical switching of the junctions (3), the optical wave is coupled across into one or other of the two outer waveguides (11, 12). Advantages with respect to conventional directional coupler switch structures are complete symmetry of the two switching conditions, "digital" switching behaviour, increased separation of the output waveguides, lower switching losses, increased manufacturing tolerances, reduced polarisation sensitivity and increased optical bandwidth.
