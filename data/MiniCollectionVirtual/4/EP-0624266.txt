<ABSTRACT>
A control arm arrangement for a road vehicle brake lever (1) comprises a control arm (3) pivotally connected to the brake lever and an anchor bracket (4) for attachment to an underframe part (2) of the vehicle. Facing ends of the control arm and the anchor bracket are provided with flanges (10, 11), so that the closely cooperating ends are U-shaped in cross section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control arm arrangement 
for a road vehicle brake lever, comprising a 
control arm pivotally connected to the brake lever and 
an anchor bracket for attachment to an underframe part 
of the vehicle. A conventional brake lever for a heavy road 
vehicle is mounted on an S-cam shaft of a drum brake 
and is connected to a brake cylinder, as is well known 
in the art. It contains an automatic slack adjuster, 
which for its function needs a control signal, provided 
by a control arm connected to a fix-point on the 
vehicle, normally by means of an anchor bracket. Conventionally, the control arm and the anchor 
bracket are connected by means of a screw-joint, 
containing a washer and possibly a wear-reducing 
plastic insert. At mounting the corresponding holes in 
the two parts have to be aligned and the screw-joint 
(screw and nut) securely fastened. Due to vibrations 
and mutual movements it is difficult to obviate wear 
and noise. The screw-joint may also give difficulties 
at later dismounting. A control arm arrangement for a brake 
lever according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from 
US-A-4 440 268. Another possibility is to provide the anchor 
bracket with a slot for cooperation with a suitably 
shaped end of the control arm. The cooperating contact 
surfaces are small, which means that the problem with 
wear is not obviated, even if the mounting difficulties 
are decreased. A far better solution is according to the invention 
attained in that facing ends of the control arm 
and the anchor bracket are provided with flanges, so 
that the closely cooperating ends are U-shaped in 
cross-section.  
 The arrangement is extremely easy to mount and 
dismount, there are no connection means and the contact 
area between the cooperating parts is very large, which 
means that the wear will be minimal, even if the 
arrangement is subjected to vibrations and big forces. The invention will be described in further detail 
below reference being made to the accompanying drawing, 
in which Fig 1 is a side view of a road vehicle 
automatic brake lever with a control arm arrangement 
according to the invention, Fig 2 is an end view of the 
same arrangement, whereas Figs 3 and 4 to a larger 
scale and in views corresponding to those according to 
Figs 1 and 2, respectively, show the two parts relevant 
to the invention. A conventional brake lever containing an automatic 
slack adjuster has the numeral 1. As is well known in 
the art and accordingly not shown, such a lever is 
mounted on an
