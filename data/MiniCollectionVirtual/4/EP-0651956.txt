<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a furniture kit based on a modular wooden framework that can be expanded as desired and takes shelves, sides, backs and bottoms at will. It is easy to assemble and erect and the methods of manufacturing it are very economical. The sleeve nut (1) into which are screwed the return members on the ends of the main crosspieces is inserted during manufacture through the orifice (2) of equal diameter formed horizontally at any desired height in the post and at the location where one of said crosspieces is fitted. It is locked in position by pinning it internally at right angles to the sleeve nut. Pinning is achieved on the one hand, and in the longitudinal direction of the post, - either by means of two pins (3) which have been previously placed inside the orifice (4) at right angles to the sleeve and are then forced laterally outwards by the wedge action of a bevel-ended metal rod (5) inserted into the tapped hole (6) of the sleeve so as to anchor them in the interior of the post - or by means of a threaded rod (7) which is introduced through a longitudinal hole commencing at the end of the post at its extremity and is screwed into the hole (4) which is tapped for this purpose; and on the other hand, pinning is achieved at right angles to the post by a pin with tapped ends into which can be screwed the said return screws and which is thus locked by a set screw screwed into the tapped hole of the sleeve nut. The furniture according to the invention covers all modular furniture provided in self-assembly form and taking up the minimum of space during both storage and transport.
