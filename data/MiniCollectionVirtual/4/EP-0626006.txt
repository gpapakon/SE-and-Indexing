<ABSTRACT>
Wetting, washing and/or cleaning anionic tenside salts are produced by reacting inorganic and/or organic bases with the corresponding anionic tenside precursors which contain hydrophilic, negatively charged groups bound to hydrophobic hydrocarbon residues, in the framework of a spray neutralization during which the anionic tenside precursors in sprayable form are finely sprayed in a gas phase, made to react with the bases and preferably at least partially dried. Spray neutralization is carried out in overheated steam as a protective gas phase.

A process for the production of wetting-, washing-and/or 

cleaning-active anionic surfactant salts by reaction 
of inorganic and/or organic bases with the associated 

anionic surfactant intermediates, which contain hydrophilic 
negatively charged groups attached to hydrophobic hydrocarbon 

radicals, in the course of spray neutralization, in 
which the anionic surfactant intermediates in the form of 

a sprayable formulation are finely sprayed into a gas phase 
and, at the same time, reacted with the bases and, preferably, 

at least partly dried, characterized in that the 
spray neutralization is carried out in superheated steam as 

the inert gas phase. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the interfacially active anionic surfactant salts formed

metals, ammonia and/or organic ammonium compounds. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized

atoms, which preferably contain sodium, potassium, ammonium 

and/or organically substituted ammonium as cations and

sulfonates and/or sulfate. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized

and/or suspensions, preferably in the form of corresponding 
aqueous preparations. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized

subsequent drying with the superheated steam, if desired 

with simultaneous and/or subsequent granulation. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that a substantially dust-free pourable and free-flowing

auxiliaries and/or useful materials and/or by regulation of 

the residual water content. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that, in a multistage process, spray neutralization and 

at least substantial spray drying to form a free-flowing 
powder are carried out in a first step and the powder thus 

formed is subsequently agglomerated into agglomerates of  
 

relatively large particle diameter, the agglomeration step
