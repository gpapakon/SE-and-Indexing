<ABSTRACT>
There is proposed a gas burner in which nozzle pipes 21 are branched off concentrically from a gas supply pipe 2 which is arranged centrally in a burner pipe 4 and around which flows the combustion air 7, the said nozzle pipes being received, distributed uniformly over the periphery, in a common baffle plate or a baffle ring 3. The nozzle pipes 21 each have, seen in the flow direction directly downstream of the baffle ring 3, primary bores 22 and at their closed end 23 obliquely outwardly directed secondary bores 24. For air guidance to the secondary bores 24, there is provided centrally between the nozzle pipes 21 an adjustable air-guiding cone 5 which directs the air outwards towards the burner pipe 4 produced at its end 41.
