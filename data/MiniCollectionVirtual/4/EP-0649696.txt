<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method for classifying electro-discharge 
machining wave patterns by using a delay circuit, and 

a method for preventing arcs by classifying the electro-discharge 
machining waves. The voltage or current waves which are generated 

during an electro-discharge machining operation are classified 
by using high and low reference levels. Then the signals are 

delayed, inverted and AND-logic-combined to obtain a monitoring 
signal. The voltag
e or current waves are sampled immediately 
before the off-state of the delayed and inverted pulse, thereby 

classifying the electro-discharge machining waves. Thus the 
voltage or current waves which are generated during an electro-discharge 

machining operation are classified. Then, by utilizing 
the result of the classification, the occurrence of arcs is 

prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for classifying 
electro-discharge machining wave patterns by utilizing a delay 
circuit, and also relates to a method for preventing arcs based 
on the classification of the electro-discharge machining wave 
patterns in an electro-discharge machining apparatus. That is, 
the patterns of the voltage or current waves which are generated 
during an electro-discharge machining (EDM) are classified by 
utilizing a delay circuit. According to the classifying method, 
the generation of harmful or non-harmful waves is monitored. Conventionally, there have been disclosed a number of the 
wave pattern classifying methods for the purpose of monitoring 
the generations of harmful or non-harmful waves. As the principal approaches for monitoring the state of the 
electro-discharge machining, there are methods such as: 
analyzing the radio frequency generated during the discharge  
 
sparking; measuring and analyzing the electric resistance 
between the electrode and the object to be machine; and 
analyzing the discharge wave patterns. Among them, the most 
preferred was the method of analyzing the wave patterns. The studies on the analysis of the electro-discharge 
machining wave patterns which have been carried out so far can 
be summarized as follows. That is, the following persons studied on the electro-discharge 
machining wave patterns: R. Snoeys (CIRP vol 24, 
1974), S Bhattacharyya (ASME J. of Eng. Ind., 1980), M. Otto 
(ISEM7, 1983), A. Endel (ISEM7, 1983), S. Pandit (ASME J. of 
Eng. Ind., 1984), D. Dauw (CIRP vol 35, 1986), S. Pandit, ASME 
J. of Eng. Ind., 1987), and C. Cogun (ASME PED vol 34, 1988). The contents of the conventional studies are different from 
the first object of the present invention in one point. That is, 
there is a difference in the sampling method. In the 
conventional studies, there is never found the sampling method 
of the present invention. In order to clarify this point, the 
known facts about the discharge wave patterns which occur during 
an electro-discharge machining operation will be briefly 
described. Generally, during a transistorized pulsed electro-discharge 
machining (to be called "electro-discharge machining" below),  
 
5 types of voltage or current wave patterns (voltage = current 
x resistance) are generated in a random manner. That is, waves 
of the normal or effective discharge, arc, short, open and semi-normal 
discharge (the last one being of the present invention) 
are generated (refer to Figure 1). Of them, only the
