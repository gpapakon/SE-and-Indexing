<ABSTRACT>
A hair treatment agent which contains a combination of (A) 0.2 to 10.0 wt % of at least one C12 to C20 fatty alcohol oxethylated with 1 to 6 mol ethylene oxide, (B) 0.2 to 10.0 wt % of at least one glyceryl fatty acid ester of a fatty acid with 12 to 20 carbon atoms oxethylated with at least 4 to 10 mol ethylene oxide, (C) 0.01 to 3.0 wt % of at least one cationic cellulose derivative, (D) 0.01 to 2.0 wt % of at least one water-soluble, physiologically acceptable organic acid with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, (E) 1.0 to 40.0 wt % ethanol and/or isopropanol and (F) 50 to 80 wt % water, and is free from cationic tensides. The novel hair treatment agent has very good conditioning properties, gives the hair a good combability and a good fixing and, owing to the absence of cationic tensides, is more easily biologically degradable.
