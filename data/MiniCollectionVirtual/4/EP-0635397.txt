<ABSTRACT>
The luggage carrier (roofrack) usable on the roof of an automotive (motor) vehicle, comprises two rails (10) fixed flat on the roof and at least two cross-pieces (12), the ends of which can slide on the rails and be locked thereon. The two cross-pieces (12) comprise opposing faces which can be applied directly against one another so as to constitute an aerofoil.

Luggage rack for a motor vehicle, comprising : 

two rails (10) intended to be fixed flat on the 
bodywork of a vehicle, each rail including a longitudinal 

member which exhibits a groove opening upward by means of a 
slot ; and 
at least one crossmember (12) which includes two 
end legs (16), designed so that they can slide on the rails, 

and each equipped with a mechanism for locking on to rails; 
 
   characterized in that the said mechanism includes 

rollers (46) trapped in a groove defined by divergent flanks 
of the respective rail, these rollers being wedged against 

the flanks in a first position of the control member and 
released in a second position. 
Luggage rack according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the control member is made up of a lever (56) which can 

rotate on a base of the leg (16), about an axis orthogonal 
to the longitudinal member (24), between a first position in 

which it is raised by bearing on the base and raises a 
runner for wedging the rollers against the said flanks which 

diverge downward, against the action of resilient means 
(54), and a second position in which it allows the elastic 

means to push down the runner (48) and to wedge the rollers. 
Luggage rack according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the control member is made up of a lever (62) coupled 

to a runner (48) for jamming the rollers, which can be 
rocked manually about an axis parallel to the rail, against 

the action of resilient means, starting from a position in 
which the said elastic means give rise to the wedging of the 

rollers (46), into a position in which the runner (48) 
releases the rollers. 
Luggage rack according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the lever is placed so as to be retracted into the bulk 

of the leg, when it is in the locking position. 
Luggage rack according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the part of each crossmember which is situated outside  

 
of the legs constitutes a bar (14) into which the legs are 

fitted, encased by a cover (44). 
Luggage rack according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises two of the said crossmembers (12), which 

include faces facing each other which can be applied 
directly against one another, at least over the most part of 

their length, so that the crossmembers constitute a single 
wing.
