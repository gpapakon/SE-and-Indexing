<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for separating fine 
solids from water in the used water recovery system of 

a sheet forming mill, wherein the used water recovery 
system includes at least one stage in which an alkaline 

earth metal carbonate is precipitated in the aqueous 
suspension constituting the used water whereby the 

particulate material present in the used water becomes 
entrained in the alkaline earth metal carbonate 

precipitate. By the invention it is possible to 
recover the water and the fine solid materials which 

pass through the wire mesh belt of a paper or board 
forming machine, and optionally recycle those recovered 

materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method for
recovering the water and the fine solid materials which
pass through the wire mesh belt of a paper or board
forming machine.Sheet cellulosic products, for example paper and
board, are generally manufactured on machines of the
type in which a dilute suspension of finely divided
solid materials in water is spread evenly over the
surface of a moving wire mesh belt, which is generally
referred to in the art as the "wire", and water is
drawn through the wire by gravity and by suction to
leave a thin felt-like mat of the solid materials on
the wire. When the web of sheet material formed in
this way is partially dewatered it is transferred from
the wire to a moving felt band which provides it with
support while further dewatering is carried out.The solid material used in the formation of paper
and board products generally consists predominantly of
fibres which are most commonly of cellulose, but which
may contain a proportion of synthetic fibres. The
fibrous material may be prepared, for example, by
subjecting wood to a series of mechanical and/or
chemical processes which separate the fibres
substantially one from another and make them available
for the sheet forming process in lengths ranging from
about 10µm to several millimetres. The solid material
will often also include a particulate mineral material
as a filler, the particles ranging in size from a
fraction of a micrometer to about 50µm.In order to manufacture a sheet material of
homogeneous composition and uniform thickness, it is
generally necessary to apply the solid material to the
wire of the paper machine in the form of a very dilute
aqueous suspension containing from about 0.5% to 1.0%
by weight of solid material. This means that a very 
large quantity of water is required for the manufacture
of paper and board; in fact the weight required is
approximately two hundred times the weight of solid
material used. It is therefore essential in most cases
for environmental and economic reasons that as much as
possible of the water which passes through the wire or
is removed from the web of sheet material at a later
stage is recovered for further use.The water passing through the wire generally
carries with it a substantial amount of fibrous or
particulate material which is too fine to be retained
by the mat of sheet material formed on the wire. This
solid material is generally referred to as "fines". A
useful definition of this term is given in the TAPPI
Standard No. T 261 cm-90 "Fines fraction of paper
