<ABSTRACT>
An improved method is proposed for the preparation of a 
strontium-substituted or unsubstituted lanthanum manganite 

powder by the calcination of a composite carbonate of the respective 
metallic elements formed by mixing an aqueous solution of a 

water-soluble carbonate and an aqueous solution of inorganic 
salts, e.g., nitrates, of the respective metallic elements. Different 

from conventional procedures in which the aqueous carbonate solution 
is added to the aqueous nitrate solution of the metallic elements, 

an unexpected improvement can be obtained in the particle 
size distribution and particle configuration of the precipitated carbonate 

and hence of the manganite powder when the aqueous solution 
of the nitrates of the respective metallic elements is added to 

the aqueous carbonate solution while maintaining the pH of the 
precipitation medium in the range from 7 to 9.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of a lanthanum manganite powder. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a method for the preparation of a powder of lanthanum 
manganite with optional substitution of strontium for a 
part of lanthanum obtained by the precipitation of a composite carbonate 
of the elements followed by the calcination of the precipitates 
into an oxide powder and suitable for use as a base material 
of various kinds of catalysts, electrodes and the like. As is known, lanthanum manganite or lanthanum-strontium 
composite manganite in the form of a powder is a material useful 
as a base material of various kinds of catalysts, electrodes and the 
like and is prepared conventionally by a process in which powders 
of lanthanum oxide, manganese carbonate and, optionally, strontium 
carbonate taken each in a specified amount are blended together 
as uniformly as possible either as dry or as wetted and the 
powder blend is calcined at a high temperature of 1200 Â°C or 
higher. This calcination method of a powder blend, however, has a 
problem that it is a very difficult matter to achieve complete conversion 
of the powder blend into a composite oxide of lanthanum 
manganite leaving a substantial amounts of the starting oxide 
and/or carbonates unreacted even by almost impracticably extending  
 
the calcination time or by further increasing the calcination 
temperature. When a lanthanum manganite powder containing a 
substantial amount of unreacted lanthanum oxide as one of the 
starting materials is used as a material for the preparation of a 
sintered body, a great adverse influence is caused on the mechanical 
strength of the sintered body or in the electric properties of the 
sintered body used as an electrode. When the composite oxide of 
lanthanum manganite is to be used in the form of a powder as 
such, furthermore, coarsening of the particles is an unavoidable 
consequence of the calcination process performed at a so high temperature 
for a so long time. Accordingly, the coarsened particles in 
most cases must be subjected to an additional fine pulverization 
treatment necessarily resulting in a great increase in the production 
cost of the lanthanum manganite powder. Japanese Patent Kokai 4-74721 proposes an alternative 
method to the above described calcination method of a powder 
blend for the preparation of a strontium-substituted lanthanum 
manganite powder, according to which an aqueous solution of ammonium 
carbonate is added to an aqueous
