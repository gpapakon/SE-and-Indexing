<ABSTRACT>
A rotor position encoder for an electric motor 
comprises a disc member (18) mounted to rotate with 

the rotor shaft. The encoder has a set of radially 
extending features formed with angularly evenly spaced 

leading edges and unevenly spaced trailing edges. The 
leading edges induce a signal in a sensor (16) that 

corresponds to the relative timing of power switches for 
each motor phase. The trailing edges define a cyclical 

code by which motor controlling circuitry is able to 
determine the phase of rotation of the rotor and thus 

establish the correct power switch actuation sequence. 
An electric motor control system and methods of starting 

electric motors are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control system and method for 
electric machines, using an encoder from which the 
position of the rotor relative to the stator is 
derivable. The invention is particularly, though not 
exclusively, applicable to switched reluctance (SR) 
machines. The switched reluctance drive is a variable-speed drive 
system comprising a switched reluctance motor supplied 
from a power-electronic converter under the control of 
low-power control electronics. The motor has salient 
poles on both the stator and the rotor, typically with an 
excitation coil around each stator pole. These stator 
coils are grouped to form one or more phase windings. 
The electrical currents in the windings are typically 
switched on and off by power-electronic switches. The timing of the switching of the currents in the 
windings is controlled in relation to the relative 
angular position of the stator and rotor poles. This 
relative position may be detected by a rotor position 
transducer which consists of a rotating member and 
stationary sensors which supply signals to the control 
electronics. In single and two-phase systems only a 
single sensor is required, but motors with more than two 
phases generally use more than one sensor according to 
the prior art. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a typical 3-phase 
SR motor, which has six stator poles and four rotor 
poles. The poles carrying coils A and A' have opposite 
magnetic polarisation. Phases B and C are formed  
 
similarly. A rotor position transducer (RPT) is used to ensure that 
the currents of the phase windings are switched on and 
off at the appropriate angles of rotation. Figure 2a 
illustrates a typical system consisting of a rotating 
slotted disc and three optical sensors which are switched 
by the rotation of the disc. Figure 2b shows the idealised variation of the 
inductances of the phase windings as functions of angle 
of rotation . Positive torque is defined as that which 
acts in the direction to move the rotor in the direction 
of positively increasing . Such torque is produced by 
any phase when the winding of that phase carries current 
and the angle of rotation is such that the inductance is 
increasing with increasing . Negative torque is 
produced when a phase carries current during that part of 
its inductance cycle where the inductance is decreasing 
with increasing  (or increasing with decreasing ). It will be apparent therefore that for normal positive 
torque operation in the direction of increasing  (the 
forward
