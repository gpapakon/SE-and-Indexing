<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for regeneration of
used solid superacid catalysts by heating the catalyst and
exposing the heated catalyst to a gas stream comprising air
and sulfur dioxide. This method finds particular use in the
regeneration of sulfated and calcined solid superacid
catalysts.The ability to regenerate sulfated and calcined solid
superacid catalyst in an efficient manner is an important goal
of catalysis research. Solid super acid catalysts, such as
those disclosed in Hollstein et al. U.S. Patent 4,918,041 and
Hollstein et al. U.S. Patent 4,956,519, are useful in the
alkylation and isomerization of normal alkanes to produce high
octane number blending components for motor fuels and/or
valuable chemical intermediates. The conventional method for the regeneration of catalyst
activity involves heating the catalyst in a stream of gas
containing a controlled amount of oxygen. The regeneration
temperature is maintained such that it is high enough to burn
off the carbonaceous deposits accumulated on the used
catalyst, yet low enough not to melt or otherwise physically
damage the catalyst itself.At a given temperature and pressure, the concentration of
oxygen is inversely related to the generation of carbon
monoxide. Because the oxygen concentration is limited during
catalyst regeneration, carbon monoxide is formed in the gas
stream. Carbon monoxide can reduce the sulfate groups or the
metal oxides of the catalyst. Because those groups are
believed to be active sites of the catalyst, their reduction
by CO reduces the activity of the catalyst. Higher
temperatures, which would favor the production of carbon
dioxide over carbon monoxide and thereby minimize reduction of
catalyst sites, could physically damage the catalyst or the
reactor vessel. The process of the present invention solves this problem
involving the regeneration of sulfated catalysts by heating
the catalyst in a gas stream comprising air and sulfur
dioxide. The sulfur dioxide is believed to form an
equilibrated mixture of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur
trioxide (SO3) which serve to reactivate sulfate sites on the
catalyst which were reduced by carbon monoxide in the gas
stream. This presence of sulfur dioxide in the gas stream,
therefore, allows the regeneration reaction to be run at a
considerably lower temperature than conventional processes,
minimizing catalyst damage.The present invention comprises a method for the
regeneration of used sulfated catalysts and particularly
sulfated and calcined solid superacid catalysts. It is
