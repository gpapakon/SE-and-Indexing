<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a vehicle brake and hub (2) comprising a ring braking member (4) having cylindrical braking surfaces (6, 8) both to the interior and exterior of the member in combination with a hub (14). The hub includes fan blades (22) which cause, during rotation of the hub (14), an axial flow of air to move through and to extract heat from the fan blades (22). A shield (50) is provided immediately adjacent and spaced from the interior braking surface (6) to separate the braking surface from the air flow. Heat energy is transferred principally by radiation to the shield (50) from braking surface (6), which heat energy is subsequently transferred to the air flow. The shield (50) protects the braking surface (6) from dirt, water or other contaminates which could reduce the effectiveness of the interior braking surface (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle brake 
and in particular to a vehicle brake having 
associated therewith an air flow for removing heat from the 
brake. There are a host of different braking arrangements 
for vehicles which have been proposed, with the most 
popular braking system being either the Drum Brake or more 
recently the Disk Brake. In addition to these two types of 
braking systems there is also what is referred to as a Ring 
Brake, as generally shown in United States Patent 3,170,542 
and Canadian Patent 1,271,432, where braking can occur on 
both sides of the ring brake member. U.K. Publication No. 2 046 380 A discloses a ring 
brake with a cover across one end of the ring brake. Common to all of these braking systems is the 
dissipation of energy by means of heat which is generated 
at or on the braking surface. This heat is dissipated to 
the surrounding air environment by means of convection, 
however, due to the placement of the brake, generally in a 
confined region under a vehicle, the circulation of air is 
relatively poor and the convection coefficient of heat 
transfer is relatively low. This problem of heat build-up 
is particularly acute where the brake must be operated 
frequently over a long period of time and thus, the braking 
system does not have an opportunity to dissipate the heat 
when the brake is not in use. Such circumstances commonly 
occur with truck braking systems, particularly in 
mountainess regions, and the possibility of brake failure 
is quite acute. For example, there are often run-off 
regions where vehicles that are out of control (i.e. where 
braking system is substantially lost) may exit into these 
regions which are designed to stop the vehicle.  
 Most conventional car braking systems operate 
satisfactorily, however, braking systems used to maximum, 
say eight times in a row, result in the effective braking 
power to be less than 50%. The principle reason for the 
reduction in braking power is heat build-up within the 
braking system. Another problem associated with vehicle braking 
systems is in the transmission of the heat generated in the 
braking system to the wheel bearing of the vehicle. Wheel 
bearings have generally been protected from transfer of 
heat from the braking system, as the life of the wheel 
bearing would be substantially reduced if exposed to the 
heat generated in the braking system. Therefore, the prior 
practice has been to isolate the wheel bearing from a 
direct heat transfer path of the braking surface to the 
wheel
