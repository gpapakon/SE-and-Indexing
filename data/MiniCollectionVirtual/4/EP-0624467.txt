<ABSTRACT>
A sheet transferring apparatus transfers a sheet (Pa) 
between a plurality of printing units (1, 2). Multiple 

color press on a single surface of the sheet and a single 
color press on both surfaces of the sheet are selectively 

performed. A feed cylinder (13) is rotatably provided 
between the adjacent units. A power source (69) actuates 

the feed cylinder. A first rotating member (35) is 
mechanically connected to the power source. A second 

rotating member (34) is mechanically connected to the feed 
cylinder (13). The second member (34) is arranged to be 

driven by the first member (35). A phase adjusting 
mechanism (36) automatically adjusts a phase between the 

first and second members in accordance with the multiple 
color press and the single color press.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet transferring apparatus for
transferring a sheet between a plurality of printing units wherein multiple
color press on a single surface of the sheet and a single color press on both
surfaces of the sheet are selectively performed, comprising a feed cylinder
rotatably provided between the adjacent units, a power source for actuating
the feed cylinder, a power transmission mechanism provided between the
feed cylinder and the power source, said power transmission mechanism
including a drive gear mechanically connected to the power source, a driven
gear mechanically connected to the feed cylinder and a decelerator operably
connected to the drive gear and to the driven gear and being connectable to
a motor via a rotary shaft for adjusting the phase between the gears.Printed matters including pamphlets and catalogs are often printed using
offset presses. The offset press is capable of multi-color printing and also
well suited for mass printing. Sheet-fed printers, to which printing paper
sheets of the same size are fed one by one to carry out offset printing, are
widely employed. Such type of sheet-fed offset press is provided with a pair
of impression cylinders 220, with a supply cylinder 223 being interposed
therebetween via first and second feed cylinders 221,222, as shown in Fig.
24. The supply cylinder 223 has a diameter twice as great as those of the
other cylinders 220,221,222.In a mode where printing is to be applied on both surfaces of the paper Pa
(double-surface printing mode or a single color press mode), the papers Pa
retained on the right impression cylinder 220 is first printed on the top side
by a right blanket cylinder 224a. The thus printed papers Pa retained on the
supply cylinder 223 is fed through the 
first feed cylinder 221 to the supply cylinder 223 with the
printed surface facing outward and then grasped at the
front edge by grippers 230. The paper Pa is then grasped
at the rear edge by a plurality of holders 225 arranged in
the axial direction of the second feed cylinder 222. The
paper Pa is fed further to the second feed cylinder 222
with the printed surface still facing outward to be turned
over onto the left impression cylinder 220 and printed on
the back side by a left blanket cylinder 224b.In the sheet-fed printer having such reversing mechanism,
when the printing paper is to be replaced with sheets of a
different size, the locations of the front segment 223a and
the rear segment 223b relative to the supply cylinder 223,
i.e. the angle
