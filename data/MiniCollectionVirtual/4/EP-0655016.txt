<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of a 
spray of atomized particles and subsequently to 
imparting direction to the spray, and might find 
application in the production of either a layer or 
coating on a substrate, billet, tube or irregular 
section article. The usual procedure is to atomize a stream of 
liquid by means of a high pressure gas to form a stream 
of atomized droplets that is directed onto a substrate 
or former, but it is also possible, especially with 
metals, to use wire or powder as the feedstock for 
producing a stream of droplets. A wide range of such processes and materials 
have been proposed, but the process has been applied 
particularly advantageously to the sprayforming of 
metals. This process was devised in 1968 and has the 
capability of making a wide range of semi-finished 
products having improved properties. The products 
comprise plate, sheet and strip e.g. of high silicon 
steel, hollow and solid billets, tubes and rings as 
well as laminated products and matrix composites. In 
order to produce the particular shapes required it is 
usually necessary to move the substrate or former in an 
appropriate manner and at the same time to deflect the 
stream of atomized particles. The latter procedure is 
particularly important in ensuring that the process is 
operated with the highest efficiency with the lowest 
possible overspray and that the product is as near as 
possible to the final shape required. We have found that the most efficient and 
reliable way of deflecting the stream of atomized 
particles is by pneumatic means i.e. using a secondary 
stream or streams of gas, usually inert gas, to deflect 
the primary atomized spray causing it to assume the  
 
required position. This procedure is herein referred to 
as 'scanning'. Ways of carrying out this procedure are 
described in GB 1455862 and GB 2129249. Turning firstly to the external programming 
of pneumatic scanning atomizers embodying rotary valves 
for programming. The function of pneumatic scanning atomizers 
generally is to vary gas flow cyclically through a set 
of fixed scanning nozzles facing in a direction 
inclined downward and towards the axis of a metal 
stream contained within a stream of gas, known as the 
atomizing gas. Deflection can occur before, during or 
after atomization. In practical pneumatic scanning 
atomizers the angle of deflection is often varied 
during each cycle by restricting the flow of deflecting 
(or scanning) gas to a degree depending on the position 
of the rotor of a rotary

<CLAIMS>
Scanning apparatus for scanning a stream of atomised 
particles in a pre-determined manner, the apparatus 

comprising a rotary pneumatic valve (20) comprising routing 
through which gas is arranged to be routed to one or more 

nozzles (14) to impart a scanning action to the stream of 
atomised particles, the amount of gas supplied to the 

nozzle or nozzles (14) varying cyclically in a pre-determined 
manner as the rotor (23) of the valve (20) 

rotates; characterised in that the configuration of the 
routing comprising the rotary pneumatic valve (20) is 

externally adjustable and externally programmable to be 
displaced between a first configuration and a second 

configuration comprising the same routing, in order to 
alter the pre-determined cyclical flow of gas to the nozzle 

or nozzles. 
Scanning apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising 
control means comprising electronic means operating through 

a displacement transducer to effect adjustment of the 
routing.  

 
Scanning apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the 
control means comprises means for adjusting stepwise the 

control exercised by the valve. 
Scanning apparatus according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the rotary valve comprises a stator (28,29,30) 

having a pair of angularly spaced timing elements (28a,28b; 
29a,29b; 30a,30b) which operate respectively to open and 

close off the supply of gas to the nozzle or set of nozzles 
(14) through a port (32,33) in a rotary member (23), the 

rotational positions of the two timing elements relative to 
the port being adjustable. 
Scanning apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the 
rotational positions of the two timing elements are 

adjustable so as to remain equi-angularly disposed about 
said port.
