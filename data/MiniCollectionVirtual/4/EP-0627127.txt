<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a cartridge capable of accommodating either a
first or a second energy source. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a
cartridge capable of accommodating either an energy pack or a plurality of individual
battery cells. The cartridge can be securable to an electrical apparatus, or integral therewith.The present invention finds particular utility when used in conjunction with a
portable electrical apparatus, such as a video camcorder, a cellular telephone, a computer, a
toy or the like.An energy pack is a rechargeable energy storage device capable of storing energy
for use by an electrical apparatus. Energy packs for use with video camcorders are well
known in the art. For example, the Sony Corporation markets an energy pack under the
tradename NP-55 for supplying energy to a Sony 8mm video camcorder. Additionally,
Panasonic, a division of Matsushita Electric Corporation of America, markets an energy
pack under the tradename PV-BP15 for supplying energy to a Panasonic VHS video
camcorder.The energy packs are secured to their respective video camcorders in slightly
different ways. Additionally, the contact points which electrically connect the energy packs
to their respecve video camcorders are positioned at different locations with respect to the
two energy packs. Thus, the Sony NP-55 energy pack will not fit on or electrically
connect to the Panasonic VHS video camcorder and the Panasonic PV-BP15 energy pack
will not fit on or electrically connect to the Sony 8mm video camcorder.Both the NP-55 and the PV-BP15 are rechargeable energy packs which, when fully
charged, provide their respective camcorder with a nominal 6 volt direct current (d.c.) 
energy source. Under normal operating conditions, a camcorder can operate several hours
on a fully charged energy pack. In order to fully restore the charge, the energy pack must
be placed in a recharger.If the user desires to operate the camcorder after the energy pack has run too low
for camcorder operation but before the energy pack has been recharged, the user must
possess either a spare energy pack, an AC line converter or a separate cartridge attachable
to the camcorder in which individual battery cells are placed. The cartridge is attachable to
the camcorder in place of an energy pack and must be removed when reattaching the energy
pack. It is not uncommon, however, for the user to have forgotten to bring the spare
energy pack, the AC line converter and/or the battery cell cartridge, if indeed these

<CLAIMS>
A cartridge (100) capable of accommodating at one
time either a rechargeable energy pack (114) or one or

more individual battery cells (116) to supply energy to
an electrical apparatus having a positive contact (602 or

702) and a negative contact (604 or 704) wherein said
battery cells (116) are each individually separable from

the cartridge (100) and from each other, said cartridge
(100) comprising:


a housing (102, 104, 106, 108, 110) having a cavity
(112) capable of accommodating at one time either an

energy pack (114) or at least one individual battery cell
(116);
a first set of contacts (502 and 504) exposed from
the exterior of said housing (102, 104, 106, 108, 110),

the position of said first set of contacts (502 and 504)
corresponding to the position of the positive contact (602

or 702) and negative contact (604 or 704) of the
electrical apparatus;
a second set of contacts (124 and 130) located within
the cavity (112), the position of said second set of

contacts (124 and 130) corresponding to the position of
a positive contact and a negative contact of the energy

pack (114) locatable within the cavity (112);
a plurality of a third set of contacts (132 and 134)
located within the cavity (112) so that at least one

individual battery cell (116) can be located therein such
that a positive and a negative contact on an individual

battery cell can mate with one of the third set of
contacts (132 and 134);

characterised in that the cartridge comprises a fourth set
of contacts (126 and 128) located within the cavity (112),

the position of said fourth set of contacts (126 and 128) 
corresponding to the position of a positive contact and

a negative contact of a second rechargeable energy pack
(114) different to said first energy pack (114), wherein

said second (124 and 130), third (132 and 134), and fourth
(126 and 128) sets of contacts are all electrically

connected to said first set of contacts (502 and 504).
The cartridge as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that it comprises a device (118) for retaining the

energy pack (114) or individual battery cell(s) (116)
within the cavity (112).
The cartridge as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that said cartridge (100) further

comprises means for recharging an energy pack (114)
located in the cavity (112).
The cartridge as claimed in claim 3, characterised
in that a user-activated switch (1106) is provided to

indicate whether non-rechargeable or rechargeable cells
are in the cartridge (100).
The cartridge as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the battery cell(s) (116)

capable of being housed within the cavity (112) are non-rechargeable.
The cartridge as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the cartridge further

comprises a locking mechanism (120) for securely
positioning said housing (102, 104, 106, 108, 110) to the

electrical apparatus.
A cartridge as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a rechargeable energy pack 

(114) or one or more individual battery cells (116) is
mounted in said cavity (112) with the positive and

negative contacts of said rechargeable energy pack (114)
or of said battery cell(s) (116) in electrical contact

with said second contacts (124 and 130 or 126 and 128) or
said third contacts (132 and 134) respectively.
