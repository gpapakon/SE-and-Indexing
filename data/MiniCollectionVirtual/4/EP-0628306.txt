<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an intraocular 
irrigating composition containing a compound of the 

following formula or a pharmacologically acceptable 
salt thereof 


wherein R₁ and R₂ are the same or different and each 
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. 
The glutathione derivative contained in the 
intraocular irrigating solution of this invention is 

not only effective in protecting the intraocular 
tissues on the occasion of ophthalmic surgery but 

effectively inhibits precipitation of the calcium 
contained. Therefore, the intraocular irrigating 

solution of this invention is very stable and can be 
used with advantage in various kinds of ophthalmic 

surgery such as cataract surgery and transplantation of 
the cornea, iris and vitreous body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a useful intraocular
irrigating solution. More particularly, this invention
relates to a useful intraocular irrigating solution
characterized by containing S-(α ,β
-dicarboxyethyl)glutathione, which is a physiological
substance, or an ester thereof, or a pharmacologically
acceptable salt thereof.With the recent progress and spread of cataract
surgery and other ophthalmic surgery such as
transplantation of the cornea, iris and vitreous body,
there is a need for an intraocular irrigating solution
effective enough to protect the intraocular tissues
against damage during such operations. If the
protection of intraocular tissues during operation is
inadequate and the tissues sustain physiologic damage,
the postoperative course will be unfavorable with an
increased risk of complications such as corneal
opacity, glaucoma and retinitis.Any intraocular irrigating solution desirably
approximates the human aqueous humor in composition but 
so far physiological saline, lactated Ringer's
solution, BSS (balanced salt solution) PLUS (trade
name), etc. have been chiefly utilized for intraocular
irrigation and lavage.However, these intraocular irrigating solutions
are not sufficiently satisfactory for the protection of
intraocular tissues and as far as BSS PLUS is
concerned, it is not as stable as desired. Therefore,
much research is underway for the development of a more
stable, more tissue-protective intraocular irrigating
solution.EP-A-0 501 354 describes in Example 1 an ophthalmic solution
comprising 1.0 g/100 ml of S-(Di-n-butyl-alpha-beta-dicarboxyethyl)glutathione.Meanwhile, according to Kinseg et al., a desirable
intraocular irrigating solution is composed of 8.33 mM
glucose, 1.23 mM calcium, 1.22 mM magnesium and 25 mM
sodium hydrogen carbonate and has a pH value of 7.4.
However, this intraocular irrigating solution has the
disadvantage that the calcium contained therein tends
to precipitate with aging. As inhibitors of
precipitation of calcium, several compounds can be
contemplated but in order that such compounds may occur
in amounts necessary to prevent precipitations as to
inflict damages on the intraocular tissues. Thus,
there is no agent as of today that is able to
effectively prevent precipitation of calcium and yet
keep the intraocular tissues intact and safe. Under the circumstances the inventors of this
invention, who had been studying the pharmacologic
actions of S-(α ,β -dicarboxyethyl)glutathione, which
is a physiological substance occurring comparatively
abundantly in the
