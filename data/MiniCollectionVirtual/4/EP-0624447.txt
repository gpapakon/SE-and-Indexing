<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing synthetic resin 
containers which are excellent in strength, toughness 

and heat insulation and have inner surfaces smooth and 
agreeable to the touch. The method including the steps 

of: (a) forming an inner surface layer component from 
a synthetic resin sheet by thermoforming; (b) fitting the 

inner surface layer component onto a male die; (c) pouring 
a synthetic resin in a melt condition into the inside of a 

female die; (d) fitting the male die onto the female die 
and bringing it close to the female die to compress the 

synthetic resin; (e) injecting compressed air into the 
synthetic resin through at least one air nozzle formed in 

the female die while enlarging a gap between the male 
and female dies so as to correspond to a predetermined 

thickness of a prospective molded product; (f) causing the 
compressed air to press the synthetic resin against entire 

inner surface of the cavity; and (g) cooling the synthetic 
resin to solidify the same and releasing the product from 

the dies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing bathtubs made of synthetic 
resin (hereinafter also referred to as "synthetic resin container(s)") and, more particularly, 
to a method capable of easily manufacturing synthetic resin containers having 
excellent strength and heat insulating characteristics such as wash basin, wash or 
kitchen sink. A method is known from the EP-A-0498444, whereby a hollow article is produced by 
supplying a molten resin between a pair of a fixed and a movable mold before the fixed 
mold and the movable mold are closed. By the help of at least one gas-supplying pin, 
which is provided on a surface of the fixed mold, pressurized gas is supplied in order to 
form a hollow part in a part of the resin. This method relates to a hollow-molded article 
composed of a synthetic resin and an optional skin material, whereby the article is 
used as a back and a seat of a chair or a cold box and the like. This document only 
mentions the use of a skin layer of thermoplastic resin for instance without indicating 
how the skin layer is applied to the hollow article and on which of the inner and outer 
surface it is located.  
 Hitherto, the most prevailing synthetic resin 
containers (bathtubs and sinks) have been 
manufactured by an FRP manufacturing method. 
Specifically, a bathtub or the like is formed of a 
material mainly containing fiberglass reinforced polyester 
resin. The following problems have recently been 
highlighted with regard to bathtubs of such type and the 
like containers. 
(1) The use of glass fiber deleteriously affects the 
working environment. Specifically, glass fiber clings to 
operator's clothing or sticks into operator's skin. 
Further, minute glass fiber fragments are sucked into the 
operator's body together with air breathed in and hence 
cause various health hazards. (2) It is difficult to recycle the material of a product 
since the material is a thermosetting resin and, 
furthermore, glass fiber is used therein. While the recycling of materials of products is 
now being advocated all over the world as a part of the 
environmental protection, ships made of FRP or like 
products present critical problems because of their large 
size. Bathtubs and sinks also face 
these problems inevitably. Nevertheless, the conventional 
bathtubs are not able to cope with such 
problems. It is a long time since a bathtub made by  
 
thermoforming an acrylic resin plate appeared on market. 
Initially, the bathtub of such type was manufactured 
from an acrylic

A method for manufacturing a bathtub (1), comprising the steps of: 

a) pre-forming an inner surface layer component (3,8) comprising a polymethyl 
methacrylate resin sheet (S) by thermoforming onto a mold (7) using a vacuum 

forming method; 
b) fitting the inner surface layer component (8) onto a male die (9); 
c) forming a reinforcing layer (4) by inserting a molten synthetic thermoplastic 
resin (P) into the inside of a female die (10) wherein the female die(10) further 

comprises at least one independently movable portion (23); 
d) fitting the male die (9) onto the female die (10) and bringing the male die (9) and 
the female die (10) close together to compress the reinforcing layer (4) within a 

cavity (13) defined between a back surface of the inner surface layer component 
(8) fitted on the male die (9) and the female die (10); 
e) injecting compressed air into the reinforcing layer (4) through at least one air 
nozzle (12) formed in the female die (10) while enlarging the cavity (13) between 

the male and female dies (9,10) so as to correspond to a predetermined thickness 
of the bathtub (1) thereby forming hollow portions (5) within the reinforcing 

layer (4) and after a lapse of a predetermined time period, moving the independently 
movable portion (23) in a direction so as to enlarge the cavity (13) between 

the male and female dies (9,10) to form a reinforcing rib (6) within the 
hollow portions (5); 
f) causing the compressed air to press the reinforcing layer (4) against the entire 
back surface of the inner surface layer component (8) and the female die (10); 

and 
g) cooling the synthetic resin (P) of the reinforcing layer (4) to solidify the same 
releasing the bathtub (1) from the dies (9,10).
