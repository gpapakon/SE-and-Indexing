<ABSTRACT>
Techniques are disclosed for automatically identifying the locations of 
telephone subscribers (e.g. normally on 190). The location of the telephone 

subscriber is determined so that incoming telephone calls for a given telephone 
subscriber may be directed to a telephone device (e.g. 152) situated near the current 

location of the subscriber. A portable tracking device (100,130) is employed to 
determine the subscriber location. The tracking device includes a memory (104) for 

storing a subscriber identification number uniquely specifying a telephone subscriber 
or a group of telephone subscribers, a transceiver (140) for transmitting and 

receiving radio signals, and a processor, (138), coupled to the memory and to the 
transceiver for selectively activating the transceiver in response to a received radio 

signal (from 150) to transmit a radio signal including the subscriber identification 
number.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to personal communications systems and 
methods, and more particularly to techniques for connecting incoming telephone calls 
intended for a specific individual to a telephone device situated near the current location 
of that individual. In today's fast-paced world, it is often very difficult to reach people by telephone. 
In the workplace, employees may be called upon to perform a variety of duties, with the 
result that these individuals are seldom at their desks, sitting next to the phone. After 
working hours, people may spend a significant amount of time away from home, visiting 
friends and relatives, shopping, or dining out. Although it is possible to initiate a future 
contact with these individuals by leaving a message on an answering device or by 
activating a paging system, it would be much more desirable to speak directly to the 
person without having to wait for the person to answer a page or a voice message. 
Oftentimes, it can be an extremely frustrating experience to make repeated attempts at 
reaching someone, only to be connected with various electronic machines in the form of 
voice mailboxes and automated voice-response paging networks. Various prior art techniques have been developed to address the shortcomings of 
traditional answering machines and pagers. For example, Shigenaga, U.S. Patent No. 
4,852,456, sets forth a telephone system which uses a smart card to activate the telephone 
nearest to the smart card user, so that this telephone will ring upon receipt of an incoming 
call directed to the smart card user. A smart card stores a personal ID number, and the 
card must be inserted into a telephone interface near the smart card user in order to 
activate the call forwarding feature. In this manner, the personal ID number of the smart 
card user is registered and associated with this telephone. Once this ID number has been 
registered, the nearest telephone is automatically connected to any calling telephone on 
which the personal ID number is dialed. Users of the Shigenaga apparatus must tolerate the inconvenience of having to 
insert a smart card into a holder before the call forwarding feature is activated. 
Additionally, the system will continue to forward calls to a given number until the user 
changes his or her telephone registration by inserting the smart card into another 
telephone interface. Users must take the time to report their current location to the 
system; otherwise, the call forwarding system will be rendered
