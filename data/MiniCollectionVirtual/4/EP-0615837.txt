<ABSTRACT>
A method and a press for implementing the method are proposed for controlling the drive of a hydraulic press for forming and/or cutting sheets of metal or the like. In order to propose an innovative way of controlling the drive of such a press, in the case of which special use is made of the principle of secondary control, the different movements of the press ramp (4) and/or of the piston/cylinder unit (5, 6) which drives the press ramp (4) are coordinated with one another, a pressurised network operating in a closed circuit and the maximum system pressure being determined by a pressure reservoir. In this process, the piston of a piston/cylinder unit (5, 6) is clamped on both sides at the highest possible pressure and a force is exerted on the press ramp (4) by virtue of the fact that a specific volume flow is removed in a piston/cylinder unit (5, 6).

Drive control method for a hydraulic press for shaping 
and/or cutting sheet metal or the like, with at least one 

piston/cylinder unit (5, 6) able to be actuated bilaterally for 
driving a press ram (4), the drive piston (9) being acted upon 

by means of a hydraulic medium in the direction of a shifting-away 
of the press ram (4), characterised in that a hydraulic 

storage unit (18) having the maximum working pressure is 
provided, which in a pressure system (17) acts on the piston (9) 

of the piston/cylinder unit (5, 6) on both sides with hydraulic 
medium at the same pressure and that for producing a downwards 

movement of the press ram or a pressing force (P) affecting the 
work-piece, pressure medium is supplied from the lower cylinder 

chamber (10), facing the press ram (4), to a pump (25) (hydraulic 
motor) whereof the angle of traverse is adjustable, so that the 

volumetric flow (V)(42) is controlled and the upper cylinder 
chamber (10') remote from the press ram (4) is likewise acted 

upon by pressure medium from the operating pressure system. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
pressure in the operating pressure system (17) for the upper 

cylinder chamber (10') and the lower cylinder chamber (10) of the 
working cylinder (5, 6) remains constant when there is no load 

on the press ram (4) and that the downwards movement of the press 
ram (4) is controlled by way of the volumetric flow (V)(42) from 

the lower cylinder chamber (10) of the working cylinder (5, 6), 
which is guided by way of the controllable pump (25). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that in the 
case of a counter-load on the press ram (force F) by the work-piece 

to be machined, a pressure reduction occurs in the lower 
cylinder chamber (10) of the working cylinder (5, 6), which takes 

place due to the counterforce (P) on the press ram (4) with a 
simultaneously unreduced volumetric flow (V)(42) due to a 

volumetric flow offtake from the lower cylinder chamber (10) by 
means of the controllable pump (25), in the upper cylinder  

 
chamber (10') of the working cylinder (5, 6), a pressure which 

is higher in comparison with the lower cylinder chamber acting 
with a higher pressing force. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the mechanical drive shaft (27) of the controllable pump 

(25) (hydraulic motor) transmits a torque to the drive shaft 
connected thereto of an in particular electrically driven feed 

pump (26), the feed pump (26) simultaneously serving for 
conveying pressure medium (V)(43) into the upper cylinder chamber 

(10') increasing at the time of the downwards movement of the 
press ram (4). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the volumetric flow (V)(42) of the controllable pump (25) 

and/or the feed pump (26) takes place by means of an adjustment 
of the angle of traverse. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
rapid power traverse of the press ram (4) in its downwards and/or 

upwards movement takes place by way of a separate piston/cylinder 
unit or a rapid power traverse cylinder (7), which comprises a 

driving piston (9) able to be acted upon by pressure medium on 
both sides, the cylinder chambers (10, 10') of the working 

cylinders (5, 6) being hydraulically short-circuited by means of 
a multi-way valve unit (22) during the rapid power traverse. 
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in that during 
the operation of the controllable pump (25), the multi-way valve 

unit (22) is closed in the lower ram region. 
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
control of the multi-way valve unit (22) and/or the control of 

the angle of traverse of the controllable pump (25) takes place 
in a manner coordinated with respect to each other, the control 

of the valve closing lagging behind the control of the opening 
pump (25).  

 
Method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the control of the pressure medium in the 

rapid power traverse cylinder (7) taking place during the 
downwards movement of the press ram (4) by way of a pump (35)

circuit is closed, the pump (35) driving a controllable hydraulic 

motor (37) for the purpose of supplying pressure medium to the 
operating pressure system. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterised in that the 
weight energy of the downwardly moving press ram (4) is recovered 

in the hydraulic motor (37) of the drive unit (13). 
Method according to one of the preceding Claims,

press ram (4) can be ascertained by means of displacement-measuring 
devices (12, 12'), an irregular press ram position 

being able to be ascertained. 
Method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that irregular loading of the press ram (4) by 

the respectively loaded working cylinders (5, 6) is compensated 
for in the way of an additional admission of pressure. 
Method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the piston (9) is hydraulically clamped in  

 
the working cylinders (5, 6) when machining a work-piece, so that 

an uncontrolled penetration of the tool on the work-piece is
