<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a porous metal fiber plate. Such plates,
in which the fibers are sintered to one another, are used, among
other things, as filter media.It is further known from the European patent 0 157 432 to use
these fiber webs as a membrane for radiant surface combustion
burners for gas mixtures, in as far as steel fibers containing Cr
and Al are used to make them resistant against high temperatures.Since the porosity of these non-woven steels fiber webs, fiber
mats or sintered fiber plates is not always perfectly homogenous,
a uniform transverse gas flow over the entire surface of the plate
cannot always be guaranteed. For a number of applications, this
has turned out to be a drawback, e.g. for burner membranes and for
the gas-permeable support plates for fluid bed treatments in which
a controlled uniform flow is desired, linked with a small pressure
drop across the thickness of the plate.It is an object of the invention to avoid this disadvantage of the
known gas-permeable metal fiber plates and thus to provide plates
with a controlled uniform gas flow. According to the invention,
this goal is achieved by a process according to claim 1.
In a plate according to such a process, the gas
flow is forced primarily through the holes. This feature is
favourable i.a. in view of achieving a small pressure drop across
the plate. Insofar as said plates need to be utilized at very high temperatures,
the metal fibers that are used must be resistant to these
temperatures. The equivalent fiber diameters may range between
about 8 µm and 150 µm. With an equivalent fiber diameter is meant
here the diameter of a fictive perfectly cylindrical fiber, the
cross-section surface of which corresponds to the average cross-section
surface of a real fiber which is not perfectly circular or
even not circular at all. The thickness of the plate is preferably
between 0.8 mm and 4 mm and the plate is sufficiently rigid and
strong to resist the selected pressure drops at the desired porosities.
Plate thicknesses of 1, 2 and 3 mm, for example, are suitable.
The porous plate therefore does not need any extra support
near its bottom surface or its top surface (e.g. with a steel
plate). Thus the bottom and top surfaces remain freely accessible.It is another object of the invention to provide a gas burner
device comprising a housing with supply means for the gas to be
burned, a distribution element for the gas stream and a porous
metal fiber plate as a burner membrane which enables a controllable
and uniform gas flow to the
