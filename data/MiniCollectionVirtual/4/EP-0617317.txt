<ABSTRACT>
A radiation sensitive emulsion is disclosed 
comprised of a dispersing medium and silver halide 

grains. At least 50 percent of total grain projected 
area is accounted for by tabular grains bounded by {100} 

major faces having adjacent edge ratios of less than 10, 
each having an aspect ratio of at least 2, containing on 

average at least one pair of metal ions chosen from group 
VIII, periods 5 and 6, at adjacent cation sites in their 

crystal lattice, and internally at their nucleation site 
containing iodide and at least 50 mole percent chloride. 
The emulsions are prepared by the steps of (a) 
introducing silver and halide salts into a dispersing 

medium so that nucleation of the tabular grains occurs in 
the presence of iodide with chloride accounting for at 

least 50 mole percent of the halide present in the 
dispersing medium and the pCl of the dispersing medium 

being maintained in the range of from 0.5 to 3.5, (b) 
following nucleation completing grain growth under 

conditions that maintain the {100} major faces of the 
tabular grains, and (c) during at least one of steps (a) 

and (b) introducing into the dispersing medium oligmers 
of group VIII, period 5 or 6, metal, wherein each 

oligomer contains at least two metal ions and on average 
at least two metal ions are incorporated in each grain in 

adjacent cation sites.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radiation sensitive 
silver halide emulsions and to processes for their 
preparation. During the 1980's a marked advance took place 
in silver halide photography based on the discovery that 
a wide range of photographic advantages, such as improved 
speed-granularity relationships, increased covering power 
both on an absolute basis and as a function of binder 
hardening, more rapid developability, increased thermal 
stability, increased separation of native and spectral 
sensitization imparted imaging speeds, and improved image 
sharpness in both mono- and multi-emulsion layer formats, 
can be achieved by employing tabular grain emulsions. An emulsion is generally understood to be a 
"tabular grain emulsion" when tabular grains account for 
at least 50 percent of total grain projected area. A 
grain is generally considered to be a tabular grain when 
the ratio of its equivalent circular diameter (ECD) to 
its thickness (t) is at least 2. The equivalent circular 
diameter of a grain is the diameter of a circle having an 
area equal to the projected area of the grain. The term 
"intermediate aspect ratio tabular grain emulsion" refers 
to an emulsion which has an average tabular grain aspect 
ratio in the range of from 5 to 8. The term "high aspect 
ratio tabular grain emulsion" refers to an emulsion which 
has an average tabular grain aspect ratio of greater than 
8. The term "thin tabular grain" is generally understood 
to be a tabular grain having a thickness of less than 0.2 
µm. The term "ultrathin tabular grain" is generally 
understood to be a tabular grain having a thickness of 
0.06 µm or less. The term "high chloride" refers to 
grains that contain at least 50 mole percent chloride 
based on silver. In referring to grains of mixed halide 
content, the halides are named in order of increasing  
 
molar concentrations--e.g., silver iodochloride contains 
a higher molar concentration of chloride than iodide. The overwhelming majority of tabular grain 
emulsions contain tabular grains that are irregular 
octahedral grains. Regular octahedral grains contain 
eight identical crystal faces, each lying in a different 
{111} crystallographic plane. Tabular irregular 
octahedra contain two or more parallel twin planes that 
separate two major grain faces lying in {111} crystal-lographic 
planes. The {111} major faces of the tabular 
grains exhibit a threefold symmetry, appearing triangular 
or hexagonal. It is generally accepted that the tabular 
shape of the grains is the result
