<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to edible fat-containing 
products comprising an indigestible fat-replacer. In this specification, unless otherwise indicated, the term 
'fat' refers to edible fatty substances in a general sense, 
including natural or synthesized fats and oils consisting 
essentially of triglycerides such as, for example, soybean 
oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, coconut oil, fish oil, lard 
and tallow, which may have been partially or completely 
hydrogenated or modified otherwise, as well as non-toxic 
fatty materials having properties similar to triglycerides, 
herein referred to as fat-replacers, which materials may be 
partially or fully indigestible. The terms fat and oil are 
used interchangeably. Over the last decade many non-triglyceride fatty substances 
have been described as potential fat-replacers in food 
products. Examples thereof are waxes, e.g. jojoba oil and 
hydrogenated jojoba oil, polysiloxanes, acylated glycerides, 
polyalkoxyglycerolethers, dicarboxylic acid esters, polyol 
fatty acid polyesters and the epoxy extended derivatives 
thereof. Examples of disclosures of fatreplacers are e.g. DD 
207 070, Journal of Food Science 49 419-428 (1984), US 
3,600,186, US 4,005,195, US 4,005,196, US 4,034,083, US 
4,582,715, US 4,582,927, EP 0 233 856, EP 0 236 288, EP 0 
235 836 and EP 0 254 547. In particular polyol fatty acid polyesters, and more 
specifically the sugar fatty acid polyesters, such as e.g. 
the sucrose fatty acid polyesters, are receiving increased 
attention as low-calorie fat-replacers in edible products. Substantially indigestible for human beings they have 
physical and organoleptic properties very similar to 
triglyceride oils and fats conventionally used in edible 
products.  Polyol fatty acid polyesters are also reported to have use 
as pharmaceutical agents e.g. in view of their ability to 
take up fat-soluble substances, such as in particular 
cholesterol, in the gastrointestinal tract, and subsequently 
remove those substances from the human body. Suitable polyol fatty acid polyesters are derived from 
aliphatic or aromatic polyols which comprise at least four 
free hydroxyl groups. Such polyols in particular include the 
group of sugar polyols, which comprises the sugars, i.e. the 
mono-, di- and polysaccharides, the corresponding sugar 
alcohols and the derivatives thereof having at least four 
free hydroxyl groups. Examples of sugar polyols include 
glucose, mannose, galactose, xylose, fructose, sorbose, 
tagatose, ribulose, xylulose, maltose,
