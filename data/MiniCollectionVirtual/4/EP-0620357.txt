<ABSTRACT>
A lining for a tunnel (10) consists of a multiplicity of individual segments (13). In an advantageous embodiment, the segments (13) extend from the floor (17) almost up to the tunnel roof (19). The segments (13) have a curvature adapted to the tunnel radius. The segments (13) rest on the floor side on supports (21) and are fastened on the roof side to the girders (23) by means of the profiled rails (37). The segments (13) are in releasable engagement with the supports in such a way that they can be pivoted about the support (21) upon assembly or dismantling. The segments (13) are connected in a yielding manner to the supports (21) and girders (23). The temperature-induced expansion or contraction of the segments (13) can thereby be absorbed. The joints between the segments (13) are sealed off watertight by a sealing profile. Lighting (29) can be provided on the girders (23).

The tunnel panel made from a number of square elements (11, 12, 13)
with a row of supports (21) on both tunnel sides on the tunnel floor

(17) and on the tunnel elements at least one tunnel profile (23, 24),
are 
characterised by
 two opposite element ends (11, 12, 13) which are
fastened to the supports (21) and the tunnel profiles ( 23, 24).
The tunnel panel according to claim 1, is 
characterised by
 the
segments (11,12,13), being flexibly connected with the tunnel profile

(23, 24) and the fasteners (21).
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 2, is 
characterised by
 the
segments (11,12,13) with the fasteners (21), being releasable.
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 3, is 
characterised by
 the
segments (11, 13), being swingable on assembly and disassembly

with the fastener (21).
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 4, is 
characterised by
 the
segments (11, 13) having a small drain (45) at the bottom (43), which

mesh the fasteners (21) with an axle.
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 5, is 
characterised by
 a
an arched segment (13), which roughly runs from the tunnel floor up

to the top of the tunnel (19). 
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 5, is 
characterised by
 a
first and second segment (11, 12) and for on the tunnel panel (18)

two rows of opposite tunnel profiles (24) are planned, whereby the
first segment is (11) laterally on the supports (21) and the brackets

(24) and the second segments are each connected with the two
opposite positioned tunnel profiles.
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 7, is 
characterised by
 the
tunnel profile (23, 24), having two buffers (55) as means of fastening

the segments (13).
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 8, is 
characterised by
 the
segments (11, 12, 13), being fixed to the tunnel profile (23, 24) e.g. by

using a metal profile (36, 37, 38).
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 9, is 
characterised by
 the
side edges (14, 14') of the next segments (11,12, 13, 13'), overlapping

at least partly.
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 10, is 
characterised by
 the
contact points between the segments (11, 12, 13) and the tunnel

profile (23,24) or supports (21), where rubber supports (41, 53)
are to be fitted. 
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 12, is 
characterised by
 the
segments (11, 12, 13), being made of glass-fibre reinforced

polyester resin.
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 11, is 
characterised by
 the
segments (11, 12, 13), having a core made of insulation material

(31), which is bedded in glass-fibre reinforced polyester resin,
forming one panel.
The tunnel panel according to claim 12 or 13, is 
characterised by

the bonding of the insulation material (31) and the glass-fibre
reinforced polyester resin to form one panel.
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 14, is 
characterised by

the use of an elastic sealing agent.
The tunnel panel according to claim 15, is 
characterised by
 a
sealing section (61) with minimum one sealing lip (67, 69),

which seals between the gaps at least on one side of the elements.
The tunnel panel according to claim 16, is 
characterised by
 a
sealing section (61), having two curved outward facing sealing lips

(67, 69) ,which are joined with a connecting strap in the centre
(65). 
The tunnel panel according to claim 17 , is 
characterised by
 a
connecting strap (65) of two almost square sticking out profile

parts facing each other (71), which centre the installed sealing
section (61) in the gap (63).
The tunnel panel according to claim 1 to 18, is 
characterised by

a planned cable tunnel and a light (29) on the tunnel profile
(23,24)
The technique of fastening tunnel panels (15) from a number
of rectangular segments (11, 12, 13) on the floor (17) on

both sides of the tunnel with at least one row of supports
(21), and on the tunnel panels at least one row of tunnel

profiles (23, 24), are 
characterised by
 fastening them to a tunnel
panel (11, 13) with the bottom end of the supports (21)

against the tunnel profile (23, 24), swingable and flexibly
attached. For the tunnel panel (12) two opposite positioned

brackets are flexibly attached (24).
The technique according to claim 20, is 
characterised by

the gaps (61) between the segments or panels (11, 12, 13),
being sealed by putting in a sealing section (63).
