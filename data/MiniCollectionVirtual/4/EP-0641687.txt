<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an impact-absorbing and/or shock-absorbing component (20), in particular a front protection bar, and of the methods for producing the same. The impact-absorbing and/or shock-absorbing stiffened component (20) can be fastened on load-bearing parts of a vehicle body via a securing means and exhibits a stiffened, inner core (34). Said core (34) is surrounded by an impact-absorbing material (36). Furthermore, the core (34) is formed by a surface-enclosing framework consisting of a non-metallic material which is shock-resistant and fracture tough at least when combined with the material enclosing it. Moreover, the core (34) is enclosed on all sides by an energy-absorbing material (36) which penetrates, at least in certain areas, into the structure of the core and is adapted to the material of the core such that it can be recycled together with the core without any intermediate steps. The non-metallic framework is formed by a sheet-like or tubular woven or laid structure consisting of glass fibres, high-strength plastic fibres, e.g. aramide fibres with a high expansion resistance, and a high degree of strength and flexibility and/or plastic (carbon) fibres and/or textile fibres, such structure being oriented in the interior of the stiffening-rib cross-section such that it corresponds with the loading profile of the relevant stiffening rib.

A shock- and/or impact-absorbent component comprising bars, in particular
in the form of a front protection guard assembly,


wherein the component can be secured by way of a holder at selected points to
load-bearing parts of a motor vehicle body and has a three-dimensional core in the bars,

and

   characterised in that

the core (34; 134) is in the form of a surface-engaging support structure
comprising a non-metal material, and
the energy-absorbent material surrounds the core on all sides to form a full

cross-section and in a region-wise manner to over the full surface area penetrates into
the three-dimensional structure of the core in such a way or is involved in a connection

to said structure of such a nature
that the surface-engaging support structure of the core in conjunction with the
material (36; 136) which encloses it or penetrates thereinto forms a fracture-resistant

and impact-resistant component.

the same category are used for the energy-absorbent material and for the material of the

core, which plastics materials can be fed to a recycling process after a grinding process
without further intermediate sorting steps.
A component according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the non-metal
support structure is formed by a flat or tubular cloth or laid structure (38) of glass

fibres, high-strength plastics fibres such as for example aramid fibres with a high level

woven or laid structures (34) relative to each other is adapted to the loading profile of

the bar in question.
A component according to one of claims 3 to 7 characterised in that the
support structure is impregnated with an agent by way of which the connection to the

shock-absorbent material (36; 136) enclosing it can be controlled.
