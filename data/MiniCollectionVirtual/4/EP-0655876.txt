<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the processing of information signals
and, more particularly, to techniques for efficiently encoding audio signals, including
signals representative of voice and music.A significant amount of effort has been directed in recent years to so-called
perceptual audio coding, or PAC. In accordance with this technique, each of a
succession of time domain blocks of an audio signal is coded in the frequency
domain. Specifically, the frequency domain representation of each block is divided
into coder bands, each of which is individually coded, based on psycho-acoustic
criteria, in such a way that the audio signal is significantly "compressed," meaning
that the number of bits required to represent the audio signal is significantly less than
would be the case if the audio signal were represented in a more simplistic digital
format, such as in the form of PCM words.When the audio signal comprises two or more input channels, such as
the left and right channels of stereophonic (stereo) music, the above-described
perceptual coding is carried out on a like number of so-called matrixed channels. In
the most straightforward implementation, each matrixed channel is directly derived
from a respective input channel. Thus in the stereo music case, for example, this
would mean that the perceptual coding codes the frequency domain representation of
the left stereo input channel over time, denoted herein as "L", and, separately, the
frequency domain representation of the right stereo input channel over time, denoted
herein as "R". However, further compression can be achieved when the input
channels are highly correlated with one another--as, indeed, is almost always the
case with stereo music channels--by switching the coding carried out for each coder
band between two coding modes in which different sets of matrixed channels are
used. In one of the modes, the set of two matrixed channels simply comprises the
input channels L and R. In the other mode, the set of two matrixed channels
comprises S=(L+R)/2 and D=(L-R)/2. The S and D channels are referred to as
sum/difference channels. This technique is taught in U.S. Patent 5,285,498 issued
February 8, 1994 to J. D. Johnston, hereinafter referred to as "the Johnston patent."More recently, the art has turned its attention to the perceptual coding of
more-than-two-channel audio, such as five-channel audio. (As will apparent to those
skilled in the art as this description continues, the invention can, however, be
implemented in a system having other
