<ABSTRACT>
A helical type tape recording and reproducing system records blocks of user data of predetermined size by reformatting the user data blocks into physical blocks that are recorded on tape, with the physical blocks being recorded as double frames. Each double frame is recorded on a set of successive helical tracks, preferably 32 tracks. Each double frame has system format data interleaved with the user data block data which identifies the double frame as being of a particular type. The present invention is directed to the types of double frames that are used to begin a recording, particularly an append recording which involves recording by the system at a previously recorded tape which may have been recorded by a different system, as well as the types of double frames that are used to end a recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and 
more particularly, to recording and reproducing apparatus 
and methods for achieving very high density recording of 
digital information at very high transfer rates. There are many different recording formats developed for 
data recording and reproducing. A commonly used format for 
high capacity systems is IBM's 3480 multi-track tape 
cartridge format in which the tape transport employs a 
stationary head and records data along longitudinal tracks. 
Since the late 1970's rotary head helical scan recorders, a 
technology developed originally for video recorders, have 
been used for recording data. In helical scan recorders, 
the tape is transported past a rapidly rotating head along a 
helical path whereby data is recorded diagonally across the 
tape. Compared to longitudinal recorders, helical scan 
recorders generate high recording densities and lower tape 
speeds for a given data transfer rate. One aspect of the present invention is directed to a 
magnetic recording and reproducing system that has a 
recording format that records blocks of data of 
predetermined size as specified by a host or user system and 
the present system restructures the user data blocks into 
physical blocks that are recorded on tape, with the physical 
blocks being preferably recorded in what are referred to 
herein as double frames. Each double frame is recorded on a 
set of successive helical tracks, preferably thirty-two 
tracks. Each double frame has system format data 
interleaved with the user data block data which identifies 
the double frame as being of a particular type. IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, August 1989, 
pages 660-670, disclose that twenty-two data frames each 
containing two helical-scan tracks form a data group.  
 A double frame provides important information for 
performing, recording and reproducing operations, including 
the capability of searching for user data blocks, accessing 
the data blocks for reproducing them, and recording new data 
at a particular location, among other capabilities. One object of the present invention is to provide such an 
improved system which has unique types of double frames that 
are used to end a recording, which perform the dual function 
of identifying the end of a recording and also indicating 
whether the recording was completed successfully or not. It is known from EP-A-0272130 to provide a system adapted to 
selectively record digital user data from a host source on a 
magnetic tape, and to

<CLAIMS>
A system adapted to selectively record digital user data 
from a host source on a magnetic tape, and to reproduce 

recorded data, said system comprising: 

recording and playback means (32) adapted to selectively 
record and reproduce information data including said user 

data and system format data in physical blocks (PB) of 
predetermined size on a helical-scan recording area of said 

tape, each physical block being recorded on a set composed 
of a multiplicity of helical-scan tracks (170); and 
processing means (42) for generating said format data during 
recording and for providing said user data and said system 

format data to said recording and playback means for 
recording thereby on said tape, said processing means 

generating a subarea matrix of said system format data for 
recording on predetermined helical-scan tracks of each 

physical block, said system format data including data which 
can identify any of said physical blocks as a physical block 

of an end type; 
characterised in that said processing means produces system 
format data (HTTY) which identifies a physical block as a 

physical block of one of a variety of different end types, 
of which one type (EOR) indicates that recording of user 

data has been successfully completed and at least one other 
type (EOR/E,EOR/T) indicates that the recording of user data 

has not been successfully completed. 
A system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said system 
records two consecutive physical blocks of an en
d type after 
the recording of user data has been completed.  

 
A system according to claim 1 wherein the user data is 
contained in data blocks that are identified by files, and 

said system records each of said files of user data in at 
least one associated file section, and said system format 

data further includes data (FSN) that specifies the 
identification of said associated file section that 

corresponds to user data being recorded by said recording 
and playback means, said processing means causing said 

recording and playback means to record a physical block of 
an end type with the same identification as the final file 

section of user data. 
A system according to any foregoing claim wherein said 
processing means causes said recording and playback means to 

record said physical block as a said one end type (EOR) 
after the recording of user data has been successfully 

completed. 
A system according to claim 4 wherein said system 
includes error detecting means adapted to receive said 

reproduced data from said recording and playback means for 
detecting writing errors during a recording process, said 

error detecting means producing an error signal for a 
particular physical block when writing errors exceed a 

predetermined criteria, said processing means causes said 
recording and playback means to record said physical block 

as a respective end type (EOR/E) after the recording of user 
data has been completed and said error detecting means has 

produced an error signal for at least one prior physical 
block. 
A system according to claim 4 or 5 wherein said system 
includes buffer means having a capacity to retain physical 

blocks of data, said buffer means being in communication  
 

with said recording and playback means and selectively 
forwarding physical blocks of data thereto for recording, 

said buffer means producing an underflow signal for a 
particular physical block when sufficient user data is not 

present in said buffer means for forwarding to said 
recording and playback means for recording, said processing 

means causes said recording and playback means to record

commands said system to record a physical block of user data 
as a physical block of an amble type, said recording and 

playback means is disabled from recording in response to a 
disabling signal, and the receipt of said operating command 

causes said processing means to produce said disabling 
signal to said recording and playback means during the first 

portion of the physical block and not to produce the 
disabling signal during the second portion, said processing 

means producing system format data which identifies said 
physical block as a physical block of the amble type in
