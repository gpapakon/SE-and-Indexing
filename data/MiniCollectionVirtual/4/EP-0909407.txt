<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photosensitive thermosetting resin composition, more specifically
to a novel photosensitive thermosetting resin composition which is useful as a solder resist
for a printed wiring board, and a process for forming a solder resist pattern by coating the
photosensitive thermosetting resin composition, carrying out drying by a dryer at a constant
temperature, exposing the composition selectively through a film on which a predetermined
pattern is formed, with active rays, developing an unexposed portion and further carrying
out heating.The present invention relates to a photosensitive thermosetting resin composition which is
suitable as a solder resist having excellent adhesion property, water-soluble flux resistance,
water resistance, moisture resistance, electric characteristics, photosensitivity, resolution
property, soldering resistance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance and whitening
resistance and also has adhesion property on a rust preventive used for protecting the
circuit of a printed wiring board.According to the present invention, it becomes possible to cope with attachment of gas to
surrounding apparatuses caused by gas generation which is a problem when a printed
wiring board is produced, and environmental problems, etc. caused by gas generation.In general, a printed wiring board has been used frequently for incorporating electronic
parts compactly. The printed wiring board is obtained by etching a copper foil clad on a
laminate along a circuit wiring, and electronic parts are arranged at predetermined places
and soldered. A solder resist is used in a step prior to soldering of electronic parts to such a
printed wiring board, and a film is formed on the entire surface of a circuit conductor except
portions on which electronic parts are to be soldered. Such a film not only functions as an
insulating film which prevents soldering from being attached to unnecessary portions when
soldering is carried out, but also functions as a protective film which prevents corrosion
caused by oxidation and moisture when a circuit conductor is exposed directly to air, so that
the film is indispensable. In the prior art, such solder resists have been formed by screen
printing them on substrates and setting them by UV rays or heat. These solder resists for
industrial use have been disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 
14044/1976.As a material for public welfare obtained by paying attention to productivity, a rapid-setting
UV ray-setting type material as
