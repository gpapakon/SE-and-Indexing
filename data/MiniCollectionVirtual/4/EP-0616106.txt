<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a window or a door with a hinge fitting 1 for a sash/leaf which is mounted on a frame such that it can be rotated, tilted or folded out at least about a lateral axis, in particular with a corner-bearing assembly for side/bottom hung sash windows, doors or the like, composed of a frame articulation component 2 and of a sash/leaf articulation component 3, of which each is anchored, via a fastening socket 5 and 9, respectively, such that it bears on the frame or sash/leaf rebate peripheral surface and bears an articulation eyelet 18 and 22, respectively, or a bearing sleeve, which permanently projects beyond the room-side end surface of the frame and engages in a concealed manner into a receiving means provided on the rear side in the overhang impact surface of the sash/leaf. In order that the hinge fittings can be adjusted at least transversely with respect to the common articulation axis and parallel with respect to the closure plane of the door or of the window, it is provided   - that the fastening socket 9 of the sash/leaf articulation component 3 is composed of a retaining rail 26, which is mounted such that it is fixed to the sash/leaf, and of a carrier rail 27 which can be guided thereon such that it can be longitudinally displaced transversely with respect to the axis 24-24 of the articulation eyelets or bearing sleeves 18, 22, in the direction of the sash/leaf plane, - that the carrier rail 27 has the sash/leaf-side articulation eyelet or the sash/leaf-side articulation sleeve 22, with the axis position 24-24 directed transversely with respect to their displacement direction, - that the carrier rail 27 and retaining rail 26 are connected by a threaded member 37 such that they can be longitudinally displaced with respect to one another, - and that the threaded member 37, adjacent or next to the articulation eyelets or bearing sleeves 18, 22, is in positively locking engagement both with the carrier rail 27 and with the retaining rail 26 and is accessible for actuation on that side of the sash/leaf rebate peripheral surface 10 which is parallel to the axis 24-24 of the articulation eyelets or bearing sleeves 18, 22.

<CLAIMS>
A window or door comprising a hinge fitting (1),
more particularly a corner bearing assembly for turntilt

windows, doors or the like for a leaf mounted on a
fixed frame so as to be turnable, tiltable or hingeable

at least around a lateral axis and comprising a frame
joint unit (2) and a leaf joint unit (3), each

adjoining and anchored to the frame or leaf rebate
peripheral surface by a securing plinth (5, 9

respectively) and bearing a boss (18, 22) or bearing
sleeve which permanently projects over the room-side

end face of the fixed frame and is concealed and
engages in a recess in the back of the cheek-striker

surface of the leaf, the frame joint unit (2) and the
leaf joint unit (3) being in jointed engagement only

via a pivot (19) and a bearing block (21) in the
recess, characterised in that


the plinth (9) for securing the leaf joint unit
(3) comprises a retaining rail (26) mounted and secured

to the leaf and a carrier rail (27) guided for
longitudinal motion on the retaining rail transversely

to the axis (24-24) of the bosses or bearing sleeves
(18, 22) in the direction of the leaf plane,
the carrier rail (27) comprises the leaf-side boss
or the leaf-side bearing sleeve (22) with an axis

position (24-24) extending transversely to the
direction of motion thereof,
the carrier rail (27) and the retaining rail (26)
are connected for longitudinal adjustment relatively to

one another via a screwthreaded member (37), and 
the screwthreaded member (37) adjoining or next to
the bosses or bearing sleeves (18, 22) is in positive

engagement both with the carrier rail (27) and with the
retaining rail (26) and is accessible for actuation at

the side of the leaf rebate peripheral surface (10)
parallel to the axis (24-24) of the bosses or bearing

sleeves,

wherein the pivot (19) has a ball head (20) on which a
ball socket (23) abuts in the boss or in the bearing

sleeve (22) of the leaf joint unit (3), and

wherein the ball socket (23) is axially movable to a
limited extent by a setscrew (25) or the like in the

boss or in the bearing sleeve (22).
A window or door comprising a hinge fitting
according to claim 1, characterised by an angle rail

(4, 65) more particularly of band material having a
flat rectangular cross-section inserted into a stepped

profiled groove (12) of the rebate peripheral surface
(10) on a corner of the leaf, the retaining rail (26)

of the leaf joint unit (3) being securable in position
(30, 31) and fixable (32, 33) to one limb (4a) of the

angle rail and the other limb (4b) containing a cut-out
(42) into which the screwthreaded member (37) can at

one end be releasably and positively engaged via a
peripheral groove (40) nears its free end whereas at

the other end side it is adjustable by screwing into a
screwthreaded boss (36) on the carrier rail (27).
A window or door comprising a hinge fitting
according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 

angle rail (4) is formed by the face bracket (65) of a
corner deflector (51).
A window or door comprising a hinge fitting
according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in

that the carrier rail (27) is connected in positive
sliding manner to the retaining rail (26) via a

dovetail or T-shaped guide strip (28), whereas the
retaining rail (26) can be coupled to one limb (4a) of

the angle rail (4) transversely to its longitudinal
direction by a hole and pin plug connection (30, 31) or

be additionally screwed (63, 64).
A window or door comprising a hinge fitting
according to any of claims 2 to 5, chracterised in that

the carrier rail (27) has an arm (35) extending
parallel to the axis (24-24) of its boss or its bearing

sleeve (22), the arm ending in a fixing channel (25)
which engages a locking projection (46) which extends

from the second limb (4b) of the angle rail (4).
A window or door comprising a hinge fitting
according to claim 5, characterised in that the locking

projection (46) comprises a bolt which is fastened by
screwing in a screwthreaded hole (47) on the second

limb (4) of the angle rail (4).
