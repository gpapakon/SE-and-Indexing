<ABSTRACT>
An inner-line fishing rod includes a fore-butt rod 
member (4), a line entrance opening (4A) defined in an outer 

surface of the fore-butt rod member (4), a telescopic rod 
member (3) accommodatable inside the fore-butt rod member (4) 

to be protractible from and retractable into the fore-butt 
rod member (4). An inner opening is defined at a rear end 

of the telescopic rod member (3) for allowing introduction 
of a fishing line (a) into the telescopic rod member (3). 

A protracted state of the telescopic rod member (3) is 
maintained by engagement between a rear end of the telescopic 

member (3) and an inner face of a forward end of the fore-butt 
rod member (4). A retracted state of the telescopic 

member (3) is determined in position and maintained by a 
position maintaining portion (8) provided on the telescopic 

member (3) forwardly of the inner opening, the position 
maintaining portion (8) coming into contact with the fore-butt 

rod member (4) when the telescopic rod member (3) is 
retracted, thereby to determine the retracted position of the 

telescopic rod member (3) where the line entrance opening 
(4A) and the inner opening are positioned adjacent to each 

other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inner-line
fishing rod. A fishing rod having the features as set forth in the
preamble portion of claim 1 is known for example from FR-A-1,592,422.To describe briefly the features of this fishing rod,
a line entrance opening is defined in an outer surface
of a fore-butt rod member. At a rear end of a
telescopic rod member to be protractibly and
retractably accommodated within the fore-butt rod
member, there is defined an opening for allowing
introduction of a fishing line into an inner hollow
space of the telescopic rod member. Further, adjacent
the line entrance opening and inside the fore-butt rod
member, there is formed a plate-like abutment element
for receiving rear ends of respective telescopic rod
members while restricting further insertion of the
telescopic rod members. And, this abutment element
defines, at a center position thereof, a line 
insertion opening which communicates with the opening
of the telescopic rod member.According to the above-described conventional
construction, for inserting a fishing line into the
fishing rod with its telescopic rod members retracted
therein, first, a line inserting tool to which the
fishing line is fixed is inserted from the line
entrance opening. Then, the tool together with the
line is further inserted through the line inserting
opening of the abutment member into the inside of the
telescopic rod members. However, since the line
inserting opening of the plate-like abutment element
is present between the line entrance opening and the
opening of the telescopic rod member, the line
inserting operation is troublesome and time consuming.
Further, as the opening of the telescopic rod member
can not be seen from the outside of the rod, this adds
to the difficulty of the operation.Moreover, according to the conventional
construction, since the plate-like abutment element is
formed integrally as a part of the rod member to be
held within a butt rod member, the telescopic rod
members i.e. a tiptop rod member and an intermediate
rod member(s) can not be withdrawn from the butt end
opening of the butt rod member. In order to allow
this possibility of withdrawal of the tiptop rod
member or the like, the plate-like abutment element, 
which is to provided adjacent the line entrance
opening, needs to be provided in a detachable manner.
However, such detachable construction adjacent the
line entrance opening is too difficult to realize.In view of the above, a primary object of the
present invention is to provide an improved
