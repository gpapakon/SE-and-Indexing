<ABSTRACT>
The lifting plate (16) of a lifter (10) can be moved up and down by means of a hydraulically actuated lifting device (12). The back rest (18) can be pivoted forwards and backwards by means of a pivoting device (19) which is likewise operated hydraulically. Both working devices (12, 19) are connected to a multi-valve housing (20) which is located below the lifting plate (16) and does not have any manually operated devices. By contrast, the actuation takes place hydraulically via remote control. For this purpose, a manual control unit (30) having a number of in-built servo valves is connected to the multi-valve housing (20) via a flexible cable (28) which comprises a number of thin control tubes and a pressure water supply tube.

A lift (10), insertable into a bathtub, for disabled people, 
comprising a base frame (13), a lifting plate (16), a guide frame 

(14) connecting the lifting plate (16) to the base frame (13), a 
hydraulic lifting device (12) having a valve arrangement (20) 

arranged below the bottom plane of the lifting plate (16), and a 
manual control unit (30) connected to the valve arrangement (20), 

characterised in that the manual control unit (30) is connected to 
the valve arrangement (20) by means of a plurality of flexible 

tubes and has a number of manually operable servo valves (34) of 
substantially like construction each having a control chamber 

(102) on one side of a valve seat (86), one of the tubes (34) [sic - 36] 

opening into the control chamber (102), in that a pressure 
chamber (88) [sic - 80]
 is formed in each servo valve (34) on the 
other side of the valve seat (86), in that the pressure chambers (80) 

of all the servo valves (34) are connected to a common tube (38) 
of the plurality of tubes (36, 38), in that all the servo valves (34) are 

hydraulically and/or mechanically loaded in the closed position, in 
that the control chamber (102) of each servo valve (34), in the 

closed position thereof, is connected to a discharge line (40), and 
in that each servo valve (34) has a manually operable actuating 

member (58) movable from a rest position against the action of a 
restoring force into one or more operating positions in which the 

pressure chamber (80) communicates with the control chamber 
(102), but the latter is sealed off from the discharge line (40).  

 
A lift according to claim 1, characterised in that a back rest (18) is 
pivotably arranged on the lifting plate (16) and is acted upon by a 

hydraulic pivoting device (19), in that the valve arrangement (20) 
has at least four operating valves and the manual control unit (30) 

has the same number of servo valves (34), and in that each 
operating valve is connected to a servo valve (34) by a separate 

control tube (36). 
A lift according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that each servo 
valve (34) is formed so that its control chamber (102) is always 

connected either to the discharge line (40) or to the pressure 
chamber (80). 
A lift according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
each servo valve (34) has a spring-operated closing member (82) 

placeable against the valve seat (86) and movable by the 
actuating member (58), and in that the actuating member (58), 

when moved out of its rest position, seals the control chamber 
(102) off from the discharge line (40). 
A lift according to claim 4, characterised in that the actuating 
member (58) has an axial bore opening at the end and 

communicating with the discharge line (40) via a radial bore, in 
that the actuating member (58), in its rest position, is at a distance 

from the closing member (82), the axial bore of the actuating 
member (58) opening into the control chamber (102), and in that, 

when the servo valve (34) is operated, the actuating member (58) 
comes to rest against the closing member (82) during a first part of 

the stroke, thereby closing the end opening, and lifts the closing  
 

member (82) from the valve seat (86) during the remainder of the 
stroke. 
A lift according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterised in that 
the four servo valves (34) are arranged so as to be axially parallel 

and their axes intersect the corners of a square. 
A lift according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
all the servo valves (34) have a common central manual control 

member (70) having a plurality of control positions (74). 
A lift according to claim 7, characterised in that the manual 
control member (70) has a cup-shaped bearing member (66) 

mounted on complementary spherical surfaces (68) of the casing 
(32) or of a casing head (62, 64) of the manual control unit (30) so 

as to be pivotable in at least two mutually perpendicular planes, 
and in that the bearing member (66) has a circumferentially 

closed outer flange or at least four radial arms distributed over the 
circumference and engaging over the ends of the actuating 

members (58) of the servo valves (34). 
A lift according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 
the actuating member (58) of each servo valve (34) is loaded by 

means of a spring (76) in the rest position, and in that the non-operated 
manual control member (70) is held in the central 

position by the actuating members (58). 
A lift according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that 
the manual control member (70) comprises a pivoting lever 

projecting from the casing (32) of the manual control unit (30) and  
 

guided in a gate (74) having two guide slots intersecting one 
another at right angles.
