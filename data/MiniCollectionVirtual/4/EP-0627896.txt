<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new and improved
surgical endoclip adapted to be used with either the well
known U.S. Surgical Corporation type applier which has
achieved widespread use and sometimes is known by the
trademark Auto Suture or a modification thereof.Surgical endoclips are metal devices used to occlude
ducts or vessels during surgical procedures. When two
clips are applied to a duct or vessel the duct can be
severed between them, and if the clips are properly
applied and secured, leakage of fluid, such as blood or
bile is prevented. Ultimately, the structure occluded by
the clip is permanently stenosed and sealed by normal
healing processes. The device used to apply an endoclip
can be used for both open and closed, laparoscopic,
surgical procedures.Prior endoclips, made of titanium, are generally U-shaped
with the legs squeezed together to seal a vessel.
Such clips have a tendency to come off the ducts or
vessels to which they have been applied, in part, because
the legs may tend to spread apart. Clips have been
observed coming off along the transverse axis along which
they had been applied as they were being placed and
immediately after they had been placed. Such clips also
can work themselves off in the severed end of the duct or
vessel along the long axis. In either case, the vessel
lumen would cease to be effectively occluded, and bile or
blood would be free to leak into in postoperative
patients which has sometimes led to surgical re-exploration,
transfusion therapy and other untoward
complications. Since these problems are not uncommon,
the inventors have provided a new endoclip to reduce the
risk of slippage after application. One of the approved current clips is designed so
that the inner surfaces of the U-shaped arms are smooth.
Another current clip is designed so that the inner
surfaces of its U-shaped arms are corrugated. However,
after application, both clips are open and free at one
end, even though they are squeezed down across the duct
and thus, may slip off the duct along its transverse
axis. The occlusions created by and the positions of
these clips across the duct are maintained solely by
virtue of titanium's lack of "memory"--i.e., once
crimped, the clips tend to remain crimped. These clips
are not secured in any way other than by squeezing or
crimping them across the duct after the clip has been
properly placed.U.S. Surgical Corporation has been very successful
in promoting its Auto Suture Disposable Clip Applier.
This applier is the subject of several United States
Patents,

<CLAIMS>
A surgical endoclip (10) comprising a thin metallic unitary member comprising
a base (12) terminating in a forward end (14) in an upwardly and rearwardly extending

section (16), said upwardly and rearwardly extending section (16) terminating in a
lower free-end (18), a corner (20) formed between said lower free-end (18) and said

forward end (14) of said base (12), said endoclip (10) further comprising an upwardly
and forwardly extending intermediate section (26) extending from the rearward end of

said base (12), said upwardly and forwardly extending intermediate section (26)
terminating in an upper arm (22) substantially parallel to said base (12), said upper arm

(22) terminating in an upper free-end (24), said surgical endoclip (10) having an open
position with said surgical endoclip lying within an initial plane, said surgical endoclip

deformable to a closed position by pressure applied to said upper arm (22) and base
(12) to displace said upper free-end (24) to be captured and clamped in said corner (20)

under said lower free-end (16) to form a circumferential closure on a duct (40) to be
sealed with said endoclip (10), characterised in that said upper free-end (24) terminates

in a Vee (52) and said base (12) comprises a groove (50) to receive and hold said Vee
(52) as said upper free-end (24) moves to be captured in said corner (20), so that the

ends (18, 24) are maintained within said initial plane as said endoclip (10) is closed.
A surgical endoclip according to claim 1, wherein said metallic member
comprises a bio-compatible metal.
A surgical endoclip according to claim 2 wherein said metal is titanium.
A surgical endoclip according to claim 3, wherein said base member comprises
means (28) to hold said duct (40).
A surgical endoclip according to claim 4 wherein said means to hold said duct
comprises a nubbin. 
A surgical endoclip according to claim 5, wherein said nubbin comprises a sharp
upper surface (36) adapted to pierce and hold said duct (40).
