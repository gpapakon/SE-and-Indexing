<ABSTRACT>
An optical space communication apparatus 
includes transmitting device for transmitting a first 

beam of light, receiving device for receiving a second 
beam of light, and varying device for varying the 

angles of the first and second beams of light. 
The varying device has a variable angle prism. 

In the optical space communication apparatus, an angle 
of the beam of light is varied by the variable angle 

prism so that alignment of communication optical axis 
is corrected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical space 
communication apparatus for propagating a beam of light 
through free space to thereby effect communication. Referring to Figure 1 of the accompanying 
drawings which shows the construction of an optical 
space communication apparatus according to the prior 
art in which the misalignment of a communication 
optical axis is corrected, lenses 1, 2 and a movable 
mirror 3 are arranged on an optical path from a partner 
apparatus, and a polarizing beam splitter 4, a 
partially reflecting mirror 5, a lens 6 and a light 
receiving element 7 are arranged in succession in the 
direction of reflection of the movable mirror 3. As 
shown in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings which 
partly shows the construction, the movable mirror 3 is 
rotatably engaged with a gimbal mechanism 8, which in 
turn is rotatably engaged with a fixed member 9 such as 
a lens barrel body, whereby the gimbal mechanism is 
rotatable relative to two axes orthogonal to each 
other. Also, a light emitting element 11 is provided 
through a lens 10 in the direction of reflection of the  
 
polarizing beam splitter 4, and a position detecting 
element 13 such as a CCD or a division sensor is 
provided through a lens 12 in the direction of 
reflection of the partially reflecting mirror 5. 
Further, the output of the position detecting element 
13 is connected to a drive circuit 15 through a signal 
processing circuit 14, and the output of the drive 
circuit 15 is connected to an actuator 16 for driving 
the movable mirror 3 and to an actuator 17 for driving 
the gimbal mechanism 8. In case of optical space communication, 
transmission is effected by a beam of light which is 
emitted from the light emitting element 11 being 
reflected by the movable mirror 3, and reception is 
effected by a beam of light from the partner apparatus 
being caused to enter the light receiving element 7 
through the movable mirror 3. Also, when the apparatus 
has varied its posture, the amount of variation in the 
posture is detected by the position detecting element 
13 and the movable mirror 3 is driven by the actuators 
16 and 17 to thereby correct the direction of emergence 
of the transmitted beam, the direction of incidence of 
the received beam and the spot position of the received 
beam on the surface of the light receiving element 7. In the above-described example of the prior 
art, however, the entire optical system is refracted by 
the movable mirror 3 and therefore, the barrel of the  
 
optical system
