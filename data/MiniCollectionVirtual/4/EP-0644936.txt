<DESCRIPTION>
 CHIMERIC RECEPTOR POLYPEPTIDES, HUMAN H13 PROTEINSAND USES THEREOFBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention, in the field of virology and molecular genetics, relates to nucleic acid, methods and proteins involving mammalian mutant viral receptor polypeptides, which bind viruses and/or envelope protein binding domains thereof, as well as to methods of making and using thereof, including diagnostic and therapeutic applications, such as gene therapy.Description of the Background ArtViruses infect a cell by first attaching to a cell at a viral receptor. A number of virus-specific cellular receptors have been identified, and most of these receptor molecules have other known cellular functions. The expression of these virus binding proteins or receptors is a strong determinant of susceptibility to virus infection. Binding is required for fusion of the virus envelope protein (env) to the target cell, an event that may occur at the cell surface or within an acidified endosome after receptor-mediated endocytosis (White et al., Quant . Rev. Biophys . 16: 151-195 (1983)). After fusion, the virion core enters the cytoplasm and the viral replication process is initiated. For example, in the case of HIV, recent studies suggested that cell surface molecules other than CD4 may also be important for virus entry into human cells.Ecotropic and Amphotropic Murine Retrovirus Receptors and InfectionSusceptibility of cells to infection with ecotropic (species specific) or amphotropic (species non-specific) murine leukemia virus (E-MuLV) may also be determined by binding of the virus envelope to a membrane receptor.Based on viral interference assays, four types of specific MuLV receptors have been postulated: (a) receptors for E-MuLV; (b) receptors for wild-type amphotropic MuLV; (c) 

receptors for recombinant viruses derived from E-MuLV, such as the "mink cell focus-inducing" or MCF virus; and (d) receptors for a recombinant virus derived from an amphotropic MuLV (Rein, A. et al.. Virology 136:144-152 (1984)). Recently, a cDNA clone (termed Wl) encoding the murine ecotropic retroviral receptor (ERR) (SEQ ID NO:4) was identified (Albritton, L.W. et al. , Cell 57:659-666 (1989)). This study demonstrated that susceptibility to E-MuLV infection was acquired by the expression of a single mouse gene in human EJ cells.Viral Receptor Mediated Tissue SpecificityHIV is an example of a virus exhibiting receptor- mediated tissue restriction, apparently based on its use of the CD4 protein as its primary
