<ABSTRACT>
Sulfonated ethylene/alpha olefin copolymer compositions are 
disclosed and obtained by sulfonating and neutralizing an ethylene/alpha 

olefin copolymer, suitably having a number average molecular 
weight in the range of about 800 to about 50,000, and which have a 

high degree of terminal unsaturation. At least 30% of the terminal 
unsaturation is vinylidene terminal unsaturation. The alpha olefin 

preferably has 3 to about 12 carbon atoms. 
Use as vicosity modifiers of hydrocarbons, especially 
lubricating oils, is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sulfonated olefinic copolymers. The sulfonation of unsaturated polymers such as ethylene/propylene/norbornene 
terpolymers (EPDM polymers) is well known. 
The unsaturation available in these polymer compositions permits 
facile sulfonation and the neutralized adducts have found a variety of 
applications. Indeed, the utility of such sulfonated polymers is 
generally related to their multiple ionic sites, which are capable of 
forming molecular associations creating a network. Unfortunately, 
these molecular associations in conventional sulfonated olefin polymers 
such as sulfonated EPDM (sulfo-EPDM), are undesirable in certain 
types of applications. For example, sulfo-EPDM is very effective as a 
viscosity modifier in lubricating oils at moderately high concentrations 
(cf U.S. Patent 3,931,021). At those concentrations, the 
interpolymer associations due to multiple ionic crosslinks between 
polymer chains make such ionic polymers much more effective as thickening 
agents than their nonionic EPDM precursors. At lower concentrations, 
however, sulfo-EPDM is found to be much less effective in 
thickening hydrocarbon fluids such as mineral oils. Indeed, these 
ionic polymers are even less effective than their nonionic polymer 
precursors. These results have been explained as being the consequence 
of intramolecular association (cf R. D. Lundberg, J. of AppliedPolymer Sci., 27, 12, p. 4630, 1982). Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to 
provide a new class of functionalized polymers that does not have 
multiple ionic associations.  It is another object of the present invention to provide 
novel sulfonated ethylene/alpha olefin copolymers. These and other objects of the present invention will become 
readily understood upon reading of the invention which follows. The present invention provides novel sulfonated ethylene/alpha 
olefin copolymer compositions obtained or obtainable by 
sulfonating ethylene/alpha olefin copolymer, suitably having number 
average molecular weights in the range of about 800 to about 50,000, 
and which have a high degree of terminal unsaturation. Preferably, at 
least 30% of the terminal unsaturation is vinylidene terminal 
unsaturation. Also, the alpha olefin preferably has 3 to about 12 
carbon atoms. Neutralized such copolymers are a preferred embodiment. The neutralized sulfonated polymers of the present invention 
have particular utility as viscosity modifiers of hydrocarbon fluids 
and especially as lubricating oil
