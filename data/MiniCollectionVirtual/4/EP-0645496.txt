<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a method for assembling the chords (10) of the legs supporting an oil platform, in which a stiffener (13) is welded onto each main face of a rectangular plate (12), several rectangular plates (12) equipped with the said stiffeners (13) are butt-welded together in order to form a chord (10), the said stiffeners (13) leaving a free space between them, a joining piece (15) is positioned in the region of each free space and in the extension of the stiffeners (13), and each joining piece (15) is welded from the outside. Prior to positioning and welding each stiffener (13) and each joining piece (15) there is placed on the internal edge of each zone to which the stiffener (13) connects with the plates (12), and the joining piece (15) connects with the plates (12) and the stiffeners (13), a ceramic strip (21a, 21b; 22a, 22b) matched to the profile of each zone of connection and intended to shape the route of the weld bead. The subject of the invention is also a device for the implementation of this method.

Process for assembling the girders (10) of the 
support legs (2) of an oil-drilling platform, wherein: 


a reinforcer (13) in the form of a half-shell is 
welded from the outside onto each main surface of a 

rectangular plate (12), said rectangular plate (12) 
comprising on each of its side faces teeth (14) forming 

a rack, 
a plurality of rectangular plates (12) fitted with 
said reinforcers (13) are welded end to end to form a 

girder (10), each reinforcer (13) being shorter in 
length than a plate (12) so as to define, at the 

location of the weld between the plates (12), a free 
space between two adjacent reinforcers (13), 
a connecting member (15) in the form of a half-shell 
is positioned level with each free space and on an 

extension of the reinforcers (13), 
and each connecting member (15) is welded from the 
outside on to the main surface of the plates (12) and on 

to the edges of the adjacent reinforcers to form 
continuous reinforcers on each side of said plates, 

characterised in that, prior to the positioning and 
welding of each reinforcer (13) and each connecting 

member (15), a ceramic panel (21a, 21b; 22a, 22b) 
adapted to the profile of each connecting zone and 

intended to mould the root of the weld seam is placed on 
the inner edge of each connecting zone between, on the 

one hand, the reinforcer (13) and the plates (12) and, 
on the other hand, the connecting member (15) and the 

plates (12) and reinforcers (13). 
Apparatus comprising girders assembled by the 
assembly process according to claim 1, the girders (10) 

forming the support legs (2) of an oil-drilling  
 

platform, each girder comprising sections (11) each of 
which is formed by a rectangular plate (12) intended to 

be butt-welded to the rectangular plate (12) of the 
adjacent sections (11) and comprising, on each of its 

side faces, teeth (14) forming a rack, a reinforcer (13) 
in the form of a half-shell welded to each main surface 

of the rectangular plate (12), each reinforcer (13) 
being shorter in length than a plate (12) so as to 

define a free space at the location of the weld between 
two adjacent plates (12), and connecting members (15) in 

the form of half-shells welded to each main surface of 
the plates (12) and the edge of each adjacent reinforcer 

(13) in order to form continuous reinforcers on each 
side of said plates (12), characterised in that it 

comprises means for welding, on the one hand, the 
reinforcers (13) to the main surfaces of the plates (12) 

and, on the other hand, the connecting members (15) to 
the main surfaces of the plates (12) and to the edges of 

each adjacent reinforcer (13) and means (21a, 21b; 22a, 
22b) for moulding the root of the weld seams of the 

reinforcers (13) and the connecting members (15), 
located on the inner edge of each connecting zone of 

said reinforcers (13) with the rectangular plates (12) 

and said connecting members (15) with the rectangular 
plates (12) and the reinforcers (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the means for moulding the root of the weld seams 

consist of ceramic panels (21a, 21b; 22a, 22b) mounted 
on a support (23, 24) connected to the girder (10) by 

connecting means. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the ceramic panels (21a, 21b) adapted to mould the 

roots of the weld seams of the reinforcers (13) and the 
connecting members (15) with the rectangular plates (12) 

have a section in the shape of a triangle with rounded  
 

apexes. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the panels (21a, 21b) are formed by independent 

elements (28) connected to one another by a tensioning 
cable (29) passing through said elements. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the ceramic panels (22a, 22b) intended to mould the 

roots of the weld seams between the connecting members 
(15) and the reinforcers (13) are formed by elements 

(25) articulated on one another so as to adapt to the 
radius of curvature of said reinforcers (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that each element (25) is rectangular in section and 

comprises a groove (26) on its surface facing the weld 
seam.
