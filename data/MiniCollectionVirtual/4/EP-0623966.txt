<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for receiving radio frequency signals. The system includes a receiver (25) linked by connection means (29) to an antenna (11) and means (30) for detecting selective fading of these radio frequency signals which interact with means (28) for moving the antenna, which move this antenna (11) until the selective fading disappears. The invention applies particularly to receivers installed in vehicles.
