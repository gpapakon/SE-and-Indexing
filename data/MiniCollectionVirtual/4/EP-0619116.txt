<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-osteopathic composition useful for 
therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of osteopathia. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to an anti-osteopathic composition comprising an 
aromatic carboxylic acid or its derivative as an active ingredient. The 
anti-osteopathic composition can be used for, for example, a therapeutic and 
prophylactic treatment of osteodysbolism or a therapeutic and prophylactic 
treatment of fractures. Metabolism of bones is considered to be achieved by well balanced repetitions 
of bone resorption by osteoclasts and osteogenesis by osteoblasts. Dynamic 
equilibrium is maintained between such generation process and resorption 
process in healthy adults and, as a result, weights and structures of their bones 
are maintained. It is suggested that main cause of various osteodysbolisms, 
including osteoporosis as an typical example, is an abnormal mutual cooperation 
of these two processes. Osteoporosis is a disease in which reductions of bone densities and bone 
amounts are brought about as a result of excess bone resorptions which are 
induced by a lost of the aforementioned balance with an increased bone 
resorption. This disease outbreaks in adults and is frequently observed 
particularly in women of middle and advanced age. Patients of this disease are 
susceptible to fractures because of the reductions of bone density and amount, 
and some patients fall into serious conditions, such as conditions where they 
are entirely in beds. Therefore, development of therapeutic drugs effective for 
osteoporosis is being highly desired. As medicaments for the treatment of such osteopathia, compositions such as,  
 
for example, those comprising activated-form vitamin D₃, calcitonin, 
bis-phosphonic acid, estrogen, ipriflavone, and calcium are used. Most of these 
pharmaceutical compositions are reported to have inhibitory activity on bone 
resorption or the like. However, it has not been clearly demonstrated that these 
compositions have enhancing activities on osteogenesis. Vitamin A acid (retinoic acid), an oxidative metabolite of vitamin A (retinol), has 
been reported to have therapeutic efficacy on certain types of leukemia, skin 
cancer and intractable skin diseases, in addition to its pharmacological activities 
relating to life sustainment, embryogenesis and growth of animals. Among 
retinoids (a generic term for compounds exhibiting retinoic acid-type biological 
activities) having various pharmacological activities,
