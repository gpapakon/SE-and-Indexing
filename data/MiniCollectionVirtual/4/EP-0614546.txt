<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a photographic material comprising on a support a silver halide emulsion sensitized to light of wavelengths between 600 nm and 850 nm characterized in that said silver halide emulsion comprises a red sensitizing dye having a maximum absorption between 620 nm and 680 nm, an infrared sensitizing dye having a maximum absorption between 700 nm and 850 nm and a supersensitizing compound showing no substantial absorption in said wavelength range from 600 nm to 850 nm. The photographic material is suitable for use in the silver salt diffusion transfer process and can be used for making lithographic printing plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONSILVER HALIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL1. Field of the invention.The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material sensitive to light sources emitting light between 600 and 850nm. The present invention further relates to a method for obtaining images with said photographic material and to a method for obtaining a lithographic printing plate with said photographic material.2. Background of the invention.Silver halide photographic materials sensitive to light between 600 and 850nm are commonly employed as phototypesetting materials for use in phototypesetters equiped with a laser, laser diode or LED emitting in the red and/or infrared of the spectrum. Todate on the market phototypesetters usually work with a He/Ne laser (632nm), laser diode (680nm) or LED (670nm or 780nm) . Since these light sources emit in a very narrow spectral range photographic materials were developed for each of the above mentioned light sources.Photographic phototypesetting materials include photographic films and papers used in a process for preparing a lithographic printing plate and silver salt diffusion transfer based lithographic printing plates disclosed in e.g. ϋS-P-4.501.811 and US-P-4.784.933. With the latter materials a lithographic printing plate is immediately obtained without the need of a contact exposure or camera exposure.A universal photographic material sensitive to each of the common light sources in the spectrum from 600 to 850 nm would be much more convenient because such a material would be useful in any phototypesetter operating with a light source emitting light between 600nm and 850nm. Such a universal photographic material would thus require a silver halide emulsion sensitized both in the red and infrared region of the spectrum. In principal this would be 

 possible by sensitizing the silver halide emulsion with a number of sensitizing dyes so that the spectrum between 600nm and 850nm is coverred.However several problems may arise when one tries to prepare such a photographic material. For example due to the difference in output energy between the different light sources there are different requirements for the silver halide emulsion. Thus a silver halide emulsion for use with LEDΛs that show a low output energy requires the intrinsic sensitivity of the silver halide emulsion to be high. The intrinsic sensitivity of these emulsions can be increased by increasing the bromide content of the silver halide. Such a practice reduces however the speed of development of the silver
