<DESCRIPTION>
 ACCELERATED TOKEN RING NETWORKField of the InventionThis invention relates to token ring computer networks and, more particularly, to token ring networks wherein stations are decoupled into separate clock domains for improved performance.Background of the InventionA token ring computer network includes a plurality of stations connected to a data transmission path, or trunk, in the form of a closed loop. A block diagram of a conventional token ring network is shown in FIG. 1. Trunk coupling units (TCU's) 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, etc. are connected in series on a ring 20. Stations 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 receive and transmit signals through TCU's 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, respectively. A token ring network can include up to 250 stations. The ring 20 can comprise shielded twisted pair, unshielded twisted pair, optical fiber, or any other suitable media (for example, microwave). 

 Information is transmitted on the token ring network in frames. Token ring networks operate such that only one station at a time transmits data. The frame containing the data includes source and destination addresses. After transmission of data has been completed by one station a token circulates on the ring 20 until another station seizes the token and begins transmitting data.The token ring network uses a synchronous data transmission technique wherein the clock and data are combined in the transmitted signal. As used herein, the term "signal" refers to the combined data and clock utilized in token ring networks. Although the clock is recovered from the signal, the data and clock remain combined, except within the station. A clock transition occurs at the center of each data bit position. A transition or a lack thereof at the beginning of each bit position indicates a one or a zero in the binary data. In the insert mode, the transmitted signal is received by a TCTJ from its upstream neighbor and is forwarded to the station. The station receives the signal and recovers the clock and data it contains. The station then combines the two to form a new signal and retransmits the signal to its TCU. Its TCU in turn forwards the signal to its downstream neighbor. In bypass mode, as contrasted with insert mode, the TCÏ‹ forwards the signal it receives from its upstream neighbor directly to its downstream neighbor. This process is repeated until the signal 

reaches the active monitor. When the active monitor receives the signal, it sinks the recovered clock and stores the recovered data in a FIFO buffer. The active monitor then builds a new signal with
