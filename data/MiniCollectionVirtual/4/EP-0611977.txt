<ABSTRACT>
Methods are disclosed by which the effects of a defective 
electromechanical pixel 20 having a beam 30 and a hinge 34,36 are 

mitigated. These methods may damage the hinge 34,36 or the beam 30 and 
comprise the step of applying a voltage sufficient to damage the hinge 

34,36 or beam 30 of said electromechanical pixel 20 by mechanical 
overstress, thermal overstress, electrochemical reaction, or thermally 

induced chemical reaction. Other methods are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital micro-mirror devices (DMD's), also 
known as deformable mirror devices, and more particularly to a method of 
mitigating the effects of defective pixels in such devices. DMD's have found numerous applications in the areas of optical 
information processing, projection displays, and electrostatic printing. See 
references cited in L. Hornbeck, 128 X 128 Deformable Mirror Device, 30 
IEEE Tran. Elec. Dev. 539 (1983). A great number of the applications described in Hornbeck, supra, use 
DMD's operated in a bistable mode as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,096,279, 
incorporated by reference herein. The details of '279 will be summarized in 
some detail herein, but briefly in the bistable mode of a DMD a deflectable 
beam or mirror may be deflected to one of two landing angles, ±L, by 
underlying electrodes to which an address voltage is applied. At either 
landing angle (±L) an extremity of the deflectable mirror lies in contact with 
an underlying device substrate. Generally, in one orientation, the deflectable 
mirror is "on", bright, or in other words reflecting light in the field of view. 
In the other orientation, the mirror is "off", dark, or not reflecting light in the 
field of view. It has been discovered in prior art DMDs that a possible 
manufacturing defect is that of stuck mirrors. In such an instance, 
individual mirrors may not change between "on" and "off" states in response  
 
to changes in address and bias voltages. As such, the mirrors are always 
"off" or always "on". Always "on" defects or bright defects are particularly 
noticeable and objectionable. The defective pixels stick for a number of 
reasons including but not limited to: a defective adressing element 
underlying the mirror, a poor electrical connection between the mirror and a 
reference voltage, or a surface defect at the point of mirror contact. The present invention is the first to recognize that the defective pixels 
may have characteristics that allow the effects of their defects to be 
mitigated. That is, the invention as defined in claim 1 presents a means of changing a pixel tipped 
in one direction permanently to a pixel that is completely missing, rendered 
non-reflective, partially reflective, or becomes non-deflected in either 
direction. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the 
circuitry used for addressing and biasing mirrors may be employed to effect 
permanent changes upon the defective pixels without destroying 
non-defective pixels. Essentially, a
