<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatic broadcaster for seed and/or fertiliser or the like, with a supply container (1) and a metering device (3) and with individual distributor conduits (9) as well as with shut-off devices (11) assigned to some distributor conduits (9') in order to execute travel-corridor markings or make travel corridors, the distributor conduits (9, 9') opening out in seed coulters (5, 5'), the distributor conduits (9') equipped with the shut-off devices (11) opening out in seed coulters (5') making the travel corridors. In order to ensure in a simple way at least approximately the same quantity is supplied to the seed coulter located at a distance from the travel corridors as when travel corridors are not being made, there is provision for linking or coupling the travel-corridor switching device (15) to the setting device of the metering device (3) in such a way that the metering device (3) is adjusted in such a way that the quantity to be discharged is reduced by a part of the quantity supplied per se to the seed coulters (5') which make travel corridors.

<CLAIMS>
Pneumatic distributing machine for seeds and/or fertilisers or the
like, including a hopper (1) and a central metering means (3), which

communicates with a feed line connected to a blower and leading to a
central distributor head, the individual distribution lines branching-off from

the distributor head, and including shut-off means (11), which are
associated with some distribution lines (9') and actuated by a tramline

circuit arrangement, in order to effect tramline markings or to make
tramlines, the distribution lines (9, 9') terminating in sowing coulters (5,

5'), the distribution lines (9'), provided with, the shut-off means (11),
terminating in the tramline-making sowing coulters (5'), characterised in

that the tramline circuit arrangement (15) is connected or coupled to the
means for setting the metering means (3) in such a manner that the

metering means (3) is adjusted in such a manner that the quantity to be
distributed is reduced by a portion of the quantity which is actually

supplied to the tramline-making sowing coulters (5').
Distributing machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the

metering means is adjusted in such a manner that the quantity to be
distributed is reduced by the quantity of the quantity which is actually

supplied to the tramline-making sowing coulters (5').
Distributing machine according to claim 1, characterised in that a
transmission and/or reduction gear (113) is disposed in the drive of the

metering member (10), and in that this transmission and/or reduction gear 
(113) has, as the transmission ratio, at least approximately the ratio of

"total number of sowing coulters (115) per metering member (10)" to
"total number of sowing coulters (115) per metering member (106) minus

tramline sowing coulters (115') per metering member (106)".
Distributing machine according to claim 3, characterised in that the
transmission and/or reduction gear has an additional transmission step

(112), the transmission ratio of which is 1 : 1.
Distributing machine according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the transmission and/or reduction gear has a

circuit arrangement, and in that the circuit arrangement is coupled to the
tramline circuit arrangement.
Distributing machine according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the distribution lines (116''), determined by a

measuring process to have the greatest seed or fertiliser throughput with
shut-off distribution lines (116'), communicate with the sowing coulters

(117'') situated immediately adjacent the tramline sowing coulters (117').
