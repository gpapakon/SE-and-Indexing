<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mechanism for setting in three positions the "head" section and a section of the base of a studio couch and for folding the parts of this mechanism, characterised in that a member (10) forming part of the base joined, on the one hand by a hinge to a member forming part of the base, and on the other hand by sliding means to a rack (19) on the one end of which pivots on one end of a bracket (17) whose other end is hinge-mounted on a lever (14), hinged to a locking lever (16) pivoting on one end of a swinging member aforementioned (2), a pin (26) projecting laterally out of the bracket (17) and fitting, in the couch position, in a recess (16') formed in the abovementioned locking lever (16) and coming out of it when the member (10) is turned on its hinge.

Mechanism for putting the "head" part and a part of the 
base of a divan bed or sofa-bed into three positions referred 

to as "lying", "sitting" and "relaxing", and for folding back 
the elements of this mechanism, which comprises, laterally, 

two tilting profiled sections (2, 3) pivoted at their bottom 
part on a longitudinal member (1) forming part of the frame 

and connected moreover by pivoting on a connecting profiled 
section (4) in order to form a deformable quadrilateral, the 

ends of the tilting profiled sections (2, 3) being pivoted by 
their top ends on elements which form part of a part of the 

base proper and, on the other hand, of the backrest to be put 
in one of the aforementioned three positions, a profiled 

section (10) forming part of the backrest but capable of being 
lifted to be put into the "relaxing" and "bed" positions and 

connected on the one hand, through a hinge, with a profiled 
section forming part of the base, characterised in that the 

said profiled section (10) is connected on the other hand, 
slidably, to a rack (19), one end of which is pivotally 

connected to an end of a bracket (17), the other end of which 
is mounted, through a hinge, on a lever (14), itself pivoting 

on a locking lever (16) pivotally mounted on one end of an 
aforementioned tilting profiled section (2), a tenon (26) 

projecting laterally out of the bracket (17) in order to be 
housed, in the bed position, in a hollow (16') formed in the 

aforementioned locking lever (16) and to be extracted 
therefrom when the profiled section (10) is folded back.
