<ABSTRACT>
A catheter introducer set (2) is disclosed. The device 
comprises a cannula (10) for insertion into a blood vessel, a 

tube (6) in fluid communication with the cannula and a needle 
for assisting in the introduction of the cannula into the 

vessel. Between the cannula (10) and the tube (6) is an 
intermediate member (8) which allows the needle to be gripped 

so that it can be inserted into the blood vessel. The 
intermediate member preferably has a pair of wings (14, 14') 

to facilitate the gripping of the needle. The needle has an 
opening or openings in it to allow a user to observe blood 

flashback during insertion of the needle into the blood 
vessel. The intermediate member (8) is made of polyurethane 

and is provided with a groove (13) to facilitate the gripping 
of the needle. The wings have ramps (52, 52') on them to 

facilitate the gripping of the needle. Ribs (53, 53') are 
also provided between the ramp and the intermediate member to 

facilitate gripping. The wings (14, 14') describe an angle of 
less than 180 degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of medical catheters. In 
particular it relates to a catheter for providing access to a blood vessel and the 
like and having features which facilitate its introduction into the vessel. Winged infusion sets are commonly used by the medical profession for the 
infusion of medication and the drawing of fluids from vessels. A species of such 
devices (a "scalp vein set") may comprise a needle with wings attached to it. 
Attached to the needle, and in fluid communication with the needle bore is a 
translucent tube through which medication can be infused or fluids drawn. 
Another species (a winged catheter introducer), comprises a flexible cannula 
attached to a winged member and a translucent tube. Inside the cannula is a 
needle with a wire attached to it. The needle aids in the insertion of the catheter 
into a vessel and is withdrawn by pulling the wire once the cannula has been 
successfully introduced into the vessel. Such devices are introduced into the vessel as follows: The wings are 
gripped between the practitioner's forefinger and thumb. The practitioner uses 
the needle to pierce the skin in the vicinity of the vessel to which access is 
desired. When the vessel is penetrated, the pressure in the vessel will cause 
blood to flow up the needle bore and into the translucent tubing. The practitioner 
verifies the penetration of the vessel by looking for blood "flashback" in the 
tubing. Once the device is satisfactorily positioned in the vessel it may be left 
there for some time. In the case of a winged catheter introducer, the needle is 
withdrawn from the cannula. A device of the second species is shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,177,809 
and 5,163,913. Such devices are  
 
sold under the trademarks Intima™ and Angioset® by Becton Dickinson & Co. 
of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. More specifically, the present invention relates to a catheter introducer set according to 
the preamble of Claim 1, which is known from WO 83/00019. The invention is a catheter introducer set having the features of Claim 1. 
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, such a 
device is made up of a first tube which has a bore, and a cannula for insertion 
into a vessel. The cannula also has a bore which is in fluid communication with 
the bore of the first tube. An intermediate member is secured between the first 
tube and the cannula. A needle having a lumen defined by a cylindrical wall, a 
first end and a second sharp end is slidably mountable lengthwise in the first

<CLAIMS>
A catheter introducer set (2) comprising: 

a first tube (6), the first tube having a first bore (6b) and permitting 
blood therein to be observed, in use; 
a cannula (10) for insertion into a vessel, the cannula (10) having a second 
bore (10b) in fluid communication with the first bore (6b); 
an intermediate member (8) secured between the first tube (6) and the 
cannula (10); 
a needle (16) having a lumen (17) defined by a cylindrical wall (44), a first end (35) and a 
second sharp end (34), the needle (16) being slidably mountable lengthwise in the first 

tube (6) and the cannula (10) so that it lies in the first (6b) and second (10b) bores, 
the needle (16) 

comprising first (36), second (40) and intermediate (38) regions, such that 
when the needle (16) is 

mounted lengthwise in the first tube (6) and the cannula (10) 
with the sharp end (34) 

protruding from the cannula (10), the first (36), second (40) 
and intermediate (38) regions of the 

needle (16) general align respectively with the first tube (6), cannula (10) and intermediate 
member (8) and an annular space is defined between the needle (16) and the first 

bore 6b,
 
   wherein the intermediate member (8) comprises gripping means (14, 14') for selectively 

gripping the needle, 
characterised in that: 


an annular space (30) is defined between the needle (16) and the second 
bore (10b), whereby, when gripping the needle (16), said gripping means (14, 14') 

inhibits fluid flow through the annular space (30), and 
the cylindrical wall (44) of the needle (16) is provided with an opening (18) 
in the first region (36) such that fluid can be communicated from the needle lumen (17) 

through the opening (18) and into the annular space (30) within the first bore (6b).
