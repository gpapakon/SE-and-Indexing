<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel nitrile 
and aldoxime indane compounds and compositions and to 
processes for their preparation. The nitrile indane 
compounds and compositions of the invention have a 
fragrant musk-like aroma. Musk fragrances are in great demand for use in 
various products such as in perfumes, colognes, 
cosmetics, soaps and others. However, natural musk, 
which is obtained from the Asian musk deer, is extremely 
scarce and is quite expensive. Accordingly, fragrance 
chemists have spent considerable time searching for 
synthetic products which duplicate or closely simulate 
this natural musk scent. 
As a result of these research efforts, a number of 
different synthetic musks have been discovered. Among 
such synthetic compounds are the acetyl indanes described 
by U.S. Patent No. 4,466,908, compounds of the formulas 
 
which may be employed, if desired, in combination with 
acetyl tetrahydronaphthalenes of the formula  
 
 
Similarly, Fehr et all, Helvetica Chimica Acta, Vol. 72, 
pp. 1537-1553 (1989) discusses such synthetic musks as 
those of the formula 
 
wherein R is either H or CH3. U.S. Patent No. 4,352,748 discloses formylated 
and acetylated indane musks, including those of the 
formulas 
Other acetyl indanes, such as 6-acetyl-1,1,3,3,5-pentamethylindane, 
5-acetyl-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethylindane 
and 6-acetyl-5-ethyl-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethylindane, are 
disclosed in French Patent No. 1,392,804 (as reported in 
Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 63, p. 1681d (1965)). European Patent Publication 0 301 375 A2 
describes formylated tetralins, such as 1,1,2,4,4-pentamethyl-6-formyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, 
and 
their utility as synthetic musks. Teyssi√© and Smets, J. Am. Chem. Soc.77, 6695 
(1955), describe the laboratory synthesis of 1,1,3,3,4,6-hexamethylindan 
by intramolecular cyclization of 
4-methyl-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-2-methyl-pentene-1. EP-A-0487319, which is comprised in the state of 
the art by virtue of Article 54(3) EPC, discloses the 
compound 5-formyl-1,1,2,3,3,4,6-heptamethylindan and a 
process for its preparation from 1,1,2,3,3,4,6-heptamethylindan. Certain synthetic nitrile indane and tetralin 
compounds having musk aroma properties have also been 
described in the literature. For example, De Simone, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,018,719, discusses the nitrile indane 
musk compound 1,1,2,3,3,5-hexamethylindane-6-nitrile, a 
compound of the formula 
 
Christenson et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,483,786 describes 
the nitrile tetralin musk compounds
