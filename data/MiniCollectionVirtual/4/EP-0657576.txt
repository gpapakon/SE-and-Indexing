<ABSTRACT>
To avoid a spinning cycle during the presence of braking foam in the tub, it is proposed to supply to the control circuit of the washing machine during a spinning phase a signal which is a measure of an undesirable braking of the laundry drum (for example, as a result of foam formation) and which is determined by the ratio of the following parameters of the operation of the drive motor to one another:     a) desired speed   b) actual speed and   c) a load-dependent electrical variable.   As a result, reliable foam recognition is guaranteed and the elimination of foam is possible.

Method for ascertaining an undesired braking of the laundry drum during a spinning

section in an automatically controlled washing machine with a drive motor, the rotational
speed of which is settable by a rotational speed regulating circuit and is ascertainable in

terms of target and actual rotational speed values and which serves for the drive of the
laundry drum at several different rotational speeds for the washing, rinsing and spinning,

characterised in that the control circuit of the washing machine has a signal fed to it during
a spinning period, which signal is a measure of an undesired braking of the laundry drum

and determined from the relationship to each other of the following parameters of the drive
motor operation:


a) target rotational speed,
b) actual rotational speed and
c) an electrical magnitude dependent on load.
Method with a rotational speed regulating circuit based on a phase-gating control,
according to claim 1, characterised in that the electrical magnitude dependent on load is

the phase-gating angle of the supply voltage of the drive motor.
Method with a rotational speed regulating circuit based on a chopper control,
according to claim 1, characterised in that the electrical magnitude dependent on load is

the current consumption of the drive motor.
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the spinning drive of the
drum is switched off for at least a limited duration in the presence of the signal with a

magnitude which permits the presence of a quantity of foam braking the drum to be
deduced.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that a washing solution pump
continues to be driven whilst the spinning drive is switched off.
Method according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the drum is driven in
reversing manner in overdrive whilst the spinning drive is switched off. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in that at least one
further rinsing run is initiated after ascertaining a braking quantity of foam.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that the rinsing run and/or further
rinsing runs are carried out with a higher washing solution level.
Method according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the number of attempts to
start spinning is stored in an arrangement of the control circuit and a number of rinsing

runs, which corresponds with the empirical value learned from certain frequencies of
numbers of that kind, is for future treatment processes either added in advance to the

number of rinsing runs, which is already installed at the manufacture, or installed before
the next attempt to start spinning.
