<ABSTRACT>
Plant operating conditions 1, apparatus operating 
conditions 2 and environment conditions 3 are accumulated, 

combined and put together as a set of plant status variables 
8 through a monitor 6, while water chemistry information 

4 is accumulated as another set of plant status variables 
9. The set of status variables 8 is updated and the 

past data are accumulated in the set of status variables 9. 
Periodical inspection data 5 are also accumulated in the 

set of status variables 9 along with the water chemistry 
information 4. The set 9 is compressed and stored as a 

plant chart 11 such as a personal clinical chart. A status 
variable prediction 12 is performed in consideration of the 

personality of a plant. Both data of the sets 8 and 10 are 
compared with each other by comparison means 13. If both 

the data nearly coincide with each other, the plant is 
diagnosed to be normal and, if not, it is diagnosed to be 

abnormal. When the plant is diagnosed to be abnormal, an 
abnormal apparatus and an abnormal factor are identified.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a monitoring and 
diagnosing method of the 
condition and operation of plants such as nuclear power 
plants and thermoelectric power plants. There are various kinds of plants for producing energy 
and reaction products, e.g., nuclear power plants such as 
using boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors, 
thermoelectric power plants in which petroleum, coal, 
natural gas, etc. are burnt, and chemical plants for producing 
and refining petrochemicals such as ethylene (hereinafter 
these different types of plants referred to simply 
together as plants). In these plants, objects to be controlled 
in the plants are subject to a wide temperature 
range from low to high temperatures, and phase of the 
objects is changed from liquid to gas phase and, in some 
cases, even to solid phase at different locations within 
each plant. For each condition of start-up, steady operation and 
shut-down of a plant, the temperature and phase of the 
controlled object are variously changed at different locations 
within the plant. Generally, the operation of a 
plant is controlled by a computer. In order to achieve  
 
optimum operation efficiency of the plant or smooth start-up 
and shut-down thereof, various variables in the plant 
such as pressure and temperature are measured every moment, 
and the plant is operated under control of the computer so 
that the various variables are optimized. Fig. 16 is a schematic structural view of main apparatus 
and equipment of a nuclear power plant using a boiling 
water reactor. In Fig. 16, reactor internals such as a fuel assembly 
and a jet pump 22 are disposed in a pressure vessel 17. 
The pressure vessel 17 is housed in a reactor containment 
vessel 16 along with other main apparatus and equipment for 
controlling and cooling the reactor, such as a control rod 
drive unit and a recirculation pump motor 29. During normal operation, control rods are withdrawn 
from of a core 23 so that nuclear fission of uranium as 
fuel reaches critical to produce heat. The jet pump 22 is 
driven by the recirculation pump motor 29 disposed in a 
recirculation loop 26, whereby cooling water is circulated 
to remove the heat generated with the nuclear fission from 
the core. Then, high-pressure steam at 280 Â°C and 6.9 MPa 
is produced and supplied to a turbine through a main steam 
line 24 for driving the turbine to thereby generate electricity. 
The steam is condensed by a condenser into water 
that is returned to the reactor through a feed-water line 
25.
