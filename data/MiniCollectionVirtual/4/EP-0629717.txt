<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and process for cleaning, particularly degreasing, electrically conducting materials (9), for example metallic and/or ceramic turnings and/or grinding sludges under vacuum conditions, consisting essentially of a container (vessel) (4) for receiving the materials (9) to be treated and at least two electrodes (4, 5) which are connected to a power supply unit (8). The materials (9) to be treated can be heated by the direct passage of current by means of the two electrodes (4, 5).
