<CLAIMS>
A method of treating optical elements of
transparent plastics material, consisting in subjecting

the surface of each optical element to ultraviolet
radiation before depositing a protective coating

thereon, characterised in that the ultraviolet
radiation is emitted by electrodeless lamps which are

energised by subjecting them to the action of
microwaves generated by a magnetron.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the said optical elements are made of

polycarbonate.
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the said ultraviolet radiation

has an emission spectrum in which wavelengths greater
than 280 nm predominate.
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in
that more than 50% of the energy emitted corresponds to

wavelengths in the range between 280 and 380 nm.
A method according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the optical elements are

placed on the carpet of a conveyor arranged to pass,
via an entry screen and an exit screen, through a

tunnel, the roof of which is furnished with a battery
of the said lamps. 
A method according to Claim 5, characterised in
that the said lamps are located at the focus of an

elliptical reflector.
A method according to Claim 5 or Claim 6,
characterised in that the magnetron is located outside

the tunnel.
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in
that the number of lamps energised, the orientation of

the reflectors, the intensity of the ultraviolet
radiation, and the speed of travel of the carpet of the

conveyor are regulated in such a way that the energy
received by the said optical elements is in the range

between 2 and 14 J/cm
