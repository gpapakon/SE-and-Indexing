<ABSTRACT>
Oscillation damper for use on the outer periphery of a shaft (1) rotating about an axis and connecting two widened portions (6). The oscillation damper comprises half shells (2) which can be pressed against the outer periphery of the shaft (1) and are connected by spring elements (3), deformable in the peripheral direction, of at least two inertial masses (4) designed like circle segments, the inertial masses (4) being connected to one another by holding elements. The inertial masses (4) are connected in a hinged manner by joint elements (5) and can be locked in an annular form by at least one closure element (7).

<CLAIMS>
A vibration damper for use on the outside 
circumference of a shaft (1) which rotates about an axis and 

has thickenings (6) at the ends, comprising a rubber spring 
element (3) which can be deformed in the circumferential 

direction and has at least two inertia masses (4), 
configured in the manner of segments of a circle, and an 

attachment device which connects the inertia masses (4) to 
one another, the attachment device comprising at least one 

joint (5), which connects the inertia masses (4) in such a 
way that they can be pivoted apart, and comprising a closure 

element (7) by means of which the inertia masses (4) can be 
maintained in a state joined together in a ring-like manner, 

characterized in that at least two semi-shells (2) are 
provided, which can be pressed against the outside 

circumference of the shaft (1) and are connected in each 
case by the rubber spring element (3) with the at least two 

inertia masses (4), and in that the joint (5) is composed of 
a projection of the one inertia mass (4), which projection 

protrudes in the circumferential direction and engages in a 
correspondingly designed groove in the other inertia mass 

(4) in such a way that the two inertia masses (4) are 
captively connected to one another in the non-assembled 

state. 
A vibration damper according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the joint (5) is formed by a hinge. 
A vibration damper according to either of claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the closure element (7) is 

composed of a clip which engages in the radial direction 
around the outside of outwardly projecting shoulders (8) of 

the inertia masses (4) to be connected.  
 
A vibration damper according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the clip (7) and the shoulders (8) have 

undercuts (9) which engage in one another. 
A vibration damper according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the undercuts (9) extend substantially 

parallel to the axis of the vibration damper. 
A vibration damper according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the clip (7) can be bent open in a 

flexible manner. 
A vibration damper according to any one of claims 
3 to 6, characterized in that the clip (7) is recessed 

into the outside circumference of the inertia masses (4) 
so as to be flush with the surface. 
A vibration damper according to any one of claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the spring elements (3) are 

connected by means of at least one spring tongue (11) 
arranged in the region of the joint (5), and in that the 

inertia masses (4) can be pressed against one another by 
the spring tongue (11). 
A vibration damper according to claim 8, characterized 
in that the spring tongue (11) and the spring 

elements (3) are designed to merge integrally into one 
another.
