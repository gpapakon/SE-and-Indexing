<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of liquid amine adducts of sulphonamides containing fluorinated groups, in which the compounds are synthesized by the simultaneous reaction between a sulphonyl halide which contains fluorinated groups, a tertiary amine and ammonia or a primary amine in the absence of solvents.
