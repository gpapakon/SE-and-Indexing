<ABSTRACT>
A novel anti-active-oxygen agent which inhibits the generation of active oxygen species, is highly safe, can 
be preparated at a rather low cost, and contains an amino acid derivative represented by general formula (I) or a salt 

thereof as the active ingredient, wherein Ar represents 2-hydroxyphenyl, 
2-hdyroxyl-1-naphthyl or pyridyl provided 

that the aromatic rings of these groups may be substituted by halogen, alkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, nitro, alkoxy or 
carboxy; R represents the side chain of an amino acid; X represents -CH₂-NH- or -CH=N-; Y represents hydrogen, 

-COOR¹, -SO₃H, -CON(R²)R³, -CONHCH(R⁵)COOR⁴ or -CH₂OH, wherein R¹ to R⁴ represent each hydrogen or 
alkyl, and R⁵ represents the side chain of an amino acid; and n represents an integer of 0 or 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel anti-active oxygen
agents, and more specifically to anti-active oxygen agents
which inhibit the generation of active oxygen and thus
produce desired effects including preventive activities
against skin-aging or other diseases.In recent years, various disorders and diseases caused
by active oxygen species such as superoxide anion radical
(O2-), hydroxyl radical (·OH), singlet oxygen (1O2), and
peroxide lipid have been reported. It is known that active
oxygen species are deeply implicated as a cause in aging,
canceration, pigmentation, inflammation or other skin
disorders induced by the solar rays, particularly UV rays.
The implication of active oxygen species in disorders and
diseases in living bodies other than skin has also been
explained. For example, active oxgen species derived from
molecular oxygens added into ischemic tissues by blood
reperfusion play an important role in ischemic reperfusion-induced
disorders in organs such as heart, enteron, gaster,
liver, kidney, and brain. Similarly, active oxygen species
generated in living bodies bring about, for example, a wide
variety of disorders and diseases such as inflammation,
rheumatism, aging, cancer, arteriosclerosis, digestive
diseases, kidney diseases, endocrine disorders, lung 
diseases, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation
syndrome, etc. It has been also reported that active oxygen
species are responsible for denaturation and deterioration
caused by oxidation of fats and oils in foods.If the action of active oxygen species in such a wide
range including living organs such as skin and foods could
be inhibited, these disorders and diseases as well as
denaturation and deterioration of foods would be prevented.Known agents inhibiting the action of active oxygen
species include enzyme-based anti-oxidants such as
superoxide dismutase (SOD); non-enzyme-based anti-oxidants
such as ascorbic acid, tocopherol and glutathione; and
vegetable-derived anti-oxidant such as tannin. Recently,
some attempts have been reported to inhibit the generation
of active oxygen species by capture of metal ions, in view
of the fact that metal ions present in living bodies
function as catalyst in the generation of active oxygen
species (For example, see "Free Radicals in Biology and
Medicine", Oxford, Clarendon Press, p. 234, 1989).Among known agents which inhibit the action of active
oxygen species, SOD is limited in use because of its high
costs and instability. Many of non-enzyme-based anti-oxydants
such as ascorbic acid,
