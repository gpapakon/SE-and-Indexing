<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sighting device (aiming device) which contains a magnifying aiming telescope as the first sighting appliance. According to the invention, this sighting appliance, which is suitable for aimed firing, is supplemented by a further sighting appliance for rapid firing. This additional sighting appliance is an optical reflex sight which images a marker into the eye of the person using the sight and has a separate optical beam path, which is distinct from the aiming telescope. This reflex sight makes it possible to aim using one eye, it being possible for the other eye to remain open.

Sighting apparatus containing a magnifying riflescope as a first sighting device
and characterized by the fact that such sighting apparatus (1, 31) contains an

additional, second sighting device (3, 29, 50) which images a mark in the user's
eye and features a separate optical beam path.
Sighting apparatus of claim 1, wherein the optical axis (3a, 34, 55) of the second
sighting device (3, 29, 50) and the optical axis (2a) of a magnifying monocular

riflescope (2) are located in a plane, in which the barrel axis (4a) of a firearm (4).is
also located, respectively in the case of a firearm with parallel barrel axes, the

plane of the optical axes (2a, 3a) should be perpendicular to the plane of the
barrel axes and should be located between them.
Sighting apparatus of claim 2, wherein the magnifying riflescope (2) is located
between the firearm (4) and the second sighting device (3, 29, 50).
Sighting apparatus of claims 1 to 3, wherein the second sighting device (3, 29, 50)
contains optical components (6, 7, 30, 31, 52, 57) which, in their combination,

provide an unmagnified image for a specific spectral range.
Sighting apparatus of claims 1 to 4, wherein the second sighting device (3, 29, 50)
comprises as a minimum an enclosed housing (46), an illumination system (10,

35, 51) with a light source (10a, 10b, 35a, 35b) installed in the housing (46), an
optically transparent housing cover (7, 31, 52) with a partially reflective coating (8,

32, 53) installed at the objective end and not altering the angular opening of a
cone of light, a pinhole (9, 37, 56) installed in front of the illumination system (10,

35, 51) and permitting the light of the illumination system (10, 35, 51) to pass
along the optical axis (3a, 34, 55) in the direction of the housing cover (7, 31, 52)

at the objective end, and a second optically transparent housing cover (6, 30, 57)
installed at the eyepiece end, wherein the light of the illumination system (10, 35,

51) which passes through the pinhole (9, 37, 56) being in the optical axis (3a, 34,
55) of the second sighting device (3, 29, 50) being reflected at the partially

reflective coating (8, 31, 53) and being imaged through the housing cover at the 
eyepiece end (6, 30, 57) in the user's eye.
Sighting apparatus of claim 5, wherein the illumination system (10, 35) is installed
in the second sighting device (3, 29) in such a way that its light is obliquely

directed to the housing cover (7, 31) installed at the objective end.
Sighting apparatus of claim 5 or 6, wherein the housing cover (7, 31, 52) installed
at the objective end consists of two transparent lenses (7a, 7b, 31a, 31b, 52a,

52b) and is tilted relative to the optical axis of the second sighting device (3, 29,
50), wherein the first, external lens (7a, 31a, 52a) features a flat outer surface

(31a') and a concave inner surface (31a") in the viewing direction, and the second,
internal lens (7b, 31b, 52b) features a flat inner surface (31b') and a convex outer

surface (31b") in the viewing direction, with the radius of the concave first lens
surface (31a") being identical with that of the convex second lens surface (31b")

and with a partially reflecting coating (8, 32, 53) being provided between these two
surfaces (31a", 31b") of the lenses (7a, 7b, 31a, 31b).
Sighting apparatus of claim 7, wherein the partially reflecting coating (8, 32, 53) is
a cut-off filter.
Sighting apparatus of one of the claims 5 to 8, wherein the illumination system
(10, 35, 51) of 
the second sighting device (3, 29, 50) contains a light source (10a,
35a) of luminescent material, and wherein the luminescent material (10a, 35a)

emitting light in a limited spectral range is installed in the housing of the second
sighting device (3, 29, 50) in such a way that it can be irradiated by natural light

(e.g. daylight).
Sighting apparatus of claim 9, wherein the luminescent material (10a, 35a) in the
illumination system (10, 35, 51) can be alternatively irradiated by natural light (e.g.

daylight) and/or by an electrical light source (10b, 35b).
Sighting apparatus of claim 10, wherein the power supply of the electrical light
source (10b, 35b) contains a photosensitive element (3b, 29a, 43) which

measures the intensity of natural light (e.g. daylight) and reduces the illumination 
level of the electrical light source (10b, 35b) in accordance with the decrease in

the intensity of natural light, down to a minimum.
Sighting apparatus of claim 10 or 11, wherein the electrical light source (10b,
35b) is a LED emitting light in the red spectral range.
Sighting apparatus of claims 10 to 12, wherein the luminescent material (10a,
