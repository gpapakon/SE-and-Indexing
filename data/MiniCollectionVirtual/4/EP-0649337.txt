<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the removal of sulphur dioxide from waste gases which process comprises contacting a waste gas containing sulphur dioxide with an aqueous solution containing sulphuric acid, hydrogen bromide and bromide to form sulphuric acid and hydrogen bromide; catalytically oxidising in the vapour phase the hydrogen bromide formed to bromine and thereafter recycling the bromine to the first step of the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the removal of sulphur dioxide from waste gases which 
includes the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen bromide 
as an intermediate step and the formation of sulphuric 
acid as a useful end product. The invention is based in the well-known 
reaction of bromine with sulphur dioxide to form 
sulphuric acid and hydrobromic acid: 
Br2 + SO2 + 2H2O → 2HBr + H2SO4The desulphurisation is carried out by 
contacting the waste gases with an aqueous solution 
containing both acids and a small quantity of 
bromine. During the reaction, the two acids are 
produced simultaneously in the solution. Subsequently, the acids are separated from the 
solution in such a way that hydrogen bromide is 
evaporated, brought in contact with an excess of 
oxygen (air) and catalytically oxidized to bromine 
according to the following reaction: 
4HBr + O2 → 2Br2 + 2H2OIn this way, the consumed bromine is completely 
recycled and the overall reaction of the process is 
the formation of sulphuric acid from sulphur dioxide 
according to the following reaction: 
2SO2 + 2H2O + O2 → 2H2SO4The single steps of the process are all 
well-known reactions, but have never before been 
combined in a single process.  
 Known wet regenerative flue gas desulphurisation 
processes include the process which is known as the 
Ispra Mark 13A process which is based on the above 
reaction (1). In this process, the regeneration of the 
consumed bromine is carried out by electrolysis of the 
hydrogen bromide. Aspects of this process are 
discussed in EP-A-0016290 and EP-A-0171570. The 
process has been successfully developed to a large 
pilot plant scale and extensive market studies and 
comparative cost estimations have been carried out. During these studies it appeared that the 
investment and operation costs of the electrolyzer 
would be very high. As an example, it was estimated 
that in case of a 500 MW power station operating with 
coal containing 2 wt% of sulphur, the electrolyzer 
represents about 25% of the total investment costs and 
about 30% of the viable operating costs. Alternatives to the electrolysis step have been 
investigated, but, until now could not be realized. 
For example, catalytic oxidation of hydrogen bromide 
in the gas phase with oxygen present in the flue gas 
is not feasible due to the presence of sulphur 
dioxide. The eventually formed bromine will react 
directly with SO2 to SO3 and subsequently to 
H2SO4 in the vapour phase. This will give rise to 
the formation of an excessive
