<ABSTRACT>
Electrochemical cell consisting of an O2- anion conductor solid electrolyte in contact with an anode and cathode of identical or different composition. Said electrolyte consists of a composition derived from Bi4V2O11, one at least of the constitutive cationic elements being substituted by at least one substituent element chosen so that the structural type of the Bi4V2O11 gamma phase is maintained together with the balance of charges. Either the anode or the cathode comprises two parts, a first part being made of a mixed electronic and ionic conducting material in contact with the solid electrolyte, the second part being made of an electronic conducting material and placed over the first part. The invention also concerns the use of the electrochemical cell for oxygen separation or extraction.
