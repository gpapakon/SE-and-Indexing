<ABSTRACT>
Monitoring a catalyst (14) positioned downstream of a 
Y-shaped exhaust path includes positioning a first exhaust 

gas oxygen sensor (18) just upstream and a second exhaust 
gas oxygen sensor (19) just downstream of the catalyst (14) 

and using the two sensors (18, 19) together to monitor 
catalyst activity. Such monitoring is discontinued when the 

exhaust gas oxygen sensor switching rate of the upstream 
exhaust gas oxygen sensor (18) is below a minimum threshold 

value. The upstream exhaust gas oxygen sensor (18) does not 
provide an air fuel ratio feedback signal but instead, such 

a signal is provided by two additional exhaust gas oxygen 
sensors (16, 17), one sensor being positioned in each of the 

two legs of the Y exhaust path coming from the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic engine control 
and diagnostics for an internal combustion engine. Internal combustion engines can have a catalyst in 
the exhaust path to reduce the occurrence of certain gases 
coming out of the exhaust path. Often it is desirable to 
confirm proper operation of such catalysts. A known onboard 
catalyst monitor method uses an engine heated exhaust gas 
oxygen (HEGO) sensor before the catalyst and a catalyst 
monitor HEGO sensor after the catalyst. The ratio of HEGO 
switches (rear/front) is related to the catalyst hydrocarbon 
(HC) efficiency. Further, the front HEGO sensor is used as 
a feedback element in a feedback air fuel ratio control 
system. Such catalyst monitoring is done in a relatively 
straight forward manner when an engine has a single exhaust 
pipe coming out to a catalyst. With a Y pipe exhaust 
configuration on a V block engine, this straight forward 
monitoring has drawbacks because a single HEGO sensor just 
forward of the catalyst is exposed to output gases from each 
leg of the Y-exhaust output coming from the two banks of the 
V block engine. Thus, this HEGO sensor may experience the 
following three inputs. First, the air/fuel ratio of the 
gas from the two legs of the Y can be out of phase 
(particularly if the legs are unequal length) so that the 
air/fuel perturbation will be cancelled out at the entrance 
to the catalyst. Second, the air/fuel ratio of the gas from 
the two legs of the Y can be in phase so that the air/fuel 
perturbation will be reinforced at the entrance to the 
catalyst. Third, the air/fuel ratio entering the catalyst 
could consist of an air/fuel ratio in between the previous 
first and second extreme cases. Thus this HEGO is no longer effective as a feedback 
element for controlling an air fuel ratio feedback control 
system. Further, this HEGO element is not effective in  
 
acting together with the rear HEGO in order to monitor the 
operation of the catalyst. There is no known way to monitor 
the catalyst downstream of a Y pipe exhaust connection. In 
such a system, the HEGO sensors used for controlling 
air/fuel ratio were in the left and right exhaust manifolds 
or exhaust pipes. It would be desirable to have a monitor 
for a catalyst used with a Y-pipe exhaust configuration. A catalyst monitor method in accordance with an 
embodiment of this invention applied to a Y shaped exhaust 
gas configuration has one HEGO sensor located in each of the 
Y-legs upstream of the position where the two legs join so 
as to detect
