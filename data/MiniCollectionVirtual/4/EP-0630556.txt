<CLAIMS>
Milking device having a teat cup cluster arm (1) for
positioning and holding a milking unit (2) in a milking

position during milking, and having an adjustment device
(3), by means of which the tensile forces and/or retention

forces (F1, F2), which are applied to the udder (7) by the
milking unit (2), are individually adjustable during

milking, 
characterised in that
 the change of the tensile
forces or retention forces (F1, F2) is achieved by changing

the lever length (K) of the functional forces which act on
the teat cup cluster arm.
Method for operating a milking device having a teat cup
cluster arm (1) for positioning and holding a milking unit

(2), the tensile forces and/or retention forces (F1, F2),
which are to be applied by the teat cup cluster arm (1),

being adjusted depending on the animal to be milked by means
of an adjustment device (3), even during the milking operation,


characterised in that
 the tensile forces or retention
forces (F1, F2) for each animal are controlled individually

depending on the lactation stage and/or lactation age.
Method according to patent claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the tensile forces or retention forces are controlled
depending on the progression of the milk curve.
method according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that

the change of the tensile forces or retention forces (F1,
F2) is effected gradually.
Method according to any one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised
in that
 the individual values of the tensile forces
or retention forces (F1, F2) for each animal can preferably 

be stored by means of electronic data processing and are
automatically taken into consideration when an animal is

identified.
Method according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised
in that
 the teat cup cluster arm (1) is automatically
removed from the udder once the milking operation has

ended.
Milking device having a teat cup cluster arm according
to claim 1, 
characterised by
 a tension spring (4), wherein
the articulation point can be changed by means of a rocking

movement with preferably two end stops in order to change
the tensile forces or the retention forces (F1, F2).
Milking device having a teat cup cluster arm according
to claim 1 or 7, 
characterised in that
 the disconnecting
apparatus (5) of the discharge milk hose (6), which apparatus

(5) is necessary for automatically removing the teat cup
cluster (2), is fitted directly to the teat cup cluster arm

(1).
