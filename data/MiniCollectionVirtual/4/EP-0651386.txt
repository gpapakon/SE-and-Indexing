<ABSTRACT>
A cassette loading mechanism for a tape cassette player can be simplified in 
arrangement and carry out automatic loading operation reliably. A cassette housing 

(2) into which a tape cassette is inserted and held is supported to a mechanical 
chassis (1) by a housing hanger (3) so that the cassette housing (2) can be elevated 

and lowered freely. The housing hanger (3) is rotated in the upper direction by a 
loading operation member composed of first and second loading levers (10, 11) 

and a loading arm (14) to thereby elevate and lower the cassette housing (2). Also, 
a catcher member (5) is slid in the front and rear direction relative to the cassette 

housing (2) by rotating a pull-in lever (8) having the catcher member (5) engaged 
with hub apertures of the tape cassette.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tape cassette players and, particularly to a
tape cassette automatic loading apparatus capable of automatically loading a tape
cassette on a tape cassette player.Cassette players, particularly, car tape cassette players that have hitherto
been proposed include an automatic loading apparatus in which a tape cassette is
automatically pulled into and loaded on a tape cassette player when the tape
cassette is inserted into a cassette mouth.U.S. Patent No. 4,638,386 describes an automatic loading apparatus for
automatically loading a tape cassette by operating a loading cam gear either by a
trigger, such as a plunger or the like or by a movement of a swinging gear under a
driving force of a main motor that rotates hub drive shafts, capstans or the like.The above-mentioned automatic loading apparatus for the tape cassette
player becomes complicated from a mechanism standpoint. Also, in this
previously-proposed automatic loading apparatus, the tape cassette tends to be
pulled in, ejected, elevated or lowered with a delay of timing. There is then the
defect that the automatic loading apparatus becomes unable to load and/or eject the
tape cassette.U.S. Patent No. 4,723,236 is used for the delimitation of appended claim 1 and describes an automatic loading apparatus which
includes a control motor exclusively-designed for an automatic loading apparatus.
In this example of the previously-proposed automatic loading apparatus, a cassette
housing for loading and accommodating a tape cassette is engaged with and/or
disengaged from the hub drive shafts, the capstans or the like by directly elevating
and/or lowering the tape cassette through a guide cam groove formed in an
intermediate disc. Therefore, when an external force is applied to the cassette
housing in which the tape cassette is loaded and accommodated, the external force
is directly applied to an engagement portion composed of a sliding plate and a
guide cam opening. The engagement portion has stiffness and the cassette housing
and the sliding plate are deformed unavoidably. There is then the risk that the
automatic loading apparatus becomes unable to load the tape cassette.In view of the aforesaid aspects, it is an object of the present invention to
provide a loading apparatus for a tape cassette which can be simplified in
mechanism. It is another object of the present invention to provide a tape cassette player
in which a cassette housing can be prevented from being deformed even when an
external force is applied to the

<CLAIMS>
An operation changing mechanism for a tape cassette player comprising:

a cassette housing (2) supported to a mechanical chassis (1) and which can
be elevated and lowered among a cassette loading position, a cassette eject

position and a cassette playing position;
a housing hanger (3) supported to said mechanical chassis (1) to cause said
cassette housing (2) to be elevated and lowered;
a loading operation member (10, 11) being driven by a control motor (22);

characterised by

   an operating member (14,15a,15b) for converting driving operation of said loading
operation member (10, 11) to rotation operation of said housing hanger (3),

wherein said operating member includes a first support shaft (15a) movably
engaged with a vertically-elongated opening (16) defined on said mechanical

chassis (1) and a second support shaft (15b) engaged with an operation cam
opening (11c) defined on said loading operation member (10, 11), said first support

shaft (15a) is biased so as to be engaged with an upper end of said elongated
opening (16) defined on said mechanical chassis (1) under spring force, and said

first support shaft (15a) is rotated about said second support shaft (15b) against
said spring force when a downward external force is applied to said cassette

housing (2) placed at said cassette loading position or said cassette eject position.
An operation changing mechanism according to claim 1, wherein said
second support shaft (15b) is rotated about said first support shaft (15a) by said

operation cam opening (11c) when said loading operation member (10, 11) is
driven by said control motor (22).
An operation changing mechanism according to claim 1, wherein said
loading operation member comprises a first loading lever (10) engaged with said

operating member (14) and a second loading lever (11) engaged with said
operating member (14) and to which rotation of said control motor (22) is

transmitted, and a spring member (13) is extended between said first and second
loading levers (10, 11).
