<ABSTRACT>
Compositions enriched with natural phyto-oestrogens or analogues thereof selected from Genistein, Daidzein, Formononetin and Biochanin A. These may be used as food additives, tablets or capsules for promoting health in cases of cancer, pre-menstrual syndrome, menopause or hypercholesterolaemia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medicaments containing phyto-oestrogens, or phyto-oestrogen
metabolites used to treat pre-menstrual syndrome, menopausal symptoms, or prostate cancer.The medicaments for use in accordance with the invention are made from extracts of certain plants with the
particular purpose of enrichment for phyto-oestrogens, both in their natural state and their
closely related derivatives and metabolites.Plants which are used as foodstuffs or medicinal herbs contain a wide variety of chemicals
which are assimilated into the body following ingestion. Some of these chemicals are
important nutrients for man and animals (eg. fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals)
while others have none, or little or no known nutritional value. The phyto-oestrogens hitherto
have fallen into this latter category of no known nutritional value.There are 3 principal classes of phyto-oestrogens, viz. isoflavones, lignans, and coumestans.
The isoflavones are thought to have a broad range of biological functions in plants, although
these are poorly understood. However, two particular functions are recognised - (a) as phyto-alexin
or stressor chemicals which are secreted by the plant in response to attack by parasites
such as insects, fungi, viruses, etc and which display activity against these parasites, and (b)
chemicals which encourage colonisation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria on the roots of legumes.
The biological functions in plants of the lignans and coumestans is not generally understood.The different types of phyto-oestrogens are as follows.Isoflavones appear to be widely distributed in the plant kingdom and over 700 different
isoflavones are described. However, the isoflavones which display oestrogenic activity belong
to a small sub-group and are restricted almost exclusively to the Leguminosae family. The
known oestrogenic isoflavones are daidzein, formononetin, genistein and biochanin A. In 
common human foodstuffs such as soya, chickpeas, lentils and beans, the total levels of the
oestrogenic isoflavones range between about 40-and 300 mg per 100 g dry weight.In the raw plant material, isoflavones occur principally as glycosides. Following ingestion by
man and animals, the glycoside moiety is hydrolysed free by a combination of gastric acid
hydrolysis and fermentation by intestinal bacteria. Some of the isoflavones in the aglucone
form are absorbed directly and circulate in the blood, while the remainder are metabolised by
intestinal fermentation to a variety of compounds which are also absorbed.
