<ABSTRACT>
A system for deploying life rafts from ships, wherein the life rafts (2, 3) are of the inflatable type and where there are stocking-like bodies (7) for transfer of personnel from the ship to at least one of the life rafts. The life rafts are arranged in groups which are loosely connected with a common bottom frame (1), and where each group comprises a reception raft (2) and several evacuation rafts (3) detachably connected with the reception raft (2). The said bottom frame (1) is suspended from at least one winch wire (4) arranged from a support frame (5) which can be moved from a parked position inside the ship's side to an operative position outside the ship's side. When the support frame (5) is in an operative position, the bottom frame (1) can be lowered into the water by means of the winch (8). The winch wires (4) pass through sliding guides (6a) in the bottom of the reception raft and sliding guides (6b) in a known per se rescue stocking (7) which is stretched between the support frame (5) and the reception raft (2). The reception raft is automatically inflated when the bottom frame (1) is lowered below the surface of the water, while at the same time the evacuation rafts (3) remain afloat uninflated beside the reception raft (2) and detachably connected with it. The evacuation rafts' inflation mechanism can be actuated manually from the reception raft as required, thus maintaining a continuous, safe escape route from the ship's deck to the evacuation rafts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a system comprising apparatus and
a method for deploying life rafts from ships, wherein the life
rafts are of the inflatable type and wherein there are
stocking-like bodies for transferring personnel from the ship
to at least one of the life rafts.Evacuation from ships in distress has traditionally been
performed by the deployment of davit launched lifeboats, where
all the evacuees board the lifeboat before it is lowered into
the water. In fair weather and calm waters this is a
relatively safe operation, which can also be used in
situations other than emergencies, such as when disembarking
passengers from tourist ships in areas where the ship cannot
go alongside the quay. However, in rough seas, which is probably the case when a ship
is in distress, the deployment of davit launched lifeboats is
an extremely risky operation. There are several reasons for
this: The lifeboats can easily be smashed to pieces against the
ship's side when they hit the waves. If the davit wires are not
released synchronously and at the right moment the lifeboats
can overturn or fall into the water from too great a height.
Stress or panic on the part of the crew or passengers can lead
to critical misjudgements. When the boat is afloat in the
water and is detached from the davit wires it is facing alongside
and not away from the ship's side, thus making it difficult
to manoeuvre the boat to a safe distance in time. In the
panic, the boats can also be put into the water too soon, thus
leaving many passengers on board or they have to spend precious
time in finding another "vacant" lifeboat station. Or the
passengers may be unevenly distributed with the result that
some lifeboats become overcrowded and not very seaworthy.
Finally it should be mentioned that all the passengers are on
board the lifeboat during the actual lowering, so that even a
minor technical mishap with only one of several lifeboats can
have fatal consequences despite ample surplus capacity in the
lifeboat fleet.Many proposals have been presented for solving these problems.
For example so-called free fall lifeboats have been introduced,
which are covered lifeboats with an extra strong construction
and special design, which fall or slide in free fall out into
the water and at the moment of impact receive a hydrodynamic
force pushing them clear of the ship independent of the lifeboat's
motor power. These lifeboats have a reduced risk of
colliding with the ship's side, but otherwise still retain many
of the same disadvantages as davit launched

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for deploying life rafts from ships, wherein
the life rafts are of the inflatable type and wherein there

are stocking-like bodies for transferring people from the ship
to at least one of the life rafts, characterized in that:-


groups of packed life rafts are loosely connected with a
common bottom frame (1),
that each group comprises a reception raft (2) and
several evacuation rafts (3) detachably connected with

the reception raft,
that the said bottom frame is suspended from at least one
winch wire (4) arranged from a support frame (5) movable

between a parked position inside the ship's side and an
operative position outside the ship's side,
that the bottom frame (1) can be winched in a controlled
manner down into the water from the support frame when

the latter is in the said operative position,
that the winch wires pass through sliding guides (6a) in
the bottom of the reception raft and also through sliding

guides (6b) in at least one known per se rescue stocking
(7) which is permanently connected at its upper end with

the support frame (5) and at its lower end rests on the
reception raft (2),
that the rafts are releasable from the bottom frame to
float on the water when the bottom frame is lowered bel
ow
the waterline,

and that in operation:-

the reception raft (2) is automatically inflatable after
being released from the bottom frame,
and that the attached evacuation rafts (3) are manually
releasable from the reception raft as required,

thus maintaining a continuous, safe escape route from the
ship's deck to the raft. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the
said bottom frame (1) can be lowered to a depth in the water

approximately free of wave influence and that the bottom frame
has a weight and design which make it suitable for stabilizing

the support wires (4).
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the winch (8) which supports the

bottom frame (1) is of a type which absorbs a minimum tension
in the support wires if the support frame and bottom frame are

moved relative to each other during operation.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that when it is not in use the entire

system is inserted behind a hatch (9) in the actual ship's
side, protected against wind and weather, but in full

readiness in a position which is suitable for evacuation.
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the
hatch (9) in the ship's side is openable automatically by the

support frame (5) when the support frame is moved from a
parked to an operative position.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that the
hatch (9) is an integral part of the support frame (5) and

that the moving of the support frame and thereby the opening
or closing of the hatch is performed telescopically (16).
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the support frame (5) is

suspended from a mechanism which is of such a nature that the
force of gravity alone can move the support frame from a

parked to an operative position when a locking mechanism (11)
is released. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that the
support frame (5) is suspended from a telescopic mechanism

(16) which is tilted so that the force of gravity obtains a
component in the telescope's extruded direction which is

sufficient to overcome the friction when the locking mechanism
(11) is released.
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the
support frame with all the equipment is arranged inside a

special fireproof room (12) together with life-jackets (13),
possibly warm clothing or travelling rugs (14) and audiovisual

aids (15) which provide all the necessary evacuation
instructions.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that all its vital functions can be

remotely controlled from the bridge.
A method for deploying life rafts from ships, the method
comprising the use of apparatus according to any of claims 1

to 10, the method comprising the steps of:-

moving the said support frame from a parked position
inside the ship's side to an operative position outside

the ship's side,
winching the bottom frame (1) in a controlled manner
down into the water from the support frame,
releasing the rafts from the bottom frame to float on the
water when the bottom frame is lowered below the

waterline,
and automatically inflating the reception raft (2) after
release from the bottom frame,
manually releasing the attached evacuation rafts (3) from
the reception raft as required,

thus maintaining a continuous, safe escape route from the
