<ABSTRACT>
In a shoe (1) with a central rotary fastener (6) it is proposed to arrange said central rotary fastener (6) in such a way that it is properly protected against load acting from above. This is achieved in that the central rotary fastener (6) is arranged in the peripheral region of the outside of the ankle (5). The tensioner (7) runs from the central rotary fastener (6) guided alternately between the instep cover (3) and the upper material (2) towards the toe (8) of the shoe. In the region of the foot-toe joint (4) the tensioner spans the instep and runs upwards on the other side guided alternately between the instep cover (3) and the other side of the upper material (2).

<CLAIMS>
Footwear, especially footwear for sport or leisure, with an upper 
part at least some of which consists of flexible material and which 

reaches at least up to the ankle on both sides and in particular overlaps 
or projects well above it, with an instep covering which covers the in-step 

of the foot and is movable after the style of a tongue or forms the 
tongue or one part of a tongue, and with a central rotary closure which 

is coupled to a tension element and by which the tension length of the 
tension element my be shortened for closing the footwear and lengthened 

for opening the footwear, because the tension element is led alternately 
from a deflector element on each side part of the upper material to a 

deflector element on the instep covering, characterized in that 
the central rotary closure (6) is provided on the outside (2) of the 

upper in the region (12) round the ankle on the outside (5) and that 
the tension element (7) runs from the central rotary closure (6), being 

led alternately between the instep covering (3) and the side part (2) of 
the upper material, in the direction of the toe (8) of the footwear, then 

crosses the instep in the region (4) of the main joint of the toes and 
runs upwards on the other side, being led alternately between the instep 

covering (3) and the other side part (2) of the upper material, and is 

either fastened to the upper material in the region of the ankle 
on the inside (10); 
or led back to the central rotary closure (6) round the upper at 
the heel (11) and fastened to the upper material in the region of the 

central rotary closure (6) or coupled to the central rotary closure (6). 
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
   the central rotary closure (6) is provided in an area (12.1) between 

the heel portion (11) of the upper and the region of the instep, above 
the ankle on the outside (5). 
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
   the central rotary closure (6) is provided in an area (12.2) between 

the heel portion (11) of the upper and the region of the instep, below 
the ankle on the outside (5). 
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
   the central rotary closure (6) in provided in an area (12.3) between  

 
the ankle on the outside (5) and the heel portion (11) of the upper. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
 
   the central rotary closure (6) as well as one of the uppermost first 

deflector elements (UR1) present on the respective side regions of the 
instep covering (3) are provided in such a way that in the taut state the 

tension element (7) from the central rotary closure (6) to the said deflector 
element (UR1) makes an angle (+α/-α) to an imaginary horizontal 

line (14) of about +70° to -15°. 
Footwear as in Claim 5, characterized in that
 
   the central rotary closure (6) and the uppermost first deflector 

element (UR1) are arranged in such a way that the tension action of the 
tension element (7) is directed in the direction towards the heel or the 

heel portion (11) of the upper. 
Footwear as in Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that
 
   the deflector element (UR2) provided on the side regions of the 

instep covering (3) next to the respective uppermost first deflector 
element (UR1), and the deflector element (US1) which is provided between 

the latter on the side part (2) of the upper and associated with these 
two deflector elements (UR1, UR2) and able to be tightened with them, are 

arranged in such a way that the tension action of the tension element (7) 
is directed on the inside in the direction of a region between the heel 

portion (11) of the upper and the arch of the foot, and on the outside in 
the direction of a region between the heel portion (11) of the upper and 

the metatarsal bones. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
 
   the instep covring (3) is divided longitudinally in the portion (3.1) 

above the ankle and the point of separation (17) my be closed by a slit 
snap closure (18) provided there, especially in the form of a zip-fastener, 

slide fastener or climbing fastener with overlapping parts. 
Footwear as in Claim 8, characterized in that
 
   the portion (3.1) with the slit snap fastener (18) stands up at least 

partially above the edge (15) of the upper of the shoe.
