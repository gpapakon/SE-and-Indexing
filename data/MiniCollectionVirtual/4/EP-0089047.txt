<ABSTRACT>
A carrier ring (10) for achieving attachment to the 
thermoplastic perform (50) as the preform is formed in a split 

injection mold (39) is disclosed. The split injection mold (39) 
defines a mold cavity into which a core pin (32) is position­

able. The mold cavity, along with the positionable core pin, 
defines the principal portion of the preform cavity. The 

remainder of the preform cavity is provided by an annular 
groove (17) in the carrier ring (10). This annular groove (17) 

has a substantially horizontal outwardly extending first wall 
(18), a substantially horizontal inwardly extending second 

wall (22) downwardly displaced from the first wall (18), and a 
downwardly and inwardly extending third wall (20) emanat­

ing from the outwardmost extent of the first wall (18) and 
terminating at the inward most extent of the second wall 

(22).

 TRANSPORT NECK RING
 In the formation of thermoplastic containers it is oftentimes advantageous to form the containers using a multiple step process and apparatus. In U.S.


2,331,702; U.S. 3,172,929; U.S. 3,412,188; U.S.


3,850,562 and U.S. 4,151,247 two principal steps are used, i.e. a preform is made by injection molding and the injectiOn molded preform is blow-molded to yield the final product. Some of the processes and apparatuses described in these patents utilize additional temperature conditioning steps between the injection molding step and the blow-molding step.


 A different type of process and apparatus is described in U.S. 4,004,872. This patent teaches that containers can be formed by the utilization of a three step process, i.e. extrusion of a parison, pre-blowing of the parison to a shape similar to but smaller than the desired final shape and blowing the pre-blown parison to the final shape. Additional steps may be utilized between the pre-blow and the final-blow steps.


 Irrespective of the type of multistage process used it is necessary to transport the injection formed preform or the pre-blown parison from its formation station to the blow molding station and to all other  ancillary stations therebetween. As can be seen from the above mentioned patents it is well known to affect such transport by attaching the preform or pre-blown parison at a point adjacent its neck to a powered apparatus which moves the attached preform or pre-blown parison from station to station.


 Special concern about the attaching systems used by multi-step apparatuses has been raised by the carbonated beverage industry whose use of thermoplastic containers has soared to hundreds of millions of containers per year. This industry needs a container with a neck which has an interior wall adjacent the neck which is as smooth as possible and which has an undistorted well-defined neck thread. A smooth interior neck wall is desirable to accommodate the high speed fill lines used today while a high quality thread is needed to insure high fidelity in fitment of a closure to the threaded container neck.


 Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a neck ring, associated with a transport mechanism, for achieving attachment of a parison or pre-blow preform without affecting neck thread quality and the smoothness of the interior neck wall.


 This invention relates to a unique carrier ring for achieving attachment to a thermoplastic preform as the preform is formed in a split injection mold. The

CLAIMS:



 1. A carrier ring (10) for achieving attachment to a thermoplastic preform (50) as said preform is formed in a split injection mold (39), which split injection mold defines an injection mold cavity into which a core pin (32) is positionable to define the principal portion of a preform cavity, said carrier ring (10) being characterized by having an annular shape with its bore dimensioned for passage and seating of said core pin (32) and having at its inner lowermost extent an annular groove (17) which defines the remaining portion of said preform cavity, said annular groove having:

 (a) a substantially horizontal outwardly
 extending first wall (18) which defines

 a portion of the upper surface of said
 preform cavity;

 (b) a substantially horizontal inwardly
 extending second wall (22) downwardly

 displaced from said first wall;

 and
 (c) a downwardly and inwardly extending

 third wall (20) emanating from the
 outward most extent of said first wall

 and terminating at the inward most
 extent of said second wall, whereby, subsequent to the formation of said thermoplastic preform, said carrier ring maintains said  attachment to said preform even after said core pin is removed from said injection mold cavity and said preform is removed from said split injection mold.




   2.    The carrier ring (10) of Claim 1 further characterized by said first wall (18) having a length within the range from 0.05 to 0.254 centimeters and said second wall has a length within the range from 0.0127 to 0.0762 centimeters.



 3. The carrier ring (10) of Claim 2 further characterized by said third wall (22) defining an angle within the range from 50 to 80 degrees with respect to a plane perpendicular to the center axis of said carrier ring (10).



 4. The carrier ring (10) of Claims 1 or 3 further characterized by said carrier ring (10) being downwardly depending from power transport mechanism for moving said carrier ring (10) and the attached preform (50) from the area of said split injection mold (39) after said core pin (32) is removed from said injection mold cavity and the split injection mold (39) is opened.
