<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium comprising a 
magnetizable layer provided on a nonmagnetizable 

support. The magnetizable layer comprises a magnetic 
pigment dispersed in a cured binder. The cured binder 

is derived from binder materials comprising: 

(a) a first polymer having a Tg of about 60°C 
or more, wherein said first polymer comprises a 

plurality of isocyanate crosslinkable hydroxy groups and 
a plurality of radiation crosslinkable groups; and 
(b) a second polymer having a Tg of about 
25°C or less, wherein said second polymer comprises a 

plurality of isocyanate cross-linkable hydroxy groups 

and a plurality of radiation crosslinkable curable 
groups, wherein the weight ratio of the second polymer 

to the first polymer is in the range from 1:19 to 19:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic 
recording media. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to magnetic recording media comprising 
a cured binder obtained from polymers having 
crosslinkable hydroxy groups and crosslinkable 
(meth)acrylate groups. Magnetic recording media generally comprise a 
magnetizable layer coated on at least one side of a 
nonmagnetizable support. For particulate magnetic 
recording media, the magnetizable layer comprises a 
magnetic pigment dispersed in a polymeric binder. The 
magnetizable layer may also include other components 
such as lubricants; abrasives; thermal stabilizers; 
antioxidants; dispersants; wetting agents; antistatic 
agents; fungicides; bactericides; surfactants; coating 
aids; nonmagnetic pigments; and the like. Some forms of magnetic recording media, such 
as flexible magnetic recording tape, also have a 
backside coating applied to the other side of the 
nonmagnetizable support in order to improve the 
durability, conductivity, and tracking characteristics 
of the media. The backside coating typically comprises 
a polymeric binder, but may also include other 
components such as lubricants; abrasives; thermal 
stabilizers; antioxidants; dispersants; wetting agents; 
antistatic agents; fungicides; bactericides;  
 
surfactants; coating aids; nonmagnetic pigments; and the 
like. The magnetizable layer and the backside 
coating, if any, of a majority of conventional magnetic 
recording media are derived from materials which require 
curing in order to provide magnetic recording media with 
appropriate physical and mechanical properties. To 
prepare such magnetic recording media, the uncured 
components of the magnetizable layer or the backside 
coating, as appropriate, are combined with a suitable 
solvent and then mixed to provide a homogeneous 
dispersion. The resulting dispersion is then coated 
onto the nonmagnetizable support, after which the 
coating is dried, calendered if desired, and then cured. Curing can be achieved in a variety of ways. 
According to one approach, the polymeric binder of the 
magnetizable layer or the backside coating is derived 
from hydroxy functional polymers. Such polymers rely 
upon a chemical reaction between the hydroxy 
functionality and an isocyanate crosslinking agent to 
achieve curing. The isocyanate crosslinking agent is 
typically added to the dispersion just prior to the time 
that the dispersion is coated onto the support. Radiation curable dispersions have been used 
as an alternative to
