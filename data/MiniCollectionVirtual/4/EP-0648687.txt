<ABSTRACT>
An easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging bag 
1 whose opening end is heat-sealed, with a sealing material 

interposed therein, wherein the sealing material comprises 
(a) an intermediate resin strip comprising a low-sealable 

resin layer and (b) two outer resin strips, the outsides of 
the outer resin strips being strongly bonded to the inside 

of the packaging bag by heat-sealing and being weakly melt-bonded 
to both sides of the intermediate resin strip, the 

innermost ends of the melt-bonded interfaces between the 
intermediate resin strip and the outer resin strips are 

located inner in the packaging bag than the innermost ends 
of the heat-sealed parts between the packaging bag and the 

outer resin strips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to easily-openable, 
hermetically-sealed, packaging bags which are suitable for 
packaging boil-in-pouch foods or retort-in-pouch foods. Hermetically-sealed bags are usually produced by 
filling a packaging bag with a content through an open end, 
closing the open end to make contact between two opposite 
sides of the inside of the packaging bag and then heat-sealing 
the opposite sides to each other. The thus 
produced hermetically-sealed packaging bags are 
unsatisfactory because when the sealability is increased by 
increasing the heat-sealing strength, the opening step is 
made difficult, requiring cutlery for opening to use the 
contents. Particularly, packaging bags to be subjected to 
heat processing, such as retort sterilization, need such a 
high sealability as to stand the internal pressure 
increased by the heat processing, and are difficult to 
endow with good opening characteristics.  
 A means proposed to solve this problem is to 
heat-seal with relatively low heat-sealing temperature the 
inside of the open end of packaging bags, with a sealing 
material, which is composed of two strips being bonded to 
each other with an adhesive which can make a good seal with the 
inside of the packaging bags, interposed in the open end, 
to give a hermetically-sealed packaging bag, which has a 
high sealability and also has good opening characteristics ensured 
by the peeling between the surfaces bonded by the adhesive. 
This means however is poor in the productivity because of 
the complicated procedures for applying adhesives. The object of the present invention is to provide 
an easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging bag which 
exhibits both good opening characteristics and high sealability 
without the aid of adhesives. The inventors made researches to solve the above-described 
problems and found that easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, 
packaging bags being excellent both in sealability 
and in opening characteristics are obtainable by heat-sealing the 
inside of the opening end of packaging bags, with a layered 
sealing material of a specific layer structure interposed 
therein. Based on the finding, the inventors have  
 
completed the present invention. That is, the present invention provides an easyly 
openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging bag, comprising 
a packaging bag and a sealing material of a strip form, 
the packaging bag having an opening end which is hermetically 
sealed, with the sealing material interposed therein, and 
with the inside

<CLAIMS>
An easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging bag, 
comprising 


a packaging bag (1) and a sealing material of a strip form, 
the packaging bag having an opening end which is hermetically 

sealed, with the sealing material interposed therein, and 
with the inside of the opening end strongly bonded to both 

sides of the sealing material by heat-sealing to form two 
strongly heat-sealed parts (9) between the inside of the 

packaging bag (1) and both sides of the sealing material, 
characterized in that the sealing material comprises (a) an 

intermediate resin strip (2) comprising a resin layer (3) 
having low sealability which is hard to b
ond to the inside of 
the packaging bag (1) by heat-sealing and two resin layers 

(4) and (5) which are strongly melt-bonded to both sides of 
the low-sealable resin layer (3) to form two strongly melt-bonded 

interfaces (9) and (b) two outer resin strips (6) and 
(7) which are weakly melt-bonded, respectively, to both sides 

of the intermediate resin strip (2) to form two weakly melt-bonded 
interfaces (8) between the intermediate resin strip 

(2), and the outer resin strips (6) and (7), 
the innermost ends of the weakly melt-bonded interfaces (8) 
being at a more inner location in the packaging bag (1) than 

the strongly heat-sealed parts (9). 
The easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging 
bag of claim 1, wherein the outermost end of the resin layer 

(3) having low sealability of the intermediate resin strip (2) is 
located outer toward outside of the packaging bag (1) than the 

outermost ends of the outer resin strips (6) and (7). 
The easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging 
bag of claim 2, wherein the intermediate resin strip (2) 

consists of the resin layer (3) having low sealability and two 
resin layers (4) and (5) which are strongly melt-bonded to both 

sides of the low-sealable resin layer (3), respectively, and 
the outermost end of the melt-bonded resin layer (3) is located 

outer toward outside of the packaging bag (1) than the 
outermost ends of the resin layers (4) and (5) and the outermost 

ends of the outer resin strips (6) and (7). 
The easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging 
bag of claim 3, wherein the packaging bag (1) is made of a 

multilayer sheet comprising at least an inner layer of a 
synthetic resin and an outer layer of a synthetic resin, the  

 
synthetic resin of the outer layer being higher in melting 

point than the synthetic resin of the inner layer. 
The easily-openable, hermetically-sealed, packaging 
bag of claim 4, wherein the outer layer of the packaging bag 

(1) is an oriented nylon layer, the inner layer of the 
packaging bag (1) is a layer of a polypropylene, each of the 

outer resin strips (6) and (7) is a strip of a polypropylene, 
each of the resin layers (4) and (5) is a layer of a linear low 

density polyethylene or a mixture of a polybutene-1 and an 
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and the resin layer (3)

polyethylene.
