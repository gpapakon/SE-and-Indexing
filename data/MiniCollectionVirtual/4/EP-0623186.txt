<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder lock-key-combination includes a lock cylinder, a cylinder housing (2) and a cylinder plug (3) provided with a key slot (3a) and a row of tumblers (5). The tumblers (5) and associated key (4) present mutually adapted engaging and receiving members which function to forcibly guide movement of the tumblers in two opposite axial directions as the key is inserted into the lock. For instance, the pin tumblers (5) include a circular flange (5a) and a side surface of the key (4) includes a groove (4b) which extends along the length of the key and whose width varies so as to accommodate the flanges of the rotatable or twistable tumblers. Alternatively, the tumblers are provided with a groove or a waisted portion and the key is provided on a side surface thereof with a rail which engages in the groove or waisted portion. In addition, the tumblers (5) may be provided with waisted portions (5b) to enable the tumblers to function as latching pins in coaction with a side-bar, or to form bottom tumblers for coaction with corresponding spring-activated top tumblers, or to function as locking pins in direct engagement with bores provided in the lock housing. The invention also relates to a key for forcibly guiding the pin tumblers, and also to a method of manufacturing such a key from a key blank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylinder lock-key-combination,
and more specifically to a cylinder lock-key-combination
of the kind defined in the preamble of
Claim 1.SE-B-422 481 (GKN-Stenman) and US-A-4,393,673
(Widén) describe a combination of this kind in which
the key, in addition to a web part, has a side part
which includes a coded surface having code parts or
shoulders for engagement with an edge part of one end
of the respective pin tumblers and with transition
parts which extend in the direction of the long axis
of the key between mutually adjacent code shoulders,
The code shoulders and transition parts of the side
part of the key include parts of surfaces which are
described by a point or by a line or curve provided
with an end point which rotate with said point for
said end point at a given distance from point on an
axis which extends generally parallel with the axes of
the pin tumblers, said axes moving continuously or
discontinuously in a plane that extends through the
pin axes or in a plane which is generality parallel
therewith.The pin tumblers may coact with spring - activated top
tumblers or may themselves be activated and
provided with waisted parts for coaction with outwardly
projecting shoulders on a side-bar. The side-bar is spring-biassed outwardly from the
cylinder, into engagement with a recess in the look
housing, this recess being configured to urge the
side-bar into the cylinder plug as its rotates, subsequent
to having inserted the correct key into an
operative position in the plug. The side-bar includes
a number of lugs having rounded engagement surfaces
which coact with waisted parts of the side-bar. In
manufacture, the coded surfaces and the intermediate
transition surfaces must be produced very accurately,
and consequently the cylinder lock taught by this
prior publication is comparatively expensive to produce.US-A-4,393,673, 4,815,307 and 5,067,335, and SE,B, 455,801 (all Widén) describe
other types of locks which are provided with a side-bar
and the pin tumblers of which are guided forcibly in
different directions of rotation and have a form which
makes the lock expensive to produce.US-A-3,264,852 (Gysin) teaches a cylinder lock with
which there is used a key which is provided on the
side surfaces thereof with grooves which, when the key
is inserted to an operative position in the plug,
coact with tumblers that have outwardly projecting
pins for engagement in respective grooves. The tumblers
of this lock do not coact with a side-bar.
Moreover, the pins on the

<CLAIMS>
A cylinder lock-key-combination in which the
cylinder lock (1) comprises


a) a cylinder which is housed in a cylinder housing
(2);
b) a plug (3) which is accommodated in the cylinder
housing (2) and has a key slot (3a) and a row of pin

tumblers (5) whose axes lie in a plane which is
parallel with or essentially parallel with the plane

of the key slot, and spaced from said plane, and in
which the key-actuable tumblers are able to move in

the pin tumbler plane and rotate about their axes when
activated by the key (4); and which key includes
c) a code which is formed in the side region of the
key and which functions to coact with the pin tumblers

(5) in said tumbler row so that subsequent to inserting
the key to its operative position in the slot

(3a), each pin tumbler will occupy a position which
allows the plug (3) to be turned,
characterized in
d) that the pin tumblers (5) and the key (4) each
have a mutually adapted engaging and receiving member

(5a, 4f) which function to guide the tumblers forcibly
in two mutually opposite axial directions to respective

code positions as the key is inserted, while
permitting the tumblers to rotate freely about their

respective axes,
e) that each said engaging and receiving member (5a,
4f) comprises top and bottom surfaces providing double

engagement with its mutual coacting member and permitting
said free rotation of the pin tumblers around

their axes,
f) that each said tumbler's engaging member is a
circular flange (5a), and
g) that said key (4) has a receiving member being a
groove (4f) including straight parts (4e) which extend

in parallel with the key insertion direction and which 
normally define the tumbler code positions, and further

including intermediate, straight angled transition
parts (4g) of greater width.
A combination according to Claim 1,

 that a code position
is also defined by one or more of the transition parts

(4g).
A combination according to Claims 1 or 2, in

top tumblers, optionally through the intermediary

bottom sides.
A combination according to any one of Claims 1-3,

(Figure 16).
A combination according to Claim 3,

 that the
key slot (3a) is positioned asymmetrically in the

plug, so that the tumbler axes will lie essentially in
the centre plane of the plug.
A combination according to any one of the preceding
