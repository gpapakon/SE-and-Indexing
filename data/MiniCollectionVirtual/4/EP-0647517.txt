<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to molding irregular hollow 
thermoplastic objects (10) having irregular shapes and 

particularly those having non-straight line centerlines (18,16). 
A mold is provided which comprises a cavity having a shape 

of the object and being dividing into two half molds (50,52) by 
non-planar interfacing parting surfaces containing such 

non-straight line centerline. The molds (50,52) are adapted to be 
separated while maintaining the centerlines (67,69) co-planar. 

Means are provided for inserting a parison (58) between the 
open half-molds (50,52) with the parison co-planar to the center 

lines (67,69) and means are provided for closing the molds while 
maintaining this co-planar relationship. Accordingly, the 

parison (58) may be inserted into the cavity without the need 
for manipulating the parison relative to the mold.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the molding of certain 
hollow thermoplastic objects having irregular shapes and 
in particular, such objects as bottles having curvilinear 
or angled center lines as contrasted with having straight-line 
center lines. A particular application of this invention is 
directed toward molding baby bottles of the kind described 
in U.S. Patent 4,676,387. Such a bottle comprises two 
generally cylindrical sections each having an axis, the 
axes intersecting at an angle to each other resulting in 
a "bent" shape. The bent shape of the bottle is said to 
facilitate the feeding of the infant irrespective of the 
infant being in a reclined nursing position or in a 
sitting position. The preferable method of molding such objects as baby 
bottles is the blow molding technique wherein a mold is 
provided having a cavity therein of the shape of the 
bottle. The mold is split into two parts through the 
cavity section which parts are separated to introduce 
there between a hallow molten tube of the thermoplastic 
material to be employed (such thermoplastic molten tube 
referred to in the art as a parison). The molded parts 
are brought together with the molten tube residing in the 
cavity. A blow pin is inserted into one end of the hollow 
tube and a gas is then introduced into the tube via the 
blow pin to expand the tube aqainst the walls of the 
cavity, whereby the tube takes the shape of the cavity. 
The mold is then opened and the object is subjected to 
further molding and finishing processes. The above described method is generally employed in 
the production of bottles having straight-line center 
lines e.g., bottles which are essentially right cylinders,  
 
using conventionally designed molds. Unfortunately, as 
will be described herein, when it is desired to produce 
bottles having irregular shapes, conventional mold designs 
and molding techniques must be modified to accommodate the 
unusual shape of the object to be molded. Accordingly, 
there is a need for a design which is capable of 
facilitating the molding of irregular objects. In accordance with the teachings of this invention, 
a method and apparatus is provided for molding irregular 
hollow objects such as are exemplified herein by baby 
bottles. The certain irregular hollow objects encompassed 
within the scope of this invention are ones which have a 
centerline which centerline defines a unique plane. Thus, 
for example, a curvilinear centerline defines a single 
plane i.e., there is only one unique plane that can 
conta

<CLAIMS>
A method for molding an object having a centerline 
which defines a unique plane comprising the steps of: 

   providing a mold having a cavity therein in the 
shape of the object; said cavity having a cavity 

centerline also defining a unique plane and said mold 
comprising two half molds, divided by non-planar 

interfacing parting surfaces containing said cavity 
centerline; 

   positioning said half mold in an open position 
with the parting surfaces facing each other and 

spaced apart and with the cavity centerlines of each 
half mold aligned to be substantially co-planar; 

   position a parison having a longitudinal axis 
between the half molds with the axis of the parison 

also substantially co-planar to the cavity 
centerlines; and 

   closing said half-molds so that the parting 
surfaces interface while maintaining the 

substantially co-planar relationship of the cavity 
centerlines and the parison axis. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the object has a 
curvilinear centerline, and the parting surfaces are 

curvilinear. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the object comprises 
two right cylinders meeting at an angle and the centerline 

comprises the intersecting axes of said right cylinders. 
The method of claim 3 wherein the parting surfaces 
each comprise two intersecting planes each plane 

containing one of said intersecting axes. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said parison comprises 
a polycarbonate thermoplastic material and said object is 

a baby bottle. 
A mold for producing an object having a centerline 
which defines a unique plane, said mold comprising: 

   walls, defining a cavity in the shape of the 
object, said cavity having a cavity centerline also 

defining a unique plane; 
   said mold comprising two half molds, divided by 

non-planar interfacing parting surfaces each 
containing said cavity centerline; 

   means for spacing said half molds apart into an 
open position whereby said parting surfaces face each 

other and said cavity centerlines are co-planar; 
   means for providing a parison having an axis 

between said half molds with the axis with the axis 
of the parison co-planar with the cavity centerlines; 

and 
   means for closing said half-molds about said 

parison while maintaining the co-planar relationship 
of said cavity centerlines and said axis of the 

parison.

curvilinear centerline wherein the parting surfaces are 

curvilinear. 
The mold of claim 6 for molding an object comprising 
two right cylinders m
eeting at an angle and having a 
centerline comprising the intersecting axes of said right 

cylinders wherein the non-planar parting surfaces each 
comprise two intersecting planes, each containing one of 

said intersecting axes. 
The mold of claim 1 for molding a baby bottle.
