<ABSTRACT>
A subterranean zone located in a well is treated 
by injecting a treating composition into the well to place 

the treating composition in the subterranean zone. the 
treating composition comprising a gelled carrier; a 

particulate material; an epoxy resin system including at 
least one epoxy resin; and a finely-divided hardening agent 

which, when dissolved, is operable for hardening the epoxy 
resin, the finely-divided hardening agent being dispersed in 

the epoxy resin system. The finely-divided hardening agent 
is maintained under conditions such that, prior to injecting 

the composition into the well, the finely-divided hardening 
agent does not substantially dissolve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
treating a subterranean formation using a consolidatable
epoxy resin-coated particulate material.Consolidatable epoxy resin-coated particulate
materials have been used heretofore in various well
treatment operations. Consolidatable epoxy resin-coated
sands have been used, for example, for gravel packing, for
the development of controlled permeability synthetic
formations within subterranean zones, and as proppant
materials in formation fracturing operations. Due to their
desirable permeability and compressive strength
characteristics, consolidatable epoxy resin-coated
particulate materials are especially well-suited for
treating semiconsolidated and unconsolidated formations
which contain loose or unstable sands.As used herein, the term "consolidatable epoxy
resin-coated particulate material" refers to a particulate
material which is coated with an uncured or only partially
cured epoxy resin composition. Typically, the
consolidatable epoxy resin-coated particulate material will
be injected into a subterranean zone using procedures
whereby the epoxy resin does not substantially harden until
after the particulate material has been delivered to a
desired location within the formation. The consolidatable
epoxy resin-coated particulate 
material will typically harden within the formation to form a
hard, consolidated, permeable mass.Well treatment methods utilizing consolidatable epoxy
resin-coated particulate materials are disclosed, for example,
in U.S. Patent No. 5,128,390. The entire disclosure of U.S.
Patent No. 5,128,390 is incorporated herein by reference.U.S. Patent No. 5,128,390 discloses a method for
continuously forming and transporting consolidatable resincoated
particulate materials. In the method of U.S. Patent
No. 5,128,390, a stream of gelled aqueous carrier liquid is
continuously mixed with a particulate material (e.g., sand),
a hardenable epoxy resin composition, and a surface active
agent. The resulting continuous composition is delivered to
and/or injected into a desired subterranean zone. As the
continuous mixture flows down the well tubing toward the
subterranean zone, the composition ingredients are thoroughly
mixed such that the gel-suspended particulate material is
coated with the hardenable epoxy resin composition. After
being placed in the subterranean zone, the epoxy resin
composition is allowed to harden whereby the resin-coated
particulate material forms a hard, permeable, consolidated
mass.The hardenable epoxy resin composition used

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating a subterranean zone in a
well, which method comprises the steps of:


(a) injecting a treating composition into the well to
place the composition in the said, subterranean

zone; wherein the treating composition comprises a
gelled carrier, a particulate material, an epoxy

resin system including at least one epoxy resin,
and a finely-divided hardening agent which, when

dissolved, is operable for hardening said epoxy
resin, at least a portion of said finely-divided

hardening agent being dispersed in said epoxy
resin system; and
(b) maintaining the finely-divided hardening agent
under conditions such that, prior to injecting the

composition into the well in accordance with step
(a), the finely-divided hardening agent is not

substantially dissolved.
A method according to claim 1, further comprising
the step, prior to step (a), of premixing the finely-divided

hardening agent with the epoxy resin system.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the finely-divided
hardening agent is premixed with the epoxy resin

system at least one day prior to step (a).
A method according to claim 2 or 3, wherein said
finely-divided hardening agent is premixed with said epoxy

resin system by mixing with said epoxy resin system a slurry
comprising the finely-divided hardening agent and a carrier

liquid. 
A method according to claim 4, wherein the carrier
liquid is methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl

acetate, butyl lactate, toluene, xylene, isoamyl alcohol,
isohexyl alcohol, or any mixture of two or more thereof.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the epoxy resin system further includes at least one

solvent.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the treating composition is prepared by:


(i) adding the particulate material to a substantially
continuous stream comprising water and a gelling

agent; and
(ii) adding the epoxy resin system and the finely-divided
hardening agent to said continuous

stream.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7,
wherein the finely-divided hardening agent is

4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 8,
wherein said subterranean zone is a subterranean formation

and said treating composition is injected into the well
under sufficient pressure to fracture the subterranean

formation.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 9,
wherein the treating composition is injected into the well

such that the particulate material is coated with the epoxy
resin system and the finely-divided hardening agent, and the

coated particulate material is deposited in said
subterranean zone around a screening device.
