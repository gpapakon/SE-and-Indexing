<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical detection cell (320), which is usable either for potentiometric or electrolytic conductivity detection, has a capillary (305), which controls electrolyte flow. A gas stream containing detectable substances is input through a non-wettable plastic capillary (306). A reaction zone (310) through which both gas and liquid flow is internally wettable. Reference electrode (309) and either electrode (311) or (312) may be used for potentiometric detection. Sensor electrodes (311) and (312), both in the reaction zone, are used for conductivity detection. The electrolyte is fed through the capillary (305) gravimetrically from a reservoir, and the gas stream is supplied by a pyrolysis furnace. The mechanim of ionization in the gas phase ionization detector (GPELCD) is described.

 ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTOR CELL, METHOD AND PYROLYSIS FURNACE5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention:The present invention relates generally to an improved electrochemical detector cell, an electrochemical detection method, and a pyrolysis furnace for use in 10 electrochemical detection. More paÏ€icularly, the invention relates to such a cell and method which is especially adapted for gravimetric flow. The invention further relates to such a cell and method that is usable for potentiometric, coulometric or conductimetric electrochemical detection.2. Description of the Prior An:15 Before 1950, it was common to determine the elemental composition of organic samples by combusting them and measuring the masses of simple compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water, produced. This method was called microcombustion analysis.During the 1950s, gas chromatography (GC) was discovered, so there was a20 lot of research in the late 1950s and early 1960s on GC instrumentation, including sensitive detectors. Thermal conductivity detectors were soon followed by more sensitive and selective detectors, such as hydrogen flame ionization. electron capture, argon ionization, mass spectrometric and several electrochemical detectors. The first electrochemical detectors for use in chromatography were described in25 U.S. Patent 3,032.493. issued May 1. 1962 to Coulson and Cavanagh. The use of the Coulson and Cavanagh detector with GC is described in Coulson et al.. "Microcoulometric Gas Chromatography of Pesticides", Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 8, 399-402 (Sept.-Oct. 1960) and Coulson, "Electroanalytical Instrumentation", ISA Fall Instrument -Automation Conference, Preprint No.30 181-LA-61 (Sept. 1 1- 15. 1961 ).This detection system contained essentially all of the important features of the \ electrolytic conductivity detectors that were subsequently developed, including: 

 1) An effluent gas stream from a gas chromatograph.2) A pyrolizer to convert organic compounds to simple substances, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, ammonia and water.3) A supply of liquid supporting electrolyte. 4) A contact zone to transfer electrolytes from the gas phase to the liquid phase.5) Electrodes in contact with the liquid phase.6) Means for measuring the electrolyte concentration in the liquid phase. In microcoulometry, the means for measuring is based on potentiometry and titrant generation. In electrolytic conductivity, this means is simply measurement of the ohmic resistance between two electrodes.U.S. Patent
