<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved method for 
the amplification of nucleic acid.

 
The invention is characterized in that ribonucleotides are 

introduced during amplification that weaken normal 
basepairing. Preferably the ribonucleotides are inosine-triphosphate 

nucleotides which partly substitute guanine-triphosphate 
nucleotides normally present in the 

amplification reaction mixture. The incorporation of 
nucleotides, during amplification, that weaken normal base 

pairing prevents the formation of secondary structures in 

the amplificate. The efficiency of the amplification is 
thereby increased. The introduction, during amplification, 

of nucleotides that weaken normal base pairing also 
results in an improved sensitivity during detection of the 

amplified nucleic acid, when the detection method 
comprises the hybridization of the amplified nucleic acid 

to a complementary sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
amplification of nucleic acid by NASBA.
The amplification of specific nucleic acid segments is
particularly useful for the generation of detectable
amounts of certain kinds of nucleic acid. For example when
the presence of nucleic acid characteristic for a specific
disease state is to be indicated, this nucleic acid is
generally present in biological samples in small amounts.
To be able to detect these small amounts of nucleic acid
either very sensitive detection methods would have to be
used or very large amounts of sample material would have
to be concentrated. With the present amplification
techniques the small amounts of a specific segment of
nucleic acid present in a biological sample can be
amplified. This amplified nucleic acid can readily be
detected by, for example, hybridizing it to a labelled
complementary oligonucleotide. Of course the amplification
of nucleic acid is also useful for the generation of
larger amounts of nucleic acid used in recombinant DNA
techniques and for cloning and sequencing purposes.Known techniques for the amplification of specific nucleic
acid segments are, for example, the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), as described in US patent nr. 4, 683,195
and US patent nr. 4,683,202, and Nucleic Acid Sequence
Based Amplification (NASBA), as described in European
Patent application EP 0,329,822 or J. Virol. Meth. 35, 273, 1991, Kievits et al.
With PCR large amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are
generated by treating a target DNA sequence with
oligonucleotide primers such that a primer extension
product is synthesized which is separated from the
template using heat denaturation and in turn serves as a
template, resulting in the amplification of the target DNA
sequence. When RNA is to be amplified with PCR the RNA
strand is first transcribed into a DNA strand with the aid
of reverse transcriptase. Intermediates in the Polymerase
Chain Reaction consist of DNA only. With the aid of NASBA large amounts of single stranded RNA
are generated from either single stranded RNA or DNA or
double stranded DNA. When RNA is to be amplified with
NASBA the ssRNA serves as a template for the synthesis of
a first DNA strand by elongation of a first primer
containing s RNA polymerase recognition site. This DNA
strand in turn serves as the template for the synthesis of
a second, complementary, DNA strand by elongation of a
second primer, resulting in a double stranded active RNA-polymerase
promoter site, and the second DNA strand serves
as a
