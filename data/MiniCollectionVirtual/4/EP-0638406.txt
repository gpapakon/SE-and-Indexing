<ABSTRACT>
An injection molding nozzle (12) upon which a 
thermocouple element (88) can be removably mounted and be self-retained 

in place. The nozzle (12) has a front portion (60) and a 
larger diameter rear collar portion (56) with a thermocouple 

element duct (78) therethrough. A thermocouple element bore 
(86) extends rearwardly from the front end (46) of the nozzle and a 

thermocouple element groove (84) extends outwardly across the 
rear end (58) from the thermocouple element duct (78). A front 

portion (90) of a suitably bendable and retentive thermocouple 
element (88) is inserted into the bore (86) in the front end (46) 

and bent 
to extend rearwardly to the duct (78) through the rear collar 

portion (56). A rear portion (92) of the thermocouple element (88) is 
bent into place in the groove (84) in the rear end (58). The 

thermocouple element (88) securely retains itself in this 
position while the nozzle (12) is being installed in the mold.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to injection 
molding and more particularly to a heated nozzle upon which 
a thermocouple element can be removably mounted in a 
predetermined position and be securely self-retained in 
place. It is well known to use a thermocouple element to 
continuously measure the temperature in a heated injection 
molding nozzle. In order to monitor the operating 
temperature near the gate, it is important that the 
thermocouple in the front portion of the thermocouple 
element be positioned near the front end of the nozzle. It 
is also very critical that the thermocouple in each nozzle 
be very accurately positioned. Thus the thermocouple 
element must be mounted so that it is securely retained in  
 
place, particularly during installation of the nozzle in 
the mold. An example of the thermocouple being positioned 
near the front end of the nozzle is shown in the 
applicants' U.S. Patent number 4,768,283 which issued 
September 6, 1988 where the thermocouple element extends 
into the insulative air space through a thermocouple duct 
through the rear collar portion of the nozzle. While the 
thermocouple element is bent into a groove in the rear end 
of the nozzle, there is no provision for retaining the front end of the 
thermocouple in place during installation. 
The preamble of claim 1 is based on US-A-4768283. More recently, the applicants' Canadian Patent 
Application serial number 2,078,890 filed September 22, 
1992 entitled "Injection Molding Nozzle with Thermocouple 
Receiving Torpedo" shows the thermocouple retained in 
position by a wire wrapped around the nozzle to hold the 
thermocouple element in place against it. In the 
applicants' Canadian Patent Application serial number 
2,091,409 filed March 10, 1993 entitled "Injection Molding 
Torpedo with Thermocouple Bore" the thermocouple is held in 
place by the thermocouple element extending radially 
outward into contact against a tapered portion of the well 
in the mold. However, this does not ensure that the 
thermocouple is retained in place during installation of 
the nozzle in the mold.  
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to at least partially overcome the disadvantages 
of the prior art by providing a heated nozzle upon which a 
thermocouple element can be removably mounted in a 
predetermined position and be securely self-retained in 
place. To this end, the invention provides an injection molding nozzle as defined 
in claim 1.  
 Further objects and advantages of the invention 
well appear
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A heated injection molding nozzle (12) having a 
rear end (58), a front end (46), a rear collar portion (56) adjacent the 

rear end, a front portion (60) extending forwardly from the rear 
collar portion, and a melt channel (38) extending therethrough 

to convey melt from an inlet at the rear end towards a gate 
extending through a cooled mold to a cavity (42), the rear 

collar portion having a generally cylindrical outer surface 
and the front portion having a generally cylindrical outer 

surface which is smaller in diameter than the outer surface 
of the rear collar portion, the nozzle to be seated in a 

well (66) in the cooled mold with an insulative air space 
extending between the outer surface of the front portion of 

the nozzle and a surrounding generally cylindrical inner 
surface of the well, the rear collar portion of the nozzle 

having a thermocouple element duct (78) extending therethrough 
in alignment with the insulative air space between the 

outer surface of the front portion of the nozzle and the 
surrounding inner surface of the well, 

the rear end of the nozzle has a thermocouple element groove 
(84) extending from the thermocouple element duct to the outer 

surface of the rear collar portion, characterised in that
 
   the front portion of the nozzle has a 

thermocouple element bore (86) extending a predetermined 
distance rearwardly from the front end (46),  

 
whereby a suitably bendable and 

retentive thermocouple element (88) removably mounted with a 
front portion of the thermocouple element received in the 

thermocouple element bore and bent to extend rearwardly 
through the insulative air space between the outer surface 

of the front portion of the nozzle and the surrounding 
inner surface of the well and through the thermocouple 

element duct through the rear collar portion with a rear 
portion of the thermocouple element bent to extend through 

the thermocouple element groove in the rear end of the 
nozzle is securely self-retained in place. 
An injection molding nozzle as claimed in claim 
1 wherein the nozzle has a cylindrical locating flange (68) 

extending forwardly from the rear collar portion to seat 
against a circular shoulder (70) the well in the mold, with 

a hollow thermocouple tube extending from the thermocouple 
duct in contact with the locating flange to removably 

receive the thermocouple therethrough.
