<DESCRIPTION>
Melanins are a class of structurally related
compounds that serve as the principal pigment (color)
of vertebrate skin, hair, fur and feathers. Melanin
pigmentation is largely responsible for normal skin and
hair color, and provides protection against ultraviolet
light damage from sunlight and other light sources.
Melanins are synthesized exclusively by specialized
cells termed "melanocytes" found in the skin and hair
follicles. Once synthesized, melanin is transferred
via the cellular dendrites (extensions) of the
melanocyte to the surrounding keratinocytes, the most
abundant cell type in the epidermis. The rate of
melanin synthesis, and the subsequent transfer of
melanin by melanocytes via their dendrites, appear to
be influenced by ultraviolet light exposure.Darker skin pigmentation is considered desirable
by many persons, socially and aesthetically. At
present, the most common means of darkening skin is
sun-tanning, using either natural sunlight or specially
designed ultraviolet light sources (tanning lamps).However, extended exposure of human skin to
ultraviolet light is well known to have adverse long
and short term health consequences, specifically skin
cancer and photoaging (long term) and the risk of
painful sunburn and keratitis (short term).
Furthermore, light-skinned individuals are highly
susceptible to sun-induced skin cancers, face a higher
risk of melanoma (skin cancer), and incur photoaging or
dermatoheliosis, a condition characterized by 
wrinkling, irregular pigmentation, and surface
roughness. However, even darker skinned individuals
exposed to prolonged sunlight incur a high risk of skin
cancer and exacerbated aging.Some individuals are unable to achieve even normal
pigmentation due to abnormal conditions such as
vitiligo, piebaldism, albinism, and other
hypopigmentation disorders, or as the result of certain
inflammatory processes. The result of such abnormal
conditions, in the extreme, is total depigmentation of
both hair and skin. In less severe instances, some
hypopigmentation disorders result in patchy white areas
within the skin and hair. All of these conditions can
cause severe cosmetic and psychological problems.Melanocytes and melanin content are also
responsible for the pigmentation of hair, fur and
feathers. For example, graying of hair is due to a
decrease in number or activity of the melanocytes
residing in the hair bulb. In nonhuman instances,
changes in melanocyte content and melanin synthesis
rate result in changes in the color of pelage, fur,
wool, and other kinds of
