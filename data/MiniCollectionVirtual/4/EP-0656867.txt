<ABSTRACT>
A document handling system, such as a mailing machine (10), includes a feeder station (24) operative to feed documents (26) from a stack in sequential fashion to a conveyor belt (36) of a transport station. The feeder and transport stations include discrete drive motor controllers (60, 61) operatively associated with a speed control (50) adapted to apply a control signal to the transport controller (52) and a control signal to the feeder controller (54). The feeder controller signal is slaved to the transport controller signal so as to enable changes in document feeder and transport speeds through a single control (64a). A separate gap control (76a) enables selective adjustment of the gap between successive documents for various size documents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to document
handling systems, and more particularly to a document handling
system including a document feeder station feeding documents in
successive one-at-a-time fashion to a transport conveyor.It is a conventional practice in various document
handling systems, such as mailing machines, to employ a document
feeder station to feed documents in sequential one-at-a-time
fashion from a generally vertical stack to a transport station
employing at least one conveyor belt which conveys the documents
in spaced relation along a predetermined path. As the documents
traverse the transport path, they generally pass one or more
operating stations which perform various functions on the
documents, such as applying alpha-numeric indicia to each
document. Mailing systems of this general type are commercially
available from Videojet Systems International, Inc., Wood Dale,
Illinois.In document handling systems of the aforedescribed
type, the document feeder and transport stations each typically
employ a separate controller having a drive motor responsive to
control signals to vary the motor speed, and thus the document
feed rate (documents per hour) and transport speed (feet per
minute). By selectively varying the feeder and transport drive
motor speeds, variable spacing may be obtained to accommodate
different size documents. Present mailing machines that have
variable spacing typically use independent electronic speed
controls for the feeder and transport drive motors. The speed 
of the feeder is set independently of the speed of the transport. If the speed of the
transport is changed, the gap between documents or other pieces of media either
becomes larger or smaller. This may cause a crash or jam to occur between successive
documents or media pieces, or results in a loss of production because of excessive gaps.
The feeder and transport drives of present mailing machines must be set by adjusting
both controls and then fine tuning. The preamble of claim 1 is based on the aforegoing prior art.There is disclosed in US 3,907,275 a speed control from a machine designated to
throw cut paper sheets from a conveyor on to a stack, this being achieved by a driven
roller at the end of the conveyor whose rotation propels the cut sheets on to the stack.
In this prior art the speed control involves the use of an electronic control of one or two
electric motors whereby above a certain threshold speed of the conveyor the speed of
the roller which throws the sheets from the conveyor is slaved
