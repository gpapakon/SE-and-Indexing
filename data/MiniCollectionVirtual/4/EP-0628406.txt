<ABSTRACT>
A honeycomb sandwich panel is modified by the controlled 
incursion of a foaming 

adhesive (2) into the upper region of the honeycomb. This provides 
a panel having increased 

durability when the upper surface (17) is subjected to localized 
compressive loads.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a low weight panel with increased durability when the upper 
surface is subjected to localized compressive loads. Current sandwich structures used for aircraft flooring use only a single density honeycomb 
core in this construction. Heavy traffic on such flooring frequently causes failure or 
damage to the upper surface requiring that the flooring be replaced at great cost and 
inconvenience. In order to increase the durability of such flooring panels and to increase their resistance to 
concentrated transverse compressive loads, either more skin material or higher honeycomb 
core densities or both must be used. Both of these remedies are basically unacceptable 
since they each substantially increase the panel weight. This is an unacceptable solution 
for aircraft structures where a minimum weight is always desired. Many attempts to solve the problems stated above have been made. U.S. Patent No. 
4,937,125 describes one approach where a multilayer sandwich structure having a core 
interposed between and external and internal skin. The upper skin is a composite 
layer-polyester layer-honeycomb layer-metal sheet-glass fiber reinforced epoxy 
layer-composite layer. The core is a honeycomb. The internal skin is a metal sheet or a 
skin of the same composition as the external skin. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,336,292; 5,041,323 and 5,106,668 describe multi-layered panels 
comprised substantially of two or several subpanels - one possibly with a higher density 
core than the other(s) - bonded together to form a complete panel. Accordingly, improving the upper surface properties of sandwich structures which are 
subject to in-use concentrated loads to make them more durable is highly desired. This  
 
will reduce life-cycle costs for airlines by decreasing the necessity for replacing damaged 
panels. The instant invention provides that improved panel by tailoring the core to have 
enhanced properties just where needed (right below the upper skin) to achieve greater 
resistance to concentrated transverse compressive loads with a much smaller or even no 
weight penalty. Honeycomb sandwich structures are widely used for aircraft flooring materials. In these 
structures, the in-plane and bending properties needed are those derived from design 
requirements of the airframe manufacturers. The out-of-plane properties are, by contrast, 
determined from test data on existing materials which are believed to meet the perceived 
requirements. It is known that the damage that causes panels to be replaced
