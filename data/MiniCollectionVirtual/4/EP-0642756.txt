<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for cutting raw vegetables into slithers, with a base structure (10) on which rising approach ramps (13, 14) are provided and which between the approach ramps (13, 14) has a plurality of longitudinal supports (26) arranged mutually parallel and with openings provided therebetween, at least one row (11) of double-edged blades, which runs substantially transversely to the cutting direction and through meander- or wave-like shaping from a metal strip has wave crest-like upper tranverse webs (18) and wave trough-like lower transverse webs, being arranged between the approach ramps (13, 14), which row of blades is supported on a holding plate (22) firmly connected to the base structure (10) via fastening means (24), the holding plate (22) having a plurality of longitudinal webs (23), between which there are attached deflectors (12) which support the underside of the wave crest-like upper transverse webs (18) of the row (11) of blades, while the upper sides of the wave trough-like lower transverse webs of the row (11) of blades are supported on the undersides of the longitudinal supports (26) of the base structure (10), the wave crest-like upper transverse webs (18) of the row (11) of blades projecting through the elongate openings of the base structure (10) above its approach ramps (13, 14).
