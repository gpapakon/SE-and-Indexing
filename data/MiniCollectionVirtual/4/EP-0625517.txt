<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a new taxane having 
the structure (1), which is isolatable from root 

bark of plants of the 
Taxus
 genus. The compound (1) is 
endowed with antitumor activity higher than the one of 

taxol, the former being active, unlike the latter, also 
against adriamicine resistant cells and as antileukemic 

drug.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new diterpene
with taxane nucleus having antitumor activity. From
spectrometric analysis, the new compound was given the
structural formula (1), corresponding to the ester at
the 13-position of 5β,20-epoxy-1,2α,4,7β,10β,13α-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one
4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate with
(2R,3S)-N-hexanoyl-3-phenylisoserine.
The compound of formula (1) has been isolated from
the root bark of the Taxus genus, with yields ranging
from 0.02 to 0.06%.The vegetal material, which the compound (1) is
extracted from, preferably consists of the roots of yew
cultivar, for example the bark of Taxus media cv Hicksii.
This cultivar is currently used with ornamental
purposes for garden dressing. This fact allows to avoid
the indiscriminate harvesting of the roots of spontaneous
yew trees, whose growth is notoriously slow, and
their consequent rapid extinction.The compound (1) is extracted by means of chlorinated
solvents, for example dichloromethane, pure or in 
admixture with alcohols, for example methyl and ethyl
alcohol. The extraction of the vegetal material can be
carried out also by using ketones, for example acetone,
pure or in admixture with water.The root bark extract contains, in addition to
compound (1), a series of other well-known taxans, such
as taxol (2), cephalomanine (3), and their respective
10-deacetyl derivatives (4) and (5). The separation of
(1) from the above taxanes requires a purification
through column chromatography.

the stationary phase. Solvent mixtures, consisting of
an aliphatic hydrocarbon, for example n-hexane, cyclohexane
or n-heptane, or aromatic hydrocarbon, for
example toluene, together with a higher polarity solvent,
such as ethyl acetate or acetone are used as 
eluents.The compound (1), once recovered from the chromatographic
fractions containing it, is isolated after
crystallization from whether acetone or diisopropyl
ether or mixtures thereof with n-hexane or n-heptane.The new compound (1) shows remarkable structural
affinities with the antitumor drug taxol (2), from
which it differs for the kind of side chain bonded at
the 13-position of the taxane nucleus. Therefore, the
compound (1) can be available, besides extraction from
vegetal material, by semisynthesis through processes
similar to the ones used for the production of taxol
(2) (I. Ojima et al, Tetrahedron 48, 6985, 1992).Due to the structural
