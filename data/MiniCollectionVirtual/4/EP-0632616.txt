<ABSTRACT>
For data security in a digital telecommunications system comprising a plurality of subscriber devices, a public key is in each case determined from a secret key which is pre-defined in one subscriber device and transmitted to another subscriber device which is involved in a connection with the subscriber device and where it is used to encrypt secondary-key information in order to adapt the aforementioned one subscriber device to repeatedly modified modes of transmission which are provided in the aforementioned other subscriber device for the aforementioned one subscriber device. The subscriber devices can devise new keys from time to time. The initial settings of scramblers can be modified as modes of transmission.

<CLAIMS>
Method for data protection in a digital
telecommunications system which comprises a plurality of

subscriber devices (TlnC, TlnD), in particular a B-ISDN
telecommunications system in which the signals are

transmitted by means of ATM cells,

characterized in that

a public key is determined from a secret key which is
specified in a subscriber device (TlnD) and is

transmitted to another subscriber device (TlnC) which is
involved in a link with the subscriber device (TlnD), in

which other subscriber device (TlnC) it is used to
encrypt secondary-key information in order to match the

said one subscriber device (TlnD) to transmission
modalities which are changed repeatedly and are provided

in the said other subscriber device (TlnC) for the said
one subscriber device (TlnD).
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized in that,

the initial position and/or the structure of a scrambler
(Scr) which is provided in the said other subscriber

device (TlnC) and of a descrambler (Descr) which is
provided in the said one subscriber device (TlnD) is

changed repeatedly at the start of a frame, in that the
said other subscriber device (TlnC) in each case uses a

random number generator to determine a random new
initial position and/or structure for the scrambler

(Scr) and reports the associated initial position and/or
structure of the associated descrambler (Descr) in 

encrypted form to the relevant subscriber device (TlnD)
using a public key which is transmitted from the said

one subscriber device (TlnD), which subscriber device
(TlnD) decrypts this message using the associated secret

key, after which the change is carried out starting from
a specific pulse frame.
Method according to Claim 2,

characterized in that,

after a specific number of pulse frames, a subscriber
device (TlnD) transmits a new public key, which has been

calculated by it, to the respective other subscriber
device (TlnC) which, for its part, in turn and after

determining a new scrambler initial position and/or
structure and newly encrypting the respective associated

descrambler initial position and/or structure of the
respective one subscriber device (TlnD), individually

reports the change to the initial position and/or
structure, which is carried out after this, starting

from a specific pulse frame.
