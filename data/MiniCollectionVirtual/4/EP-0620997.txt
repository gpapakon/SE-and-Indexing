<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to garment hangers, and in 
particular to a hanger for supporting and displaying a pair 
of trousers in a neat and attractive fashion. Prior art trouser hangers are well known which comprise 
a pair of substantially parallel bars joined together to 
define a slit therebetween and a hook attached to the upper 
bar to enable the hanger to be suspended from a rail or the 
like. A pair of trousers can be readily passed through the 
slit of the hanger, between the bars, so that the top 
portion, including the waistband, of the trousers hangs on 
one side of the hanger and the lower portion, including the 
turn-ups of the trouser legs, hangs on the other side of the 
hanger. It is also known to include transport grips below 
the lower bar, directed inwardly from either end of the 
hanger, for pinching a portion of the trousers to prevent 
the trousers from sliding off the hanger. Although such known prior art trouser hangers have been 
used for many years satisfactorily, the present invention 
aims to improve upon them by enabling a pair of trousers to 
be displayed even more neatly and attractively. 
Furthermore, a trouser hanger according to the present 
invention will reduce the vertical distance needed to 
display a pair of trousers whilst allowing more of the 
features of the trousers to be readily viewed from the front 
of the trouser hanger. In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention 
provides a trouser hanger for supporting and displaying a 
pair of trousers, comprising
 
   a support bar,
 
   means for suspending the support bar from a rail or the 
like such that the support bar, in use, is positioned 
substantially horizontally, and
 
   a fold bar spaced a significant distance below and 
attached to the support bar,
 
   such that, in use, a pair of trousers can be hung over 
the support bar and the trouser legs can pass below the fold  
 
bar and back over the support bar to present the trousers 
for display purposes in a neat and attractive fashion. By providing a facility wherein the bottom of the legs 
of a pair of trousers can pass below the fold bar and back 
over the support bar so that the bottom of the trouser legs 
are displayed down the front of the garment hanger (in front 
of the upper portion of the trousers), both the waistband 
and the turn-ups of the trousers can be viewed from the 
front of the garment hanger simultaneously. Preferably the support bar and the fold bar are formed 
integrally. In theory, however, they could be formed 
separately
