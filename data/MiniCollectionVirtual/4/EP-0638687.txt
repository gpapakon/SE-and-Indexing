<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a screening device having a rotationally symmetrical screen (2), which is arranged concentrically in an essentially rotationally symmetrical housing and in whose internal space a rotor drum (3) is located concentrically, which has screening elements (6), which are arranged on its outer periphery and are guided along the screen (2), a guidance at least of parts of the suspension to be screened in a circulation around the walls of the drum (3) taking place and the screening elements (6) being designed such that they generate an eddy flow of the suspension in the housing (1), and the housing having at least one discharge channel (18), for heavy contaminants, on its outer periphery and a central draw-off (19) for light dirt in one of its end walls (8). The invention is characterised in that the housing end wall (end wall 8), which has the draw-off for light dirt, has a diameter reducing in the direction away from the screen (2) and from the rotor drum (3), radially from the outside towards the inside, by a maximum of 11 mm per 3 mm axial housing length and a minimum of 2 mm per 3 mm axial housing length, that is to say is of conical design.
