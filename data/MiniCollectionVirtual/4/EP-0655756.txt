<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of manufacturing a solid 
electrolytic capacitor, including the steps of forming an oxide film 

serving as dielectric substance around a porous compact (1) composed 
of valve action metal having an anode lead (1A) projecting therefrom, 

forming a resist layer (3) around the anode lead (1A) and on a portion 
of the porous compact (1) disposed in the vicinity of the anode lead 

(1A), forming a conducting polymer compound layer (4, 4A) on both the 
resist layer (3) and the oxide film, and removing concurrently the 

resist layer (3) and a part of the conducting polymer compound layer 
(4A) disposed
 on the resist layer (3). For instance, when the resist 
layer (3) is composed of glass, the resist layer (3) is removed by 

applying mechanical impact thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a solid 
electrolytic capacitor, and more particularly to a method of 
manufacturing a solid electrolytic capacitor including the conducting 
polymer compound as solid electrolyte. With development of science technology, electrical devices 
are required to be down-sized much more and have greater reliability. 
With respect to a capacitor, it is also desired to develop a solid 
electrolytic capacitor having a performance sufficiently covering a 
high frequency band, and also having a reliability and a large capacity. 
In order to manufacture such a capacitor, much of research and 
development has been conducted. In general, a solid electrolytic capacitor includes a first 
electrode or an anode composed of porous compact of valve action 
metal such as tantalum (Ta) and aluminum (Al), an oxide film derived 
from the valve action metal and serving as a dielectric substance, and 
a second electrode or a cathode partially composed of solid electrolyte 
such as manganese dioxide (MnO2) and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane 
(TCNQ) complex salt. The solid electrolyte 
is required to have functions for electrically connecting an entire 
dielectric substance disposed in the porous compact to leads of the 
electrodes, and also for repairing electrical short-circuit derived from 
defects of the oxide film. Accordingly, it is not allowed to use metal 
having high electrical conductivity, but having no function for 
repairing electrical short-circuit, as a solid electrolyte. For instance,  
 
manganese dioxide (MnO2), which can be converted to insulative 
material due to heat generated by short-circuit current, has been often 
used as a solid electrolyte. However, a solid electrolytic capacitor having manganese 
dioxide (MnO2) as a part of an electrode cannot have a sufficiently high 
electrical conductivity, and hence the impedance in high frequency 
band cannot be reduced. In addition, a solid electrolytic capacitor 
having TCNQ complex salt as a part of an electrode can have only a poor 
thermal resistance, because TCNQ complex salt is easy to be thermally 
decomposed. Recently, new materials have been developed in the field of 
high polymer. For instance, there has been developed a conducting 
polymer including conjugate high polymer such as polyacetylene, poly-p-phenylene, 
polypyrrole and polyaniline to which is added a dopant or 
an electron donative and/or electron attractive compound. Among 
these conducting polymers, polypyrrole is widely used as a solid 
ele
