<ABSTRACT>
The air control system for a hydropneumatic reservoir (1) of the hydraulic (water) pipeline (2) comprises a chamber (6), a means (11, 12) for filling the chamber with water, a means (10, 13) for emptying the chamber of water, a means (14, 15, 16) for automatically introducing air into the chamber during emptying, a means (18, 19) for automatically injecting the air from the chamber into the reservoir during filling, and a control means (22) connected to at least one detector (23) for detecting that a threshold level of water contained in the reservoir has been exceeded and to the means for filling and emptying the chamber. If the detector indicates that there is an insufficient volume of air contained within the reservoir the control means triggers cycles filling/draining the chamber until the detector indicates that the volume of air in the reservoir has become sufficient.
