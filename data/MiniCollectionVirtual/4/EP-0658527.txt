<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making a castable ceramic from waterglass and a powder containing silicon and aluminium. To reduce the open porosity, epoxy resin based on bisphenol A is mixed into the castable ceramic. The castable ceramic is subsequently subjected to at least one heat treatment.

Process for producing a casting ceramic comprising 
water glass and a powder containing silicon and 

aluminium, characterized in that 40% by weight of water 
glass which contains 25% by weight of K

 phase in a proportion 
of 20%, 17% by weight of epoxy resin based on bisphenol 

A and 5% by weight of solvent-free silicone resin are 

mixed in, and in that the casting ceramic is, to cure it 
and to cross-link the epoxy resin, subjected for from 4 

to 5 hours to a first heat treatment at from 80°C to 
100°C and subsequently subjected for from 8 to 10 hours 

to a second heat treatment at from 160° to 200°C. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that oxide ceramics in the form of aluminium dioxide 

[sic], zirconium dioxide, magnesium oxide, silicon 

dioxide or beryllium oxide, or non-oxide powders in the 
form of aluminium nitride, silicon nitride, silicon 

carbide, tungsten carbide, boron carbide, titanium 
carbide or molybdenum carbide having an average particle 

size between 1 and 500 µm are mixed into the still-liquid 
casting ceramic as fillers. 
Process according to either Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that fillers in the form of short fibres 

of glass, aluminium dioxide [sic], silicon dioxide, 

carbon or silicon carbide having a length of from 0.15 to 
50 mm are mixed into the still-liquid casting ceramic. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, to improve the processability of 

the casting ceramic, at least one polyhydric alcohol in 
the form of glycerol is mixed into the casting ceramic.
