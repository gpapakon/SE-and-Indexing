<ABSTRACT>
An acrylate hot-melt-based self-adhesive composition characterised by a K value of at least 60, in particular 65-80, obtainable by concentrating or degassing a solution of such a composition in a degassing (vented) extruder to give a system which can be processed as a hot melt.

<CLAIMS>
Use of an extruder for concentrating or devolatilizing
a solution of a self-adhesive

material based on acrylate hotmelt with a K value
of at least 60 to give a system having a residual

solvent content of less than 1% by weight, the
self-adhesive materials used being copolymers of

meth(acrylic) acid and esters thereof having
1 - 25 C atoms, which system can be processed as

hotmelt for a plaster or for an industrial self-adhesive
tape.
Use according to Claim 1, a self-adhesive material
based on acrylate hotmelt with a K value of 65 to

80 being used.
Use according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the solution of the material contains 5 - 80 % by
weight, in particular 30 - 70 % by weight, of

solvent.
Use according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

commercial solvents are used, in particular low-boiling
hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols and/or

esters.
Use according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

single-screw, twin-screw or multiscrew extruders
having one or, in particular two or more

devolatilization units are used.
