<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an edge protecting border (11) as corner reinforcement for the filler coat which is applied onto the heat-insulating layer, serves as a carrier for the exposed plaster layer and is reinforced with plastic-reinforced glass-fibre mats (GFK). In order to provide an edge protecting border (11) with increased stability, in particular dimensional stability, along with simple production, it is provided that the angled border profile (17) comprises a laid glass-fibre or natural-fibre strip (1, 12, 5) as laid reinforcing strip, the laid reinforcing strip (1, 12, 5) being formed by at least two intersecting layers which are laid one above the other and comprise fibre bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9), and the intersecting fibre bundle (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) being linked to one another at their points of intersection by at least one further, separate thread (4, 10).

Edge protecting border as a corner reinforcement for the filler layer
reinforced with plastic-strengthened glass fibre fabric mats (GFK), serving

as a support for the parging layer and to be applied to a thermal insulation
layer, characterized in that the angle section (17) is formed by a

glass or natural fibre interlaid scrim strip (1, 12, 5) as a strengthening
interlaid scrim strip, impregnated with a hardenable adhesive (14) and

permitting the passage of a filler adhesive, the strengthening interlaid
scrim strip (1, 12, 5) being formed by at least two superimposed, crossing

layers of fibre bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) and which are interconnected at
their intersections by at least one further, separate thread (4, 10).
Edge protecting border according to claim 1, characterized in that the
intersecting fibre bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) are sewn together by the

further, separate thread (4, 10).
Edge protecting border according to claim 1, characterized in that the
fibre bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) of the individual interlaid scrim layers

are in each case stretched parallel to one another.
Edge protecting border according to claim 1 or 3, characterized in that
the fibre bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) of the individual interlaid scrim

layers intersect one another under in each case an angle of approximately
45Â° for forming square or diagonal meshes.
Edge protecting border according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the adhesive (14) is UV-hardenable.
Edge protecting border according to one of the claims 1 or 5, characterized
in that the fibre bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) forming the interlaid

scrim strips have a larger number of individual fibres than the threads
(4, 10) used for interconnection purposes.
Edge protecting border according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the angle section (17) formed by the strengthening

interlaid scrim strip (1, 12, 5) additionally incorporates a GFK reinforcing
fabric strip (13), which directly engages on the strengthening interlaid 

scrim strip (1, 5, 12) and is fixed thereto by means of a hardenable
adhesive (14), the marginal portion (15) of the reinforcing fabric strip

(13) projecting over and beyond the outer longitudinal edges (16) of the
strengthened angle section (17) of the edge protecting border (11).
Edge protecting border according to claim 7, characterized in that the
strengthening interlaid scrim strip (1, 5, 12) is placed on the inside of

the GFK reinforcing fabric strip (13).
Edge protecting border according to claim 7, characterized in that the
strengthening interlaid scrim strip (1, 5, 12) is placed on the outside

of the GKF reinforcing fabric strip (13).
Edge protecting border according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the angle section (17) formed by the strengthening interlaid

scrim strip (1, 12, 5) additionally incorporates a reinforcing interlaid
scrim strip, which engages directly on the strengthening interlaid

scrim strip (1, 5, 12) and is fixed thereto by means of a hardenable adhesive
(14), the marginal portion (15) of the reinforcing interlaid scrim

strip projecting over and beyond the outer longitudinal edges (16) of the
strengthened angle section (17) of the edge protecting border (11).
Edge protecting border according to claim 10, characterized in that
the strengthening interlaid scrim strip (1, 5, 12) is placed on the inside

of the reinforcing interlaid scrim strip.
Edge protecting border according to claim 10, characterized in that the
strengthening interlaid scrim strip (1, 12, 5) is placed on the outside of

the reinforcing interlaid scrim strip.
Edge protecting border according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the strengthening interlaid scrim strips (1, 12, 5) have a

small mesh construction.
Edge protecting border according to claim 13, characterized in that
the mesh size is between 0.5 and 3 mm. 
Edge protecting border according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the strengthening interlaid scrim strips (1, 12, 5)

have a large mesh construction.
Edge protecting border according to claim 15, characterized in that the
mesh size is between 3 and 10 mm.
Edge protecting border according to one of the claims 1 to 16,
characterized in that the threads (4, 10) linking or sewing the fibre

bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) are much thinner than the fibre bundles and in
particular have a thickness of the same order of magnitude as the thickness

of individual threads of the fibre bundles (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9).
