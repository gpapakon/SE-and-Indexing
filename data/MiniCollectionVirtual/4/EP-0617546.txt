<ABSTRACT>
A method for calibrating a printer determines a tone reproduction curve for the 
printer. A plurality of bands (12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,52) of different accurate gray level 

standards and a corresponding number of smoothly increasing sequences 
(14,18,22,26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54) of gray level specifications for the printer are printed 

adjacent to one another. Adjacent bands and sequences are compared, and a point along each 
band where the band appears equal to the adjacent gray level specification sequence is 

determined. The points are interpolated and the interpolated values are used to form a tone 
reproduction curve for the printer. The tone reproduction curve, representing the 

correspondence between the gray level specification of the printer and the actual gray levels 
produced by the printer, can then be used to calibrate the printer. The calibrating method can 

also be used for color printers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for determining a tone reproduction curve
for a printer and, more particularly, to calibration of a printer using a tone reproduction curve,
the calibration requiring no measuring equipment.Electronic printers are generally capable of producing gray tones, as well as standard
black and white tones in order to produce gray tones. The printers accept gray level
specifications as input and produce corresponding gray areas on a printed page. This
production of the corresponding gray areas is often performed by a halftoning operation
wherein a fine pattern of black and white dots is printed, the dots appearing as varying gray
tones in accordance with the number of black and white dots used when viewed from a
distance. The allowed gray level specifications generally vary over some finite range such as 0
to 1 or 0 to 255. The colors at the extremes (i.e., 0 and 1 or 0 and 255) are white and black,
numbers between the extremes yielding intermediate gray tones. However, while the gray
level specifications may vary linearly, a linear change in gray levels typically does not result.
Instead, there may be a particular threshold before lighter toned grays become visible.
Similarly, darker toned grays may prematurely appear black.In order to accurately produce a desired gray level, one must know the
correspondence between the gray level specification of the printer and the actual gray level
produced by the printer. A tone reproduction curve (TRC) provides an illustration of the
corresponding relationship. If the TRC is known, one can compensate for the nonlinearities of
the printer.The TRC, which is dependent upon the stability of the printing device, may change
frequently, or the halftone used to produce gray levels may be altered. Thus, to accurately
assess the corresponding relationship, the TRC must be measured frequently.In order to determine the TRC, a sample set of gray level specifications can be printed
and the gray levels actually produced by the device can be measured by a device such as a
densitometer. The measured points can then be fitted to a curve, this curve being the TRC.
Such a method is known from US-A-5 170 257.This method of determining the TRC, however, requires special equipment such as
the densitometer to measure the gray level. Further, a skilled operator is desired to accurately
assess the results of use of the densitometer. The special equipment and skilled operator are
not always available for use with every printer.Accordingly, it would be

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining a tone reproduction curve for calibrating a printer
comprising:


providing a band of an accurate gray level or color standard;
providing a smoothly increasing sequence of gray level or color specifications for the
printer;
comparing said band of said gray level or color standard with said sequence of gray
level or color specifications;
determining a point along said band where said band of said gray level or color
standard appears equal to said sequence of said gray level or color specifications; and

calibrating said printer using said point.
A method according to claim 1, including:

providing a plurality of bands of different ones of said gray level or color standards;
providing a corresponding number of a plurality of different sequences of said gray
level or color specifications such that one sequence of said gray level or color specifications is

adjacent to one band of said gray level or color standards;
comparing each said band of said gray level or color standards with said adjacent
sequence of said gray level or color specifications; and
determining a point along each of said bands where said bands of said gray level or
color standards appear equal to adjacent ones of said sequences of said gray level or color

specifications.
A method according to claim 2, including;

interpolating between each of said points;
using the interpolated values to form a tone reproduction curve for the printer; and
using said tone reproduction curve to calibrate said printer.
The method according to claim 1 to 3, wherein said band of said gray level or color
standard comprises a coarse pattern.
A method according to claim 4, wherein said coarse pattern comprises stripes or
wherein said coarse pattern comprises checks.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said sequence of gray level
or color specifications comprises a varying halftone gray level or color specification.
