<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a lead free alloy. The alloy is a low solidus 
temperature, multi-component solder alloy containing at least 

about 50 weight percent Bi, up to about 50 weight percent Sn 
(basis total Sn and Bi), and an effective amount of a physical 

and mechanical property enhancing third component. The third 
component can be Cu, In, Ag, and combinations of Cu and Ag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to lead free solders and especially to
lead free, tin-bismuth solder alloys. These alloys are low
toxicity solder alloys that are particularly useful in
microelectronic applications. The solder alloys of the
invention are particularly useful in joining integrated
circuit chips to chip carriers and substrates, as printed
circuit boards, joining chip carriers to substrates, and
joining circuitization lands and pads in multilayer printed
circuit boards.Soldering is a low temperature, generally reversible,
metallurgical joining process. Low temperature and
reversibility are especially important in electronics
applications because of the materials involved and the
necessity for reworking and making engineering changes.Solder joining is a wetting process followed by a chemical
reaction. Molten solder wets selectively. The selective
wettability of solders allow molten solder to be confined to
desired sites. This is especially important in flip chip
bonding, and in working with solder masks.The soldering process can be accomplished as quickly as the
wetting takes place, for example, on the order of a few
seconds. This makes soldering particularly desirable for
automated, high speed, high throughput processes. Wettability is also a function of the materials to be joined,
with Cu, Ni, Au, and Pd, as well as alloys rich in one or more
of these metals, being particularly amenable to soldering.The chemical reaction following wetting is between the molten
solder and the joining metallurgy to form an intermetallic
phase region at the interface. The intermetallic phases
formed by solders in electronic packaging are stoichiometric
compounds, typically binary compounds, and typically
containing Sn if Sn is present in the solder alloy. When the
base, pad, or land is Cu, and the solder alloy is rich is Sn,
the intermetallic formed during soldering is Cu-Sn. Exemplary
Cu-Sn binaries include Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5.Solder alloys are characterized by the melting temperature
being a strong function of composition. While a pure metal is
characterized by a single, invariant, melting temperature, the
freezing and melting points of alloys are complex. The
freezing point of an alloy is determined by the liquidus line.
Above the liquidus line only a liquid phase or phases can
exist. The melting point of an alloy is determined by the
solidus line. Below the solidus line only a solid phase or
phases can exist. In the region between these two lines,
i.e., between the liquidus line and the solidus line, solid
and liquid
