<DESCRIPTION>
 STABLE SUSPENSION OF A PARTICULATE COMPONENTThe present invention relates to a composition. In particular, the present invention relates to a composition for providing a stable suspension of a particulate component.The preparation or supply of materials in a powder form is problematic. The powder may dust. Dust may be noxious, may have a high or unpleasant odour, settles on surfaces and may require cleaning therefrom. Furthermore, some powders, for example enzymes, may cause allergy. Moreover, powders are difficult to meter/dose in industrial applications, and this difficulty may increase production costs. Powders are often supplied in bags/sacks which require manual opening. Furthermore, because of dosing problems, industrial processes using powders must often be performed in a batchwise manner.Thus, in many applications, for example the production of foodstuffs, it is desirable to provide a suspension of particulate material, such as functional ingredients, in a dispersant. The suspension may be used in a manufacturing process or may constitute an intermediate or a final product for sale to a consumer.EP-A-0572051 relates to a liquid bread improver. The bread improver comprises a vegetable oil having a solid fat content of less than 2.0, a hydrogenated vegetable oil which is solid at room temperature, a partly hydrogenated vegetable oil which is solid at room temperature, emulsifiers including at least some diacetyl tartaric esters, and enzymes. The crystal size of the fat present in the composition is less than 25 μm. In this prior art application, the average particle size of the particles present in the composition is always less than 50 μm.WO-A-94/08470 relates to a salad dressing. The document discusses the problems of phase separation of the oil and water phases of the dressing. This prior art document teaches that a high melting fat which may be added to the oil is thought to form a fragile agglomerate of fine crystals in which aqueous droplets are captured, so that phase separation is prevented. 

US-A-5185173 relates to a pumpable bread improver comprising a dispersion of solid particles in a liquid glyceride oil, wherein the solid particles include solid fat particles. The composition comprises greater than 18 wt % solid fat particles. The solid fat particles have a specific density similar to that of the oil and therefore should not rapidly settle to form a sediment. The presence of the fat in particulate form may prevent the sedimentation of the other solid particles.US-A-4889740 relates
