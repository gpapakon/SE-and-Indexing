<ABSTRACT>
The present invention permits the re-writing of data 
selectively only in cells in which data is written 

incompletely. A non-volatile memory is set in a re-write mode 
when a bit line voltage is high (H). In the re-write mode, a 

sense amplifier (20) and a selected cell (Cri) are activated. 
Because latched data in the sense amplifier (20) is high (H), 

the electrons in the selected cell (Cri) produce FN-tunneling, 
thereby writing data "0" in the selected cell. 

Because the bit line level of voltage (BLR) of the other 
cells in which data is written completely is reduced to a low 

level (L), the latched data in the sense amplifier (20) is 
reduced to a low level (L). Accordingly, when the word line 

of a selected cell (Cri) is connected to other cells in which 
data is written completely, because data is prevented from 

being re-written in said other cells, the threshold levels 
(Vth) of the various cells remain equal and do not become 

distributed broadly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a NOR-type non-volatile
semiconductor memory device for writing and erasing data by a
tunnel current.A non-volatile semiconductor memory, such as the flash
EEPROM, is reaching the limits of a write operation using CHE
(Channel Hot Electron) because the power-supply for the
memory tends to be of a lower voltage (3.0 or 3.3 volts).A NOR-type non-volatile memory, which writes and erases
data using the FN-tunnel current (Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling
Current) with a low voltage power-supply, is preferable to
the CHE memory.The non-volatile memory which writes and erases data
using the tunnel current is able to write and erase with a
low voltage power-supply or a boosted voltage because little
current flows in the memory.However, the write operation using FN-tunneling has a
disadvantage of taking a longer time than the write operation
using CHE. For example, while the write operation using CHE
takes tens of microseconds, the write operation using the FN-tunneling
takes several milliseconds.In order to solve this problem, for example, it would be
possible to write by latching one word line of data from a
word line (corresponding to a row) established in a memory
cell, using a single word line as a writing unit, in other
words, writing latch data on a page basis. Since the time
necessary for writing on a per byte basis could be reduced,
the writing time should be comparable to that for the CHE
type operation. However, this leads to a new problem, described below,
which occurs in the paginal write operation. After the
paginal write operation, a verify operation determines
whether or not the data are written in the cell completely
and accurately enough to be later correctly read.Threshold levels for writing for the cells connected to
the word line are not at all the same and there is some
degree of variation. Therefore, the more often re-writing is
undertaken, the wider the variation in threshold levels will
become and the more significantly broad the dispersion of
such threshold levels for the cells connected to the word
line will become.When the threshold levels for the cells become
significantly different, the margins will be insufficient,
thereby making the reading itself as well as the control of
such reading difficult.EP-A-0547640 discloses a non-volatile semiconductor
memory device using a NAND type or NOR type flush EEPROM
comprising a plurality of memory cells, wherein write
(program) and erase operations are executed repetitively and
verify operations are performed after the erase

claim 1, further comprising a converter circuit for reducing said first voltage

on said bit line when a memory cell (Cri) has been completely
programmed, thereby causing said sense amplifier (20) to latch low on

said bit line.
