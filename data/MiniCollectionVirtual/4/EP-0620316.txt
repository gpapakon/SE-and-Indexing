Elastic rail pads for open or closed superstructure
for rail vehicles, in which the rails (10) are held on

both sides via positively attached elastomer sections
(18) or similar by bearing sections, e.g. angle sheet

irons (16), vertically movably at a vertical distance
(A) above a bearing body (11) of e.g. concrete slabs,

grids or sleepers on the ground, the bearing sections
being fastened on the bearing body on the ground by

means of anchor bolts (13), characterized in that

a) the bearing sections or angle sheet irons (16)
for the rails (10) are supported by horizontal

sections (17) on support bodies (15) disposed at
a distance from the rail on both sides, and fixed

on these bodies by clamping plates (19),
b) an eccentric bushing (22) is supported rotatably
in a hole (21) in each clamping plate (19), which

bushing has means for rotational catching,
c) the anchor bolts (13) extend upwards through
holes (14) in the support bodies (15) and

eccentric bushings (22) and
d) the eccentric bushings (22), clamping plates (19)
and support bodies (15) are arrested or fastened

by nuts (24) screwed onto the anchor bolts (13).
Elastic rail pads according to claim 1, characterized
in that covering bodies (27) for the support bodies

(15), clamping plates (19), eccentric bushings (22)
and anchor bolts (13) are disposed on both sides of

and parallel to or next to each rail (10) at a short
distance from it, which covering bodies are supported

on the clamping plates (19) and the bearing body (11)
on the ground. 
Elastic rail pads according to claim 2, characterized
in that the bearing sections or angle sheet irons (16)

secure the covering bodies (27) in their installed
positions.
Elastic rail pads according to claim 2 or claim 3,
characterized in that the grooves between the outer

side of Vignoles rails (10) and the covering bodies
(27) or the grooves between the outsides and insides

of grooved rails and the covering bodies (27) are
lined by filling strips (32) e.g. of synthetic

material.
Elastic rail pads according to any one of claims 2-4,
characterized in that the covering bodies (27)

consist of synthetic material, rubber, concrete or
metal.
Elastic rail pads according to claim 1, characterized
in that the eccentric bushings (22) overlap the

clamping plates (19) with an annular collar (23).
Elastic rail pads according to claim 1, characterized
in that the support bodies (15) consist of inverted U-shaped

rail pieces, rectangular tube pieces or bodies
of synthetic material, which are disposed at right

angles to the longitudinal rail axis on the bearing
body (11) on the ground.
