<ABSTRACT>
In a method of operating a thermal printer, in particular a thermal printer for a franking machine, a thermal printhead (10) rests with its electrodes (10a to 10n) arranged in series one next to the other on the resistive layer (14) of a thermal printing ribbon (12). A current path whose resistance (Rs) is determined is formed by means of at least one electrode (10a), a heating area (14a) of the resistive layer (14) and a conductive layer (16) located below it. When a predetermined resistance value is exceeded, a fault signal is produced. Furthermore, a device for carrying out the method, a thermal printhead and a sliding ribbon which is matched thereto are described.
