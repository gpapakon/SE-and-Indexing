<ABSTRACT>
A torque proportioning differential (10) is modified to vary bias ratio in three distinct stages in response to predetermined levels of drive torque. A pair of side gears (26 and 28) carried within a differential housing (12) generate respective thrust forces (44 and 46) that can be opposed by both high-friction gear mounting surfaces (68 and 70) and low-friction gear mounting surfaces (84 and 86). Outer disc springs (72 and 74) transmit a first portion of the thrust forces (44 and 46) to the low-friction gear mounting surfaces (84 and 86). Inner disc springs (64 and 66) transmit together with the outer disc springs (72 and 74) a second portion of the thrust forces (44 and 46) up to a second magnitude. Either the inner disc springs (64 and 66) or the outer disc springs (72 and 74) transmit the remaining portion of the thrust forces (44 and 46) above the second magnitude.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THREE-STAGE TORQUE PROPORTIONING DIFFERENTIALFIELD OF INVENTIONThe invention relates to the field of differentials used in automotive drive lines for transmitting drive power from a single input shaft to two output shafts and, more particularly, to such differentials that develop a resistance to relative rotation between the output shafts as a function of drive torque that is transmitted by the differential.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONTorque proportioning differentials develop a frictional resistance to relative rotation (i.e., differen¬ tiation) between output shafts substantially proportional to the total amount of torque transmitted to the output shafts. The resistance to the relative rotation of the output shafts is reflected as a torque difference between the output shafts. The torque difference varies substantially linearly with the sum of torque of the output shafts as expressed in the following equation:Td = k Tswhere "T^" is the torque difference between output shafts, "TΞ" is the torque sum of the same shafts, and "k" is a proportionality constant.However, this torque proportioning characteristic is more commonly expressed as a "bias ratio", which is a ratio of the respective amounts of torque in the two output shafts. The bias ratio "B" can also be expressed in terms of the torque difference "T-j" and torque sum "Ts" as follows: 

 Ts + TdB = τs - τdTorque proportioning differentials generally exhibit a relatively constant bias ratio, which is selected to meet particular traction objectives. For example, a torque proportioning differential with a bias ratio of 3 to 1 can deliver a total amount of drive torque to a pair of drive wheels equal to four times the amount of drive torque exerted by the drive wheel having the least traction.However, the same distribution of drive torque is required to permit any relative rotation between drive axles. For example, an increased amount of the total drive torque is delivered to the slower rotating drive wheel regardless of traction conditions. This increased amount of torque is equal to the torque difference that opposes relative rotation between drive axles.Any torque difference "Td" between front or rear drive wheels contributes to a vehicle yaw moment that could influence vehicle lateral stability. While differentiating under power, the torque difference between output shafts required to permit differentiation produces a vehicle understeer moment. However, if the required torque difference cannot be sustained by available traction, differentiation ceases
