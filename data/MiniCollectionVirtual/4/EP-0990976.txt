<ABSTRACT>
A binder type information data terminal has an appearance
of a binder and does not look like an information data terminal.

Among devices constituting the information data terminal which
have been prepared individually, a main device (4) is provided

on the end paper portion (14) of the notebook body (1), while a
display device (5) is provided on the end paper portion (15). The

main device and the display device are integrally formed with a
cover using leather. A keyboard (9), which is made in the form

of an input binder leaf (10), is held onto the body via binding
rings (3). A Krause chain (13) is engaged with hooks (12) provided

on each end paper portion (14, 15), so that the display screen
(7) can be set to an optimal position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information data terminal
and, more particularly, to a portable information data terminal.With the development of "mobile computing", a variety of
compact information data terminals that are easy to carry and have
multiple functions (hereinafter referred to as "portable
terminals") have become available on the consumer market. In
order to differentiate such products from similar products
marketed by competitor companies and ensure that they will be
chosen by consumers from among all the portable terminals on the
market, it is necessary for the manufacturer to stimulate
consumers, not only by drawing attention to the function of the
apparatus, but also by manufacturing products with an attractive
appearance.In the prior art, although it has always been attempted to
make such apparatuses as aesthetically pleasing as possible,
there has been no apparatus available on the market provided with
additional value by combining the functions of other item that
does not have the appearance of a data processing terminal itself.
Many users may heavily weigh the appearance of a portable terminal
because they intend to operate the apparatus in public. Some
users may want an apparatus which does not look like an actual
portable terminal.For example, many of the same workers and students who carry 
a portable terminal may also use a binder-type portable filing
system (such as the "Filofax (trademark)" brand system) to which
various refilling materials can be interchangeably introduced.
Now, as there are no portable terminals integrally toned with
such a filing system, people who wish to use both a portable
terminal and a filing system must carry two seperate units.The present invention was made to overcome the foregoing
problems and it is an object of the present invention to provide
a binder type information data terminal having an appearance
similar to a binder, and not look like an information data
terminal.In view of the above-mentioned object, according to one
aspect of the present invention, there is provided a binder type
information data terminal comprising : an information data
terminal including a main device in the form of a plate, having
a processor, a display device in the form of a plate, having a
display screen, and an input device for data input; and a binder
body constituting a binder. This information data terminal
realizes the appearance of a binder by housing said main device,
said display device, and said input device, which have been
prepared individually, in

<CLAIMS>
A binder type information data terminal comprising:

an information data terminal including a main device in the
form of a plate having a processor, a display device in the form

of a plate having a display screen, and an input device for data
input; and
a binder body constituting a binder,
said information data terminal having the appearance of a
binder by housing said main device, said display device, and said

input device, which have been prepared individually, in said
binder body.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 1, wherein at least one of said main device and said display

device is provided on the end paper portion of said binder body
so as to be integrally formed with a cover.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 2, wherein a rear member forming the rear part of the binder

is detachably fixed to at least one of the cover faces of the binder,
and connection to terminals of said main device is allowed when

the rear member is detached from said cover face and opened.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 1, wherein, said input device is a keyboard formed as an

input binder leaf having a leaf shape with filing holes and is
filed in the binder body via filing rings.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 1 fur
ther comprising a display device setting mechanism for
setting the display screen of the display device at an optimal

angle by angularly holding the opened cover.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 5, wherein the display device setting mechanism further

includes an adjusting mechanism for adjusting the set angle of
the display device.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 5, wherein the display device setting mechanism has a leg

provided at the display device side on the cover to be opened when
the apparatus is used and an aperture provided at the main device

side which forms a base body when the apparatus is used, said leg
being inserted into said aperture for holding said display device.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 7, wherein a hinge is further provided for pivotably

mounting said leg to said display device.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 1 further comprising a binder leaf for containing

accessories of said information data terminal.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 1, wherein at least one of said main device and the input

device is formed as a binder leaf having a leaf shape with filing
holes and is filed in the binder body via filing rings.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 1, wherein at least one of the main device and the display

device is provided with a mounting member to be detachably mounted
onto the end paper portion of said binder body.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 11, wherein a substrate on which a processor or the like

is mounted is removably housed in said main device.
The binder type information data terminal as defined in
claim 11, wherein the rear member forming the rear part of the

binder is detachably fixed to at least one of the cover faces of
