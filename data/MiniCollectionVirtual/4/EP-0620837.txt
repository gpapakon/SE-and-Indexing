<DESCRIPTION>
COMPOSITIONS USEFUL AS REFRIGERANTS.The present invention relates generally to refrigerant compositions for cooling and heating applications and to the use of such compositions in heat transfer devices. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with refrigerant compositions which are designed to replace dichlorodifluoromethane (Refrigerant R-12).Mechanical refrigeration systems and related heat transfer devices such as heat pumps and air-conditioning systems are well known. In such devices, a refrigerant liquid of a suitable boiling point evaporates at low pressure taking heat from a surrounding zone. The resulting vapour is then compressed and passed to a condenser where it condenses and gives off heat to a second zone, the condensate being returned through an expansion valve to the evaporator, so completing the cycle. The mechanical energy required for compressing the vapour and pumping the liquid may be provided by an electric motor or an internal combustion engine.In addition to having a suitable boiling point and a high latent heat of vaporisation, the properties preferred of a refrigerant include low toxicity, non- flammability , non-corrosivity, high stability and freedom from objectionable odour.Hitherto, heat transfer devices have tended to use fully and partially halogenated chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants. Particular mention may be made of dichlorodifluoromethane (Refrigerant R-12) which possesses a suitable combination of properties and has for many years been the most widely used refrigerant. 

 In recent years, however, there has been increasing international concern that the fully and partially halogenated chlorofluorocarbons may be damaging the earth's protective ozone layer and there is general agreement that their manufacture and use should be severely restricted and eventually phased out completely.Whilst heat transfer devices of the type to which the present invention relates are essentially closed systems, loss of refrigerant to the atmosphere can occur due to leakage during operation of the equipment or during maintenance procedures. It is important, therefore, to replace fully and partially halogenated chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants by materials having substantially lower, preferably zero, ozone depletion potentials .In addition to the possibility of ozone depletion, it has been suggested that significant concentrations of chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants in the atmosphere might contribute to global warming (the so-called greenhouse effect). It is desirable, therefore,
