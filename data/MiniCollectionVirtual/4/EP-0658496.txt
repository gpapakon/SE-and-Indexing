<ABSTRACT>
A drive wheel conveyor comprising a tubular side frame (11) extending in a 
transport direction and having an inner side wall (21), outer side wall (22), 

top wall (23) and bottom wall (24); a drive shaft (41) supported by the inner 
(22) and outer side walls (23) so as to extend through the side frame (11), 

transversely thereof and having an inward projection (49) extending inward 
through the inner side wall (21); a sprocket (45) fixed to the drive shaft 

(41) and positioned between the inner (21) and outer side walls (22); an 
endless drive chain (46) in engagement with the sprocket (45) and disposed 

inside the side frame (11) so as to be movable in circulation; and a transport 
wheel (51) having a shaft bore (53) with the inward projection (49) fitted 

therein and drivable by frictional resistance between the inner periphery 
of the wheel (51) defining the shaft bore (53)and the outer surface of the 

inward projection (49).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive wheel conveyor 
comprising: 
a tubular side frame extending in a transport direction and 
having an inner side wall, an outer side wall, a top wall and 
a bottom wall, a drive shaft supported by the inner and outer side walls so 
as to extend through the side frame transversely thereof and 
having an inward projection extending inward through the inner 
side wall, a sprocket fixed to the drive shaft, an endless drive chain in engagement with the sprocket so as 
to be movable in circulation, and a transport wheel having a shaft bore with the inward 
projection fitted therein and drivable by frictional 
restistance between an inner peripheral surface of the 
transport wheel defining the shaft bore and the outer surface 
of the inward projection. A drive wheel conveyor of this kind is disclosed in EP-A-⊘ 
⊘51 867. This drive wheel conveyor comprises a tubular side 
frame with two U-shaped elements defining an inner side wall, 
an outer side wall, a top wall and a top bottom wall. A drive 
shaft is supported by the side walls so as to extend through 
the side frame transversely thereof and has an inward 
projection extending through the inner side wall. The  
 
projection carries a transport wheel, which is fitted around 
the drive shaft and drivable by frictional resistance between 
the transport wheel and the drive shaft. The other end of the drive shaft projects outward of the side 
frame into a space, which is defined by the two legs of the 
outer U-shaped elements and carries a sprocket having an 
endless chain in engagement therewith. The space defined by 
the two U-legs is closed by a cover in order to prevent the 
sprocket and endless drive chain assembly from being soiled. However, the known drive wheel conveyor structures is 
sometimes considered to be too big and susceptible to 
disturbances. For example there is the likelihood, that the 
endless chain becomes disengaged from the sprocket, so that 
the cover has to be removed for reassembling the chain, which 
leads to long standstills of the conveyor. Accordingly it is the object of the invention to provide a 
drive wheel conveyor which is compact in design and not 
susceptible against disturbances. According to the present invention this object is solved in 
that the sprocket and the endless drive chain in engagement 
therewith are positioned between the inner and outer side 
walls, 
the top wall is formed with a slit extending in the transport 
direction and a top cover is attached to an upper surface
