<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oxidation catalysts, and in 
particular to catalysts suitable for the combustion Of a feedstock 
with an oxygen-containing gas, eg air, particularly with an excess 
of the oxygen-containing gas to effect complete combustion. In order to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen 
(NOx) when a fuel, eg gaseous hydrocarbons such as natural gas 
and/or hydrogen, is combusted with air, it is desirable to employ 
fuel/air mixtures of such composition that the adiabatic flame 
temperature is relatively low, generally below 1500°C, and 
desirably below about 1300°C. For many applications this means 
using a composition that is so rich in air that normal combustion 
is unstable and may not be self-sustaining. Catalytic combustion 
wherein a mixture of the fuel and air is passed through a bed of a 
combustion catalyst, enables such problems to be overcome. One application wherein catalytic combustion is 
desirable is in gas turbines. At initial start-up of a gas 
turbine, a mixture of the fuel and air, preheated, for example by 
a pilot burner, to a temperature typically of the order of 
600-800°C when the fuel is methane or natural gas, is fed, 
normally at superatmospheric pressure, eg at a pressure in the 
range 2 to 20 bar abs., to the inlet of the combustion catalyst 
bed. Combustion is effected at the catalyst surface forming a gas 
stream at elevated temperature. There is a rapid rise in the 
temperature of the catalyst bed to about the adiabatic flame 
temperature, typically about 1200°C, when the catalyst lights-off. 
The point at which this occurs is associated with the pre-heat 
temperature and the catalyst activity. Before light-off occurs, 
the solid temperature rises exponentially along the bed length. 
When the catalyst lights-off, the whole of the catalyst may be at 
essentially the adiabatic flame temperature. The average 
temperature of the gas mixture increases more gradually through 
heat transfer from the solid to the gas phase. The gas 
temperature rises gradually even when the catalyst is lit-off, ie 
the catalyst front face is at the adiabatic flame temperature.  
 
When the temperature of the gas mixture reaches a value, typically 
about 900°C, at which homogeneous combustion commences, there is a 
rapid increase in the gas temperature to about the adiabatic flame 
temperature. Where, as is usual, the catalyst body is in the form 
of a monolith with through channels, eg a honeycomb configuration, 
a higher temperature may be required to achieve homogeneous, ie
