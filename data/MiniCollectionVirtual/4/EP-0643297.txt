<ABSTRACT>
An analytical system for analyzing, monitoring, diagnosing 
and/or controlling a process for manufacturing packaging glass 

products. The analytical system is provided with an infrared-sensitive 
sensor system and a digital processor connected 

therewith, which infrared-sensitive sensor system, directly 
after the glass-shaping process, detects infrared radiation 

emitted by heated products. By means of several infrared 
sensors the analytical system determines the energy 

distribution in the material of the product shaped, and by 
means of a mathematical reference model a statement is made on 

glass distribution and thermal stresses over and in the 
product shaped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an analytical system for analyzing,
monitoring, diagnosing and/or controlling a process for manufacturing
packaging glass products.The invention also relates to an apparatus for manufacturing, partly
by heating, packaging glass products provided with an analytical system in
which a glass material to be shaped into the packaging glass product is passed
along a production stage comprising a first section in which the glass material
is molten, a second section, following the first section, in which the product is
shaped from the glass material, and a third section, following the second
section, in which the glass material shaped into a product is cooled, the
infrared-sensitive sensor system detecting products at at least a point in the
second section in which the shaped products are not yet cooled.Such analytical systems are known from EP-0 177004.A problem in these processes is that the waste of products is
relatively high. This is partly caused by the fact that the products are
inspected after they have passed through the critical part of the production
process. In a glass blowing machine in which blown products traverse a stage
through an annealing furnace this means that the products are inspected by
means of a video camera when leaving the annealing furnace. In EP-177004
the glass product is illuminated with a light source for inspection by means of
a measuring unit comprising photodiodes.If at this point of the production process it is found that the quality
of the product is not sufficient and/or the product contains deviations, there is
a great chance that all the other products which have meanwhile been shaped
after the inspected product or products and, e.g., are still present in the
annealing furnace will have the same or a comparable problem and must be 
rejected accordingly. In other words, at the moment it is found in a productions
process that products do not meet a specific quality standard or show
deviations large amounts of other products with the same problems have
meanwhile been manufactured. When the production process is then
readjusted, optimized, yet a large amount of products will have to be rejected.Deviations which may occur in the product can be caused by, e.g.,
contamination of the material from which the product is made. This
contamination may already be present in the base material. before this is
shaped into a product. It is also possible, however, that the material is
contaminated during shaping of the product in the production process.The quality
