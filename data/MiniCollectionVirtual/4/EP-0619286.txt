<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided to remove oxygenates from a C₄ 
raffinate stream from an MTBE plant. A back-cracking 

catalyst is placed into the bottom of an oxygenate removal 
column which will convert any MTBE or TBA contained therein 

back to their original components of isobutene and methanol 
or water. The raffinate stream is first subjected to a 

water wash to remove the gross amounts of methanol and DME.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a process for 
the recovery of n-butenes from methyl tertiary butyl ether 
(MTBE) made by the reaction of methanol with isobutene 
contained within a mixed C₄ stream containing isobutene, 
normal butene and butanes. More particularly the invention 
relates to a catalytic distillation process which includes 
an oxygenate removal unit wherein light ends and light 
oxygenated compounds are separated from unreacted C₄'s 
utilizing a distillation column. Most particularly, the 
invention relates to the use of a catalyst in the lower end 
of the oxygenate recovery column to convert heavier 
oxygenated compounds, such as MTBE and tertiary butyl 
alcohol (TBA) back to their constituent components for ease 
of separation. The production of ethers by the reaction of an isoolefin 
and an alcohol is well known, e.g., US Pat. No.'s 
3,121,124; 3,270,081; 3,170,000; 3,629,478 and 3,634,534. 
One commercial operation utilizes the simultaneous reaction 
and distillation of the products from the reactants. This 
procedure has become known as catalytic distillation and 
has been adapted to MTBE production as disclosed in U.S. 
Patents 4,232,177; 4,307,254; 4,336,407; 4,504,687 and 
4,918,243. In the catalytic distillation process the 
catalyst is part of the distillation system acting as both 
catalyst and distillation structure. In addition to the 
above cited patents specific catalytic distillation 
structures are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patents 
4,215,011; 4,242,530; 4,302,356; 4,443,559 and 4,482,775. Briefly, a preferred and commercial catalyst structure 
described in the catalytic distillation process comprises a 
cloth belt with a plurality of pockets spaced along the 
belt and containing particulate catalyst material, said 
cloth belt being wound in a helix about a spacing material 
such as stainless steel knitted mesh. These units are then  
 
disposed in the distillation column reactor. In addition, 
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 4,443,559 and 4,250,052 
disclose a variety of catalyst structures for this use and 
are incorporated herein. Since the feed in MTBE production is generally a mixed C₄ 
stream, there is usually a C₄ stream, e.g. n-butenes 
separated and purified for other use. The separation of the reactants from the ether products 
is fairly efficient. However, the unreacted methanol and 
C₄'s which are taken overhead must then be separated. This 
presents somewhat of a problem because methanol forms 
various azeotropes in the C₄ stream
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for removing DME, MTBE, TBA, methanol or 
mixtures thereof from a C₄ hydrocarbon stream comprising: 


(a) feeding a substantially normal C₄ hydrocarbon feed 
stream containing minor amounts of DME, MTBE, TBA, methanol 

or mixtures thereof to a distillation column reactor; and 
(b) simultaneously in said distillation column reactor: 

(i) contacting said MTBE and TBA with a 
dissociation catalyst in the form of a catalytic 

distillation structure thereby decomposing at least a 
portion of the MTBE and TBA to form a decomposition product 

comprising isobutene, methanol and water, and 
(ii) fractionating the feed stream and 
decomposition product in said distillation column to 

provide a vaporous overhead fraction containing 
hydrocarbons and substantially all of the DME and methanol 

and a liquid bottoms fraction containing substantially less 
DME, MTBE, TBA and methanol than said feed stream. 
The process according to claim 1 wherein said vaporous 
overhead fraction comprises from about 20 to 40 volume 

percent of said feed stream and further comprising the 
steps of, 


(c) condensing the vaporous overhead fraction to form a 
liquid overhead fraction, and 
(d) returning a portion of the liquid overhead fraction 
to said distillation column. 
The process according to claim 2 wherein steps (a) 
through (d) are operated at a pressure in the range of 200 

to 300 psig. 
The process according to claim 2 or 3 wherein said liquid 
overhead fraction is cooled to a temperature in the range 

of 20°C to 50°C. 
The process according to anyone of claims 2 to 4 wherein said liquid 
overhead fraction of step (d) comprises substantially all 

of the hydrocarbons contained in the vaporous overhead 
fraction of step (b) (ii).
