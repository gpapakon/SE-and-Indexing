<ABSTRACT>
When light from a light source (108) is projected 
onto an eyeball (101), the position of illumination on 

eyeball (101) is changed by successively electrically 
choosing a plurality of light-emitting elements in 

light source (108) or by mechanically deflecting the 
light from the light source (108) by means of a movable 

mirror (503). The visual axis is detected by detecting 
the reflection light from eyeball (101) by a 

photoelectric conversion unit (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a visual axis
detecting method for detecting the observer's visual
axis, a visual axis detecting means, and an image
device having the visual axis detecting means, for
example, a camera such as a still camera or a video
camera, a display device such as a goggle type display,
etc.Many proposals have been made on the technology
to facilitate interfaces between various devices and a
man by detecting the direction of the visual axis of
man. Among them, the detection of visual axis is
relatively easy with apparatus as image devices
constructed in such a manner that a man looks into a
display screen.For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 1-241511 discloses an invention
concerning a camera provided with a visual axis
detecting apparatus, which is recently brought into
actual use. Fig. 13 shows a schematic diagram of the
visual axis detecting apparatus as described in the 
above application.In Fig. 12 reference numeral 1 designates an
objective lens, which is represented by a single lens
for convenience' sake but which is actually constructed
of a number of lenses, as well known. Numeral 2
denotes a main mirror, which is obliquely set in or is
withdrawn from a photo-taking optical path, depending
upon whether the camera is in an observing state or in
a photo-taking state. Numeral 3 denotes a submirror,
which reflects a beam of light having passed through
the main mirror 2 down toward the camera body not
shown. Further, 4a is a shutter, 4b a stop disposed in
the objective lens 1, and 4c a driving mechanism for
moving the objective lens 1 along the optical axis for
focusing.Numeral 5 represents a photosensitive member,
which is a silver-salt film, a solid state image
sensing device such as a CCD or MOS image sensor, or a
camera tube such as a vidicon.Further, 6a is a focus detecting unit.There is an eyepiece lens 9 disposed behind the
exit plane of a pentagonal roof prism 8 for changing
the finder optical path, which is used to observe a
focus plate 7 by the observer's eye 15. Numeral 10
represents an optical splitter, which is, for example,
a dichroic mirror for reflecting infrared light and
which is disposed in the eyepiece lens 9. Numeral 11 
denotes a condenser lens, 12 an optical splitter such
as a half mirror, and 13 an illumination light source
such as LED, which preferably emits infrared light (and
near infrared light). A beam of light emitted from the
infrared illumination light source 13 is changed into a
beam of parallel rays advancing along the finder
op
