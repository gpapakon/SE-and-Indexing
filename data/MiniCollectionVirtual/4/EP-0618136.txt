<ABSTRACT>
A form-fill-seal packaging machine, which pulls out an 
elongated film (4) from a roll (11) and transports it to a 

former (6) to form it in a tubular shape, includes a 
mechanism with two parallel rollers (21,22) such that the film path 

can be shifted transversely. The two rollers are formed as 
two sides of a linked parallelogram unit, of which the 

shape is automatically changeable according to the 
direction of the rollers so as to reduce the transverse 

distance by which the film (4) will have to slide on the 
rollers. A pair of such packaging machines, plane-symmetrically 

built with respect to each other, can be used 
advantageously in combination with a weigher having two 

discharge chutes because of the reduced separation between 
their formers (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging machines of the form-fill-seal 
type and, in particular, to such machines adapted 
for use in combination with a weigher having two discharge 
chutes. This invention also relates to a device for 
transversely shifting the path of a web of elongated film 
being transported longitudinally in such a packaging 
machine. Packaging machines of the so-called form-fill-seal type have 
been known as efficient means for providing packaged goods 
because they are able to form bags and to concurrently have 
them filled with articles to be packaged. As shown in Fig. 
1, a typical example of prior art packaging machine 1 of 
this type has a film roll 11 supported by a film-supporting 
shaft 3 extending transversely from left to right at the 
back of its frame 2. A web of belt-like elongated 
thermoplastic flexible packaging material (hereinafter 
referred to as "film") 4, from which bags are to be made, is 
pulled out of this film roll 11, passed through guide 
rollers 8 and 9 and a dancer roller 10, and brought forward 
to a former 6 at a front part of the machine 1 where the 
film is made into a tubular form with its side edges  
 
superposed one on top of the other. A vertical sealer 13 
seals these superposed side edges thermally to thereby form 
a film tube 5, and a horizontal sealer 14 seals the film 
tube 5 horizontally to make a bag. Weighing machines, such as combinational weighers, having 
two discharge paths have also been known, as disclosed, for 
example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,399,880, 4,467,880, 
4,544,042, 4,558,774, 4,570,727, and 4,676,326 assigned to 
the present assignee. Where articles to be packaged are 
weighed by a weigher of this type, two packaging machines 1 
must be placed next to each other as shown in Fig. 2 wherein 
numeral 15 indicates the weigher, numeral 16 indicates its 
collector chute and numerals 17 indicate its discharge 
chutes. Articles (of the same kind or of different kinds) 
discharged individually through these two discharge chutes 
17 are supplied to the pair of packaging machines 1 through 
hoppers 18, which are disposed above and coaxially with 
their formers 6 as shown in Fig. 1. When a pair of prior 
art packaging machines 1 is set next to each other as shown 
in Fig. 2, however, the distance P between their hoppers 18 
(that is, the distance between their formers 6) is typically 
about 800∼900mm. Since the distance p between the bottom 
openings of the collector chute 16 is generally about 
600∼650mm and hence is much smaller than

<CLAIMS>
A form-fill-seal packaging machine comprising 
supporting means for horizontally supporting a film roll 

(11) in a transverse direction; forming means (6) for 
forming a tubular shape out of a web of elongated flexible 

packaging material (film); transporting means for pulling 
a web of film (4) out of a film roll (11) supported by the 

supporting means and feeding the web to the forming means 
by guiding the web of film (4) from the film roll (11) to 

the forming means along a path; the forming means being at 
a transversely off-centre position closer to one of the 

sides of the machine and away from the vertical plane which 
is perpendicular to the transverse direction and in which 

lies the longitudinally extending centre line of a web of 
film as the web is pulled out of a film roll (11) supported 

by the supporting means; the transporting means including 
a path-shifting device disposed between the supporting 

means and the forming means for adjustably shifting the 
path in the transverse direction; the path-shifting device 

comprising a pair of rollers (21,22) which are parallel to 
each other and oblique to the transverse direction. 
A packaging machine according to claim 1, wherein the 
path-shifting device further comprises a pair of connecting 

members (23), the pairs of connecting members and rollers 
(21,22) being so rotatably connected to each other as to 

form a linked variably-shaped parallelogram unit; and 
rotating means for causing the connecting members to rotate 

with respect to the pair of rollers to thereby 
automatically change the shape of the linked parallelogram 

unit as the orientation of the rollers is changed with 
respect to the transverse direction. 
A packaging machine according to claim 1, wherein the 
off centre position is controlled according to the 

magnitude of angle . 
A packaging machine according to any of claims 1-3 
which is one of a pair disposed adjacent to each other, the 

pair of packaging machines being plane-symmetric with  
 

respect to the side surface thereof closer to their forming 
means.
