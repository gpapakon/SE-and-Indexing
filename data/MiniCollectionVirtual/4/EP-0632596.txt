<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a logic gate
circuit formed of semiconductor transistors, for
example of compound semiconductor transistors such as
MESFETs (Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors)
or HEMTs (High Electron Mobility Transistors).In a circuit arrangement comprising an integrated
circuit (e.g. of GaAs) having an output stage with a
large fan out (such as a clock circuit or a bus driving
circuit) and a logic gate circuit for providing an off-chip
buffer for driving an external circuit, a good
load drivability is desirable.Conventionally, a circuit as shown in FIG. 1 of
the accompanying drawings has been used for this type
of logic gate circuit.Referring to FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings,
the logic gate circuit has an inverter 1, a push-pull
circuit 5 and a clamping circuit 9. The inverter 1 is
formed as a logic gate stage and an input signal IN is
supplied to the inverter 1. The input signal IN may
have a high level (H-level) and a low level (L-level),
the H-level being, for example, 0.7 volts and the
L-level being, for example, 0 volts.The inverter 1 has an enhancement-type MESFET 2
used as a driver and a depletion-type MESFET 3 which is
used as a load. A power supply line 4 (VDD) is
connected to the inverter 1. The power supply line 4
supplies a voltage, for example, of 2 volts.The push-pull circuit 5 is formed as an output
driver state. The push-pull circuit 5 has a
depletion-type MESFET 6 used for the pull-up and an
enhancement-type MESFET 7 used for the pull-down. An
output signal OUT is output from an output node 8 at
which the depletion-type MESFET 6 and the enhancement-type
MESFET 7 are connected. The clamping circuit 9 clamps the gate voltage of
the depletion-type MESFET 6 at a constant voltage to
cause a level at the output node 8 to be stable at 0.7
volts when the output signal OUT has the H-level. The
clamping circuit 9 has a Schottky diode 10 and an
enhancement-type MESFET 11.In this logic gate circuit, when the input signal
IN has the H-level equal to 0.7 volts, the output
signal OUT has the L-level equal to 0 volts. On the
other hand, when the input signal IN has the L-level
equal to 0 volts, the output signal OUT has the H-level
equal to 0.7 volts.If the clamping circuit 9 is not provided in this
logic gate circuit, the level of the output signal OUT
exceeds 0.7 volts in response to the input signal IN
having the L-level equal to 0 volts. As a result, a
large amount of current flows from the power supply
line 4 (VDD) to the next stage circuit connected to
this
