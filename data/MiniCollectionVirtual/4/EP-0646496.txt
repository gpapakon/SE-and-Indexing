<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle carrier (10) includes first and second 
mounting members (18,20) and a pair of bicycle support arms (21), all 

interconnected by a pair of housings (30). The first mounting 
member (18) is rotatable to a selected position of adjustment 

and is locked in that position by means of a locking 
engagement with the bicycle support arms (21). The bicycle 

support arms (21) can be rotated to unlocking positions to 
enable the first mounting member (18) to be adjusted to a 

different position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bicycle carriers 
adapted to be mounted on the backs of vehicles. Bicycle carriers of that type are conventional, 
e.g., see U.S. Patent Nos. 3,710,999; 3,927,811; 
4,332,337; 4,428,516; 4,513,897; 4,830,250; and 5,211,323. 
It is common for a carrier to have first and second 
U-shaped mounting members which are seatable against 
upper and lower portions of the rear end of a vehicle, 
respectively. The carrier is attached to the vehicle by 
means of straps which are connected to the carrier and 
which carry hooks adapted to grasp portions of the 
vehicle. The mounting members are pivotable relative to 
one another, so that the angle formed between the mounting 
members can be adjusted to enable the carrier to fit 
different vehicle configurations. A pair of supporting 
arms project rearwardly for receiving a bicycle. The 
supporting arms include bent ends or adjustable brackets 
which form cradles on which a bar of the bicycle frame is 
laid. It is necessary to be able to fasten the mounting 
members in place after the necessary adjustment has been 
made, and to release the mounting members to enable them 
to be pivoted to other operating positions and possibly to 
a folded storage position.  It would be desirable to provide such a fastening 
mechanism for a bicycle carrier which securely holds the 
mounting members in place but which can be quickly and 
easily released. It would also be desirable to enable the bicycle 
carrier to be folded to a compact storage position. The present invention relates to a bicycle 
carrier which is adapted to be mounted on the rear of a 
vehicle. The carrier comprises first and second mounting 
members, each of which includes a pair of end portions. 
A bicycle supporting structure is provided which includes 
a pair of support arms for supporting at least one 
bicycle. Each of the support arms includes an end 
portion. A pair of pivot-forming units is provided, each 
including a housing which is connected to: an end portion 
of the first mounting member, an end portion of the second 
mounting member, and an end portion of one of the support 
arms. The end portions of the first mounting member are 
rotatably mounted to respective ones of the housings for 
rotation relative thereto about an axis of rotation so 
that the first mounting member can be placed in selected 
rotational positions. The second mounting member or the 
bicycle supporting structure defines a locking device for 
the first mounting member. That locking device is movable

A bicycle carrier adapted to be mounted on 
the rear of a vehicle, comprising: 

   first and second mounting members each including 
a pair of end portions; 

   bicycle supporting means including a pair of 
support arms for supporting at least one bicycle, 

each of said support arms including an end 
portion; 

   a pair of pivot forming means each including 
a housing connected to: 

   an end portion of said first mounting 
member, 

   an end portion of said second mounting 
member, and 

   an end portion of one of said support arms, 
said end portions of said first mounting 

member being rotatably mounted to 
respective ones of said housings for 

rotation relative thereto about an axis of 
rotation to selected rotational positions; 

   one of said second mounting member and said 
bicycle supporting means defining locking 

means for said first mounting member, said 
locking means being movable relative to 

 
said housings such that said end portions 

thereof move into locking engagement with 
said end portions of said first mounting 

member in a direction extending 
transversely of said axis of rotation for 

locking said first mounting member in a 
selected rotational position. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 1, 
wherein said bicycle supporting means defines said locking 

means. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 2, 
wherein said support arms are rotatable relative to 

said housings about respective axes of rotation oriented 
parallel to said axes of rotation of said end portions of 

said first mounting member. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 3, 
wherein each end portion of said first mounting member 

is coplanar with said end portion of a respective support 
arm. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 4, 
wherein said end portions of said first mounting member 

are defined by two fixedly interconnected legs, said end 
portions of said second mounting member being defined by 

two fixedly interconnected legs, said support arms being 
relatively movable. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 1, 
wherein said end portions of said locking means are 

rotatable relative to said housings about respective axes 
of rotation disposed parallel to said axes of rotation of 

said end portions of said first mounting member. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 1, 
wherein each end portion of said first mounting member 

is coplanar with said end portion of a respective support 

arm. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 1, 
wherein said first mounting member includes a pair of 

disks connected to respective said end portions of said 
first mounting member, each disk being connected to its 

respective housing for rotation about said axis of 
rotation, each said disk including a plurality of 

circumferentially spaced locking structures arranged 
for selective engagement by said locking means. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 7, 
wherein said locking structures of each disk comprise 

radially projecting teeth, said locking means including 
recesses for receiving said teeth. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 1, 
wherein at least one disk carries indicia corresponding to 

positions of adjustment of said first mounting member, and 
each housing includes a window through which one of said 

indicia is visible, said indicia corresponding to 
respective vehicle models so that each indicia indicates 

an adjustment position for a respective vehicle. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 1, 
wherein each of said pivot forming means includes 

releasable securing means for securing said locking means 
in locking engagement with said first mounting member. 
A bicycle carrier according to Claim 11, 
wherein said securing means comprises a manually 

displaceable latch mounted on said locking means and 
engageable with the other of said second mounting member 

and said bicycle supporting means.
