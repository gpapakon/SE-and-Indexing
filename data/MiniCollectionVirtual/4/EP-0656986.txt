<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an insert for use in 
slips, an adaptor provided with a plurality of such 
inserts and slips provided with one or more such adaptors. 
The invention also relates to an elevator provided 
with inserts in accordance with the invention. Slips are used to hold casing in position whilst 
additional lengths of casing are being added to the 
casing string. Applicants WO-A-91 18181 discloses an insert for 
use in slips, which insert comprises a resilient base 
member in which are embedded a plurality of pipe gripping 
members. The pipe gripping members disclosed are 
pins which significantly enhance the gripping properties 
of the insert whilst causing minimal damage to the 
surface of the pipe to be gripped. US-A-2 493 556 discloses an insert for use in 
slips, which insert comprises a plurality of strips 
which are embedded side by side in a resilient base 
member and each of which has a pipe gripping edge. The 
resilient base member projects beyond the strips so that 
when the insert is applied to casing the resilient base 
member is in continuous contact with the casing and 
forms a fluid tight seal therewith. US-A-2 830 788 discloses an apparatus for raising 
and lowering the deck of a drilling barge on caissons. 
During the raising and lowering operations the deck is 
supported temporarily by applying a plurality of segmented 
metal shoes to the outer surface of the caissons. 
The segmented metal shoes are mounted on the inner 
periphery of resilient rings which are disposed circumjacent 
the respective caissons. The segmented metal 
shoes are urged against the caissons by the application 
of fluid pressure to the resilient rings. Each segmented 
metal shoe covers a significant portion of the circumference 
of its respective caisson.  
 The present invention aims, at least in its preferred 
embodiments, to provide an insert which will 
adequately grip reasonably long casing strings with 
minimal damage to the casing. According to the present invention there is provided 
an insert for use in slips, which insert comprises a 
plurality of strips which are embedded side by side in a 
resilient base member and each of which has a pipe 
gripping edge, characterised in that said strips project 
beyond said resilient base member to form channels 
between adjacent strips to accommodate debris from the 
surface of the casing to be gripped. This arrangement allows space between the strips to 
accommodate paint and other debris derived from the 
surface of the casing. Preferably, said pipe

<CLAIMS>
An insert for use in slips, which insert (1) comprises 
a plurality of strips (3) which are embedded side 

by side in a resilient base member (2) and each of which 
has a pipe gripping edge (4), characterised in that said 

strips (3) project beyond said resilient base member (2) 
to form channels between adjacent strips (3) to accommodate 

debris from the surface of the casing to be gripped. 
An insert as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said pipe 
gripping edge (4) comprises teeth (4). 
An insert as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said teeth 
(4) have a leading face which is inclined at an angle 

(α) of from 60° to 120° to the longitudinal axis (X-X) 
of the strip (3). 
An insert as claimed in Claim 3, wherein α is 
substantially 90°. 
An insert as claimed in Claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein 
said teeth (4) have a trailing face which is inclined at 

an angle (β) of from 20° to 50° to the longitudinal axis 
(X-X) of the strip (3). 
An insert as claimed in Claim 5, wherein β is 
substantially 35°. 
An insert as claimed in any of Claims 2 to 6, 
wherein the depth (d) of said teeth (4) is from 0.2mm to 

2mm. 
An insert as claimed in Claim 7, wherein d is 
substantially 1mm. 
An insert as claimed in any of Claims 2 to 8, 
wherein said teeth are of differing hardness. 
An insert as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein 
said strips (3), in use, extend substantially parallel 

with the longitudinal axis of casing to be gripped. 
An insert as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein 
said pipe gripping surface is covered with a material  

 
which is corrosion-resistant. 
An insert as claimed in Claim 11, wherein said 
material comprises titanium. 
An adaptor provided with a plurality of inserts as 
claimed in any preceding Claim. 
An adaptor as claimed in Claim 13, wherein each 
insert has teeth of a specific hardness and the hardness 

of the teeth of one insert differs from the hardness of 
the teeth of another insert. 
Slips provided with one or more adaptors as claimed 
in Claim 13 or 14. 
An elevator incorporating an insert as claimed in 
any of Claims 1 to 12.
