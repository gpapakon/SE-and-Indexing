<ABSTRACT>
An ophthalmic protective filter lens having a scotopic 
transmittance lower than the photopic transmittance by more 

than a factor of two, a dominant wavelength within the 
ranges of 580-605 nm and a color purity of 75-85 whereby 

colors perceived through the lens are approximately those 
of the scene being viewed. 
A method of producing an ophthalmic protective filter 
lens which comprises firing a photochromic glass lens in a 

hydrogen-containing atmosphere within the temperature range 
of 400-430째C for a time of 1-8 hours to impart a scotopic 

transmittance lower than the photopic transmittance by a 
factor of at least two, a dominant wavelength within the 

ranges of 580-605 nm and a color purity of 75-85 whereby 
colors perceived through the lens are approximately those 

of the scene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field is ophthalmic filter lenses designed to 
protect the eye from the effects of strong sunlight. Certain diseases of the eye and/or visual deficiencies 
may be caused by, or may be aggravated by, strong sunlight, 
see U.S. Patent 4,284,686, especially at wavelengths of 
400-550 namometers (nm). As a corrective measure, the patent provides 
photochromic glasses that are treated to produce a colored 
surface layer, which exhibits near-zero transmittance of 
radiations having wavelengths shorter than a selected 
cutoff wavelength in the range 440-550 nm. The 
photochromic feature permits the same spectacles to be used 
both indoors and outside. To develop the colored layer, 
the photochromic glass is heated in a strongly reducing 
atmosphere, such as hydrogen at temperatures of 350-520째C 
for at least 12 hours. The basic U.S. Patent 3,208,860 describes silver 
halide photochromics. More recently, faster darkening 
and/or fading response is provided by U.S. Patent No. 
4,190,451. Photochromic glasses exhibiting a fixed color or tint 
in the undarkened state have also been commercially 
developed, some containing conventional glass colorants, 
others wherein coloration is imparted by treatment of the 
glass after manufacture with a coloring surface treatment,  
 
rather than by the inclusion of glass colorants in 
composition. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,892,582 and 3,920,463 for 
example, disclose thermal reduction treatments useful for 
imparting yellow surface colors to photochromic glasses, 
while U.S. Patent No. 4,240,836 describes a modified 
thermal reduction treatment which permits the development 
of a broader range of colors in this type of glass. Colored ophthalmic lenses, developed in accordance 
with the patent teachings, have provided relief for 
patients having light or glare sensitivity problems. Dye-impregnated 
plastic lenses have been developed as 
alternatives. The latter are sometimes referred to as 
"blockers", since they are stated to absorb all of the 
light below a certain wavelength. A major problem with the "blocker" lens is that total 
absorption of part of the spectrum greatly distorts color 
perception. This may also occur in the surface colored 
glass lens with an unduly long treating time. However, the 
time of the reducing treatment may be adjusted so that a 
carefully controlled small amount of blue transmission, 
referred to as a "blue leak", occurs. This provides a less 
severe distortion of color perception. It would be desirable to provide an improved 
ophthalmic filter

lens is produced using a tinted or untinted photochromic 

glass. 
A filter lens in accordance with claim 2 wherein the 
filter lens, in its faded state, has a photopic 

transmittance not over about 20% and the scotopic 
transmittance is 2.5-5%. 
A filter lens in accordance with claim 2 wherein the 
filter lens, in its faded state, has a photopic 

transmittance in the range of 25-50% and a scotopic 
transmittance in the range of 5-15%.

wherein the ratio of photopic to scotopic transmittance is 

at least 3:1. 
A filter lens in accordance with claim 1, 2, 3, 4, or 
5 wherein the spectral purity is about 80%, the dominant 

wavelength is about 585-595 nm, and the lens provides 
minimal color distortion. 
A filter lens in accordance with any one of claims 1-5 
wherein the filter lens is a photochromic glass having 

permanent induced color on both front and back surfaces, or 
on only the back surface. 
A method of producing an ophthalmic protective filter 
lens which comprises firing a silver halide-containing 

photochromic glass lens in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere 
within the temperature range of 400-430째C for a time of 1-8 

hours to impart a scotopic transmittance lower than the 
photopic transmittance by a factor of at least two, a 

dominant wavelength within the ranges of 580-605 nm and a
