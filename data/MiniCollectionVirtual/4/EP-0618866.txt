(1', 1'') on which at least one information support (5) 

is provided, with an opening (3) in the card surfaces, 
into which opening the information support is fitted, 

wherein the said information support (5) is a laterally 
inverted negative which is readable without technical 

aids and which contains non-encoded emergency data.

the opening (3) in a card surface (1', 1'') is 

equivalent to about 10 to 90% of the card surface. 
A card according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the opening (3) in the card surface (1', 1'') is 

equivalent to about 30 to 50% of the card surface. 
A card according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the format of the card (1) is 

about 80 to 90 mm in length, about 50 to 60 mm in width 
and about 0.5 to 1.2 mm in thickness.
