<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a biospecific multiparameter 
assay method using microparticles distributed in different 

categories and representing different analytes, in which 
method the microparticles belonging to different categories 

are labelled with a fluorescent molecule (1) and in which 
method the microparticles belonging to different categories 

are coated with bioaffinity reactants A binding different 
analytes. This invention is characterized by labelling the 

microparticles and the bioaffinity reactants B, labelled 
with a fluorescent molecule (2), with different molecules 

emitting long-lived fluorescence (1, 2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a biospecific assay method which
allows the simultaneous determination of a plurality of
analytes in the same sample.Microparticles can be employed as a solid phase carrier in
various bioaffinity assays. In such assays it is often
useful or necessary to perform a plurality of simultaneous
assay reactions, thus eliminating repetition of parallel
assay steps. One possibility to perform multiparameter
analysis is offered by the use of microparticles as a solid
phase carrier (Soini E., US 5,028,545). In such a system
specific probes are linked to said particles, whereafter
particles embodying different specificities may be mixed.
The mixture can thus be used as a solid phase carrier in
bioaffinity assays. When taking measurements after the
completion of the reaction it is essential to be able to
identify as many particle categories with different
specificities as possible. For the purpose of
identification such properties as the size of the particles
(McHugh, T.M. et al., J. Immunol. Methods 1986; 95: 57 -
61) may be utilized, or coloured particles (Streefkerk
J.G., Kors, N., Boden, D. Protides Biol. Fluids 1976; 24:
811 - 814) or particles labelled with various fluorescent
molecules (Dean, K.J. et al. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 1051 -
1056) may be employed.In bioaffinity reactions two biological molecules are
capable of binding with great accuracy even in the presence 
of other molecules. Such molecules capable of binding to
each other are e.g. antibodies and their corresponding
antigens, single-stranded DNA molecules and their
corresponding nucleic acid sequences, and receptors and the
molecules that specifically bind to them. All these
reactions may be given the common denomination of
bioaffinity reactions.Bioaffinity reactions are exploited in various practical
applications and in assays in research. A known
biomolecule, which may be purified from biological material
(e.g. an antibody) or synthesized chemically (e.g. an
oligonucleotide DNA) can be labelled in such a manner as to
allow detection after the completion of the bioaffinity
reaction. At present the major applications of bioaffinity
reactions include immunoassays and nucleic acid
hybridization assays, which are used to assay various
components from e.g. blood. Assays based on receptors as
biological reactants are important in the search for new
medicinal substances.Assays performed on blood or its components may be divided
in groups relevant to certain diseases or medical
operations. In multiparameter assays the analytes
