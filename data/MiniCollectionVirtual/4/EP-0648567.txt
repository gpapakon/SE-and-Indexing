<ABSTRACT>
Saw wires, in particular when they revolve around rollers, on the one hand have the problem that the cutting grains abrade and break away during sawing and on the other hand they are exposed to high alternating bending load and fracture. The invention divides the saw wire, as shown in Fig. 1, into a non-metallic supporting core (1), a metallic backing layer (2), and the coating (3) with cutting bodies (4). Consequently, a fracture-resistant supporting core unaffected by the coating and a coating optimized for the best possible bonding of the cutting bodies are obtained. The result is long tool life.
