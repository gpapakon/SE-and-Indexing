<ABSTRACT>
The invention is an improvement in an optical fiber alignment apparatus of the type having a pair of optically-opposed fibers (17, 19), means (25) associated with one of the fibers (17 or 19) for generating an alignment signal, means (31) associated with the other fiber (19 or 17) for alignment-sensitive detection of the alignment-signal, and means (33) responsive to such detection to adjust relative positions of the fibers (17, 19). In the improvement, the means (25) for generating the alignment signal comprises an array (27) of radiation-emitting devices (REDs) (29). Radiation from the REDs (29) in an array (27) associated with a particular fiber (17 or 19) is received in a radiation guide (45, 45a) of the other fiber (19 or 17) and individually measured. The position of the other fiber (19 or 17) is adjusted until radiation received from each RED (29) is substantially equal to that received from each other RED (29) in the array (27). In one arrangement, the radiation guide (45, 45a) is part of the signal-carrying fiber (17 or 19). In another arrangement, the radiation guide (45, 45a) is part of a separate aligning fiber (53) mounted adjacent to and movable with the signal-carrying fiber (17 or 19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical fiber
switching and, more particularly, to an improved apparatus
and method for aligning optical fibers to effect signal
transmission therebetween.The advent of high-quality optical fibers spurred
development and installation of communication systems using
such fibers to carry light-beam signals between remote
points. Such "signals" include binary-encoded data, human
speech and TV signals encoded for transmission by light
beams. Telephone systems commonly employ optical fibers.A requirement of such communications systems is that
any one of a group of optical fibers can be connected to
any one of another group of such fibers. Fiber optic
switches perform such a function.In fact, such switches do not physically connect such
fibers. Rather, the fibers (or, more accurately, the
signal-carrying cores exposed at the fiber ends) are
brought to a "signal-transferring" relationship to one
other so that a light beam carried by one fiber is "picked
up" by the other.Two factors are of particular importance in a fiber
optic switch. One is that alignment of fibers must be
performed very rapidly. And this is so irrespective of
whether only two or a relatively large number of fibers is
involved. Users have little tolerance for delay occasioned 
by a switch which is slow to react. Another is that
alignment must be performed very accurately since signal
attenuation (or avoidance of it) is very much a function of
alignment accuracy.One known approach to fiber alignment involves the use
of four photodiodes arranged contiguously one to another in
a "2x2" arrangement. Such diodes produce an electrical
output generally proportional to the amount of light
striking the diode. The arrangement uses two or three
fibers in side-by-side relationship. One fiber (the center
one in a three-fiber configuration) carries the voice or
data signal and one or two emit light for alignment. An
aligning beam (or beams) of light impinges on the diodes
and when the output signal from each diode is generally
equal to that of each other diode, the associated signal-carrying
fiber is properly aligned.A disadvantage of this approach is that it seriously
affects lens placement and, as a consequence, has an
adverse effect on the overall size of the switch.Other approaches involving fiber alignment (but not in
a fiber optic switch) are shown in various United States
patents, one of which is U.S. Patent No. 4,677,290 (Mitch).
The Mitch patent describes a method for aligning an optical
fiber with a single
