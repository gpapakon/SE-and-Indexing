<ABSTRACT>
An interactive electronic thermostat (100) incorporates a safety backup system (130) to automatically activate the HVAC system (23, 24, 25) in the event that normal operation of the thermostat (100) is interrupted and the temperature in the conditioned area falls or rises beyond a predetermined range. The thermostat (100) operates to communicate with an installer through an audible or visual display (106) and keypad (104) to instruct the installer to perform tasks and enter observations to effect proper connections at the thermostat (100) of HVAC system (23, 24, 25) wires even in the absence of labels indentifying the functions of those wires. The thermostat (100) requires entry of coded indicia representing operator-observed conditions in the system in response to displayed instructions carried out by the operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic 
thermostats for heating/cooling systems and, more 
particularly, to thermostats employing a user-interactive 
microprocessor controlled by unique software to 
facilitate installation and user interaction. WO-A-90/0647 discloses the features of the 
preambles of claims 1 and 7. There are numerous electronic thermostats known in 
the prior art, some of which are disclosed in U. S. 
Patents Nos. 4,172,555 (Levine '555); 4,199,023 
(Phillips); 4,206,872 (Levine '872); 4,356,962 (Levine 
'962); 4,408,711 (Levine '711); 4,460,123 (Beverly); 
4,469,274 (Levine '274); and 4,473,183 (Kensinger et 
al). Some of these electronic thermostats include 
microprocessors controlled by specifically formulated 
software designed to effect intended heating/cooling 
system operation. Specifically, the aforementioned 
Beverly patent discloses a thermostat utilizing a 
microprocessor. All prior art electronic thermostats  
 
have been difficult for the average homeowner to install, particularly when replacing 
a thermostat in a pre-existing HVAC system. In particular, the wires of an existing 
system are not labelled as to function, (i.e. burner, fan, air conditioner, voltage 
supply, etc.) and it is quite likely that the wires can be improperly connected, 
possibly causing damage to system equipment. Consequently, the installation of 
prior art electronic thermostats has required trained personnel to avoid damage to 
the system. In addition, when a thermostat is replaced in a pre-existing HVAC system, 
it is possible that the new thermostat will be incompatible with the pre-existing 
system. For example, in the case of a HVAC system described in our 
aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,725,001, the system utilizes a unique cycling 
arrangement of on-time and pause intervals. That particular cycling arrangement 
may not be compatible with heat pumps or with certain types of boiler heating units, 
namely: (1) steam radiator heating systems; or (2) any boiler in which the fluid is 
heated by an immersion type heater such that the fluid temperature and fluid 
circulation are separately controlled. Under such circumstances the 
homeowner/operator must be made aware of the incompatibility and must be 
instructed to either have the system modified or to return the thermostat to the place 
of purchase. U.S. Patent No. 4,431,134 discloses a thermostat arrangement with a safety 
feature for addressing problems associated with the interruption of power to the 
thermostat. The safety device
