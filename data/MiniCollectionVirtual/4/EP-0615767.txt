<ABSTRACT>
A catheter introducer set (2) is disclosed. The device 
comprises a cannula (10) for insertion into a blood vessel, a 

tube (6) in fluid communication with the cannula and a needle 
for assisting in the introduction of the cannula into the 

vessel. Between the cannula (10) and the tube (6) is an 
intermediate member (8) which allows the needle to be gripped 

so that it can be inserted into the blood vessel. The 
intermediate member preferably has a pair of wings (14, 14') 

to facilitate the gripping of the needle. The needle has an 
opening or openings in it to allow a user to observe blood 

flashback during insertion of the needle into the blood 
vessel. The intermediate member (8) is made of polyurethane 

and is provided with a groove (13) to facilitate the gripping 
of the needle. The wings have ramps (52, 52') on them to 

facilitate the gripping of the needle. Ribs (53, 53') are 
also provided between the ramp and the intermediate member to 

facilitate gripping. The wings (14, 14') describe an angle of 
less than 180 degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of medical catheters. In
particular it relates to a catheter for providing access to a blood vessel and the
like and having features which facilitate its introduction into the vessel.Winged infusion sets are commonly used by the medical profession for the
infusion of medication and the drawing of fluids from vessels. A species of such
devices (a "scalp vein set") may comprise a needle with wings attached to it.
Attached to the needle, and in fluid communication with the needle bore is a
translucent tube through which medication can be infused or fluids drawn.
Another species (a winged catheter introducer), comprises a flexible cannula
attached to a winged member and a translucent tube. Inside the cannula is a
needle with a wire attached to it. The needle aids in the insertion of the catheter
into a vessel and is withdrawn by pulling the wire once the cannula has been
successfully introduced into the vessel.Such devices are introduced into the vessel as follows: The wings are
gripped between the practitioner's forefinger and thumb. The practitioner uses
the needle to pierce the skin in the vicinity of the vessel to be accessed. When
the vessel is penetrated, the pressure in the vessel will cause blood to flow up the
needle bore and into the translucent tubing. The practitioner verifies the
penetration of the vessel by looking for blood "flashback" in the tubing. Once
the device is satisfactorily positioned in the vessel it may be left there for some
time. In the case of a winged catheter introducer, the needle is withdrawn from
the cannula.A device of the second species is shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,177,809
and 5,163,913 this latter document being the one after which the preamble of Claim 1 was
patterned. Such devices are 
sold under the trademarks Intima™ and Angioset® by Becton Dickinson & Co.
of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.The invention is a catheter introducer set by means of which the catheter is
introduced into a blood vessel or the like by means of an introducer needle as
described in the Background section above. The introducer set of the invention
having the further features set forth in the characterizing portion of Claim 1, has enhanced
needle gripping features.The preferred embodiment of the invention may be summarized as
follows: The catheter introducer set comprises a tube having a first lumen. A
cannula having a first end for introducing into a blood vessel and a second end is
provided. The cannula comprises a second lumen between the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A catheter introducer set (2) comprising:

a tube (6) having a first internal lumen (6b),
a cannula (10) having a first end for introducing into a blood vessel and a
second end, the cannula having a second internal lumen (10b) between the first and

second ends;
an intermediate member (8) linking the cannula (10) and the tube (6), the intermediate

member being radially elastically deformable;
a needle (16) comprising a sharp tip (34), the needle being disposable lengthwise in
the first (6b) and second (10b) lumens such that at least part of the needle lies within the

intermediate member (8);
gripping means (14, 14') for squeezing the intermediate member (8) such that the part
of the needle (16) lying within the intermediate member (8) can be gripped by the

intermediate member;
wherein the gripping means

comprises a pair of wings (14, 14') attached to the intermediate member (8), wherein each
wing, (14, 14') is substantially on an opposite side of the intermediate member to the other

wing, and wherein the wings (14, 14') are adapted to squeeze the intermediate member (8) by
bringing the wings towards each other, and the wings (14, 14') comprise

surfaces having generally wedge-shaped members (52, 52') thereon

   characterised in that: 

the intermediate member (8) is provided with an elongate indentation (13)
substantially parallel to the lumen (10b) of the cannula (10) to facilitate gripping of the

needle by the intermediate member; and
the generally wedge-shaped
members comprise the means for squeezing the intermediate member, 

(53, 53') wherein the means for
squeezing comprise ribs projecting from the generally wedge-shaped members (52, 52')

towards the elongate indentation (13) to transmit
any forces applied to the generally wedge-shaped members to the elongate indentation (13).
The catheter introducer set of claim 1 wherein the intermediate
member (8) is made of polyurethane.
The catheter introducer set of claim 2 wherein the polyurethane has
a durometer hardness in a range of about 60 to 95 Shore A.
The catheter introducer set of claim 2 wherein the polyurethane has
a durometer hardness of about 80 Shore A.
The catheter introducer set of claim 1 or 2, wherein said tube (6)
is made of polyvinyl chloride.
The catheter introducer set of claim 5 wherein the polyvinyl
chloride has a durometer hardness in a range of about 60 to 80 Shore A

and is substantially translucent.
The catheter introducer set of claim 6 wherein the polyvinyl
chloride has a durometer hardness of about 70 Shore A
