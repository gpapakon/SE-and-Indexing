<ABSTRACT>
The base stations (BS) in a multi-cellular cordless telephone system are connected to a communications system (KS) - particularly a telecommunications branch exchange, via connecting lines (VL). The base stations (BS) are arranged at a distance from one another in such a manner that synchronisation information (si) wirelessly sent out by a base station (BS) can be received at least partially in an adjacent base station (BS). Both the initial wireless synchronisation and the synchronisation during the operation is controlled by the communications system (KS) in such a manner that in each case one base station (PS) is synchronised to the synchronising information (si) sent out by an adjacent base station (BS). Compared with a synchronisation of the base stations (BS) via connecting lines (VL), phase deviations caused by delay times and different processing speeds in the circuits of the synchronising devices are avoided in the wireless synchronisation and, in addition, synchronisation of base stations (BS) covering the communications system is possible.

Method for synchronizing base stations (BS) in
a multicellular cordless telephone system in which the

base stations (BS) are connected to a communication
system (KS) via link lines (VL), characterized


in that synchronizing information (si) is sent out
cordlessly by the base stations (BS),
in that the base stations (BS) are arranged at a
distance from one another in such a manner that

synchronizing information (si) received cordlessly
can be received at least partially at least by an

adjacent base station (BS),
and in that the initial cordless synchronization
of all base stations BS in the multicellular

cordless telephone system and the cordless
synchronization during the operation is controlled

by the communication system (KS) via the link
lines (VL), in each case one base station (BS)

being synchronized to the synchronizing
information (si) sent out and received by an

adjacent base station (BS).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the receivability of the synchronizing information

(si) received cordlessly is determined by a level
measurement.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that during the level measurement, the level of the

synchronizing information (si) received cordlessly is 
compared with a predetermined synchronizing level and a

receivability information item (ri) is formed if the
level of the synchronizing information (si) receiv
ed
cordlessly exceeds the synchronizing level.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, during an initial

synchronization controlled by the communication system
(KS),


all base stations (BS) are controlled to a
receiving state,
a synchronizing information (si) stored in one of
the base stations (BS) is cordlessly sent out due

to a starting information (sti) conveyed by the
communication system (KS),
after reception of the synchronizing information
(si), sent out cordlessly, with adequate level in

one of the adjacent base stations (BS), a
receivability information item (ri) is formed in

the latter and conveyed to the communication
system via link lines (VL),
after reception of a receivability information
item (ri) in the communication system (KS),

conveying of a control information item (si) via
the link lines (VL) causes the relevant base

station (BS) to synchronize to the synchronizing
information (si) received cordlessly and to send

out a synchronizing information item (si) stored
in this base station,
and, after reception of receivability information
items (ri) from other base stations (BS) and

synchronization to the synchronizing information
items (si) received cordlessly in each case, the

cordless sending out of synchronizing information
(si) is repeated until all base stations (BS) are

synchronized to the respective adjacent base
station (BS).
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that during reception of at least two receivability 

information items (ri) from at least two base stations
(BS) in the communication system (KS), the relevant

base stations (BS) are interrogated with respect to the
amplitude of the received level of the synchronizing

information (si) conveyed cordlessly, in each case with
the aid of level measurement information (pmi) and

level result information (pei) conveyed via link lines
(VL), and that the base station (BS) which has reported

the highest received level of the synchronizing
information (si) received cordlessly is caused by the

communication system (KS) to synchronize to the
synchronizing information (si) received cordlessly, by

the conveying of a control information item (sin) via
the link lines (VL).
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that during reception of the synchronizing information

(si), sent out cordlessly, with adequate level in at
least one of the adjacent base stations (BS), the

received level is measured in these and a receivability
information item and a level result information item

(pei, ri) are formed and together are conveyed
terrestrially to the communication system (KS), and

that the base station (BS) which has reported the
highest received level of the synchronizing information

(si) received cordlessly is caused by the communication
system (KS) to synchronize to the synchronizing

information (si) received cordlessly, by the
terrestrial conveying of a control information item

(si).
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that resynchronization of the

base station (BS) is carried out during the operation
in the order established during the initial

synchronization, taking into consideration the existing
master-slave relations of the adjacent base stations

(BS). 
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in
that resynchronization of the base station can be

carried out temporarily, regularly or continuously.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the cordless

synchronization of base stations (BS) can be carried
out across the communication system.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the information to be

conveyed cordlessly is formed in accordance with the
DECT standard.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a transmission unit and

line interface units in the base station (BS) are
implemented by means of message switching units which

can be coupled to a number of subordinate units
representing individual transmission channels via in

each case one link line (VL) and which exhibit a
receiving unit which evaluates signals supplied to it

and conditions them for further processing, and
comprising a switching unit preceding the receiving

unit and coupled to the link line (VL), which switches
through one of the link lines (VL) in dependence on a

control signal, and comprising a monitoring unit
coupled to the link lines (VL) which detects the

occurrence of transmit signals of the subordinate units
on the respective link line (VL) and outputs

corresponding control signals, and comprising a
selection unit coupled to the monitoring unit, the

switching unit and the link line (VL) which selects one
of the link lines in accordance with predetermined

criteria in dependence on the control signals of the
monitoring unit and generates corresponding adjustment

signals for the switching unit and the subordinate
units.
