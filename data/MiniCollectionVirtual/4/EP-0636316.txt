<ABSTRACT>
A device for producing pretzel shapes (40) is essentially composed of       - a feeding and advancing unit (1) for the strand (2) of dough, - a mount (17), which adjoins this unit (1) and can be moved on a circular track, for the start of the strand (2) of dough, - a winding core (21), which can be rotated coaxially with said circular track and is arranged alongside the latter, for the pretzel bow (32), and a hook (22) which grips the strand (2) of dough at the pretzel knot (34), - displacement devices (10-12;26) for setting various relative positions between the advancing point of the strand (2) of dough, the mount (17) for the start of the strand (2) of dough and the winding core (21),   - in an initial relative position the advancing point of the strand (2) of dough being at least to some extent at the same level as the circular track of the mount (17), - in a second relative position, the advancing point being situated alongside this plane in the cross-sectional plane of the winding core (21) and - in a third relative position, the advancing point being situated in a plane between the two aforementioned planes,   - units (36) for pressing the ends of the two pretzel webs (31; 33) against the pretzel bow (32).

An apparatus for producing pretzel shapes (40)
 
characterised by 


a feed and advance device (1) for the dough strand (2), followed by 
a holder (17) movable on a circular path, for the beginning of the dough 
stand (2), 
a reel hub (21) for the pretzel arc (32), rotatable coaxially to this circular 
path and mounted adjacent to the same, and a hook (22) catching the 

dough strand (2) at the pretzel knot (34), 
displacement devices (10-14; 26) for setting various relative positions 
among the place of advancement (28; 29) of the dough strand (2), the 

holder (17) for the beginning of the dough strand (2), and the reel hub 
(20), wherein 


in a first relative position (Fig. 3) the place of advancement (28) of the 
dough strand (2) at least at the start is in the same plane as the 

circular path of the holder (17), 
in a second relative poisition (Fig. 4) the place of advancement (29) 
lies adjacent this plane in the cross-sectional plane of the reel hub 

(21), and 
in a third relative position (Figs. 1, 5) the place of advancement (29) 
lies in a plane between the two aforementioned planes, 
devices (36) for pressing the ends of the two pretzel crosspieces (31; 33) 
to the pretzel arc (32), 
and a control means for the associated rotary (23; 24) and displacement 
drives (1, 7, 10, 11, 26) such that 


in the first relative position (Fig. 3) the beginning of the dough strand 
(2) is inserted into the holder (17), or this relative position is assumed 

after the insertion has taken place,  
 
during a first rotational segment of the holder (17), before the dough 
strand (2) is applied to the reel hub (21), the second relative position 

(Fig. 4) is brought about, 
after the dough strand (2) is looped around the reel hub (21) and is 
again laid over the hook (22), the third relative position (Fig. 1, 5) is 

brought about with a short movement, and 
when the designated final position of the second pretzel crosspiece 
(33) is reached its end is pressed onto the pretzel arc (32). 
The apparatus according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the end of the first pretzel crosspiece (31) is pressed down simultaneously 

with the end of the second pretzel crosspiece (32). 
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the feed and advance device (1) comprises a conveyor belt (3) and a 

grasping device (4) mounted at its end and preferably movable by 
pivoting (7, 8) preferably downward around the conveyor belt end and 

toward the holder (17). 
The apparatus according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that the holder (17) comprises an eye (17) or fork or notch 

or grasper or suction means, preferably attached to a disc (18) parallel to 
the reel hub. 
The apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the reel hub (21) is designed as a flat projection on a disc (19), preferably in 

the form of a plurality of single elements (20) protruding on the disc (19). 
The apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the hook (22) is bent toward the outside of the pretzel shape (40).  

 
The apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the displacement devices (10-14; 26) for setting the different relative 

positions at least partly comprise axial displacement devices (26) of the 
holder (17) and/or of the reel hub (21). 
The apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that
 
the feed and advancement device (1), particularly the grasping device (4) 

according to claim 3, is designed as a displacement device (10-14) for 
setting different relative positions. 
The apparatus according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that
 
the advancement position (29) existing in the second relative position (Fig. 

4) is the normal position, and that to bring about the first relative position 
(Fig. 3) the grasping device (4) briefly pulls only the beginning of the dough 

strand (2) to one side, away from the normal advancement position (29). 
The apparatus according to any of claims 7 to 9,
 
characterised in that
 
to bring about the third relative position (Figs. 1, 5) the reel hub (21) is axially 

displaceable to a greater distance from the holder (17, 18) while 
maintaining the normal advancement position (29), 
The apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 10,
