means (17,18,19,20) coupled to the navigation means (13), 
to the terminal (1,2,3) and to the operating system (16)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an architecture of 
electronic data processing system for modeling, linking, 
editing, and retrieving active and processable hypermedial 
annotations of a processable and active type and the 
related method for annotations generation and processing. It further relates to the definition of a specific 
achitecture solving the implementation technicals problems 
of an annotation service in a local network of distributed 
and heterogeneous computers. By the wording "electronic hypermedia annotations" are 
meant annotations (in the following also briefly designated 
as notes) stored and processed in digital form in 
computers, composed of differing media (text, diagrams, 
images and animations visualized on a screen and sound or 
voice reproducible by means connected to computerised 
workstations) which may be related to documents selected 
portions. By processable and active annotations, annotations are 
meant which, in addition of being displayable, are 
susceptible of different kinds of treatment, specific of 
data processing systems, such as selection, ordering, 
classifying, retrieval and which, by their nature are 
capable of activating processes and of interacting with the 
electronic system where they reside and with the system 
users. In this sense they may also be defined as smart. In the state of art many examples of solution to the 
problem of supporting the annotation process, both on 
physical objects and on their electronic form, can be 
found. The printed document can be easily annotated by 
writing or sketching thereon but this operation is 
constrained by the space available and allowed for writing. The notes of this kind can not be moved and are  
 
accessible only by retrieving the annotated sheets. This limitation gave rise to catch-eyes and removable 
sticky notes, known with the trademark "Post-it" of the 3M 
company. They can be attached to any physical objects that is 
compatible with the note's glued surface. The diffusion of computerized equipment for a more 
efficient, collaborative and user-location-independent 
processing of multimedia documents has extended the problem 
of supporting annotation to the electronic documents and 
annotation distribution. Some editing programs or "editors" support flat 
written annotations and a few typographic cues such as 
margin and foot notes. The Compound Document Model implemented by Microsoft 
in Windows environment, allows to add, by means of the 
protocol known as OLE (Object Linking and Embedding),

Electronic system architecture for annotating 
documents and objects with processable and active 

notes comprising: 

a data processing system (4,5,6,7,8,9) having at 
least a user terminal (1,2,3), for information storing 

retrieving and processing; 
management tools (16) of said information according 
to a plurality of structural models, 
hypermedia object management and navigation means
