<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
microwave thermal therapy of tissue In particular, the
present invention relates to an efficient microwave
antenna design for transurethral microwave thermal
therapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).The prostate gland is a complex, chestnut-shaped
organ which encircles the urethra immediately
below the bladder. Nearly one third of the prostate
tissue anterior to the urethra consists of fibromuscular
tissue that is anatomically and functionally related to
the urethra and bladder. The remaining two thirds of
the prostate is generally posterior to the urethra and
is comprised of glandular tissue.This relatively small organ, which is the most
frequently diseased of all internal organs, is the site
of a common affliction among older men: BPH (benign
prostatic hyperplasia). BPH is a nonmalignant,
bilateral nodular expansion of prostrate tissue in the
transition zone, a periurethral region of the prostate
between the fibromuscular tissue and the glandular
tissue. The degree of modular expansion within the
transition zone tends to be greatest anterior and
lateral to the prostatic urethra relative to the
posterior-most region of the urethra. Left untreated,
BPH causes obstruction of the urethra which usually
results in increased urinary frequency, urgency,
incontinence, nocturia and slow or interrupted urinary
stream. BPH may also result in more severe
complications, such as urinary tract infection, acute
urinary retention, hydronephrosis and uraemia.Traditionally the most frequent treatment for
BPH has been surgery (transurethral resection). 
Surgery, however, is often not an available method of
treatment for a variety of reasons. First, due to the
advanced age of many patients with BPH, other health
problems, such as cardiovascular disease, can warrant
against surgical intervention. Second, potential
complications associated with transurethral surgery,
such as hemorrhage, anesthetic complications, urinary
infection, dysuria, incontinence and retrograde
ejaculation, can adversely affect a patient's
willingness to undergo such a procedure.A fairly recent alternative treatment method
for BPH involves microwave thermal therapy, in which
microwave energy is employed to elevate the temperature
of tissue surrounding the prostatic urethra above about
45Â°C, thereby thermally damaging the tumorous tissue, as
well as adjacent healthy tissue. Delivery of microwave
energy to tumorous prostatic tissue is generally
accomplished by a microwave antenna-containing
applicator,

<CLAIMS>
A device for interstitial thermal therapy, the device
comprising: a catheter (28), and


a coaxial cable (76) carried by the catheter (28) with antenna
(74) connected to the coaxial cable (76), further 
characterized

in that:
the antenna is a helical dipole antenna (74) for producing an
essentially cylindrically symmetrical radiation pattern; and an

impedance matching means (128) is between the antenna and coaxial
cable for matching impedances of the coaxial cable and the antenna.
The device of claim 1, further 
characterized
 in that
the antenna (74) is a helically wound flat wire (140).
The device of claim 1 or 2, further 
characterized
 in
that the antenna (74) has an effective electrical length which

is greater than a physical length of the antenna (74).
The device of claims 1-3, further 
characterized
 in
that the effective electrical length of the antenna (74) is

approximately equal to one-half of a wavelength of the microwave
energy.
The device of claims 1-4, further 
characterized
 in
that the impedance matching means (128)

has a reactive impedance which cancels
a reactive component of the impedance of the antenna (74)

so that less than about 1% of power delivered by the coaxial
cable (76) to the antenna (74) is reflected.
The device of claims 1-5, further 
characterized
 in
that the coaxial cable (76) includes an outer insulator (126), 

an outer conductor (124), an inner insulator (122), and an inner
conductor (120).
The device of claims 1-6, further 
characterized
 in
that the antenna (74) includes a first antenna section (142) and

a second antenna section (144) which are connected together at
an intermediate point to the first and second antenna sections

(142, 144), the intermediate point being electrically connected
to the outer conductor (124) and the coaxial cable (76).
The device of claim 7, further 
characterized
 in that
the first and second antenna sections (142, 144) have

equal effective electrical
lengths.
The device of claims 1-8, further 
characterized
 in
that the impedance matching means (128) includes a reactive

element connected between the inner conductor (120) of the coaxial
cable (76) and a second connection point, the reactive element

having a reactive impedance which cancels a reactive component
of the impedance of the antenna (74).
