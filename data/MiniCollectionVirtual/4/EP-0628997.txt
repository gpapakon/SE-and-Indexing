<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device, in particular, a
package structure in which a semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) chip is
sealed in resin, the manufacturing method of making same, and a lead
frame.Conventionally, what is shown in Figures 19-20 is known as the
mounting structure for IC chips, and lead frame material 1 shown in Figure
21 is used in the mounting.The lead frame material 1 is formed entirely of metal (e.g., 42 alloy,
copper alloy, copper, etc.), and lead frame outer frame 2 and lead frame part
8 having a plurality of inner leads 7 extending radially in four directions in
the inside position are formed as one body by etching, etc.Namely, in lead frame part 8, outer leads 6 are connected by linear
connection parts (dumb bar) 9 at each side and the connection parts are
integrated to outer frame 2 with each corner part of lead frame part 8.IC chip 10 is mounted on a square shaped mounting pad (die pad) 11
having a larger area than the area of IC chip 10. Support pins 12 which
support the mounting pad 11 are provided on the mounting pad 11 and are
integrated with outer frame 2 at the corner parts. 4 in the figure is the hole
for positioning the lead frame material.Semiconductor package 13, which is fixed, wire bonded, and resin-sealed
as shown in Figures 22-24 using the lead frame material 1, is
mounted (fixed) with silver paste 14 on mounting pad 11 as shown in Figures
19-21. Pad 17 is bonded to inner lead 7 with wire 15, and structured to be
totally sealed with resin 16 such as epoxy, etc. In Figure 20, the alternating
long and short dashed line indicates the outer line of sealing resin 16 and
alternating long and two short-dashed line indicates the position of IC chip 
10.When manufacturing the package 13, IC chip 10 is mounted with
silver paste 14 on mounting pad 11 as shown in the enlarged figure of Figure
22.Next, heater member (heater insert or heater block) 18 is contacted to
mounting pad 11 from the bottom side during the wire bonding as shown in
Figure 23 so that heat of the heater is conducted to the bonding pad (pad 17)
simultaneous with supporting mounting pad 11.Wire bonding is executed by coupling wire 15 to bonding pad 17 with
capillary 19 while providing thermal and ultrasonic energy, guiding it to
inner lead 7 as indicated by arrow 20, then cladding it.As noted above, in the conventional package structure, mounting pad
11 of IC chip 10 was formed to be larger than IC chip 10, but this was mainly
due to the following reasons.First of all, if mounting pad 11 is
