<ABSTRACT>
A rear thrust bearing member (41) is disposed to be in 
frictional contact with an axial end face (42) of the 

spindle (34) supported in a cantilever fashion in the 
neighborhood of and on the rear side of an impeller 

(26). Frictional heat that is generated in this part 
is diffused satisfactorily with a cooling effect 

provided by the stirring of the impeller (26) in the 
pump casing and a heat diffusion effect provided by the 

circulating effect. Thus, the temperature rise of the 
frictional portions is suppressed, and adverse effects 

of heat on the surrounding member is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnet pump including a front casing defining an inner pump chamber and having an 
axially extending suction port and a circumferentially extending discharge port, an impeller 
rotatably disposed in the pump chamber, the impeller having a front side portion facing the 
suction port and a rear side portion opposite to the front side portion, a cylindrical rear 
casing with a bottom cooperating with the front casing to enclose the pump chamber fluid 
tight, a drive rotor disposed outside the rear casing and having a drive magnet, a driven rotor having a driven magnet facing and 
forming a magnet coupling with the drive magnet and rotatable in unison with the impeller 
which is mounted on a front side portion of the driven rotor, a spindle secured to the rear 
casing, said spindle having an axial end face at the extended end portion axially projecting 
toward the suction port and rotatably supporting the driven rotor and the impeller thereon, 
and a rear thrust bearing member for supporting a rearward thrust acting on the driven rotor 
and the impeller in the direction opposite to the direction toward the suction port. A magnet pump of this type is known (GB-A-1 134 228). The driven unit of this magnet 
pump including the driven magnet covers a bearing member being permanently pressed to a 
point of a pivot bearing pin. This pin and the bearing member constitute the only bearing for 
the driven magnet and the impeller. The extended end portion is always engaged and 
received by the bearing member which always supports the rotating unit radially and axially. A prior art magnetic pump of this type has a structure as shown, for instance, in Fig. 3. The 
well-known magnet pump 1 as shown in Fig. 3 comprises a front casing having a suction 
port 3 extending in the axial direction as shown by axis line X-X and a discharge port 4 
extending circumferentially, an impeller 6 rotationally disposed in the pump chamber 2 and 
having a front side portion (i.e., right side in the Figure), facing the suction port 2, a 
cylindrical rear casing with a bottom cooperating with the front casing 5 to enclose the pump 
chamber 2 liquid tight, a driven rotor 10 disposed outside the rear casing 7, having a ring-like 
drive magnet 8 and receiving a rotational drive torque from a drive motor (not shown).  
 
disposed in a pump body 9, a driven rotor 12 disposed 
in the rear casing 7, having a ring-like driven magnet 
11 facing and forming a magnet coupling with the drive 
magnet 8 via the rear casing and
