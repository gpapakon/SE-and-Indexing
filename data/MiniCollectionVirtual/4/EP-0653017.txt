<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device in internal combustion engines provided with a supercharger (2) of the rotary screw compressor type and a compressed air assisted fuel injection system (8, 9, 10). According to the invention a rotary screw compressor (2) of a kind known as such is used as the supercharger, which compressor through a special, from the ordinary outlet port (13) separated, outlet port (21) delivers a minor air flow of high pressure after closing of the ordinary outlet port, which special port (21) by a pressure pipe (7) is connected to the fuel injection system (8, 9, 10) for pressurizing this.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device in internal combustion engines provided with a 
supercharger of the rotary screw compressor type and a compressed air assisted fuel injection 
system, in which the supercharger includes a casing provided with outlet and inlet end walls 
with inlet port and outlet port and two rotors, one being a male rotor and the other one a 
female rotor, which have helically extending lobes and intermediate grooves, the intermeshing 
lobes of the rotor and the casing forming towards the outlet end wall movable chambers with 
an overpressure of about 1 to 2 bars as the rotors rotate. In many engine constructions with fuel injection direct into the combustion chamber or 
alternatively into the intake manifold a pressure source of a relatively high pressure, such as 
about 5 bars overpressure is required in order to attain an adequate injection. In some cases the 
injection must take place so fast that the fuel has to be mixed with and injected with the 
compressed air. For this purpose a suitably driven compressor, e.g. a small reciprocating 
compressor is provided irrespective of if the engine is supercharged or not. In the case the 
motor is supercharged with a compressor this means mounting of further a component in 
connection with the engine with increasing costs as a consequence. A compressor for this purpose is known by EP-A-0 458 670 disclosing a screw compressor 
providing air at two different pressures, the higher of which is used to assist the injection of 
fuel. If an air pressure of about 5 bar is requested for assisting the injection of fuel two screw 
compressors are preferably used in series connection. The object of the invention is to attain a corresponding function for the fuel injection of a 
supercharged engine without the requirement to provide a particular compressor for the fuel 
injection. This has according to the invention been achieved in that a rotary screw compressor of a kind 
known as such is used as the supercharger, which compressor through a special, from the 
ordinary outlet port separated, outlet port delivers a minor air flow of considerably higher 
pressure than that from the ordinary outlet port of the compressor after that the ordinary outlet  
 
port has been closed, which special outlet port by a pipe is connected to the fuel injection 
system for pressurizing this with a considerably higher pressure than the outlet pressure of the 
supercharger. In this way the air volume enclosed between the rotors and the casing at the 
outlet end

<CLAIMS>
Internal combustion engine provided with a supercharger (2) of the rotary 
screw compressor type and a compressed air assisted fuel injection system (8, 9, 10), in which 

the supercharger includes a casing provided with outlet and inlet end walls with inlet port and 
outlet port (13, 15) and two rotors (14), one being a male rotor (14M) and the other one a 

female rotor (14F), which have helically extending lobes and intermediate grooves, the intermeshing 
lobes of the rotors and the casing forming towards the outlet end wall movable 

chambers as the rotors rotate, wherein a rotary screw compressor (2) is used as the supercharger, 
and is provided with a special, from the ordinary outlet port (13, 15) separated, outlet 

port (11, 21) creating a pressure that differs from the ordinary outlet pressure, 
characterized
 in 
that said special outlet port (11, 21) is located in the outlet end wall (12) in a position such that 

the air volume enclosed by the rotors at the outlet end after final compression will be located 
to face the special outlet port (11, 21) when the desired pressure level is reached delivers a 

minor air flow of considerably higher pressure than that delivered from the ordinary outlet port 
(13, 15) of the compressor after that the ordinary outlet port has been closed, which special 

outlet port (11, 21) by a pipe (7) is connected to the fuel injection system (8, 9, 10) for 
pressurizing this with a considerably higher pressure than the outlet pressure of the 

supercharger. 
Engine according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that in the bottom of each groove of the 
female rotor (14F) adjacent to the outlet end wall (12) a narrow axially extending recess (20) is 

provided, which recesses at rotation of the rotors are arranged to one after another be brought 
in communication with the high pressure port (21) at a turning angle ofthe rotor when the 

pressure in the working chamber reaches the intended level.
