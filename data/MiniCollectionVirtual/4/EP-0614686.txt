<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a knee-pad for sportsmen, which comprises a cushioned member covering the knee at the front and at the sides and fastening means surrounding parts of the thigh and of the calf in the knee region. In order to achieve optimum protection the invention proposes that the fastening means comprise two fastening strips which adjoin the cushioned member (1) so as to extend approximately in parallel at two different heights and that the cushioned member (1) have a stretchable, elastic region (6) between the connection of the upper fastening strip (2) and the connection of the lower fastening strip (3). The elastic region connects two cushioned regions (4, 5) which are less stretchable.

Knee protector for sportsmen, having a padded portion 
covering the knee at the front and side, and further 

having attachment means surrounding parts of the thigh 
and of the lower leg in the region of the knee, said 

attachment means comprising two attachment strips (2,3) 
which are connected at two different heights to the 

padded portion (1) and extend roughly parallel, and which 
are annularly closed or closable on the one hand above, 

and on the other hand below, the knee joint, around the 
thigh or the lower leg, with the padded portion (1), and 

wherein the padded portion (1) forms central pads 
(10,11,12) lying one beneath the other with horizontal 

lines of abutment, of which an upper one (10) is 
allocated to the kneecap (R) and a lower one (12) to the 

shinbone (T), 
characterised by
 an expandable resilient 
area (6) between the binding of the upper attachment 

strip (2) and the binding of the lower attachment strip 
(3), which connects two less expandable padded areas, the 

pads (10,11,12)being substantially similarly formed as 
regular hexagons, and honeycomb-like lateral pads (13,14) 

connected to with the three pads (10,11,12), there being 
respectively associated with the pads (10) allocated to 

the kneecap and the lateral pads (13,14) notional points 
which encompass a triangle, the geometry of which changes 

only slightly relative to the kneecap (R) and the 
shinbone (T) when the knee is bent.  

 
Knee protector according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the lower padded area (5) comprises lateral pads 

(13,18,20) for protecting the condylis lateralis and 
medialis of the tibia. 
Knee protector according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the upper padded area (4) comprises 

lateral pads (8,17) for protecting the epicondylus 
lateralis and medialis of the femur. 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that there are inserted at the three 

pads (10,11,12), laterally-connecting pads (13,14,19,20) 
at least in the area of connection, in a honeycomb 

configuration, with delimiting angles of approximately 
120Â°. 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the upper padded area (4) and the 

lower padded area (5) respectively comprise a thin base 
layer (7;9) with pads (8,17;10,11,12,13,14,18,19,20) set 

thereon.  
 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the base layer (7;9) and the pads 

(8,17;10,11,12,13,14,18,19,20) are respectively 
integrally connected, and in particular consist of a foam 

material. 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the base layer (7;9) is self-supporting, 

and the resilient area connects therewith at 
the edges. 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the base layer (7;9) is applied to, 

especially stitched to, a carrier material (16), 
especially a textile material, which at the same time 

forms the resilient area (6). 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the base layer (9) has, between the 

pad (10) for the patella and the pads (13,20) for the 
condylis lateralis and medialis, a respective incision 

(15, 21) proceeding outwards from the outer edge, in 
order to increase mobility.  

 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the attachment strips (2,3) are 

attached, especially stitched, to the padded areas (4,5). 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the attachment strips (2,3) are 

constructed integrally with the carrier material (16). 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that hook-and-pile closures are attached 

to the free ends at least of the upper attachment strip 
(2). 
Knee protector according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the resilient area (6) between the 

padded areas (4,5) is of approximately constant width 
and, seen from the front, extends in the form of a bell 

curve above the pad ((10) for the patella (kneecap) and 
respectively below the pads (8,17) for the epicondylis 

lateralis and medialis of the femur.
