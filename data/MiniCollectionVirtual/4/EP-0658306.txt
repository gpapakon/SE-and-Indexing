<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a bait box (1) for controlling pests, the bait box consisting of a base part (2) which receives the poisoned bait (4) and a cover (3). The base part (2) is provided with mutually offset openings (8) for the entry and/or exit of ants. The object of the invention is seen in providing a bait box which can be closed easily and reliably at any time and, furthermore, cannot be dismantled easily. As a result, in particular, access to the contents by children is prevented. This object is achieved in that the base part (5) is designed as a first hollow cylinder (7) which consists of segment sections (6) and over which a second hollow cylinder (14), arranged correspondingly on the cover (3), is fitted so as to be rotatable. For this purpose, catch elements (12) are provided on the segment sections (6), which catch elements interact functionally in a defined end position with recesses (13), correspondingly formed in the second hollow cylinder (14), and connect the two hollow cylinders (7, 14) to one another in a fixed and rotatable manner. Additionally slot-like openings (19) are provided in the second hollow cylinder (14), which correspond to the openings (8) in the base part (2) in the open state of the bait box and form an outer access for the pests.

<CLAIMS>
A bait box for pest control consisting of a base
component (2) holding the attractant poison (4) that

is formed by a first hollow cylinder (7) with first
holes (8) in it and placed on a bottom (5), and a

cover (3) formed by a second hollow cylinder (14)
closed at one end face by a cap part (16) and

comprising second holes (19) at its perimeter, said
cover being placeable atop said base part (2) and

lockable to it by means of latching elements and
pivotable in said position in axial direction for

opening or closing said first holes (8),
characterized in that said first hollow cylinder (7)

is formed by segmental parts (6) starting from said
bottom (5) of said base part (2), arranged in annular

shape at a spacing, each held by an extra support (9)
connected to said bottom (5), and each comprising

latching elements (12) integrally mounted to its free
edges and projecting towards the inside of the

cylinder, and in that said second hollow cylinder
(14) forms an annular snap-in groove (28) for

receiving said latching elements (12) and for radial
guidance of said cover (3) with a cylinder part (18)

starting from said cap part (16) of said cover (3)
and a recess (13) in and around its outer surface.
The bait box according to claim 1, characterized in
that the end face (21) of said second hollow cylinder

(14) has cam-like projections (22) that can be
snapped into a predefined end position into

accordingly shaped recesses (23) provided at said
base part (2). 
The bait box according to claim 1, characterized in
that a cylindrical piece (25) is provided centrally

on the inside of said cap part (16) that holds the
attractant poison (4) between said cover (3) and said

base part (2).
The bait box according to claim 1, characterized in
that said cap part (16) comprises an edge (16a)

curving sidewards over said second cylinder (14) and
has a square base.
The bait box according to claim 1, characterized in
that two base parts (2) and covers (3) are provided

that are assembled at a joint (27) to form a double
pack (26).
