<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an anti-lock control system which, inter alia, employs wheel slip signals for brake pressure variation. Given continuous regulation by at least one control channel, the wheel speeds associated with a channel which is not performing regulation are excluded from the formation of the reference speed required for slip formation. This avoids a situation where the braking action is not optimum in the event of a brake circuit failure.
