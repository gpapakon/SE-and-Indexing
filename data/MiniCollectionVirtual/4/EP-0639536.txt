<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a septic tank which is 
designed to operate with aerobic microorganisms, rather 
than anaerobic microorganisms. The invention also 
relates to an apparatus and method for the modification of 
existing septic tanks, so that they can be converted from 
using anaerobic microorganisms to using aerobic 
microorganisms, and furthermore to septic tanks which 
incorporate this improvement. A common form of septic tank used at present is shown 
in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. Because of its 
shape it is known as an "onion tank". The tank comprises 
a substantially spherical body 10 with a tubular extension 
11 from its upper part. A conical shroud 12 defines a 
lower chamber 1. A circumferential partition 13 extends 
between the outer part of the shroud 12, about half way 
up, and the inner wall of the chamber 10, to define 
thereby an intermediate chamber 2 and an upper chamber 3. 
Openings 14 are provided in the lower part of the shroud 
12 to communicate between chamber 1 and chamber 2. 
Openings 15 are provided in the partition 13 to 
communicate between chambers 2 and 3. The upper part of 
the shroud 12 has an opening which would communicate 
directly between chamber 1 and chamber 3, but this opening 
is normally closed by a floating ball seal 16. An inlet 
17 is provided for incoming effluent, and passes from 
outside the tank directly into the lower chamber 1. An 
outlet 18 provides for the outflow of treated effluent, 
and passes from the upper chamber 3 to outside the tank. Effluent flows into the tank and solid matter settles 
towards the bottom of the lower chamber 1. The tank, in 
particular the chamber 1, contains anaerobic 
microorganisms which assist in the digestion of noxious 
substances. Septic tanks only convert solid matter to  
 
liquid by anaerobic microorganisms, and the effluent 
produced is "septic" and much inferior in quality to fresh 
crude sewage. In the course of treatment, effluent passes 
through the openings 14 from chamber 1 to chamber 2, and 
through the openings 15 from chamber 2 to chamber 3, from 
which it then leaves by the outlet 18. occasionally there 
is a need to desludge the tank. This is done by passing a 
suction tube through the extension 11, past the ball seal 
16 and to the bottom of the lower chamber 1. A problem with septic tanks such as that described 
above is that anaerobic microorganisms are not as 
effective as aerobic microorganisms in purifying the 
effluent. The present invention solves this problem by 
providing a

<CLAIMS>
1 A septic tank (10) which contains a biological 
aerated filter (21, 26, 27). 
2 A septic tank according to Claim 1, in which the 
biological aerated filter comprises an upright tube (21), 

open at the top and the bottom, provided with a packing of 
solid matrix (26) which provides a support for microbial 

biomass, and having an air diffuser at the lower end, so 
that, in use, air bubbles travel upwardly throughout the 

matrix and surrounding liquid waste. 
3 A septic tank according to Claim 2, in which the 
tube (21) is of cylindrical shape, the active area of the 

air diffuser (27) is circular, and the diameter of this 
active area is at least half the internal diameter of the 

tube. 
4 A septic tank according to Claim 2 or 3, in 
which the air diffuser (27) includes a perforated membrane 

which expands when supplied with compressed air to permit 
the escape of a stream of air bubbles throu
gh surrounding 
liquid.
