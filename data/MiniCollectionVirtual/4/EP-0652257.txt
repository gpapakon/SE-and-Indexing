<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silicone release compositions. 
It relates more specifically to release compositions 
which are not in the form of an emulsion and more 
preferably to solventless release compositions. The 
invention mainly relates to release modifiers for said 
compositions. Silicone release compositions have been known for a 
long time and have been the subject of many publications 
and patent specifications. They are useful in many applications 
where one requires a relatively non-adherent 
surface. In such applications release compositions are 
coated onto a substrate and are caused to be cured. A 
particularly useful application is the coating of paper, 
polyethylene and other materials which are used among 
other applications for providing non-stick surfaces for 
contact with food or for backing surfaces e.g. for 
pressure sensitive adhesive labels, decorative laminates 
and transfer tapes. This invention is not concerned with 
release compositions in the form of an aqueous emulsion. 
Solventless release compositions, which are the preferred 
subject matter of the present invention, have also been 
described in numerous publications. With solventless is 
meant compositions which do not include any organic 
solvent which could be environmentally undesirable. 
Examples of organic solvents are e.g. toluene and xylene. 
The advantages of using solventless systems are well known 
to the person skilled in the art of release coatings. Silicone release compositions have been described, 
for example in GB-1 374 792-A, which discloses a solvent-free 
curable silicone release coating composition, having 
a certain viscosity and comprising a polydimethylsiloxane  
 
having up to 5% vinyl radicals, an organopolysiloxane 
having at least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms and a 
catalyst for the addition of -SiH groups to Si-vinyl 
groups, the -SiH and Si-vinyl groups being present in a 
ratio of at least 0.5/1. In GB-1 542 072-A it was taught 
to mix a vinyl-containing resin in conjunction with a low 
molecular weight vinyl (cyclo) siloxane with the curable 
silicone composition to control the adhesive release 
force. In GB-2 045 788-A there is disclosed a composition 
similar to the one in GB-1 542 072-A, in which the low 
molecular weight vinyl siloxane can be left out. Cured release coatings which result from the 
application and curing of release compositions containing 
vinyl-substituted polydimethyl siloxanes and organosilicon 
compounds with silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms have a very 
low release
