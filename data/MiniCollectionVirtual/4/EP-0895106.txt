<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for fabricating a connector
ferrule (50) for a fiber optic ribbon cable (20) which

includes a plurality of generally parallel optical fibers
(22) in a line. A ferrule body (52) is provided with a

fiber passage (54) which is elongated in cross-section to
receive the line of optical fibers (22). A jacket (46) is

removed from an end portion of the fiber optic ribbon cable
(20) to expose the line of optical fibers. The ferrule

body (52) is placed in a fixture (62). The cable (20) is
placed in the ferrule body with the exposed line of optical

fibers (22) located in the fiber passage (54), and with
distal ends of the exposed fibers projecting outwardly of

the ferrule body (52). The exposed distal ends of the
fibers (22) are located on the fixture (62) to precisely

align the fibers relative to each other in the fiber

passage (54). A filler adhesive (98) is applied in the
fiber passage (54) about the exposed fibers (22) to fix the

fibers in the fiber passage while the fibers are held by
the fixture (62) in their precise alignment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of fabricating a connector ferrule, such as for terminating a multi-fiber cable, and to a fixture for carrying out the method, as well as to a fiber optic ribbon cable so produced.In fiber optic transmission systems, signals are transmitted along optical fibers by optical frequency waves (light) generated by such source as LED's, lasers and the like. Optical fibers typically are fabricated of glass materials and, as optical fiber circuitry developed, it became necessary to provide connecting devices which could couple one optical fiber to another, only in an end-to-end relationship.A traditional procedure for making a connection between ends of optical fibers is to, first, remove a protective jacket from a given length of fiber at the end of the fiber to be joined. After the jacket is removed, a 250 micron (OD) buffer is exposed which can then be stripped to expose a 125 micron (OD) fiber. The fiber is then threaded through a passage in a ferrule where it is affixed in place by adhesive and/or crimping. The fiber is inserted so as to extend well beyond a front surface of the ferrule. The exposed fiber material is then cleaved and polished. Any remaining adhesive is removed. The ferrules then are assembled into a connector assembly which is intended to position the optical fibers with their optical axes in alignment for connection to the fibers of a mating connector or other appropriate connecting device.A fiber optic ribbon cable has become increasingly popular to provide multiple channels in a single cable structure. An optical ribbon cable is similar to any other well known ribbon electrical cable to the extent that a plurality of generally parallel optical fibers or channels are disposed in a line or generally coplanar relationship. Terminating the optical fibers of a fiber optic ribbon cable is generally similar to the procedure described above. In general, the unitary protective jacket surrounding the line of fibers is removed so that the buffered fibers are exposed which are then stripped and the unprotected fibers project from the flat cable in a line. Typically, these individual fibers must be inserted into respective individual holes or passages in a prefabricated connector ferrule (see WO-A-97/222 027 = EP-A-0 810 456). The passages align the fibers at a predetermined spacing for coupling to the ends of the fibers in a complementary connector ferrule or other connecting device.This terminating process of the individual fibers of a multi-fiber cable, creates a
