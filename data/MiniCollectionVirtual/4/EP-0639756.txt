<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method to monitor the gas flow through injector nozzles. The method is characterised in that the pressure is determined in the draft tube connected downstream of the injector nozzle. In addition, a description is given of an injector nozzle which comprises a draft funnel (1), which is lengthened by an injector tube (4), and which opens into a gas distributor chamber (2), which is equipped with at least one gas supply line (3), and which gas distributor chamber (2) is connected via a curved surface of rotation (5) to an exit channel (6), which is followed by a draft tube (7), the longitudinal axis of the injector tube (4) coinciding with the longitudinal axis of the exit channel (6) and the downstream-positioned end of the injector tube (4) lying at the level of the connection of the exit channel (6) to the curved surface of rotation (5). The injector nozzle according to the invention is characterised in that the draft tube (7) has a pressure measuring device (8). In addition, a description is given of an injector nozzle arrangement which comprises a plurality of the injector nozzles defined above and a selection switch, by means of which the pressure measuring devices (8) of the individual injector nozzles can be interrogated sequentially. A transducer, which preferably has one indicator device per injector nozzle, is driven by the selection switch. The described injector nozzle arrangement can be used, in particular, for measuring the gas throughput of the draft nozzles in the production of spunbonded materials.
