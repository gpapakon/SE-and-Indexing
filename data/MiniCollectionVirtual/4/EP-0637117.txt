<ABSTRACT>
The support for positioning a shrinkable sleeve is constituted by a rigid tubular body for holding the support in expanded form. It is characterised in that the tubular body includes a series of parallel annular rings, each provided, on the one hand, with rupture areas (31 to 34) and, on the other hand, with fasteners (41 to 44) for bonding this ring to the adjacent one, the fasteners being on each side of each rupture area. Application: putting the sleeve into place on a rigid element, such as a cable joint or a cable termination.
