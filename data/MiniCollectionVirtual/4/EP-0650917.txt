<ABSTRACT>
An elevator car has a car door (22) having a 
arcuate cross-section and attaching to and rotating 

about a pivot (122,124). A hoistway door (18) has an 
arcuate cross-section and is selectively coupled to a 

car door to open and close therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new elevator door 
system. Elevators have doors that have been configured in 
basically the same ways for many years: each elevator 
car has one or more center or side opening doors to 
protect passengers as the car moves; and each landing 
has one or more hoistway doors that are configured 
similarly to the car doors to prevent passengers from 
entering the hoistway when the car is not at the 
landing. Some landings utilize a single hoistway door 
that pivots open and shut like a house door. Hoistway and car doors are supported similarly. 
The doors are suspended from their upper edges by 
rollers that travel longitudinally in a track attached 
to a lintel. The doors are guided at their bottom edges 
by gibs that slide in a slot in a sill. For safety reasons, hoistway doors are required to 
close automatically. A spring device may be used to 
close the doors or a weight is attached to the doors by 
a cable that travels over a series of pulleys. The 
weight forces the doors to close unless there is a 
countervailing force. The hoistway and car doors are opened and closed by 
a door operating unit. The unit is disposed atop an 
elevator car and is attached to each car door via a 
complicated mechanical linkage. Each car door, in turn, 
is coupled, at the proper time, by a pair of rollers 
that clamp a vane attached to the hoistway doors. Viewed from one aspect the present invention 
provides an elevator door system comprising:
 
   a hoistway door having a first curvilinear cross-section,
 
   a car door having a second curvilinear cross-section,  
 
said car door being attached to and rotating 
about a pivot, and
 
   a coupling for joining said hoistway and car doors 
so that the hoistway and car doors open and close 
together. This invention, at least in its preferred forms, 
provides several remarkable advantages: 
By utilizing curved hoistway and car doors, 
center opening doors may be used in a narrow 
hoistway thereby eliminating the need for 
maintenance and service intensive two-speed 
side-opening doors; By supporting the car door by a pivot, rollers 
and tracks are eliminated. Rollers require 
frequent maintenance and repair and are also a 
source of unwelcome noise. Tracks are easily 
damaged and trap and accumulate dirt, thereby 
impeding the travel of the rollers; By supporting the car door by a pivot, gibs 
are eliminated. Gibs are subject to sticking 
in their slots and may be impeded by dirt and 
other debris that accumulate in their closed 
bottom slots; By
