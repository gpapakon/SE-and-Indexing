<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a mapping and
ablation system for use in the field of cardiac
arrhythmia ablation. The object of the invention is
directed to the provision of a deflectable, size and
shape adjustable, electrode array loop, which
allows the operator to rapidly map heart chambers and
including the tricuspid annulus and ablate the desired
tissue using the same mapping electrode in the array that
is positioned on or near the site that should be ablated.Normal cardiac pacing, in a healthy heart, is
controlled by a special structure known as the sinoatrial
node (SA node). This is the natural pacemaker of the heart
and is a specialized tissue located within the muscle walls
of the right atrium. The SA node provides impulses which
dominate the inherent or natural rhythmic
contractions of the heart atria and the ventricles. This
dominance or control involves the transmission of ionic
impulses through cardiac conduction pathways in the atria
and the ventricles which cause the heart to contract and
relax in an orderly sequence at a rate dictated by the SA
node. This sequence ensures that blood flow to the
systemic circulation or the pulmonary system will be
maximized with each ventricular contraction. The SA node
has its own inherent rate which can be modified by signals 
from the nervous system. In response to excitement,
physical activity, etc., the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems react to modify the rate.A depolarization impulse begins with the SA node and
spreads as an electrical wave from its location in the
right atrium across to the left atrium and down toward the
transition zone between the atrium and the ventricles where
another node, known as the atrioventricular (A-V) node or
junction, is located. This impulse conducts through the A-V
node in a slower fashion and continues to a common
pathway known as the bundle of His between the right and
left ventricles, then into multiple paths called right and
left bundle branches, each bundle branch supplying one
ventricle. These bundle branches then divide into an
extensive network of finer paths of conducting tissue which
spread from the inner to the outer surfaces of the heart
and which are referred to as the Purkinje fibers. These
fibers feed the depolarization impulse into all portions of
the ventricular myocardium.As long as this system is intact, impulses are
transmitted normally and cardiac rhythm is maintained. The
natural impulse or current flow in the cardiac conduction
system, however, may be interrupted or altered

<CLAIMS>
A mapping and ablation system comprising:

(a) a main catheter including a tube (18) having a proximal end
and a distal end:
(b) a distal adjustable loop (20) at the distal end of the tube of the
main catheter and further having generally oppositely

disposed sections (28,30) and carrying an electrode array
including a plurality of individually connected

mapping/ablation electrodes (36) in conductive relation to the
external environment and arranged in spaced serial relation

along the adjustable loop (20);
c) insulated conductor means (25,27) connecting the individual
electrodes with an input/output device outside the catheter for

mapping the electrical activity of the chamber wall contacted
and ablating tissue as indicated; and
d) loop control means
e) characterised in that the loop sections (28,30) are tubular and
are attached to the distal end of the tube (18) of the main

catheter, and the loop control means comprises a pair of
tension control members (24,26), each connected with a

respective loop section (28,30) and extending along the main
catheter tube (18) for use in applying an adjustable amount of

tension to, or relax, the associated loop section for adjusting
and controlling the shape and posture or deflection of the

adjustable array loop.
The mapping and ablation system of Claim 1 wherein each of said
control members (24,26) is a control wire; and the loop control means 

further comprises tensioning means (64,72;66,74) for controlling the
tension applied by each control member (24,26).
The mapping and ablation system of Claim 1 wherein the tension
control members (24,26) are threaded in and extend through the respective

loop sections (28,30) and extend the length of the main catheter tube (18)
and are each connected separately to a respective one of the loop sections

(28,30).
The mapping and ablation system of Claim 1 wherein the main
catheter further comprises:


a control handle means (50) for controlling the mapping and
ablation system, connected to the proximal end of the main catheter (18);

and
a pair of tension control means (64,72;66,74) in the handle means
(30) each associated with a corresponding tension control member (24,26)

for separately controlling the tension in each such tension control member.
The mapping and ablation system of Claim 4, wherein each tension
control means comprises a hand-operable releasable tension controlling

ratchet member (72,74) to which the respective tension control member

(24,26) is fixed, the rotation of which causes the respective tension control
member to wind and unwind and accordingly to apply tension to and relax

the affected portion of the loop.
The mapping and ablation system of Claim 5, wherein the tension
control means further comprises resilient release means (86,88) for

individually disengaging each ratchet member (72,74) to thereby release
tension on the corresponding tension control member (24,26). 
The mapping and ablation system of any preceding claim wherein
the electrodes (36) are raised and have exposed outer surfaces directed

away from the loop which are substantially flattened to present a larger
electrode contact surface to tissue contacted which is situated generally

perpendicular to the plane of the loop formed.
The mapping and ablation system of Claim 1, wherein the tube (18)
of the main catheter has a tube wall that is further characterised by having

a segment thereof extending to the distal end, having a thermoplastic
nature providing the ability to be heated and shaped as desired, the shape

being retained upon cooling.
The mapping and ablation system of any preceding claim, wherein
the loop has a distal extremity and further comprises a short extension (22)

beyond the distal extremity of the loop segment to aid in positioning the
loop as for use at the tricuspid valve.
