<ABSTRACT>
A phase retarder film or sheet is produced by 
continuously supplying a stretched thermoplastic resin 

film (or sheet) to a heating zone in a direction parallel 
to the stretching direction of the film or sheet. The 

film is heated to a temperature not lower than the glass 
transition temperature of the resin, while applying pressure 

to the surface of the film or sheet passing through the 
heating zone. The film is thereby continuously subjected 

to thermal relaxation while suppressing the expansion 
of the film in a direction parallel to the film surface 

and perpendicular to the stretching axis. By this process 
a phase retarder film or sheet having a low angular dependence 

of retardation can be continuously produced. By 
employing the phase retarder film(s) or sheet(s) thus 

obtained as optical compensator(s), the viewing angle 
characteristics of liquid crystal display devices can 

be remarkably improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
continuously producing a phase retarder film or sheet
used in liquid crystal display devices, etc.Phase retarder films or sheets each comprising
a uniaxially oriented thermoplastic resin film or sheet
have been used as optical compensators to enhance display
qualities of liquid crystal display devices.A STN type liquid crystal display device using
such phase retarder film(s) or sheet(s) as optical
compensator(s) is advantageous in that it is lighter in
weight, thinner and less expensive, but disadvantageous
in that it has a narrow viewing angle characteristic and
exhibits a low contrast ratio as compared with a STN
double cell type liquid crystal display device using a
liquid crystal cell as optical compensator.These disadvantages have been considerably
eliminated by, for example, laminating two plies of phase
retarder films or sheets, but the viewing angle
characteristic has not reached a satisfactory level.The viewing angle characteristic of a liquid
crystal display device using phase retarders as optical
compensators greatly depends not only upon the angular 
dependence of the birefringence of the liquid crystal
cell used therein but also upon the angular dependence of
the retardation of the phase retarder. In conventional
phase retarders, it is known that lower angular
dependence of retardation gives a superior result.The angular dependence of retardation of a
phase retarder film or sheet is expressed by a retardation
ratio R40/R0. In this case, the retardation R40 is a
value measured with the phase retarder film or sheet
being tilted by 40° from the horizontal condition by
rotating around an axis which corresponds to the slow
axis if the phase retarder consists of a thermoplastic
resin having a positive intrinsic birefringence, or to
the fast axis if the phase retarder consists of a
thermoplastic resin having a negative intrinsic birefringence;
the retardation R0 is a value measured with the
phase retarder film or sheet not being tilted (i.e.
arranged horizontally); and the measurement is made using
a polarizing microscope equipped with a Sénarmont compensator.
As the retardation ratio of a phase retarder is
closer to 1, its angular dependence of retardation is
lower.In order to make low the angular dependence of
retardation of a phase retarder film or sheet, there were
proposed, for example, the following methods.A method of shrinking a film in a direction
perpendicular to the stretching axis at the time of the
uniaxial stretching [Japanese Patent

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a phase retarder film or sheet,
comprising supplying a stretched thermoplastic resin film

or sheet to a heating zone and heating the film or sheet to
a temperature not lower than the glass transition

temperature of the resin while applying pressure to the
surface of the film or sheet passing through the heating

zone, wherein the stretched thermoplastic
resin or sheet is continuously supplied to the heating zone

in parallel with the stretching direction of the film or
sheet, thereby continuously subjecting the film or sheet to

thermal relaxation while suppressing the expansion of the
film or sheet in a direction parallel to the surface of the

film or sheet and perpendicular-to the stretching axis.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the heating
zone is a pair of heat rolls.
