<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ethylene-α-olefin 
copolymer having excellent physical properties 
and moldability and to a molded article thereof. More 
particularly, it relates to an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer 
which exhibits excellent moldability and physical 
properties required for use as films, blow moldings, injection-moldings 
such as high transparency, high gloss, 
high impact strength and high modulus. Further the 
present invention relates to a molded article, 
especially a film, obtained from said ethylene-α-olefin 
copolymer. Linear, low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) prepared 
by ionic polymerization which is a copolymer of 
ethylene and an α-olefin exhibits excellent mechanical 
properties, such as impact strength, tensile strength 
and resistance to environmental stress-cracking, as 
compared with those of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) 
prepared by radical polymerization, and has therefore 
been used widely as starting materials for films, blow 
moldings and injection moldings. However, LLDPE has certain undesirable properties 
such as low melt tension and unsatisfactory transparency. For example, when a film is formed from a  
 
polymer having a low melt tension by a conventional 
inflation molding method, the bubble stability is 
inferior and the film-formation is difficult. 
Moreover, when a polymer having a low melt tension is 
used in the blow molding processes, the extruded molten 
parison deforms greatly owing to its own weight, and 
hence, its use is limited. Therefore, in a part of utilization field, 
LDPE is used or LDPE is mixed with LLDPE for the purpose 
of enhancing the transparency and melt tension of LLDPE. 
However, this has such problems that a labor hour is 
required for the mixing and when LDPE is mixed the mechanical 
strength which is the original feature of LLDPE 
is lowered. Under such circumstances, the present 
inventors have made extensive research on the melt 
tension and transparency of LLDPE, and have consequently 
found a novel specific ethylene-α-olefin copolymer whose 
optical properties such as transparency, gloss and the 
like and moldability have greatly been improved without 
impairing the mechanical properties including impact 
strength, tensile strength, stiffness and the like. An object of this invention is to provide an 
ethylene-α-olefin copolymer having high melt tension and 
high transparency and satisfying all the above-mentioned 
physical properties and moldability.  
 Another object of this invention is to provide 
a molded article,
