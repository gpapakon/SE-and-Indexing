<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the control of 
Take-All disease in plants, particularly cereals, by the 
use of certain substituted aryl compounds, novel 
compounds for use in the method, and fungicidal 
compositions for carrying out the method. Take-all disease is a serious problem in the 
production of cereals, particularly wheat and barley. 
It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Gaeumannomyces 
graminis (Gg). The fungus infects the roots of the 
plant, and grows throughout the root tissue, causing a 
black rot. The growth of the fungus in the roots and 
lower stem prevents the plant from obtaining sufficient 
water and/or nutrients from the soil, and is manifested 
as poor plant vigor and, in severe instances of disease, 
by the formation of "whiteheads," which are barren or 
contain few, shriveled grains. Yield losses result. 
Gaeumannomyces species also infect other cereal crops, 
for example, rice and oats; and turf. Currently the primary means of avoiding crop loss due 
to infestation of the soil by Gg has been to rotate the 
crop grown to one which is resistant to Gg. However, in 
areas where the primary crops are cereals, rotation is 
not a desirable practice, and an effective control agent 
is greatly desired. EP-A-0 360 417 discloses fungicidally effective compounds of 
the formula 
 
where 
R1 is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or akynyl; 
and either 
(i) A is hydroxy, XR2, NR2R4 or NHNR3R4, and 
a) B is hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl, each of which is optionally substituted, nonaromatic 
heterocyclyl or the group COR4, COOR2, CXNR2R3, SO2R2, SO2NR5R6, PX(OR2)2 or PX(NR5R6)2, 
or b) B and R1 together represent = CR2R3, where R2 and R3 are as defined below or together are 
alkylene: or (ii) A and B together with the atoms to which they are attached can form a ring, in which case R1 can 
also represent a bond between the nitrogen to which it is attached and B; R2 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or 
alkynyl, each of which is optionally substituted, or is aryl or a non-aromatic heterocyclyl group; R3 is hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl, each of which is optionally substituted, or is -SO2R4; R4 has the same meaning as R2 or is hydrogen; R5 and R6 are the same or different optionally substituted alkyl or alkenyl groups; X is oxygen or sulphur;  
and where -NR2R3, -NR3R4 and -NR5R6 can form a ring; and agiculturally acceptable salts with an organic 
or inorganic base of any compound which is an acid or with an organic or inorganic
