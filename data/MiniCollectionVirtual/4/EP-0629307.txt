ft.SYNCHRONIZATION AND AUTOMATIC RESYNCHRONIZATION OF MULTIPLE INCREMENTAL RECORDERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1 . Field of the Invention5 This invention relates to the field of dynamic information storage and retrieval, and in particular to a method and apparatus for synchronizing and resynchronizing multiple incremental digital cassette recorder (DCRSi) units.2. Description of Related ArtIncremental recorders are information storage devices which buffer the 10 variable user data rate from the internal fixed high-speed-read-write rate of the recorder. An example of an incremental recorder is the digital magnetic recording tape cassette (DCRSi) unit sold by Ampex Corporation. 

 Synchronization of multiple DCRSi units, or other incremental recording units, permits the user to achieve a high bit rate recording device that appears to the system as a single device. Data received from the host system is disassembled by the synchronization controller and buffered by the individual recorder units for simultanous recording. Retrieved data is reassembled and sent to the host system in its original format. Such synchronization results in recording capabilities beyond what is available for a single machine.A disadvantage with using multiple DCRSi and other recording units is that, when one or more of the units loses synchronization during playback, operator intervention is required to attain ^synchronization of the recorders. At present, no system is known for achieving synchronization and automatic resynchronization of multiple DCRSi or other incremental recording units.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an objective of the invention to provide a system capable of synchronization and automatic resynchronization of multiple DCRSi units.This objective is achieved by injecting a frame sync word at periodic intervals simultaneously into each unit during recording, and monitoring retrieved data for the frame sync words during playback. If synchronization is lost, each unit is automatically adjusted to achieve resynchronization.A frame sync decoder is provided for each recording unit in order to monitor the data stream for the occurrence of the frame sync word in each of the DCRSi channels, after which a frame sync detect sequencer inputs the decoded frame 

sync words and outputs individual frame sync gates for each of the DCRSi channels to a synchronization monitor.The synchronization monitor monitors the occurrence of the frame sync gates on each operating channel and adjusts the synchronization of the data
