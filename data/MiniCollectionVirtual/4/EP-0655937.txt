<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of depth filters,
and more particularly to a depth filter cartridge comprising a filter element
constructed of a plurality of substantially continuous discrete filaments which
are collected to form a generally tubular depth filter cartridge. The present
invention also relates to a method and apparatus for making such a filter
cartridge.Several processes and apparatus for forming depth filters comprised
of a plurality of substantially continuous filaments currently exist in the prior
art. In this art, fiber forming devices or fiberizers are used to spray filaments
of synthetic resinous material toward a rotating collection mandrel to be
formed into a tubular configuration. During this process, jets of air or other
gases act on the filaments to attenuate such filaments to a comparatively fine
diameter and convey the same to the collection device. Several specific
processes have evolved from this general concept.One of these processes is described in United States Patent No.
3,825,379 issued to Lohkamp et al. and United States Patent No. 3,825,380
issued to Harding et al. Both disclose a process die or fiberizer consisting of a
die head containing separate passages for the filament material and the
attenuating air. During operation, molten resinous material fiber is forced
through small holes in the die head toward a collection device and is
attenuated by air streams positioned on opposite sides of the filament outlet
holes. The collection methods utilized with this process include either a
rotating drum such as shown in these patents to form a continuous mat or a
rotating mandrel together with a press roller to form a tubular depth filter.
This latter process is a non-continuous or semi-continuous process in which 
the diameters of the plurality of filaments is constant throughout the entirety
of the element.A second process is exemplified by United States Patent No. 4,240,864
issued to Lin et al. This patent discloses a process die or nozzle block which
delivers a plurality of filaments toward a rotating collection device.
Associated with the filaments are attenuating air streams which function to
attenuate the filaments as they travel toward the collection device. This
patent also discloses a press roll for varying the pressure applied to the
accumulating fibers on the rotating mandrel so as to provide a filter of
varying fiber density. Like the process of Lohkamp et al. and Harding et al.,
the diameter of the individual filaments in this process is
