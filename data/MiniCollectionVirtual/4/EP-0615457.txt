<DESCRIPTION>
 A UNIFIED MEDICAL FLUID SYSTEM Field of the invention The invention relates to a unified system for delivering fluids to and extracting fluids from the human body. Each system component is joined by a reusable quick-connect, quick-disconnect coupling device incorporating a novel mechanical locking and release means. In this unified system both the health care provider, e.g., physician, nurse, etc., and the patient are protected at every juncture within the system from exposure to needles or other sharp objects. Each juncture results in a positive mechanical lock, as opposed, for example, to a frictional fit, and a protected, enclosed fluid transfer means. Specifically, this invention relates to quick-connect couplers primarily for use in the medical field and, more particularly, to a coupling incorporating a fluid transfer means, such as needle-like structures.Background of the Invention Delivering fluids to and extracting fluids from the human body is a basic part of the physicians task in the treatment of patients. Fluids delivered include a variety of solutions, and fluids removed include human blood. Figure twelve illustrates typical components of a fluid delivery or extraction system; some of these components include an intravenous solution bag (I.V. bag) 

 or bottle container, a syringe , medication bottle, nasogastric tube, a urethral catheter, tubing, etc. To interact with and utilize these components the physician is often exposed to unprotected needles. Furthermore, the interconnections among devices often disconnect, spilling contaminated fluids upon patients, health care personnel, and hospital equipment. A great deal of time is consumed in making often unreliable connections among fluid transport systems. The couplings presented in the present invention overcome the difficulties of the prior art and permit the construction of a unified system, e.g., a system where all components are joined with the same universal couplers.Quick connect assemblies have been known in the prior art for many years. Areas in which quick-connect couplings have been applied include hydraulics, pneumatics, plumbing, and so on. Such connector assemblies, while widely used in areas such as industrial tubing connectors and electrical connectors, have had limited successful application to areas involving fluid delivery for medical or health care purposes. Few of the prior art quick-connect, fluid flow couplings have successfully incorporated needle or needle-like structures within the internal structure of the

What is claimed is:
1. A quick connect fluid coupling assembly, said assembly comprising: a primary body having longitudinal axis and defining a centrally disposed elongated channel extending longitudinally therethrough, wherein the primary body comprises a non-flexible central portion, a flexible retaining portion, and a connecting portion connecting said non-flexible portion and said flexible portion; a needle member disposal within said elongated channel and extending coaxially therewith, said needle member being attached to the non-flexible portion of the primary body, wherein a sharp-tipped end of said needle member terminates within the elongated channel; and a conduit body having an open end and a diaphragm covering the open end, wherein the conduit is removably disposed within said elongated channel such that a fluid- light seal is effected between the diaphragm and the needle member. 2. An assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein a distal end of said conduit body comprises connecting means for connecting said conduit body to a fluid source.
3. An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said flexible portion comprises an elliptically shaped receiving means for receiving said conduit body, said elliptically shaped receiving means being changeable to 


 more circular shape upon application of an external force directed radially inward along a major axis thereof.
4. An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said flexible portion comprises an elliptically shaped receiving means for receiving said conduit body, said elliptically shaped receiving means being changeable to more circular shape upon application of a force directed radially outward along a minor axis thereof.
5. An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said flexible portion comprises a ring integrally connected with, and at essentially right angles to, said connecting portion.
6. An assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein said connecting portion comprises two longitudinally extending sections positioned opposite to one another and flexible in a plane including the longitudinal axis of the primary body, each of said two longitudinally extending sections having a first end integrally connected to said central portion and a second end integrally attached to said flexible portion.
7. An assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said connecting means comprises a T-connector attachment. 


 8. An assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein said connecting means comprises a Y-connector attachment.
9. An assembly as in claimed in claim 2, wherein said connecting means is integrally formed with a syringe.
10. A quick connect fluid coupling assembly, comprising: a primary body comprising a rigid central portion, a flexible retaining portion comprising stop means, and a connecting portion integrally joining said rigid central portion and said flexible portion to form a centrally disposed elongated channel extending longitudinally through said primary body; a cylindrically shaped needle member disposed within said elongated channel and coaxial with the longitudinal axis of said primary body, said needle member comprising a first end integrally attached to said rigid central portion, and an opposite sharp-tipped end extending longitudinally outward from said rigid portion a sufficient length to terminate within said flexible portion of said primary body; a conduit body removably insertable through said flexible retaining portion into said centrally disposed elongated channel, said conduit body comprising an end wall surface on which is disposed a diaphragm for forming a fluid-tight sealing engagement with said needle 


member when said conduit is inserted into said elongated channel; and locking means for locking the conduit in the elongated channel by engagement of said conduit with said stop means.
