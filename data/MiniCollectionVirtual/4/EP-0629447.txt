<ABSTRACT>
A solid waste material comminuting system having a 
electric motor (24) for providing rotary motion, a pair of 

cutter stacks (44,46) with cutter elements of one stack 
interleaved with cutter elements of the other, and gear 

means (38,40) to transmit the rotary motion of the electric motor 
to counter-rotate cutter elements (48) of one stack (44) with 

cutter elements (48) of the other (46). Each of the cutter 
stacks (44,46) 

comprise a central shaft (36,37) journaled for rotation and a 
bearing module (54,56) at each end of the central shafts. Each 

bearing module comprises an end housing (58,60), and a pair of 
insertable pre-assembled bearing assemblies (54,56) mountable in 

each of said end housings (58,60). One bearing assembly (54,56) has a 
thru-hole for journaling a first shaft (37) for rotation and 

a second bearing assembly (54,56) has a thru-hole for journaling 
a second shaft (36) for rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid waste comminuting
apparatus. Such devices have been established in the art
and are now widely used in a variety of industrial
applications, such as municipal waste treatment and
industrial applications. Reference is made to U.S.
Patent 4,046,324, which discloses such a basic system
that has achieved commercial success,
and to EP-A-0 512 177, which discloses
the preamble of claim 1.By definition, comminution is the reduction of
particle size of solid waste material to minute
particles. It is generally performed by shearing,
shredding and crushing of the waste material. As set
forth in the '324 patent, comminution occurs by utilizing
a pair of counter-rotating intermeshed cutting members.The solid waste material is fed into the interface
between cutting elements, typically utilizing a fluid
carrier medium, and shearing action occurs because the
two cutters overlap each other such that opposing forces
of counter-rotation of the cutting elements on the
different stacks act on the solid material as it passes
through the device.In practice, such devices are generally used in an
influent path. That is, the solid material is generally
entrained in a liquid and the device is placed directly
in the liquid stream. By having the solid material
entrained in a liquid stream transportation of the
material to and from the unit occurs. Further, by
softening the solid particles, a greater degree of
comminution is achieved. Devices of the type disclosed in
the '324 patent have found commercial success and are
widely used in waste treatment facilities, shipboard use
and the like. As can be appreciated, the environment of
use is very harsh for the equipment and as such, routine
maintenance is required in both a preventative sense and 
also to immediately repair break downs when they occur
thus minimizing system down-time.An important aspect of such maintenance and repair
is the integrity of the seals which provide the cutter
stacks to rotate while minimizing friction. Given the
mass of the cutter stacks together with high motor
torque, loads on the seals are large and thus seal
integrity is a primary consideration. In the past, two-shafted
machines such as the '324 device required that
the seal assembly be an integral part of the device.
Such is illustrated in Fig. 1 of the '324 patent. As a
result, if there was a seal failure other critical
components of the device were likely to be effected.
This failure of a seal could thus mean that bearings
could fail and seize up the cutter

Apparatus for comminuting solid waste material
comprising:


drive means (24) for providing rotary motion, a
pair of cutter stacks (44, 46) with cutter elements (48) of

one stack (44) interleaved with cutter elements of the
other, gear means (38, 40) to transmit the rotary motion of

said drive means (24) into counter-rotation of cutter
elements (48) of one stack (44) with cutter elements of the

other, each of said cutter stacks (44, 46) comprising a
central shaft (36, 37) journaled for rotation, and a seal-bearing

module (54, 56) mounted at each end of the central
shafts (36, 37), each of said modules comprising an end

housing (58, 60), characterized in that each of said end

housings (58, 60) comprises a pair of insertable pre-assembled
bearing-seal cartridges (62, 64) mountable in each of

said end housings, in that each of said bearing-seal cartridges
has a seal cartridge (74) and a bearing cartridge (88)

therein, in that the seal cartridge (74) of one
bearing-seal cartridge (64) has a thru-hole for journaling a first shaft

(36) for rotation and the seal cartridge of a second
bearing-seal cartridge (62) has a thru-hole for journaling a

second shaft (37) for rotation, in that a seal (98, 100) is
positioned in each end housing and contacting said first

and second bearing-seal cartridges (64, 62) to provide fluid
isolation between the respective bearing assemblies and an

associated end housing, and in that each of said pre-assembled
bearing assemblies (62, 64) comprises its own

internal seal arrangement (84).

cartridge and means (92) to secure said bearing in said

bearing assembly and to urge said static race (86) into 
contact with said dynamic race (82).
