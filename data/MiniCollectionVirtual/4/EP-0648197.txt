<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for delivering a substance into the bulk of an open-pore material (1, 16, 36), and the resulting material, are disclosed. A dispersion of ion species within a solution is caused to migrate electrophoretically through the bulk of said material, from a first to a second discrete area thereof, by means of an applied electrical field (E). The dispersion contains two reactive ion species (4, 5) with opposite signs. Said ion species are normally capable of interacting to give a hard and/or hydrophobic element (12). The one ion species whose sign is opposite to that of the zeta potential of the material is combined with a vector (13) having a zeta potential (14) with the same sign as that of the material. Stones or structures may thus be consolidated.

Process for introducing a substance into the bulk 
of a material (1, 16, 36) with open porosity, 

characterized 

in that an electrophoretic migration is produced in the 
bulk of this material of a dispersion of ionic species 

within a solution, under the effect of an electrical 
field (E) applied between a first region and a separate 

second region of this material, 
in that the said dispersion contains two reactive ionic 
species (4, 5) of opposite signs, these ionic species 

being normally capable of interacting with each other to 
produce a hard or hydrophobic component (12), or both at 

the same time, if appropriate on condition of a previous 
adjustment of their relative proportions within the 

dispersion in order to direct the said interaction toward 

the production of this hard or hydrophobic component, 
in that the one of the two ionic species whose charge 
is of opposite sign to the zeta potential of the material 

is associated with a vector (13) which has a zeta 
potential (14) of the same sign as that of the material, 

forming an electrically insulating barrier between the 
said species of opposite sign and at the same time the 

material and the other reactive ionic species, and whose 
stability can be preserved for a sufficient time to 

ensure an approximately uniform distribution under the 
effect of the electrical field between the first and  

 
second region in at least a part of the bulk of the 

material. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the substance of which the vector consists is such 

that an interruption in the application of the electrical 
field entails, ultimately or appreciably immediately, a 

disappearance of the barrier. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the substance of the vector is such that an 

appreciable increase in the electrical field beyond an 
approximately predetermined threshold entails a 

disappearance of the barrier. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the substance of the vector is such that a heat 

input external to the material beyond a certain

Process for introducing a substance into the bulk

particles within a solution, under the effect of an 
electrical field applied between a first region and a 

separate second region of this material, 
in that the said dispersion contains two reactive ionic 
species (4, 5) of opposite signs, these ionic species 

being normally capable of interacting with each other to 
produce a hard or hydrophobic component, or both at the 

same time, if appropriate on condition of a previous 
adjustment of their relative proportions within the 

dispersion in order to direct the said interaction toward 
the production of this hard or hydrophobic component,  

 
in that the electrical activity of the one of the two 
reactive ionic species (4) whose charge is of opposite 

sign to the zeta potential of the material is masked by 
associating it with a vector (13) which has a zeta 

potential (14) of the same sign as that of the material, 
forming an appreciably impervious electrical barrier 

between species and material of opposite signs as long as 
the operating conditions of electrophoretic diffusion are 

maintained, but unstable when other determined operating 
conditions are applied to the material, 
and in that the said other determined operating 
conditions are applied when the species are distributed 

approximately uniformly between the first and the second
