<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a window comprising at least a first sheet (16), and a second sheet (18), the said sheets (16, 18) being joined together by a bonding layer (20), characterised in that it further comprises an ultrasound detection device (12) located between the said sheets (16, 18) and interacting directly with a first face (24) of the said first sheet (16) so as to detect the presence of foreign bodies (matter) on a second face (26) of the said first sheet (16) opposite the said first face (24), the said device (12) comprising a transducer (28) which can, via an emitter/receiver face, emit an incident ultrasound signal of wavelength  lambda  into the said first sheet (16), the thickness of the said first sheet being equal to K lambda /2, where K is an integer, and the said transducer being able to receive, via the said emitter/receiver face, a reflected ultrasound signal representing the presence or absence of the said foreign bodies in order to formulate a detection signal.

<CLAIMS>
Window comprising at least a first sheet (16), 
a second sheet (18), said sheets (16, 18) being joined 

together by a connecting layer (20), such window further 
comprising an ultrasonic detection device (12) for 

detecting the presence of foreign bodies on the exterior 
surface of the window, said device (12) comprising a 

transducer (28) able to emit, via a transmitting/receiving 
face, an incidental ultrasonic signal in the window, said 

transducer being able to receive, via said 
transmitting/receiving face, a reflected ultrasonic signal 

representative of the presence or absence of said foreign 
bodies to generate a detection signal, the window being 

characterized in that the ultrasonic detection device (12) 
is placed between said sheets (16, 18) and co-operates 

directly with a first face (24) of said first sheet (16), 
the exterior surface of the window being constituted by 

the second face (26) of said first sheet (16) opposite 
said first face (24) and in that said transducer (28) is 

able to emit, via said transmitting/receiving face, an 
incidental ultrasonic signal having a wavelength λ in said 

first sheet (16), the thickness of said first sheet being 
equal to K.λ/2, where K is an integral number. 
Window according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the connecting layer (20) comprises a recess (22) in 

which extends said ultrasonic detection device (12). 
Window according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the second sheet (18) comprises a through opening 

(38) which extends approximately facing said recess. 
Window according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said opening (38) is closed by a cap (42). 
Window according to claim 4, in which said 
ultrasonic detection device (12) comprises a piezoelectric 

transducer (28) provided with electrodes (30,32) and 
conductors (34,36) connecting said electrodes (30,32) to a 

detection circuit, characterized in that said conductors  
 

(34,36) extend across the cap (42) in order then to extend 
over a face (44) of the second sheet (18). 
Window according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said recess (22) is closed by the second sheet (18). 
Window according to claim 6, characterized in 
that said detection device (12) is placed in a spacer 

forming a case (50) whose base (52) is partially cut away, 
said spacer being supported between the first and the 

second sheet (16,18). 
Window according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said detection device (12) is fixed 

onto said first face (24) by means of a film of glue (40). 
Window according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that said detection device (12) is fixed 

onto said first face (24) by welding 
Window according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said first sheet (16) is of a first 

thickness and in that said second sheet (18) has a second 
thickness different from said first thickness.
