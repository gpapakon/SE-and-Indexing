<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a device in 
the handling of recycling packages, such as bottles 

and cans. A recycling package is introduced into the 
package receiving space (A) of the device (10). The 

package that has been brought into the space (A) is 
transferred by means of a conveyor device (16) into 

a package identification position and further, based 
on the identification, to a crusher device, in which 

the package is brought into smaller volume before 
the package is passed into a storage container (S₁, 

S₂). The package is transferred out of the receiving 
space (A) by means of a transfer conveyor (16), 

which comprises lifting members (19) fixed to the 
conveyor run, the recycling package being placed 

on said lifting members. The package is lifted on 
the lifting member (19) to the identification position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and a device in the handling of recycling packages,
such as bottles and cans according to the preamble of claims 1 and 8.In the prior art, return automats are known, in which the recycling bottle or can is
passed into connection with a scanning reader device, which reads the code label
placed on the face of the product and, on its basis, identifies the product and
transfers said product to further processing/rejection (e.g. US-A-4 248 389).Document EP-A-0 082 735 discloses a return automat
in which recycling cans are transported from a receiving space
to a crusher device by a conveyor device comprising lifting
members. In the solution of equipment and method in accordance with the invention, the bottom part is
linked so as to pivot on hinge means and, if the weight of the recycling package
exceeds a certain maximum weight, a limit switch is switched on. In such a case, the
device does not transfer the recycling package further. In this way, the processing
of full packages is eliminated. A photocell detects a recycling package in the lifting
position. Moreover, a light curtain is placed at the mouth of the receiving space A.
When the light curtain does not detect an object, such as the hand of the person who
is returning the package, in the receiving space A and when the press switch
connected with the bottom part of the space A is not in the closed position, the
recycling package is transferred upwards by means of a tray part passing through an
opening in the bottom plate. The tray part is fixed to a belt, and the belt is passed
over three belt pulleys. By moving the belt, the recycling package is shifted onto two
rollers placed side by side, which are rotated so as to read the bar code.After the central unit has identified the recycling package either as an aluminium can
or as a plastic bottle, the receipt or the sum of money corresponding to the identification
data is delivered to the returning person, and the recycling package is
transferred away from the rollers onto the troughs passing to the plastic-bottle press
or to the can press. If the package is not identified, it is passed to rejection. In such
a case, the recycling package is brought back to the vicinity of the front panel of the
device into the reject opening, from which the returning person can pick up the
rejected package. When a plastic bottle is concerned, the package is shifted to the
side off the rollers and through the trough to the plastic-bottle processing device,
preferably a crusher device,
