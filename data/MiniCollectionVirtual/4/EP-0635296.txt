<ABSTRACT>
A liquid filter having an openable filter housing is described. This liquid filter is provided with an untreated liquid inlet 14 and a clean liquid outlet 15. In the filter housing is arranged a first filter element 32. This is essentially hollow-cylindrical in shape and flow passes through it from the outside to the inside. A further, likewise hollow-cylindrical filter element 41 is provided which is arranged inside the first filter element 32 and flow likewise passes through it from the outside to the inside. Between the two filter elements is situated a partition 45. The entire filter has a compact construction and is distinguished primarily by a high active filter surface area.

Liquid filter, having an openable filter housing,
an unfiltered liquid inlet (14), a filtered liquid outlet

(15), a filter element (32) which is disposed in the filter
housing, said element having a substantially

hollow-cylindrical configuration and being traversed
inwardly from the outside, and an additional, similar

hollow-cylindrical filter element (41) being provided,
characterised in that this additional filter element is

disposed internally of the first filter element (32) and is
si
milarly traversed inwardly from the outside, and a
dividing wall (45) being disposed between the two filter

elements, the second filter element (41) having a bypass
duct (46), through which the liquid which has been filtered

by the first filter element (32) flows, and a central tube
(28) being provided, which collects the filtered liquid,

and to which tube the filtered liquid is suppliable from
the first filter element (32) and from the additional

filter element (41); and the two filter elements (32, 41)
form a unit and are provided on their end faces with end

plates (34, 35), each end plate having a central bore
provided with a radial seal (37, 38), and the radial seal

(37, 38) abutting against the central tube (28) to seal
between unfiltered liquid chamber (39) and filtered liquid

chamber (40).
Liquid filter according to claim 1, characterised
in that the second filter element (41) has a bypass duct

(46), through which the liquid which has been filtered by
the first filter element (32) flows, and a central tube

(28) being provided, which collects the filtered liquid,
and to which tube the filtered liquid is suppliable from

the first filter element (32) and from the additional
filter element (41). 
Liquid filter according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the two filter elements (32, 41) form

a unit and are provided on their end faces with end plates
(34, 35), each end plate having a central bore provided

with a radial seal (37, 38), and the radial seal (37, 38)
abutting against the central tube (28) to seal between

unfiltered liquid chamber (39) and filtered liquid chamber
(40).
Liquid filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the filter elements (32, 41)

comprise a filter means (33) and end plates (34, 35), as
well as a dividing wall (45), the end plates (34, 35) and

the dividing wall (45) being detachably connected to the
filter means (33).
Liquid filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a filter bypass valve (24) is

provided between filtered liquid outlet (15) and unfiltered
liquid inlet (14).
Liquid filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the unfiltered liquid chamber

(39) and/or the filtered liquid chamber (40) are/is
provided with an aeration aperture (48), and the aeration

aperture (48) communicates with a supply vessel.
Liquid filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a bottom outlet valve (25) is

provided, which is actuatable by the cover (11) sealing the
housing (10).
Liquid filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a heating member (22) is

provided to heat the liquid flowing through the filter.
