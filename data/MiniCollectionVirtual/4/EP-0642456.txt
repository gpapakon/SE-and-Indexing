<ABSTRACT>
The device for inerting a storage tank (21) from a pressurised inert gas reservoir has a pressure sensing conduit (3) and an inerting conduit (6) connected to the storage tank, and an inert gas inlet conduit (4) connected to the inert gas reservoir. The inerting device comprises a pilot valve (1) and a supply valve (2) controlled by the pilot valve (1). The control inlet of the pilot valve (1) is connected to the pressure sensing conduit (3); the inlet and the outlet of the supply valve (2) are connected to the inert gas intake conduit (4) and to the inerting conduit (6) respectively.

Device for the inert-rendering of a storage 
container (21), using a cylinder of pressurized inert 

gas, the said device having a pressurizing pipe (3) and 
an inert-rendering pipe (6) which are intended to be 

connected to the storage container, and an inert-gas 
intake pipe (4) intended to be connected to the cylinder 

of inert gas, characterized in that it comprises a pilot 
valve (1), having one control inlet, one outlet and two 

inlets which are capable of communicating alternately 
with the said outlet, depending on the pressure at the 

said control inlet, and a supply valve (2) having one 
control inlet, one inlet and one outlet which are capable 

of being connected or not connected, depending on the 
pressure at the said control inlet, 


the control inlet of the said pilot valve (1) being 
connected to the pressurizing pipe (3), 
the inlets of the said pilot valve (1) being connected, 
on the one hand, to the intake pipe (4) and, on 

the other hand, to a reference pressure, this pressure 
being different from that in the intake pipe (4), 
the outlet of the said pilot valve (1) being connected 
via a pipe (5) to the control inlet of the said 

supply valve (2), 
the outlet of the said supply valve (2) being connected 
to the inert-rendering pipe (6), 
and the inlet of the said supply valve being connected 
to the inert-gas intake pipe (4). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pilot valve (1) and the supply valve (2) are 

constituted by slide valves.  
 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it has, upstream of the supply valve (2), a valve 

for adjusting the inert-rendering flow rate. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that it includes a low-pressure supply p
ipe 
(12) connecting the inert-gas intake pipe (4) to the 

pilot valve (1) via a filter (13) and via a pressure-reducing 
valve (14).
