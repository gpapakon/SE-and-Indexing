<CLAIMS>
A motorised drive unit, in particular for a screen
wiping apparatus, comprising an electric motor (11)

driving a speed reduction system (12) contained within
a casing which comprises a body (13), a cover (13a) for

closing the said body, and a closure plate (11a)
closing the yoke of the said motor (11), the said

casing carrying, on an outer surface (25), connecting
terminals (22, 21a, 21b, 21c) to which conductors (23,

19a, 19b, 19c) are soldered for supplying power to the
electric motor (11), together with a hood (17) for

overlying the said connecting terminals (22, 21a, 21b,
21c), characterised in that the connecting terminals

(22, 21a, 21b, 21c) are carried, firstly by the body
(13) and secondly by the closure plate (11a), and in

that the said hood (17) includes fastening means (20a,
20b) for force-fitting on the said body (13), and

spacing means.
A drive unit according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the hood (17) is U-shaped, having two arms (17a,

17b) of unequal lengths.
A drive unit according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the shorter arm (17b) of the said hood (17)

engages on the body (13), while the other arm (17a)
carries the said fastening means (20a, 20b).
A drive unit according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the means for force-fitting consist of a spigot

(32) cooperating with a bore (34) in the body (13). 
A drive unit according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the spacing means consist of a spacer (31)

situated between the longer arm (17a) of the said hood
(17) and the body (13).
A drive unit according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the hood (17) is of

electrically insulating material.
A drive unit according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the hood (17) is of

translucent material.
