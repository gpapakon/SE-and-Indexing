<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
semiconductor devices and more particularly to a
planar laser diode having a reduced optical loss.Planar laser diode is an essential device in
the field of optical parallel processing including
optical computing and optical interconnection. In the
planar laser diodes, an optical beam is emitted in the
direction perpendicular to the plane of the substrate.
Thus, the planar laser diode has an optical cavity that
causes a resonance in the vertical direction to the
plane of the substrate. Such a planar laser diode is
particularly advantageous with regard to the design of
optical computing system as well as with regard to the
possibility of expansion of the system. Further, the
planar laser diode has various advantageous features
such as low threshold current of oscillation associated
with the small volume of optical cavity, single mode
operation caused by the small optical cavity length,
easy coupling to an optical fiber due to the small beam
divergence, high yield of production associated with
the elimination of cleavage process in the fabrication
process, and easy test of the device in the state that
the laser diodes are formed on the wafer.FIG.1 shows the construction of a
conventional planar laser diode.Referring to FIG.1, the laser diode is
constructed on a semiconductor substrate 21 of a first
conductivity type, and a first reflecting structure 22
is provided on the substrate 21, wherein the reflecting
structure 22 is formed of a number of semiconductor
layers stacked with each other. More particularly, the
first reflecting structure 22 is formed of an alternate 
stacking of a first semiconductor layer having a first
refractive index and a second semiconductor layer
having a second, different refractive index, wherein
the first and second semiconductor layers forming the
first reflecting structure 22 are doped to the first
conductivity type. Further, a cavity structure 23 is
provided on the first reflecting structure 22 with a
thickness set equal to an integer multiple of one-half
the wavelength of the optical beam to be produced by
the laser diode. The cavity structure includes an
active layer 23a sandwiched from above and below with a
pair of cladding layers 23b, and produces an optical
beam by stimulated emission. Further, a second
reflecting structure 24, which has a similar
construction as the first reflecting structure 22
except that the semiconductor layers forming the
reflecting structure 24 are doped to a second, opposite
conductivity type, is
