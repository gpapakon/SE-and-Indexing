<ABSTRACT>
A method of surveying a wellbore is disclosed which 
utilizes a sensor array located within a drillstring within 

said wellbore, comprising measuring magnetic and 
gravitational fields with said sensor array at a particular 

depth and at a particular tool face orientation, utilising 
measurements of said magnetic and gravitational fields to 

calculate directly, algebraically, and non-iteratively at 
least one wellbore orientation indicator which is free of 

magnetic field biasing errors, either axial or transverse 
or both. The method may include angularly displacing the 

drillstring to at least one other tool face orientation and 
repeating the measuring step. Intermediate calculations 

may be carried out including comparing measurements of the 
magnetic field with expected values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to survey operations
in an oil and gas wellbore, and in particular relates to techniques for
compensating for biased magnetometer measurements in the determination
of azimuth.In order to understand the present invention, it is important to
establish the definitions of terminology utilized in wellbore survey operations.
Surveys are used to determine the position of a wellbore within the earth.
The orientation of the wellbore is determined at a particular depth by the
deviation of the wellbore from a predetermined axis. The deviations may be
measured with respect to two reference vectors:
(1) the earth's gravitational field vector "G"; and(2) the earth's magnetic field vector "B".
In accordance with this convention, G is positive in the vertical downward
direction, while B is positive in the north direction and is inclined by a dip
angle D below the horizon, as is shown in Figure 1.The position of the wellbore relative to the earth's gravitational
field vector G, is identified as an inclination "I" angle, which is the angle
between the longitudinal axis of the drillstring and the earth's gravitational
field vector G. The position of the wellbore relative to the earth's magnetic 
field vector B and the earth's gravitational field G is identified as a magnetic
azimuth "A", which is the angle between the horizontal component of the
longitudinal axis of the drillstring and the horizontal component of the earth's
magnetic field vector B.Wellbore survey operations are also frequently utilized to
determine the dip angle "D", which is the complement of the angle between
the earth's magnetic field vector B and the earth's gravitational field vector
G (that is, 90 degrees less the angle between vectors B and G). The dip
angle D is available in look-up tables, computer programs, and charts for all
latitudes and longitudes on the earth's surface.In conventional wellbore survey operations, accelerometers are
utilized to measure the direction of the earth's gravitational field vector G,
and magnetometers are utilized to measure the earth's magnetic field vector
B. Each vector, includes x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis components.In order to understand the techniques of the present invention
for compensating for the magnetic field biasing error "e", it is important first
to understand the coordinate systems utilized in surveying operations.
Figure 2 provides a view of the Cartesian coordinate system which is
established relative to the bottomhole assembly of a drillstring. The z-axis
