<ABSTRACT>
The equipment identity numbers of mobile station equipment (ME1 to MEn) are allocated to one of a plurality of equipment identity registers (B, G, W). These registers can be stored in compressed form by means of an algorithm (ALG). A block of 1000 equipment identity numbers (MEI1 to MEIn) is in each case addressed by means of a search key (KEY1 to KEYp). With different structure elements (S1 to Sq), a register association is allocated in each case within this block to individual equipment identity numbers, to ranges of equipment identity numbers or to an entire block.

Method for determining the assignment of a mobile 
station (ME
1
 to ME
n
) to equipment lists (B, G, W) each 
containing a number of equipment numbers (MEI
1
 to MEI
n
) 
that are uniquely assigned to mobile stations,
characterized in that
 
each equipment number (MEI
1
 to MEI
n
) is assigned a 
search key (KEY
1
 to KEY
p
; KEY) by an algorithm (ALG) in 
such a way that several equipment numbers (MEI
1
 to 
MEI
n
) correspond in each case with a search key (KEY
1
 
to KEY
p
; KEY), and that the search key (KEY
1
 to KEY
p
; 
KEY) at the same time covers a number of different 

structural elements (S
1
 to S
q
; DAT). 
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
a sort (KI) of structural elements assigns all 

equipment numbers (MEI
1
 to MEI
n
) that correspond with a 
search key (KEY
1
 to KEY
p
; KEY) to an equipment list 
(B, G, W). 
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
a sort (BI) of structural elements (S
1
 to S
q
; DAT) 
assigns an entire block of consecutive equipment 

numbers (MEI
1
 to MEI
n
) to an equipment list (B, G, W). 
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
a sort (SI) of structural elements (S
1
 to S
q
; DAT) 
assigns a single equipment number (MEI
1
 to MEI
n
) to an 
equipment list (B, G, W).  

 
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
like structural elements (S
1
 to S
q
; DAT) covered by the 
same search key (KEY
1
 to KEY
p
; KEY) are combined in 
structures (L1, RNG, SL, LB) of a fixed length. 
Method according to claim 5,
characterized in that
 
if required, several like structures (L1, RNG, SL, LB) 

are linked with one another. 
Method according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the structural elements (S
1
 to S
q
; DAT) are assigned a 
time stamp indicating when the data record specified 

by it was last renewed. 
Apparatus for determining the assignment of a mobile 
station (ME
1
 to ME
n
) to equipment lists (B, G, W) each 
containing a number of equipment numbers (MEI
1
 to MEI
n
) 
that are uniquely assigned to mobile stations (ME
1
 to 
ME

with a memory device (MEM) and a controller (CONTR) 

that is designed to determine, on request, data about 
the assignment of a mobile station (ME

) to an 
equipment list (B, G, W),
characterized in that
 
the memory device (MEM) is designed as a memory device 

for different structural elements (S

that the controller (CONTR) is provided with a 

converting device (GEN) for generating a search key 
(KEY
1
 to KEY
p
; KEY) from an equipment number (MEI
1
 to 
MEI
n
), with a comparator (COMP) for determining the 
affiliation of an equipment number (MEI
1
 to MEI
n
) to a 
structural element (S

 to S
q
; DAT), and with an access 
device (ACC) for reading different structural elements 

(S

 to S
q
; DAT) from the memory device (MEM), which  
 

access device is designed so that it accesses the 
structural elements (S
