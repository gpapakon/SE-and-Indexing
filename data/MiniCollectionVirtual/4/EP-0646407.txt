<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vortex mixers. Vortex mixers are devices which include a 
cylindrical mixing chamber having an axial outlet and a 
plurality of inlets so arranged that a vortex is set up 
in the mixing chamber when fluid is admitted to the 
mixing chamber via the inlets. The arrangement may be 
such that two or more liquid reagents can be admitted to 
the chamber, or a single reagent or additive can be added 
to a main liquid flowing through the mixer. The liquid leaving the vortex mixer does so in the 
form of a vortex. As a result, there is a degree of 
reverse flow along the inside of the vortex. This 
reverse flow can extend for a distance equal to several 
tens of the diameter of the exit pipe from the mixing 
chamber. When it is considered advantageous to operate vortex 
mixers under plug flow conditions, such as when it is 
desired to control competing chemical reactions, this 
phenomenon has an undesirable effect. According to the present invention there is provided 
a method of mixing fluids by means of a vortex mixer as 
hereinbefore defined, wherein there is included the 
operation of minimising reverse flow in the mixed fluid 
issuing from the vortex mixer. Also according to the invention there is provided an 
apparatus for mixing fluids, comprising a vortex mixer as 
hereinbefore defined, wherein there is included means for 
minimising reverse flow in mixed fluids issuing from the 
vortex mixer.  The outlet from the mixing chamber preferably has an 
axially extending portion the diameter of which is 
greater than a third of that of the mixing chamber of the 
vortex mixer. There may also be provided a radial diffuser such as 
to induce a radial component in the flow of the fluid 
issuing from the mixing chamber of the vortex mixer. The 
radial diffuser may comprise a baffle at right angles to 
the flow of the mixed fluid issuing from the mixing 
chamber of the vortex. Another form of radial diffuser which can be used is 
a plate having an axial inlet and at least one radially 
extending channel formed in it. Alternatively the axially extending portion of the 
outlet from the mixing chamber of the vortex mixer can 
have a form such that the diameter of the axially 
extending portion of the outlet from the mixing chamber 
of the vortex mixer increases in the direction of flow of 
the mixed fluid issuing from the mixing chamber of the 
vortex mixer. The invention will now be described, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which,
