<ABSTRACT>
A device for mounting a fuel feeding unit (12) inside a fuel tank, in particular of motor vehicles, is disclosed. The fuel feeding unit (12) is completely surrounded by dampening means (14) linked to a holder (13). The dampening means (14) completely uncouple the fuel feeding unit (12) from the holder (13). The device (11) can be mounted in the fuel tank by means of the holder (13).

<CLAIMS>
Device for mounting a fuel feed unit inside a
fuel tank, in particular of motor vehicles, having at

least one damping element (14) which substantially
completely surrounds the fuel feed unit (12) and is

arranged in the fuel tank by means of a holding device
(13) which engages on the damping element (14),

characterized in that the damping element (14) is
designed as a foamed body which surrounds at least the

fuel feed unit (12) in a form-fitting manner.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the damping element (14) is designed as an open-cell

foamed body.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the damping element (14)

is of two-part or multipart design and has cutouts in
order to mount the fuel feed unit (12) and/or the

electrical connection lines (17) and/or at least for a
connection piece (18) of an inflow line (19) and/or a

preliminary screen (16) of the fuel feed unit (12).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the two-part or multipart damping element (14) has

a parting plane (32) which runs axially with respect to
a longitudinal axis of the fuel feed unit (12).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the two-part or multipart damping

element (14) has a parting plane (37) which runs
radially with respect to a longitudinal axis of the

fuel feed unit (12). 
Device according to one of Claims 3 to 5,
characterized in that the two-part or multipart damping

element (14) has latching elements (36) which lie in
the parting plane (32, 37).
Device according to one the preceding claims,
characterized in that the holding device (13) is

arranged on at least one end side (22) of the damping
element (14), which is of substantially cylindrical

design, and has at least one attachment element (24)
for attaching it in the fuel tank.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the holding device (13)

has at least one electrical connection point (26), a
connection stop (27) which can be connected to the

inflow line (19), and a collar (31) which at least
partially engages around the damping element (14).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at an end of the damping

element (14) which is opposite to the holding device
(13) there is a sleeve (38) which extends at least in

part from an end side (41) which is opposite to the
holding device (13) towards the holding device (13).
