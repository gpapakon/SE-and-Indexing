<CLAIMS>
Pharmaceutical composition for non-topical wound,
scar and keloid treatment containing cross-linked

glycosaminoglycans and conventional pharmaceutical
auxiliary and/or carrier substances.
Composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
cross-linked glycosaminoglycans are glycosaminoglycans

cross-linked by chemical cross-linking,
chelate formation, complex formation and/or salt

formation.
Composition as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein it
contains a chemically cross-linked

glycosaminoglycan.
Composition as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein it contains gel formers, agents to set the

pH value, stabilizers, antioxidants, solubilizers,
agents that promote penetration and/or

preservatives.
Composition as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4,
wherein it is present as a gel.
Composition as claimed in claim 5, wherein it is
present as an injectable gel.
Composition as claimed in claim 5 or 6, wherein the
water content of the gel is 80 to 99 % by weight. 
Composition as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 7,
wherein it contains the cross-linked glycosaminoglycan

in an amount of 0.1 to 20 % by weight.
Composition as claimed in claim 8, wherein it
contains the cross-linked glycosaminoglycan in an

amount of 0.5 to 10 % by weight, in particular in
an amount of 1 to 5 % by weight.
Composition as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 9,
wherein a cross-linked glycosaminoglycan based on

one glycosaminoglycan or on two or several
different glycosaminoglycans is used as the cross-linked

glycosaminoglycan.
Composition as claimed in claim 10, wherein natural
or synthetic glycosaminoglycans and/or substances

that are chemically related thereto are used.
Composition as claimed in claim 11, wherein
glycosaminoglycans that occur in human connective

tissue are used as the natural glycosaminoglycans.
Composition as claimed in claim 11 or 12, wherein
hyaluronic acid, heparin, heparin sulfate and/or

chondroitin sulfate are used as the
glycosaminoglycan.
Composition as claimed in claim 11, wherein
sulfated polysaccharides are used as synthetic

glycosaminoglycans. 
Composition as claimed in claim 11, wherein
substances of biological origin and in particular

chitosamine and chitosan are used as the chemically
related substances.
Process for the production of a composition as
claimed in one of the claims 1 to 15, wherein the

cross-linked glycosaminoglycan and the other
components are dissolved in the physical carrier,

preferably in water, if desired, while heating and
subsequently cooling.
Use of a cross-linked glycosaminoglycan for the
production of a pharmaceutical composition for

wound, scar and keloid treatment.
Use as claimed in claim 17, wherein a
glycosaminoglycan as claimed in one of the claims

2, 3 and 10 to 15 is used as the cross-linked
glycosaminoglycan.
Use as claimed in claim 17 or 18 for the production
of a pharmaceutical composition that can be applied

intralesionally to inhibit scar and keloid
formation.
