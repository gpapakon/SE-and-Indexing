<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the hydroisomerization of
long chain n-paraffins having more than 15 carbon
atoms using a difunctional
catalyst constituted by a boro-silicate or a boro-alumino-silicate
isostructural with beta-zeolite and
one or more metal(s) belonging to Group VIIIA.The process of wax isomerization to yield base
stocks for lubricant oils characterized by a low pour
point and a high viscosity index requires the use of
suitable catalysts.In fact, waxes, mainly constituted (>80% by
weight) by n-paraffins having more than 15 carbon
atoms, which are solid at room temperature, must be
converted into their corresponding branched isomers,
having lower melting point than the linear isomer.In fact, n-C16 paraffins has a melting point of
19°C, whilst its 5-methyl-pentadecane isomer melts at
-31°C.However, an effective hydroisomerization catalyst
should minimize the possible cracking and
hydrocracking reactions, which are catalyzed by the
same acidic sites and have, as intermediates, the sane
carbocations which are useful for hydroisomerization.
These secondary reactions cause the degradation of the
molecule with lighter, less valuable, products being
formed, which must be removed from the end product
because they increase the volatility thereof; this 
requirement obviously constitutes a burden for the
overall process.For this process, difunctional catalysts have
been developed, i.e., catalysts which display both
acidic sites and hydro-dehydrogenation active sites.
The acidity of the catalyst depends on the selected
type of amorphous or crystalline carrier for it, and
the function thereof precisely is the isomerizing
activity.The hydro-dehydrogenating activity is given to
the catalyst by the deposited metal phase, the
function of which is also of minimizing cracking.It was demonstrated (J.F. Le Page, Applied
Heterogeneous Catalysis, Ed. Technip, Paris, 1987,
435-466) that, with the hydrogenating activity being
the same, the most selective catalysts are those in
which the carrier has a controlled acidity, so as to
maximize n-paraffin isomerization, relatively to
cracking. However, inasmuch as the cracking reactions
follow the isomerization reactions, the maximal
isomerization selectivity is obtained at low
conversion levels (G. Froment et al., Ind. Eng. Chem.
Prod. Res. Dev., 1981, 20, 654-660). In general, the
wax conversion rates are limited to values of 20-40%
by weight, in order to minimize the formation of light
products caused by the cracking reactions.The effectiveness of
