<ABSTRACT>
Programming a VCR to record a program which will be broadcast later, so called 
Time Shift Recording, has always been one of the most difficult tasks to be performed 

by a user. Different User Interface techniques have been employed in the 
past which are not perfect. Techniques like VPS marking or VIDEO +, seem to help 

greatly the user. But none of these approaches takes into account the user's way 
of thinking.

 
The normal users would like to be able to program the
ir VCR by impulse choice 
when viewing advertisements for a show they would like to record. The present 

invention proposes a way to realise such impulse programming for time shift recording. 
Program related data contained in the broadcast signal are evaluated (22, 

29) and compared with the current TV set tuning when a LEARN button on a remote 
control is pressed. The VCR tunes (20) to the present TV channel and stores 

the interesting program data. The invention proposes also some features ensuring 
the user that his recorded program will start and end at the right time and skip out 

every advertisements which will be broadcast during the recorded program.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for programming a
recording device and to a programming device.Programming a VCR to record a program which will be
broadcast later, so called Time Shift Recording, has always
been one of the most difficult tasks to be performed by a
user. Different User Interface techniques have been employed
in the past which are not perfect. Some interesting
techniques simplifying the entry method, such has VPS
marking or VIDEO+, seem to help greatly the user. But none
of these approaches takes into account the user's way of
thinking.From the document "Specification of the domestic video
Programme Delivery Control system (PDC)", European
Broadcasting Union, August 1990 it is known to programme a
video recorder by selecting a programme from the teletext
programme guide pages of a TV programme. A detailed
description of the preselection function for recording
control and the recording control function itself is given.It is one object of the invention to disclose a method of
programming a recording device which offers a very easy and
natural way to perform the normally complicated programming
task. This object is reached by the method disclosed in
claim 1.It is a further object of the invention to disclose a
programming unit which utilises the inventive method. This
object is reached by the apparatus disclosed in claim 10. A recent study of usage of home devices has enlightened the
fact, that some users would like to be able to program their
VCR by impulse choice when viewing advertisements for a show
they would like to record.The present invention proposes a way to realise such impulse
programming for time shift recording. Program related data
contained in the broadcast signal are evaluated and compared
with the current TV set tuning when a LEARN button on a
remote control is pressed. The VCR tunes to the present TV
channel and stores the interesting program data. The
invention proposes also some features ensuring the user that
his recorded program will start and end at the right time
and skip out every advertisements which will be broadcast
during the recorded program.In principle the inventive method consists in programming a
recording device, whereby data which are related to the
status and to the time and to the date and to the identity
and to the channel or frequency of the broadcast of a
desired program are transmitted accompanying to a present
program, and wherein:
normally all of said data describe said present program;if in a short time - especially in a few minutes - a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Method for programming a recording device (17),

wherein
 data, which are related to the
status (TYPE) and to the time (START TIME, DURATION) and

to the date (DATE) and to the identity (PROGRAM ID) and
to the channel or frequency (CHANNEL) of the broadcast

of a desired program, are transmitted (14) accompanying
a present program, wherein:


normally all of said data (TYPE, START TIME, DURATION,
DATE, PROGRAM ID, CHANNEL) describe said present

program;
if in a short time - especially in a few minutes - a new
program will be broadcast on the current channel or

frequency, said status data (TYPE) are set to a wait
status (WAIT) and the other of said data (START TIME,

DURATION, DATE, PROGRAM ID, CHANNEL) describe said new
program;
if there is is broadcast in the present program an
advertisement for a future program to be broadcast on

this channel/frequency or on another one, said status
data (TYPE) are set to an information status

(INFORMATION) and the other of said data (START TIME,
DURATION, DATE, PROGRAM ID, CHANNEL) describe said

advertised future program,

and wherein, when a user indicates that he wants to
record said desired new or future program, said data

(TYPE, START TIME, DURATION, DATE, PROGRAM ID, CHANNEL)
are extracted (22) from said present program and are

stored (25) and used to automatically program said
recording device, wherein before - especially a few

minutes before - the start time of the broadcast of said
desired program at said date said recording device is

tuned to the respective channel or frequency, if
necessary, and said recording device waits until said

status changes from said wait status (WAIT) to a

broadcast status (BROADCAST) and then starts recording, 
if said identity data (PROGRAM ID) match the respective

stored identity data.
Method according to claim 1, 
wherein
 in case that during
said present program some advertisements are broadcast

which are not related to a desired program, said status
data (TYPE) are set to a pause status (PAUSE) and the

other of said data (START TIME, DURATION, DATE, PROGRAM
ID, CHANNEL) describe the temporarily interrupted

present program, wherein the recording (17) is
interrupted until said status data (TYPE) are set to

said broadcast status (BROADCAST).
