<ABSTRACT>
A device for cutting off wrapping strings or bands (4) on wrapped articles, such as bales of pulp (1), comprises a cutting-edge holder (15) which, from a first inoperative position located outside the boundary surfaces of the wrapped article (1), can be projected along a path of movement towards the article to a second position in which the cutting edge is located at least in the same plane as one of the boundary surfaces of the article. The device further comprises a sensor (19) for sensing, while the article is moving in the longitudinal direction in relation to the device, the position of a separate wrapping string (4) and causing the cutting-edge holder (15) to project towards the article in order to cut off the wrapping string when this crosses the path of movement of the cutting-edge holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE FOR CUTTING OFF WRAPPING STRINGS ON WRAPPEDARTICLESBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to a device for cutting off wrapping strings or bands on wrapped articles, such as bales of pulp, comprising a cutting-edge holder which, from a first inoperative position located outside a bound¬ ary surface of a separate article, can be projected at high speed towards said article to a second position in which the cutting edge is located at least in the same plane as the boundary surface of the article while cutting off a separate wrapping string on the article.Devices for cutting off wrapping strings on wrapped articles are known in the art. SE 465,459, for instance, teaches a cutting device comprising a foot member and a toothed wheel which are arranged on a movable arm and adapted to be applied against a boundary surface of the article passing by on a conveyor. The toothed wheel serves to seize a separate wrapping string and lift it onto the upper side of the foot member to remove the string some¬ what from the article and enable it to be cut off. Cutting can be performed e.g. between a shearing means and an abutment. One drawback of this cutting device is that the foot member and the toothed wheel have to be applied, and trail and rotate, respectively, against the outside of the pass¬ ing article. As a rule, this does not involve any incon- veniencies when the outside of the article is smooth. How- ever, some articles, e.g. bales of pulp, are usually wrapped in paper which is often torn or folded. As a result, the paper often catches on the foot member, caus¬ ing a stoppage. Further, the bale itself may be damaged, with parts of the paper sheets projecting beyond the normal boundary surface of the bale, thereby making it impossible for the toothed wheel and the foot member to intercept the string. Should the cutting operation fail 

for some reason or other, e.g. because the wrapping paper has got stuck, the bale may catch in the foot member, thereby damaging the equipment.Furthermore, SE 394,096 discloses a device for sever- ing the wrapping strings on bales of pulp with the aid of impact means. Each such means is supported on the end of a pivot arm which can be pivoted towards and away from a lateral surface of the bale. To ensure that all the wrapping strings on the bale are cut off, a plurality of impact means do, however, have to be arranged and be simultaneously swung at high speed towards the stationary bale, the impacts being evenly distributed over the whole lateral

 CLAIMS
1. A device for cutting off wrapping strings or bands on wrapped articles, such as bales of pulp (1), comprising a cutting-edge holder (15) which, from a first inoperative position located outside a boundary surface of a separate article, can be projected at high speed towards said article to a second position in which the cutting edge is located at least in the same plane as the boundary surface of the article while cutting off a separate wrapping string on the article, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the cutting-edge holder (15) is located beneath the article, more precisely between two endless conveyor elements or chains (6), so that the wrapping string (4), when cut off, will be retained in position by being squeezed between the article and each of the conveyor chains, and that the device has a sensor (19) for sensing, while the article is moving in the longitudinal direction in relation to the device, the position of a separate wrapping string (4) and causing the cutting-edge holder (15) to project towards the article in order to cut off the wrapping string when this crosses the path of movement of the cutting-edge holder.
2. A device as set forth in claim 1, c h a r a c - t e r i s e d in that it is located beneath a plane of conveyance (17) of the wrapped articles (1) .
3. A device as set forth in claim 1 or 2, c h a ¬ r a c t e r i s e d in that the path of movement of the cutting-edge holder (15) is linear. 4. A device as set forth in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the cutting- edge holder (15) has a linear cutting edge (18) extending in parallel with the direction of movement of the articles
(1). 5. A device as set forth in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the sensor (19) is located in front of the cutting-edge holder (15), 


as seen in the direction of movement of the articles (1), the cutting-edge holder (15) being projected with delay after the sensor has sensed the presence of a wrapping string (4). 6. A device as set forth in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the sensor (19) is an inductive sensor for sensing metallic wrapping strings (4) .
7. A device as set forth in any one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that it comprises a blocking means (20, 21, 23) which has to be activated to enable the projection of the cutting-edge holder (15).
8. A device as set forth in claim 7, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i s e d in that the blocking means comprises two rotatable, spaced-apart wheels (20) which have concentric axes of rotation and which are resiliently applied against the article (1).
9. A device as set forth in claim 8, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i s e d in that the sensor (19) is located in the area between the wheels (20).
10. A device as set forth in claim 8 or 9, c h a ¬ r a c t e r i s e d in that the path of movement of the cutting-edge holder (15) extends through the space between the wheels (20).
