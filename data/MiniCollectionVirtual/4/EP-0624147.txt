<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
dispensing beverages, and more particularly, but not by 
way of limitation, to improvements on such a device for 
increasing its drink serving capacity while maintaining 
or-reducing the space occupied and insuring that the 
beverages dispensed are adequately cooled. In typical locations where beverages are dispensed, 
such as in cafeterias and snack bars, the value of 
counterspace is at a premium. Counterspace in a food 
serving line is very expensive, especially in larger 
metropolitan areas. For that reason, beverage 
dispensing machines are desirably small and compact. Additionally, it is critical for beverage 
dispensers to adequately cool dispensed beverages 
despite frequent use of the dispenser over extended 
periods of time. One of the most successful methods for 
accomplishing this objective is to provide a machine 
which, during periods of non-use, forms an ice bank 
which slowly melts while cooling the beverages during 
periods of frequent use. To provide a heat pumping unit 
which could adequately cool beverages without such an 
ice bank would put unfeasible power requirements on the 
unit; the necessary unit would be expensive and 
oversized.  
 Typical beverage dispensers employ evaporator coils 
as part of an electric refrigeration system which forms 
an ice bank from water placed in a tank. The beverage 
lines in such a unit are also submerged within the tank 
to enable cooling of the beverages before dispensing. 
The water is cooled by ice forming on the evaporator 
coils, and the cooled water is circulated about the 
beverage lines by an impeller or other circulating means 
to cool the beverages to a desired temperature. The ability of such beverage dispensers to 
adequately cool during extended period of frequent use 
depends significantly upon the size and orientation of 
the ice bank relative to the beverage lines. In fact, 
since larger ice banks ordinarily take longer amounts of 
time to melt, the volume of the ice bank formed in such 
a dispenser is a primary consideration for rating the 
dispenser. Those factors combined with the degree of 
insulation provided, the effectiveness of the cooling 
unit, and the manner of circulation within the cooling 
tank usually determine the dispenser's ability to 
adequately operate. To optimize each of those factors 
while minimizing space is the primary challenge in the 
technology of beverage dispensers. Beverage dispensers of this type are also rated by 
the number of drinks that can be

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for preventing excessive ice buildup in 
a beverage dispenser (10) containing liquid conduit 

lines (14), comprising: 

a fluid-filled receptacle (12) defining a 
cooling chamber; 
means (18) forming a solid slab (21) of frozen 
material from said fluid inside said cooling chamber; 

and 
insulation means (19a,19b) creating at least one 
fluid filled channel (22a,22b) defined partially by 

said insulation means (19a,19b), partially by said 
slab (21) of frozen material, and partially by a wall 

surface of said cooling chamber (12) wherein said 
fluid-filled channel (22a,22b) allows fluid to 

circulate from underneath said insulation means 
(19a,19b), through said fluid-filled channel 

(22a,22b), and over the top of said insulation means 
(19a,19b) thereby allowing fluid circulation about 

said slab (21) of frozen material. 
The apparatus according to claim 1 further comprising 
a means (20) to circulate unfrozen fluid through said 

channel (22a,22b) and about said slab (21) and said 
liquid conduit lines (14) to enable the transfer of 

heat. 
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
means forming said slab of frozen material comprises 

evaporator coils (15) disposed in said cooling 
chamber (12) for freezing said fluid around said 

evaporator coils. 
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said 
insulation means creating at least one fluid-filled 

channel comprises at least one insulator pad 

(19a,19b) affixed to said evaporator coils (18). 
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said 
circulation means comprises an impeller (20).  

 
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said 
liquid conduit lines comprise product lines (14).
