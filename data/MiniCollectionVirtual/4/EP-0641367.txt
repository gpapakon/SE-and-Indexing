<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYMER COMPOSITIONThe present invention relates to scratch-resistant polymer compositions and moulded articles.Plastics materials are utilised in a wide variety of applications, many of which require the material to maintain its aesthetic appeal notwithstanding various scratches and scuffs to which it is subjected during its useful life. Plastics materials are particularly susceptible to degradation of surface finish and the subsequent loss of aesthetic appeal. In particular, opaque plastics materials show a far greater loss of aesthetic appeal than either transparent or translucent plastics materials. It is believed that micro-tearing and stress whitening of the plastics material occurs around any scratches in the surface of the plastics material. This damage is far more visible, and hence much more of a problem, in opaque plastics materials.Opaque plastics materials find considerable use in applications which require a resistance to scratches and scuffs. For example car manufacturers utilise coloured plastics materials (typically polypropylene) for the interior trim of their vehicles. The interior trim of a car is subjected to considerable scratching and scuffing. Accordingly there is a need for a plastics material which may be pigmented as desired but is able to resist the scratches and scuffs of everyday use. There are a considerable number of other applications where scratch resistance is required in opaque materials. 'We have now found an opaque plastics material which provides a surface finish with improved scratch-resistance and alleviates some of the abovementioned problems. Accordingly we therefore provide an opaque polymer composition comprising a blend of: 

 a matrix polymer selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, high density polyethylene and poly- 4-methylpentene -1; at least one impact modifier wherein said impact modifier is a copolymer or terpolymer of ethylene and at least one other α-olefin or diolefin; at least one opacifier selected from the group consisting of colourants and fillers and combinations thereof; and at least one block copolymer of at least one styrenic monomer and at least one olefinic or diolefinic monomer. In practice, we have found that polymer compositions of the present invention comprising polypropylene as matrix polymer exhibits particularly marked resistance to damage associated with scratching. Wherein polypropylene is utilised as matrix polymer we have found that it is preferable that the polypropylene be selected from is isotactic
