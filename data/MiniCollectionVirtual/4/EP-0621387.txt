A device for gas exchange in multi-pane insulating 
glass units having sealant spacers (7), consisting of a 

tubular tool, which is provided with a handle region 
(2) at one end on which a connection piece (3) for a 

device for gas exchange is located, characterised in 
that the tool is sharpened at its other end (1) like a 

plug drill and that openings (4) are provided in the 

wall of the tool in the part located between the 
sharpened end (1) and the handle region (2). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that no openings (4) are provided in the wall of the 

tool in a region which corresponds approximately to the 
thickness of the sealant (7), at the sharpened end (1) 

and before the handle region (2). 
A device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the openings (4) in the wall of 

the tool are bores at right-angles to the tube axis, 
which are each offset by 90Â° relative to each other. 
A device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that two opposing stubs (5) are arranged on the 

handle region (2). 
A device according to Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the outer tube diameter of the tubular tool is 

approximately half the distance between the panes (10). 
A method for using the device according to Claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that at least one device is 

introduced through the sealant (7) into the gap (6) 
between the panes at at least one point, then the gas 

exchange is effected and then the gap (6) between the  
 

panes is sealed again by withdrawing the device and 
simultaneously inserting the drill core (8) into the 

drilled passage (9).
