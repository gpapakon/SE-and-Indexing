<ABSTRACT>
Device in the entry area of a double-deck railway coach with lower deck and upper deck, which device has on each side of the coach entry doors which permit access to an entry space (2), with a compartment door (6) for the lower-deck passenger space and access stairs (4) to the upper deck. An entry space (2) behind the entry doors (5) has the entire inner spatial height of a double-deck railway coach (1) and is crossed in the longitudinal direction of the coach by a web (3) which runs at the height of the upper deck. Stairs (4) which take up half the width of the coach lead to the upper deck (7). Corner-shaped recesses in the longitudinal direction of the coach increase the entry space (2). The side wall balustrades of the web (3) can be constructed as information displays and/or advertising panels, if required as back-lit transparent advertising. The entry height to the entry space (2) is greater than the spatial height of the lower deck. Upper-deck coach windows in the area of the entry space (2) allow additional daylight to enter. In a further variant, two sets of access stairs (4) located diagonally opposite one another are present and the web (3) which crosses the entry space (2) extends diagonally with respect to the longitudinal axis of the coach. In addition, the entry door (5) can have two door wings which are of different widths and can be actuated separately.

<CLAIMS>
Equipment in the entry region of a double-deck railway coach (1, 
1') with lower deck and upper deck, which coach on both sides displays 

entry doors (5, 5'), which enable the access to an entry space (2, 2'), 
with compartment door (6, 6') to the lower deck passenger space and 

ascending stairs (4, 4') to the upper deck, characterised thereby, that 
the entry space (2, 2') extends over the entire space height of both 

decks and that the entry space (2, 2') is spanned by a bridge-like web 
(3, 3') at about half the height of the coach. 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the web 
(3') is arranged diagonally to the longitudinal axis of the coach. 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the web 
(3, 3') traversing the entry space (2, 2') displays a U-shaped cross-section. 
Equipment according to claim 1 and 2, characterised thereby, that 
the web (3, 3') is connected by tie rods with the roof of the coach. 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
entry space (2, 2') displays at least one upper deck coach window. 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
entry height of an entry door (5, 5') is greater than the height of the 

lower deck space. 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the outward balustrade surfaces of the web (3, 3') 

display indicators for passenger information and/or side walls formed 
as promotional surfaces. 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that outward balustrade surfaces of the web (3, 3') are formed 

as transparent promotional surfaces illuminated from the rear.  
 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
entry space (2) displays angular bulges, which enlarge the base area 

and the space, in the longitudinal direction of the coach. 
Equipment according to claim 1 and 6, characterised thereby, that 
the entry door (5') displays two unequally wide door wings (5.1, 5.2), 

which are separately actuable and/or automatically controlled in 
dependence on passenger flow. 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a 
second rising staircase (4') to the upper deck is present and rises 

from the floor surface of the entry space (2').
