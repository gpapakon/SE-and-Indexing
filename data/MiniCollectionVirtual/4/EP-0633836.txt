<ABSTRACT>
A heating element for providing localized heating during the thermoplastic bonding of thermoset composite structures is disclosed. Various construction details are developed which disclose an apparatus and method for uniformly heating a bond line. In one embodiment, a heating element (22) includes a resistance heating material (24) sandwiched between two layers of electrical insulation (25) and encased within a layer of thermoplastic material (26). Low resistance electrical leads (28), which extend across the width of the resistance heating material, and a power supply (30) provide electrical energy to raise the temperature of the resistance heating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a Continuation-In-Part of prior co-pending patent application Serial 
No. 07/628,245, filed December 17, 1990, entitled "Bonding of Thermoset 
Composite Structures". This invention relates to heating means used in structural bonding, and 
more particularly to heating means used in thermoplastic bonding of thermoset 
composite structures. Thermoset composites have received widespread use in the aircraft 
industry as a structural material. This type of composite can provide a light 
weight structure of relatively high strength. To obtain a high strength structural 
bond with thermoset composites currently requires costly methods of bonding 
combined with mechanical fasteners. One method of bonding thermoset composite structures together is to place 
thermoset resin film adhesive material between the surfaces to be bonded, 
followed by applying heat and pressure to the joint zone. German Patent 
Document DE 3125393 A1 describes a method for interconnecting structural 
walls (2, 3) utilizing a double-sided adhesive tape (7) having two adhesive 
layers (9, 10) that are heat reactive. An electric heating element (14) may be 
disposed within the adhesive tape (7) between the adhesive layers (9, 10). This 
process is not very practical as it involves the application of relatively high heat, 
e.g., 394K - 450K (250 - 350°F) and pressure, e.g., 17.2 X 104 N/m2 (25 psi) 
minimum, for extended periods of time (2 hours minimum at temperature). 
Thermal expansion can become a problem when large areas of structure are 
heated as required for this process. This is due to differing rates of thermal 
expansion of localized which causes thermal strain when the structure is cooled 
and can cause deformations. Another drawback is that thermoset adhesives can 
only be processed once and the bond is not reversible for repair or replacement 
of subsequently damaged substructures. A second method currently used involves attaching together thermoset 
composite structures using mechanical fasteners combined with room 
temperature curing thermoset paste adhesive applied to joint surfaces. This  
 
method requires that the components being joined be pre-fitted and drilled for 
pilot holes, disassembled, cleaned, and bond prepared. Adhesive is then applied 
to joint surfaces, the components are then reassembled, and the adhesive cured 
(usually 24 hours at room temperature). The next step is to drill and ream holes 
for each fastener and finally the fasteners are installed. This method is costly 
due to the use of mechanical
