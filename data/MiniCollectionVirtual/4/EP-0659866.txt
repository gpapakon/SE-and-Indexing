<ABSTRACT>
A liquid-crystal panel comprises a pair of transparent 
glass substrates each being provided with an electrode. 

Between the glass substrates are disposed spacers for defining 
a space and a mixture of droplets of a liquid crystal having a 

mean diameter of 3.0 µm or less and of a photo-curing polymer. 
The edge portions of the glass substrates are sealed with a 

seal polymer. In curing the photo-curing polymer during the 
process of manufacturing the liquid-crystal panel, the dose of 

an ultraviolet ray is set to 500 mJ/cm² or more so as to reduce 
the diameters of the droplets of the liquid crystal, thereby 

preventing light leakage in the state without a voltage applied 
and improving the contrast. If the spacers are colored, the 

effect of preventing light leakage is increased. If the 
spacers are subjected to a surface treatment for rejecting the 

liquid crystal or composed of a polymer material of the same 
type as that of the photo-curing polymer, variations in 

diameter of the droplets of the liquid crystal can be 
prevented. With the structure, it becomes possible to provide 

a liquid-crystal panel in which light leakage in the black mode 
is reduced and which presents uniform and high-contrast display 

of images.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid-crystal panel for 
use in a liquid-crystal display apparatus, an optical shutter, 
or the like, to a method of manufacturing the same, and to a 
liquid-crystal display apparatus using the liquid-crystal 
panel. Liquid-crystal panels, which are small in size, light in 
weight, and operable with low power voltage, have a wide range 
of applications as means for displaying a variety of visually 
recognizable patterns. For example, such appliances as wrist 
watches, electronic tabletop calculators, personal computers, 
and personal word processors often use liquid-crystal panels 
therein for their further miniaturization and weight reduction. 
However, since a liquid-crystal panel of TN (twisted nematic) 
type or STN (supertwisted nematic) type currently used requires 
a polarizing plate, its light transmittance and long-term light 
resistance are unsatisfactory. By contrast, since a panel 
containing a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) does not 
require a polarizing plate, it is free from the above-mentioned 
drawbacks. FIGS. 5(a) and 5(b) are cross-sectional views showing the 
structure of a conventional liquid-crystal panel of polymer  
 
dispersed type. FIG. 5(a) shows the state without a voltage 
applied, while FIG. 5(b) shows the state with the voltage 
applied. As shown in FIGS. 5(a) and 5(b), the liquid-crystal 
panel is constituted by: a pair of glass substrates 1a and 1b 
having electrodes 2a and 2b, respectively, which are opposed to 
each other; and a mixture of a liquid crystal 4 and a photo-curing 
polymer 5 which is filled into the space between the 
both substrates 1a and 1b. It is also possible to use a 
thermosetting polymer instead of the photo-curing polymer 5, 
provided that it contains a crosslinkage-type polymer as its 
main component. In a liquid-crystal panel of polymer dispersed type as 
described above, the liquid-crystal 4 is dispersed and held in 
the photo-curing polymer 5 or the photo-curing polymer 5 exists 
in particles or in network in the liquid crystal 4. If a 
voltage is not applied to the space between the electrodes 2a 
and 2b, liquid-crystal molecules are randomly oriented so that 
a difference in refractive index is caused between the photo-curing 
polymer 5 and the liquid crystal 4, thereby scattering 
light (see FIG. 5(a)). On the other hand, if the voltage is 
applied to the space between the electrodes 2a and 2b, the 
liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in the direction of a 
resulting electric field so that there
