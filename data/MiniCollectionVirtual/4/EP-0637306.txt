<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a new class of
serotonin antagonists, their use in the treatment of a
number of disease states, and to pharmaceutical
compositions containing them.In accordance with the present invention, a new class
of serotonin 5HT2 antagonists have been discovered that can
be represented by the following formula:

in which R is represented by hydrogen, halogen, C1-4 alkyl,
C1-4 alkoxy, -CF3, -OH, or -OCF3; and A is represented by
one of the following imide derivatives: 

in which R1 and R2 are each independently represented by
hydrogen, halogen, C1-4 alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy, -CF3, -OH, or
-OCF3; and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Since the compounds of Formula I are serotonin 5HT2
antagonists, they are effective in the treatment of a
number of disease states. These disease states include
anxiety, angina, anorexia nervosa, Raynaud's phenomenon,
intermittent claudication, coronary or peripheral 
vasospasms, fibromyalgia, psychosis, drug abuse, thrombotic
illness, glaucoma and in controlling the extrapyramidal
symptoms associated with neuroleptic therapy.As used in this application:
a) the term "halogen" refers to a fluorine, chlorine, or
bromine atom;b) the term "C1-4 alkyl" refers to a branched or straight
chained alkyl group containing from 1-4 carbon atoms, such
as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl,
etc.;c) the term "C1-4 alkoxy" refers to a straight or branched
alkoxy group containing from 1-4 carbon atoms, such as
methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy,
etc;d) the term "C(O)" refers to a carbonyl group.Some of the compounds of Formula I will exist as
pharmaceutically acceptable basic additions salts. The
expression "pharmaceutically acceptable basic addition
salts" is intended to apply to any non-toxic organic or
inorganic basic addition salts of the compounds represented
by Formula I or any of its intermediates. Illustrative
bases which form suitable salts include alkali metal or
alkaline-earth metal hydroxides such as sodium, potassium,
calcium, magnesium, or barium hydroxides; ammonia, and
aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic organic amines such as
methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and picoline.Some of the compounds of Formula I will exist as
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. The 
expression "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition
salts" is intended to apply to any non-toxic organic or
inorganic acid addition salt of the base compounds
represented by Formula I or any of its intermediates.
