<ABSTRACT>
A process for providing hermetically sealed electrical connectors is provided. 
This process is applicable to both new parts and existing connectors which need to be 

reworked due to the development of a leak. The process utilizes a plastic connector 
housing which provides the advantages of low cost and easy moldability or 

machineability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hermetically sealed electrical connector used
to pass electrical signals from the interior to the exterior of a hermetically sealed
container. A process is disclosed to achieve a robust, hermetically sealed connector.Reference is made to GB-A-2 257 579. This document discloses a method of
sealing an electrical conductor with the features according to the preamble of claim 1.
Further reference is made to US-A-3,770,878.In certain environments, it is necessary to isolate electrical equipment from the
outside world. In many applications this is accomplished by placing the necessary
elements within some type of canister or container, and then hermetically sealing the
container to avoid any environmental contamination such as humidity and undesired
gases.When using hermetically sealed canisters, it is typically necessary to pass
electrical signals from the exterior of these canisters to the interior. These electrical
signals may be power supplies, control signals, or readout signals. In order to maintain
the integrity of the hermetic seal around such a canister. it is necessary that the
connectors, or devices for passing electrical signals from the exterior to the interior,
maintain the integrity of the hermetic seal.Many materials can be used to fabricate the necessary connectors, such as
metals, machineable plastics, or moldable plastics. An example of a machineable, or
moldable, plastic used for fabricating connectors is RytonÂ®.The problem with many machined plastic connectors is their inability to
maintain the integrity of their hermetic seal. For example, many connectors begin to
leak aftcr they have been temperature-cycled for a period of time. Once the seal begins
to leak, many problems are created since this destroys the entire reason for hermetically
sealing a container.Many of the aforementioned leaks result from inadequate sealing techniqucs.
The use of incorrect sealants. or potting materials, results in unnecessary stresses in the
connector due to filler settling. Filler matcrial placed in the sealant rcsults in a
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) differential within the cured scalant itself. If the 
filler material settles in the sealant (the filler migrates to one area within sealant), the
CTE differential creates a much larger problem due to the possibility of increased
thermal expansion. This CTE differential, in conjunction with any inherent CTE
differential within the plastic connector, causes stresses during thermal cycling resulting
in leaks.

<CLAIMS>
A method of sealing an electrical connector having a connector housing (10, 90)
made of a plastic, comprising the steps of:


positioning a connector pin (20) within the sealing cavity such that the connector
pin extends through a lower surface (19, 96) of the sealing cavity;
potting the sealing cavity and connector pin with a sealant (30); and
curing the sealant at a predefined temperature for a predetermined period of time,
characterized by
 the following steps:

abrading the connector (10, 90) so a sealing cavity (16, 94) of the connector has an
abraded surface;
cleaning the sealing cavity so as to remove any abrading residue;
whereby the connector (10, 90) is abraded and cleaned before it is potted;
curing the sealant at a second predefined temperature for a second period of timc,
the second predefined temperature being higher than the first predefined

temperature.
The method of claim 1 for sealing electrical connectors wherein the conectors are
found to have leaks, the method comprising the steps of removing existing material

from the sealing cavity (16, 94) of the connector housing before abrading the
connector.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the step of abrading the connector is
accomplished by spraying the sealing cavity with an abrasivc material.
The method of claim 2 or 3 wherein the step of removing all resisting material from
the sealing cavity comprises chemically dissolving any existing material therein.
The method of claim 3 wherein the abrasive material is alumina.
The method of one of the preceding claims wherein the stcp of cleaning thc sealant
cavity includes the stcps of:


chemically cleaning the sealing cavity; and 
baking the connector.
The method of one of the preceding claims wherein the sealant is a high
temperature resistant sealing compound with high lap shear adhesion properties and

uniform coefficient of thermal expansion CTE throughout.
The method of claim 7 wherein the sealant is Scotchweld 2214.
The method of claim 7 wherein the sealant is Stycast 2850 FT with hardener
Catalyst 11.
