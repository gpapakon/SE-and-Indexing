<ABSTRACT>
To extend the field of use of previously known and particularly card-shaped small devices or instruments by means of a novel electronic function element (1), the latter comprises its own integrated power source, particularly power supply (4), a signal pick-up unit (5) and a microprocessor (3), connected to the latter and to a read-only memory (2), for picking up and analysing picked up signals or data by means of base and, particularly, identification data stored in the small device (1). This creates an active electronic function element or small device (1) which can pick up and analyse signals, compares these signals with a stored special code and, when the received signal and its own code correspond, correspondingly initates and effects processes.
