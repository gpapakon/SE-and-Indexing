<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a low-part-load and mechanically reliable fixing for a high-voltage winding which can also be easily manufactured. The winding is fixed in the region of its head with a glass-fibre tube (1) passing around each winding rod (2). The glass-fibre tube is surrounded by a woven glass or polyester structure. In order to obtain good mechanical strength the glass-fibre tubes (1) are filled with a resin. In order to prevent partial discharges in the interstices (4) formed by the glass-fibre tube (1) and the rod or winding insulation (3), the glass-fibre tube is coated with a semiconducting polymer. The purpose of the elastic polymer coating is to provide a seal when resin is injected into the woven glass tube. In addition, the entire potential distribution between the two conductors and coil or rod insulation is shifted in favour of the glass tube, thus preventing the ionisation of the interstices.

<CLAIMS>
High voltage winding of an electrical rotating machine, 
wherein the construction of the support of the winding head 

is realized continuous with at least a pipe (1) in glass 
fibers, is surrounded in continuous by mean of at least a 

glass fibers pipe (1), the glass fibers pipe (1) being 
surrounded by a structure woven in glass or in polyester and 

especially filled a resin having a wetting power to the 
ambient temperature, characterized in that the external 

surface of the glass fibers pipe (1) is provided of a layer 
of semi-conductive polymer (6) that allows an injection of 

the resin in the glass fibers pipe (1) of barrs upper or 
lower bars (2) placed one beside the other after winding. 
High voltage winding according to the claim 1, 
characterized in that the polymer layer (6) is a silicone 

layaer and contains silicon carbide as constituent. 
High voltage winding according to the claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the semi-conductive polymer layer (6) 

is subdivided to the periphery of the glass fibers pipe (1) 
by means of non-conductive sections (5).
