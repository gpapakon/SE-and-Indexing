<ABSTRACT>
A knee prosthesis includes plastic femoral and metallic (or 
ceramic) tibial components. The plastic femoral knee component 

articulates against a polished metal (e.g. cobalt alloy, titanium alloy, 
or stainless steel), or preferably ceramic (e.g. alumina, zirconia, 

nitride, or boride) patella and tibial components in a total knee 
implant. The polymer femoral material can be of a polymer such as 

ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, or a polymer blend or a fiber 
or particle reinforced polymer, or layered polymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical prosthetic devices 
and more particularly to an improved orthopedic knee implant that 
includes a polymeric femoral component, preferably of an ultra high 
molecular weight polymeric material that articulates against metallic 
(or ceramic or ceramic coated metal) patella and tibia components. About ten years ago, total knee arthroplasty became a popular 
and routinely accepted treatment for arthritic and other diseases of 
the knee. During this period of time and before, various combinations 
of articulating materials were tried with varying degrees of success. 
Polyacetyl type of polymeric material has been used for the femoral 
surface and articulating against another polymeric material (e.e. 
teflon) on the tibial surface. Polymer-polymer articulation has been 
tested but produced excessive wear. The most widely accepted 
combination used at present is a metal femoral surface articulating 
against polymer tibial and patella surfaces. As the nature of the complex knee joint articulation became 
better understood, the system most widely used today, a cobalt alloy 
femoral surface and an Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene 
(UHMWPE) tibial and patella surface became the standard. 
However, bioengineers, surgeons, and other scientists are still 
learning more about the performance of this knee system as sufficient 
numbers of patients are just now reaching more than ten years 
postop. In the past five years or so the medical community has come 
to appreciate the adverse effect of UHMWPE wear debris and its 
ability in sufficient volume to produce bone lysis and thus revision of 
the implant. The most prevalent source of UHMWPE wear debris results 
from relatively rapid (compared to the tibial surface) wear of the 
UHMWPE patella surface. If the patella has a metal backing, this 
backing can eventually wear against the metal femoral surface 
following excessive polyethylene wear, and further aggravate the 
wear process and accelerate the adverse consequences via 
production of metal and UHMWPE debris.  Tibial wear of the UHMWPE has also been observed. Thinner 
UHMWPE surfaces on the tibia may allow eventual wear through to 
the underlying metal. Thicker tibial UHMWPE surfaces are desired 
but at the expense of excessive resection of the bone (tibia) during 
surgery. In just the past few years, the benefit of ceramic-UHMWPE 
wear combinations in the total hip joint and in laboratory tests have 
shown this wear combination to reduce friction and UHMWPE wear.
