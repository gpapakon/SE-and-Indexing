<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a coiler furnace for a hot strip (5) having a furnace hood (1), a drivable coiler drum (2) provided in the furnace hood (1) and exhibiting an introduction opening (3) for the coil-up end (4) of the hot strip (5), and having a strip entry guide (6) opening out in a strip takeover position of the coiler drum (2) in the region of its introduction opening (3), the coiler drum (2), drivable in the sense in which the coil-up end enters the introduction opening, being adjustable as a function of the coil diameter in a guide (15) running transversely to the entering strip strand (13). To ensure that the hot strip is drawn fully into the coiler furnace, it is proposed that a strip run-off guide (19) reaches or is introduceable into the gap between the strip coil and the entering or departing strip strand (13 and 22, respectively).

A reel furnace for a hot strip (5), comprising
a hood (1), a drivable reel spindle (2) provided in

the hood (1) and having an opening (3) for inserting
the coiling end (4) of the hot strip (5) and also

comprising a strip inlet guide (6) terminating in
the region of the insertion opening (3) at a place

where the spindle (2) receives the strip, wherein
the spindle (2), which is drivable in the direction

in which the coiling end (4) enters the opening (3),
is adjustable in dependence on the coil diameter in

a guide (15) extending transversely of the incoming
strip run (13), 
characterised in that
 a strip
discharge guide (19) projects or is insertable into

the nip region between the coiled strip and the
incoming or outgoing strip run (13, 22) and that the

drive for adjusting the spindle (2) in the guide
(15) extending transversely of the incoming strip

run (13) comprises two separately actuated drive
units (16) each associated with one side of the reel

spindle.
A reel furnace according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 at least one non-displaceably
mounted back-up roller (12) is associated with the

spindle (2).
A reel furnace according to claim 2,

characterised in that
 the back-up roller (12)
comprises one roller out of a roller train extending

through the reel furnace underneath the spindle (2). 
A reel furnace according to any of claims 1 to
3, 
characterised in that
 a scale-collecting means
(18) projects into the nip region between the coiled

strip and the incoming or outgoing strip run (13,
22).
A reel furnace according to claim 4,

characterised in that
 the strip discharge guide (19)
is in the form of a scale-collecting means (18).
A reel furnace according to any of claims 1 to
5, 
characterised in that
 a strip discharge guide
(23) adjustable against the coiled strip and

followed by a pair of drive rollers (25) is provided
on the side of the furnace remote from the strip

inlet guide (6).
A reel furnace according to claim 6,

characterised in that
 the strip discharge guide (23)
is movable on the side of the furnace remote from

the strip inlet guide (6) between an operating
position adjusted against the coiled strip and an

inoperative position which closes a passage opening
for the strip through the hood (1).
A reel furnace according to claim 6 or 7,

characterised in that
 out of the pair (24) of drive
rollers the drive roller associated with the coiled

strip is a non-displaceably mounted back-up roller
(12).
