<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for welding a branch tube 
(20) to a header tube (15) includes a fixture (10) having a 

pair of clamps for supporting the fixture on the header 
tube. A welding head (25) on the fixture (10) includes a 

clamp (30) to hold the branch tube (20) in place relative to 
the header tube (15). The welding head (25) also includes a 

collet (55) extending into contact with the header tube 
(15). The header tube, the collet (55) and the welding head 

(25) form a limited volume chamber (100) that contains 
shielding gas in the vicinity of the joint (90) between the 

branch tube (20) and the header tube (15). The welding head 
(25) includes a mechanism (70,80) for rotating a tungsten 

welding electrode (85) around the intersection of the branch 
tube (20) and the header tube (15) to form the welded joint 

(90).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved T-Joint 
welding fixture. Welding of a branch tube or pipe to a header 
tube or pipe by the TIG welding process requires that a 
shielding gas be maintained around the joint during the 
process. In prior art devices, a large volume of air or 
gas surrounds the joint thus requiring considerable time 
to purge the air and insure that the shielding gas is 
sufficient to protect the weld joint before welding 
actually begins. The present invention relates to an improved 
welding fixture for use in welding a branch tube to a 
header tube. Specifically, the fixture includes a frame 
member that support the fixture on the header tube. This 
is preferably done by means of a pair of clamps carried 
on the frame member. These clamps are conventional and 
include collets for securing the frame to the header 
tubes of various sizes. The fixture also carries a 
welding head of the type shown in U.S. Patent 5,220,144 
which is incorporated by reference into the present 
application. That welding head includes a clamp for 
holding the branch tube in place relative to the header 
tube and said fixture, and further, it includes a collet 
extending from the weld head that is in contact or near 
contact with the header tube to provide a relatively gas 
tight seal. The weld head and the collet form a chamber 
that contains the shielding gas in the vicinity of the 
joint between the branch tube and the header tube. It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide an improved T-Joint welding fixture for use in 
welding a branch tube to a header tube, said fixture  
 
comprising a frame member for supporting said fixture to 
the header tube, a clamp on said frame member for holding 
the branch tube in place relative to the header tube and 
said fixture, and a collet extending from said fixture 
into contact with the header tube, said fixture, said 
collet and said clamp forming a chamber for containing 
shielding gas in the vicinity of the joint between the 
branch tube and the header tube. It is a further object of this invention to 
provide a method of welding a branch tube to a header 
tube comprising the steps of attaching a fixture to the 
header tube, holding the branch tube in place relative to 
the fixture and to the header tube by means of a clamp, 
forming a shielding gas chamber in the immediate vicinity 
of the joint between the header tube and the branch tube 
by means of a collet extending from the fixture into 
contact with the header tube surrounding the joint to be
