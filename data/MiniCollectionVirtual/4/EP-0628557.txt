<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biphenylmethane 
derivative and pharmacologically acceptable 
salts thereof which 
are useful as a therapeutic agent for hypertension 
and/or a therapeutic agent for cardiac failure. About 20% of the whole Japanese, i.e., about 
twenty million or more Japanese are suffering from 
hypertension, and the hypertension is a serious risk 
factor of various cerebral diseases or heart diseases. 
In practice, thiazide hypotensive diuretic  
 
agents, β-blockers, calcium antagonists, or ACE 
inhibitors have now been clinically utilized 
for drug therapy of the hypertension. However, the origin and pathology of the 
hypertension are very different, and it is difficult 
to significantly control all types of hypertension 
through the use of only one drug. Further, regarding 
safety, the β-blocker brings about cardiac depression 
and bronchial actuation as the side effects and the 
diuretic agent brings about side effects such as 
hyperuricemia, abnormal saccharometabolism and abnormal 
fat metabolism, while the ACE inhibitor brings about 
cough as the side effect. Under the above-described circumstances, different 
types of better hypotensives which exhibit their 
effects through various mechanisms have still been 
desired. The present inventors have made extensive and 
intensive studies on a compound having a nonpeptide 
angiotensin II antagonistic activity for years and, 
as a result, have found that the following 
biphenylmethane derivative has an excellent activity. Examples of the imidazole compound having an 
angiotensin II antagonistic activity proposed in 
the art include those disclosed in Japanese Patent  
 
Laid-Open Nos. 148788/1979, 71073/1981, 71074/1981, 
98270/1982, 157768/1983 and 23868/1988. Further, 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 240683/1987 proposes 
4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic 
acid derivatives. Any of the above-described 
compounds are different from the compounds 
of the present invention, which will be described 
hereinbelow, in the structure. EP-A-0 399 731, which is a document in accordance with 
Article 54(3) EPC, discloses specific biphenyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b] 
pyridine derivatives. EP-A-0 400 974, which is also a 
document in accordance with Art. 54(3) EPC, reveals 
substituted imidazo-fused 6-membered heterocycles which do not 
contain a cycloalkyl radical at position 2. EP-A-0 415 886 
(document according to Art. 54(3) EPC) discloses 
azabenzimidazol compounds, especially biphenyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 
derivatives.
