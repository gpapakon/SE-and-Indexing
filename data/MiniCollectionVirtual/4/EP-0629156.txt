<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held marking device comprises an electrically actuated writing head (20) for making marks on a writing surface and a sensor (40) for detecting when the writing head is moving in any direction in a plane parallel to the surface. The device includes means (57) for causing the head to be actuated when the sensor detects relative movement of the writing head and the surface. The writing head can be arranged to be able to make a plurality of different types or sizes of marks on a writing surface, in which case means (53-55) are provided for selecting which of the different mark types or sizes is to be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hand-held 
electronically-controlled drawing and writing instrument 
which provides electronic control of the width and pattern 
of the marks made by the device. More particularly it 
relates to such a device using ink jet technology to 
provide a writing instrument. There exist various writing instruments including 
ballpoint pens, fibre tip pens, pencils, fountain pens, 
etc., which allow lines to be drawn to form letters and 
images. If a different width of line is required, a 
different pen must be used. If the darkness of the line 
must be changed, a different pen or ink must be used. The 
user needs manual dexterity to create patterns, letters, or 
textures. In addition, conventional instruments rely on 
contact between the ink delivery device and the substrate 
for the transfer of ink to the substrate. Constraining the 
ink delivery device to touch the substrate compromises the 
number of features and level of performance. US-A-4 746 936 describes a pen using an ink jet nozzle 
to allow completely non-contact marking of surfaces, where 
the roughness or softness of the surface makes conventional 
contact marking difficult. Delivery of ink is controlled 
by a finger-operated switch mounted on the side of the pen. 
This tackles the problem of writing on difficult surfaces, 
but does not provide a means of producing high quality 
writing and drawings with the natural action of sliding a 
writing instrument over a surface. US-A-4168533 describes 
a miniature postage meter which incorporates an ink jet 
printing device adapted to print pre-defined postage 
indicia. The device is moved in a single direction in 
order that the postage indicia are properly produced. The present invention has been devised to overcome the 
drawbacks of existing marking instruments and to provide 
features and benefits that have not been possible using 
conventional techniques. According to the present invention there is provided 
a hand-held marking device comprising an elongate casing;  
 
an electrically actuated writing head for making marks on 
a writing surface; a sensor for detecting movement of the 
writing head in any direction in a plane parallel to the 
surface without rotation of the device about its 
longitudinal axis; and means for causing the head to be 
actuated to cause writing when the sensor detects said 
movement of the writing head relative to the surface. Preferably, the writing head is arranged to to make a 
plurality of different types or sizes of marks on a writing

<CLAIMS>
A hand-held writing device comprising 

an elongate casing (1); 
an electrically actuated writing head (18/20) for 
making marks on a writing surface; 
a sensor (4) for detecting movement of the writing 
head in any direction in a plane parallel to the surface 

without rotation of the device about its longitudinal axis; 
and 
means for causing the head (18/20) to be actuated to 
cause writing when the sensor (4) detects said movement of 

the writing head relative to the surface. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein 

the writing head (18/20) is arranged to be able to 
make a plurality of different types or sizes of marks on a 

writing surface; and further including 
means (8-11,19) for selecting which of the different 
mark types or sizes is to be made. 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 

movement sensor is a vibration sensor (4). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the writing head comprises a multi-nozzle ink jet writing 

head (18/20) which can be arranged to produce different 
patterns of marks, density of marks, marks of different 

width. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
incorporating a single nozzle ink jet writing head (22), 

and wherein the size of droplet produced may be adjusted by 
the selecting means (8-11), for example to vary the width 

of a line being drawn.  
 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, which 
includes a battery (12/62) to supply electrical power to an 

electronic circuit to monitor a plurality of 
switches (8-11), for selecting which of a number of 

different mark types or sizes is to be made, and the sensor 
(4) and to generate the appropriate signals to control the 

writing head (18/20), and to supply electrical power to an 
electronic power supply circuit (63) to drive the head and 

electronics with the necessary electrical supplies.
