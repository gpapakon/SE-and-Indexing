<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel peptide 
which has a receptor activity coupled to a GTP binding 
protein, and which is useful for treatment of diseases 
and the development of pharmaceutical products, 
and also relates to a DNA encoding the peptide. It is known that when the vagus nerve is 
stimulated, heart rate becomes slower. This phenomenon 
is known to be caused due to the activation of a specific 
K⁺ channel, at a sinoatrial node, mediated by 
acetylcholine secreted from the nerve cells of the vagus 
nerve end. Acetylcholine causing such an activity is 
generally called a neurotransmitter. As described above, animal cells make a function 
of mediating physiological responses to first messenger 
substances, such as neurotransmitters, hormones and 
autocoids, which are extracellular substances acting on 
the cells. Most of the first messenger substances bind 
to receptors which are specific glycoproteins present on 
the surface of a cell membrane, facing outward 
therefrom. A primary information transmitting 
substance, when binding to a receptor, activates an 
intracellular enzyme (hereinafter referred to as  
 
an "effecter") present in the cell membrane, facing 
inward therefrom. Upon activated, the intracellular 
enzyme produces second messenger substances, which is 
sent to the cell interior and mediates physiological 
responses specific for the second messenger substance. It is known that in such an information transmitting 
system, another protein is present in a pathway 
from the receptor to the effecter. It has been found 
that a guanine nucleotide binding-regulatory protein 
(hereinafter referred to as a "GTP binding protein") 
exist in the pathway, and acts to couple the receptor 
activation by the first messenger to effector 
molecules. The GTP binding protein exists as a complex form 
with a guanine nucleotide diphosphate (hereinafter 
referred to as "GDP"), which is generally inactive to 
the effector. The binding of the primary information 
transmitting substance to the receptor facilitates dissociation 
of GDP from the inactive-form GDP-GTP binding 
protein complex. As a result, the GDP-dissociated GTP 
binding protein binds to GTP and Mg⁺ions present in 
abundance in the cell, and is thereby converted to an 
active form. The active-form GTP binding protein activates 
the effecter. The GTP binding protein having such a functional 
activity consists of three subunits, namely, α, β and γ. 
In the GDP-bound inactive-form of the GTP binding 
protein, α, β and γ are united as a
