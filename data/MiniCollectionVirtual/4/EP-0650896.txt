<ABSTRACT>
A foldable box with an internal partition contains a partition-wall arrangement (13, 14, 15) of cardboard zones which are integrally connected to the blank of the foldable box. One of the partition zones (16) is bonded to a main zone (4). From the other partition zone, in the lower region of the compartment surrounded by the partition zones, a web extends transversely through the compartments, its upper edge bounding the compartments at the bottom. In this way, two bottles of different diameter and different height can be accommodated securely in the foldable box, their closure caps being located at the same height. The web provides the necessary height balance.

<CLAIMS>
Folding box for the reception of two bottles of
different diameters and heights, consisting of a

cuboid carcass formed from two main zones (2, 4) and
from two side zones (1, 3) connecting these to one

another, of folding flaps (5, 7, 9, 10) which are
attached to the side zones (1, 3) and are located at

the two respective ends of the side zones (1, 3) and
which are delimited from the side zones (1, 3) by

folding lines (e, f), of a bottom flap (6, 8) on at
least one of the main zones (2, 4), the bottom flaps

and lid flaps being delimited from the respective
main zone (2, 4) by folding lines (e, f), and of a

first adhesive tab (13) which is attached laterally
to the first of the main zones (4) and is delimited

from this by means of a folding line (d) and which
is bonded to that one of the said side zones (1, 3)

which is attached to the second main zone (2) via a
folding line (a), characterized in that there is

attached to the edge of the first adhesive tab (13),
which is located opposite that edge at which the

first adhesive tab (13) is connected to the first
main zone (4), a first partition zone (14) which is

delimited from the adhesive tab (13) at the respective
edge by a folding line (h), and in that there is

attached to the first partition zone (14) a second
partition zone (15) which, in its portion facing the

lid flap (11), is delimited from the first partition 
zone (14) by a folding line (i) which runs parallel

to the folding line (h) delimiting the first adhesive
tab (13) from the first partition zone (14), and

in that the second partition zone (15) has, at its
end facing away from the first partition zone (14),

a second adhesive tab (16) which is delimited from
the second partition zone (15) by means of a folding

line (j) and which is bonded to the first main zone
(4) to which the first adhesive tab (13) is

attached, the first and second adhesive tabs
(13, 16) being at a distance from one another which

is as large as the distance between the folding
lines (h, i) which delimit the first partition zone

(14), and in that a straight cut line (A) extends
perpendicularly to the said folding lines underneath

the upper portion of the second partition zone (15)
over the entire width of the latter and continuously

over approximately half the width of the first
partition zone (14) at a predetermined distance from

the bottom of the folding box, and at the end of

this cut line, in the first partition zone (14) and
approximately in the middle of the width of the

second partition zone (15), in each case one folding
line (k, l), starting from the cut line (A) extends

continuously in the direction of the bottom of the
folding box, the last-mentioned folding lines (k, l)

limiting between them a non-folded web (17) which
divides the lower portion of a chamber delimited in

the folding box from the partition zones (14, 15).
Folding box according to Claim 1, characterized in
that there is formed in the first partition zone

(14), above the straight cut line (A), an essentially
U-shaped cut line (B), the two ends of which

commence at the folding line (i) which delimits the
two partition zones (14, 15) from one another, and

a tag (18) limited by the U-shaped cut line (B) and
formed on the second partition zone (15) is connected, 

without a folding line, to the second partition
zone (15), the tag (18) forming, between the

compartment surrounded by the partition zones (14,
15) and the inner wall of the second main zone (2),

a further compartment reaching to the bottom of the
folding box.
Folding box according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the second partition zone (15) and tag (18)

together have a width which is as large as the width
of a side zone (1, 3) of the carcass of the folding

box.
Folding box according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a second straight cut line (C) extends

perpendicularly to the folding lines (a to d) and
parallel to the first cut line (A), above the latter,

over the entire width of the second partition
zone (15) and over approximately 1 cm of the first

partition zone (14), and at the end of the second
cut line (C), in the first partition zone (14) and

at a distance of approximately 1 cm from the folding
line (j) delimiting the second adhesive tab (16) and

located in the second partition zone (15), in each
case folding lines (m, n), starting from the cut

line (c), extend as far as the upper edge of the
partition zones (14, 15) and limit between them a

non-folded web (19) which narrows, in its free
cross-section by approximately 1 cm, the upper

region of the compartment limited by the partition
zones (14, 15).
Folding box according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that there is formed in the first

partition zone (14), approximately in the middle
between the lower and the upper end of the latter,

a second cut line (D) which runs perpendicularly to
the folding lines (a to d) and which extends over 

the entire first partition zone (14) and approximately
1 to 2 cm into the second partition zone

(15), a folding line (o), which delimits the first
partition zone (14) from the first adhesive tab

(13), starting from the second cut line (D), extends
at a distance of approximately 1 to 2 cm from the

folding line (h) delimiting the first partition zone
(14) from the first adhesive tab (13), parallel to

the latter, as far as the upper end of the first
partition zone (14), and the strip (20), of the

first partition zone (14), included between this
folding line (o) and the folding line (h) at the

first adhesive tab (13) is bonded to the first
adhesive tab (13) and the folding line (i) delimiting

the upper region of the first partition zone
(14) from the second partition zone (15), starting

from the end of the second cut line (D) located in
the second partition zone (15), extends as far as

the upper end of the partition zones (14, 15) the
web (17) outside the compartment formed by the

partition arrangement extending in the direction of
the second main zone (2) and as far as the lower end

of the first partion zone (14) and forming the lower
end of a further compartment.
