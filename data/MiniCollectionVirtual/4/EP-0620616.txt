<ABSTRACT>
A connector for coaxial and/or twinaxial cables for 
connecting the cables to regularly arranged signal and ground 

contact pins comprises a housing of insulating material and 
female signal and ground contacts regularly arranged in the 

housing. Further, the connector comprises an outer conductor 
enclosing at least one signal contact. The female signal and 

ground contacts are provided with identical parts which can be 
plugged on the contact pins. The outer conductor encloses at 

least a signal and a ground contact and the ground contact is 
connected with the outer conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector for coaxial
and/or twinaxial cables according to the preamble of claim 1.A connector of this type is disclosed in
US-A-5 114 364. In this known connector the outer conductor
comprises a support plate having a ground plane on the outer
side and conductive tracks on the inner side, wherein the
female ground contacts are mounted on the conductive tracks
and wherein these conductive tracks are interconnected to
the ground plane by means of through-holes in the support
plate provided with an electrically conductive lining.The invention aims to provide an improved connector
of the above-mentioned type.To this end the connector according to the invention
shows the characterizing features of claim 1.In this manner a connector is obtained, wherein the
signal and ground contacts are mainly made in an identical way
and wherein the outer conductor consists of a simple metal
casing of the housing in which the signal and ground contacts
are accommodated.Preferably the female signal and ground contacts are
aligned within the outer conductor.The invention will be further explained by reference
to the drawings in which two embodiments are shown.  Fig. 1 is a longitudinal section of an embodiment of
the connector according to the invention for two twinaxial
cables.Fig. 2 is a section according to the line II-II in
Fig. 1.Fig. 3 is a longitudinal section of a second
embodiment of the connector according to the invention for
three coaxial cables.Fig. 4 is a section according to the line IV-IV in
Fig. 3.Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal section of a connector 1
adapted to connect two twinaxial cables 2 to a printed circuit
board not further shown. A connector made in a usual manner is
mounted on the printed circuit board and comprises signal and
ground contact pins of a usual type regularly arranged in rows
and columns.The connector 1 comprises a housing 3 of insulating
material in which four female signal contacts 4 and a female
ground contact 5 are provided. The signal and ground contacts
4, 5 are aligned within the housing 3 and as for the portion
for contacting the contact pins they are made with mutually
identical contact parts 6.The connector 1 further comprises an outer conductor
7 enclosing the housing 3 and thus the signal and ground
contacts 4, 5. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the outer conductor
7 has a rectangular cross-section. At the end opposite of the
contact part 6 the ground contact 5 comprises a contact spring
element 8 contacting the inner side of the outer conductor 7.
