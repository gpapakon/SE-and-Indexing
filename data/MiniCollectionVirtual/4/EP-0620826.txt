<ABSTRACT>
The cloning, sequencing and expression of a novel receptor tyrosine kinase, termed tie, is described. The tie precursor comprises 1138 amino acid residues, about 1117 residues of which comprise the mature tie. The tie extracellular domain contains distinct stretches of amino acid sequence having features of the imunoglobulin, epidermal growth factor and fibronectin type III repeat protein families. Alternative splicing creates variants of tie which lack one of the epidermal growth factor homology domains. A specific tyrosine phosphorylated 117 kD glycoprotein is detected by specific tie-antisera from cultured cells expressing the tie gene. The tie mRNA is expressed in cultured endothelial cells as well as in a few tumor cell lines. In situ hybridization of human fetal and mouse embryonic tissues shows specific expression in endothelial cells of blood vessels. The tie DNAs and polypeptides of the invention may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases involving endothelial cells and their tie receptor such as neoplastic diseases involving tumor angiogenesis, wound healing, thromboembolic diseases, atherosclerosis and inflammatory diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
TIE, A NOVEL ENDOTHELIAL CELL RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to the field of genetic engineering and more particularly to genes for receptor tyrosine kinases, their insertion into recombinant DNA vectors, and the production of the resulting proteins in recipient strains of micro-organisms and recipient eukaryotic cells. More specifically, the present invention is directed to tie, a novel receptor tyrosine kinase, to nucleotide sequences encoding tie, and to methods for the generation of DNAs encoding tie and their gene products. Tie DNAs and polypeptides of the invention may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases involving endothelial cells and associated tie receptors, such as neoplastic diseases involving tumor angiogenesis, wound healing, thromboembolic diseases, atherosclerosis and inflammatory diseases.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe cellular behavior responsible for the development, maintenance, and repair of differentiated cells and tissues is regulated, in large part, by intercellular signals conveyed via growth factors and similar ligands and their receptors. The receptors are located on the cell surface of responding cells and they bind peptides or polypeptides known as growth factors as well as other hormone-like ligands. The results of this interaction are rapid biochemical changes in the responding cells, as well as a rapid and a long-term readjustment of cellular gene expression. Several receptors associated with various cell surfaces may bind specific growth factors.Tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the key modes of signal transduction across the plasma membrane. Several currently known protein tyrosine kinase genes encode transmembrane receptors for polypeptide growth factors and 

hormones such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) , insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) , platelet derived growth factors (PDGF-A and -B) , and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) . Heldin et al . , Cell Regulation , l : 555-566 (1990); Ullrich, et al . , Cell , 61 : 243-54 (1990). Growth factor receptors of endothelial cells are of particular interest due to the possible involvement of growth factors, such as FGFs, in several important physiological and pathological processes, such as vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory diseases.
