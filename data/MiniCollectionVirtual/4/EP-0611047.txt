<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the minimizing of call set-up time for calls 
requiring the use of service circuits provided from a separate switching system, such 

as a service circuit node (SCN). Groups of semi-permanent circuits through a public 
switched telephone network (PSTN) are allocated to each of the switching systems 

served by the SCN. Thus, whenever a switching system has a call that requires the 
use of a service circuit housed in the SCN, the connection is already established. 

Traffic is controlled by limiting the size of the semi-permanent circuit groups, but 
these groups can be made larger or smaller, up to some overall total for the SCN, as 

traffic to each switching system changes. Advantageously, this arrangement permits 
efficient use of a large group of service circuits at the SCN, while minimizing the 

total call set-up time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the allocation of resources such as service 
circuits to telecommunications calls. Modern telecommunications systems are making increasing use of 
intelligent service circuits, such as those having speech recognition and flexible 
announcement capabilities, for implementing telecommunications services. Among 
the services that use this type of intelligent service circuit are automated calling card 
and voice messaging services. Since these intelligent service circuits are relatively 
expensive and since they frequently use a common resource such as a large data 
base, it has been found economical to centralize these intelligent service circuits in a 
service circuit node (SCN) accessible from a number of switches. Alternatively, 
such service circuits could also be provided from each switch. Both of these 
arrangements have disadvantages. By providing service circuits in each switch, the 
size of the service circuit group is kept relatively small and so these service circuits 
tend to be under-utilized as are any members of a small group of common facilities. 
On the other hand, by concentrating the service circuits at a SCN, a delay is 
encountered in serving a call because of the need to establish a connection from the 
switch serving the call to the SCN, thence to the service circuit. These actions cause 
a call set-up delay and further require extensive use of processing resources by the 
accessing switching system and the accessed SCN. A problem of the prior art 
therefore is that there is no satisfactory arrangement for providing access to a large 
and therefore efficiently utilized group of sharable resources, such as intelligent 
service circuits, without incurring substantial delay and inefficient utilization of 
resources for controlling the accessing of the service circuits. The above problem is solved and an advance is made over the prior art 
in accordance with this invention wherein a plurality of switching systems are each 
connected via a group of semi-permanent, i.e., temporarily dedicated and not 
released between calls, network paths through a public switched telephone network 
(PSTN) to a system, such as a service circuit node, containing a group of resources, 
such as intelligent service circuits. Advantageously, this arrangement reduces the 
call set-up time while still allowing the large centralized service circuit group to be 
efficiently utilized. In accordance with one form of the invention, these semi-permanent  
 
PSTN paths are established from the
