<ABSTRACT>
An improved media axis image registration system for a 
multi-color inkjet printer/plotter (10). The inventive 

system comprises a carriage assembly (100) for retaining 
multiple inkjet cartridges (102, 104, 106, 108) or pens. 

Each cartridge (102, 104, 106, 108) has a plurality of 
nozzles (502, 504, 506, 508) adapted to eject ink in 

response to the application of an electrical signal 
thereto. A first mechanism (112) is provided for moving the 

carriage assembly (100) in a first (scan) axis. A second 
mechanism (152) is provided for moving print media (30) in 

a second (media) axis transverse to the first axis. A 
position encoder (152) senses the position of the carriage 

assembly in the media axis. A control circuit (300) 
provides electrical signals which cause the nozzles (502, 

504, 506, 508) in the inkjet cartridges (102, 104, 106, 
108) to eject ink onto the media (30) and create an image 

thereon in the form of a test pattern (40) in response to 
timing signals. The inventive system includes a sensor 

module (200) which optically senses the image and provides 
a set of sensed signals in response thereto. The sen
sed 
signals are sampled in accordance with position encoder 

signals to provide corrected timing signals. In a 
particular embodiment, the test pattern (140) is 

illuminated by a light source (232) in the sensor module 
(200). The light source (230) has spectral energy in the 

color bands of interest. The test pattern (40) includes a 
plurality of vertically spaced bars which, when scanned by 

the sensor module (200), allow the module (200) to generate 
an output signal of a given frequency. The output signal is 

sampled and processed to provide the corrected timing 
signals for activation of the nozzles. By detecting the 

position of the pattern (40), the misalignment of a 
particular pen may be corrected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printers and
plotters. More specifically, the present invention
relates to inkjet printers and plotters having multiple
pens for multi-color operation.While the present invention is described herein with
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular
applications, it should be understood that the invention
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will
recognize additional modifications, applications, and
embodiments within the scope of the claims and additional
fields in which the present invention would be of
significant utility.Inkjet printer/plotters, such as those sold by
Hewlett Packard Company, offer substantial improvements
in speed over the conventional X-Y plotter. Inkjet
printer/plotters typically include a pen having an array
of nozzles. The pens are mounted on a carriage which is
moved across the page in successive swaths. Each inkjet
pen has heater circuits which, when activated, cause ink
to be ejected from associated nozzles. As the pen 
is positioned over a given location, a jet of ink is
ejected from the nozzle to provide a pixel of ink at
a desired location. The mosaic of pixels thus created
provides a desired composite image.Inkjet technology is now well known in the art.
See, for example, U. S. Patents Nos. 4,872,027, entitled
PRINTER HAVING IDENTIFIABLE INTERCHANGEABLE HEADS, issued
October 3, 1989, to W. A. Buskirk et al. and 4,965,593,
entitled PRINT QUALITY OF DOT PRINTERS, issued October
23, 1990, to M. S. Hickman.Recently, full color inkjet printer/plotters have
been developed which comprise a plurality of inkjet pens
of diverse colors. A typical color inkjet
printer/plotter has four inkjet pens, one that stores
black ink, and three that store colored inks, e.g.,
magenta, cyan and yellow. The colors from the three
color pens are mixed to obtain any particular color.The pens are typically mounted in stalls within an
assembly which is mounted on the carriage of the
printer/plotter. The carriage assembly positions the
inkjet pens and typically holds the circuitry required
for interface to the heater circuits in the inkjet pens.Full color printing and plotting requires that the
colors from the individual pens be precisely applied to
the media. This requires precise alignment of the
carriage assembly. Unfortunately, mechanical
misalignment of the pens in conventional inkjet
printer/plotters results in offsets in the x direction
(in the media or paper axis) and in the y direction
