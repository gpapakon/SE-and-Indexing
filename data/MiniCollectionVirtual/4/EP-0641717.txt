<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 
(10)
 for applying a label onto a 
small, cylindrical article (A), such as a dry cell battery, 

is disclosed. A rotatable label transport drum 
(20)
 has a 
central, horizontal axis. A label is fed to the drum 

surface, retained thereto as the drum rotates, and moved 
with the rotating drum into an article wrapping position 


(21)
 defined at the upper area of the drum. An article 
delivery system 
(240)
, such as a star transfer wheel, 
delivers the articles sequentially onto the drum surface. 

The delivery system is spaced outward from the drum surface 
to clear the trailing edge of the label which is outwardly 

positioned from the drum surface. An attractive force is 
imparted on the article in a direction so as to aid smooth 

delivery of the article onto the drum surface and the label 
moving therewith. In one aspect of the invention, when the 

articles are magnetically attractive drycell batteries, at 
least one magnet 
(252)
 retains the drycells against an 
article engaging surface 
(434a)
 of a pressure plate 
(434)
 
which defines an article entrance portion 
(250)
 that is 
disposed downward to the drum surface so that the drycells 

are smoothly and tangentially transferred onto the drum 
surface. In another aspect of the invention, a web feed and 

cutting mechanism is disclosed. In still another aspect of 
the invention, an adhesive delivery system using a gravure 

roller is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method 
for applying a label onto a small, cylindrical article by 
smoothly and tangentially delivering the articles onto a 
label transport drum for wrap around labeling of the 
article. US-A-4 108 710 describes an apparatus for applying labels to 
containers wherein adhesive is applied to a predetermined location 
upon each of a succession of containers moved past a vacuum drum applying 
the leading edge of a label to each container at such location. The 
labels are successively cut from a strip by means ensuring continuous 
label movement and have an adhesive applied to a trailing edge thereof 
before application to containers. The containers are then moved to a 
discharge station where the labels are wrapped about the containers.  
 According to EP-A-579 984 (post-published; Art 54(3) EPC) 
small articles such as 
drycell batteries, lipstick containers, lip balm containers 
and the like are labeled with high quality, thin film 
polymeric labels. A strip of label material is fed to a 
label transport drum, which has an outer surface with a 
plurality of predetermined label areas on which labels are 
retained as the drum rotates. The labels are initially fed 
as a strip onto the drum surface, and then cut on the drum 
surface into labels of predetermined size. As each label moves with the rotating drum in its 
respective label area, an adhesive is applied onto the area 
adjacent the leading edge of the label to give the leading 
edge a tacky quality to the edge. A predetermined amount of 
solvent is evenly applied onto the area adjacent the 
trailing edge of the label so as to dissolve a portion of 
the treated surface of the label. The label moves to an 
article wrapping position where small articles, such as  
 
drycell batteries, are wrapped, securing first the leading 
edge to the article, followed by overlapping the trailing 
edge onto the leading edge so that the solvent positioned on 
the trailing edge of the label creates a solvent-seal bond. 
The labels are then heat shrunk over the articles. The 
apparatus provides for high quality cylindrical labeling of 
small articles such as drycell batteries using thin film, 
polymeric labels, e.g., typically less than 88.9 Âµm (0.0035") 
thickness. As disclosed in the copending parent application, 
a predetermined amount of solvent is applied to the area 
adjacent the trailing edge of the label by rotating a wiper 
member at a surface speed different from the speed of the 
label transport drum. The speed
