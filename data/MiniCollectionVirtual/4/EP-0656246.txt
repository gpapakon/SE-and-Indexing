<ABSTRACT>
Method for shrinking a shrink ring (26) placed around an object (22) to be clamped on a cylindrical support (12) and behind an axial obstacle (14, 22) connected to the support (12). The method includes the following steps:   a) - a shrinking tool (30, 34) is slipped around the support (12) over the axial obstacle (14, 22) until its jaws (32) in an expanded position are located in the radial plane of the ring (26) to be shrunk, b) - a spacer (42) with a central orifice (44) matched to the shrink ring (26) is fitted into the jaws (32) from behind the axial obstacle (14, 22), c) - finally, the shrinking tool (30, 34) is tightened in order to bring the jaws (32) and the spacer (42) which they contain into their respective tightened positions.

A process for shrinking a ring to be shrunk (26), placed
around an object (22) to be clamped on a cylindrical support (12) and

behind an axial obstacle (14, 22) connected to the support (12), by
means of a shrinking tool (30, 34) comprising jaws (32) capable of

adopting an expanded position and a retracted position,
characterised in that it comprises the following steps of :


a) - fitting the shrinking tool (30, 34), with its jaws (32) in
expanded position, around the support (12), over the axial obstacle

(14, 22), until said jaws (32) are disposed in the radial plane of the
ring to be shrunk (26),
b) - positioning in the jaws (32) in expanded position of the
shrinking tool (30, 34), by the rear of the axial obstacle (14, 22), a

spacer (42) presenting a substantially circular central opening (44)
and itself capable of adopting a retracted position and an expanded

position in which the outer periphery (52) of said spacer (42) is
adapted to the inner periphery of the jaws (32) in expanded position,

while the diameter of its central opening (44) is substantially equal to
that of the ring to be shrunk (26),
c) finally, tightening the shrinking tool (30, 34) in order to
bring the jaws (32) and the spacer (42) that they contain into their

respective retracted positions.
The process according to claim 1, characterised in that, the
spacer (42) comprising at least two parts (42a, 42b) mobile with

respect to one another in its plane, the step of positioning said
spacer (42) is preceded by a step of spacing said parts (42a, 42b)

apart with respect to one another in order to define a passage (46)
sufficient for at least the support (12) of the object to be clamped (22)

and by a step of bringing these parts (42a, 42b) together around said
support (12) until the passage (46) is substantially eliminated.
Device for carrying out the process according to claim 1 or 2,
comprising a shrinking tool (30, 34) which comprises jaws (32)

capable of adopting an expanded position and a retracted position,
characterised in that the shrinking tool (30, 34) presents a cavity (50)

defined towards the rear by its jaws (32) and adapted to contain the 
axial obstacle (14, 22) entirely, and in that the device comprises a

spacer (42) presenting a substantially circular central opening (44)
and itself capable of adopting a retracted position and an expanded

position, the outer periphery (52) of said spacer (42) being adapted
to the inner periphery of the jaws (32) in expanded position.
The device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
spacer (42) comprises two parts (42a, 42b) mobile with respect to

one another in its plane.
The device according to claim 4, characterised in that the two
parts (42a, 42b) of the spacer (42) are capable of being respectively

coupled to the two levers of pincers (49).
The device according to any one of claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that the spacer (42) is constituted by a plurality of

rigid angular sectors (54a, 54b, 54c, 54d, 54e, 54f, 54g, 54h) of
which at least certain are connected together by elastic elements

(56).
