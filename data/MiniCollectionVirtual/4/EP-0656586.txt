<ABSTRACT>
A personal computer system according to the present invention 
includes a primary system processor, a bus interface controller, a non 

volatile random access memory (NVRAM), and at least one I/O socket into 
which an alternate processor may be attached. The personal computer 

system is controllable exclusively by either the primary system processor 
or the alternate processor. A system reference diskette includes a 

utility for selecting either the primary system processor or the 
alternate processor. The bus interface controller stores information 

representative of the processor currently enabled. NVRAM stores 
information representative of the processor selected to control the 

personal computer system. The system reference diskette contains a 
Select Processor utility to select the processor to control the personal 

computer system and to update NVRAM to reflect the selected processor. 
During POST the currently enabled processor and the selected processor 

are compared. If different, the information in the bus interface 
controller is updated to reflect the selected processor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and system for 
selectively enabling either a primary processor resident on the system 
planar board or an alternate processor. Personal computer systems in general and IBM personal computers in 
particular have attained widespread use for providing computer power to 
many segments of today's modern society. Personal computer systems can 
usually be defined as a desk top, floor standing, or portable 
microcomputer that consists of a system unit having a single system 
processor, a display monitor, a keyboard, one or more diskette drives, a 
fixed disk storage, and an optional printer. One of the distinguishing 
characteristics of these systems is the use of a motherboard or system 
planar to electrically connect these components together. These systems 
are designed primarily to give independent computing power to a single 
user and are inexpensively priced for purchase by individuals or small 
businesses. Examples of such personal computer systems are IBM's 
PERSONAL COMPUTER AT and IBM's PERSONAL SYSTEM/2 Models 25, 30, 40, 
L40SX, 50, 50Z, 55SX, 57SX, 60, 65SX, 70, 80, 90 and 95. These systems can be classified into two general families. The 
first family, usually referred to as Family I Models, use a bus 
architecture exemplified by the IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER AT and other "IBM 
compatible" machines. The second family, referred to as Family II 
Models, use IBM's Micro Channel bus architecture exemplified by IBM's 
PERSONAL SYSTEM/2 Models 50 through 95. (IBM, PERSONAL COMPUTER AT, 
PERSONAL SYSTEM/2, PS/2 and MICRO CHANNEL are trade marks of 
International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, New York.) The Family I models typically used the popular INTEL 8088 or 8086 
microprocessor as the system processor. These processors have the 
ability to address one megabyte of memory. Later Family I models and the 
Family II models typically use the higher speed INTEL 80286, 80386, and 
80486 microprocessors which can operate in a real mode to emulate the 
slower speed INTEL 8086 microprocessor or a protected mode which extends 
the addressing range from 1 megabyte to 4 Gigabytes for some models. In  
 
essence, the real mode feature of the 80286, 80386, and 80486 processors 
provide hardware compatibility with software written for the 8086 and 
8088 microprocessors. As personal computer technology has developed and moved from eight 
to sixteen and eventually thirty two bit wide bus interaction and higher 
speed microprocessors capable of real and protected mode

A computer system comprising: 
   a primary system processor and an I/O socket to which an alternate 

system processor is attachable, wherein either the primary system 
processor or the alternate processor may be currently enabled; 

   means for storing a procedure for enabling either the primary 
system processor or the alternate processor; 

   nonvolatile memory means for storing, in memory locations thereof 
assigned to a selected processor, a value of either the primary 

system processor or the alternate processor, the value being 
representative of the selected processor; and 

   means, effective if the selected processor is not the currently 
enabled processor, for switching control of the computer system 

from the currently enabled processor to the selected processor. 
Apparatus for enabling a user of a computer system comprising a 
local processor bus, a primary processor coupled to the local processor 

bus, and a socket for attachment of an alternate processor, wherein the 
computer system is controllable exclusively by a single one of the 

primary and alternate processors at any time, when a said alternate 
processor is installed in the socket, to selectively enable either one of 

the primary and alternate processors at any time without removing the 
alternate processor from the socket, the apparatus comprising: 

   a nonvolatile memory for storing information representative of a 
selected one of the primary and alternate processors; 

   a bus interface controller, coupled to the local processor bus, the 
nonvolatile memory, the primary processor, and the socket; the bus 

interface controller comprising means for storing information 
representative of the primary or alternate processor currently 

enabled to control the computer system; 
   means, controllable by a program executable on the computer system, 

for interrogating the nonvolatile memory and the bus interface 
controller to compare the information representative of a selected 

 
one of the primary and alter

memory with the enabled processor identifying information stored in 

the bus interface controller; and

and currently enabled processor are different, for using the 
information representative of the selected processor to reconfigure 

the bus interface controller information and for enabling the 
selected one of the primary and alternate processors. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, comprising: 
   means for storing the information representative of the selected 

one of the primary and alternate processors in the nonvolatile 
memory. 
A method for configuring a personal computer system having a 
primary system processor and an I/O socket to which an alternate system 

processor is attachable, wherein either the primary system processor or 
the alternate processor may be currently enabled and in which storage 

means stores a procedure for enabling either the primary system processor
