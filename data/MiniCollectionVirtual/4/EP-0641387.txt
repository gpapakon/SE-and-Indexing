<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for preparing dye-free polyhydroxyalkanoates formed in the cells as storage substances during the culture of bacterial biomasses. The dried bacterial biomass is at first exposed for 10 to 120 minutes to a temperature between 80  DEG C and the lower limit of the polyhydroxyalkanoate melting range, and is then extracted with acetic acid; 1 to 10 parts per volume, expressed as a percentage, of an aliphatic carboxylic acid derivate, are added to the extracting agent.

<CLAIMS>
A process to make pigment-free polyhydroxy alkanoates from
bacterial biomass, preferably from the bacterial biomass of the

microorganism culture of Methylobacterium rhodesianum
IMET 11401 - DSM 8166 MB 126, with the process stages of


drying of the moist biomass
extraction of the dried biomass by means of acetic acid
precipitation of polyhydroxy alkanoates

where the dried biomass is subjected to a temperature between 80°C
and the lower limit of the melting range of the polyhydroxy alkanoates

over a period of 100 to 120 minutes, and the extracting agent contains 1
to 10 percent by volume of acetic anhydride or β-butyrolactone, relative

to the total volume of extracting agent.
