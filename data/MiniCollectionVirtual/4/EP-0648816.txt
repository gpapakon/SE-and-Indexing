<ABSTRACT>
Leather is dyed using dye mixtures containing at least two water-soluble dyes and at least two virtually water-insoluble pigments, the dyes and pigments being selected in such a way that the mixture of the dyes and the mixture of the pigments produce the same shade on the leather. Preference is given to using at least two water-soluble dyes and at least two pigments selected, respectively, from a group of water-soluble dyes or pigments suitable for trichromatic dyeing.
