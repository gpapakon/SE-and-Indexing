claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein gaseous molybdenum hexacarbonyl

is oxidatively decomposed at from 100 to 500°C in an
oxygen-containing atmosphere.
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein molybdenum hexacarbonyl
is vaporized with an inert gas stream prior to decomposition

at from 20 to 100°C.
The use of blue molybdenum oxide as claimed in claim 1 or 2
for coloring finishes, printing inks, inks and plastics.
The use of blue molybdenum oxide as claimed in claim 1 or 2
for the preparation of a toner for electrophotography.
