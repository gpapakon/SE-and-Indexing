<ABSTRACT>
A roller mill containing therein a rotary 
classifier, which has a classification performance improved, 

is disclosed. A weir 14 having an annular cross-section for 
diverting an air flow 4a separated from a carrier air flow 4 

rising within a mill and flowing towards the center axis of 
the mill along a mill top ceiling surface 5 as containing 

coarse particles into a descending flow, is mounted to the 
mill top ceiling surface 5 coaxially with a rotary shaft of 

the rotary classifier radially on the outside of blades 7 of 
the rotary classifier, the bottom end of the weir 14 is 

located at the position where the above-mentioned descending 
flow is made to join with a main flow 4 of the carrier air 

flow rising within the mill, whereby coarse particles short-cutting 
the rotary classifier are eliminated so as to 

improve a classification performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roller mill 
containing therein a rotary classifier such as, for example, 
a coal beater employed for a coal-burning boiler in a 
utility or non-utility electric power plant, a cement 
grinding mill or the like. In a heretofore known roller mill containing 
therein a rotary classifier, as shown in Fig. 2, raw 
material to be ground such as coal or the like is ground by 
a grinding roller 2 rotating on a grinding table 1, and the 
ground raw material 3 is carried upwards within the mill by 
carrier air flows rising within the mill. Within the mill, 
there are provided a rotary classifier having blades 7 
rotating about a vertical rotary shaft at the center of 
the mill as driven by a rotor 8 directed in the vertical 
direction, and deflector vanes 9 mounted to a mill top plate 
5a forming a ceiling surface 5 of the mill top, the flows of 
the ground raw material 3 and the carrier air flow 4 are 
caused to pass through the blades 7 of the rotary classifier 
by means of the deflector vanes 9, and fine powder 
classified by the rotary classifier is discharged through  
 
a fine powder outlet 6 provided on the mill top plate 5a. In the heretofore known roller mill containing 
therein a rotary classifier, although provision is made such 
that the ground raw material and the carrier air flow 4 are 
made to pass through the blades 7 of the rotary classifier 
by means of the deflector vanes as described above, as shown 
in Fig. 3, coarse particles in the raw material 3 carried by 
the carrier air flow 4 would reach the ceiling surface 5 of 
the mill top due to their inertia as indicated by an arrow 
4a, and then would flow towards the center of the mill along 
the top ceiling surface 5 jointly with a part of the carrier 
air flow. In the roller mill containing therein a rotary 
classifier in the prior art, as shown in Fig. 3, the rotary 
classifier is equipped with a gap clearance 11 of 2 - 4 mm 
retained between the ceiling surface 5 and the classifier. 
Due to the fact that a rotary classifier is one kind of fan, 
a static pressure P₁ at the inlet of the blades 7 is 
somewhat higher than a static pressure P₂ within the blades 
7. Accordingly, the air flow 4a containing coarse particles 
and flowing along the ceiling surface 5 is caused to take a 
short-cut as indicated by an arrow 4b due to the above-mentioned 
pressure difference (P₁ > P₂).  It is therefore one object of the present 
invention to provide an improved roller mill containing 
therein a rotary classifier, which
