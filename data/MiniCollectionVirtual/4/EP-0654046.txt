<ABSTRACT>
Inner esterification of gellan in which the carboxy groups are esterified totally or partially with hydroxy groups from the molecule itself and/or different molecules of the polysaccharide itself leads to auto-cross-linked gellan. In partially inner esterified gellan the remaining carboxy groups may be partially or totally esterified with monovalent or polyvalent alcohols. Non-esterified carboxy groups can be free or salified. Inner esters of gellan may be used in cosmetics, in pharmaceuticals, in sanitary and in surgical articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intra- and/or
intermolecular esters of the acidic polysaccharide
gellan containing carboxy functions (glycuronan),
wherein part of or all such functions are
intraesterified with the hydroxy groups of the same
gellan molecule, and, in addition, can be further
interesterified with the hydroxy group of a different
gellan molecule, thus forming intra/intermolecular
lactonic or ester bonds. Intramolecular and
intermolecular esters will be commonly defined as "inner
esters". These inner esters of glycuronanes, wherein
no hydroxy groups of other alcohols intervene, can also
be defined as "auto-cross-linked polysaccharides". In
the present specification, both terms will be used to
define the new compounds of the present invention. The
term "auto-cross-linked" refers to bridge links between
the carboxy groups and hydroxy groups within the
polysaccharide chain. Said inner esterification leads
to the formation of a macromolecular network.Depending on whether all or only some of the
carboxy functions are esterified in the above manner,
the new inner esters may be totally or partially
esterified, i.e. total or partial esters. In the
partial inner esters the remaining carboxy groups may
be totally or partially esterified with the same or
different monovalent or polyvalent alcohols, thus
forming "outer" ester groups and, in the partial esters
of both ester families, (i.e. both inner and outer 
esters) the non-esterified carboxy functions can be free
or salified with pharmaceutically accepted metals or
organic base counterions, which salts form part of the
invention. The terms "polymeric gellan esters" and
"polymers of gellan" used in the present invention
designate auto-cross-linked gellan, esters, both totally
and partially inner esterified, and outer esters formed
totally or partially on the remaining carboxy groups and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Esterification between different gellan molecules
(intermolecular esterification) results in an increase
in the molecular weight of the product, the extent of
which depends on and is proportional to the number of
chains involved in auto-cross-linking. Lactone
formation, on the other hand, if not accompanied by
inter-chain linkage formation, would not result in a
detectable change in molecular weight. The degree of
cross-linking varies according to the conditions used
in the preparation procedure which will be described
hereinafter, especially the temperature and duration of
the reaction. These conditions are described in the
il
