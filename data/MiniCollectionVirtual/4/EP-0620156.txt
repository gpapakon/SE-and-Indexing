<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a stand-up pouch comprising dry or powdered 
product formed from a length of generally flat material, the 

longitudinal edges of said length being connected together by a 
longitudinal seal (1), and the opposite ends (2,3) and of the tube so 

formed being closed, wherein on one lateral side (5) only a portion of 
the plastic container adjacent each of the said ends is folded inwardly 

so as to form a gusset (4). According to the present invention, this 
pouch will stand on the gusset (4) when presented on the shelf. The 

present invention relates also to the method of making such a pouch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pouch of plastic 
material, of the type produced by welding and severing 
sheets or tubes of plastic material at spaced locations, 
and a method for making same. The present invention 
relates more particularly to a stand-up easy-pour refill 
pouch for dry or powdered product. Many and various forms of stand-up plastic containers used 
as utility packages for receiving most dry, powdered or 
even granular commodities have been extensively described 
in the art as well as their fabrication methods. Representative of the prior art are the plastic pouches 
disclosed in US-5 184 896 issued February 9, 1993 and 
entitled "Self-expanding flexible pouch including improved 
extensible stay to maximize opening". Said '896 patent 
discloses a plastic pouch having a bottom gusset attached 
to the inner surface of the sidewall panels. Also, well-known 
in the art are the stand-up plastic containers which  
 
provide the stand up capability merely by a bottom gusset 
sealed into a strong, sturdier and stable stand-up base. 
Representative of this prior art is the plastic bag 
disclosed in EP-0 334 242 entitled "Stand-up plastic bag 
and method of making same". It is also known to form a plastic container by connecting 
together the longitudinal edges of a length of generally 
flat material to form a tube having a longitudinally 
extending seal, and by subsequently closing the ends of 
this tube to form the top and bottom of the plastic 
container. The ends of said container are usually closed 
by transverse seals, and opening of the package is achieved 
by tearing through one of these seals. It is also known to 
produce such plastic containers having two gussets located 
on each of their lateral sidewalls. Such plastic 
containers, without any gussets or with two gussets 
respectively located on each of the lateral sidewalls of 
said plastic container, stand on the their bottom 
transverse seals. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
plastic stand-up pouch. It is a further object of the 
present invention to provide stand-up pouches which allow a 
simpler and less costly method of making them. Indeed, the 
present invention allows to reduce the number of parts or 
of operations for the manufacturing of said stand-up pouch 
over the stand-up containers disclosed by the prior art. 
According to the present invention, these objects are met 
by providing a stable stand-up pouch which comprises only 
one gusseted side wall. Said stand-up pouch according to 
the present

<CLAIMS>
1. A stand-up pouch comprising dry or powdered product, 
formed from a length of generally flat material, the 

longitudinal edges of said length being connected 
together by a longitudinal seal (1), and the opposite 

ends (2) and (3) of the tube so formed being also sealed 
characterized in that said pouch on one of its lateral 

sides (5) only comprises a portion adjacent each of the 
said ends which is folded inwardly so as to form a 

gusset (4), on which said pouch stands. 
2. A method for making a stand-up pouch according to any of 
the preceding claims comprising the step of: 


supplying a film (10) of a generally flat material, 
feeding the film onto a tube (11) so as to make a 
tube of said film, 
sealing the overlapping edges of said film by a 
longitudinal seal bar (12), 
forming said gusset by tucking means (13) on one 

lateral side only, 
sealing said film by sealing means (14) so as to 
obtain a pouch which is closed on one of its opposite 

ends, 
filling said pouch by the filling head (11) with the 
dry or powdered product, 
sealing and cutting the filled pouch by cutting (15) 
and sealing means (14). 
3. A stand-up pouch according to claims 1 or 2 wherein the 
opposite side of the gusset is a straight top. 
3. A stand-up pouch according to claim 3 wherein said 
straight top comprises opening means. 
4. A stand-up pouch according to any of the preceding 
claims wherein the generally flat material used is a 

 
multi-layered film with a first and second thermoplastic 

material, said first material is translucent and 
constitutes the outside layer of the pouch whereas said 

second material on which the advertising messages are 
printed constitutes the inside layer. 
5. A stand-up pouch according to claim 4 wherein the multilayered 
material used is made of a high density 

polyethylene having a thickness of 100 microns as the 
inside layer and of a low density polyethylene having a 

thickness of 30 microns as the ouside layer.
