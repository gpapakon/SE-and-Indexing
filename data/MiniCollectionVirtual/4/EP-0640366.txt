<ABSTRACT>
A support apparatus (10) for supporting a lure (77) 
which apparatus (10) comprises a trolley (50) having 

wheels (55, 56) for engaging with one or more rails 
(16, 17); a drive pulley (57) and two associated idler 

pulleys (58, 59); a drive means for the drive pulley 
(57). When mounted on the or each rail (16, 17), the 

drive pulley (57) and the associated idler pulleys (58, 
59) are interengageable with an endless stationary 

cable (24) so that upon actuation of the motor means 
the trolley (50) moves along the rails (16, 17) 

relative to the stationary cable (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lure device. In 
particular it relates to a lure device for use on a 
greyhound track. Greyhound tracks are well known. They 
generally comprise a circular or oval shaped arena 
surrounded by a spectator area. In the arena, 
greyhounds are raced from respective traps, located at a 
start line, to a finish line a predetermined distance 
away around the track. In order to encourage the dogs 
to race, a lure is provided which, generally speaking, 
comprises a silhouette of a hare fixed fast to an 
endless cable. The cable is usually buried in suitable 
casing underground with a slot in the casing for 
enabling a support connecting the lure to the cable to 
pass through the casing. The lure is set in motion by 
means of a suitable motor housed in a control centre 
located at some suitable point on the track which drives 
the cable on the circuitous pathway around the perimeter 
of the track. The velocity of the cable will determine 
the velocity of the lure and there is usually suitable  
 
means for varying the velocity of the cable depending on 
the velocity of the dogs chasing the lure. The above described system, with slight 
variation has been in existence for some considerable 
time. The known system has been found to be generally 
reliable but only where the track is primarily grass or 
at least not having a coating of sand thereon. Sand 
tracks are becoming increasingly popular due to the 
relative ease of maintenance and also because it 
promotes a faster velocity from the dogs. However, a 
significant disadvantage of sand tracks is that the sand 
can easily enter the slot through which the lure support 
passes thereby causing significant maintenance problems 
and frequent breakdowns in operation of the system. One 
way of overcoming this problem has been the installation 
of the known system on the internal perimeter of the 
track as distinct from the external perimeter. However, 
this internal position of the lure is not favoured by 
the organisers or by the punters and hence is not very 
popular. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome these problems. The invention, therefore provides a support 
apparatus for supporting a lure which apparatus 
comprises a trolley having wheels for engaging with one 
or more rails; a drive pulley and two associated idler 
pulleys; a drive means for the drive pulley; the  
 
arrangement being such that when mounted on the or each 
rail, the drive pulley and the associated idler pulleys 
are interengageable with an endless

A support apparatus for supporting a lure 
which apparatus comprises a trolley having wheels for 

engaging with one or more rails; a drive pulley and two 
associated idler pulleys; a drive means for the drive 

pulley; the arrangement being such that when mounted on 
the or each rail, the drive pulley and the associated 

idler pulleys are interengageable with an endless 
stationary cable so that upon actuation of the motor 

means the trolley moves along the rails relative to the 
stationary cable. 
A support apparatus as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the axis of drive pulley and the axes of idler 

pulleys are in substantially parallel spaced apart 
relationship being transverse to the axes of the wheels. 
A support apparatus as claimed in claim 2 
wherein the axes of the pulleys provide for the 

respective apices of a notional triangle. 
A support apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or 
claim 3 wherein the idler pulleys are substantially 

co-planar and the drive pulley is non-coplanar relative 
to the idler pulleys. 
A support apparatus as claimed in any of 
claims 1-4 which further comprises one or more support 

rails for enabling the wheels to traverse therealong and 
means for enabling an electrical connection to be made 

from the support rail so as to power the motor. 
A support apparatus as claimed in claim 5 
which further comprises a plurality of u-shaped support 

 
elements each having legs of unequal length for 

supporting the rail or rails, the longer leg being 
ground engaging and the shorter leg terminating a 

distance above the ground, each support having means for 
enabling the cable to rest thereon when not in 

engagement with the pulleys. 
A support apparatus as claimed in claim 6 
which further comprises a facia mounted on the shorter 

leg so as to conceal the rails and the trolley from 
general view, the facia terminating above the ground so 

that an arm, one end of which is attached to the trolley 
and the other end having the lure attached thereto, does 

not, during travel of the trolley, engage with the 
shorter leg or the facia thereby permitting the lure to 

be seen against the background of the facia. 
A support apparatus as claimed in claim 7 
wherein the arm is pivotally attached to the trolley, 

biasing means is provided for urging the arm and hence 
the lure in a ground engaging direction, the lure having 

a ground engaging skid so that in use, the skid serves 
to prevent the lure from engaging with the ground which 

skid traverses the ground including undulating ground 
which provides a force acting against the biasing means.
