<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus includes: a photoreceptor 
allowing an electrostatic latent image to be formed by light 

exposure; a light source emitting light beams; a light 
deflecting means for deflecting light beams from the light 

source; an exposure controlling means for controlling 
deflecting actions of the deflecting means; and an image-forming 

optical means receiving light beams deflected by the 
light deflecting means and image-forming the light beams on 

the photoreceptor so as to create a latent image composed 
of a plurality of pixels thereon. In the configuration, the 

light deflecting means is a micro-mirror array device which 
is composed of a multiple number of mirror facet elements 

arranged matrix-wise in two-dimension and which is disposed 

so that each row of the mirror facet elements extends in 
parallel with the rotating axis of the photoreceptor and 

normals of the mirror facet elements are substantially 
perpendicular to the rotating axis of the photoreceptor, and 

each mirror facet of the mirror facet elements can 
individually be controlled to be oriented at any angle by 

application of voltages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus which, based on image signals representing 
characters, patterns etc., creates an image with a great 
number of pixels in the form of a latent image on a surface 
of a photoreceptor. Particularly, the invention is directed 
to an image forming apparatus which creates a latent image 
on the photoreceptor surface by using a novel light 
deflecting device. A laser printer having a semiconductor laser as a light 
source thereof, emits a laser beam, which in turn is 
deflected for scanning by a rotating polygonal mirror so as 
to irradiate a rotating photoreceptor whereby an 
electrostatic latent image corresponding to an image to be 
formed is created on the photoreceptor surface. Thereafter, 
the thus formed latent image is formed into an actual image 
on a transfer sheet by way of operations such as developing, 
transferring and fixing.  
 In the field of the laser printers, in order to improve 
quality of recording images, especially for modifying 
jaggedness in slant line portions etc., some laser printers 
have been proposed in which illuminating time of a 
semiconductor laser is controlled to diminish jagged 
portions. Specifically, the modification is achieved by 
controlling the timing of illumination of the laser or by 
selecting combinations of lighted time and unlighted time 
of the laser so that jagged portions may be interpolated 
with dots. Interpolation is also performed by adding dots 
by utilizing overlapping of base portions or slowly 
attenulating plateau part of the Gaussian light intensity 
distribution of the laser beam. On the other hand, in LED printers using a light-emitting 
diode (LED) array as a light source, the LED array 
is disposed in substantially parallel with a rotational axis 
of a photoreceptor and will write image information on 
characters, patterns etc., onto the photoreceptor by one 
line in the main scanning direction symultaneously. LED 
printers, unlike laser printers, do not need any light 
deflecting device such as a rotating polygonal mirror etc. 
since there is no necessity of deflecting light beam for 
scanning. However, in LED printers, it is not so simple as in the 
laser printer to control light output and illuminating time  
 
of light beam for the purpose of enhancing resolution of 
images. One of the reasons of the difficulty is due to the 
fact that, while a semiconductor laser as a writing light 
source of laser printers has a Gaussian light intensity 
distribution which has slowly
