<ABSTRACT>
1.1. To increase the performance of packaging machines for cigarettes, a common cigarette stock, namely a cigarette magazine, is assigned a plurality of independently working packaging units (11, 12, 13, 14). These are supplied from the cigarette magazine (10) with cigarette groups for packaging via a common conveyor. The packaging units (11..14) consist of a folding unit (24), of a material unit and of a drive unit. Depending on the desired performance, a plurality of packaging units (11..14) can be assembled as part of the packaging machine. 1.2. The packaging units (11..14) are subdivided once again into units to be handled independently, namely into a folding unit (24), a material unit and a drive unit. These are connected to one another exchangeably and functionally for the operation of the packaging machine.

Packaging machine for the production of cigarette 
packs (15), especially hinge-lid packs, with a central 

cigarette stock, in particular a cigarette magazine (10), 
to which a plurality of packaging units, each with 

folding members for the folding of blanks to form the 
packs (15) and with assemblies for the stocking and 

handling of packaging material, in particular material 
assemblies, are connected, characterized in that the 

packaging units (11, 12, 13, 14) being connected to the 
cigarette magazine (10) by means of a common continuous 

conveyor, for the transport of formed cigarette groups, 
corresponding to the content of a cigarette pack (15), to 

the individual packaging units (11 to 14), especially by 
means of a 
pocket chain (16) with pockets (17), each for 
receiving a cigarette group of this type. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the packaging units (11 to 14) are 

arranged in succession in a row in the conveying 
direction of the pocket chain, whilst the cigarette 

groups can be conveyed to the packaging units (11 to 14) 
by being pushed out of the pockets (17) transversely to 

the conveying direction of the pocket chain (16). 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the pocket chain (16) runs in a 

plane directly below the folding units (24) located next 
to one another, and characterized in that, in the region 

of a pushing-in station (18) of each packaging unit (11 
to 14), cigarette groups can be transferred from the 

pocket chain (16) onto the folding units (24) in the  
 

lower region of the latter, especially via a turning 
wheel (30) for rotating the cigarette groups through 

90Â°. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the cigarette magazine (10) has a 

number of shaft groups (20, 21, 22, 23), each for forming 
a cigarette group capable of being pushed out of these, 

which corresponds to the number of packaging units (11 to 
14) to be fed. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that a plurality of, especially two 

shaft groups (20, 21) are combined to form a common 
container unit and further, especially two shaft groups 

(22, 23) can be fed with cigarettes independently of one 
another. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 1 or one of 
the further claims, characterized in that each packaging 

unit (11 to 14) consists of a plurality of, especially of 
three independently handleable part units, especially of 

a folding unit (24), of a material unit (25) and of a 
drive unit (26). 
Packaging machine according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the folding unit (24) and material unit 

(25) are designed as vertical units, with a housing-like 
supporting device which has at least one supporting wall 

(27, 43) for the mounting of folding members on the one 
hand and of material assemblies on the other hand. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the folding unit (24) and material 

unit (25) being in a relative position such that the 
folding members on the one hand and the material assemblies 

on the other hand are free, especially by the 
folding unit (24) and material unit (25) lying back-to-back 

with supporting walls (27, 43) facing away from one 
another, or such that the folding unit (24) and material 

unit (25) are arranged at right angles to one another. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the independent drive unit (26) is 

arranged underneath the folding unit (24) and/or material  
 

unit. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the folding members on the one hand 

and the material assemblies on the other hand are mounted 
one above the other and next to one another by means of 

horizontal rotary axles or drive shafts (38, 39) on the 
vertical folding units (24) and the material units (25) 

respectively. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that there are arranged on the folding unit 

(24), especially on its supporting wall (27), a conveyor 
track, extending in the upward direction from below, for 

the transport of cigarette groups wrapped in an inner 
blank (32), that is to say cigarette blocks (33), and, 

approximately mid-height and centrally, a folding turret 
(28), rotating in a vertical plane, for the processing of 

pack blanks (36), and thereafter, especially above the 
folding turret (28), conveying members for the upwardly 

leading transporting away of the cigarette packs (15), 
especially a transfer turret (37) and a discharge conveyor 

(19). 
Packaging machine according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that, with the folding unit (24) and 

material unit (25) resting against one another, the 
blanks or material webs formed or stocked in the region 

of the material unit (25) can be conveyed, via matching 
recesses (51, 52; 57, 58; 61, 62) in the folding unit 

(24) on the one hand and the material unit (25) on the 
other hand, from the latter to the free side of the 

folding unit (24).
