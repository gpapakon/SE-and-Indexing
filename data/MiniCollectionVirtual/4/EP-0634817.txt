<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector component assembly (10) provides 
for shielding as between components of the connector. An 

electrically conductive outer housing (12) includes a 
plurality of discrete bounded compartments (30). A 

plurality of electrically insulative terminal support 
elements (14,16) are supported individually in the bounded 

compartments. Plural electrical contacts (18,20) are 
supported in at least one of the support elements. The 

electrical contacts supported in the one support element are 
electrically shielded from the components of the other 

support element by the bounded compartments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to improvements
in shielded electrical data connectors. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a compact design for a
shielded electrical data connector wherein electrical
contacts of the connector are electrically shielded from
other components of the connector.Improvements in the electrical data transmission
industry, especially in the computer field, have resulted in
the ability to transmit data along transmission lines at
increasingly higher data rates. Further, similar
improvements have also seen the decrease in the size of the
equipment used in the industry. In order to function
effectively with such equipment, the interconnection
technology, such as the electrical cables and electrical
connectors which connect such equipment, has also undergone
significant improvements. Electrical connectors are now
smaller and capable of transmitting data at higher rates
between such components.The requirement to make the electrical connectors
smaller necessitates putting the conductive contacts of such
connectors in closer proximity. However, when transmitting
data at higher data rates, this physical proximity also
increases the cross-talk levels between such electrical
contacts. Accordingly, the industry has seen the need for
improved shielding within the electrical connectors so as to
reduce cross-talk levels in the smaller connectors working
at higher data rates. This is especially prevalent in
connectors used in closed-loop data systems which provide
for continuity of signal in a multi-component system when
certain of the connectors are not interconnected. These
closed-loop systems employ connectors containing devices
which permit automatic shunting so that a closed-loop 
connection is maintained even when a connector is in a non-connected condition. Such
shunting devices in these connectors render effective shielding even more difficult.It is, therefore, desirable to provide an electrical connector which provides for
shielding in a compact connector design and which reduces cross-talk between contacts of
the connector when operating at higher data rates.US-A-5169324 discloses an electrical connector comprising an electrically
conductive outer housing having a single internal space, a separate ground structure within
the housing defining a plurality of discrete bounded compartments, electrically insulative
support elements, each support element being accommodated in one of the compartments,
and plural transmission terminal devices supported in at least
