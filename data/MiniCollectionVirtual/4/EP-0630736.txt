<ABSTRACT>
Fabric useful for processing into a fiber reinforced composite is made 
from multicomponent yarn having a thermoplastic matrix component of a first melting 

point if crystalline or a first softening point if not crystalline and a drawable, oriented, 
fibrous thermoplastic reinforcing component of a second melting point if crystalline or 

a second softening point if not crystalline, wherein said first melting or softening point 
is at least 5°C below said second melting or softening point.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to reinforced composite items and 
processes for making them. More specifically, this invention relates to reinforced 
composite articles made substantially completely from thermoplastic materials. As used herein, the term "fiber includes fibers of extreme or 
indefinite length ("filaments") and fibers of short length ("staple"). The term "fabric" 
denotes a two, or possibly three, dimensional product built up from fibers. These 
fibers may occur in the fabric uni-directionally, bi-directionally with different warp 
and woof ratios or tri-directionally. The terms "mixed fiber" or "mixed fibers" refer 
to yarns composed of two or more different types of fibers. The terms 
"multicomponent fiber" or "multicomponent fibers" refer to fibers having two or more 
longitudinally coextensive components. The terms "multicomponent yarn" or 
"multicomponent yarns" refer to either mixed fiber yarns, multicomponent fibers, or 
mixtures of them. Fiber reinforced products are known. Such products make possible 
the manufacture of advanced thermoplastic composite parts in very complex shapes. 
The traditional composites take the form of a thermoplastic matrix reinforced by 
non-thermoplastic fibers, such as graphite, glass, ceramics and similar fibers. These  
 
materials may be found in many "high-tech" applications such as for aircraft 
components and recreational equipment. U.S. Patent No. 4,539,249 ("'249") describes laminates of graphite, 
glass, aramides, ceramics, quartz, boron, SiC, etc., and resinous thermoplastic fibers 
which are intended for conversion into a composite. To make the pre-consolation 
form, resinous thermoplastic fibers are combined or blended with the reinforcing 
fibers to form a single yarn. The blended yarn is then woven into a fabric that is 
shaped to a suitable form in a mold and then heated to melt the thermoplastic 
component. Also described is a process for spinning staple resin fibers with graphite 
to form the yarn which is then woven into the fabric, shaped and heated. Fabrics 
formed by interweaving the graphite in the resin fibers by conventional weaving 
techniques is also disclosed. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,874,563 ("'563"), 4,818,318 ("'318"), and 4,871,491 
("'491") describe methods of forming fiber reinforced composites by forming a tape 
or fabric prepreg especially of carbon fiber tows intermixed with thermoplastic matrix 
fibers. Also described is a process involving the extrusion of carbon fiber tapes 
impregnated with high melting thermoplastic

<CLAIMS>
The use of a fabric for processing into a fiber reinforced 
composite, said fabric comprising: 

   a multicomponent fiber having a thermoplastic matrix 
component of a first melting point if crystalline or a first softening point if not 

crystalline and a drawable, fibrous thermoplastic reinforcing component of a second 
melting point if crystalline or a second softening point if not crystalline, 

   wherein said first melting or softening point is at least 5°C below 
said second melting or softening point. 
The use of a fabric for conversion into a fiber reinforced 
laminate, the fabric being produced by the process comprising: 

   co-spinning in a yarn a fibrous matrix thermoplastic component with a 
first melting point if crystalline or a first softening point if not crystalline, and a 

drawable fibrous reinforcing thermoplastic component with a second melting point if 
crystalline or a second softening point if not crystalline, wherein said first melting point 

is at least 5°C below said second melting point; and 
   fabricating the yarn into a fabric. 
A process for forming fiber reinforced laminates comprising: 
   extruding a multicomponent yarn having in the same threadline a fibrous 

matrix thermoplastic component with a first melting point if crystalline or a first 
 

softening point if not crystalline, and a drawable fibrous reinforcing thermoplastic 
component with a second melting point if crystalline or a second softening point if not 

crystalline, wherein said first melting point is at least 5° C below said second melting 
point; 

   fabricating the yarn into a pre-consolidation fabric; 
   shaping the pre-consolidation fabric by conforming the fabric onto a 

mold or substrate; and 
   heating the shaped pre-consolidation fabric to the first melting or 

softening point but not to the second melting or softening point such that the matrix 
component melts and consolidates the reinforcing component. 
The process of claim 3 wherein said extruding is of a matrix 
component selected from the group consisting of: 

   polyolefins; polyamides; polyesters; polysulfones; polyaryletherketones; 
polyimides; polystyrenes; polylactones; polycarbonates; and polyethers. 
The process of claims 3 to 4 wherein said extruding is 
of a reinforcing component selected from the group consisting of: 

   polyolefins; polyamides; polyesters; polysulfones; polyaryletherketones; 

polyimides; polycarbonates; and polyethers.
