<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns microbicidal compositions which include an 
isothiazolone and one or more other biocides, and which are intended to provide 
more effective and broader control of micro-organisms in various industrial 
systems and for household products, agricultural products, and biomedical 
products, etc. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of a 
composition of 2-methyl-isothiazolin-3-one, hereinafter referred to as 2-methyl-3-isothiazolone, 
with 4-(2-nitrobutyl)morpholine. The term "microbicidal" (or "antimicrobial" or "biocidal") as used herein is 
intended to encompass, but is not restricted to, all bactericidal, fungicidal and 
algicidal activity. Isothiazolones are described in U.S.-A-3,761,488; 4,105,431; 4,252,694; 4,265,899 
and 4,279,762, and elsewhere. Their use as microbicides is well known. We have found that compositions formed from 2-methyl-3-isothiazolone 
and 4-(2-nitrobutyl)morpholine unexpectedly afford synergistic antimicrobial 
activity against a wide range of microorganisms: the disruptive action on the 
organisms by the two compounds together is unexpectedly greater than the sum of 
both compounds taken alone. This synergy does not arise from the expected 
activity of the components nor from the expected improvement in activity. As a 
result of the synergy, the effective dose required can be lowered, which is not only 
more economical but also increases safety margins. The synergistic compositions of 
the present invention provide more effective and broader control of 
microorganisms in a number of systems. The present invention thus provides a composition having microbicidal 
activity which includes 2-methyl-3-isothiazolone and 4-(2-nitrobutyl)morpholine 
wherein the weight ratio of 2-methyl-3-isothiazolone to 4-(2-nitrobutyl)morpholine 
is from about 40:1 to 1:16. Important applications of the synergistic antimicrobial compositions of the  
 
present invention include but are not limited to: inhibiting the growth of bacteria 
and fungi in aqueous paints and coatings, adhesives, sealants, latex emulsions, and 
joint cements; preserving wood; preserving cutting fluids, controlling slime-producing 
bacteria and fungi in pulp and papermills and cooling towers; as a spray 
or dip treatment for textiles and leather to prevent mold growth; protecting paint 
films, especially exterior paints, from attack by fungi which occurs during 
weathering of the paint film; protecting processing equipment from slime deposits 
during manufacture of cane and beet sugar;
