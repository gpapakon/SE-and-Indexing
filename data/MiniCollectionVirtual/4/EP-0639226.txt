<ABSTRACT>
A novel ribozyme, capable of selectively cleaving the bcr-abl mRNA of a cell containing the Philadelphia Chromosome, thereby blocking synthesis of BCR-ABL protein is provided. Methods for using the ribozyme for treating leukemia patients and methods of producing the ribozymes are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR TREATING LEUKEMIASThis invention refers generally to the treatment of cancers, and more specifically to methods for treating leukemias characterized by the presence of a chimeric protein such as those produced by a genetic translocation.Background of the InventionPhiladelphia chromosome is a hybrid chromosome resulting from a chromosomal translocation in which a small portion of the long arm of chromosome 9 is transferred to the long arm of chromosome 22. This chromosomal abnormality consistently associates with human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) . CML is a disorder of hematopoietic cells which results in marked proliferation of granulocytic cells and often megakaryocytes.Recent studies indicate that more than 95% of CML patients as well as 15-25% of ALL (Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia) patients harbor Philadelphia Chromosome which is designated as Ph+. Molecular studies by several 

groups demonstrate that during the formation ofPhiladelphia Chromosome, a portion of the c-abl gene is translocated from chromosome 9q34 to chromosome 22qll.Significantly, this translocation disrupts two genes, c-r_ abl of chromosome 9 and the ber gene of chromosome 22, resulting in the generation of a new, fused gene comprising portions of ber and c-abl.This chimeric gene, termed bcr-abl , produces a new protein, BCR-ABL which has several unique properties and appears to be the causative agent of the cancers with which it is associated (See Fig. 1) . BCR-ABL protein is present only in tumor cells and its synthesis in these tumor cells is believed to be related to tumorigenicity. Presently CML and ALL patients are treated chemotherapeutically with conventional therapeutics and radiation. Such treatment is plagued by well-known side- effects and is often of limited effect. No effective treatment for these leukemias is known. Thus, other compositions and methods for treating such cancers are being sought.Certain naturally occurring RNA molecules, called ribozymes, possess the property of self-catalyzed cleavage. This reaction is shared by a number of small circular molecules which replicate in plants, either viroid RNAs, such as the avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBV) or satellite RNAs which are dependent on helper viruses, 

 such as the satellite RNAs of tobacco ringpost virus and lucerne transient streak virus [Haseloff et al, Nature, 334:585-591 (1988)].Comparison of several self-cleaving RNA sequences has led to the identification of a consensus secondary structure, termed "hammerhead*1, containing IlÂ¬ ls

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A synthetic RNA molecule useful for the treatment of a leukemia characterized by the presence of a hybrid oncogene resulting from a chromosomal translocation comprising a single strand of ribonucleic acids comprising a sequence complementary to a sequence of the coding strand of the hybrid gene 5' to the breakpoint of the translocation and capable of hybridizing thereto, a second sequence complementary to a sequence of the coding strand of the hybrid gene 3 ' to the breakpoint of the translocation and capable of hybridizing thereto, and a sequence therebetween encoding a ribozyme capable of cleaving the hybrid gene at or near the breakpoint, thereby blocking synthesis of the tumorigenic protein.
2. The RNA molecule according to claim 1 comprising the nucleotide sequence:
