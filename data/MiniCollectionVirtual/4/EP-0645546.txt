<ABSTRACT>
The metallic guide element (1) for a fastening element, which can be driven into hard receiving materials by means of a powder-power-operated setting unit, has a through-passage opening (2) into which at least three convex, plastically deformable guide regions (3) project. This ensures, on the one hand, sufficient guidance of the fastening element and on the other hand, unobstructed deformation of the guide regions (3).

<CLAIMS>
Metallic guide element (1, 10) for a fastening element (12) which 
is driven by means of an explosively actuated setting tool into 

hard receiving materials (14), with a passage opening (2, 15) 
comprising at least three plastically deformable guide areas (3), 

which are convex and extend into the passage (2, 15) 
perpendicularly to its main axis, for the purpose of guiding the 

fastening element (12), 
characterised in that
 the guide areas 
(3) are bulged along their extent parallel to the main axis. 
Guide element according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
guide areas (3) are arranged on the same plane which extends 

perpendicularly to the main axis of the passage opening (2, 15). 
Guide element according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 
the ratio of the smallest radial extent (R1) between the centre of 

the passage opening (2) and the guide area (3) to the largest 
radial extent (R2) between the centre of the passage opening 

(2) and the portion of the passage opening which is the farthest 
away from the centre of the passage opening (2) lies between 

1:1.1 and 1:1.8. 
Guide element according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the guide element (10) is integrated with the support 
element.
