<ABSTRACT>
A navigation system to be mounted on a vehicle for carrying 
out a route search and displaying the searched route. 

Traffic jam information and the like are obtained by an beacon 
receiver and an input part inputs time as a dri
ving condition. 
An ECU executes a predetermined calculation based on map data 

of a CD-ROM and traffic jam data and to obtain a range and 
routes reachable within the input time and to display the 

same. In case of residual fuel as a condition, the reachable 
range by this fuel is displayed. A display of gasoline stands 

as information for expanding reachability is also executed. 
Hence, a driver can plan a driving based on these information. 

Also, a reachable range within 2 hours is displayed and the 
use of railways is guided when the driver cannot reach the 

destination within a predetermined time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a navigation system to be mounted on vehicles for giving necessary information to a driver before and during driving.A variety of equipment has heretofore been proposed for giving necessary information to a driver and offering the promise of comfortable driving. As one example of such equipment, a navigation system is well-known and has been installed on various kinds of vehicles. Also, various kinds of navigation systems have been developed, for example, one which simply displays map information on a display, another one exhibiting a present position of a driver's own vehicle on a map, and a further one which not only searches for the shortest route from a present position to a destination and displays it on a map, but also continuously guides along driven routes, together with indicating the present position of a vehicle while driving. By using such a navigation system, the driver can readily recognize the route up to the destination and the driver's load when driving can be reduced.Document DE-A-40 34 681 discloses a traffic information inter-vehicle transference and navigation system wherein a data exchange between vehicles is carried out by remotely transmitting data related to speed and path. Furthermore, sensor data of moving direction and displacement of the vehicle are evaluated. A navigation module provides functions of path indication, driving forecast and speed-control instruction. In combination with the path indication the estimated arriving-time, the corresponding amount of fuel as well as the mileage still left is displayed to inform the driver of the current operating conditions of the engine and the progress to reach the precalculated destination.Moreover, document EP-A-0 286 105 discloses an automobile driving guide operatus wherein a guiding operation is performed on the basis of data transmission between the guide apparatus and an information service center. A memory means stores information of objective points related to the driver's destination point. A plurality of objective points is read out of the memory means in consideration of a specific purpose of use defined by the driver and a road map including the particular objective point is displayed on a display means. The driver can recognize the path as far as the selected objective point upon the displayed map and can determine the conditions to reach the objective point as specified beforehand.Further, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 2-278116, a navigation system displaying the

<CLAIMS>
A navigation system to be mounted on a vehicle for carrying out a route search on the basis of map information and displaying the searched route, comprising:

reachable place estimating means for estimating any place reachable on a road network in any direction from the present position under a predetermined condition; and
display means for displaying the reachable places estimated,

wherein the display of said reachable places in the display means is a display of a reachable range on a map defined by said reachable places, and
wherein the predetermined condition in said reachable place estimating means is time and said range reachable in a fixed time from the present position is displayed, said range being defined by the reachable places.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein the predetermined condition in said reachable place estimating means further includes a kind of destination reachable within a set time.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein the display of said reachable places in the display means is a display of said road network on a map.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein the display of the reachable places in the display means includes a display of reachable points.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein the display of the reachable places in the display means includes a changing of a reduction scale of a display map on the basis of a distance to at least one reachable point.
The navigation system of claim 4, wherein the display of the reachable points in the display means is a display of a plurality of points determined in order of reachability.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein the reachable places in the reachable place estimating means are corrected at any time on the basis of dynamic information received while driving.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein

reachable place expanding information receiving means is provided, for receiving reachable place expanding information for expanding the reachable places obtained; and said
display means displays the reachable places estimated and the reachable place increasing information received.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein

input means is provided for inputting a destination and various user instructions; and

said reachable place estimating means estimates said reachable places from said present position up to the input destination under said predetermined condition.
The navigation system of claim 1, wherein

input means is provided for inputting a destination;

reachable place expanding information receiving means is provided for receiving reachable place expanding information for expanding the reachability obtained; and said

display means displays the reachable places estimated and the reachable place expanding information received.
The navigation system of claim 10, wherein the reachable place expanding information in said reachable place expanding information receiving means is information about alternative transportation.
The navigation system of claim 10, wherein the reachable places in said reachable place estimating means are corrected at any time on the basis of dynamic information changing at all times in a driving.
