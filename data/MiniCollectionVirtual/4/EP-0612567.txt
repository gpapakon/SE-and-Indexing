<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a burner head for burner units, with a single- or multiple-injector gas-mixing system for the internal and/or external mixing of various combustion components, especially fuel gases, auxiliary combustion gases and, if required, liquid combustibles, formed by an intermediate piece in which there are feed ducts for the combustion components from one apparatus connection surface to a nozzle connection side, and with a nozzle which consists of a central part with ducts and of at least one union part, in which, for the purpose of mixing at least two combustion components, the circumferentially distributed first ducts assigned to a first combustion component open into first injector-nozzle holes which, for their part, are connected to a radial injector gap formed by an annular gap between the central part and the union part, and in which the circumferentially distributed second ducts assigned to the second combustion component likewise open into the radial injector gap, and in which radial/axial pressure compensation chambers circumferentially distributed in the intermediate piece are connected, on the one hand, to the individual distributor grooves and, on the other hand, to the associated feed ducts for the various combustion components, and in which the union part is preferably provided with nozzle ducts aligned with the injector-nozzle holes in the installed position and completely covers the central part towards the front end of the burner head pointing towards the flame, except for an additional injection guide duct which may be provided.
