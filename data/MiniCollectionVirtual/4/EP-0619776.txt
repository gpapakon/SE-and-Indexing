<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium employing a thin layer of nonmagnetic material (22) separating a soft magnetic layer (18) and a relatively thicker magnetic recording layer (16) is disclosed. The magnetic recording medium may incorporate conventional magnetic recording materials with the thin nonmagnetic layer (22) being silicon, chromium or carbon. The magnetic recording medium may be prepared by sputtering or other vapor deposition methods. A method for preparing a magnetic recording medium according to the present invention deposits the magnetic recording layer (16) either directly on a substrate (12), or, optionally, on a nucleating layer (14). The thin nonmagnetic layer (22) separates the magnetic recording layer (16) from the soft magnetic layer (18). A protective layer (20) overlies the soft magnetic layer (18). The deposition is achieved under conditions that maintain integrity of the magnetic recording layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIA EMPLOYING SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIALBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to magnetic recording media, and more specifically, to multilayered horizor^al recording media incorporating a highly magnetically permeable material.Description of the Related ArtConventional recording media include magnetic recording disks, tapes and "floppy" disks and typically have a multiple layer configuration. The base of a magnetic recording medium is a substrate, commonly a nickel-phosphorus-plated aluminum disk or thermoplastic tape or film, mechanically supporting one or more layers of magnetic material. Finally, a protective layer may be provided to prevent abrasion of the magnetic material by the magnetic head, or corrosion.Data is stored magnetically on recording media by creating, with a magnetic head and a current, a pattern of magnetization zones within the magnetic layer. Zone boundaries, defined by magnetic flux reversals within the magnetic layer, represent the data. The amount of data stored therefore depends in great part on the ability of 

 the magnetic material to support distinct, closely spaced lux reversals.Magnetic materials may be characterized according to the orientation of the easy axis of magnetization. This orientation is the direction within the crystalline structure of the magnetic material that minimizes the energy density associated with the orientation of magnetic dipoles in the magnetic layer. For vertical recording media, the easy axis of magnetization is perpendicular to the surface of the layer of magnetic material. For horizontal recording media, the easy axis of magnetization is parallel to the surface of the magnetic layer. Horizontal recording media currently in use in conventional disk drives typically achieve linear bit densities on the order of 45,000 flux changes per inch (45 kfci) .Vertical recording materials promise even higher density recording since theoretically more data may be packed in a pattern of magnetization zones perpendicular to the surface of the magnetic recording layer as opposed to in the plane of the layer, as in horizontal recording media. However, because of difficulties in the commercial development of productive magnetic recording disks incorporating vertical recording materials, horizontal recording materials remain of great commercial significance.Selection of a suitable magnetic material may be" aided by reference to the hysteresis or "BH" loop for the material produced by an applied
