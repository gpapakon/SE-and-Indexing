<CLAIMS>
A method for the temporary stabilization by adhesive bonding of a ballast
bed for railway tracks for the period of rehabilitation or reconstruction of a

parallel rail track, 
characterized in that
 a multi-component adhesive is applied
only to the lateral region of the ballast bed in such an amount that

there is anchorage down to the subsoil and yet the hollow spaces are not
filled, so that the bonding can later be disrupted mechanically again without

adversely affecting the reuse of the ballast material, wherein the components
of said adhesive are fed to a mixing chamber in a spatially separated

manner under a pressure of from 30 to 200 bar, mixed in said mixing
chamber with turbulent mixing, and the mixture is applied to the ballast bed

under a pressure of from 2 to 6 bar in laminar flow in the form of a flat curtain-like
film.
The method according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 not using any solvents.
