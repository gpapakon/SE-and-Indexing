<CLAIMS>
The use of dialkyl ethers for preventing fatty spew 
on leather, characterized in that dialkyl ethers with a 

pour point below 6°C which correspond to general formula 
(II): 


R³-O-R⁴
 
in which R³ and R⁴ independently of one another represent 

an alkyl group containing 1 to 32 and, more particularly 
7 to 22 carbon atoms, the alkyl groups optionally being 

saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, with the 
proviso that the total number of carbon atoms per ether 

molecule is in the range from 14 to 36,
 
are used in the oiling of leather. 
A fatty spew inhibiting composition containing an 
oiling component and a fatty spew inhibiting additive, 

characterized in that the additive is a dialkyl ether 
with a pour point below 6°C which corresponds to general 

formula (II): 

R³-O-R⁴
 
in which R³ and R⁴ independently of one another represent 

an alkyl group containing 1 to 32 and, more particularly 
7 to 22 carbon atoms, the alkyl groups optionally being 

saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, with the 
proviso that the total number of carbon atoms per ether 

molecule is in the range from 14 to 36. 
A composition as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that the oiling component is a neutral fat. 
A process for oiling leather in which tanned leather 
is treated with an oiling component and a fatty spew 

inhibiting additive, characterized in that the additive 
is a dialkyl ether with a pour point below 6°C which  

 
corresponds to general formula (II) : 


R³-O-R⁴
 
in which R³ and R⁴ independently of one another represent 

an alkyl group containing 1 to 32 and, more particularly 
7 to 22 carbon atoms, the alkyl groups optionally being 

saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, with the 
proviso that the total number of carbon atoms per ether 

molecule is in the range from 14 to 36. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that a neutral fat is predominantly used as the oiling 

component. 
A process as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that chrome-tanned leather is used.
