<ABSTRACT>
A raster scanner (60) is disclosed which utilizes a rotatable glass plate (64) for 
compensating for scan line bow. The rotatable glass plate (64) provides an adjustment 

mechanism which can shift a collimated light beam up or down in the sagittal plane to align 
the center ray of the light beam with the optical axis of the imaging lens of post polygon optics. 

When the center ray of the light beam passes over the optical axis of the imaging lens of the 
post polygon optic, the bow will be reduced substantially.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a raster scanner and, more particularly, to a raster scanner
system which utilizes an optical element for compensating a bow of a scan line.US-A-5 153 608 discloses a skew and bow correction system for an image scanner. The
system includes an optical element with an axis along the line of beam scanning. The principal
plane of the optical element is positioned at a first angle at the midpoint of the line of beam
scanning, and is oriented at a twist angle at each end of the scan line.JP-A2-4287011 discloses an optical scanning system that includes two flat plate glasses
between a cylindrical lens and a polygon mirror; the plate glasses are rotatable around an axis
perpendicular to a subscanning direction. Axis alignment in the subscanning direction is obtainable
by adjusting the angle of one flat plate glass.According to the present invention there is provided a raster scanner as defined in any
one of the appended claims.The present invention will be described further, by way of examples, with reference to the
accompanying drawings wherein:
Figure 1 is a top view of a prior art raster output scanner;Figure 2 shows a bow of a scan line situated downward which is called a frown; Figure 3 shows a bow of a scan line situated upward which is called a smile;Figure 4 shows a sagittal view of a correct path of a light beam through a prior art raster
scanner;Figure 5 shows an example of an error which has been introduced by a laser diode of a
prior art raster scanner;Figure 6 shows the raster scanner of an embodiment of this invention correcting the error
illustrated in Figure 5 which is introduced by the laser diode;Figure 7 shows the bow of the scan line of Figure 2 after it has been reduced by the raster
scanner of the embodiment of this invention; Figure 8 shows the bow of the scan line of Figure 3 after it has been reduced by the raster
scanner of the embodiment of this invention; and Figure 9 shows the raster scanner of an embodiment of this invention correcting an error
which is introduced by the post polygon optics.  Referring to Figure 1, a conventional raster scanner system 10 utilizes a light source 12, a
collimator 14, pre-polygon optics 16, a multi-faceted rotating polygon mirror 18 as the scanning
element, post polygon optics 20 and a photosensitive medium 22. The light source 12, which can
be a laser source, produces a light beam 24 and sends it to the rotating polygon mirror 18 through
the collimator 14 and the pre-polygon optics 16. The collimator 14 collimates the light
