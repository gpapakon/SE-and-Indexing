<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector component assembly (20) 
terminates discrete conductors of a multiconductor data 

cable (10). The component assembly includes an insulative 
component housing (22, 24) having a mating end for 

engagement with a mating electrical connection device and a 
cable receiving end for terminating the multiconductor 

cable. A plurality of electrical contacts (26, 28) are 
supported by the component housing. Each of the contacts 

has a conductor terminating end (26b, 28b) and a mating 

connection end. The contacts are supported in the component 
housing in a pair of horizontally extending, vertically 

spaced rows with each contact of one row being aligned with 
a respective contact of the other row. The contacts of one 

row are directly electrically shunted to the aligned 
contacts of the other row.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in 
electrical connector components. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to an electrical connector for 
terminating a multiconductor cable having vertically aligned 
connector components. In transmitting data signals, electrical 
connectors are commonly used to terminate signal carrying 
multiconductor electrical cables which interconnect the 
various components of the data system. Many data systems 
require the components to be supported in an electrically 
closed loop. A closed-loop system provides for continuity 
of signal in a multicomponent system when certain of the 
components are not interconnected. In order to achieve such a closed loop when the 
components are frequently connected and disconnected, the 
connectors connecting such components use automatic shunting 
mechanisms so that a closed-loop connection is maintained 
even when the connector is in a non-connected condition. 
The use of such shunting connectors in a closed-loop data 
system is shown in numerous patents including: Re. 32,760, 
4,449,778, 4,501,459, 4,508,415, 4,582,376, 4,602,833, 
4,619,494, 4,641,906, 4,653,825, 4,671,599, 4,682,836, 
4,711,507, 4,711,511, 4,731,032, 4,744,769, 4,859,201, 
4,883,433, 4,884,981, 4,891,022, 5,030,114, 5,030,121, 
5,035,647, 5,052,940, 5,074,803, 5,088,934, 5,104,337, 
5,112,243, 5,122,076 and 5,169,346. While the connectors shown in the above-identified 
patents provide adequately for the connection of components 
in a data system, the increasing use of smaller components 
in such systems requires the use of smaller connectors. 
However, despite the reduction in size, these connectors 
still must provide closed loop connections.  
 DE-A-4032800 discloses a connector comprising an 
insulative component housing having a mating end for 
engagement with a mating electrical connection device, a 
plurality of electrical contacts supported by the component 
housing, the contacts having mating connection ends and pins 
extending through the housing, and shunting means for 
electrically shunting the contacts. However, the contact 
mating connection ends are arranged in a single horizontal 
row. It is, therefore, desirable to provide a data 
connector of reduced size, which provides adequate shunting 
to maintain closed-loop connections. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an improved electrical data connector. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide data connector components of reduced size which
