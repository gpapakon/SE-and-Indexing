<ABSTRACT>
A fast operating, combined packet (53) and circuit (43) switch (33). The switch includes a number of units (45, 85, 61, 57) which are distributed locally and which are mutually connected by means of physical links (67, 129, 63). The invention is characterized in that in a packet-switched network, which is comprised of packet handlers (51, 55) and the links, each connected unit disposes over at least one control-time-slot. In this way, each unit is able to operate the circuit switch (43) so as, for instance, to establish and release circuit-switched connections, in response to control commands transmitted on the packet-switched network. As a result of the packet switch (53), the whole of the switch (33) can be configured at a cold start and during operation, therewith satisfying the individual bandwidth requirement of each connected unit (65, 57, 61, 85).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fast operating
switch for establishing connections between a plurality
of units which are distributed locally within a
system and which are mutually connected by means of
physical links. One of these units, called the switch
core, includes a known circuit switch for establishing
circuit-switched connections. The circuit switch includes
incoming ports, outgoing ports and control
memories which define which of the incoming ports
shall be connected to which of the outgoing ports in
establishing the routes of the circuit-switched connections
through the switch. The circuit switch is of
the TS-type (Time Space type) and includes the same
number of control memories as the number of links
connected to the switch core. The circuit switch also
includes switch memories which are utilized to connect
the incoming port of a connection to the outgoing port
of the same connection. The number of switch memories
present equals the number of links squared.The inventive switch can also be used as a digital
cross-connector.In the case of one known telecommunication network,
the terminal units are connected to the switch by
means of a number of links. Various means, such as
subscriber lines, tone-code receiving circuits, ring
generators, etc., are connected to the terminal units.
A regional processor monitors several terminal units
and is connected to said units via separate signal
lines. Another regional processor monitors other 
terminal units and is connected with these units via
separate signal lines. Thus, the system includes a
number of regional processors which monitor the activity
of the terminal units. A regional processor also
monitors the activity of the switch. The regional
processors are connected by means of a signal bus line
to a main central processor which controls the telecommunication
network and which also controls the
establishment of a connection through the switch on
the basis of a subscriber-number list stored in the
memory of the central processor. When a connection is
to be established between two subscribers, line signalling
is effected via the aforesaid signal lines,
also called signal links, whereas the actual transfer
of information, i.e. speech in the case of a speech
connection or the transmission of digital data when
two computers communicate with each other, is effected
via those links which enter the switch from respective
terminal units.Each terminal unit has a local processor which monitors
the activity of the devices or means connected to
the terminal
