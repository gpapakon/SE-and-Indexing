<ABSTRACT>
An improved cutting insert with chip control 
features and a method for manufacturing the same. An 

insert body having wall regions, sides and top and 
bottom walls is adapted for mounting in a pocket in a 

holder. The insert body has cutting edges and a 
diagonal notch in the top and bottom sides. A land 

region extends rearwardly from the end wall region 
toward the respective top or bottom wall and defines a 

surface region of a predetermined width. A descending 
wall initiates in a portion of the land and terminates 

in a planar floor region having a forward, a rearward 
and opposed side edges. A back ramp extends upwardly 

from the planar floor rearward edge and terminates at 
the respective top or bottom wall. The end wall region 

can include at least one flat land region adjacent the 
land region. The flat land region defines a 

selectively removable portion of the end wall region 
and after any selective removal thereof represents no 

more than approximately one-third of the total width of 
the end wall region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to cutting inserts,
especially metal cutting inserts with chip control, according
to the preamble of claim 1 (US-A-3,754,309).Cutting inserts are well known and a large
percentage of them are of the throw away design. Such
inserts are detachably clamped on a holder and then are
discarded when they become dull or chipped. Throw away
inserts are usually indexable and often are reversible
so that an insert can be provided with at least two
cutting edges for selective presentation to the cutting
position.The provision of two or more cutting edges on
the insert makes it economical to use and is
particularly important with respect to throw away
inserts because of the high cost of the materials from
which the inserts are produced, especially when the
material is, for example, a cemented metal carbide.The inserts must be securely and accurately
held in place within an insert holder during the
cutting operation. This is especially true when the
inserts are employed with numerically controlled
machines which depend for accuracy upon an accurately
located and firmly supported insert. When the inserts
are of a substantial area, it is possible to fix the 
insert both accurately and firmly within the pocket of
a toolholder by providing the insert with a central
hole and the toolholder with a pin-type clamping
device. In other cases, such inserts may be held in
place by a top clamp. Examples of such holders are
found in U. S. Patents No. 3,754,309; 3,399,442 and
3,762,005 and British Patent Specification 1,363,542.The main object of metal machining is the
shaping of the new work surface. Much attention is
paid to the formation of the chip during the machining
process, even though the chip is a waste product. This
is because the consumption of energy occurs mainly in
the formation and movement of the chip. Thus an
essential feature of any metalcutting operation is
effective chip control. A principal class of chips is
the discontinuous chip which has the practical
advantage of being easily cleared from the cutting
area. While some metals and alloys generate
discontinuous chips during cutting operations, many do
not. It is therefore very desirable to produce
discontinuous chips during a cutting operation,
regardless of the metal or alloy of the workpiece.It has been a common practice to place a
mechanical chip breaking member between the insert and
the clamp securing the insert to the tool in order to
provide at least a degree of chip control during the
cutting operation. This arrangement

<CLAIMS>
A cutting insert (110) with chip control
features having an insert body (112) having end wall

regions (114) and sides (118,120) and top (122) and
bottom (124) walls perpendicular to said sides (118,120)

and adapted for mounting in a pocket (74) of a toolholder
(70) with one end region (114) exposed, said insert body

(112) being invertible about an axis perpendicular to
said sides (118,120) thereof, said insert body (112)

having cutting edges (126) at the junctures of said top
(122) and bottom walls and respective ones of said end

wall regions (114), whereby in each inverted position of
said insert body (112) a respective cutting edge (126) is

presented uppermost at the same end of the insert body
(112), said top (122) and bottom walls of the insert body

(112) defining a notch (30) therein wherein the
improvement is comprised of said insert further having:


a land region (134) extending rearwardly from
said end wall region (114) toward said respective top

(122) or bottom wall and defining a surface region (138)
of a predetermined width proximate thereto; a descending

wall (140) initiating in a portion of said land region
(134) and terminating in a planar floor having a forward

(52), a rearward (54) and opposed side edges (56,58) and
wherein said descending wall (140) terminates at said

planar floor's forward (52) and opposed side edges

region (114), whereby the overall width of said end wall 
region (114) is reducible by the selective removal of at
