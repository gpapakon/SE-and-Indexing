<ABSTRACT>
A process for background information recovery in an 
image including an image of a moving object, comprises 

the steps of identifying regions of moving objects 
relative to the background; deriving a moving 

constellation containing moving objects in a minimum 
circumscribing polygon; deriving partial background 

images associated with respective positions of the moving 
constellation; and combining ones of the partial 

background images.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates generally to vision
technology and more particularly to background recovery
and motion estimation.Motion estimation has been an important goal in
vision technology for many years. See, for example, R.

process," IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Machine Intell.,
vol. 1, No. 5, pp. 489-503, Sept. 1981, mentioned above;

Homogeneous Framework for Visual Recognition,"
Proceedings, IJCAI, 1578-1584, 1989. A number of techniques have been developed to
extract and represent object motion in short-range or
long-range. However, most techniques can hardly be
integrated in a homogeneous frame since the
correspondence problem in motion estimation requires
either intensive computation for a generalized approach,
such as contour motion, as for example, E. Hildreth, The
measurement of visual motion MIT Press, Cambridge MA.
1984, or image flow in short-range motion; see for
example, B. K.P. Horn and B. G. Schunk, "Determining
optical flow," Artificial Intelligence 17, 185-203,
1981 or extra constraints for feature-based matching in
long-range motion. See, for example, D. T. Lawton and C.
C. McConnel, "Image Understanding Environments," IEEE
Proc., vol. 76, No. 8. 1036-1050, August 1988 .Similar work has been done in many different places.
Precision is the result of intensive computation in
classical estimation techniques. See, e.g. J. Barron,

image velocity information," Technical

the image sequence including an image of at least one moving
object against a background, comprising the steps performed on

said image frames of said image sequence of:

a) identifying a region of an image frame (im1) containing
an object moving relative to the background;
b) deriving a moving constellation (McG) corresponding to
the identified region from a comparison between the image

frame (im1) and a preceding image frame (im0);
c) deriving a partial background image frame by excluding
from the input image the area covered by the moving

constellation; and
d) recovering background information (BgR);
characterised in that
 said moving constellation is derived in

are binarized to obtain a bounding box frame, and the
