<ABSTRACT>
A linear motor is operated as an m-phase linear pulse 
motor or a brushless DC linear motor capable of producing 

large driving force. The linear motor includes an even 
number N of salient poles 11, 12, ... disposed at an equal 

pitch angle and includes a stator 1 having a plurality of 
permanent magnet poles disposed on inner peripheral surfaces 

of the salient poles to have polarities different from each 
other in the shaft direction and a mover 3 disposed movably 

in the shaft direction. The salient poles are constituted by 
pairs of the salient poles adjacent to each other and include 

m sets of salient pole groups each composed of (N/m) salient 
poles disposed at an angle of (720m/N) degrees and windings 

W1, W2, ... wound on 

(N/m)-1 
 
 or 


(N/m)-2 
 
 salient poles 

belonging to the salient pole groups are connected to have 
opposite polarities between the pair of salient poles and are 

connected to have the same polarity between the salient poles 
which do not constitute the pair of salient poles and are 

disposed to interpose the salient poles for the other phase 
to constitute phase windings for m phases. Remaining salient 

poles of the salient pole group are caused to detect a 
position and a movement direction of the mover 3 as sensor 

poles S

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a linear motor, and more 
particularly to a linear motor operating as a two-phase and a 
multi-phase linear pulse motor or a brushless DC linear motor. In the US 5,179,306, a linear motor and method of using 
said motor for producing a sufficient reciprocating thrusting 
action to enable well fluids be pumped through the production 
tubing of a well to the ground surface is described. The 
motor is a 3-phase PM type cylindrical linear motor including 
a mover and a stator, said stator including a set of coils for 
producing a series of electromagnetic field extending at least 
partially in an axial direction when energized with an 
electric current and a stator core defining a plurality of 
spaced-apart transversely disposed coil receiving slots and an 
annular axially extending mover receiving bore. In the Japanese provisional utility model publication no. 
63-191878, an example of inductor of a PM disc linear stepping 
motor is described. In this linear stepping motor, the stator 
consists of poly-phase electromagnets, and permanent magnets 
made of thin plates are attached to the pole surface facing 
the mover and the polarity of adjacent magnetic motive force 
of the permanent magnets is different from each other. The 
teeth of the mover are arranged in line in the moving 
direction at the pitch of the teeth equivalent to the pole 
pitch of the poles of the permanent magnets of the stator. 
The electromagnets of the stator are arranged in line at equal 
intervals in the direction of movement of the mover for an 
integer multiply of the number of the phases. The positions 
of the pole of the permanent magnets attached to the 
electromagnets of the phases are mutually shifted for 
360°/phase.  
 Fig. 11 is a longitudinal sectional view illustrating a 
permanent magnet type cylindrical linear motor of a related 
art. In Fig. 11, a stator core 101 of a stator 100 of the 
permanent magnet type cylindrical linear motor includes a 
ring-like yoke portion having a small inner diameter and 
forming ring-like stator tooth tops 102a and a ring-like yoke 
portion having a large inner diameter and forming ring-like 
stator tooth bottoms 102b, both the yoke portions being 
laminated alternately in the shaft direction. Thus, stator 
teeth 102 composed of a number of ring-like tooth tops 102a 
and ring-like tooth bottoms (grooves) 102b are formed in the 
inner peripheral surface of the stator core 101 at equal 
pitches in the shaft direction. Ring-like windings 103, 104, ... are
