<ABSTRACT>
A soil cultivating machine (2) comprising a frame, 
soil working members and a roller (4) which extends through 

approximately the full working width of the machine (2), the 
roller (4) being assembled from a plurality of roller 

elements (18) of a length considerably less than half the 
length of the roller (4), and which elements are rotatable 

about a shaft which is arranged at an angle to the 
longitudinal direction of the roller (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soil cultivating
machine, in particular a rotary harrow, comprising a frame,
soil working members, more particularly power driven
rotatable soil working members, and a roller which extends
through approximately the full working width of the machine,
said roller being coupled adjustably in height to the frame
by means of arms, such that at least part of the weight of
the machine may be carried and which is assembled from a
plurality of elements of a length which is considerably less
than half the length of the roller.Such a machine is known from the Dutch Patent
Application NL-A-7806736. The known machine is perfectly
suitable for pressing the worked soil in order to create a
homogeneous seed bed over the full width of the cylindrical
roller. It has the disadvantage that soil may stick to the
roller.From the French Patent Application no. 2 015 081
there is known a soil cultivating machine resting on the
ground by means of depth control wheels and comprising a
single practically cylindrical roller-like soil pressing
device, which is orientated under an angle of more than 90°
relative to the direction of operative travel. In this way
the soil pressing device is subjected to a rotational speed
differing from that corresponding to the forward motion of
the machine. Sticking of earth to the roller surface may
hereby be prevented. From the same document there is also
known a roller, couplable to a tractor and comprising a
plurality of roller elements which are each mounted to a
frame part of the roller and which are each arranged at an
angle to the longitudinal direction of said roller. The
latter roller may simply be pulled by a tractor and is
adapted for rolling soils without using a cultivating
machine. The German Offenlegungsschrift DE 34 25 194
discloses a plough fitted with a roller. The roller is
hingeably coupled to the plough by means of the parallelogram
structure and comprises two cylindrical roller elements of
approximately half the length of the roller. The roller
elements are arranged in the same position at an angle of
more than 90° relative to the direction of operative travel
of the machine, in order to encounter sidewardly directed
forces resulting from the plough.It is the object of the invention to arrive at a
machine of the kind mentioned before, however, at least less
prone to the mentioned disadvantage.According to the invention, the object is achieved
when the roller comprises a frame part extending in the
longitudinal direction of the roller between

<CLAIMS>
A soil cultivating machine (2), in particular a
rotary harrow, comprising a frame (8), soil working members,

more particularly power driven rotatable soil working members,
and a roller (4) which extends through approximately

the full working width of the machine, which by means of arms
(3) is coupled to the frame (8) adjustably in height, such

that at least part of the weight of the machine may be
carried and which is assembled from a plurality of elements

(18) of a length which is considerably less than half the
length of the roller (4), characterized in that the roller

comprises a frame part (16) extending in the longitudinal
direction of the roller between arms (3) thereof, to which

frame part (16) a plurality of roller elements is mounted,
these roller elements (18) being in the shape of a truncated

cone and wherein the roller (4) includes two mirror-inverted
halves, each having a number of roller elements (18), each of

said roller elements being rotatable about a shaft (20) which
is arranged at an angle to the longitudinal direction of the

roller. 
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that one or more roller elements (18) are

mounted adjustably and lockably about an upwardly directed
axis.
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in one or
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

roller (4) has a circumferential surface made of plate
material.
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in one or
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

roller (4) has a circumferential surface which is
predominantly formed by rod-like elements (38).
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in one or
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that, seen in

plan view, the roller elements (18) each have a leading
circumferential line which extends transversely to the

direction of operative travel A of the machine. 
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in one or
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

roller elements (18) are rotatable about approximately
horizontally extending shafts (56), in that the roller (4) is

freely rotatable and has a diameter of approximately 40 cms,
and in that two or more roller elements (18) are jointly

adjustable.
