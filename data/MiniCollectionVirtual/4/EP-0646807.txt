<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to MR imaging apparatus
using NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), and more
particularly to an MR imaging apparatus which acquires
images by a technique called hybrid scan.According to a basic method, a conventional MR
imaging apparatus executes a pulse sequence repeatedly.
In the pulse sequence, one echo signal (primary echo)
is generated by irradiating an examinee with one
excitation RF (Radio Frequency) pulse (also called 90°
pulse since it rotates the spin phase of protons 90°)
and then one refocus RF pulse (also called 180° pulse
since it rotates the spin phase of protons 180°).
Subsequently, the pulse sequence is repeated with
varied phase encoding amounts. Data acquired from the
echo signal generated in one pulse sequence are arranged
on one line in a raw data space (also called k
space). In order to obtain a raw data space having 256
lines, for example, the pulse sequence must be repeated
256 times with different phase encoding amounts according
to this basic method. Thus, data collection 
requires a time-consuming operation.In view of the above situation, what is known as
single-shot scan has been developed in which an
examinee is irradiated with one excitation RF pulse
(called a single shot), and data for all the lines in
the raw data space are acquired with this single shot.
The single-shot method includes a fast spin echo method
and EPI (Echo Planar Imaging). An apparatus using the latter method is described in US 4684891. The fast spin echo
method uses a pulse sequence called RARE (Rapid Acquisition
with Relaxation Enhancement) in which one
excitation RF pulse is followed by a plurality of (e.g.
256) refocus RF pulses to generate echo signals which
are subjected to different phase encoding. The echo
planar imaging uses a technique called gradient switching
in which one excitation pulse is followed by
alternate reversals of the polarity of gradient field
pulses effected plural times (e.g. 256 times) to
generate a plurality of echo signals which are subjected
to different phase encoding. However, the plurality
of echo signals generated by these methods attenuate
with time, and the later echo signal has the less
strength. A sectional image of poor quality is reconstructed
by arranging the data from these echo signals
on a plurality of lines in a raw data space.Then, a combination of the above basic method and 
single-shot scan method, known as hybrid scan method,
has been developed. This hybrid scan method will be
described, taking a combination of the basic method and
fast
