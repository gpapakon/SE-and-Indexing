<CLAIMS>
Clamping device consisting of two substantially 
parallel plates (1, 2) of which one at least may be 

driven in rotational movement about an axis (6) 
perpendicular to its surface, a plurality of guide 

cavities (13, 14, 15) hollowed out in at least one of 
these plates at a distance from the axis and a plurality 

of corresponding balls (3, 4, 5) inserted into the 
cavities and gripped between the two plates, each guide 

cavity forming a cam and providing a bearing surface (7) 
rising monotonically, covering a non-nil angle of the 

rotational movement, from a portion (7a) of maximum depth 
to the surface (1a) of the plate, characterized in that 

the portion (7a) of maximum depth of this cavity forms a 
housing for the corresponding ball, which holds it in a 

single determined position, and in that this cavity 
consists in a portion of lesser depth, of a ramp (7b) 

which intercepts the housing in a plurality of points of 
intersection (7c) in the direct vicinity of which, on the 

one hand, the ball forms a first slope tangent with the 
housing, and in the vicinity of which points, on the 

other hand, the ramp has a second slope which is 
substantially shallower than the first slope, said points 

of intersection thus being situated on a slope 
discontinuity. 
Clamping device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the housing adopts the shape of a 

portion of a sphere with a radius similar to that of the 
ball. 
Clamping device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the shape of the housing is at 

least partially conical.
