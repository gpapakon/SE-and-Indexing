<ABSTRACT>
A network port configurator device for automatically
configuring a system having network workstations and corresponding

network equipment of various physical protocols.
The network port configurator comprises a plurality

of input and output ports for receiving physical wiring to
which the workstations and network equipment are attached.

Detection circuitry attached to the input and output ports
determine the physical protocol of the attached workstations

and network equipment by determining a characteristic
of the attached equipment. Examples of identifying

characteristics include a characteristic impedance, a
characteristic voltage, and a characteristic cable identification

of the workstation. Logic circuitry uses this
information to control a circuit switching mechanism that

connects the input ports to the output ports.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the interconnection
of digital communications networks and, more particularly,
to a system for automatically connecting a network workstation
of a particular protocol type with network equipment
of the same protocol type.Rapid changes in digital communications networks have
generated a multiplicity of network types, many of which
co-exist. For example, many times both host-centric and
distributed communications networks are used within a
business environment. Each type of network has a useful
function necessary in many business environments.A host-centric communications network is one in which
all information transferred between connected devices is
managed by a central host processor unit. An example of a
host-centric network is one comprising a mainframe from
International Business Machines (IBM)« (such as a System/390«)
having a plurality of display terminals (such as
IBM 3270 Information Display Systems) connected via a
control unit (such as an IBM 3174 terminal controller).A distributed communications network is one in which
information is transferred between devices attached to the
network without the intervention of a central host processor.
These distributed networks can be constructed from 
local area network technologies, such as Ethernet (as
defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard) or token ring (IEEE
802.5 standard).The ad hoc development and deployment of the various
types of networks in earlier years has resulted in non-compatibility
for interconnection. Each network type has
its own protocols under which it operates and communicates
with other networks of the same protocol type. For instance,
a networking protocol may define the manner in
which the data is framed or in which errors are checked.
Furthermore, a networking protocol normally defines the
physical interface, or the actual physical connectivity
and medium used by the network. This physical interface
definition is analogous to the physical layer of the seven-layer
Open Systems Interface (OSI) reference model.
Examples are the use of unshielded twisted pair, coaxial
or fiber optic cabling for the transmission of bit streams
across the particular physical medium. Thus, a business
having multiple networks, each of a unique protocol, many
times has corresponding sets of wiring in its facility to
accommodate them.Currently, as multiple networks are installed in
facilities, the wiring and physical ports compatible with
each type of network physical interface also are installed.
That is, distinct sets of
