<ABSTRACT>
A power plant comprising a gas turbine module (1) and a steam turbine with high-pressure part (3A) with or without medium pressure (3B) and low-pressure part (5), which are mounted on the same line of shafts (2, 4, 6, 8) driving an alternator (7) arranged at the end of the shafts, the stator (1') of the gas turbine bearing on a base (17) which is solidly attached to a massive part (10) via supports (18, 19) having low translational stiffness and being solidly attached on the other hand to the fixed part by a stop (13) of the line of shafts, characterised in that the line of shafts (2, 4, 6, 8) is provided with a stop (9) whose fixed part is mounted on the massive part (10) and arranged between the two points (28 and 29) of fastening onto the massive part (10) of the stators (3') and (5') of the low-pressure part (5) and of the high-pressure part (3A), with or without medium pressure (3B). Decrease of expansions along the single shaft line and increase of efficiency.

<CLAIMS>
A power plant comprising a gas turbine module (1) and a steam
turbine having a high pressure portion (3A), and a low pressure

portion (5) mounted on the same shaft line (2, 4, 6, 8) that drives
an alternator (7) disposed at the end of the shaft line, the gas

turbine module (1) including a gas turbine stator (1') provided with
an air inlet (14) and with an exhaust (16) provided with a flexible

gasket (20) at its outlet, said gas turbine stator (1') being
supported by a base (17) secured to a foundation (10) by means of

supports (18, 19) having low stiffness in translation, and also being
secured to the stationary portion of an abutment (13) of the shaft

line, the high pressure portion (3A) of the steam turbine including a
high pressure stator (3') fixed to the foundation (10), and its low

pressure portion (5) including a low pressure stator (5') fixed to
the foundation (10) via a fixing point (28) that is situated at its

end that is remote from the alternator (7),

   characterized in that the high pressure stator (3') is fixed to
the foundation (10) via a fixing point (29) situated at its end that

is remote from the gas turbine module (1), and in that the shaft line
(2, 4, 6, 8) is provided with an abutment (9) whose stationary

portion is mounted on the foundation (10) and is disposed between the
said two fixing points (28 and 29).
A power plant according to claim 1, characterized in that the high
pressure portion (3A) includes a medium pressure portion (3B).
