<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of methylchlorosilanes by reacting comminuted silicon metal with methyl chloride in the presence of a copper-containing catalyst system and, if appropriate, other known additives. According to the invention, a catalyst system composed of copper(I) oxide, copper(II) oxide and metallic copper is employed, which contains at least 30 % by weight of metallic copper. The advantages of the invention are not only a high selectivity for dimethyldichlorosilane (improved T/D ratio) and high catalyst material productivity, but also a high proportion of 1,1,2-trichlorotrimethyldisilane in the higher-boiling by-products.

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing methyl chlorosilanes by converting comminuted silicon
metal with methyl chloride in the presence of a catalyst system consisting of cuprous

and cupric oxide and metallic copper, and possibly other known additives,
characterized in that the fraction of metallic copper in the catalyst system is 35.2 to

78.4 percent by weight.
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterized in that 2 to 10 parts by weight
of the catalyst system are used per 100 parts by weight of silicon.
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterized in that the catalyst system is
prepared by mechanical mixing.
