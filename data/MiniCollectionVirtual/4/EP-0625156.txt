<DESCRIPTION>
 [3H.7H]THIAZOLE[3,4-a]PYRIDINES HAVING ANTIASTHMATIC AND ANTIINFLAMMATORY ACTIVITIES ON THE RESPIRATORY TRACTThe present invention relates to [3H,7H]thiazole[3,4-aJpyridines, a process for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.More precisely, the invention relates to compounds of formula (I)
 wherein:R is (C1_c4) al yl;R-, is a cyano, free or salified carboxy, (Cι-C6) alkoxycarbonyl group or a group of formula-CONH(CH-) NR R. wherein q is an integer from 2 to 4;Ra is hydrogen, (C^-Cg) alkyl, benzyl; Rb is hydrogen or (Cι--Cg) alkyl or Rg and Rb, together with the nitrogen atom, form a pyrrolidino, piperidino, morpholino, 4-thiomorpholino, (C1-C4)-alkylpiperazino group;~2 is a (C3-C7)-cycloalkyl, o(-, β-, or ^-pyridyl, optionally substituted phenyl or a bicyclic ring in which a benzene ring is fused to a 5- or 6- membered 

heterocycle containing one or more heteroatoms selected from 0, S, N linked through the benzene ring;R- is hydrogen, a pharmaceutically acceptable cation or (C,-Cg) alkyl;A is a group of formula:h) (CH2-)n-NH—CO—i) -CH2-NH-CO-NRc-OHR. , R_ and R, are straight or branched (C,-C.) alkyl or one of them is hydrogen and the other are straight or branched ( C, -C . ) alkyl; or one of them is -CH NRaRb, being Ra, Rb as defined above; Re is (C-^-C.) alkyl; n 

 is zero or an integer from 1 to 3.A particularly preferred meaning for n is n=l.By "optionally substituted phenyl" we mean a phenyl ring containing from 1 to 3 substituents selected from (C-^Cg) alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl; (C1-C4)alkoxy such as methoxy, ethoxy or propoxy; (C1-c4)alkylthio such as methylthio, ethylthio; phenoxy; 4- hydroxyphenoxy; phenylthio; 4-hydroxyphenylthio; halogen atoms (chlorine, bromine or fluorine); cyano, azido, nitro, amino groups; (C,-Cg)acylamino; trihaloacetylamino such as trifluoroacetylamino; methane- or trifluoromethanesulfonamido; benzene- or para-tolylsulfonamido; trihalomethyl such as trichloro- or trifluoromethyl; dihalo ethoxy such as difluoromethoxy; trifluoromethoxy; free or salified carboxy; (C,_c4)alkoxycarbonyl.Particularly preferred mono and/or polysusbtituted phenyl groups are those bearing the following substi- tuents: 2-chloro-, 3-chloro-, 4-chloro-, 2,3-dichloro-,2-fluoro-, 2-fluoro-3-chloro-, 2-nitro-, 3-nitro, 3-ni- tro-4-phenoxy-, 4-nitro-, 4-nitro-3-phenoxy-, 2- trifluoromethyl-, 3-trifluoromethyl-, 3-cyano-, 3-me- thoxy-, 2-amino-, 3-amino-, 4-amino-, 2-methanesulfona- ido-, 3-methanesulfonamido-,
