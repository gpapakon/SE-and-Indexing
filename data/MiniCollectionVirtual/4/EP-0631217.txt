<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vacuum regulating device for apparatuses for measuring the low-temperature durability of a fuel containing paraffins, requiring a constant or time-varying pressure reduction, the device including an electronic control module and a pump. According to the invention, it comprises a means for selecting at least one suction setting means for the pump; a means of attenuating the suction setting means connected in particular to the filtration module; a means of measuring the pressure reduction generated by the pump; and a means of comparing the setting and the measurement and of modifying the voltage applied to the pump if necessary.
