<ABSTRACT>
Method for calibrating an image detector comprising sources (10) for illuminating a document (3) and photosensitive elements (16) for receiving the light reflected by the document, means (7) for compensating the output voltage of each photosensitive element (16), and means for varying the intensity of the light signal emitted by the associated source (10). It consists in presenting a white reference document to the image detector and, after having equalised the gains of the compensation means, in raising the intensity of the light of the sources until all the photosensitive elements (16) have bright responses, in increasing the attenuation with the aid of the compensation means (7) until the corresponding photosensitive element (16) again has a dark response, and in storing this attenuation to form a correction table (21).

Method for calibrating an image detector (1) of the type comprising, in a housing (9), a
set of sources of light (10) for lighting a data medium (3) to be analysed, and photosensitive

elements (16) to take the light from the corresponding sources reflected by the medium, by
means of compensation facilities (20, 21) in order to vary at least one of the parameters

comprising the output voltage of each photosensitive element (16), and the intensity of the light
signal emitted by the associated source (10), the method consisting in offering up to the image

detector a uniform sheet of datum white paper, and

a) after making the gains of the compensation facilities identical for each photosensitive
element, to vary the light emitted by the light sources (10) by increasing their luminous

intensity until all the photosensitive elements (16) have white responses;
b) at this fixed level of light and for each photosensitive element (16), to increase the level of
attenuation by means of those compensation facilities (20, 21) until the photosensitive element

(16) again has a black response, and to store these attenuation figures to form a table (21) for
correcting the image detector.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised by
 the fact that it consists, before varying
the light, in setting the response of each photosensitive element to a unit gain.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised by
 the fact that the increase in the level of
attenuation is assured overall for all the photosensitive elements of the image detector. 
Method according to one of the Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised by
 the fact that the
increase in the level of attenuation is assured separately for each photosensitive clement of the

image detector.
Method according to any one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by
 the fact that, in
addition, it consists in establishing by calculation a mean attenuation and/or a mean intensity of

light in relation to the quality of the image detector determined by the dispersion of the
responses of the photosensitive elements and in proceeding with calibration while changing the

value of the overall attenuation and/or of the light intensity to bring it to the said mean
attenuation and/or to the said mean light intensity.
Method according to any one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by
 the fact that, in
addition, it consists in standardising all the photosensitive elements of the image detector and in

applying values of attenuation, from a table, to the means of compensation (20, 21) so that all
the photosensitive elements of the image detector have identical values.
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterised by
 the fact that it consists in varying
individually, but for different values, the gain of each photosensitive element to constitute

virtual attenuations per step of x% so as to calibrate the image detector while retaining its
uniform response.
Method according to any one of the Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised by
 the fact that it
consists in using virtual levels of grey reconstituted to achieve an overall response curve for the

image detector and then in assuring smoothness of the points of the curve using the law of least
squares. 
Method according to any one of the Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised by
 the fact that it has a
phase of dynamic calculation of uniformity of the image detector consisting in calculating the

curves (a), (b) of the all white maxima and the all black minima of the photosensitive elements
of the image detector and in deducing from them by smoothing, using the law of least squares,

the equivalent uniformity curve (d).
