<ABSTRACT>
Lubricants having a viscosity suitable for a refrigeration lubricant as well as good miscibility with common refrigerants (including R-134a) comprise at least one oil corresponding to the formula DAm in which D is a deprotonated residue of a Michael doner, A is a monovalent group composed of n Michael acceptor moieties, m is an integer of at least one corresponding to the valence of D, and n is an integer of at least one, preferably an integer such that the sum of n moieties in the m monovalent A groups is at least three. The novel DAm oils and other novel DAm compounds in which the sum of n moieties in the m monovalent A groups is at least three can be prepared by (1) reacting at least one Michael donor with at least one Michael acceptor in the presence of a basic compound and a phase transfer catalyst until at least some of the product molecules contain at least three acceptor moieties and (2) if desired, then subjecting the product to one or more further reactions, such as transesterification, to alter its properties. Among the more preferred products are the ester oils in which the esterifying groups contain 1-30 carbons and which have viscosities such as to make them suitable for use as lubricants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to Michael addition products and to refrigeration
compositions containing such products as lubricants.The Michael reaction is a known process wherein a Michael acceptor (such
as an α,β-ethylenically-unsaturated aldehyde, ester, nitrite, ketone, sulfone, or sulfoxide)
is reacted with a Michael donor (such as a dialkyl malonate) to elongate a carbon chain.
U.S. Patent 2,396,626 (Wiest et al.) teaches that products useful as plasticizers or
solvents can be obtained by reacting two molecules of acrylonitrile, an alkyl acrylate,
or an acrylamide with a molecule of a donor, such as an ester, amide, or nitrile of
malonic acid, phenylacetic acid, cyanoacetic acid, or acetoacetic acid. However, as
indicated in Skarzewski, "The Michael Reaction of Methanetricarboxylic Esters. A
Simple Method for Two-Carbon Chain Elongation," Synthesis, December 1990, pp. 1125-1127,
it has usually been considered undesirable to add a donor molecule to more than
one acceptor molecule in such a reaction.It has now been found that a Michael reaction can be conducted so as to form
products containing 1-30 acceptor moieties/donor moiety, that oils thus produced have
utility as lubricants (especially refrigeration lubricants), and that other novel products
containing at least three acceptor moieties/donor moiety are also useful materials.Thus, the invention resides in (1) compositions according to claims 11 to 13 comprising a refrigerant and,
as a refrigeration lubricant, at least one oil of
(2) a novel mixture of compounds according to
claims 1 to 7,
and (3) a processes according to claims 8 to 10 for preparing the novel compounds. The Michael donors employed in
preparing the novel products are Z'-CH(E)(E") compounds wherein Z' is hydrogen
or an alkyl or cycloalkyl group of up to 10 carbons, E" is hydrogen or an electron
withdrawing group, and E is an electron withdrawing group ― the electron withdrawing
group or groups being any of those mentioned above but preferably being -COOR,
-C(O)R', and/or -CN groups in which R and R' are alkyl or cycloalkyl groups of up
to 10 carbons, preferably methyl or ethyl. The most preferred Michael donors are
the dimethyl and diethyl malonates; the methyl and ethyl cyanoacetates, chloroacetates,
acetoacetates, and propionylacetates; malononitrile; acetonitrile; acetylacetone; and
dipropionylmethane. The Michael acceptors are ordinarily CTT'=CT"G
compounds in which T, T, and T" are independently selected from hydrogen, G', and
organic groups (e.g., alkyl, alkoxyalkyl,
