<ABSTRACT>
An axial flow transonic turbofan jet 
engine includes a hub (26) from which radiate a 

plurality of rotor blades (50). A casing (12) 
surrounds and shrouds the rotor blades (50). Part-span 

dampers (56) are located between adjacent 
rotor blades (50) in an annular pattern to stiffen 

the elongated rotor blades (50) during operation. 
The distal tips (54) of the rotor blades (50) are 

convexed and spin within a rub strip (62) embedded 
within the casing (12). The rub strip (62) 

includes an annularly troughed contour (60) to 
closely conform with the convex tips (54) of the 

rotor blades (50). The hub (26) may also include 
an annularly troughed contour (60) formed along the 

roots (52) of the rotor blades (50). The annularly 
troughed contours (60) in the hub (26) and in the 

casing (12) are radially aligned with the part-span 
dampers (56) to reduce drag between the casing (12) 

and the hub (26) caused by the part-span dampers 
(56) at transonic speeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to axial 
flow transonic shrouded rotors, and more 
particularly to rotor blades for such shrouded 
rotors having part-span dampers. In shrouded rotor applications, it is 
frequently the case that spinning rotor blades are 
operated at exceptionally high rotational velocity. 
From an aerodynamic standpoint, high rotational 
velocities are not a particular concern when 
dealing with small diameter rotors. However, with 
larger diameter rotors, such as typically found in 
turbofan jet engines and steam turbines, large 
angular velocities can result in linear velocities 
at radially extended locations, e.g., at the rotor 
blade tips, which approach and even exceed the 
speed of sound in the particular fluid medium. 
These high local velocities at the tips of the 
rotor blades which approach or exceed the speed of 
sound are associated with an increase in drag due 
to a reduction in the total pressure through shock 
waves and due to thickening and even separation of 
the boundary layer due to the local but severe 
adverse pressure gradients caused by the shock 
waves.  
 In many shrouded rotor applications, 
e.g., the fan section of an axial flow turbofan jet 
engine, the rotor blades are stiffened by part-span 
dampers which circumferentially interconnect 
adjacent rotor blades thereby encircling the hub 
from which the rotor blades extend. Since many 
such shrouded rotor applications operate at 
exceptionally high rotational velocities, these 
large diameter rotor blades have a tendency to 
untwist as a result of the air pressures generated. 
In these instances, part-span dampers are 
particularly useful in rigidifying the rotor blades 
and dampening vibration. Typically, the part-span 
dampers are located between one-half and two-thirds 
distance from the hub. When the shrouded rotor is operated at 
transonic speeds, i.e., the linear velocity of the 
rotor blades relative to the freestream approaches 
and exceeds Mach 1.0, the physical presence of the 
part-span dampers in the flow path between the hub 
and the casing surrounding the rotor blades 
increases shock wave drag. Such drag has the net 
effect of reducing fuel efficiency in the case of 
turbofan jet engines. In such applications, 
approximately 50% of the available energy produced 
in the combustion process is required to operate 
the compressor section and large bypass fan 
section. Therefore, it will be appreciated that a 
reduction in shock wave drag will have a 
considerable effect on engine efficiencies.
