<ABSTRACT>
In one embodiment an insect body fluid is added to a 
solution isotonic to said insect body fluid, said 

solution containing a substance irreversibly inhibiting 
serine protease, and then an excess amount of said 

inhibiting substance is removed. 
In another embodiment an insect is injected with an 
isotonic solution for that particular insect said 

isotonic solution containing a substance irreversibly 
inhibiting serine protease, the insect body is cut and 

the body fluid which comes out is collected, and then an 
excess amount of said inhibiting substance is removed 

from said collected body fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The body fluid of insects can be collected, for
example, by the method disclosed by M. Ashida [Insect
Biochem., 11, 57-65 (1981)]. In the mentioned method
insects, for example, silkworm larvae, are anaesthetized
on ice, and physiological saline containing either sugar
including as an impurity cane sugar factor (polymeric
substances included in sugar cane and comprising for
example glucose, and amino acids), or cane sugar factor
itself is injected into the haemocoel (body cavity) of
the silkworm larvae. Then the larvae body is tied with a
fine thread so as to prevent exudation of the injected
saline. After being allowed to stand at room temperature
for about 20 minutes, a cut is made into a leg and the
body fluid is collected. The collected fluid is
centrifuged to remove blood cells, then dialysed, and
insect plasma is obtained.Insect Biochemistry, Volume 16, No. 3, 1968 at page
539 "Microbial activation of two serine enzymes and
prophenoloxidase in the plasma fraction of haemolymph of
the silkworm, Bombyx mori" (Yoshida et al) discloses a
method of obtaining insect body fluid including the step of
contacting the haemolymph with a saline solution containing
sugar and cane sugar factor, and subsequent dialysis of the haemolymph. In one embodiment, this invention provides a
process for collecting a body fluid from an insect which
comprises adding an insect body fluid to an isotonic
solution for the insect to be used which contains a
substance irreversibly inhibiting serine proteases, and
removing an excess amount of the inhibiting substance.In an alternative embodiment, this invention
provides a process for collecting a body fluid from an
insect which comprises;injecting into the insect an isotonic solution
for the insect to be used which contains a substance
irreversibly inhibiting serine proteases, cutting into a
part of the insect body, collecting the body fluid which
comes out and removing an excess amount of the inhibiting
substance. There is no limitation to the insects which can
be used in the process of this invention, but larger ones
with known rearing methods therefor are preferable.
Examples of such insects are Manduca serta, Gelleria
melonella, Hyalphoma ceropia, and Bombyx mori (silkmoth),
belonging to the Lepidoptera order; Sarcophaga
peregrina, and musca, belonging to the Diptera order;
Locusta, and migratoria Teleogryllus, belonging to the
Orthoptera order; and Cerambyx belonging to the
Coleoptera order.Hemolymph which is the body fluid obtained from
the body cavity is most easily obtained
