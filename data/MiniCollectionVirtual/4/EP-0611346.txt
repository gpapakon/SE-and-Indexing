A safety device for protecting the occupants of a 
vehicle, preferably passenger vehicle, in the event of 

a side-on collision, consisting of a restraining means 
(3, 34), integrated in the side region of the vehicle 

which in the event of a side-on collision can be 
clamped securely in front of the inside of the window 

opening (23) of the side region with the aid of an 
automatically triggered drive means (17, 37) by means 

of a traction mechanism (6, 7, 38), characterised by 
the combination with an airbag impact protection unit 

(25, 42) integrated in the side region of the vehicle, 
the airbag (26) of which unit, in the inflated state, 

lies between the restraining means (3, 34) clamped in 
front of the window opening (23, 40) and the occupants 

of the vehicle. 
A safety device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the restraining means (3, 34) 

consists of a flat textile material which is folded up 
and stowed in the non-activated state. 
A safety device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the restraining means (3, 34) is 

a woven fabric, knitted fabric, plaited fabric or net. 
A safety device according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the traction mechanism (6, 7, 38) 

is guided and can be fixed once the activated state of 
the restraining means (3, 34) has been achieved. 
A safety device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the drive means (17, 37) consists 

of a biassed spring element.  
 
A safety device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the drive means (17, 37) consists 

of a piston-cylinder unit (15, 16) which can be 
supplied with a fluid. 
A safety device according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the piston-cylinder unit (15, 16) 

is connected to a gas generator (20). 
A safety device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the gas generator (20) is filled 

with compressed air. 
A safety device according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the gas generator (20) is filled 

with a solid explosive charge (19) which can be ignited 
by priming. 
A safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the drive means (17, 37), the 

traction mechanism (6, 7, 38) and the restraining means 

<
(3, 34) are housed in the door frame (2, 33). 
A safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the drive means (17, 37), the 

traction mechanism (6, 7, 38) and/or the restraining 
means (3, 34) are housed in the regions of the car body 

structure of the vehicle adjacent to the door frame (2, 
33). 
A safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 
11, characterised in that the airbag (26) of the airbag 

impact protection unit (25, 42) and the restraining 
means (3, 34) or traction mechanism (6, 7, 38) are 

securely fastened together.  
 
A safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 
12, characterised in that the airbag impact protection 

unit (25, 42) is housed in the door. 
A safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 
13, characterised in that the airbag impact protection 

unit (25, 42) is housed in the regions of the floor 
spar, the roof spar, the door spars, in particular the
