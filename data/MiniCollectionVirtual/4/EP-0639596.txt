<ABSTRACT>
A flexible or semi-hard polyurethane foam 
is prepared from a blend containing a polyhydroxyl 

compound, an isocyanate, a blowing 
agent, a catalyst, and a foam stabilizer. A 

polyolefin polyol is used as the polyhydroxyl 
compound. A carboxy, epoxy or methacryl-modified 

organosilicone is used as the foam 
stabilizer. The resulting polyurethane foam is 

impermeable to water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
preparing a water-impermeable, flexible or 
semi-hard, open cell polyurethane foam. Several methods are known in the art for 
the preparation of low air-permeable, water-impermeable, 
flexible or semi-hard, open cell 
polyurethane foams. For example, (1) a flexible 
or semi-hard, open cell polyurethane foam is 
impregnated with a volatile solution of asphalt 
followed by drying. (2) A sealing material in 
the form of a flexible or semi-hard, open cell 
polyurethane foam is prepared by combining at 
least one of a polydienic polyol, a dimer acid 
polyol, and a polyol having more than 90 mol% of 
an alkylene oxide addition polymerized thereto 
with a hydroxyl-containing organosilicone as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B)  
 
No. 55470/1990. (3) Japanese Patent 
Application Kokai (JP-A) No. 27583/1988 
discloses a method for preparing a sealing 
material in the form of a polyurethane foam 
having a polyolefin skeleton as a polyol. (4) 
JP-A 298574/1990 discloses a method for 
preparing sealing material in the form of a 
saturated hydrocarbon resin skeleton 
polyurethane foam using a hydroxyl-containing 
reactive silicone. These methods have the following 
drawbacks. Method (1) suffers from the problems 
of environmental pollution by the solvent given 
off during the drying step, foam productivity, 
and collapse of once expanded cells. Method (2) 
has no outer appearance problem if the foam 
density is as high as 40 kg/m³, but in a low 
density region, suffers from the occurrence of 
void-like pinholes or cracks within the foam. 
Methods (3) and (4) are not economical. Often, conventional flexible or semi-hard, 
open cell polyurethane foams are generally 
prepared by using a polyether or polymeric 
polyol mainly containing a propylene oxide with 
a molecular weight of 450 to 8,000, tolylene  
 
diisocyanate, a blowing agent, and a foam 
stabilizer. Depending on particular types of 
polyol and amine catalyst as well as their 
amounts, low air-permeable foams can be 
prepared in a relatively simple manner. 
However, it is not expectable that the resulting 
foams are also impermeable to water. JP-A 245623/1985 discloses a flexible 
polyurethane foam having low air permeability 
which is prepared from a blend containing a 
polyether polyol and a carboxyl-modified 
organosilicone. This foam is less impermeable 
to water. Furthermore, JP-A 38152/1989 
discloses to use as the foam stabilizer an 
organosilicone compound which is based on a 
polydialkylsiloxane

<CLAIMS>
A method for preparing a flexible or 
semi-hard polyurethane foam from a blend 

containing a polyhydroxyl compound, an isocyanate, 
a blowing agent, a catalyst, and a foam 

stabilizer, characterized in that 
   a polyolefin polyol is used as the 

polyhydroxyl compound, and 
   at least one member selected from the 

group consisting of a carboxy-modified 
organosilicone, an epoxy-modified organo-silicone, 

and a methacryl-modified organo-silicone 
is used as the foam stabilizer, 

   whereby a water-impermeable polyurethane 
foam is obtained. 
The method of claim 1 wherein about 
0.3 to 5 parts by weight of the foam stabilizer 

is used per 100 parts by weight of the polyhydroxyl 
compound.
