<ABSTRACT>
In a windscreen wiper system with a wiper arm (20) pivotally mounted and a drive causing the wiper arm (20) to pivot the drive has a reversible electrical motor (11) and a control unit which switches the electrical motor (11). The latter has a housing in two sections. The first section (1) can be mounted immoveably in relation to the vehicle and includes the stator portion. The second section (22) of the housing can turn in relation to the first (1), includes the rotor portion (13), and is connected to the wiper arm (29). The rotating second section (22) of the housing is preferably provided with a bearing sleeve (21) which is mounted on an axial supporting lug (3) of the first section (1) of the housing.

A windshield wiper system with a pivotably supported wiper arm (20) and a drive that 
swivels the wiper arm (20), the drive having a reversible electric motor (11) mounted solidly 

to the vehicle and a control unit that switches the electric motor (11), characterized in that a 
two-part housing (1, 22) is provided, that the first housing 

part (1) carries the stator portion (12) of the electric 
motor (11) and is mountable solidly to the vehicle, and that 

the second housing part (22) is provided with the rotor 
portion (13), is rotatable relative to the first housing part 

(1), and is connected to the wiper arm (20) in a manner fixed 
against relative rotation. 
A windshield wiper system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that connected to the second housing part (22) is a bearing 

sleeve (21), which is supported on a supporting lug (3) that 
is disposed on the housing part (1) that is solidly mounted 

to the vehicle. 
A windshield wiper system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the housing part (1) mountable solidly 

to the vehicle is embodied as cup-shaped, and the second 
housing part (22) that is provided with the rotor portion 

(13) is embodied as lidlike.  
 
A windshield wiper system according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the stator portion (12) is provided on the cup wall (4) 

of the housing part (1) mountable solidly to the vehicle. 
A windshield wiper system according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the stator portion (12) is provided on the supporting 

lug (3), and the second housing part (22) is embodied as 
cup-shaped and forms an outer rotor portion (13). 
A windshield wiper system according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the bearing sleeve (21) forms the motor power take-off 

shaft (14). 
A windshield wiper system according to claim 2, characterized in 
that an intermediate gear (23) is embodied between the motor 

power take-off shaft (14) and the bearing sleeve (21). 
A windshield wiper system according to claim 4 or 5 and 7, 
characterized in that the cup wall (4) of the housing part 

(1) that is mountable solidly to the vehicle, or the outer 
rotor portion (13), is provided with the ring gear (26) of a 

planetary gear (23), and the second housing part (22) has a 
supporting flange for the planet wheels (24).  

 
A windshield wiper system according to one of claims 2-8, 
characterized in that the supporting lug (3) is disposed 

axially adjustably on the housing part (1) that is mountable 
solidly to the vehicle. 
A windshield wiper system according to one of claims 2-9, 
characterized in that an axially adjustable pawl (33) is 

provided on the supporting lug (3), which pawl in a first 
position connects in a manner fixed against relative rotation 

the supporting lug (3) to the housing part (1) that is mountable solidly 
to the vehicle, and in a second position the supporting lug (3) 

to the bearing sleeve (21). 
A windshield wiper system according to one of claims 1-10, 
characterized in that the control circuit of the electric 

motor (11) includes fuzzy logic. 
A windshield wiper system according to one of claims 1-11, 
characterized in that the control circuit of the electric 

motor (11) includes a neural network.
