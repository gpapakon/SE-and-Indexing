<ABSTRACT>
A liquid spray pump comprising: [a] a jacket (1), defining a

longitudinal axis (7), [b] a piston (3), for being inserted, at least partially, in

the jacket (1), and adapted for being moved in the direction of the
longitudinal axis (7) along the jacket (1), [c]
 at least one annular lip (15),
surrounding a section of the piston (3) perpendicular to the longitudinal axis

(7), [d] a hollow internal space (17) defined between the jacket (1) and the

piston (3), and [e] at least one shoulder (19) on the piston (3) occupying at

least in part the hollow internal space (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid spray pump of the type according to preamble of claim 1.Spray pumps of the type indicated hereinabove are known for instance from US-A-5 738 250. They
are used in a multiplicity of applications for manual pumping of more or less
viscous liquid products, the pump being actuated by a push button, an
operating lever, etc. They are generally used for cleaning products, do-it-yourself
products, cosmetics, gardening products, etc. These pumps are
usually made of plastics materials, such as, for example, polythene and
polypropylene, whereby they may be more or less sensitive to the products
being pumped, particularly if such products contain aggressive elements,
organic solvents, gels, lacquers or other compounds which may alter the
properties of the plastics forming the pump. Particularly, these spray pumps
are usually provided with annular lips which form a tight seal between the
piston and the wall of the jacket surrounding the piston. Simultaneously,
these annular lips serve as a guide for the piston in its longitudinal
movement along the surrounding jacket. These lips are particularly
sensitive to aggression and, if degraded as a result of such aggression,
they may cease to operate correctly in their guide function for the piston.It is an object of the invention to overcome this drawback. This
object is achieved with a liquid spray pump of the type first mentioned 
above in which the piston is provided with the characterizing features of claim 1.In fact, in a pump of this type, the piston is guided by the shoulders.
These shoulders do not provide for the liquid tightness, but only for the
guiding, whereby they may be designed more strongly so that the
aggressivity of the liquid does not have any appreciable influence on the
guiding capacity of the shoulders.Between the piston and the jacket there is usually a hollow internal
space serving for various functions: liquid passage, removal of air during
the priming of the pump, etc. According to the invention this is
achieved by inserting slots between the shoulders allowing the
establishment of a communication through which a fluid may flow.Further advantages and characteristics of the invention will be
appreciated from the following description in which one preferred
embodiment of the invention is disclosed without any limiting nature, with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a cross section view of a conventional spray pump.Figure 2 is a cross section view of another conventional spray
pump.Figure

<CLAIMS>
A liquid spray pump of the type comprising: [a] a jacket (1),

said jacket (1) defining a longitudinal axis (7), [b] a piston (3), for being

inserted, at least partially, in said jacket (1), said piston (3) being adapted
for being moved in the direction of said longitudinal axis (7) along said

jacket (1), changing thereby the volume of a pumping chamber (11) and
causing thereby the compression and depression required for pumping a

liquid contained in a container, [c] at least one annular lip (15), surrounding

a section of said piston (3) perpendicular to said longitudinal axis (7), and
[d]
 a hollow internal space (17) defined between said jacket (1) and said
piston (3), wherein said piston (3) is provided with at least one shoulder

(19) occupying at least in part said hollow internal space (17), 
characterized
in that
 slots (21) allowing the passage of a fluid are arranged between said
shoulders (19).
