<ABSTRACT>
A refuse collection compaction vehicle (20) houses in a constant 
section container (22) a moveable partition wall (73) capable of 

compressing materials lengthwise in either direction. A hydraulic 
cylinder (84) is attached to the floor and covered by a protective 

sheath (130) attached to the partition wall and moveable with the wall. 
The wall comprises a frame installed on sliding skates (80). The frame 

houses a door (70) which is hinged on top and may be tipped to let 
pass the compacted products of the fore compartment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a refuse collection container vehicle
having two reception chambers and a mobile over the top feed
mechanism for the collection of waste materials.A need has been developed for a waste collection vehicle which
readily differentiates fibrous combustible materials from non fibrous
materials. Many such vehicles have been developed and one of them,
according to the preamble of claim 1,
is described in US patent 5,122,025 June 1992 by Glomski, a patent
which describes a mobile interior wall which opens and closes
storage space in a truck. Glomski utilizes small buckets and repeated
compaction in the loading zone, which is not practical for loading.The art also discloses a German patent DE 3,231,002 10 March
1983 by Fahrzengbau, which discloses a compressible volume defined
by the location of a deflector of a hopper; the location of the hopper
cannot be modified by the operator nor can be modified the area of
loading. This method although effective in use is very complicated in
its mechanical structure.The object of the present invention is to provide a
refuse collection and compaction vehicle as defined in claim 1.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is
provided a side charging and over the top loading vehicle which
comprises a moveable wall which compresses fibrous materials on the
forward stroke and compresses the non fibrous materials on the back
stroke. The loading follows the moveable wall on either side by
manual displacement of a limit marker. Another object of this
invention is to utilize the near totality of the volume of the container 
to store fibrous and non fibrous materials and a further object is to
allow the loading of two different materials and to allow the relative
compaction of both.Another objective is to optimize the spreading of the charge in
the bin because side loading implies a large proportion of the charge
falling always at the same spot near the loading side.A further objective is to allow a variable volume in each of the
compartments, resulting from compaction on each side of the
partition and up to the top and to provide ease of unloading.A general objective is to provide a dual compartment
compaction vehicle comprising a housing such as a container of
generally cubical shape with a fore end, an aft end, a roof, a floor,
two sides, a length and a generally rectangular, constant dimension
cross section extending from the fore end to the aft end, and defining
an interior storage area. An interior wall extending within the
interi
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dual compartment compaction vehicle comprising a container
(22) having a fore end (46), an aft end (44), a roof, a floor (43), two

lateral walls, a length and a generally rectangular, constant
dimension, cross section extending from said fore end (46) to said aft

end (44) and defining an interior storage area, an interior wall
extending within said interior storage area for defining two

compartments within said interior storage area, said interior wall
being attached for movement to selectively alter the respective sizes

of said compartments, said interior wall comprising a moveable
partition frame (74) being supported by a pair of tubes (80) disposed lengthwise with respect

to the container and adapted to fit within two channels (82) extending longitudinally
along the container for sliding in cooperation with said channels, 

a partition door (70) fixed within the limits
thereof and hydraulic means comprising cylinder means (84) oriented lengthwise within said

container, said hydraulic means also comprising piston means
(85) attached to said moveable partition frame (74) for

displacing said moveable partition frame (74) towards said aft
end (44) and from said aft end (44) towards said fore end (46), 

said compaction vehicle characterized by:

said moveable partition frame (74) being installed
perpendicularly with respect to said length and having two upper (74') and lower

(72) beams and two lateral beams (74'' and 74''') fixed together by
their respective ends and of same dimension as the dimensions of said

cross section, said partition door being a compaction door (70) of
generally same dimensions as of said moveable partition frame (74), and

comprising a door top being hinged (140) to said upper beam and a
door bottom being releasably locked to said lower beam (72), said

two compartments receiving different waste materials to be
compacted between said compaction door and said fore and aft ends,
means attached to said upper beam for pivotally retaining said
door top when said door bottom is released.
A dual compartment compaction vehicle as defined in claim 1
wherein said compaction door (70) comprises an access door (75)

within the limits of said compaction door (70) and comprises means
for locking said access door (75) against said compaction door (70).
A dual compartment compaction vehicle as defined in claim 2
wherein said means for locking said compaction door (70) onto said

moveable partition frame (74) comprise locking bars (112 and 114)
adapted to be inserted into anchor points (110 and 111) of

said moveable partition frame (74), said locking bars being mounted
on opposite arms of a pivoted bar lever (116) with a pivot point (117)

installed on said compaction door (70), said pivoted bar lever (116)
having an arm having a spring (119) biased towards normally

maintaining said locking bars (112 and 114) in said anchor points
(110 and 111), the action of pushing against one arm counter to said

spring (119) causing the retrieval of said locking bars (112 and 114)
and the unlocking of said compaction door (70) from said moveable

partition frame (74).
A dual compartment compaction vehicle as defined in claim 1
wherein said channels (82) are C-shaped channels installed on said floor (43).
