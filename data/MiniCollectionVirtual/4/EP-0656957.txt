<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for phosphatizing the zinc-coated surface of a steel strip electrolytically zinc-coated on one side only by a short spraying or immersion treatment with acid phosphatizing solutions which contain 1.0 to 6.0 g/l Zn2+ cations, 0.5 to 5.0 g/l Ni2+ cations and 14 to 25 g/l PO43 anions. The "free acid" content amounts to 3.5 to 8.0 points; the total acid content amounts to 22 to 40 points.

<CLAIMS>
A process for phosphating the galvanized surface of 
steel strip electrolytically galvanized on one side to 

form nickel-containing zinc phosphate coatings with a 
weight per unit area of 0.5 to 3.0 gm
2-
 by brief spraying 
with or immersion in acidic phosphating solutions, 

characterized in that the treatment time is 2 to 20 s,

content of Ni
2+
 cations:
0.5 to 5.0 g/l, 
content of PO

3-
 anions:
14 to 25 g/l, 
"free acid" content:
3.5 to 8.0 points, 
"total acid" content:
22 to 40 points. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the treatment time is 5 to 10 s. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the content of Zn
2+
 cations is 3.0 to 5.0 g/l. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the content of Ni
2+
 cations is 
1.0 to 3.0 g/l. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the phosphating solution contains 

19 to 23 g/l of phosphate anions. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the phosphating solutions 

additionally contain at least one other divalent cation 
selected from manganese, cobalt, iron, calcium and magnesium 

in concentrations of the respective cations of 0.2 
to 3.0 g/l manganese, 0.5 to 4.0 g/l cobalt, 0.05 to 1.0 

g/l iron and 0.5 to 5.0 g/l calcium or magnesium. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to  
 

6, characterized in that the phosphating solutions have 
a content of fluoride anions of 0.1 to 0.5 g/l. 
A process as claimed on one or more of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that phosphating is carried out at a 

temperature of 55 to 65°C. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that the zinc phosphate coatings have 

a weight per unit area of 1.0 to 2.0 gm
-2
. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that the steel strip electrolytically 

galvanized on one side has been subjected to an activating 
pretreatment known per se.
