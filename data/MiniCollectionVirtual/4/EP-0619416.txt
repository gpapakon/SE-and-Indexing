<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for extracting blocks of 
stone material by means of tubular expansion devices 

operated at high fluid pressures. The devices are 
introduced at ambient pressure into cylindrical bores 

formed in the material to be excavated, in the region of 
the desired parting planes of the block from the rock. 

The pressure is then increased up to 100-500 bar so as to 
obtain parting of the block. 
Each expansion device consists of a tube of 
plastic material with a high modulus of elasticity 

provided at its opposite ends with metal sealing members 
which are axially bored and connected to one another by 

a metal rod housed inside the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device used in an apparatus for
excavating stone blocks during the mining of marble or
granite or during excavation or surface-stripping works.The methods for excavating stone blocks, in
particular in marble and granite mining, have over the
years evolved constantly as regards the type of equipment
used and hence the final excavation speed, but have
nevertheless, during the course of this evolution, always
been closely associated with two highly traditional
excavation techniques involving the use of a wire and
explosive.According to the first technique, the block is
cut from the bed with the aid of a wire or rather an
annularly arranged steel cable which conveys the abrasive
material (in the case of the most traditional cutting
method involving water and sand) or to which the abrasive
material is permanently fixed (in the case of the most
recent method involving diamond-based abrasive materials
in the form of small grains or beads threaded onto the
wire and fixed to the latter). Nowadays the wire and
sand cutting method has been more or less abandoned on
account of the slowness of the cutting operation and the
need to provide a fairly long section of wire which
allows the latter to cool properly and have a longer
service life. The cutting method which uses a diamond-coated
wire, on the other hand, has spread rapidly, owing
to both the higher cutting speed which is possible and
the greater compactness and simplicity of the machinery
compared to that traditionally used.The cutting method which uses a diamond-coated
wire, however, has several drawbacks. Firstly, from a
technical point of view, it requires the availability of
a certain amount of free space in front of and on the
sides of the vein to be cut so as to allow displacement 
of the wire operating machine which must move backwards
as the cutting operation proceeds; it is therefore not
possible to use this method in all those excavation
situations where this space cannot be easily provided.
Furthermore, from a safety point of view, said method is
particularly dangerous should the wire break, not so much
because of the "whiplash" effect of the broken ends of
the wire, whose radius of action can be predicted and
limited, but more on account of the beads which come free
in the breakage zone and are flung out at high speed, in
some cases over a considerable distance, with the risk of
causing injury and even death. Finally, from an economic
point of view, said method requires a considerable outlay
and repeated

Fluid pressure expansion device (E) used in an apparatus
for excavating a block (M) from a vein of stone material,

adapted to be introduced into bores made along
the desired parting planes of said block, said device

consisting of a tube (1) made of a plastic material with
a high modulus of elasticity, which is provided at its

opposite ends with metal sealing members, which are
axially bored and connected to one another by a metal

rod (2) housed inside said tube (1), so as to form
therebetween an internal chamber for housing a working

fluid,
characterised in that,

each sleeve (3) is screwed onto one end of said tube (1)
and each sleeve (3) further comprises a union screwed in

turn to said sleeve (3b,4b) and said rod (2), with said
union respectively comprising a male-type union (4M) at

one tube end and a female-type union (4F) at the other
tube end, and each union having an elongated conical end

(5) which is adapted to penetrate inside the tube (1)
end so as to force the tube (1) against the inner wall

of the corresponding sleeve (3). 
Fluid pressure expansion device as in 1), in which said sleeve (3) has a first
threaded internal surface (3a) with a wide pitch and large thread, which is designated to

engage with and fit tightly onto the external surface of said tube (1).
Fluid pressure expansion device as in 1) and 2), in which said sleeve (3) has a
second threaded internal surface (3b), apt to be engaged with a corresponding external

threaded surface (4b) of one of said unions (4M, 4F).
Fluid pressure expansion device as in 3), in which said second threaded internal
surface (3b) has a diameter smaller than said first threaded internal surface (3a) and greater

than the external diameter of said rod (2).
Fluid pressure expansion device as in 1) and 3), in which said male (4M) and
female (4F) unions have an elongated end (5) directed towards said tube (1), said end (5)

comprising a cylindrical section, bearing said external threaded surface (4b), and a conical
section, bearing a cylindrical internal threaded surface (5a), apt to be engaged with a

corresponding threaded end of said rod (2).
Fluid pressure expansion device as in 5), in which said external threaded surface
(4b) of said unions (4M, 4F) has a pitch identical to that of said cylindrical internal threaded

surface (5a) of the elongate end (5) of the same unions (4M, 4F). 
Fluid pressure expansion device as in 1) to 6), in which each of said unions (4M,
4F) have a shoulder (6) apt to make a seal against its corresponding sleeve (3), thank to a

interposed sealing gasket (7).
Fluid pressure expansion device according to claims 1) to 7), in which said plastic
material is a polyurethane resin based material.
Fluid pressure expansion device according to claims 1) to 8), apt to be joined to
one or two similar devices by means of screwing of the male/female union of adjacent

devices, with the arrangement in between of a sealing gasket, to form an expansion device
of greater length.
