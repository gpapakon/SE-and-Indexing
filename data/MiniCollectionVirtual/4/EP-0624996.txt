<ABSTRACT>
A profile is created from information recorded in the recording means (MRNR) in the form of a first work file, and obtained in the course of the movements of a particular mobile subscriber over a first predetermined duration of observation, the said information relating to a plurality of daily chronological periods spread over the first duration of observation and each having a start defined by the time at which the mobile subscriber entered a localisation zone with particular daily identity (Z k-1j), and an end determined by the time at which the said mobile subscriber came out of the said localisation zone with identity (Z k-1j) and entered another localisation zone with identity (Zkj).

Radiotelephony process comprising the following stages:

a) providing at least one mobile telephone (MS) for a predetermined mobile
subscriber having a predetermined mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), said

mobile telephone being intended for intercommunication with fixed telephones
(PF) connected to a fixed telephone communication network (RTC),
b) providing a plurality of geographical location zones, each radio-covered
by at least one base station (BS1, BS2), each location zone having

a predetermined identity (Zi),
c) providing recording means (MENR) connected to the base stations and
containing information relative to the identity of the subscriber (IMSI)

and the identity of the current location zone of the mobile telephone,
d) at the recording means (MENR), creating a profile (L3) for the mobile
subscriber constituted by a list of couplets (Zi, fi), in which (Zi) is a

location zone identity and (fi) represents a function with at least one
operand giving the probability of locating the subscriber in the location

zone (Zi) at a given time and storing said profile created in this way in
the recording means (MENR),
e) after storage of the profile (L3), in response to a telephone call
request intended for the mobile subscriber (IAM), interrogating the recording

means for selecting in the profile (L3) at least the highest probability
location zone identity according to the operand and broadcasting a

search message (PAGE MS) in the location zone, whose identity is selected
in this way,
f) in the case of a positive location, the mobile telephone receives the
search message and in response establishes the radiotelephone intercommunication

with the caller, whereas in the case of a negative location (PAGE
FAILURE), the routing means (MACH) broadcast the search message (PAGE MS)

in another location zone, if appropriate,

characterized in that the profile (L3) is created on the basis of information 
recorded in the recording means (MENR) in the form of a first work

file (STAT) and obtained during movements of a particular mobile subscriber

during a first, predetermined observation period, said information relating
to a plurality of daily chronological periods spread over the first observation

period and each having a start (DEkj) determined by the time at
which the mobile subscriber has entered a particular, daily identity

location zone (Z k-1j) and a finish (DSkj) determined by the time at which
said mobile subscriber has left said identity location zone (Z k-1j) and

has entered another identity location zone (Zkj).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that on the basis of the
first work file (STAT), at the recording means there is a processing algorithm

comprising the following stages:

i) constructing, on the basis of the start and finish times of the
different daily chronological periods of the first work file (STAT), a list

(L1) of successive, weekly chronological periods (PCo): the first weekly
chronological period (PCo) having a start (DEo) with a value equal to or

higher than 0000 hours and a finish corresponding to the finish time of the
weekly chronological period (PCkj) of the first work file (STAT) having the

smallest value among those of the finish times of the daily chronological
periods of said work file and the final weekly chronological period having

a finish (DSo) of a value equal to or lower than 2359 hours and a start
(DEo) corresponding to the starting time of the daily chronological period

(PCkj) having the highest value among the starting times of the daily
chronological periods of the first work file (STAT), whereby to each weekly

chronological period is allocated the daily identity of the location zone
of the corresponding, daily chronological period,
ii) on examining the information of the first work file (STAT), collecting
the different daily identities of the location zone allocated for each

thus constructed, weekly chronological period,
iii) counting the recurrence of each daily identity of the location zone
for each weekly chronological period and 
iv) sequencing the different daily identities of the location zones as a
function of their recurrence for each weekly chronological period.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that it also comprises
the following stages:


constructing, in the operating mode of the mobile telephone, a second
work file (MAJ), substantially similar to the first work file (STAT) and

containing information relative to the daily chronological periods and to
the location zone identities recorded during a second predetermined period

following the first observation period of the first work file and not
recorded in said first work file (STAT) during said first observation

period and
processing said new information in accordance with stages i to iv in
order to update the profile (L3).
Radiotelephony installation for performing the process according to
one of the preceding claims, comprising:


at least one mobile telephone (MS) for a predetermined mobile subscriber
having a predetermined, mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), said mobile telephone

being intended to intercommunicate with fixed telephones (PF) connected
to a fixed telephone communication network (RTC),
a plurality of geographic location zones, each radio-covered by at least
one base station (BS1, BS2), each location zone having a predetermined

identity,
recording means (MENR) linked with the base stations and containing
information relative to the subscriber identity (IMSI) and the identity of

the current location zone of the mobile telephone,
with respect to the recording means (MENR), processing means able to
create a profile (L3) for the mobile subscriber constituted by a list of

couplets (Zi, fi) in which (Zi) is a location zone identity and (fi) 
represents a function with at least one operand giving the probability of

locating the subscriber in the location zone (Zi) at a given time and
storage means able to store the thus created profile (L3),

characterized in that said processing means are able to create the profile
(L3) from information recorded in the recording means (MRNR) in the form of

a first work file (STAT) and obtained during movements of a particular mobile
subscriber during a first, predetermined observation period, said

information relating to a plurality of daily chronological periods spreading
over the first observation period and each having a start (DEkj) determined

by the time at which the mobile subscriber has entered a particular,
daily identity location zone (Z k-1j) and a finish (DSkj) determined by the

time at which said mobile subscriber has left said identity location zone
(Zkj) and has entered another identity location zone (Zkj).
