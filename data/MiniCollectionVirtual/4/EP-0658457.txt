<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of this invention to make compact a system for 
controlling the distribution of a driving force and also to 

simplify its controlling procedure. To achieve this object, a 
motor 200, 2200 is desiged to be electrically controlled, and the 

rotation of the motor is transformed to the stroke of a plunger 
370, 2370 by a hydraulic pressure producing cylinder device 300. 

By doing this, a hydraulic pressure is produced within a 
hydraulic pressure chamber 376, 2376 and the hydraulic pressure 

thus produced is supplied to an operating cylinder 40. The 
operating cylinder 40 controls a gain of an engagement force of 

a variable torque clutch device 30. Also, it is another object 
of the present invention to provide a fail-safe technique for a 

hydraulic pressure supply device of the motor drive type. In 
order to achieve this second object, there is further employed 

a hydraulic pressure compensating device 500, 2500 for supplying, 
when a failure has occurred disenabling rotation of the motor 

200, 2200, a predetermined hydraulic pressure to the operating 
cylinder 40 in response to the occurrence of the failure and 

maintain the hydraulic pressure to that level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a driving force distribution control
technique intended to vary the distribution of driving force to be
transmitted from an engine to front and rear wheels in a four
wheel drive vehicle as specified in the preamble of claim 1, for
example as disclosed in US-A-4773500. Particularly, it relates to
a hydraulic pressure supply device of the motor drive type which
is suited to be made compact, and to a fail-safe technique for
coping with a failure of the device.A driving force distribution control technique of this type is
intended for improving the safety of driving a vehicle. For
example, it is a technique for varying the distribution ratio of
a driving force transmitted from the engine such that the driving
mode of the vehicle is changed from a completely rear-wheel drive
mode to a front-wheel and rear-wheel drive mode at the ratio of
50:50.In such driving force distribution control technique, there is a
provision of a variable torque clutch device, such as a multiple
disc clutch, located on that portion of a driving force
transmission path leading from the engine to front or rear wheels,
so that a magnitude of the driving force to be transmitted
(namely, driving force distribution) is varied by controlling a
gain of the engagement force of the variable torque clutch device.
The means for controlling a gain of a clutch engagement force
includes an operating cylinder serving as an actuator, and a
hydraulic pressure supply device (or unit) for supplying a
hydraulic pressure to the operating cylinder in accordance with a
command from outside. Conventionally, a hydraulic pressure supply
device generally comprises a pump serving as a hydraulic pressure
source, an accumulator which stores, at a predetermined pressure,
a fluid which has been discharged from the pump, and a
proportional solenoid valve for regulating the hydraulic pressure
in the accumulator in accordance with a command from a controller
and outputs it to an operating cylinder side. The conventional
techniques so far discussed are disclosed, for example, in 
US-A-4773500 or US-A-4986388.However, those conventional hydraulic pressure control devices
have several difficulties in making the control device compact and
simplifying the controlling procedure using the device. The most
serious difficulty among them is as follows. Since both a pump
and an accumulator are essential, the hydraulic control unit
itself becomes large in size and this makes it difficult to
fulfill the requirement to make the overall system
