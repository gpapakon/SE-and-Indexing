<DESCRIPTION>
In 1989 approximately 700 million pounds of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were consumed to
produce soft drink bottles. Presently about 28% of
this material is recycled with the remainder being
placed in landfills or incinerated. Due to problems
with overloaded landfills and the negative
environmental image plastics has received recently,
bills have been introduced aimed at establishing
bottle deposits and the number of curbside recycling
programs has increased tremendously. The collection
of PET bottles and food trays through these programs
has resulted in a source of post-consumer PET which
has been used for a number of applications. Generally
these applications involve the conversion and
fabrication of the post-consumer PET into materials of
lower value. Examples of such applications are
polyols for unsaturated polyesters or polyurethanes,
fiberfill, carpet fibers, and strapping. Recycled PET
is also blended with other materials such as
polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, or glass
fibers, etc., for automotive as well as other
engineering applications.Post-consumer PET can also be recycled into resin
which can be used in manufacturing containers for
foods and beverages, such as carbonated beverage
bottles. In such procedures, the post-consumer PET is
generally depolymerized to oligomers or its monomers
which are subsequently utilized as a raw material in
the preparation of the recycled PET resin. Such a
procedure for depolymerizing PET is described in
United States Patent 3,703,488 and United States
Patent 3,884,850. In such recycling programs, it is important to
separate the post-consumer PET from other plastics in
the recycle stream. Foreign materials can be removed
from such post-consumer PET feed stream by hand
separation. Foreign materials, such as other
plastics, can also be removed from the post-consumer
PET feed stream by flotation procedures which are
based upon density and/or wettability differences
between the plastics. Nevertheless, such procedures
generally do not result in the total removal of
foreign materials from the post-consumer PET feed
stream. This is particularly true of glues, small
particle size foreign materials, and polymeric melt
blends. For instance, some post-consumer PET sources
are melt blends of the PET with one or more other
plastics. In the case of such melt blends, the other
plastics cannot be removed from the PET by physical
separation procedures. For instance, dual ovenable
trays which are used extensively by the frozen
prepared food industry typically

<CLAIMS>
A process for removing foreign materials from a post-consumer
polyethylene terephthalate feed stream which comprises:

(1) depolymerizing the polyethylene terephthalate in the post-consumer
polyethylene terephthalate feed

stream into a liquid having a viscosity between 0.001
and 1000 poise, (2) feeding the liquid into a density based

separation device, (3) allowing low density foreign
materials to migrate to and float upon the surface of

the liquid, and (4) removing depolymerized polyethylene
terephthalate from below the surface of the liquid.
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
depolymerized polyethylene terephthalate is

polyethylene terephthalate oligomer.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the
melt is at a temperature between 180째C and 310째C,

preferably 220째C to 270째C.
A process for removing foreign materials from a post-consumer
polyethylene terephthalate feed stream which comprises:

(1) dissolving the polyethylene terephthalate in the post-consumer
polyethylene terephthalate feed

stream in a sufficient amount of a solvent to produce a
liquid system having a viscosity between 0.001 and

1,000 poise, (2) feeding the liquid stream into a density based
separation device, (3) allowing low density foreign

materials to migrate to and float upon the surface of
the liquid system, and (4) removing dissolved purified

polyethylene terephthalate from below the surface of
the liquid system.
A process as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein
high density foreign materials are allowed to sink to

the bottom of the liquid system, and depolymerised
polyethylene terephthalate or dissolved purified

polyethylene terephthalate is removed from an area
located intermediately between the surface of the

liquid and the bottom of the liquid. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1-4
wherein the liquid has a viscosity between 0.01 and 100

poise, preferably 0.1 to 10 poise.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1-6
wherein the separation device is enhanced by

centrifugal action.
