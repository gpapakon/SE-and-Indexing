<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vibration test rig (bench) for a cable, making it possible to subject a cable to vibrational tests at a predetermined frequency and in one or more chosen vibrational modes; characterised in that the test rig comprises means (2,70,20) for keeping the tensile force on the cable constant throughout the vibrational test in order to sustain the chosen vibrational mode. Application to vibrational tests of transmission cables.

<CLAIMS>
Vibration test bed for a cable enabling a cable to be 
subjected to vibration tests at a given frequency and in one 

or more chosen vibration modes; characterised in that the test 
bench includes means (2, 70, 20) for maintaining the tensile 

force on the cable constant throughout the vibration test in 
order to sustain the chosen vibration mode. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the maintaining means include means (7, 1, 3, 4) for 

measuring and regulating the tensile force imposed on the 
cable in order to correct any differences between this tensile 

force and a given tension value to be maintained. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 2, comprising a 
device for drawing the cable (37), the cable being tensioned 

between this device and a fixed clamp (81), characterised in 
that the measuring and regulating means include a force sensor 

(7) measuring the traction exerted on the cable by means of a 
rope (6) attached to the cable, means for controlling (90, 70) 

and means for moving (40, 1, 3, 4) the drawing device, the 
control means being suitable for bringing about movements of 

the drawing devices in order to obtain an adjustment of the 
tension exerted to the given value. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the movement means include runners (4) on which the 

drawing device is placed, a geared motor (1) coupled to a 
screw (3) bringing about the movement of the drawing device on 

these runners in accordance with an instruction received from 
the control means. 
Vibration test bed according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cable is connected to the 

drawing device by means of an oscillating arm (8) moved by the  
 

device. 
Test bed according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
connection between the cable and the arm is effected by a 

tapered gripper (32) located at a vibration node of the cable. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the drawing device includes an electropneumatic system 

comprising an articulated head (31) able to move the arm in 
any required oscillation plane. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the electropneumatic system includes a shaft (42) 

supporting the articulated head (31) coupled to means (19) for 
driving this shaft in rotation. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the articulated head (31) has two jacks 

(10) and a proportional control valve (11) enabling the two 
jacks to be moved in alternation, these jacks being fixed to a 

first plate supporting the oscillating arm, which is itself 
mounted on the articulated head. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the means for driving in rotation (19) include a geared 

motor (19) driving the support arm by means of a pulley (18) 
and a transmission belt (41). 
Vibration test bed according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the control means include an 

electropneumatic control (70) controlling the device driving 
the oscillating arm, an automatic control device (90) for this 

electropneumatic control including a processing unit loaded 
with a test program, the unit being provided with an 

input/output peripheral (21) for receiving the intrinsic 
characteristics of the cable and the characteristics relating 

to the test.  
 
Test bed according to Claim 11, characterised in that the 
processing means loaded with the test program make it 

possible, when the intrinsic characteristics of the cable and 
characteristics relating to the test are received, to carry 

out a preliminary step consisting of: 

calculating the natural frequency of the cable for the 
vibration mode chosen as a function of a specified tension 

value Tps, 
positioning the drawing device at a predetermined location 
on the runners in order to subject the cable to the specified 

tension, 
sending a control signal to the electropneumatic control in 
order to act on the cable at the calculated natural vibration 

frequency and to cause the control signal to change so that 
the vibration frequency changes in progressive steps around 

the calculated natural frequency until the true natural 
frequency fk of the cable is obtained, this frequency being 

obtained for a dynamic tension Tmax. 
Vibration test bed according to Claim 12, characterised 
in that the processing means loaded with the test program are 

suitable for determining the true natural frequency by 
measuring, during the preliminary step, the dynamic tension of 

the cable and seeking, amongst the measured values, the

obtained when there is equality between these two tension 
values.

initiating the vibration of the cable at the corrected 
vibration frequency fr such that: 


correcting the position of the drawing device so as to
