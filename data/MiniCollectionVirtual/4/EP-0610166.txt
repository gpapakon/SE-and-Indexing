<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing 
a compact fluorescent lamp of the kind which 
includes a gas discharge tube which is provided with 
an inner fluorescent coating and electrodes, and a 
base which houses an ignition device or starter, a 
capacitor and connector pins for powering and operating 
the fluorescent lamp, wherein the ignition device 
and the capacitor are housed in an elongated central 
chamber in the base, wherein a tube part which includes 
the gas discharge tube and a base part are 
produced separately, wherein the ignition device, 
capacitor and electrodes are mutually connected and 
accommodated in an elongated central chamber in the 
base part, and the tube part and the base part are 
joined together. The invention also relates to a 
compact fluorescent lamp produced in accordance with 
the inventive method. One problem encountered in the production of compact 
fluorescent lamps is that several groups of electrical 
connecting leads extending from several different 
components must be connected together. In order for 
manufacture of the lamps to be economical, it is 
necessary to effect these connections automatically, 
resulting in a multi-stage operation and in the need 
for complicated manufacturing equipment to achieve the 
requisite precision in manufacture. An example of the technique employed when producing 
compact fluorescent lamps is found in U.S. Patent 
specification US-A-4,853,583. This technique involves 
placing over one end of the tube part a cover or cap 
which is provided with inner guide walls which widen 
outwardly in a funnel-like configuration and function 
to guide connecting leads from the electrodes of the  
 
gas discharge tube out towards the side of the cap 
adjacent its end opening. When these connecting leads 
have been inserted into the cap, the ignition device 
and then the capacitor are fitted into the cap with 
the connecting leads bent outwards and, at the same 
time, bent in a manner such as to form two wire bunches, 
each comprising three leads at the upper cap 
opening. The leads are then seized and connected 
together. The cap is closed with a lid subsequent to 
having connected the leads together. This method of 
manufacture requires many manufacturing steps and must 
also be extremely precise in order to ensure that 
assemblage is correct and is thus also expensive. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
method in which compact fluorescent lamps can be 
produced more economically and also which simplifies 
conne
