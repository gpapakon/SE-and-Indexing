<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ammunition of a high specific gravity material, in particular ammunition for which conventionally high specific gravity materials such as lead have been used. The invention relates particularly to the use of a particular high specific gravity material in the manufacture of projectiles for firearms The present invention also relates to a process for the manufacture of such items.In many practical applications where a material of high specific gravity is required, one of the most common materials used for this purpose is the metal lead, which as well as having one of the highest specific gravities of readily available common materials, also has a variety of other physical properties which makes it attractive for particular end uses, among the most hitherto common of these being as (or as a constituent of) projectiles for firearms (e.g. lead shot or copper sheathed lead bullets). Lead also has good chemical stability and is relatively easy to manufacture into end product forms such as those mentioned above.An ideal projectile material for example should have a high specific gravity in order to maintain velocity during flight and thereby maximise range. It should be sufficiently hard to fragmentalise "clay pigeon" targets on impact and to cleanly kill game, but it should also be soft enough to avoid damaging the interior surfaces of gun and rifle barrels and woodworking machinery that might subsequently encounter gunshot embedded in timber. Furthermore, it should not be so brittle as to disintegrate upon impact with hard targets, but instead should exhibit a degree of cohesive plastic yield, thereby minimising the risk of target contamination and of ricochet from solid objects in the field of fire. Advantageously, an ideal projectile material is also resilient enough to reduce recoil of the firearm from which it is discharged.Nowadays, with increasing public awareness of environmental friendliness and prevention of pollution, as well as minimising health risks to animals and humans alike, ideal projectile materials should be non-toxic, biodegradable and recyclable. Thus, toxic firearms ammunition, particularly on shooting ranges, necessitates frequent and expensive cleaning out of target surfaces, with which come health hazards to humans involved in that operation.For many years lead or lead alloys have generally been accepted as being "ideal" high specific gravity materials for applications such as those mentioned above, by reason of their particularly good balance of physical
