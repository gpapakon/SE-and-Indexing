THERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC METHODS BASED ON NEUROTROPHIN^EXPRESSIONThe present application is a continuation-in-part of copending United States application Serial No. 07/898,194, filed on June 12, 1992 which is a continuation in part of copending United States application Serial No. 791 ,924 filed on November 14, 1991.1. INTRODUCTIONThe present invention relates to neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), a newly characterized member of the BDNF/NGF/NT-3 gene family and the therapeutic and diagnostic methods of utilizing neurotrophin-4 in the treatment of neurological disorders.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe nerve growth factor family includes nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), also known as hippocampus-derived neurotrophic factor (HDNF). This family of proteins plays an important role in both the developing and the adult vertebrate nervous system, where they support neuronal survival.Based on the amino acid sequence of the mouse NGF protein (Angeletti, et al., 1973, Biochemistry 12:100-115) DNA sequences coding for mouse and human NGF have been isolated (Scott et al., 1983, Nature 302:538-540; Ullrich et al., 1983, Nature 303:821-825). Comparison of mouse and human NGF showed that the protein is conserved within mammals and in support of this, NGF-like activities have been isolated from several species (Harper and Thoenen, 1981 , Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 

21 :205-229). Subsequently, DNA sequences from bull (Meier et al., 1986, EMBO J. 5:1489-1493); chick (Meier et al., 1986, EMBO J. 5:1489-1493; Ebendal et al., 1986, EMBO J. 5:1483-1487; Wion et al., 1986, FEBS Letters 203:82-86; cobra (Selby et al., 1987, J. Neurosci. Res. 18:293-298); rat (Whittemore et al., 1988, J. Neurosci. Res. 20:403-410); and guinea pig(Schwarz et al., 1989, Neurochem. 52:1203-1209) NGFs were also determined. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was first isolated from pig brain (Barde et al., 1982, EMBO J. 1 :549-553) and subsequently cloned as a cDNA from this tissue (Leibrock et al., 1989 Nature 341 :149- 152). The gene for NT-3 has been isolated from mouse (Hohn et al., 1990,Nature, 344: 339-341), rat (Maisonpierre et al., 1990, Science 247: 1446- 1451 ; Ernfors et al., 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 5454-5458), and human (Rosenthal et al., 1990, Neuron 4: 767-773), using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequence similarity between the other two factors. The three factors show approximately 55% amino acid similarity to each other, and most sequence
