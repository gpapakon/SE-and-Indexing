<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a load selector for step switches in step transformers with two movable selector contacts in which there is a suitable vacuum switch downstream of the first movable selector contact to switch the load current and a suitable switch for switching the compensation current downstream of the second movable selector contact and in which both selector contacts are independently movable in such a way that one of them moves slowly and the other in jumps and their sequence is independent of the switching direction.

Tap selector switch for tapped transformers with two movable 
selector contacts, wherein at least one vacuum switch (SKV), which 

switches the load current and carries this constantly, is connected 
behind the first movable selector contact (SKM) and a switch (HKM), 

which switches the balancing current between two neighbouring taps of 
the tapped transformer and carries this for a short time, in series 

with a switch-over resistor (R), is connected behind the second 
movable selector contact (HKW) and wherein the first and the second 

movable selector contact in the rest position lie at the same tap, 
characterised thereby, that the first movable selector contact (SKM) 

as well as also the second movable selector contact (HKW) are movable 
individually and without direct mutual coupling, that the second 

movable selector contact (HKW) independently of the switching 
direction reaches the new fixed contact (nÂ±1) during each switching 

movement before the first movable selector contact (SKM) leaves the 
previous fixed contact (n), that the second movable selector contact 

(HKW) is continuously actuable directly by a drive shaft and that the 
first movable selector contact (SKM) after the release of a force 

storage device is capable of being made to follow suddenly the 
movement of the second movable selector contact (HKM), wherein the 

force storage device is tensionable by the drive shaft.

selector contact (HKW), for the switching of a balancing current, is 
likewise a vacuum switch (HKV). 
Tap selector switch according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby, that a further vacuum switch (ZKV) is 

connected in series with the vacuum switch (SKV), which switches the

arranged in series are actuable almost simultaneously.

HKW) are borne to be rotatable co-axially and arranged one vertically 
above the other and that the fixed contacts (n to n+m) each extend so 

far in vertical direction that they are wipable by both the movable 
selector contacts (SKM, HKW) each independently of the other. 
Tap selector switch according to one of the claims 1 to 3,

HKW) are guided to be movable linearly each independently of the 
other in such a manner that all linearly arranged fixed contacts (n 

to n+m) are wipable each time. 
Tap selector switch according to claim 5, characterised thereby, 
that the fixed contacts (n to n+m) extend along a linear path into 

the interior of the tap selector switch and are capable of being 
connectable to by a displaceable switching mechanism which is driven 

by a drive shaft standing in connection with a threaded spindle (4), 
that the switching mechanism consists of a tensioning carriage (8), 

which is continuously drivable directly by the threaded spindle (4), 
and a drive output part (11), which is tensionable by this by means of a 

spring energy storage device and which after release suddenly 
follows the tensioning carriage (8), that the tensioning carriage (8) 

is connected with a preselecting auxiliary contact (10), which forms 
the second movable selector contact (HKW), which is bringable into
