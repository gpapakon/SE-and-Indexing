<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a disc cartridge for 
accommodating a disc therein, which comprises a spindle hole 

into which a spindle is inserted to rotate the disc, a head 
insertion hole into which a read and/or write head is inserted 

and which is located adjacent to the spindle hole, and a 
shutter for closing and opening the head insertion hole which 

is slidingly moved along a guide portion formed at a front end 
of the cartridge opposed to a reproducing apparatus, the 

shutter being urged by an elastic member in the direction where 
the head insertion hole is closed, accommodated in an elastic 

member accommodating space having an elastic member insertion 
inlet through which the elastic member is inserted. The disc 

cartridge is improved in that an inner wall of the cartridge 
for defining the elastic member accommodating space has a 

reinforcing rib for reinforcing the inner wall in addition to a 
surrounding wall 
for surrounding the disc when the disc is 
accommodated in the cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc cartridge according to the preamble of claim 1,
especially to a disc cartridge for encasing a recording medium such as an optical disc or
a magnetic disc.In general, a magnetic disc or an optical disc is encased
in a cassette case made of two shell halves. A hole into
which a spindle for rotating the disc is to be inserted is
formed in a central portion of the cassette case. Adjacent
to the spindle hole, a head insertion hole into which a
write and read head is to be inserted is formed in the
radial direction to traverse the recording surface of the
disc. The head insertion hole is opened and closed by a
shutter having an opening corresponding to the head
insertion hole.However, in this disc cartridge, only the head insertion
hole is closed by the shutter in a state wherein the spindle
hole is exposed to the atmosphere. In this manner, if the
spindle hole is exposed to the atmosphere, dust enters
inside the cartridge to contaminate the surface of the disc.Moreover, since an opening of the shutter for opening and
closing the spindle hole is simply formed so as to cut a
rectangle portion of a planar plate of the cartridge, a
write and read head cannot be inserted close to the surface
of the disc when the head is inserted into the head 
insertion hole along the surface of the cartridge.In addition, the shutter is reciprocatingly moved, along
a guide portion of the cartridge, by a drive pin provided in
a recording and reproducing apparatus (player) and, however,
the shutter cannot be smoothly moved because of various
defects of the guide portion thereof.In conventional disc cartridges as disclosed in EP 0 264 237 A3, the shutter for closing
and opening the head insertion hole is usually biased by an elastic member such as a
coil spring towards a position for closing said head insertion hole. The elastic member is
accommodated in an elastic member accommodating space which is defined inside the
cartridge enclosed to the front end of the cartridge, along which the shutter is moved.Owing to the elastic forces of the spring acting on the walls of the cartridge, said walls
close to the guide portion at the front end of the cartridge are deformed. Therefore, the
shutter gets stuck and cannot be moved towards its opened position, so that the
cartridge cannot be inserted duly into a recording and reproducing apparatus such as a
drive of a computer.From a prior art document EP-A2-0 260 876 a disc cartridge casing is known. Said
casing comprises a spindle hole for inserting a

<CLAIMS>
A disc cartridge for accommodating a disc therein, which comprises:

a spindle hole (3) into which a spindle is inserted to rotate the disc (d); a head
insertion hole (4) into which a read and/or write head (H) is inserted and which

is located adjacent to the spindle hole (3); and a shutter (7,40,55,56) for closing
and opening the head insertion hole (4) which is slidingly moved along a guide

portion (G) formed at a front end of the cartridge, opposed to a reproducing
apparatus, the shutter being urged by an elastic member (15) in the direction

where the head insertion hole (3) is closed, accommodated in an elastic
member accommodating space (70) having an elastic member insertion inlet

(71) through which the elastic member is inserted thereinto, 
characterized in
that
 the elastic member has a coil portion (15a) which is moved in the
accommodating space (70) in accordance with opening and closing operation

of the shutter along an arc moving locus, an inner wall of the cartridge for
defining the elastic member accommodating space (70) having a lengthy

reinforcing rib (S) for reinforcing the inner wall and for guiding the coil portion
(15a) thereof along the arc moving locus in addition to a surrounding wall for

surrounding the disc when the disc is accommodated in the cartridge.
A disc cartridge according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcing rib
(S) is provided on each of inner walls for defining the elastic member

accommodating space (70).
A disc cartridge according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcing
rib (S) is formed in the form of an arc extending along a moving locus of the coil

portion of the coil spring.
