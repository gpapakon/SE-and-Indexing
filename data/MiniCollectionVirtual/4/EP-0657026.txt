<ABSTRACT>
An isotopic analysis method using optical emission spectrometry on laser-generated plasma, wherein the sample of interest (10) is exposed to a laser beam (20) to produce a plasma (13), the spectrum of the light from said plasma is analysed, and the isotopic composition of the sample is deduced therefrom.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the analysis of a sample consisting of :

irradiating the sample (10) to be analyzed by a pulse-type laser beam
(20) to produce a plasma (13) on its surface,
analyzing the spectrum (30) of the light emitted by said plasma (13),
deducing therefrom the composition of the sample (10),

characterized in that the analysis is an isotopic analysis and in that
each pulse of the laser beam (20) has an energy equal to or below 10

milliJoules per cm
2
.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the analysis of the
spectrum takes place with a certain time lag relative to the laser pulse.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the time lag is at
least equal to 200 ns.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the analysis of the
light emitted by the plasma relates to a plasma volume at a distance from

the sample surface of at least 0.5 mm.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the sample is of uranium or plutonium.
