<ABSTRACT>
The covering section member (3) comprises a generally U-shaped internal housing delimited by two lateral branches and a transverse upright; the first lateral branch has a coupling or snap-fastening shoulder and is elastically deformable to a first level of deformation, having a thickness (g) smaller than the mean thickness of the section member, at least in the area where elastic deformation is needed; the internal housing comprises a first bearing zone (22a) corresponding to the coupling shoulder or located close to the snap-fastening shoulder, a second bearing zone located on the same side of the internal housing and a third bearing zone located on the second lateral branch and situated at an intermediate distance between the two first bearing zones. The section member (3) covers either a panel (14) or a section member (2) for fixing the panel, after insertion of one or other of these into the internal housing. The combination of the covering section member (3) and the fixing section member (2) constitutes a frame element for the panel.

A section bar for covering the edge of a panel or of a first section 
bar which includes a generally U-shaped inner housing (15) defined by two 

side branches and by a cross-bar, where the first side branch has a 
fastening or snap-fastening shoulder and is elastically deformable at a first 

level of deformation, and the inner housing (15) includes a first bearing zone 
(22a) corresponding to the fastening shoulder or situated close to the snap-fastening 

shoulder (23), a second bearing zone (20a) situated on the same 
side of the inner housing, and a third bearing zone (24a) situated on the 

second side branch (17), characterised in that the first branch is of smaller 
thickness than the mean thickness of the section bar, at least in the zone 

where elastic deformation is required and in that the third bearing zone is 
located at an intermediate distance between the two first bearing zones 

(22a, 20a). 
The section bar according to claim 1, characterised in that its 
cross-section is generally U-shaped, in which the elastically deformable 

first side branch (16) is of a first given thickness (G) and includes a front 
portion (20) that acts as the second bearing zone (20a) close to the cross-bar 

(18), and a rear portion (19) which includes a fastening or snap-fastening 
shoulder (23) and which is of a second thickness (g) that is less 

than the given first thickness (G). 
The section bar according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the end (21) of the elastically deformable first side branch (16) has 

an L-shaped cross-section including one flange (23) that acts as a 
fastening or snap-fastening shoulder, and whose other flange (22) acts as a 

first bearing zone if the shoulder is a snap-fastening shoulder. 
The section bar according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the elastically deformable first side branch (16) includes an outwardly 

directed projection. 
The section bar according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
cross-section of the projection is U-shaped. 
The section bar according to claim 5, characterised in that it is a 
section bar for a pivoting door, with the pivot shaft of said door being 

mounted inside the U-shaped projection (19) of the elastically deformable 
branch (16).  

 
The section bar according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the second side branch (17) is also elastically deformable at a 

second level of deformation, having a thickness that is less than the 
thickness (6) of the first side branch (16) outside its zone of elastic 

deformation. 
The section bar according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
cross-section of the outwardly directed projection is curved in shape, and in 

that it includes an intermediate branch (21b, 94) situated in the inside zone 
of the projection and that supports the second bearing zone (46
a
, 94
a
). 
The section bar according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
intermediate branch (46) is connected to the cross-bar, perpendicularly 

thereto. 
The section bar according to claims 8 and 9, characterised in 
that the intermediate branch (94) is itself elastically deformable at a third 

level of deformation and is obliquely connected to the elastically deformable 
first side branch (92) in the front portion close to the cross-bar (95), said 

first side branch (92) having a first given thickness (H) between the 
connection and the cross-bar (95), and a second thickness (h) that is less 

than the first given thickness (H) between the connection and its own free 

end, the free end (94a) of the intermediate branch (94) constituting the 
second bearing zone. 
The section bar according to claim 1, characterised in that on 
one of its side branches it includes an outside face suitable for receiving a 

sealing element, in particular by means of adhesive and on its other side 
branch it includes a shoulder (30) suitable for co-operating with such a 

sealing element. 
The section bar according to claim 1, characterised in that on 
one of its branches it includes a grooved shoulder (30) suitable for slidably 

receiving a sealing element, and on the other side branch it includes an 
outer bearing face suitable for co-operating with such a sealing element. 
The section bar according to claim 12, characterised in that the 
grooved shoulder (30) slidably receives a decorative strip instead of the 

sealing element. 
A panel frame element comprising two section bars (2, 3), 
namely a panel-fixing first section bar (2) and a covering second section 

bar (3) according to one of claims 1 to 13, said two section bars being  
 

suitable for co-operating with each other, each including an inner housing 
(7, 15), respectively the first (7) for receiving an edge (13) of the panel (14), 

and the second (15) for receiving the first section bar (2), each section bar 
(2, 3) having an elastically deformable branch (5, 16), the first (2) being for 

bearing against the edge (13) of the panel (14) after the edge (13) has been 
forced into the inner housing (17) of said first section bar (2) and the second 

(13) for bearing against the first section bar (2) clamping the edge (13) of 
the panel (14) after the first section bar (2) has been forced into the inner 

housing (15) of said second section bar (3), with the elastically deformable 
branch (16) of the second section bar (3) including a shoulder (23) for snap-fastening
