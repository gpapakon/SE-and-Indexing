<ABSTRACT>
In a pair of stilts, each stilt (12; 80) has a user foot support (14; 82) coupled to an upper leg (18; 84) and to a lower leg (16; 86). The upper leg (18; 84) is secured to the leg of a user. A foot (20; 102) is coupled to the lower end of the lower leg (16; 86). The upper leg (18; 84) includes two side members (18b; 88, 90) each configured to resist torsional forces and thus to provide stability. Each stilt may include a knee protector (124) mounted to the upper end of the upper leg (84) and arranged to prevent hyperextension of the knee of the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN STILTSThis invention relates to stilts.Stilts are well known and are used to increase the height of an individual and to permit the individual to walk from one position to another at an elevated level. Stilts are worn by circus clowns and other entertainers, but specialist stilts may be worn by tradesmen or fruit-pickers who have to work in areas above normal arms-reach and where it is otherwise difficult to install platforms, ladders and the like.In their simplest form, stilts comprise a pair of elongate members, each member supporting a block which provides a platform for a foot of the user. The lower end of each member engages the ground, while the upper end serves as a hand grip. In other versions, the members are strapped to the respective lower legs of the user. Such stilts have traditionally been fabricated from wood. However, various forms of improved stilts are disclosed in my International Patent Publication No. 091/11222. The embodiments of stilts described each have a resilient foot which considerably facilitates walking, particularly when compared with conventional, rigid stilts. In one embodiment the flexible foot is hinged to move laterally as well as back to front and this improves the stability of the stilt and facilitates running and use of the stilts in sports. The disclosed arrangement includes a foot having a flat sole and two upstanding portions which define a longitudinal channel to receive a downward projection on a lower stilt member. The downward projection carries a pivot pin which is received in vertical slots provided in the upstanding projections on the foot. Coil springs are provided at the front and rear of the foot and a shock absorbing rubber pad is also disposed between the top of the sole and the bottom of the 

 leg projection to cushion the wearer whilst walking or running. While this arrangement has been found generally satisfactory it has been found that, on occasion, because the flat sole stays in contact with the ground, lateral movement of the stilt may cause the pivot pin to be dislodged from one of the slots when the stilt is tilted to one side. Also, the arrangement is relatively complex to manufacture.Other forms of stilts provided with resilient feet have been proposed including those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,835,493 and 4,927,137 to R.P. Skaggs et al and Speer, respectively. Skaggs et al disclose a foot arrangement somewhat similar to my own arrangement as described above, but without the provision of a shock absorber, and Speer

CLAIMS
1. A pair of stilts, each stilt (12; 80) having a user foot support (14; 82) coupled to an upper leg (18; 84) and to a lower leg (16; 86) , means (26; 94) for securing the upper leg to the leg of a user, and a foot (20; 102) coupled to the lower end of the lower leg, the upper leg including side members (18b; 88, 90) each configured to resist torsional forces.
2. The stilts of claim 1, in which the upper leg securing means (94) is mounted to a portion of the upper leg (84) at a location to the front of the leg of the user.
3. The stilts of claim 1 or claim 2 in which the upper leg (84) includes a front member (92) extending upwardly from a front portion of the foot support (82) .
4. The stilts of claim 3 in which the side members (88, 90) extend upwardly from rear portions of the foot support (82) to define a triangular configuration of members (88, 90, 92).
5. The stilts of claim 4 in which the lower leg (86) defines an inverted, triangular arrangement of members (96, 98, 100).
6. The stilts of any one of the preceding claims in which the side members (88, 90) are of a relatively thin section and are corrugated or ribbed to provide additional rigidity.
7. The stilts of any one of the preceding claims in which each stilt is of a plastics material, and the members (88, 90, 100) are arranged such that the major 


 structure of each stilt may be formed in a single moulding operation.
8. The stilts of any one of the preceding claims in which each stilt has a resilient foot.
9. The stilts of any one of the preceding claims in which each stilt includes a knee protecting means (124) mounted to the upper end of the upper leg (84) and arranged to prevent hyperextension of the knee of the user.
10. A pair of stilts, each stilt having a user foot support (82) coupled to an upper leg (84) and to a lower leg (102) , means (94) for securing the upper leg to the leg of a user, a foot (86) coupled to the lower end of the lower leg, and knee protecting means (124) mounted to the upper end of the upper leg and arranged to prevent hyperextension of the knee of the user.
11. The stilts of claim 9 or claim 10 in which the knee protecting means (124) is arranged for location in front of the leg of the user and extends above the knee of the user.
12. The stilts of claim 11 in which the knee protecting means (124) includes means (122, 134) for attachment to the leg of the user and includes a link (138, 140) permitting the knee protecting means to flex with the leg of the user.
13. The stilts of claim 12 in which the knee protecting means (124) includes a relatively rigid pad (126) , for protecting the knee of the user from impacts, and upper and lower cuffs (128, 130) pivotally mounted to the pad, the lower cuff (130) being mounted to the upper leg of the stilt. 


 14. The stilts of claim 12 or claim 13 in which the degree of pivoting permitted between the parts (126, 128, 130) of the knee protecting means is restricted by providing movement limiting stops (150, 152) on the parts.
15. The stilts of one of claims 12, 13 or 14 in which the degree of pivoting permitted between the parts (126, 128, 130) of the knee protecting means (124) is restricted by providing slots (142, 144) or channels in one part and followers (146, 148) in another part, the length of the slots or channels limiting movement of the followers and thus limiting relative pivoting of the parts.

17. A pair of stilts, each stilt (12) having a user foot support (14) coupled to an upper leg (18) and to a lower leg (16) and a foot (20) coupled to the lower end of the lower leg, the foot (20) having a longitudinally extending arcuate ground engaging portion (34) and including an upstanding portion (36) received in a longitudinal channel (38) in the lower leg (16) and being pivotally connected thereto for limited movement about a lateral axis (50) , the foot (20) being biassed into a median position by spring means (58, 60), and shock absorbing means (54) being positioned between the upstanding portion (36) and the lower leg (16) .

20. The stilts of any one of claims 16 to 19 in which the walls of the longitudinal channel (38) in the lower legs (16) are configured to define a skirt (76) to substantially enclose the respective upstanding portion (36) and the spring means (58, 60).
21. The stilts of any one of claims 16 to 20 in which the pivotal mounting of each foot (20) on the respective lower leg (16) is provided by a pivot pins (44) extending from the upstanding portion (36) and elongate slots (46) in the leg to allow for vertical movement of the foot (20) relative to the leg.
