<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method according to which 
contaminated acid solutions or chromate solutions can be 

separated into very pure acid and a concentrated solution 
with the contaminations or otherwise an alkaline solution. 

For that purpose the solution to be purified is fed to the 
middle compartment of an electrolytic cell consisting of 

three compartments, which are separated from each other by 
permeable material. Between the middle and the anode 

compartment there is a material which is in any case 
permeable for anions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for purifying an 
acid solution, wherein the latter is fed to an electrolytic 
cell which consists of three adjacent compartments, 
to wit a cathode, a middle and an anode compartment, 
wherein the outer compartments contain a cathode and an 
anode respectively, wherein the separating walls between 
the compartments consist entirely or partially of permeable 
material, wherein a direct voltage is applied over 
the cell with the help of the anode and the cathode and 
wherein there is an electrolyt in the electrode compartments. Methods for purifying contaminated acid solutions are 
known per se. The contaminations consist here of foreign 
cations, mostly metals. When etching metal objects, solutions 
of a strong acid are used, in which the objects dissolve 
slightly. Also when plating (for example electrolytic 
chromic-plating) a part of the metal to be treated 
dissolves. The British 1.411.293 thus describes the removal of metal 
ions from an aqueous acid solution. Use is made of an 
anion selective and a cation selective membrane for removing 
the positive metal ions from the solution. According 
to one embodiment in said patent specification (figure 
4) a chromic acid solution is fed to an anode chamber, 
which chamber is separated by means of a cation selective 
membrane from a middle compartment. This middle compartment 
contains a copper solution, which is a part of a 
coppering apparatus. This compartment is separated from 
the cathode chamber by means of an anion selective membrane, 
where there is an acid solution as catholyte. 
Object of this apparatus is to keep cations out of this 
cathode chamber, to thus prevent deposit thereof on the 
cathode, whilst the anions are kept in the anode chamber.  The contaminations, i.e. the cations, are carried to the 
middle compartment. Another embodiment of the method 
presented in that document (figure 6) is a three-compartment 
system with two cation selective membranes. An etching 
solution consisting of zinc nitrate and nitric acid is 
fed to the middle compartment of an electrolytic cell 
consisting of three compartments, which compartment is 
separated from an anode and a cathode chamber by means of 
two cation selective membranes. In this apparatus the 
cations are removed from the fed etching solution. The 
purified nitric acid remains in the circuit with the still 
contaminated etching solution. The acid solution in the 
anode chamber is for making the catholyte electrically 
conducting. The principle is,
