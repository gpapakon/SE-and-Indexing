<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer 
Mode) cell switching system, more especially one in which information such as 
voices, data, images are divided into each fixed length of 
cell and switched at a very high speed, and in particular 
relates to an ATM cell switching system capable of realizing a 
cell sequence control in the switching process using a 
simplified method. Greatest concerns at the present time in this field are 
directed to the high speed cell switching system in which all 
the information such as voices, data, images are divided into 
cells each of which is a fixed length of packet, the 
information cellulated at a very high speed being transmitted 
and switched using a simplified protocol. For such cell 
switching device used in the high speed cell switching system, 
see the Articles, for example, Aramaki et al "Evaluation of 
Delay in the Cell Distribution Type High Speed ATM Switch" in 
the Proceedings of the 1991 Institute of Electronics  
 
Information, and Communication Engineers, Autumn Meeting, 
B-305. In such Articles there are described a cell 
distributing means provided corresponding to an input port, a 
plurality of cell switching means, and a cell sequential 
aligning means provided corresponding to an output port, where 
the cell distributing means selects one cell switching means 
from among said plurality of cell switching means, and outputs 
the cell given of the time stamp showing the input time to the 
cell switching means, said plurality of cell switching means 
perform the switching processes, the cell sequential aligning 
means outputs to the output port after aligning the cell 
output sequence using the time stamp given to the cell. The conventional cell switching system is described as to its 
structure and operation using block diagrams in Figs. 4, 5, 
and 6 in the present application, assuming that two input lines are provided and 
a cell switching device is formed of two switch circuits. Fig. 4 shows the cell switching device, wherein 400a, 400b 
depicts a cell distributing circuit, 401a, 401b switch 
circuits receiving outputs of the cell distributing circuits 
400a, 400b as inputs respectively, and 402a, 402b cell 
sequence aligning circuits receiving outputs of the switch 
circuits 401a, 401b as inputs. Fig. 5 shows the switch circuit, wherein 501 depicts a time 
division multiplex bus, 502a, 502b address filters connected 
to the time division multiplex bus 501, and 503a, 503b FIFO 
(First In First Out) buffers receiving outputs
