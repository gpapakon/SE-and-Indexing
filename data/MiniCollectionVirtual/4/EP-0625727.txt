<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a reproduction in reduced or enlarged 
size of a halftone original with improved tone rendition by the use 

of a continuous tone correction mask in conjunction with the 
halftone original applied in projection exposure. 
It is a particular characteristic of the present invention that 
said improved tone rendition is obtained by using in said projection 

exposure a mask image, the maximum density (i.e. density at 3 % dot 
value areas of the halftone original used in the projection 

exposure) is linearly directly proportional to the screen ruling of 
the halftone original used in the projection exposure (see Fig. 2 

and 3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a 
reproduction of a halftone original by projection exposure wherein 
measures are taken for an improved tonality rendition of the whole 
tonal scale of the halftone original. In the preparation of photomechanical printing plates 
black-and-white halftone colour separation prints are used as 
photomasks in the production of printing plates for printing with 
subtractive colour printing inks. Inks of the subtractive colours 
cyan, magenta and yellow are used, as well as a certain amount of 
black ink applied by black printer. The amount and distribution pattern of any one of the printing 
inks used in conjunction with the different printing plates for 
multicolour printing depends on the dot size distribution in the 
printing plates, which distribution in turn depends on the dot size 
distribution in the black-and-white halftone colour separation used 
as photomask in the photo-exposure for making the plate. In some cases the available halftone separations need 
enlargement on films or printing plates, e.g. for use in the 
production of large size posters, advertisement panels, large format 
publications or needs reduction or enlargement for adapting the 
format between different publications. The production of halftone separations at reduced or enlarged 
size proceeds usually by projection exposure in a graphic art 
camera. In practice the halftone separations require frequently 
adaptation in size in the range of 70 to 600 % with respect to the 
original. Halftone reproduction by optical projection exposure in an 
enlargement camera is associated with a problem in that a correct 
reproduction of the whole tonal scale of the screen dot pattern of 
the halftone original used in the projection exposure is impossible. 
For example, an exposure dose resulting in a correct reproduction of 
halftone areas having a 50 % dot value results in an overexposure in 
the areas having a % dot value higher than 50, and results in an 
underexposure in the areas having a % dot value lower than 50.  It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for 
producing a reproduction of a halftone original by projection 
exposure wherein measures are taken for an improved tonality 
rendition of the whole tonal scale of the halftone original. According to the present invention there is provided a method 
for producing a reproduction of a halftone original by projection 
exposure comprising the steps of : 
(1) photo-exposing a silver halide emulsion film

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a reproduction of a halftone original 
by projection exposure with improved tonality rendition 

characteristic comprising the steps of : 

(1) photo-exposing a silver halide emulsion film material, 
called mask film, through a halftone image having during the 

exposure the silver halide emulsion layer of the mask film in close 
proximity to said halftone image so that in the mask film a latent 

mask image being a descreened image (i.e. continuous tone image) is 
formed, the photo-exposure dose used for preparing said mask image 

being determined via the linear relationship of the screen ruling of 
said original versus the optical density that the mask has to have 

(for said tonality rendition improvement) opposite an area of the 
original selected in the dot value range of 0 to 10 % dot, 
(2) developing the latent mask image in the thus exposed mask 
film under such conditions that an image of opposite image values 

with respect to the halftone original to be used in the projection 
exposure is obtained and under such conditions that when said close-proximity 

exposure proceeded also through a sensitometric continuous 
tone wedge a wedge reproduction is obtained of which the 

sensitometric curve (Density versus log E) is characterized by a 
Density/Gradient relationship expressed in following 
Table A : 
Density Gradient 0.050.18 0.100.43 0.150.57 0.200.69 0.250.81 0.300.94  

wherein the gradient values may deviate by a factor from 0.5 to 2 
from the values mentioned in said Table A, 
(3) projection-exposing a photo-sensitive printing plate 
material or a silver halide emulsion film material through an 

assemblage of said halftone original in image registration with said 
developed mask film, called correction mask, and 
(4) carrying out high-contrast development of the latent 
enlarged halftone image in the thus exposed film material or photo-sensitive 

printing plate material. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the linear relationship 
of the screen ruling of said original versus the optical density 

that said mask has to have opposite a 3 % dot value area of said 
original is as shown in Fig. 2 herein. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the mask film is a 
negative-working silver halide emulsion film and the original used 

in said projection exposure is a negative of a positive halftone 
separation image used in the production of colour prints. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
contact-exposure for producing said correction mask proceeds with 

diffuse light. 
Method according to claim 4, wherein the production of said 
correction mask proceeds in a contact-exposure apparatus having a 

glass platen covered with a light-scattering translucent resin film 
having thereon in the order given (i) said halftone (screened) 

original, (ii) one or more clear spacer films in the range of 0.1 to 
0.5 mm and (iii) a negative-working silver halide room ligth film, 

all said elements for registration purposes being held by 
registration pins. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the 
exposure in steps (1) and (3) is determined by a programmed computer 

in conjunction with a data memory device.
