<DESCRIPTION>
 STORAGE-STABLE PESTICIDE COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING AZADIRACHTIN AND EPOXIDEBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to storage-stable pesticide compositions and to methods for their preparation. In particular, the invention relates to storage-stable pesticide compositions containing azadirachtin as the active ingredient and an epoxide, preferably an epoxidized vegetable oil, as the stabilizing agent-Extracts of the neem tree (Azadirachta indica) and the chinaberry tree (Melia azeαarach) have long been known to have insecticidal activity (Natural Pesticides from the Neem Tree, Proc. 1st Int'l Neem Conf. 1980, 129 (H. Schmutterer, et al. eds. 1981)); Natural Pesticides from the Neem Tree and Other Tropical Plants, Proc. 2nd Int'l Neem Conf. 1983 (H. Schmutterer and K.R.S. Asher eds. 1984); Natural Pesticides from the Neem Tree and Other Tropical Plants, Proc. 3rd Int'l Neem Conf. 1986 (H. Schmutterer and K.R.S. Asher eds. 1987)). The active ingredient of the neem and chinaberry extracts, azadirachtin, is a limonoid of the tetranortriterpenoid type. Azadirachtin has been shown to be a potent insect growth regulator and feeding deterrent (Yamasaki, R. B. , et al. (1987) J. Agric. Food Chem. 35:467-471) .Azadirachtin is a large and complex molecule. Its molecular weight is 720, and it has a number of reactive functional groups (including ester, epoxide, and vinyl ether moieties) which render the compound unstable in the presence of acids, bases and water.
