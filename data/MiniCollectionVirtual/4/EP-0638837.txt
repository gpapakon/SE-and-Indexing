<ABSTRACT>
The device includes a first optical circulator (C1) connected in series with the line 
(1e, 1u) in order to receive a signal stream including a carrier to be extracted, 

modulated by an information signal, and to transmit a signal stream including the 
same carrier, re-inserted into the stream after having being modulated with another 

information signal, and a second optical circulator (C2) connected to local 
information processing means, to which it supplies the extracted carrier and from 

which it receives the carrier to be re-inserted. Between the two circulators there is 
an optical-fibre bandpass filter (FP) that can be tuned to the carrier wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical communications networks and more 
particularly it concerns a device for extraction from an optical signal stream of a 
carrier, modulated by an information signal, and re-insertion into the stream of 
another carrier at the same wavelength, modulated by a different information signal. Devices of this type can be used for example in wavelength-division multiplexing 
communications networks, for extraction from the line of information for a certain 
user and re-insertion in the line of information generated by the same user. Indeed, 
in such networks information is usually broadcast and selected, i.e., information from 
each user is broadcast to all others, and each user, in order to extract information of 
concern to him, must select a certain wavelength from the set of wavelengths present 
on the line. Another application is found for example in the routing nodes of re-configurable 
optical networks, to re-route certain information streams due to changed 
conditions in the traffic or to by-pass a fault downstream from a node. For the implementation of devices of this type, the use of tunable acousto-optical 
passband filters based on TE/TM polarisation converters was proposed. Examples of 
these are found in the papers "A fully transparent fiber-optic ring architecture for 
WDM networks", by M. I. Irshid and M. Kavehrad (Journal of Lightwave  
 
Technology, Vol. 10, No. 1. January 1992, pages 101-108) and "Wavelength-division-multiplexing 
add/drop multiplexer employing a novel polarisation independent 
acousto-optical tunable filter" (Electronics Letters, Vol. 29, No. 10, May 13, 1993, 
pages 905-907). In particular, the device described in the latter paper is a two-input, two-output 
device including a pair of optical circulators, one of them being connected to the line 
and the other to a local processing device, and a polarising beam splitter-recombiner 
and a TE/TM acousto-optical converter connected between the two circulators. The 
two ports of the converter are connected to the circulators through respective sections 
of polarisation maintaining optical fibres, one of which rotates by 90° the polarisation 
of the beam traversing it. The radiation in the line, usually elliptically polarised. is 
transferred from the first circulator to the splitter-recombiner, that splits it into two 
beams with orthogonal polarisation. The beam with TE polarisation is reflected and 
sent to one of the ports of the converter: the beam with TM polarisation, which is 
transmi
