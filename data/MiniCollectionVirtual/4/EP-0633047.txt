<ABSTRACT>
Evaporator apparatus for treating a waste solution, which 
comprises a closed chamber (24), a drum (25), means (45) for 

maintaining a reduced pressure in said chamber, applicator means 
(32) for maintaining a body of waste solution in contact with said 

drum, a tank (15) for waste solution and pump means (34) for feeding 
waste solution from said tank to said applicator means, heating 

means (31) for heating said drum to cause waste solution applied 
thereto to become concentrated by evaporation to a sludge and 

scraper means (37) for removing said sludge from said drum, said 
applicator means having outlet means (36) for carrying back an 

amount of waste solution from said body to said tank (15) which is

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an evaporator apparatus for 
treating waste photographic solutions, and more in particular to 
those suitable for treating waste solutions discharged as a result 
of the processing of a photographic light-sensitive material. Normally, in a photographic treatment of a photographic light-sensitive 
silver halide material, a monochrome light-sensitive 
material (black-and-white photosensitive material) is developed, 
fixed, and water-washed, whereas a colour light-sensitive material 
(colour photosensitive material) is colour-developed, bleach-fixed 
(or bleached and fixed), water-washed, and stabilised. In the photographic processing of a large quantity of light-sensitive 
materials, any component which has been consumed in a 
photographic processing is replenished. A component which has 
eluted as a result of the photographic processing or a component 
which has condensed as a result of evaporation (for example, bromide 
salts which exist in a developer and silver complex salts which 
exist in a fixing solution) is removed to keep the rate of each 
component of the processing solution to be constant, whereby the 
performance of the processing solution does not vary. In this 
photographic processing, a replenisher is supplied with the 
processing solution and part of the processing solution is wasted to 
remove the concentrated component. In recent years, the amount of processing solution as well as 
of water is strongly reduced in carrying out photographic processing 
in order to avoid environmental pollution and to photographically 
develop at low cost. According to ordinances recently put into force, it is 
permitted to waste water and coolants used for photographic 
processing to sewerages and rivers. However, it is not permitted to 
discharge photographic waste solutions such as a developer, fixing 
solution, colour developer, bleach-fix solution (or bleaching 
solution and fixing solution), and stabilising agent to sewerages 
and rivers. An apparatus which facilitates the treatment of a photographic 
waste solution is proposed in JP-U-70841/1985. According to this 
disclosure, pressure is applied to a photographic waste solution so  
 
as to evaporate, and then, condense or solidify the photographic 
waste solution. When the photographic waste solution is evaporated, 
poisonous gases or gases having an offensive odour such as sulphur 
dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, and ammonia are generated. This is 
because ammonium thiosulphate and sulphites (ammonium salts, sodium

Evaporator apparatus for treating a waste solution, which 
comprises a closed chamber (24), surface means (25) in said chamber 

which is movable about a horizontal axis through an endless path, 
means (45) for maintaining a reduced pressure in said chamber, 

applicator means (32) for maintaining a body of waste solution in 
contact with said surface means, a tank (15) for waste solution and 

pump means (34) for feeding solution from said tank to said 
applicator means, heating means (31) for heating said movable 

surface means to cause waste solution applied thereto to become 
concentrated by evaporation to a sludge, and scraper means (37) for 

removing said sludge from said surface means, 
characterised in that said applicator means (32) has two parallel 

edges, a front edge (69) for the application of waste solution to 
said surface means and a rear edge (71) for carrying back an amount 

of waste solution from said body to said tank (15) which is at least 
equal to the amount of solution applied over said first edge (69) to 

said movable surface means (25) per unit of time. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the amount of waste 
solution being returned to the waste solution tank amounts to at 

least three times the amount of solution applied to the movable 
surface per unit of time.
