<CLAIMS>
Stripper solution for photocrosslinked and 
optionally thermally crosslinked photoresist masks and 

for soldering masks crosslinked by exposure to light and 
heating and containing a diglycol monoalkyl ether, a 

glycol monoalkyl ether, an alkali metal or ammonium 
hydroxide and water as essential components, 

characterized in that it additionally contains 1 - 5% by 
weight of a water-soluble fluoride. 
Stripper solution according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the water-soluble fluoride is an 

alkali metal fluoride. 
Stripper solution according to either of Claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the diglycol monoalkyl 

ether contains an alkyl ether group having 1 to 4 carbon 
atoms. 
Stripper solution according to any of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the glycol monoalkyl ether 

contains an alkyl ether group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. 
Stripper solution according to any of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that it contains 15 to 60% by weight 

of diglycol monoalkyl ether, 10 to 50% by weight of 
diglycol monoalkyl ether, 10 to 30% by weight of alkali 

metal or ammonium hydroxide and 12 to 20% by weight of 
water.
