<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a configuration of a
MIS (Metal Insulator Semiconductor) field effect transistor,
particularly to a high voltage MIS field effect transistor
aimed at withstanding a high voltage. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a technique for integrating this
high voltage MIS field effect transistor together with a
control circuit section to a high density.Conventionally, a planar cell structure shown in Fig.
17 has been adopted to integrate a high voltage MIS field
effect transistor. The high voltage MIS field effect
transistor shown in Fig. 17 is an n-channel-type MOSFET, in
which drain regions 702, which are output terminal regions, are
juxtaposed in parallel on an n-type semiconductor layer, and
these drain regions 702 are surrounded by an input terminal
region 701 constituted by a source layer, gate electrodes, and
the like. A drain pad opening portion 703 is formed at each of
both ends of the drain region 702, and a wire is conductively
connected to the drain pad opening portion 703 to control the
MOSFET. With the MOSFET of the above-described configuration,
however, it is necessary to secure a distance between adjacent
ones of the drain regions 702 by not less than the width of the
drain pad opening portion 703, so that there have been limits
to attain the high integration and low on-resistance of the 
device. Therefore, as a device which has a higher degree of
integration and permits low on-resistance, there is a device in
which the input terminal region 701 and the output terminal
region (drain region) 702 are formed in an interdigitated
shape, and an example of it is shown in Fig. 18. In this high
voltage MOSFET, three drain regions 702a to 702c extend so as
to branch off from the drain region 702 where the drain pad
opening portion 703 is formed, and input terminal regions 701a
and 701b are respectively formed between adjacent ones of these
drain regions 702a to 702c. With the high voltage MOSFET
having the above-described configuration, it is unnecessary to
form drain pads in the respective comb-teeth-shaped drain
regions 702a to 702c, making it possible to form the drain
regions 702a to 702c with a narrow pitch. Since the
enlargement of the channel width can be attained, it is
possible to attain the high integration (a large current
capacity) and low on-resistance of the device.With respect to such a technique of integrating a high
voltage device, a further description will be given by
referring to Figs. 19(a) and 19(b). Fig. 19(a) is a plan view
