<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to impact modifiers for polyamide compositions which improve the impact strength of the polyamides without adversely affecting the flexural modulus of the composition. The impact modifiers comprise blends of halogenated copolymers of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and an alkyl/styrene with a polyolefin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel class of
impact modifiers which can improve the impact strength of
polyamides with little adverse affect on'the flexural modulus
of the polyamide.Toughened thermoplastic polyamide compositions are
known. See for example, U.S. Patent 4,174,358 which
discloses a polyamide matrix and at least one other phase
containing particles ranging from 0.01 to 10 microns of at
least one specified polymer.U.S. Patent 4,350,794 discloses a polyamide
composition by melt blending of a polyamide resin and a
halobutyl composition.EP-A-0404351 discloses a dynamically vulcanised
composition comprising a cured elastomer selected from butyl
rubber, halogenated butyl rubber, a copolymer of a C4 to C7
isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene, ethylene-propylene
copolymer rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene rubber,
polyisoprene, polychloroprene, styrene-butadiene rubber,
nitrile rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene and mixtures
thereof with a thermoplastic polyolefin resin and a solid
particulate component. There is still a need to improve the impact
strength of polyamide compositions, without substantial loss
of the high flexural modulus of the polyamide.It has now been found that the incorporation of
certain polymer blends in polyamide compositions will produce
toughened polyamide compositions having improved impact
strength without substantial loss of the high-flexural
modulus of the polyamide. In accordance with the present invention there is
provided the use of a polymer blend for improving the impact
strength of a polyamide composition, the blend comprising:
(a) a halogen-containing copolymer of a C4 to C7
isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene; and(b) a polyolefin component comprising an
elastomeric polyolefin or a crystalline polyolefin or mixture
thereof.Suitable copolymers of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and
an alkylstyrene which may be a mono or polyalkylstyrene. For
elastomeric copolymer products, the alkylstyrene moiety may
range from about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent preferably
from about 1 to about 20 weight percent and most preferably
about 2 to about 20 weight percent of the copolymer. The
preferred copolymers are copolymers of a C4 to C7
isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene. The copolymers are
described in European patent application 89305395.5 filed on
May 26, 1989, (Publication No. 0344021 published November 29,
1989).The copolymers have a substantially homogeneous
compositional distribution and include the para-alkylstyrene
moiety represented by the formula:
