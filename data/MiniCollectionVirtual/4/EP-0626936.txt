A method of purifying perfluorocarbons or perfluorocarbon 
mixtures with impurities which are hydrogen-bearing and/or which contain 

carbon-carbon double bonds, wherein the perfluorocarbons or perfluorocarbon 
mixtures to be purified are reacted with strong aqueous bases in the 

presence of alcoholate ions and secondary amines, characterised in that the 
reaction is conducted in the presence of Ca
2+
- or Ba
2+
-ions. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
perfluorocarbons to be purified are reacted with the reactants in 

homogenous phase. 
A method according to claims 1 to 2 characterised in that the 
reaction mixture comprising the phases perfluorocarbon/aqueous lye and 

alcoholate/secondary amine is homogenised by means of a tenside. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the reaction mixture is autoclaved at temperatures at least above the 

boiling point of the perfluorocarbon to be purified. 
A method according to claim 4 characterised in that the reaction 
mixture is autoclaved at temperatures of from 150 to 200Â°C. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that 
the reaction mixture is autoclaved at pressures of from 5 to 20 bars. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
the reaction mixture is boiled under reflux under normal pressure. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised in that 
HF is eliminated by strong lyes from incompletely fluorinated, H-bearing 

impurities.  
 
A method according to claim 8 characterised in that the HF-elimination 
operation is conducted in the presence of CaO or BaO or Ca(OH)
2
 
or Ba(OH)
2
, with the formation of CaF
2
 or BaF
2
 which is difficult to 
dissolve. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that 
alcoholate ions are formed by the addition of monohydric alcohol to the 

strong lye, the alcoholate ions further reacting as strong nucleophilics 
with the fluoroolefins formed by HF-elimination. 
A method according to claim 10 characterised in that ROH with 
R = CH

CH is used as the monohydric alcohol. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in that 
tensides which are resistant at the process conditions occurring are used 

for homogenisation of the reaction mixture. 
A method according to claim 12 characterised in that a tenside 
which is known in relation to the production of perfluorocarbon emulsions 

is used as the tenside. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in that 
tensides of the group of the fluorosurfactants, which are resistant in a 

strongly alkaline medium, of the types R

A method according to claim 14 characterised in that the tensides 

are used in a concentration of from 0.05 to 0.5, a maximum of 1.0, percent 
by weight. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 15 characterised in that 
after termination of the entire purification procedure the tenside-bearing, 

aqueous, alkaline phase is re-used. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 16 characterised in that  
 

the perfluorocarbons to be purified are reacted with the reactants in a 
"one-pot" process. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 17 characterised in that 
the perfluorocarbons to be purified are compounds whose lattice structure 

comprises carbon atoms, wherein individual carbon atoms can be replaced by 
oxygen and/or nitrogen and/or phosphorus and/or sulphur and which in 

addition contain exclusively fluorine atoms.
