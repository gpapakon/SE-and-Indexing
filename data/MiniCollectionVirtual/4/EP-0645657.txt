<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connection device for optical fibres (F), comprising a body (10) to be installed between two vertical uprights (1, 2) of a support frame, including a plurality of hinged and superposed cassettes (40a, 40b, 40c, 40d), each comprising means (41, 42, 43) for accommodating lengths of optical fibres in reserve and the splices of the connected fibres. The body (10) includes two side walls joined together at the lower end by a bottom (13). A horizontal support plate (20) is mounted, with the possibility of sliding forwards, above the front wall, between the two side walls of the body, making, with the bottom (13) of the latter, a protected space for breaking-out (fanning-out) the optical fibres. Means (31a, 31d) for guiding the optical fibres in the protected space are designed in order to guide the optical fibres in such a way as to satisfy a minimum radius of curvature.

Connecting device for optical fibres (F), which
comprises:


an elongate rack (10) having two vertical
side walls (11, 12) joined at the bottom by a

horizontal bottom (13), an opening (15) in one of the
side walls of the rack for introducing optical fibres,

as well as a vertical panel (14) for mounting
connectors for connecting the optical fibres to

optoelectronic modules,
a horizontal support tray (20), mounted with
the possibility of sliding forwards between the two

side walls (11, 12) of the rack (10) and providing,
with the bottom (13) of the latter, a protected space

(30) for fanning-out the optical fibres when the tray
is in the rear position, the said space becoming

accessible from above when the tray is brought by
sliding into the forward position, and
a plurality of stacked cassettes (40a, 40b,
40c, 40d), each provided with a lateral inlet (44) and

with a lateral outlet (45) for the optical fibres, and
means for housing reserve lengths of optical fibres and

the splices of the connected fibres, the said plurality
of cassettes being carried by the said support tray,

characterized in that:

the cassettes (40a, 40b, 40c, 40d) are hinged
to each other, the bottom cassette (40a) of the said

plurality being fastened to the support tray (20) and
the other cassettes (40b, 40c, 40d) of the said 

plurality being able to swing to the rear in order to
free the access to a cassette located beneath,
the rack (10) furthermore includes a front
longitudinal wall (14) extending vertically below the

level of the support tray for the cassettes (40a, 40b,
40c, 40d), the said panel for mounting the connectors

for connecting the fibres consisting of the said front
longitudinal wall (14), and
the device furthermore includes means (31a,
31b, 31c, 31d) for guiding the optical fibres in the

said protected space (30), the said means being
designed to guide the optical fibres, while respecting

the minimum radius of curvature, between the opening
(15) in the side wall of the rack, the connecting

connectors having to be mounted in the said front
longitudinal wall, and the lateral inlets (44) and

outlets (45) of the cassettes.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the lateral inlet (44) and the lateral outlet (45)

for the optical fibres are located in each cassette
(40a, 40b, 40c, 40d) opposite each other and the means

for housing the reserve lengths and the splices include
two spools (41, 42), around which the optical fibres

entering via the said lateral inlet (44) and leaving
via the said lateral outlet (45) respectively are

coiled, and a housing (43), located between the two
spools (41, 42), which is intended for stowing the

splices.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the cassettes (40a, 40b, 40c,

40d) are provided at the rear with mounting tabs (46)
formed by bending a raised rear edge (47a) of the

cassette at right angles or moulded as one piece, two
holes (48a, 48b) passing through each mounting tab for

the hinged connection to a cassette immediately above
and to a cassette immediately below, respectively, the

said lateral inlets and outlets for the optical fibres
being formed near the said mounting tabs (46). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the cassettes (40a, 40b, 40c,

40d) are hinged so that they pivot to the rear through
more than 90°.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the cassettes (40a, 40b, 40c)

located under the top cassette (40d) are each provided
with first catching means (49a) and the cassettes (40b,

40c, 40d) located above the bottom cassette (40a) are
provided with second catching means (49b) capable of

engaging with the first catching means, in a removable
manner, in order to fasten the cassettes together, the

first and second catching means being of the type using
a fabric with loops and a fabric with hooks.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the said opening (15) in the rack

is made on one side of the rack below the support tray

includes a guiding piece (50) capable of giving the
optical fibres, outside the rack, a sufficient radius

of curvature during their passage through the said
opening, provided with reversible mounting means on the

rack so that the guiding piece can be oriented
downwards or upwards depending on the direction to be

given to the optical fibres outside the rack.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

opening (15) in an inflected line (201) of which the

concavity, and then the convexity, is oriented towards
a first side wall (12) of the rack on the side on which

U of which the concavity is oriented towards the said

first side wall (12), in a straight line (203) going
