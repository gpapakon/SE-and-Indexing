<ABSTRACT>
An implement for automatically milking animals, 
comprises a milking parlour (1), animal identifying means 

(23) fastened to the animal and cooperating with sensor means 
connected to a computer in order to identify the animal and 

to supply concentrate to the animal in the milking parlour 
(1). The device is further provided with a milking unit (29) 

for automatically milking the animal and, specifically with a 
computer-controlled udder-couplable device (15) with means 

near the udder of the animal for directing one or more 
spraying beams to the teats of the animal. Particularly the 

means for directing one or more spraying beams to the teats 
of an animal comprise one or more nozzles (32, 33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement for 
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a 
milking parlour, animal identifying means fastened to an 
animal and cooperating with sensor means connected to a 
computer in order to identify the animal and to supply 
concentrate to the animal in the milking parlour, the device 
further being provided with a milking unit for automatically 
milking of the animal. Such an implement is known from EP-A-0 091 892. The 
problems that could exist with such machines might be that 
the treatment of the animal is not always satisfactorily, 
particularly the treatment of the udder and of the teats 
could be more gentle. Therefore, and in order to avoid these disadvantages, 
in accordance with the invention the implement is 
characterized in that the implement is provided with a 
computer-controlled udder-couplable device with means near 
the udder of the animal for directing one or more spraying 
beams to the teats of the animal. Specifically the means for 
directing one or more spraying beams to the teats of an 
animal comprise one or more outlet openings for a fluid, i.e. 
a liquid or air, beam. Preferably via said outlet openings 
subsequently a cleaning liquid spray and an air current may 
be applied to the teats of an animal. In a particular embodiment in or at the inner wall 
of the udder-couplable device there is provided at least one  
 
spray nozzle for the cleaning liquid spray and an outlet for 
the air current. In order to realize an overall cleaning of 
the udder a number of spray nozzles is provided to spray a 
cleaning liquid to the teats from several sides. The efficiency of the implement is increased when a 
computer-controlled pumping device is provided to pump the 
cleaning liquid to the udder-couplable device, as well as a 
computer-controlled heating device to heat air and to convey 
the heated air to the udder-couplable device. In order to prevent the cleaning liquid to flow 
over the milking parlour floor the udder-couplable device 
includes a bowl which can be brought in an almost close 
contact around an animal's udder. Preferably, the edge of the 
bowl is provided with a strip of a flexible material. For a 
flexible arrangement of the udder-couplable device in the 
implement for automatically milking animals, the device is 
movable in the horizontal plane, particularly around two 
vertical pins, as well as in the up- and downward direction. In a particular embodiment the cleaning liquid can 
be carried off through the outlet

(15) there is provided at least one spray nozzle (32) for the 
cleaning liquid spray and an outlet (33) for the air current. 
An implement as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that a number of spray nozzles (32) is provided to 

spray a cleaning liquid to the teats from several sides. 
An implement as claimed in any one of the claims 3 
- 5, characterized in that a computer-controlled pumping 

device (20) is provided to pump the cleaning liquid to the 
udder-couplable device (15). 
An implement as claimed in any one of the claims 3 
- 6, characterized in that a computer-controlled heating 

device (19) is provided to heat air and to convey the heated 
air to the udder-couplable device (15). 
An implement as claimed in any one of the claims 3 
- 7, characterized in that the udder-couplable device (15) 

 
includes a bowl which can be brought in an almost close 

contact around an animal's udder. 
An implement as claimed in claim 8, characterized 
in that the edge of the bowl is provided with a strip (46) of 

a flexible material. 
An implement as claimed in any one of the claims 3 
- 9, characterized in that the udder-couplable device (15) is
