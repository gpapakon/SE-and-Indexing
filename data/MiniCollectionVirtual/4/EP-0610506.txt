<ABSTRACT>
Eicosapentaenoic acid or an ester thereof, having a purity as high as at least 99 % and being useful for preventing or treating 
thrombosis, can be obtained in a recovery of 55 % or above by subjecting a mixtur
e of fatty acids or esters thereof obtained 
from a natural fat or oil containing eicosapentaenoic acid or derivatives thereof to precise fractional distillation in a high vacuum 

by using a number of, particularly at least three, distillation columns to obtain a fraction mainly comprising C₂₀ fatty acids or 
esters thereof, and subjecting this fraction to reversed phase column chromatography for fractional purification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method to produce
highly pure eicosapentaenoic acids or their ester. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a novel,
highly efficient method to produce highly pure eicosapentaenoic
acids (EPA) or their ester which is a useful prescription
or the like in the treatment and prevention of
thrombotic disease.It is well known since many years that eicosapentaenoic
acids (EPA), their ester, amid and the like are a useful
prescription in the prevention of thrombus and the treatment
of thrombotic disease.It is also well known that these eicosapentaenoic acids
occur in natural and aquatic oils and fats, such as in
mackerels, sardines, and cods, in particular, per se or as
derivatives such as glycerides. Many published papers
propose a method to separate eicosapentaenoic acids from
these fish oils and the like.Natural fats consisting of these fish oils, however,
contain, in addition to eicosapentaenoic acids of carbon
number 20 and double bond number 5, an overwhelmingly large 
quantity of diverse fatty acids with carbon number ranging
from 12 to 24, and double bond number from 0 to 6. It is
thus very difficult to effectively isolate and refine eicosapentaenoic
acids as a pure product of a high concentration.As one of the methods to isolate and refine eicosapentaenoic
acids, a method to rectify a mixture of fatty acids
containing eicosapentaenoic acids and then refine them by
forming urea adduct is known (publication of unexamined
patent application Nos. 149400-1982 and 8037-1983). With
this method, however, eicosapentaenoic acids are only insufficiently
isolated from other C20 high level unsaturated
fatty acids and intervening C18 and C22 high level unsaturated
fatty acids. with the result that only 95 % pure
products are produced at best. In fact, the method to the
unexamined patent application No. 149400 indicates 93.5 %
purity as the highest achievable level in its working example
3. EPA recovery is also a very low 30 %.The use of reversed-phase partition type column chromatography
is proposed as a means to partition-refine eicosapentaenoic
acids (publication of unexamined patent application
No. 88339-1983). With this method, however, in spite
of using raw materials containing highly concentrated (30 %)
eicosapentaenoic acids, the same quantity of docosa-hexaenoic
acids (DHA) are included in the final product, and these 
two are only incompletely separated, with the result that
the yield of 95 % pure eicosapentaenoic acids is only 40 %.It is thus very difficult

<CLAIMS>
A method for separating eicosapentenoic acids
and/or esters thereof from a mixture of fatty acids

and/or derivatives thereof which comprises:

i) distilling said mixture under reduced pressure
using a plurality of distillation columns so as to

isolate a fraction principally containing C
20
 fatty acids
and/or esters thereof; and
ii) subjecting said fraction to reverse phase column
chromatography so as to obtain eicosapentenoic acids

and/or esters thereof with a purity of at least 95%.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein at least
three distillation columns are employed in step (i) and

distillation is effected at a pressure not exceeding 10
Torr (13,33 hPa) and a temperature not exceeding 210°C.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
distillation is carried out continuously.
A method as claimed in any of the previous claims
wherein the chromatography column employed in step (ii)

contains alkyl-bonded silica packing material.
A method as claimed in any of the previous claims
wherein the mixture of fatty acids and/or derivatives

thereof is derived from natural oils and fats.
A method as claimed in any of the previous claims
wherein eicosapentenoic acids and/or esters thereof are

obtained with a purity of at least 99%.
