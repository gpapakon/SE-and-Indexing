<ABSTRACT>
The invention calls for a store. The invention also calls for a first MOS transistor (T1) which, when a first control signal (S1) is applied, switches an input signal corresponding to the bit to the store input. The store has means for bringing, in dependence on the input-signal level, an output signal at the store output to a pre-determined potential. The circuit is particularly suitable for use in the construction of an address buffer store (address latch) for DRAMs, in particular 16M-generation DRAMs.

Circuit arrangement for latching one bit, 

in which arrangement two circuit branches are provided 
which have a common input (E), 
in which a first circuit branch comprises a first MOS 
transistor (T1) and a first inverter (I1), which are 

connected in series between the input (E) and a first 
output (A1),
