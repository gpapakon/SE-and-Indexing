<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The line testing devices used in correction current systems have high power or energy dissipation. It is the object of the invention to reduce this power or energy dissipation and the associated disadvantages. 2.2. According to the invention, the test circuit consists of the primary winding of a transformer which is arranged between the power supply and the line sections and the secondary winding of which is short circuited, preferably via a switch. The test circuit can also consist of a reactor coil or a capacitor. 2.3. The test device is used for line testing correction current systems, particularly standard gauge railway systems, with respect to their freedom from short circuits.
