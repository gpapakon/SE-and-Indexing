<ABSTRACT>
A thermostatic mixture valve for sanitary installations comprises a slide operated by a handle and allows to regulate the mixture and the flow of water. For easily and precisely adjusting the water temperature within preferred limits, in particular between 30 and 45`C, and for allowing an easy and rational construction, the slide (5) is arranged in parallel to the axis (8) of the case of the mixture valve. This slide (5) is pivoted around an axis (9) which is movable in a parallel direction to the axis (8). The slide (5) is connected through a support element (6), projected out of the body (2) of the mixture valve and set off laterally with respect to the axis (8), to a lever (14) which can move up and down. This lever (14) is hinged to the case of an overhead element (10) which can rotate around its axis.
