<ABSTRACT>
The parallelism of two nominally parallel surfaces is determined by 
placing a planar reflector (50) on one surface and a cube beam splitter (52) on the 

other surface. The reflector is placed to reflect light in a direction normal to the 
plane of the reflector. The cube beam splitter is placed to reflect part of the light 

striking a first face (54) back in the opposite direction. The cube beam splitter also 
reflects part of the incident light towards the reflector so that the reflector reflects the 

light back to the cube beam splitter, causing the light to exit the first cube beam 
splitter face. An autocollimator (10) is provided to direct a beam of light (24) into 

the first face (54) of the cube beam splitter (52) and to display the divergence 
between the first and second reflected beam portions, the divergence corresponding 

to the degree of non-parallelism between the two surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a technique for determining the degree of 
parallelism of two surfaces. In some manufacturing operations there is a need to maintain two 
surfaces substantially parallel to each other within a very high degree of tolerance 
(i.e., a few arcseconds). An example of such a process is the mounting of a small-sized 
semiconductor chip, such as a semiconductor laser chip, to a mounting surface, 
i.e., a substrate or the like. Typically the semiconductor chip, which may be on the 
order of 10 mils x 10 mils, is mounted such that each of a plurality of conductive 
members (i.e., solder bumps or the like) on the undersurface of the chip is to he 
brought into registration with a corresponding bonding pad on the substrate. 
Thereafter, a reflow operation is conducted to bond the chip to the substrate. The planarity (i.e., parallelism) of the semiconductor chip with the 
substrate is critical in order to assure that each mounting pad on the chip makes 
aligned contact with a corresponding bonding pad on the mounting surface. Even a 
small degree of non-planarity between the chip and the substrate can adversely affect 
the reliability of the resultant electrical connection. Often, the semiconductor laser 
chip is relatively expensive so achieving a high degree of parallelism during 
assembly is critical if scrap is to be minimized and costs are to be controlled. The planarity of the chip with the substrate is also critical for another 
reason. Often the chip itself is very delicate, especially when the chip is fabricated 
from III-V or similar compounds which are brittle and tend to have poor mechanical 
integrity, when compared to the mounting substrate which is often made from silicon 
or diamond. When the chip is relatively brittle as compared to the mounting 
substrate, a lack of planarity between them can cause the chip to fracture or 
otherwise become damaged when mounting is attempted. The planarity of the chip with the substrate is generally controlled by the 
mechanism used to place the chip on the substrate. Typically, a vacuum pickup tool, 
having a flat pickup surface, is manipulated by a robotic arm or semi-automatic 
device to pick up the chip and place it on the substrate which is securely held on a 
flat, rigid mounting base. Usually, the orientation of the pickup tool can be adjusted  
 
to achieve planarity (within a prescribed tolerance) of the chip with the substrate. In 
the past, a laser interferometer has been required to measure the planarity of the 
pickup tool and

A method for determining the parallelism of first and second spaced-apart, 
nominally parallel surfaces, CHARACTERIZED BY the steps of: 

   rendering the first surface reflective; 
   directing an incident beam of light; 

   placing a reflecting member on the second surface so as to remain there 
and reflect a first portion of the incident beam in a first direction and reflect a second 

portion of the incident beam at the first surface so as to strike the surface and be 
reflected onto the reflecting member for reflection thereby in nearly the same 

direction as the first reflected beam portion when the first and second surfaces are 
nearly parallel to each other; and 

   detecting the degree to which the first and second beam portions diverge 
from each other, the divergence corresponding to the degree on non-parallelism 

between the first and second surfaces. 
The method according to claim 1 wherein the non-parallelism of the 
first and second reflected beam portions is detected by the steps of: 

   directing the first and second reflected beam portions into an 
autocollimator within which the first and second beam portions are made to appear 

divergent to the extent that the beam portions are non-parallel to each other: 
   observing, via the autocollimator, the degree of divergence between the 

first and second beam portions. 
The method according to claim 1 further including the step of 
adjusting the orientation of a separate one of the first and second surfaces until the 

first and second beam portions are nearly perfectly parallel to each other. 
The method according to claim 2 further including the steps of: 
   coupling a television camera to the autocollimator to electronically 

image the divergence of the first and second reflected beam portions; and 
   automatically processing the output signal of the camera to determine 

the degree of divergence between the first and second reflected beam portions. 
The method according to claim 4 further including the step of 
adjusting the orientation of a separate one of the first and second surfaces in 

accordance with the degree of divergence between the first and second beam 
 

portions. 
Apparatus for determining the degree of parallelism of first and second

surface within the beam of light generated by the autocollimator for reflecting a first 

portion of the collimator beam along a first direction so as to be within the field of 
view of the collimator and reflecting a second portion of the beam at the first surface 

for reflection therefrom onto the reflecting member so as to be reflected by the 
reflecting member along a direction nearly the same as the first direction when the 

first and second surfaces are nearly parallel; 
   the autocollimator receiving the first and second reflected beam portions 

and displaying the divergence, if any, therebetween.

   a television camera for capturing the image of the divergence of the first 

and second reflected beam portions as displayed by the autocollimator; and 
   a machine vision processor for processing the output of the camera to 

determine the degree of divergence between the first and second reflected beam 
portions.

comprises a cube beam splitter. 
The apparatus according to claim 6 wherein the reflecting member 
comprises a block having a first reflective surface positioned opposite to the 

autocollimator for reflecting the first beam portion, and having a second reflective 
surface which slopes upwardly at a precise 45° angle from the first surface for 

reflecting the second beam portion.
