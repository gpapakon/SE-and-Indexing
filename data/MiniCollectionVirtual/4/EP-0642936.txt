<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire having a tread, a pair of 
sidewalls each terminating in an annular bead area, and a 

pair of beads located within the bead areas, for mounting 
the tire on a rim. Each of the beads is formed by at least 

one strand of metallic wire wound upon itself into a spiral 

and terminating in inner and outer ends, which ends 
circumferentially overlap each other. The beads are placed 

in the tire so that the spiral orientation of the beads are 
opposite to each other and the inner ends of the beads are 

in substantial axial alignment to reduce radial force 
variations on the tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pneumatic tires and in 
particular to the bead area thereof. More particularly, 
the invention relates to the orientation of the beads and 
the bead configuration in a tire in order to increase tire 
performance by reducing radial force variations on the 
tire. Even more particularly, the invention relates to a 
pneumatic tire in which the pair of beads are spirally 
wound and the inner circumferential ends of the beads are 
spotted together with the spirals being opposite to each 
other when mounted in the tire. All tire manufacturers are striving to produce the 
most efficient and effective tire, one that will have long-wearing 
characteristics and the most satisfactory ride to 
the vehicle occupants. Any nonuniformity forces in a tire 
affects its efficiency and ride characteristics, and it is 
known that each component of a tire, including beads, 
contributes to subte force variations in a rolling tire. These force variations require scrapping of the 
tire if they become excessive or the grinding off of 
certain portions of the tire to balance out the force 
variations, all of which are time consuming and increases 
the production costs of the tires. Uniformity studies have revealed that the beads 
of a tire affect the radial force variation factors on the 
tire, especially when spotted box bead configurations are  
 
utilized. These box bead configurations usually consist of 
a plurality of individual strands of metal wire which are 
wound upon themselves into a spiral configuration, which 
are then placed in axial abutment in forming the final tire 
bead. The outer and inner ends in each of the individual 
strands in a single bead have been placed in axial 
alignment for ease of manufacture. However, it was not 
known that the direction of spiral of the opposed beads 
with respect to each other in a tire, materially effected 
various force variations. Various prior art bead constructions and making 
of same are shown in the following U.S. patents. U.S. Patent No. 1,503,985 discloses a bead that 
is embedded in the bead portion of a tire casing, in which 
the bead is formed from a single continuous strip of sheet 
metal of spiral form with adjacent layers decreasing in 
their width, forming a substantially triangular-shaped 
bead. U.S. Patent No. 3,974,870 discloses a tire having 
different diameters for the annular beads to provide 
improved lateral stability. U.S. Patent No. 5,099,902 discloses a bead formed 
from a wound helical wire having an offset in the 
individual

<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic tire construction comprising 
a tread (2), a pair of sidewalls (3), each terminating in an 

annular bead area (4) for mounting the tire on a rim, and first 
and second annular beads (5,6), each contained within a 

respective one of the bead areas and being coaxially spaced 
with respect to an axial centerline of said tire, each of 

said beads including at least a single strand (8) of metallic 
wire wound upon itself into a spiral and terminating in an 

outer end (10) located on an outer circumference of the spiral 
and an inner end (9) located on an inner circumference of the 

spiral; said inner and outer ends of each strand 
terminating in a circumferential overlapped relationship, 

characterized by the inner end (9) of the first bead (5) being in 
substantial axial alignment with the inner end (9) of the second bead (6), and 

with the spiral orientation of the first bead being 
opposite to the spiral orientation of the second bead. 
The pneumatic tire construction defined in 
Claim 1 in which 

the amount 
of overlap in both beads are substantially equal to each 

other. 
The pneumatic tire construction defined in 
Claim 1 in which the strand of metallic wire is embedded in 

rubber. 
The pneumatic tire construction defined in 
Claim 1 in which a plurality of individual strands of 

metallic wires lie in an axially side-by-side relationship, 
each of said strands being wound upon itself into a spiral 

and terminating in inner and outer ends  
 
The pneumatic tire construction defined in 
Claim 1 in which the strand of metallic wire is circular 

in cross section.
