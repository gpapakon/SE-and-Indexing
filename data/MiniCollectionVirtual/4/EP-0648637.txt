<ABSTRACT>
A refuelling vapour recovery system for a 
vehicle utilises recirculation of a portion of the 

displaced vapour and combines a vapour vent valve and 
a recirculation control into a single differential 

pressure valve assembly (50). A vapour vent conduit 
(61) provides fuel tank vapour pressure to one side of 

a diaphragm (58) and, through a restricted orifice 
(76), to the other side of the diaphragm, the other 

side being further connected by a recirculation 
conduit (75) to the tank filler neck (16). When a 

filler cap (17) closes the filler neck from the 
atmosphere, the orifice allows pressure to equalise 

across the diaphragm; and a spring (68) biases the 
diaphragm to close a vapour vent valve (66). When the 

filler cap is removed, atmospheric pressure is 
provided through the recirculation conduit to the 

other side of the diaphragm, which can then be 
activated by a relatively small differential pressure 

to open the vent for relatively unrestricted vapour 
flow from the tank (10) to a canister (40) during 

refuelling, with a small portion of the vapour 
recirculated in a controlled flow through the orifice 

and recirculation conduit to the filler neck for 
entrainment in incoming liquid fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for 
recovering the vapour displaced from a fuel tank 
during fuel fill using valve apparatus for control of 
vapour flow to a storage canister and recirculation of 
a portion of the vapour via the fill pipe. Emission control standards for vehicle fuel 
systems are now beginning to require recovery of fuel 
vapours displaced from a vehicle fuel tank during 
refuelling. US-A-4,762,156 discusses the use of a 
liquid seal in a fuel fill pipe with a vapour 
recirculation system to replace air which would 
otherwise be drawn into the fill pipe and entrained by 
the inrushing fuel. Such entrained air has been shown 
to increase the generation of vapour within the tank 
during refuelling through liquid seals; and the 
additional vapour would necessitate a larger storage 
canister. The apparatus of US-A-4,762,156 uses a 
vapour vent valve actuated during refuelling to allow 
a flow of displaced vapour to a storage canister and a 
separate recirculation valve apparatus effective to 
recirculate a portion of the displaced vapour to the 
fuel fill pipe at the filler neck for entrainment in 
the inrushing fuel at a rate depending on the rate of 
fuel flow. The vapour so entrained reduces the air 
drawn into the fill pipe by the inrushing fuel; and 
this reduces the tendency for additional vapour to 
form in the process. A vapour recovery system in accordance with 
the preamble of Claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-4,714,172. 
A vapour recovery system in accordance 
with the present invention is characterised thereover 
by the features specified in the characterising 
portion of Claim 1.  This invention is a refuelling vapour 
recovery system for a vehicle which utilises 
recirculation of a portion of the displaced vapour and 
combines a vapour vent valve and a recirculation 
control into a single differential pressure valve 
assembly. The differential pressure valve assembly 
comprises a housing defining first and second chambers 
separated by a diaphragm carrying a valve member. An 
internal conduit has a valve seat engageable by the 
valve member in response to excess pressure in the 
second chamber overcoming a biasing spring. A vapour 
vent conduit connects a vapour collection region of 
the fuel tank with the first chamber; and a vapour 
recovery conduit connects the internal conduit with 
the vapour storage canister. A vapour recirculation conduit communicates 
the first chamber of the valve assembly with the 
filler neck and the second chamber through a 
restricted orifice. The
