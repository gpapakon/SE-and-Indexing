<CLAIMS>
Filler body (1) for acoustic and thermal sealing of 
hollow spaces in vehicle bodies, constituted as a molded 

part of resilient, porous material (4) of sufficient 
restoring resilience, enveloped in foil, which is subjected 

to a vacuum prior to introduction into the hollow space 
(5), characterised in that the molded part is self-supporting 

and has, in the direction of introduction, which 
is perpendicular to the plane of installation, a large 

bending stiffness by virtue of a flat, thin intermediate 
layer (3). 
Filler body (1) as molded part according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the body is triple-layered, whereby 

the resilient, porous material (4) of sufficient restoring 
resilience can completely surround the intermediate layer 

(3) or can match the edges of the intermediate layer. 
Filler body (1) as molded part according to claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that it contains an intermediate layer 

(3) sections of which are twisted one to another, whereby 
however the sections should not be separated from one 

another. 
Filler body (1) as molded part according to any of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it seals arbitrary 

hollow spaces (5) which merely have 2 surfaces spaced apart 
from one another and after removal of the vacuum is brought 

into a fit by the restoring forces. 
Filler body (1) as molded part according to any of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it is applied at 

vehicle body regions (5) which are poorly accessible and 
formed in a spatially complicated fashion. 
Filler body (1) as molded part according to any of  
 

claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it contains self-supporting 
material as intermediate layer (3), such as for 

example cardboard. 
Filler body (1) as molded part according to any of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the intermediate layer 

(3) is secured against displacement. 
Filler body (1) as molded part according to any of 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that it has a form which is 

per se arbitrary, preferably however flat, elongate and 
bent.
