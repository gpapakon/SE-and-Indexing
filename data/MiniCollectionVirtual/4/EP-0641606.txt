<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a transducer array (4) with a plurality 
of piezoelectric elements (11) having a minimum and maximum 

thickness. In one embodiment, the maximum thickness is 
less than or equal to 140 percent of the minimum 

thickness. In an alternate embodiment, the maximum 
thickness is greater than 140 percent of the minimum 

thickness and the transducer array (4) is capable of simulating 
the excitation of a wider aperture twodimensional 

transducer array. One or more matching layers (24,22) may be used 
to further increase bandwidth performance. In addition, a 

two crystal transducer element as well as a composite 
transducer structure may be formed using the principles of 

this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transducers and more
particularly to broadband phased array transducers for
use in the medical diagnostic field.Ultrasound machines are often used for
observing organs in the human body. Typically, these
machines contain transducer arrays for converting
electrical signals into pressure waves. Generally, the
transducer array is in the form of a hand-held probe
which may be adjusted in position to direct the
ultrasound beam to the region of interest. Transducer
arrays may have, for example, 128 transducer elements for
generating an ultrasound beam. An electrode is placed at
the front and bottom portion of the transducer elements
for individually exciting each element, generating
pressure waves. The pressure waves generated by the
transducer elements are directed toward the object to be
observed, such as the heart of a patient being examined.
Each time the pressure wave confronts tissue having
different acoustic characteristics, a wave is reflected
backward. The array of transducers may then convert the
reflected pressure waves into corresponding electrical
signals. An example of a previous phased array acoustic
imaging system is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,550,607
granted November 5, 1985 to Maslak et al.
That patent
illustrates circuitry for combining the incoming signals 
received by the transducer array to produce a focused
image on the display screen.Broadband transducers are transducers capable
of operating at a wide range of frequencies without a
loss in sensitivity. As a result of the increased
bandwidth provided by broadband transducers, the
resolution along the range axis may improve, resulting in
better image quality.One possible application for a broadband
transducer is contrast harmonic imaging. In contrast
harmonic imaging, contrast agents, such as micro-balloons
of protein spheres, are safely injected into the body to
illustrate how much of a certain tissue, such as the
heart, is active. These micro-balloons are typically one
to five micrometers in diameter and, once injected into
the body, may be observed via ultrasound imaging to
determine how well the tissue being examined is
operating. Contrast harmonic imaging is an alternative
to Thallium testing where radioactive material is
injected into the body and observed by computer generated
tomography. Thallium tests are undesirable because they
employ potentially harmful radioactive material and
typically require at least an hour to generate the
computer image. This differs from contrast harmonic
imaging in that
