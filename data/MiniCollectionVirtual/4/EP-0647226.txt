<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the use of 9-aminopyridazino(4',5' : 3,4)pyrrolo(2,1-a)isoquinolines of formula (I), plus their physiologically tolerated salts with acids and complex-forming agents, in the preparation of agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory processes, ulcerous colitis and Crohn's disease, and in the preparation of agents with an anti-proliferative action. The substituents R1 to R9 are as defined in the description. The invention also concerns compounds of general formula (I), which are also defined in the description, and their use as brain-protective agents.
