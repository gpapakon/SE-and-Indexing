<ABSTRACT>
Method of removal of paint etcetera from a timber element, e.g. a window frame or a door leaf, comprising a step during which the element is inserted into an oven, in which at least the paint and the outer layer of the timber is heated, and a step carried out soonest thereafter, in which step paint and/or similar material such as e.g. putty is mechanically removed utilizing as such known technique before the element has been cooled to room temperature. Equipment for carrying out the method is also disclosed. The method makes possible saving of labour and - in a specific embodiment - reuse of glass panes mounted in the element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of mechanical removal
of an adhering agent such as paint and putty from
window frames and other timber elements and comprising a
step in which the adhering agent is heated. The invention
also relates to equipment for carrying out the invention.When carrying out restoration and renovation work on timber
elements such as but not solely window frames and doorleaves
part of the work to be done is very often removal of old adhering
agents. This work is cumbersome and time consuming.
Many methods of mechanical removal of adhering agents are
known.Removal of adhering agents by mechanical means only for the
laying bare of the timber surfaces is time consuming and
consequently costly. Such tooling also implies considerable
risk of damage, especially of profiled carpentry.The risk of damaging the carpentry work is reduced if the
paint is softened.Softening may be obtained by heating the adhering agent.
Heating by means of a flame or a hot air jet lends considerable
easing for the mechanical removal. The controlling of
the flame or of the hot air jet, however, is difficult, and
damages caused by over heating are often seen. Performing
individuals get burns easily, and excessive heating creates
unpleasant and health influencing exhalations.Mobile pieces of carpentry work or such timber elements
which can be dismantled can alternatively be treated by being
soaked in a strong alkaline solution or an acid. These
mediums are water based and are often damaging the carpentry 
work treated, not least any glued joints. Timber is often
distorted.Latest known, from window renovation in Denmark, is a removal
method according to which the wooden element is soaked
and heated in very hot linseed oil. The method is claimed to
provide a good removal and at the same time an advantageous
impregnation of the timber. A method which is using very hot
oil must produce inconvenient vapour which has to be removed
by ventilation. Drippings of hot linseed oil must cause a
filthy place of work and cumbersome cleaning of the working
area. Even though linseed oil as such implies no special
risk, it is well known that absorbing paper or textile
moistened with linseed oil may ignite spontaneously. A risk
which is undesirable in any carpentry shop. Old craftsman's
experience recognises risk of oil sweating through later
applied paint cover in case soft wood such as pine has been
impregnated with linseed oil.DE-A-3 518 725 discloses a method for pyrolytic removal of
lacquer residuals on metal elements by

<CLAIMS>
Method of mechanical removal of adhering agent in the
form of paint or putty from a timber element such as a window

frame or a door leaf and comprising a step in which the
adhering agent is heated, 
characterized
 by a
step in which the adhering agent to be removed and at least

the outer layer of the timber to which the adhering agent
adheres are heated influenced by microwave radiation, and by

a step in which mechanical removal of heated adhering agent
is carried out by per se known mechanical removal technique,

before the element is cooled to ambient temperature.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized

by removal of only part of the agent, and by the repeating
of both of the steps or by removal of remaining agent utilizing

any other method.
Equipment for carrying out the method of mechanical removal
of an adhering agent in the form of paint or putty from

a timber element and comprising a step in which the adhering
agent is heated, according to at least one of the claims 1

or 2, 
characterized
 by a microwave oven with
an oven chamber able to hold the timber element witho
ut
direct mechanical contact to the inner surfaces of the oven

chamber, and by an adhering agent removal station comprising
mechanical removal equipment.
Equipment according to claim 3, 
characterized

by being designed to be mobile.
