<ABSTRACT>
Improvements in female electrical contact members formed by a body (1), one end of which takes the shape of a channel (6) with a rectangular cross-section, this channel being intended to receive a male terminal blade (13) and having two opposite sidewalls from each of which is cut a resilient (springy) blade (11, 14) extending towards the inside of the channel (6) so as to form a resilient clamp and a spring element (2) interacting with the resilient blades (11, 14), characterised in that the spring element (2) has two pairs of branches (17, 18) (20, 21), each branch of a pair of branches being connected to the other by a sharply bent part (23, 24), each pair of branches and the corresponding sharply bent part being intended to interact with the external face of the corresponding resilient blade (11, 14), and at least one of the free ends of a branch of each pair including means which are conjugate with corresponding means on the body (1) for its attachment to the latter.
