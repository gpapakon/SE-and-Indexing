<ABSTRACT>
Original input unit, copy processing content 
instruction unit, and copy processing execution unit, which 

respectively function independently of each other, are arranged 
to be dispersed in a network. The information pertaining to 

the copy original such as image data is inputted by the 
original input unit. The contents of the copy processing such 

as the number of copies, enlargement, reduction, etc. are 
inputted by the copy processing content instruction unit. When 

the start button is clicked, the inputted image data and the 
instructed contents relating to copy processing are transmitted 

to the copy processing execution unit via the network so as to 
execute the copy processing in accordance with this 

information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dispersed copying
system, and more particularly relates to a dispersed copying
system according to the preamble of claim 1.Copiers have been in use for a long time. After then,
the various types of OA equipment (office automation equipment)
such as word processors, personal computers, and work stations
came into use, but copiers remain as the most basic of OA
machines.This is because copiers are the most accessible of OA
machines for us. They can be operated by anyone, and are used
quite frequently on a daily basis. Furthermore, the contents
of the documents represented on paper or film can be subjected
to processing such as enlargement or reduction according to
necessity to output in a simple manner.This type of processing can also be performed by other
OA machines. For example, work stations and personal computers
can also perform enlargement and reduction of image data. In
such cases, however, these operations are conducted by linear
conversion processing relative to dot data, and their
processing mode differs from that of copiers wherein the
operations are conducted by manipulation of lens magnification 
(conventional copiers), or by manipulation of beam scanning
speed and drum rotational speed (digital copiers). There are
also disparities between the two with regard to the corrective
processing accompanying magnification changes, the resolution
and contrast of the image which is the object of processing,
the processing speed, etc.In the present specification, all processing performed
by these types of copiers are referred to under the general
appellation of "copy processing." This copy processing
includes not only the essential copy processing-- that is,
recording of the image onto the medium by the formation of the
electrostatic latent image, development, transfer, and fixing--
but also processing relating to the image such as enlargement
and reduction, processing such as double-sided printing and
stapling, and all other processing performed by today's
copiers.A copier roughly has 3 parts. The 3 parts are the part
which reads the original image, the part which indicates the
contents of the copy processing such as the number of copies,
and whether or not there is to be enlargement or reduction, and
the part which actually executes the designated copy
processing.Conventionally, these respective parts have been
integrated. As a result, one cannot use a copier unless one
leaves one's chair and walks over to it, and if one finds
another person using it, one has to
