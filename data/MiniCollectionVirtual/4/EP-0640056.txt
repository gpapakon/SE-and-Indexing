<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refuse collection
apparatus, and more particularly to an articulated refuse
collection vehicle. In a further and more specific
aspect, the present invention concerns the use of a roll-off
semi-trailer including a removable refuse collection
body removably carried thereby.The collection and removal of refuse, the solid
waste of a community, is a major municipal problem. For
example, residential refuse is generated at an average
rate of approximately two pounds per day per capita.
Other wastes, from commercial or industrial generators,
typically add another pound. As accumulated, loose and
uncompacted, the refuse has a density generally in the
range of 150 to 300 pounds per cubic yard. For the
health and welfare of the community, regular disposal is
imperative.Traditionally, residential refuse, including
garbage, trash, and other waste materials were amassed
and stored in containers of approximately 10 to 30 gallon
capacity. On a regular basis, usually once or twice
weekly, the containers were placed by the householder at
a designated location for handling by the scheduled
collection agency. Frequently designated locations were
curb side and alley line. Not uncommonly, the refuse of
a single residence, depending upon the number of
occupants and the frequency of service, would occupy two
or more containers, each weighing as much as 75 to 100
pounds. Commercial or industrial generators accumulated
waste in larger, heavier containers. Conventionally, these refuse containers were emptied
into a refuse collection vehicle which transported the
refuse to a disposal site. Disposal sites could be
landfills, dumps, incinerators, et. cetera. The
conventional refuse collection method involved a
mechanized unit supplemented with manual labor. The
mechanized unit, or collection vehicle, included a refuse
handling body mounted upon a truck chassis. Generally,
the vehicle was attended by a crew of three or more. One
of the crew, the driver, attended to operation of the
vehicle while the others, known as collectors, brought
the refuse to the vehicle.Commonly, the vehicle included a hopper of
conveniently low loading height into which the collectors
emptied the containers. Means were provided for
transferring and compacting the refuse from the hopper
into the body. The body also included unloading means
for ejecting the refuse at the disposal site.Recently, considerable effort has been devoted to
developing devices which increase the speed and
efficiency with which refuse is collected. The

<CLAIMS>
An articulated refuse collection vehicle (10) for collecting and
transporting refuse comprising:


a) a collection towing vehicle (13) including;

i) a chassis (14) having a rearward end (17) and a forward end
(15);
ii) a fifth wheel (25) carried by said chassis (14) proximate said
rearward end (17);
iii) a cab (24) carried by said chassis (14) proximate said
forward end (15);
iv) a refuse loading mechanism (27) carried by said chassis (14)
intermediate said cab (24) and said fifth wheel (25) for emptying refuse

containers above said fifth wheel (25); and
b) a semi-trailer (12) rotatably and removably coupled to said fifth
wheel (25) of said towing vehicle (13) comprising:


i) a chassis (40) having a forward end (42), a rearward end
(43), and a frame (47) carried by rear wheels (48) proximate said

rearward end (43);
ii) a king pin coupled to and extending downward from said
chassis (40) proximate said forward end (42), said king pin rotatably and

removably received by said fifth wheel (25); and
iii) a refuse collection body (50) carried by said chassis (40),
said refuse collection body (50) including a storage receptacle (52,53,54)

having a forward end and a rearward end;
characterised in that said semi-trailer (12) includes:


a) a hopper (57) coupled to said forward end of said
storage receptacle (52,53,54), said hopper (57) being positioned directly

above said king pin for receiving refuse; 
b) a compactor (58) carried by said hopper (57); and
c) a tailgate assembly (55) coupled to said rearward end
of said storage receptacle (52,53,54).
An articulated refuse collection vehicle (10) as claimed in claim 1
wherein said semi-trailer (200) further includes:


a) roll-off rails (210) mounted on said frame (205) for receiving
said refuse collection body (50);
b) a winch mechanism (218) coupled to said frame (205); and
c) a hoist mechanism (209) coupled to said frame (205).
An articulated refuse collection vehicle (10) as claimed in claim 2
wherein said hoist mechanism (60,209) includes:


a) a first and a second generally L-shaped member (80) each
having a main portion (82) and a leg portion (85), said main portion (82)

and said leg portion (85) each include a terminal end (83,87) and an
opposite end (84), with the opposite ends being attached so as to form an

angle therebetween;
b) said terminal ends (83) of each said main portions (82) being
