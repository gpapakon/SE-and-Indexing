<ABSTRACT>
Optical distance sensors are used to produce a height raster image for inspecting complex units, e.g. equipped printed circuit boards. The prior art triangulation method or confocal principle may be used for this purpose. A sensor permitting complete inspection within an acceptable time must have a correspondingly high data rate. To this end a distance sensor is described which has both high resolution and low sensitivity to secondary light reflexes. The essential characteristics comprise: 1) a substantially larger diameter measuring beam (19) relative to the lighting beam (18); 2) an approximately equal diameter of both beams at the point of measurement, the lighting beam (18) have a greater depth of focus (T) than the measuring beam (19); 3) a beam dividing unit (154) for dividing the measuring beam (19) with approximately point-shaped photodetectors in each partial beam, arranged one behind the other in the direction of the partial beams and the height within the depth of focus (T) is recognisable by the photodetector according to greatest light intensity.
