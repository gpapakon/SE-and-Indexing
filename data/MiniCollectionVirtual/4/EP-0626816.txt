<ABSTRACT>
The spectacles fastener (301) proposed has a cross-shaped clip (305) to which are fixed two moulded elements (341) designed to hold the spectacles in place and to secure the fastener (301) to the breast pocket of an item of clothing (317). The moulded elements (341) can be pushed on to the ends (312) of the horizontal bar (309) of the clip and adapted to the size of the spectacles concerned. Fixed to the vertical bar (307) of the clip is a spring element (308) by means of which the fastener (301) can be secured to the breast pocket of to some other part of an item of clothing.

<CLAIMS>
A fastener (1, 101, 201, 301) for a pair of
spectacles (25, 125), with a clip (5, 105, 205,

305) for fixing the holding device for a pair of
spectacles and for clamping into place the

fastener (1, 101, 201, 301) to a garment or a
carry bag, characterised in that the holding

device comprises two moulded plastic parts (21,
41, 141, 241, 341) facing each other, which are

elastic or elastically-sprung, for lateral
clamping fast of the pair of spectacles (25, 125)

by their frame (31, 131).
A fastener according to claim 1, characterised in
that the two moulded plastic parts (21, 41, 141,

241, 341) are shaped symmetrically.
A fastener according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the clip (5, 105) is formed

by a wire (3) made from spring steel or from an
elastic material; whereby in the area of the

plastic moulded parts (21), the wire (3) comprises
two sides (11, 15) essentially aligned parallel to

each other, and the plastic moulded parts (21) are
made of a material covering the two sections (11

and 15) of the wire (3).
A fastener according to claim 3, characterised in
that the sheetlike material comprises a hose or a 

spout (23) made of a woven, knitted or sprayed
sheetlike structure and that the hose (23) is

placed upon the front legs (11) and the tensioning
legs (15) forming the moulded plastic parts (21).
A fastener according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the clip (205) consists of

an essentially u-shaped body of plastic, on whose
downward reaching legs, there are extremities

(212) pointing inward at right angles, with an
elastically-sprung fastening part (208) being

attached to their upper base part (216).
A fastener according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the clip (305) consists of a

cruciform structure made of plastic, with its
horizontal beam (309) forming the two extremities

(312) carrying the two moulded plastic parts
(341), and its vertical beam (307) at its upper

extremity carrying the fastening part (308).
A fastener according to claim 6, characterised in
that hinged to the vertical beam (307) is a

rocking part (311) pointing towards the fastening
part (308); the said rocking part (311) being

hinged to a stay (313).
A fastener according to claim 7, characterised in
that at the extremities of the rocking part (311)

there are small feet for abutting to the fastening
part (308).
A fastener according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that attached to at least one of

the moulded plastic parts (21, 41, 141) is a 
tubular, annular or strap-like means (35) for

holding a writing implement (37).
A fastener according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the spacing (a) of the

moulded plastic parts (21, 41, 141) can be set by
an intermediate part (39) of a length (l) which

intermediate part (39) can be placed upon, or
threaded onto, the clip (5); or in that the

distance (a) can be set and adjusted by moving the
moulded parts (141) at angled extremities (112) on

the front legs (111).
