<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of α-glycol-containing glycidyl 
ether resins comprising the reaction of a polydric phenol with 

epichlorohydrin (ECH) in the presence of an aqueous alkali metal 
hydroxide, wherein, when substantially all the phenolic hydroxyls 

have reacted and moreover the reaction medium is free from ECH and 
alkali metal hydroxide, a monofunctional carboxylic acid is added 

and reacted with at least part of the in, situ formed glycidyl 
ether groups at a temperature in the range of from 80 to 180 °C, 

which is followed by adding a suitable solvent to the reaction 
mixture and heating the thus obtained system with an amount of an 

aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution which is at least 
sufficient to react with any residual chlorohydrin and unreacted 

carboxylic acid as well as to convert the glycidyl ester groups to 
the corresponding α-glycol groups, and finally isolating the thus 

obtained α-glycol-containing glycidyl ether resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of α-glycol-containing glycidyl ether resins, and more in particular 
to a process for the preparation of glycidyl ethers of 
polyhydric phenols having an α-glycol content which is higher than 
generally obtainable with the conventional processes for the 
preparation of said glycidyl ether resins; to the glycidyl ether 
resins thus prepared, and to their use. The conventional process 
for the preparation of glycidyl ether resins of polyhydric phenols, 
hereinafter referred to as epoxy resins, is the reaction of a 
polyhydric phenol and an excess of an epihalohydrin, especially 
epichlorohydrin, hereinafter referred to as ECH, in the presence of 
an etherification or condensation catalyst and an alkali metal 
hydroxide. Depending on the molar ratio of phenolic hydroxyl and 
ECH the resins may vary from a highly viscous liquid to a brittle 
solid; the liquid resins are obtained when using a high 
ECH/phenolic hydroxyl ratio and the solid resins are obtained when 
using a considerably lower ECH/phenolic hydroxyl ratio. Although each end group of the epoxy resins thus prepared 
should be in theory an epoxy group, in practice phenolic hydroxyl-, 
chlorohydrin- and α-glycol end groups are present too. By means of the above-mentioned conventional process solid 
epoxy resins, can be prepared containing α-glycol end groups not 
only in a larger proportion but also in a higher concentration. 
These are the so-called solvent finished solid α-glycol containing 
epoxy resins hereinafter referred to as conventional solid epoxy 
resins. Such conventional solid epoxy resins are particularly useful 
in coatings, especially in can-coatings, since α-glycol groups can 
have a positive effect on a number of coating performance 
properties in particular improved the reaction with cocuring  
 
resins. The disadvantages associated with the above conventional 
process are that ECH is used, it involves a complicated isolation 
step and it produces a substantial effluent stream. US 4,324,822 discloses a process for the preparation of epoxy 
resins having an α-glycol content of from 0.05 to 0.6 eq/kg by 
hydrolysing a terminal epoxy group containing starting resin, in 
the presence of water and a mineral acid or alkali, at a 
temperature in the range of from 50 to 150° and for a period of 
from 10 minutes to 20 hours. However as in the conventional process referred to above, this 
process requires a cumbersome product isolation step as a result 
whereof it is

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of α-glycol-containing glycidyl 
ether resins comprising the reaction of a polyhydric phenol with 

epichlorohydrin (ECH) in the presence of an aqueous alkali metal 
hydroxide, wherein, when substantially all the phenolic hydroxyls 

have reacted and moreover the reaction medium is substantially free 
from ECH and alkali metal hydroxide, a monocarboxylic 

acid is added and reacted with at least part of the in situ formed 
glycidyl ether groups at a temperature in the range of from 80 to 

180 °C, which is followed by adding a suitable solvent to the 
reaction mixture and heating the thus obtained system with an 

amount of an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution which is at 
least sufficient to react with any residual chlorohydrin ether 

groups and unreacted carboxylic acid as well as to convert the 
glycidyl ester groups to the corresponding α-glycol groups, and 

finally isolating the thus obtained α-glycol-containing glycidyl 
ether resin. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein ECH is employed in a 
range of from 1.25-5 moles per equivalent of phenolic hydroxyl. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 or 2, wherein the ratio of 
moles of alkali metal hydroxide to equivalents of phenolic hydroxyl 

is in the range of from 0.75-0.9:1. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
monocarboxylic acid is an aliphatic mono-carboxylic 

acid, and preferably formic acid. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the monocarboxylic 
acid carries a polar substituents attached to 

the α-C atom of the acid, which substituent is selected from the 
group consisting of hydroxyl groups, ether groups and halogen 

atoms. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1-5, wherein the 
carboxylic acid is employed in a molar excess with respect to the  

 
required increase of the α-glycol content, and the added carboxylic 

acid is only partially converted to the corresponding glycidyl 
ester group.
