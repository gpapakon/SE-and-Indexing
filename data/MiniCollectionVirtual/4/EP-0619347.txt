<ABSTRACT>
Coating compositions, especially for the coating of concrete or steel areas, which are based on monomers and/or oligomers of esters of (meth)acrylic acid with C1 to C8 alcohols, with the addition of fillers, pigments and/or additives, characterised in that they additionally contain hollow micro bodies, at least in a quantity which is sufficient to form a layer on the surface of a coating formed from the coating composition. The coating compositions according to the invention lead to coatings which can be polymerised rapidly and completely and which have a uniform appearance and a tack-free surface.

Coating compositions based on monomers and/or 
oligomers of esters of (meth)acrylic acid with C
1
 to C
8
 
alcohols, with addition of fillers, pigments and/or 

additives, characterised in that they additionally 
contain micro hollow bodies of an average particle size 

of 10 to 200 micrometres in at least a quantity which is 
adequate to form a layer having a minimum thickness of 

150 micrometres on the surface of a coating formed from 
the coating composition. 
Coating compositions according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the micro hollow bodies are 

selected from glass hollow spheres, plastic micro hollow 
spheres, filled plastic hollow bodies, borosilicate 

hollow bodies, aluminium silicate hollow bodies, glass 
hollow spheres with filled plastic hollow spheres and 

mixtures thereof. 
Coating compositions according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the micro hollow bodies are present 

in a quantity of 0.05 to 10.0 wt.%, based on the total 
formulation. 
Coating compositions according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the micro hollow bodies are present 

in a quantity of 0.3 to 2.0 wt.%, based on the total 
formulation. 
Coating compositions according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that they contain 10-50 

wt.% of (meth)acrylate monomers or oligomers, 90-50 
wt.% of fillers, pigments and other additives, as well as 

0.05 to 10 wt.% of micro hollow bodies.  
 
Coating compositions according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the micro hollow bodies are 

selected from borosilicate and aluminium silicate hollow 
spheres. 
Process for coating a concrete, ceramic, plaster, 
asphalt, bitumen or steel surface, characterised in that 

a conventional primer is applied and cured on this 
surface (a) and then (b) a coating composition according 

to one or more of the preceding claims is applied 
together with a suitable free-radical former and allowed 

to cure. 
Use of micro hollow bodies for producing a completely 
curable coating composition based on monomers and/or 

oligomers of esters of (meth)acrylic acid with C
1
 to C
8
 
alcohols. 
Use of micro hollow bodies to improve the 
polymerisability of a coating composition based on 

monomers and/or oligomers of esters of (meth)acrylic acid 
with C
1
 to C
8
 alcohols. 
Use of micro hollow bodies to increase the slip 
resistance of a coating made from a coating composition 

based on monomers and/or oligomers of esters of 
(meth)acrylic acid with C
1
 to C
8
 alcohols.
