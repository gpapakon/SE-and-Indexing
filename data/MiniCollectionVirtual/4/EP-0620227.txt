<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new heterocyclic iminobismethylenebisphosphonic acid 
derivatives. The compounds can be used as a bone resorption inhibitor, a dental 
calculus formation inhibitory agent and a polyvalent metal ion complex salt 
forming agent. Although various compounds have so far been synthesized as 
iminobismethylenebisphosphonic acid derivatives, those having a hetero ring as 
disclosed in the present invention has not been known. The present invention describes novel heterocyclic iminobismethylenebisphosphonic 
acid derivatives which are useful as a bone resorption inhibitor, a 
dental calculus formation inhibitory agent and a polyvalent metal ion complex 
salt forming agent. The heterocyclic iminobismethylenebisphosphonic acid derivatives of this 
invention are the heterocyclic iminobismethylenebisphosphonic acid derivative of 
the general formula (I) 
wherein
 
n is an integer of 0-5, and the group of the formula 
represents a 4-7 membered monocyclic or 7-11 membered condensed 
heterocyclic group containing 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms which may be substituted 
by a halogen atom(s) or a lower alkyl group(s)), 
and esters or salts thereof. The lower alkyl group as a substituent for the heterocyclic group is a straight or 
branched alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms, for preferable example, a methyl 
group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, a butyl group, an 
isobutyl group and a t-butyl group. For preferable example of the halogen atom 
as a substituent, there may be fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are the heterocyclic 
iminobismethylenebisphosphonic acid derivatives of the general formula (I) 
wherein the group of the formula 
is represented by the formula 
wherein
 
Z, Y and X are individually a carbon atom or a nitrogen atom, and -------- is a 
double bond or a single bond, and
 
wherein the group of the formula 
is represented by a pyridyl group, a pyrazyl group, an imidazolyl group, a 
pyrrolyl group, a pyrazolyl group or a pyrimidyl group. Moreover, the preferable bisphosphonic acid derivatives are those compounds 
represented by the following formulae  This invention further concerns a bone resorption inhibitor containing as an 
active ingredient the said heterocyclic iminobismethylenebisphosphonic acid 
derivative or an ester or salt thereof. As the esters of the said bisphosphonic acid derivatives, there may be 
mentioned lower alkyl esters such as a methyl ester, an ethyl ester, a propyl 
ester or a butyl ester. As the
