<DESCRIPTION>
 CYCLIC ALKYLIDENE SUBSTITUTED PYRIDINE HERBICIDESThis invention relates to a new class of substituted pyridinecarboxylic acid derivatives having a wide range of activity as herbicides.Pyridine derivatives have, for many years, been investigated for use in biological sciences. For example, 2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4-pyridinols have been found useful as herbicides and fungicides as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,748,334. Such compounds are characterized by substitution in the 4-position by a hydroxy radical. In addition to the hydroxy radical, the pyridine nucleus may also be substituted with broirto. chloro or iodo radicals. Trifluoromethyl pyridine derivatives have also been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,516,402 and 3,705,170 wherein the nucleus is further substituted by halogens as well as numerous other substituents. Some of these compounds are also noted to be useful as herbicides. Also known because of their fungicidal activity are 4-substituted 2,6-dichloro-3,5-dicyanopyridines wherein the 4-position is substituted with alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl or pyridyl groups. Such compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,284,293, while similar compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,629,270 wherein the 4-position is substituted with a heterocyclic group wherein the hetero atom is oxygen or sulfur.In EPO patent 44,262 there are disclosed 2,6- dialkyl-3-phenylcarbamyl-5-pyridinecarboxylates and 5- cyano-compounds useful as herbicides. There is no disclosure of the 2-haloalkyl radicals or any substitution in the 4-position of the pyridine ring. The pyridine derivatives have also received attention in the search for new herbicides and have been reported in U.S. Patents 1,944,412, 3,637,716, and 3,651,070. All of these patents disclose polyhalo derivatives of dicarboxypyridines. All have in common 

 the direct substitution on a ring carbon by a halogen in the 3- and 5-positions while the 2- and 6-positions are occupied by carboxylate groups. The 4-position is open to substitution by a wide range of materials including halogens, hydroxy radicals, alkoxy, and carboxyl groups. Such compounds have found utilization as herbicides, bactericides , and fungicides. When the 4-position is . occupied by a silver salt, U.S. Patent No. 1,944,412 discloses that such compounds have been utilized in the production of X-ray pictures with intravenous injection of such compounds.Pyridinedicarboxylate compounds useful as herbicides are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,692,184. These compounds have fluorinated methyl groups at the
