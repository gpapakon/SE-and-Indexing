<ABSTRACT>
A microporous filter assembly is disclosed which, in some modes of operation, has feed pressure fed to the external walls of the microporous fibres (13) comprising the filter. In other forms feed is caused to move across the walls of the fibres (13) by the application of a lowered pressure to the lumens of the fibres (13). Various forms of backwashing of the fibres (13) are disclosed, with none of the modes requiring a prepressurisation step of the environment within and around the fibres (13) prior to commencement of backwash. In particular forms of backwash, initial steps of the backwash include terminating supply of feed to the exterior surface of the fibres (13) and substantially removing remaining filtrate from the lumens of the fibres (13). In some embodiments the filter comprises a filter cartridge (10) including a bundle of fibres (13) housed within a closed, pressurisable shell (12). In other embodiments the filter comprises one or more bundles of fibres (102) suspended within an open vessel (101). The invention reduces the number of required pressurisation cycles of the environment within and around the fibres (13). In some forms such pressurisation is eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to concentration of
solids in a suspension using a hollow fibre membrane and, in
particular forms, to methods and apparatus for periodically
cleaning by backwashing the hollow fibre membranes.Prior art methods of concentrating solids in a liquid
suspension are described WO-A-85/01449 and in Australian patent specifications
576,424 and 582,968.
In that prior art, concentration is effected by a filter
element that comprises a bundle of hollow, porous, polymeric
fibres in a closed cartridge or shell. Polyurethane potting
compound is used to hold the respective ends of the fibres in
place within the cartridge without blocking the fibre lumens
and to close off each end of the cartridge.The transmembrane pressure differential necessary to
effect concentration of the solids in the prior art is
achieved by pressurising the feedstock which necessitates the
use of pumps, other ancillary equipment and, of course, a
closed filter cartridge.Backwashing of such prior art concentrators involves
increasing the pressure on both sides of the hollow fibres
within the closed shell to a relatively high value before
suddenly releasing that pressure on the shell side of the 
fibre walls to effect a sudden pressure differential across
the walls which causes a backwash action.It is an object of this invention to provide an
improved method of using a reverse-flow mode to dislodge
solids retained by filter elements to ensure rapid removal of
those retained solids and in which the separation and
dislodgement modes may be repeated for prolonged periods of
time.It is a further object of the present invention, in at
least some embodiments, to provide a method of backwashing a
hollow fibre filter which retains some of the features of the
prior art, notably the use of a prior lower pressure gas to
purge the lumens of liquid before using higher pressure gas
to backwash the membrane but without the need to close the
vessel before suddenly releasing the enclosed higher
pressure. This improvement allows a simpler system, less
subjected to repeated hydraulic shocks, and, in some
embodiments, use of an open vessel with lowered pressure
induced filtration. According to one aspect of the invention there is
provided a method of concentrating the solids of a liquid
suspension within a vessel comprising:
(i) applying the liquid suspension within a vessel
to the outer surface of elastic, microporous, hollow fibres
or tubular filter elements whilst applying pressure
to the liquid suspension so as to effect pressure
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of concentrating the solids of a liquid
suspension within a vessel comprising:


(i) applying the liquid suspension within a vessel (101)
to the outer surface of elastic, microporous, hollow fibres

or tubular filter elements (102) whilst applying pressure
to the liquid suspension so as to effect pressure filtration

or whilst applying a vacuum to the hollow fibre lumens
so as to effect negative pressure induced filtration,

thereby to induce and sustain filtration through the
membrane walls wherein;


(a) some of the liquid suspension passes through the
walls of the fibres (102) to be drawn off as

clarified liquid or filtrate from the hollow
fibre lumens, and
(b) at least some of the solids are retained on or
in the hollow fibres or otherwise as suspended

solids within the liquid of the vessel (101)
enclosing the tubular filter elements,
(ii) dislodging the retained solids from the fibres by
applying a dislodging medium through the lumens after

opening the vessel (101) to atmospheric pressure, wherein
the application of the dislodging medium is initially

conducted so as to displace liquid within the hollow fibre
lumens (102) through the hollow fibre membrane with gas at

a pressure below the bubble point of the pores of the fibres
followed by subsequent admission to the hollow fibre lumens

of gas at a pressure substantially higher than the bubble
point of the pores which drives liquid retained in the

membrane pores outwards allowing gas in the lumens to follow 
the liquid through the fibre walls to provide effective

cleaning and scouring even at the most distant point from
the lumen inlet (105) thus reducing the natural tendency in

a liquid only reverse flow backwash towards preferential
washing of pores near the lumen inlet (105).
The method of claim 1 wherein said method is carried
out as a continuous process utilising a repetitive cycle of

solid accumulation and solid discharge.
A concentrator for recovering fine solids from a
liquid feed suspension comprising:


(i) a vessel (101) which can be exposed to atmospheric
pressure and to which the liquid feed suspension can be

supplied either under pressure or at atmospheric pressure;
(ii) a plurality of elastic, hollow, microporous, polymer
fibres within the vessel, such fibres being assembled into

at least one bundle (102);
(iii) means (109) for applying a vacuum to the lumens of the
hollow fibres (102), or pressure to the vessel (101);
(iv) means (110) for withdrawing clarified liquid from the
fibre lumens; and
(v) means (113, 115) for applying gas pressure at two
pressures in sequence to the liquid in the fibre lumens and

walls while the vessel (101) is exposed to atmospheric
pressure to effect firstly a discharge of liquid in the

lumens through the fibre walls, and secondly a transmembrane
cleaning of the fibres, the higher (second) pressure applied

by the gas onto the liquid being sufficient to stretch
substantially all of the pores of the fibres, and the higher

pressure of the gas also being sufficient to ensure that the
gas will displace liquid and follow it through the larger

pores of the fibres to dislodge any solids retained therein; 
and for the emerging gas to scour the
 external walls of the
fibres and displace the removed solids into the bulk liquid

in the vessel.
The concentrator of claim 3 including means for
temporarily transferring the liquid contents of the vessel

(101) to a separate holding vessel (124) during backwash
operations.
The concentrator of claim 3 including means (130) for
raising the plurality of elastic, hollow, microporous

polymer fibres (102) above the liquid within the vessel
(101) during backwash operations.
