<DESCRIPTION>
Vaccination has played a key role in the control of viral
diseases during the past 30 years. Vaccination is based on a
simple principle of immunity: once exposed to an infectious
agent, an animal mounts an immune defense that provides lifelong
protection against disease caused by the same agent. The goal
of vaccination is to induce the animal to mount the defense
prior to infection. Conventionally, this has been accomplished
through the use of live attenuated or whole inactivated forms of
the virus as immunogens. The success of these approaches
depends on the presentation of native antigen which elicits the
complete range of immune responses obtained in natural
infection.Despite their considerable success, conventional vaccine
methodologies are subject to a number of potential limitations.
Insufficiently inactivated vaccines may cause the disease they
are designed to prevent. Attenuated strains can mutate to
become more virulent or non-immunogenic. Viruses that can
establish latency, such as the herpesviruses, are of particular
concern as it is not known whether there are any long-term
negative consequences of latent infection by attenuated
strains. Finally, there are no efficient means of growing many
types of viruses.Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology offer the
potential for developing vaccines based on the use of defined
antigens as immunogens, rather than the intact infectious
agent. These include peptide vaccines, consisting of chemically
synthesized, immunoreactive epitopes; subunit vaccines, produced
by expression of viral proteins in recombinant heterologous
cells; and the use of live viral vectors for the presentation of
one or more defined antigens.Both peptide and subunit vaccines are subject to a number of
potential limitations. A major problem is the difficulty of
ensuring that the conformation of the engineered proteins mimics 
that of the antigens in their natural environment. Suitable
adjuvants and, in the case of peptides, carrier proteins, must
be used to boost the immune response. In addition these
vaccines elicit primarily humoral responses, and thus may fail
to evoke effective immunity. Subunit vaccines are often
ineffective for diseases in which whole inactivated virus can be
demonstrated to provide protection. For example, canine
parvovirus subunits fail to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies
in rabbits (Smith and Halling, Gene, 29:263-269 (1984)),
although protective inactivated vaccines are available.As an alternative to recombinant-produced subunit vaccines
