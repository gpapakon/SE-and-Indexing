<ABSTRACT>
Process for destroying organic halogen compounds, which are contained in dust-containing gases which have a carbon content of less than 0.6% by weight, by oxidative degradation with the aid of fixed catalysts suitable for this purpose, characterised in that   a) the dust is separated off at 250 to 500 DEG C from the gases and the dust-free gas together with oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas is passed over the catalyst, or b) the dust is separated off below 250 DEG C, the organic halogen compounds are desorbed from the dust in an oxygen-containing gas stream at 250 to 500 DEG C and the gas stream is passed over the catalyst, or c) the dust-containing gas is passed over the catalyst in the presence of oxygen at 250 to 500 DEG C and the dust is then separated off.

<CLAIMS>
A process for decomposing organohalogen compounds which are
present in dust-laden gases, with a reduction in the

formation of dioxins, by oxidative breakdown with the aid of
solid catalysts suitable for this purpose, where the dust-laden

gases are treated by one of the following variants

a) previous deposition of the dust from the gases at
250-500째C, and the dust-free gas being passed together

with oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas over the catalyst,
b) previous deposition of the dust at below 250째C, the organohalogen
compounds being desorbed from the dust in an

oxygen-containing gas stream at 250-500째C, and the gas
stream being passed over the catalyst, or
c) the dust-laden gas being passed in the presence of oxygen
over the catalyst at 250-500째C, and the dust being subsequently

removed wherein the dust-laden gases have a
carbon content of less than 0.6% by weight.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the carbon content
is adjusted to not more than 0.4% by weight.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the carbon content
is adjusted with the aid of an afterburner downstream of

a drum-type furnace.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein there
is decomposition of aromatic chlorine compounds.
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein there is decomposition
of polychlorodibenzodioxins and/or polychlorodibenzofurans.
