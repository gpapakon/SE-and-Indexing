<ABSTRACT>
A normally white liquid crystal display includes polarizer and analyzer layers 
having perpendicular absorbing axes. A liquid crystal layer is disposed between the 

polarizer layer and the analyzer layer, with its director exhibiting an azimuthal twist through 
the layer. First and second electrodes are proximate to first and second major surfaces of 

the liquid crystal layer. A first negatively birefringent compensator layer, oriented with its 
optical axis substantially parallel to the average direction of the optical axis within a central, 

nominally homeotropic region of the liquid crystal layer in its driven state, is disposed 
between the polarizer layer and the liquid crystal layer. A second negatively birefringent 

compensator layer, with a birefringence substantially the same as the birefringence of the 
first compensator layer and oriented with its optical axis substantially parallel to the optical 

axis of the first compensator layer, is disposed between the analyzer layer and the liquid 
crystal layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with the design of liquid crystal displays and
particularly with techniques for maximizing the field of view of such displays by
maintaining a high contrast ratio at wide viewing angles.Liquid crystals are useful for electronic displays because polarized light traveling
through a thin film of liquid crystal is affected by the birefringence of the film and the
birefringence can be controlled by the application of a voltage across the film. Liquid
crystal displays became desirable because the transmission or reflection of light from an
external source, including ambient light, could be controlled using a liquid crystal device
with much less power than was required for the luminescent materials used in other
displays. As a result, liquid crystal displays are now commonly used in such applications
as digital watches, calculators, portable computers, and many other types of electronic
equipment, exhibiting in these applications the advantages of very long life and operation
with very low weight and low power consumption.The information in many liquid crystal displays is presented in the form of a row of
numerals or characters, which are generated by a number of segmented electrodes arranged
in a pattern. The segments are connected by individual leads to driving electronics, which
applies a voltage to the appropriate combination of segments to display the desired
information by controlling the light transmitted through the segments. Graphic information
or television displays may be achieved by a matrix of pixels which are connected by an X-Y
sequential addressing scheme between two sets of perpendicular conductors. More
advanced addressing schemes use arrays of thin film transistors to control the drive voltage
at the individual pixels. The latter scheme is applied predominantly to twisted nematic
liquid crystal displays.Contrast is one of the most important attributes determining the quality of a liquid
crystal display. The primary factor limiting the contrast achievable in a liquid crystal
display is the amount of light which leaks through the display in the dark state. This 
problem is exacerbated in a high ambient light environment, such as direct sunlight, where
there is a considerable amount of reflected and scattered ambient light. In addition, the
contrast ratio of the liquid crystal device also depends on the viewing angle. Contrast ratio
in a typical liquid crystal display is a maximum only within a narrow viewing angle
centered about normal incidence and drops off as the
