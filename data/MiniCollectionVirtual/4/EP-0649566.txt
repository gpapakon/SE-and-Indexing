<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce storage capacitors for DRAM cells, position holders (81) are made from SiO2 using auxiliary layers of SiO2 and polysilicon which are arranged in accordance with the negative pattern of the storage node arrangement (91). The storage nodes (91) are formed by the full-surface deposition and structuring of a doped polysilicon layer in such a way that they cover the surface inside the position holders (81) and their side walls and the surface of the position holders (81) is revealed in its upper region. After the position holders (81) have been removed, a storage dielectric and a cell plate are formed. The process is applicable to the production of stacked capacitor DRAM cells.
