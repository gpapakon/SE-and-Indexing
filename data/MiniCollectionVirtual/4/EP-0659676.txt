<ABSTRACT>
A one piece combplate (16) for a people moving 
device is provided having a body (22), a rear support 

(24), and a comb attachment surface (26). The body, 
rear support, and comb attachment surface define a 

lengthwise cross-sectional profile which extends 
uniformly in a widthwise direction across the combplate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to people moving devices in
general, and to combplates for people moving devises in
particular.Escalators, moving walkways, and other people
moving devices efficiently move a large volume of
pedestrian traffic from one point to another. At each
end of the device, landing areas provide access to
moving steps (or belts, or pallets) traveling at a
constant rate of speed. The landing areas typically
include a floorplate and a combplate. The floorplate
covers a structural frame which, in the landing, houses
mechanical equipment for actuating the moving steps. The
combplate is an intermediary surface between the
stationary floorplate and the moving steps.Historically, combplates and floorplates have
included a steel body covered by a liner made of a wear
and corrosion resistant material. The liner was
typically attached to the floorplate or combplate by
conventional fasteners such as rivets, which were often
exposed. The liner was usually contoured to make the
surface as slip resistant as possible.A problem with the aforementioned floorplate and
combplate arrangement is that the liners often vibrate
loose or free from the underlying floorplate or
combplate. Several disadvantages arise from loose or
free liners. First, a liner vibrating against an
underlying floorplate or combplate creates undesirable
noise. A person of skill in the art will recognize that
the "quietness" of a people moving device is perceived
as an indicia of quality. Another disadvantage of a
loose or free liner is that it presents a potential
safety hazard for passengers entering and exiting the
machine. Still another disadvantage of a loose or free 
liner is that the conventional fasteners may become free
from the floorplate or combplate. Free fasteners may
create undesirable noise within the device, as well as
cause damage to the machinery inside of the landing of
the device.The weight of steel floorplates and combplates is
another disadvantage of the prior art. Maneuvering
heavy steel floorplates and combplates is almost always
difficult and sometimes necessitates the use of a hoist.US-A-5255771 discloses a one piece combplate for a
people moving device, comprising a body having a width,
a length, a top surface, a bottom surface and a comb
attachment surface.The present invention is characterised by a
plurality of grooves extending widthwise across said top
surface, a plurality of ribs extending between said
bottom and top surfaces, and a rear support extending
out from said body on a surface opposite said grooved

<CLAIMS>
A one piece combplate (16) for a people moving
device, comprising a body (22) having a width, a length,

a top surface (28), a bottom surface (38) and a comb
attachment surface (26); characterised by a plurality of

grooves (30) extending widthwise across said top
surface, a plurality of ribs (40) extending between said

bottom and top surfaces, and a rear support (24)
extending out from said body on a surface opposite said

grooved top surface, and wherein said body, said rear
support, and said comb attachment surface define a

lengthwise cross-sectional profile which extends
uniformly in a widthwise direction.
A combplate according to claim 1, further
comprising means (36) for interlocking said combplate

with a floorplate (12) located adjacent said rear
support (24) of said combplate.
A combplate according to claim 2, wherein said
means for interlocking comprises a mating male and

female pair (35,36), one half (36) of said pair attached
to said rear support (24) and the other half (35) of

said pair attached to said floorplate (12); wherein
interlocking said combplate and said floorplate together

minimizes relative movement between said combplate and
floorplate.
A combplate according to claim 3, wherein said
mating male and female pair comprises a tongue groove

(36) and a tongue (35).
