<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatic tires according to this invention have a tread 
(1) provided with blocks (4a, 4b) separated by 

circumferential grooves (2) extending around the tread 
and lateral grooves (3) crossing the circumferential 

grooves, the blocks (4a, 4b) being respectively provided 
with two lateral sipes (5), characterized in that the 

lateral end portions (12b, 12c) having small rigidity in 
block portions (14) which are substantially separated by 

lateral sipes (5b, 5c) are reinforced by, for example, a 
platform (6). 
The invention has the effects of restraining block 
chipping in heavy duty tires and degrading of steering 

stability in passenger tires, and enhancing the 
performance on ice without degrading wet performance, by 

means of increasing sipe density and restraining 
lowering of the block rigidity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic tires, particularly
tires for ice-snow road surfaces, having a tread
provided with blocks separated by circumferential
grooves extending around the tread and lateral grooves
crossing the circumferential grooves and having plural
lateral sipes in the blocks.Recently various improvements have been made with
respect to treads to obtain studless tires having good
performance. It is effective for enhancing performance
on ice road surfaces to increase edge components by
forming a block pattern on the tread and arranging sipes
in the blocks.However, when plural both-end opening sipes extending in
the lateral direction and opening to two circumferential
grooves are formed in a block, for example, edge
components are increased, while the rigidity of the
whole block is decreased because the block is divided
into several parts by the both-end opening sipes. As a
result, sufficient performance on ice road surfaces
cannot be obtained. In particular, arranging a both-end
opening sipe adjacent to a lateral groove lowers the
rigidity of a block portion substantially separated by
this both-end opening sipe. Consequently, there is a
possibility that the block may chip easily in the case 
of heavy duty tires because its deformation during
driving and braking becomes large, and in case of
passenger tires steering stability may be degraded
because net contacting area is decreased by inclination
of the block and steering stability on a dry road
surface may also be degraded. Therefore it was
necessary to obtain means for enhancing the performance
on ice road surfaces to retain the block rigidity even
while increasing the density of sipes.It is useful as above mentioned means that a lateral
sipe adjacent to a lateral groove is made (a) to be a
one-end opening sipe opening to only one circumferential
groove and being closed in the block, or (b) to be a
both-end opening sipe with its depth at one end
shallower than that at the other end, similarly to a
pneumatic tire described in Japanese Patent Laid Open
No. 2-200503.However, according to an examination by the present
inventors with respect to the local rigidity of the
block, in the former case (a), the rigidity of a portion
where the one-end opening sipe adjacent to the lateral
groove opens to the circumferential groove is lower than
that of the other portion because the block is
substantially divided by the one-end opening sipe; and
in the latter case (b), the rigidity of a portion where
the sipe depth is deeper is lower than that of the
