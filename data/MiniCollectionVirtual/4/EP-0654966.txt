<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a handle for a 
fishing rod and a fishing rod including a handle. U.S. 4 850 130 (Childre) discloses a fishing rod 
having a handle that is at least partially surrounded by 
the third, fourth and fifth phalanges of a hand and the 
palm of that hand. A thumb portion extends forwardly of 
the portion that is at least partially surrounded. 
However, that thumb portion extends forwardly and 
outwardly. The handle comprises the features contained in the 
preamble of Claim 1. According to one aspect of the present invention a 
handle for a fishing rod that includes a gripping portion, 
the gripping portion, in use, being arranged to be at 
least partially surrounded by the third, fourth and fifth 
phalanges of a hand on the lower side of the gripping 
portion with a palm of that hand extending over the upper 
side, the third phalange being arranged to be more towards 
a forward part of the handle than the fifth phalange, the 
gripping portion being narrower in cross-section from one 
side to the other than it is from the upper to the lower 
side and in relation to the centre line passing from the 
rearward to the forward part of the gripping portion, the 
upper side of the gripping portion, in the rearward to the 
forward direction, extends at a lesser angle to the centre 
line at a rearward portion than it does at a forward 
portion and in that, in the rearward to forwards 
direction, the lower side of the gripping portion extends 
at a greater angle to the centre line at a rearward 
portion than it does at a forward portion, is 
characterised in that the handle includes a thumb portion 
arranged, in use, to be engaged by the thumb of a hand, 
the thumb portion extending forwardly from the gripping  
 
portion along the length of the handle with the thumb 
portion converging towards the centre line in the forwards 
direction. The distance between the upper and lower side of the 
gripping portion at an extent perpendicular to the centre 
line may be greater at the region where it is arranged to 
be at least partially surrounded by the third phalange 
than it is at the region where it is arranged to be at 
least partially surrounded by the fifth phalange. The dimensions of the gripping portion extending 
between the regions arranged to be bounded by the first 
and third knuckles of the third, fourth and fifth 
phalanges may increase in the rearward to the forward 
direction. The gripping portion may be curved in the region 
bounded by the first and third knuckles of the third,

<CLAIMS>
A handle for a fishing rod, the handle including a 
gripping portion, the gripping portion, in use, being 

arranged to be at least partially surrounded by the third, 
fourth and fifth phalanges of a hand on the lower side of 

the gripping portion with a palm of that hand extending 
over the upper side, the third phalange bei
ng arranged to 
be more towards a forward part of the handle than the 

fifth phalange, the gripping portion being narrower in 
cross-section from one side to the other than it is from 

the upper to the lower side, and in relation to the centre 
line passing from the rearward to the forward part of the 

gripping portion, the upper side of the gripping portion, 
in the rearward to the forward direction extends at a 

lesser angle to the centre line at a rearward portion than 
it does at a forward portion and in that, in the rearward 

to forwards direction, the lower side of the gripping 
portion extends at a greater angle to the centre line at 

a rearward portion than it does at a forward portion, 
characterised in that the handle includes a thumb portion 

arranged, in use, to be engaged by the thumb of a hand, 
the thumb portion extending forwardly from the gripping 

portion along the length of the handle with the thumb 
portion converging towards the centre line in the forwards 

direction. 
A handle as claimed in Claim 1 in which the distance 
between the upper and lower side of the gripping portion 

at an extent perpendicular to the centre line is greater 
at the region where it is arranged to be at least 

partially surrounded by the third phalange than it is at 
the region where it is arranged to be at least partially 

surrounded by the fifth phalange.  
 
A handle as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the dimensions of the gripping portion extending between 

the regions arranged to be bounded by the first and third 
knuckles of the third, fourth and fifth phalanges increase 

in the rearward to the forward direction. 
A handle as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the gripping portion is curved in the region bounded by 

the first and third knuckles of the third, fourth and 
fifth phalanges. 
A handle as claimed in Claim 4 in which the curve is 
concave. 
A handle as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the gripping portion includes an outwardly extending 

portion in the region of at least one end of the gripping 
portion. 
A handle as claimed in Claim 6 in which the outwardly 
extending or diverging portion is arranged to be contacted 

by the second phalange to resist relative movement of the 
handle to a hand gripping the handle in at least one 

direction through the grip. 
A handle as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
the handle is also arranged to be at least partially 

surrounded by a second phalange on the lower side thereof. 
An arrangement as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the handle includes a first index finger portion 

adjacent to the gripping portion which the second phalange 
and the palm of a hand are arranged to at least partially 

surround.  
 
A handle as claimed in any preceding claim including 
a second index finger portion extending to the forward 

part of the handle, away from the gripping portion on the 
side of the handle. 
A handle as claimed in any preceding claim in which 
a raised portion is included between the thumb portion and 

the gripping portion. 
A handle according to any preceding claim the handle 
being symmetrical about a mirror plane which extends along 

the centre line of the handle and bisects the upper and 
lower sides of the gripping portion. 
A fishing rod including a handle as claimed in any 
preceding claim. 
A fishing rod as claimed in Claim 13 in which the 
centre line of the handle is coincident with the elongate 

axis of the rod.
