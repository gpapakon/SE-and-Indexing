<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a die exchanging device for 
exchanging die sets (29) between a punch press (1) and a storage (31) unit 

comprising a transport unit (37) with a plurality of carrying 
sections (39) for carrying and transferring the die sets between the 

punch press and the storage unit and a loading device (67) for 
loading the transport unit with the die sets. The die 

exchanging device is particularly improved in that the loading 
device includes a die set charging unit for transferring 

singular die sets separately from the storage unit to carrying 
sections and vice versa, so that the punch press can be loaded 

with any desired combination of tools with an improved 
efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a die exchanging device for 
exchanging die sets between a punch press and a storage unit, 
comprising a plurality of carrying 
sections for horizontally carrying and transferring the die sets between the 
punch press and the storage unit and means for 
loading an unloading the die exchanging device with the die sets, 
the die exchanging device being moveable along an Y-axis. In the prior art, a finite number of die sets are 
attached in a turret of a turret punch press, and the die 
sets are exchanged by man power. Sometimes, an automatic 
die exchanging device is used to discharge die sets attached 
in the turret and to charge other die sets in the turret for 
next use. The above mentioned conventional automatic die 
exchanging device includes a pair of arms, that is, a first 
arm for discharging die sets from the turret and a second 
arm for taking other die sets out from a die storage 
magazine. By the way, in the above mentioned conventional 
automatic die exchanging device the pair of arms only carry 
out discharging and taking out of a die set respectively 
from the turret and the die storage magazine at the same 
time and only exchanges the die sets. Therefore, it is 
necessary to exchange die sets several times when some die 
sets are required for one processing on a workpiece, and 
this takes much time totally. In addition, it is necessary to move the arms upwards 
and downwards since heights of the die storage magazine and  
 
a die set attached in the punch press for use differ from 
each other. Due to such movements of the arms, which is 
complicated, the die exchanging device requires large space 
and much time for exchanging of the die sets. Furthermore, 
structure of the device becomes complicated for moving the 
arms, and, as a result, the exchanging device will cost much 
and take much time for possible repairing or maintaining. By the way, in a conventional turret punch press with a 
die exchanging device, for example, a method for positioning 
and fixing a die set in the turret is generally used by 
pushing the die set to come into contact with a reference 
surface disposed on the turret and fixing it by means of a 
hydraulic pressing device. In the above mentioned positioning and fixing method, 
the contact of the die set with the reference surface of the 
turret is surface-to-surface contact, and therefore it is 
difficult to cause the die set to come into contact with the 
reference surface uniformly by reason of processing 
precision. Then an
