<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel class of compounds 
which may be used as novel crosslinking compositions to 
prepare novel UV-curable hydrophilic copolymers suitable for 
use as articles in the biomedical field, especially contact 
lenses. In the field of crosslinked polymeric systems, 
initiators, and crosslinking compounds and compositions 
(crosslinkers) are often added to monomer mixes before 
polymerization. These crosslinkers facilitate formation of 
the desired polymer. In addition, crosslinkers can affect 
specific characteristics and mechanical properties of the 
resultant polymers.  
 Crosslinkers which are similar in structure to the 
monomers being reacted are often added to monomer 
mixtures. For example, a di(meth)acrylate or 
di(meth)acrylamide monomer would commonly be used as a 
crosslinker for a (meth)acrylate/(meth)acrylamide 
system. Alternatively, to react a vinyl-type system 
comprising N-vinyl pyrrolidone or vinyl acetate, for 
example, a vinyl-type crosslinker such as allyl 
methacrylate would ordinarily be used. When a specific copolymeric system is desired which 
includes both a methacrylate-containing monomer and a 
non-acrylic vinyl-containing monomer, polymerization 
problems occur as a result of the varying reactivity of 
the two monomer types. In other words, non-acrylic 
vinyl-containing monomers are generally not reactive 
with the (meth)acrylate-containing monomers. Therefore, to copolymerize N-vinyl pyrrolidone 
(NVP) with, for example, methyl methacrylate (MMA), 
allyl methacrylate has been used as a crosslinker with  
 
t-butylperoxyoctoate added as a thermal reaction 
initiator, and benzoin methyl ether (BME) as a photoinitiator. 
Such a monomer mix may then be first 
subjected to UV irradiation to polymerize the 
methacrylate groups, followed by heat curing to 
polymerize the allyl- and vinyl-containing monomers. 
This polymerization scheme is relatively cumbersome and 
may lead to polymeric systems having poor yields or a 
resulting polymer of poor optical quality. In addition, 
such resulting polymers may not be true crosslinked 
copolymers but may be mere nonhomogeneous 
interpenetrating polymer networks. Alternately, a crosslinker such as allyl 
methacrylate could be used to assist the polymerization 
of the NVP/methacrylate system; however, this would also 
require heat curing. Heat curing is not as desirable as 
UV curing since over-heating may adversely affect the 
desired properties of the end-product hydrogel. In 
addition, insufficient heat curing can
