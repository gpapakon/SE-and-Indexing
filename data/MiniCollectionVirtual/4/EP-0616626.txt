Luster pigments based on multiply coated
plateletlike silicatic substrates, obtainable by

further coating substrates already coated with a first
layer comprising a colorless or selectively absorbing

metal oxide

a) initially with a second, nonselectively absorbing
layer consisting essentially of carbon, metal

and/or metal oxide, and
b) if desired subsequently with a third layer
comprising colorless or selectively absorbing

metal oxide, the third layer being compulsory in
the case of a second layer consisting essentially

of carbon,

wherefor

the carbon layer (step a) is applied by thermal decomposition
of oxygen-containing hydrocarbons that for

every two carbon atoms contain at least one oxygen
atom,
the metal layer (step a) is applied by gas phase decomposition
of volatile compounds of these metals in an

inert gas, and
the metal oxide layer (step a and/or b) is applied by
gas phase decomposition of volatile compounds of these

metals in the presence of oxygen, water vapor or
mixtures thereof
to the substrates coated in case a) with a first metal
oxide layer and in case b) additionally with a 

nonselectively absorbing layer (a).
Luster pigments based on multiply coated
plateletlike silicatic substrates comprising


A) a first layer comprising colorless or selectively
absorbing metal oxide,
B1) a second, nonselectively absorbing layer
consisting essentially of metallic iron,

molybdenum and/or tungsten, or
B2) a second, nonselectively absorbing layer
consisting of carbon, and
C) if desired a third layer comprising colorless or
selectively absorbing metal oxide, the third layer

being compulsory in the case of a second layer
consisting of carbon,

which are characterized by the uniform and filmlike
structure of the layers.
Luster pigments as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the first layer comprises titanium oxide,

zirconium oxide, tin oxide and/or iron oxide.
Luster pigments as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the second, nonselectively absorbing layer

comprises carbon, iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium,
molybdenum, tungsten, magnetite, nickel oxide, cobalt

oxides and/or vanadium oxides.
Luster pigments as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the third layer comprises titanium oxide,

zirconium oxide, chromium oxide and/or iron oxide.
A process for preparing luster pigments based
on multiply coated plateletlike silicatic substrates by

the steps set forth in claim 1.
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
volatile metal compounds used in step a) are the

carbonyls and in step b) the carbonyls, halides,
oxychlorides or alkoxides.
The use of the luster pigments of claims 1 or
2 for coloring coatings, printing inks, plastics, 

decorative cosmetic preparations, glasses and ceramic
products.
