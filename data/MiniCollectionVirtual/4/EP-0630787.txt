<ABSTRACT>
A flow control valve having a housing (1) having a first 
port (2) and a second port (3) and a spool (4) mounted in the housing. 

A first fluid chamber (5) and a second fluid chamber (6) which 
impart a fluid pressure to both ends of the spool 

communicate with each other through a fluid passage (8) formed 
with an orifice (7). As the spool moves, thrust to the spool 

produced by a difference in pressure at both ends of the 
spool balances with a biasing force produced by the biasing 

means (10). The flow control valve is provided with an annular 
seal made of an elastic material (13) together with a seal 

member (12). When the edge of the land portion on the outer 
periphery of the spool is brought into contact with the 

annular seal, the first port is completely shut off from 
the second fluid chamber. Thus, leakage will become zero 

when the valve portion is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flow control valve used 
in a fluid pressure system, e.g. in a brake system for 
automobiles, in which a high-pressure, low-viscosity fluid 
has to be controlled precisely in a wide flow range. Fig. 5 shows a flow control valve proposed in 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 3-223578 by the 
present applicant. It comprises a housing 1 having a first 
port 2 and a second port 3, a spool 4 slidably mounted in 
the housing, a first fluid chamber 5 and a second fluid 
chamber 6 applying a fluid pressure on both ends of the 
spool from opposite directions, a fluid passage 8 having an 
orifice 7 through which the first and second fluid chambers 
5 and 6 communicate with each other, the second fluid 
chamber 6 further communicating with the second port 3, and 
a valve portion 9 controlling the fluid current between the 
first port 2 and the first fluid chamber 5 as the spool 4 
moves in an axial direction. With the automatic opening adjustment effect of the 
valve portion 9 in this flow control valve, a thrust to the 
spool produced by the difference in fluid pressure in the 
first and second fluid chambers 5 and 6 balances with the 
biasing force of biasing means 10. The flow determined by 
the difference in pressure and the sectional area of the  
 
orifice is introduced from the first port 2 through the 
orifice 7 to the second port 3. In the conventional flow control valve, when the 
valve portion is closed, since the path from the first port 
to the first fluid chamber is closed by the annular seal, 
the flow rate can be controlled precisely even in low-flow 
area. However, some amount of leakage is inevitable 
through the gap between the spool and the housing from the 
first port to the second fluid chamber. Although the 
leakage can be reduced by narrowing the gap, it is 
impossible to reduce it to zero. Therefore, the advantage 
of precise control by use of the annular seal is not 
sufficiently utilized. The application of the flow control 
valve is thus limited. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
flow control valve which obviates this problem. In order to solve this problem, according to the 
present invention, a seal member is provided to seal the 
outer periphery of the spool between the first port and the 
second fluid chamber. The seal member used in this invention should 
preferably be made mainly of polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE). When the valve portion is closed, the first port is 
shut off from the first and second fluid chambers by the
