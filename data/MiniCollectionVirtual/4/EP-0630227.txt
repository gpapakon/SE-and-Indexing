<ABSTRACT>
The toothpaste proposed contains as an abrasive, preferably as the sole abrasive, expanded perlite, generally with a particle size in the range 1 to 150  mu m, in particular with a main fraction in the region of 20  mu m. This gives enhanced cleaning power, and improved protection of the tooth enamel against wear and scratching.

<CLAIMS>
Toothpaste for daily dental care, having improved
cleaning power and being easy to the hard dental substance,

containing an aqueous liquid and an abrasive body, the
toothpaste containing less than 15 % by weight of precipitated

silicic acid or being free from precipitated silicic
acid, perlite being present as an abrasive body component

in an amount of from 1 to 12 % by weight of the toothpaste,
said perlite being in the form of sharp-edged particles

which disintegrate by mechanical stress under the conditions
of toothbrushing into smaller, also sharp-edged particles.
Toothpaste according to claim 1, characterised in that
said abrasive body is a perlite fraction.
Toothpaste according to claim 2, characterised in that
it contains the perlite fraction as the sole abrasive body.
Toothpaste according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that it further contains a secondary abrasive body.
Toothpaste according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that it further contains a finely divided

pyrogenic silicic acid which has been made hydrophilic, as
a binder and a viscosity regulator.
Toothpaste according to any one of claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that it contains as a perlite fraction

such a fraction which has a most frequent average particle
size of from 20 to 25 µm, particles having sizes below 1 µm 

and exceeding 150 µm being absent, and that the fraction
between 20 and 25 µm amounts to about 50 % by weight of the

total perlite fraction.
Toothpaste according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that it contains from 1 to 6 % by weight

of perlite.
Toothpaste according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that it contains from 1 to 3 % by weight

of perlite.
Toothpaste according to any one of claims 5 to 8,
characterised in that the weight ratio of perlite to pyrogenic

silicic acid is comprised between about 12:1 to 1:3.
Toothpaste according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it contains a tenside mixture

composed of extremely pure sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium
lauryl sarcosinate and a sodium taurid.
Toothpaste according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it has the following composition,

given by weight:

aqueous liquid of water, glycerol, sorbitol, etc.
55 to 85%
artificial sweetening agent
0.1 to 0.5%
organic thickening agent
0 to 3%
