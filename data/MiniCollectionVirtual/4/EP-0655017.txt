<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric
sensor and to a flow transducer incorporating such a
sensor.To avoid the need to transport and store water, it is
becoming common to dispense beverages, for example, by
mixing a concentrate with water at the point of sale.
However, the resultant beverages dispensed by the systems
which are currently available are generally variable in
quality. For example, if water and concentrate are
dispensed from individual pipes, but at more than one
location, the resultant pressure drops and viscosity
variations change the water to concentrate volumetric ratio
of the beverage being dispensed. In this respect,
currently available mechanical means for controlling the
flow of a liquid during a dispense cannot be made to react
to changes in the pressure drop, viscosity or flow rate of
the liquids.US-A-3,365,593 describes a piezoelectric sensor
comprising a housing defining an opening, a plastics
material body within said housing, a piezoelectric element
comprising a piezoelectric film supported to extend across
said opening, electrically conductive regions contacting
opposed surfaces of said piezoelectric film and overlying
to define one area of said piezoelectric film at which the
opposed conductive regions coincide, and means for making
electrical connections to said conductive regions, wherein
said means for making electrical connections comprises an
electrically conductive post extending through said
plastics material body, said post having an end surface
contacting a first, inner surface of said piezoelectric
film at said one area thereof. This sensor is for use in a
vibration detector or as a vibration generator.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved piezoelectric sensor which is suitable for use in 
a system for dispensing fluids.According to the present invention there is provided a
piezoelectric sensor as defined above, characterised in
that said end surface of said conductive post and a front
surface of said plastics material body together define a
combined support surface for said piezoelectric film, and
in that said means for making electrical connections to
said conductive regions further comprises a radially
extending flange defining the opening of said housing, an
inner surface of said flange contacting the periphery of
the second, outer surface of said piezoelectric film.When electrical signals, for example, electrical
pulses, are applied to said electrically conductive
regions, it is only at said one area of the piezoelectric
film
