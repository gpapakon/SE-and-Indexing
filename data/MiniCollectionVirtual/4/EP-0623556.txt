<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synthesis of octahedral 
molecular sieves, mainly manganese oxides, equivalent to 
the structures of the natural minerals, todorokite and 
hollandite. Hollandite (BaMn8O16) , cryptomelane (KMn8O16), manjiroite 
(NaMn8O16), and coronadite (PbMn8O16) are all naturally 
occurring manganese minerals with a 3-dimensional 
framework tunnel structure. The structure consists of MnO6 
octahedra which share edges to form double chains, and the 
octahedra of the double chains share corners with adjacent 
double chains to form a 2x2 tunnel structure. The size of 
these tunnels is 5.46 Å x 5.46 Å. Ba, K, Na and Pb ions 
are present in the tunnels and coordinated to the oxygens 
of the double chains. The identity of the tunnel cations 
determines the mineral species. The minerals are members 
of the hollandite-romanechite family. Zeolites and zeolite-like materials are well-known 
molecular sieves. These materials use tetrahedral 
coordinated species TO4, (T=Si, Al, P, B, Be, Ga, etc.,) as 
the basic structure unit. Through the secondary building 
units (SBU), a variety of frameworks with different pore 
structures are then built. Like tetrahedra, octahedra 
also can be used as the basic structural unit to form 
octahedral molecular sieves (OMS). Herein below, we will refer to the materials with a 2x2 
tunnel structure as hollandites, and identify each member 
by the identity of the tunnel ions. Such minerals can be 
characterized by the general formula:  
 
A2-yMn8O16xH2O 
where A is the counter ion (alkali or alkaline earth metal 
or Pb+2), Mn represents Mn+4 and Mn+2 and x is 6 to 10 with 
y varying from 0.8 to 1.3. Because of their tunnel structure, the materials may be 
useful as shape selective catalysts and molecular sieves. 
K-hollandite and Ba-hollandite have reportedly been 
synthesized (as discussed by Parida et al, "Chemical 
Composition, Microstructure and other Characteristics of 
Some Synthetic MnO2 of Various Crystalline Modifications", 
Electrochimica Acta , Vol. 26, pp. 435-43 (1981) and 
Strobel et al, "Thermal and Physical Properties of 
Hollandite-Type K1.3Mn8O16 and (K,H3O)xMn8O16", J. Solid State 
Chemistry, Vol. 55, PP. 67-73 (1984). However, these 
syntheses are unreliable and considerable difficulties 
have been experienced by practitioners in this field. Villa et al discussed the synthesis of oxide systems 
containing Mn in combination with other elements in "Co-Mn-Ti-K 
OXIDE SYSTEMS" Applied Catalysis, Vol. 26, pp. 
161-173 (1986). Torardi et al. discussed
