<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a charging member and a 
charging device which can be utilized in an image forming 
process such as an electrophotographing process or 
electrostatic recording process. In the charging process of an electrophotographing, a 
high voltage (DC 5 to 8 kV) is conventionally applied 
between a shielding plate and a metal wire partially 
surrounded by the plate to generate corona, by which a 
photosensitive member is charged. In this process, however, 
corona products such as ozone and NOx produced by the corona 
generation cause several problems such as deterioration of a 
photosensitive member surface, blurring or degradation of an 
image. Further, wire contamination caused by the products 
affects the quality of an image, resulting in white stripes 
or black stripes in an output image. From an electrical 
aspect also, the process is not effective, because most of 
loaded electrical current flows into the shielding plate 
surrounding the wire, and it is only 5 to 30% of the current  
 
that flows into the photosensitive member. In order to overcome these problems, direct charging 
devices in which a charging member is contacted with a 
member to he charged such as a photosensitive member has 
been proposed, as is shown in the Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publications JPA 57-178267 and JPA 56-104351. Several types 
of charging members are conventionally employed for directly 
charging. These are (a) a conductive rubber roller with a 
metal core having been coated with a rubber material such as 
butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber (NBR), acrylic rubber, or 
chloroprene rubber, whose resistivity is adjusted by 
dispersing low-resistivity particles such as carbon black, 
and (b) a roller coated with nylon or polyurethane as 
disclosed in the Japanese Examined Patent Publication JPB2 
50-13661. However, the conductive rubber roller (a) has 
disadvantages in that the hardness of the rubber is 
relatively high because a relatively large amount of the low 
resistivity particles is dispersed in the rubber in order to 
maintain its low resistivity, and that the surface of the 
member to be charged such as a photosensitive member can be 
damaged due to the low resistivity particles present in the 
surface of the rubber. Such damages likely lead to image 
defects such as stripes. Although the addition of oil or 
the like may lower the hardness of the roller, it brings  
 
about another problem that the oil exudes from the rubber 
roller surface and then contaminates the surface of the 
photosensitive
