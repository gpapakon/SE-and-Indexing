<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser including a substrate (SU), means for 
reducing the lateral current flow (CL1D1,CL1UD,CL1D2) and means forming 

the 
active elements (GU1,ACT,GU2), wherein said means for reducing the 

lateral 
current flow are composed by at least three layers of which 

the external ones (CL1D1,CL1D2) are entirely doped and the internal 
layers (CL1UD) 

are doped only in the zones lateral to the active element so 
that these layers reduce the side current flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser as set 
forth in the preamble of claim 1 and to a process for the 
production of semiconductor lasers as set forth in the 
preamble of claim 8. As known, the solid state laser structures emit luminous 
energy from zones having side dimension in the order of a few 
micrometers. In order to obtain low laser threshold currents, high optical 
power emitted and hence maximum electro-to-optical conversion 
yield, it is necessary to make the current flow in the very 
small active zone only. Various methods have been developed to confine the electric 
energy flow in the region of light emission, having as their 
object the maximization of the conversion yield. For instance US Pat. No. 5,151,914 discloses a device having 
a region blocking the current flow by means of a high 
resistivity layer obtained through implantation of transition 
(metallic) element ions. With this structure good results are 
obtained but the process is somewhat critical. In an article by G.A. Vawter et al entitled "Implanted Planar 
Buried Heterostructure, Graded-Index, Separate Confinement 
Heterostructure Laser in GaAs/AlGaAs", IEEE 1989 it was 
described a laser structure obtained with only one epitaxial  
 
growth and the doping of the layers forming the region which 
blocks the current flow is carried out through high energy 
ion implantation. This structure has the drawback due to a low accuracy in the 
relative positioning between the active element and the 
blocking structure. In the European patent application No. 0 176 028 it is described a laser diode able to 
reduce the lateral current flow, by means of a pn junction created with a diffusion of 
dopant from a layer, through an other layer, to a layer in which an inversion of the 
dopant is achieved. It is an object of the present invention, as defined in Claims 1 and 5, to provide a process 
for constructing a laser structure which is capable of 
effectively blocking the current flow in the zones lateral to 
the active element, using simple and accurate techniques. In accordance with the invention, therefore, the laser is 
structured as set forth in claim 1 and the process for 
obtaining this device is set forth in claim 8. A characteristic feature of this invention is the manner in 
which the layers forming means for reducing the lateral 
current flow are doped. Other characteristics of the invention are set forth in the 
subclaims. Another feature of this invention is the accurate control of 
dimensions, positioning and
