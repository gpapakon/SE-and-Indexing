<ABSTRACT>
The cryobiological container comprises a double-casing reservoir structure (1) including an inner casing (2) having a cylindrical side wall (4) and a bottom wall (5) and forming an internal volume accessible via an upper opening (6) of the same diameter of the cylindrical wall (4), the bottom wall (5) comprising a central bearing (7) intended to receive a pivot (8) integral with the bottom (9) by a rotating storage tank (10) capable of being received in the internal casing (4) and having a cylindrical side wall (11) of diameter slightly less than that of the side wall (4) of the inner casing (2) and provided, at its periphery, with a plurality of guide and centring rollers (15) cooperating with the side wall (4) of the inner casing (2). The access opening (6) can advantageously be closed by a plug carried by a cover structure mounted so as to pivot on the reservoir structure (1).

Cryobiological container comprising a reservoir 
structure with a double envelope (1) having a vertical axis 

comprising an inner envelope (2) having a lateral 
cylindrical wall (4) and a bottom wall (5) and forming an 

inner volume accessible through an upper opening (6) having 
the same diameter as that of the cylindrical wall (4) and a 

stopper (12) for closing the upper opening, characterized 
in that the bottom wall (5) comprises a central bearing (7) 

designed to cooperate with a pivot (8) firmly attached to a 
bottom (9) of a revolving cylindrical storage vessel (10) 

having a vertical access able to be received coaxially 
within the inner envelope (2) and having a lateral 

cylindrical wall (11) with a diameter slightly less than 
that of the lateral wall (4) of the inner envelope (2). 
Container according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the stopper (12) is carried by a covering structure (17) 

supported in a hinged manner at one of its ends to the 
reservoir structure (1). 
Container according to claim 2, characterized in that 
it comprises a board (21) for displaying the operating 

parameters of the container disposed on the covering 
structure (17). 
Container according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterized in that it comprises means (20) for assisting 

in lifting the covering structure (17). 
Container according to one of claims 2 to 4 
characterized in that it comprises a peripheral cowling 

(23) carried by the reservoir structure (1).  
 
Container according to claim 5, characterized in that 
it comprises at least one rod (25) for manoeuvring the 

covering structure (17) having an end connected in a hinged 
manner (26) to the covering structure and of which the 

other end cooperates with the cowling (23) to limit the 
opening angle of the covering structure. 
Container according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the lateral wall (11) of the 

revolving vessel (10) comprises, at its periphery, a 
plurality of rollers (15) having a vertical axle (14) 

cooperating with the lateral wall (4) of the inner envelope 
(2). 
Container according to one of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the revolving vessel (10) comprises, 

at its upper end, a plurality of components (16) for 
manually operating the vessel (10) in rotation within the 

inner envelope (2). 
Container according to claim 7 and claim 8, 
characterized in that the operating components (16) are 

mounted axially on the peripheral flange (13) connected to 
the upper end of the lateral wall (11) of the revolving 

vessel (10) and on which are mounted the axles (14) of the 
rollers (15). 
Container according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the revolving vessel (10) is made of 

stainless steel.
