<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to steel that is
adaptable and resistant to hot and wet environments, for
example, severe environments to which ballast tanks or sea-water
pipes are exposed, and to a method of manufacturing
the same.Tankers that will be manufactured in the future should
have a double hull structure of the type shown in Figs. 4A
and 4B to meet the regulations of the International
Maritime Organization (IMO). A double hull section of a
tanker 20 is used as a ballast tank 21 constructed to
protect oil tanks 22. The double hull structure has the
purpose of preventing oil spills.Since the surface area of the ballast tank 21 that is
exposed to sea water is considerably enlarged (two to three
times) as compared with a conventional single hull
structure, various problems arise in the painting process
and in corrosion protection generally.As for problems arising in the painting process, the
ballast tank 21 must be coated once or twice with coal-tar
epoxy resin paint. However, this is difficult and
dangerous for painters because the painting operation is
performed in a narrow and confined space. In addition, the
considerable area to be painted causes the coating work to
take a long time and to involve high cost. What is even
worse, even higher cost and more labor are required for
repairing the double hull structure after extended use, as
compared with new ship construction.The corrosion protection employs both paint such as
coal-tar epoxy resin paint and cathodic protection
measures. Since sea water flows into and out of the
ballast tank 21, the ballast tank 21 is exposed to a
severely corrosive environment. If sea water is present in 
the ballast tank 21, corrosion can substantially be
prevented, thanks to modern cathodic protection measures.
However, the uppermost portion of the ballast tank 21 and
the underside of the deck 23 that are not normally immersed
in sea water are subjected to a severely corrosive
environment, the temperature of which may be very high and
which is repeatedly splashed with sea water. If no water
is present in the ballast tank 21, the environment becomes
hot and wet and therefore the effect of cathodic protection
measures cannot be obtained, and the coal-tar epoxy resin
paint acts solely to prevent corrosion. The life of the
coal-tar epoxy resin paint applied to the ballast tank can
be expected to be about ten years, which is about half the
life of the ship. In the residual ten years corrosion must
be prevented by further painting, with major problems and
difficulties.Since
