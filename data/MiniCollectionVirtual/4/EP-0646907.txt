<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head can be made by:
 

   a first step of butting projection end faces of a pair 
of magnetic cores (11,12) each of which is previously machined into 

a convex shape, through a magnetic gap member (1);
 

   a second step of forming notches (14a,14b) which reach a 
winding groove (21), at said butted projection end faces of said 

magnetic cores by an electric discharge machining process, 
thereby regulating a track width (Tw); and

 
   a third step of filling under heat treatment glass (15,16) 

into grooves (17a,18a) at two sides of said pair of convex magnetic 
cores and said notches . When the magnetic head is used, a 

magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus which is suitable 
for high density recording such as a digital VTR is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic head as set forth in the preamble of claim 1 and
to a method of manufacturing a magnetic head as set forth in the preamble of claim 5. A
magnetic head and a method of this kind are known from US-A-4 425 701.The aforementioned document discloses a method in which by separate cutting or
dicing steps two comb-like structures are formed from ferromagnetic substance core
blocks, said dicing steps forming partial grooves which are separated from one other by a
tooth or projection. After having filled the partial grooves with glass, mirror-grinded the
blocks including the end faces of the projections and applied a gap spacer or film, the
blocks are abutted to one another in a manner that opposing end faces of the projections
of the opposing blocks match. After bonding the blocks to one another, the assembly thus
formed is cut into the individual heads. There is no other grinding or cutting process which
could influence the track width of the magnetic gap defined by the width of the projections.The accuracy of the track width of the magnetic gap is dependent of the accuracy with
which the blocks are aligned. A mis-alignment influences the accuracy of the track width of
all magnetic gaps. Further, the accuracy of the track width also depends of the accuracy of
the width of the grooves. If those are unequal, it is not possible to attain an overall
accuracy even if some of the track widths are accurately adjusted. All this is the result of
the fact that an adjustment of the track width of the heads is not separately made.In a system such as a digital VTR wherein a large amount of signals are recorded and
reproduced, it is essential to employ high density magnetic recording/reproduction
techniques such as the narrow-track technique and the short-wavelength technique.Generally, it is known that high density recording/reproduction can be attained when the
coercive force of a magnetic medium is increased and the saturation magnetic flux density
(hereinafter referred to as "Bs") of a magnetic head is increased. Ferrit material which has 
mainly been used in the prior art as a magnetic head
material has Bs of about 0.5 T. When a ferrite magnetic
head is used for a metal tape having a coercive force as
high as 80 kA/m or more, therefore, there occurs magnetic
saturation so that recording cannot be conducted
satisfactorily. To comply with this, researches have
vigorously been conducted on magnetic heads using a material
which has Bs larger than ferrite, such as a Sendust alloy
material
