<ABSTRACT>
The heat exchanger, which is intended, in particular, for controlling heat transfer on the condensate side, has a row of enclosing tubes (tubular jackets) (1) to which the secondary heating medium flows in parallel and in each of which there is located a heating tube (tubular heater) (2) through which steam or condensate flows in counterflow to the secondary heating medium. The enclosing tubes (1) open in a common secondary flow line (pipe) (3) with their tube ends (1') on the feed side. The heating tubes (2) are led with a smooth-walled section (6) through the opening (4) of the respective enclosing tube (1) into the secondary flow line (3) and outwards through the wall thereof to a common steam flow line (5).

A vapour-heated heat exchanger, in particular for regulation at
the condensate side of the heat transmission, comprising a housing which

has a vapour-heated heating system and through which a secondary heating
medium flows and which can be connected at the upstream end to a return

for the secondary heating medium and at the downstream end to a feed for
the secondary heating medium, and heating tubes (2) through which the

heating vapour flows parallel and in counter-flow relationship to the
secondary heating medium and which are connected at the upstream end (2")

to a vapour feed and at the downstream end (2') to a condensate return,
wherein the housing comprises a series of casing tubes (1) through which

the secondary heating medium flows in parallel relationship and in each
of which is arranged a respective one of the heating tubes (2) which at

the feed end are guided outwardly to the common vapour feed through a
secondary feed conduit (3) which is common to the casing tubes (1), for

the secondary heating medium, and the wall thereof, characterised in that
the casing tubes (1) open in the secondary feed conduit (3) with their

tube end (1') at the feed end, which is open at the end thereof, that the
heating tubes (2) are guided at the feed end into the secondary feed

conduit (3) through the mouth opening (4), which is formed at the end, of
the respective casing tube (1), and that the casing tubes (1) are reduced

in cross-section in the region of their mouth opening (4) into the
secondary feed conduit (3).
A heat exchanger according to claim 1 characterised in that the
heating tubes (2) have a heat exchange surface area which is as small as

possible and in particular are smooth-walled in the region of the mouth
opening (4) of the casing tube (1), into the secondary feed conduit (3)

and within the secondary feed conduit (3) itself.
A heat exchanger according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that the reduced mouth opening region of the casing tube (1) is formed by

a short axial connecting portion (7) into which the casing tube (1)
merges with an outwardly convexly curved shell portion (8).
A heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised
in that extending in parallel relationship to the secondary feed conduit

(3) on its side remote from the casing tubes (1) is a vapour feed conduit
(5) to which are connected the heating tubes (2) which are passed

transversely through the secondary feed conduit (3).
A heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised
in that the heating tubes (2) ar
e wound in a helical configuration in the
casing tubes (1) at a spacing from the mouth opening (4) thereof into the

secondary feed conduit (3), wherein the outer winding diameter is equal
to the inside diameter of the casing tube (1) and a displacement body (9)

is arranged in the interior of the windings.
A heat exchanger according to claim 5 characterised in that in
the wound region the heating tubes (2) are in the form of ribbed tubes

with tube windings which are disposed in mutually close relationship.
A heat exchanger according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised
in that at the upstream end (1") the casing tubes (1) are connected by a

respective laterally fitted connection (10) to a common secondary return
conduit (11), which extends beside the casing tubes (1), for the

secondary heating medium, and that the ends (2') of the heating tubes
(2), at the condensate end, are each axially passed through the end wall

of their casing tube (1) and are connected to a common condensate
collecting conduit (12).
A heat exchanger according to claim 7 characterised in that the
secondary feed and return conduits (3, 11) as well as the vapour feed 

conduit (5) and the condensate collecting conduit (12) can be selectively
connected with a respective one of their two conduit ends or with their

two conduit ends to the feed and return for the secondary heating medium
or to the common vapour feed and the common condensate return

respectively.
