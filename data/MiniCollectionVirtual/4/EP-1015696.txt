<ABSTRACT>
In a suction mould (1) comprising a mould-surface structure (4) having openings (4'') allowing passage of the liquid but not of the fibres, in the form of closely spaced through-going ducts supported against the force of the suction by a backing structure (5), and adapted to be connected to a source (not shown) of sub-atmospheric pressure, for making a thin-walled article (not shown) by suctioning said slurry against the surface of the mould, the novel feature is that the mould-surface-structure (4) and the backing structure (5) are integral parts of a common coherent body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a liquid-permeable suction
mould, said method being of the kind set forth in the preamble of claim 1, as well as a
suction mould, said mould being of the kind set forth in the preamble of claim 8.When producing articles of pulp to be used as protective packaging elements in connection
with the packaging of consumer goods of the type changing in appearance frequently,
typically in the course of a year or two, such as electronic equipment of the type mobile
telephones, electrical household devices, video cassette recorders, etc., frequently
having an irregular three-dimensional surface, it is necessary to use moulds with a complicated
complementary three-dimensional mould surface, and at the same time, these
moulds must be very cheap to produce due to the short life span and the relatively
small-sized series of the consumer goods concerned. At the same time it is also necessary
to provide a packaging product capable of satisfying the high demands of the
manufacturers of consumer goods with regard to the properties of the protective packaging,
such as e.g. rupture strength, zones of controlled deformation, elasticity, capability
for free stacking etc., all in such a manner that the manufacturers prefer to use packaging
elements made of moulded pulp rather than those conventionally made of plastic
material for these packaging purposes.The conventionally used complicated three-dimensional suction moulds have until now
been manufactured by dividing the mould into a generally plane base part and a greater
number of smaller spatial shape elements, the latter together constituting a shape-giving
part to be placed on said base part. All the shape elements are normally and advantageously
made from a metal or a plastic material and are covered with an ordinary wire
gauze, e.g. a 50 mesh gauze of stainless steel having wires approx. 0.3 mm thick and
openings measuring approx. 0.3 mm. Only the process of covering the shape elements
with wire gauze is extremely demanding in terms of cost and resources, because it is
carried out manually, i.e. one will start off with a plain wire gauze, which is cut and
shaped to the three-dimensional shape desired and welded. The shape-giving part will 
also comprise a great number of drain holes for the liquid having a spacing of e.g. 8-10
mm.As will be evident from the preamble of claim 1, the suction mould functions as a filter,
on which fibres from the pulp are deposited to form a shell-shaped pulp article, and the
moulds

Method of manufacturing a suction mould (1) for use in making thin-walled articles
by sucking a slurry of fibre pulp against a permeable mould surface having a

shape corresponding to that of the articles to be made, said mould having through-going

ducts (2"; 4"; 6") extending from openings in said mould surface being so
dimensioned as to allow passage of the liquid, but not the fibres in said slurry, to

openings in an oppositely located surface, adapted to have suction applied to it in
order to produce said pulp article, 
characterised by
 the use of a material

to a predetermined pattern in such a manner that the layers co-operate to
form a mould in one piece having the desired shape including said ducts, said

mould having a thickness (M
