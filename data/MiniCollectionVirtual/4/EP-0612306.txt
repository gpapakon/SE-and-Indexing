<ABSTRACT>
An oxygen-fuel firing system for a furnace comprising separate, spread apart nozzles for introducing gaseous streams of oxygen and fuel into the furnace at spaced apart locations. The gaseous streams merge within the furnace away from the furnace walls and crown. Thus, the main combustion within the furnace takes place in the central portion of the furnace where a broad flame cloud is created. The broad flame cloud provides a more uniform temperature profile within the furnace for a more efficient processing of materials being melted in the furnace.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the firing of furnaces using relative pure oxygen, at 
least 90% oxygen, as the oxidant for a gaseous or liquid fuel it 
is known to use various kinds of burners to achieve the desired 
result as described in U.S. patents 3,592,622, 4,376,205, 
4,531,960, 4,541,796, 4,622,007, 4,642,047, 4,690,635, 4,761,132, 
4,986,748, 5,145,361, 5,147,438, and Combustion Tec, Inc's 
Cleanfire (trademark) burner. All of these burners introduce the 
oxygen into the furnace in close proximity to the fuel stream 
creating an intense flame of concentrated energy in the furnace. 
When several of these burners are placed in a furnace wall in 
spaced apart arrangement and fired, a plurality of intense flames 
are created with relatively cooler spaces between the flame 
boundaries. This condition, though improved over previous air-fuel 
firing technology for applications such as glass melting, 
still leaves room for improvement in temperature uniformity of 
the furnace and the work product in the furnace.  
 European patent EP-A-0335728 teaches a furnace which 
is a special kind of oxygen boosted regenerative 
furnace. It uses preheated air intentionally which 
contains only about 21% oxygen. Further, GB-A-143049 
discloses improvements in gas-heated glas melting 
furnaces having a combined burner block of a suitable 
refractory material, having two oval passages, the 
lower for the inlet glass being preferably 
horizontal, the upper passage inclined, so that the 
air strikes the gas at the position for melting. It is an object of the present invention to create a 
method and device for an economical and improved 
furnace firing system which eliminates the 
disadvantages of the prior art. The present invention relates to a new and improved 
furnace firing system and method of firing a furnace 
according to the features of claims 1 and 14. While 
the method is applicable to a broad range of 
furnaces, it is particularly applicable to furnaces 
used for melting processing processes such as glass 
melting processes. In the present invention conventional oxy fueled 
burners are not used. Instead, oxygen streams are 
introduced into the furnace.  
 
through one or more of the walls and/or the roof of the furnace
