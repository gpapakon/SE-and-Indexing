<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly (1) comprises, a 
first electrical connector (2), electrical contacts (7) 

in the first electrical connector extending to a mating 
face (6) of the connector (2), alignment posts (12) and 

first ground contacts (10) along the alignment posts 
(12), both of which project beyond the mating face (6); 

and another, mating electrical connector (3) provided 
with post receiving cavities (11) with second ground 

contacts (10) in the cavities (11) engaging the first 
ground contacts (10) along the posts (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical connector
with alignment posts that project beyond a mating face of the
connector to align the mating face with another, mating
electrical connector.According to US-A-4,842,543, a known electrical connector
comprises an insulating housing having a mating face for
engaging another mating connector, electrical contacts in the
housing extending toward the mating face, and posts projecting
beyond the mating face. The posts serve as obstructions to
protect the contacts from being damaged. The posts align the
mating face with another mating electrical connector prior to
connection of the mating face with the mating electrical
connector. The posts provide obstructions without a ground
connection to an electrical terminal in the connector.According to US-A-4,904,194, grounding pins project from
an electrical connector and the pins incorporate springs that
bias the grounding pins sideways against sides of sockets in
another mating electrical connector. The pins establish a
ground connection between the connector and the mating
electrical connector without establishing a ground connection
to an electrical terminal in the connector.US-A-4,998,892 discloses a connection system in which a
receptacle connector is accurately guided into a mated
condition with a plug connector mounted on a circuit board by
a pair of guide pins projecting forwardly from the plug
connector and having tapered conical front pin ends which are
received in corresponding holes of the receptacle connector
prior to any engagement of the mating contacts. The guide
pins are conductive and become electrically engaged with
socket contacts in the corresponding holes to establish
grounding between the connectors. An objective of the present invention is to provide an
electrical connector assembly comprising matable electrical
connectors having alignment members fitted with ground
contacts which extend along the alignment members and which
can discharge an electrostatic charge to ground potential
prior to connection of other electrical contacts of the
connectors.The present invention consists in an electrical connector
assembly comprising first and second matable electrical
connectors having matable electrical contacts secured therein
for electrical connection when the electrical connectors are
mated together, and ground contacts for electrical connection
when the connectors are mated together, characterized in that
insulative alignment posts and cavities are provided on the
matable connectors, and the

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector assembly comprising first and
second matable electrical connectors (2,3) having matable

electrical contacts (7) secured therein for electrical
connection when the electrical connectors are mated together,

and ground contacts (10) for electrical connection when the
connectors are mated together, characterized in that

insulative alignment posts (12) and cavities (11) are provided
on the matable connectors (2,3), and the ground contacts (10)

extend along the alignment posts and cavities and, when the
connectors are mated together, electrically engage each other

before engagement of the electrical contacts (7).
An electrical connector assembly as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the alignment cavities (11) are disposed on one of the

matable connectors (2,3) and the alignment posts (12) are
disposed on the other.
An electrical connector assembly as claimed in claim 1
or 2, wherein the alignment posts (12) are formed at opposite

ends of one of the connectors (2,3) and the ground contacts (10) extend along the inside
surfaces thereof.
