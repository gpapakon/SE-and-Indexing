<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing an optically active alcohol. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a process for producing an 
optically active alcohol by reducing a prochiral ketone 
with a boron hydride type reducing agent modified with an 
optically active amino alcohol represented by the general 
formula (I) 
 
wherein R1 is an aryl group, R2 is a lower alkyl group, R3 
is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, and the carbon 
atoms having a mark * are an asymmetric carbon atom. We have found that optically active boron hydride type 
reducing agents obtained by reacting an optically active 
amino alcohol (I) with an acid and a metal borohydride are 
useful as asymmetric reducing agents for reducing ketones 
to obtain optically active corresponding alcohols. The 
finding was disclosed in, for example, JP-A-59-184168, JP-A-61-68471, 
JP-A-61-18722, JP-A-62-10024, US-A-4760149, EP-A-0171175, 
EP-A-0142566 and EP-A-0170350. We have also made a further study of the process of 
producing an optically active alcohol by the use of a boron 
hydride type reducing agent modified with the optically 
active amino alcohol (I). As a result, it was found that  
 
an optically active alcohol can be produced very 
efficiently by reacting a prochiral ketone compound with 
(1) a salt between the optically active amino alcohol (I) 
and an acid, and (2) a metal borohydride in the presence of 
(3) water. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a process for producing an optically active alcohol 
represented by the general formula (IV) 
 
wherein R4 and R5 are different from one another and each is 
a C1-6 alkyl group, a C6-17 aryl group, a C7-11 aralkyl group 
or a 2-substituted-1-triazoleethylene group represented by 
the general formula (III) 
 
(R6 is a halogen- or halomethyl-substituted or 
unsubstituted phenyl group or a cycloalkyl group) 
   by reducing a prochiral ketone compound represented by 
the general formula (II)  
 
 
wherein R4 and R5 are as defined above 
   with a boron hydride type asymmetric reducing agent 
modified with an optically active alcohol represented by 
the general formula (I) 
 
wherein R1 is an aryl group selected from a phenyl group 
optionally substituted with halogen, C1-5 alkyl, C1-5 alkoxy, 
cyano, C7-10 aralkoxy, C6-10 aryloxy or C1-6 alkoxycarbonyl and 
a naphthyl group optionally substituted with halogen, C1-5 
alkyl, cyano, C1-5 alkoxy or C1-5 alkoxycarbonyl, R2 is a C1-4 
alkyl group, R3 is a hydrogen atom or a C1-4 alkyl
