<ABSTRACT>
A roofrack for motor vehicles is described having two rail bars or tubes (3) which extend longitudinally on the vehicle roof (1) on both sides of the vehicle and two transverse rods (4) which are fastened to the bars or rail tubes (3), each have a longitudinal channel (7) which is open at the top end is designed to have rear undercuts (6) for accommodating accessories and which are adjustable and displaceable along the length of the bars or rail tubes (3) in order to adopt a relatively large selectable distance from one another when a load is to be accommodated on them in the position of use and in order, in the non-use position, when no load is to be transported, to be at no distance from one another or only at a small distance from one another. Provision is made for there to be a covering profile strip (8) for the transverse rods (4) which covers both transverse rods (4) in the non-use position and which is positively connected to the transverse rods (4) by means of longitudinal ribs (9) on its rear, and is held against the transverse rods (4) in this manner. The covering profile strip (8) makes it possible to leave the transverse rods (4) constantly against the bars or rail tubes (3) and it avoids the formation of irritating noise during travel and soiling of the transverse rods (4).

A rack for vehicles with two on both sides of 
the vehicle roof (1) longitudinally positioned rails 

or tubular handrails (3) and with two transverse rods 
(4), which are fixed to the rails or tubular 

handrails (3), the rods being provided with a 
longitudinal upward open channel (7) with undercuts 

(6) for the fitting of components and the rods being 
movable and adjustable in the longitudinal direction 

of the rails or tubular handrails (3), in order to be 
selectively fixed at a relative great distance from 

one another, in the position of use when a weight is 
to be put on them, and in order to be positioned one 

against the other or at a short distance in the 
position of non-use, when there is no weight to be 

transported, characterized in that when the 
transverse rods (4) are in the position of non-use 

there is provided a formed profile cover (8), which 
is in material connection with the transverse rods 

(4) and therefore is held on the transverse rods (4) 
by means of longitudinal ribs (9) which are provided 

on their backside. 
A rack according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the formed profile cover (8) is formed as an 

aerodynamic wing or spoiler.  
 
A rack according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the material of the formed profile cover (8) is 

rubber or plastic. 
A rack according to at least one of the claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the formed profile cover 

(8) is a section of an extruded profile. 
A rack according to at least one of the claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the longitudinal ribs (9) 

of the formed profile cover (8) are provided with a 
thicker head (10) in material connection with the 

longitudinal channels (7) of the transverse rods (4). 
A rack according to at least one of the claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the formed profile cover 

(8) is provided with a longitudinal rib (9) between 
the transverse rods (4) which comprises a thicker 

head (10) at the end of the rib. 
A rack according to at least one of the claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the longitudinal ribs (9) 

of the formed profile cover (8) are provided at their 
front ends with a notch (15) which allows the 

insertion of a closure bolt (12).
