<ABSTRACT>
The turret punch press (1) comprises :
 

   a C-shaped main frame (3);
 

   a workpiece transfer and positioning device (9) ;
 

   at least a freely rotatable upper turret (21, 21B) 
a freely rotating lower turret (25, 25B) respectively 

supporting a plurality of punches (19) and a plurality 
of dies (23);

 
   a striker (17) provided on the main frame (3, 3U) 

for striking the punches (19), and at least
 

   a holder frame (31, 31B) having an upper arm (33U) 
and a lower arm (33L), respectively supporting said 

upper turret (21, 21B) and said lower turret (25, 25B). 
In order to prevent the reaction forces generated 
during the punching operation and transferred by the 

striker (17) to the upper arm (34) of said main frame 
(3) from bending up wardly and deforming said upper arm 

and from inclining the striker axis with respect to the 
vertical axis thereby deteriorating the punching tools 

(19), the holder frame (31, 31B) is mounted on a tie-rod-shaped 
vertical shaft (27) in the opening (5) of 

the main frame (3), and,
 

at the end section of said opening (5), the upper and 
lower ends of the tie-rod-shaped vertical shaft (27) 

are respectively secured to the ends of the upper (3U) 
and lower frame arms (3L) of said main frame (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a turret punch 
press, and, in particular, to a turret punch press 
comprising: 
a C-shaped main frame having an upper frame arm 
and a lower frame arm; a workpiece transfer and 
positioning device for supporting a plate-shaped 
workpiece in a freely transferable manner in the X-axis 
and Y-axis directions on the main frame; at least a 
freely rotatable upper turret supporting a plurality of 
punches for punching the workpiece and at least a lower 
turret supporting a plurality of dies to co-operate 
with the above-mentioned punches; a striker with free 
vertical motion provided on the main frame for striking 
the punches, and at least a holder frame having an 
upper arm and a lower arm, the freely rotatable upper 
turret and the freely rotatable lower turret being 
respectively provided on said upper arm and said lower 
arm. A turret punch press with such a configuration is 
known by EP-A-0 310 908 (Figs. 1 and 2). In such a known turret punch press, the striker 
and the corresponding punch and die vertically aligned 
with said striker are located very close to the open 
end of the C-shaped main frame. As a consequence, the 
reaction forces generated during the punching operation 
and transferred by the striker to the upper arm of said 
C-shaped frame bend and deform the outer end of said 
upper arm upwardly so that the striker axis becomes 
inclined with respect to the vertical axis of the 
corresponding tool pair (punch and die) and the precise 
location of holes punched into the workpiece is more or 
less affected and the tools may be deteriorated in the 
long run by the inclined strokes of the striker.  
 It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a turret punch press of the above mentioned 
type in which the negative influence of the reaction 
forces of the striker on the main frame and on the 
precise location of the holes punched into the 
workpiece is avoided or at least largely attenuated. This object is achieved according to the present 
invention by the fact that 
in a turret punch press according to the preamble of claim 1, 
the holder frame is mounted 
on a tie-rod-shaped vertical shaft in the opening 
formed between the upper frame arm and the lower frame arm 
of 
the C-shaped main frame and that, at the end section of 
said opening, the upper and lower ends of the tie-rod-shaped 
vertical shaft are secured to the ends of the 
upper and lower frame arms respectively of said C-shaped 
main frame. Thanks to the proposed features, the upper and 
lowe
