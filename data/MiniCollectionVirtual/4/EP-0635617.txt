<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transparent so-called flame-shielding (fire-stop) panel capable of retarding the propagation of flames and/or fumes or gas during a fire and including a glazed element comprising tempered (quenched) silicate-soda-lime glass equipped with means capable of fastening it to a supporting structure of a building. It is designed so as to be able to deform freely when it is heated up by fire, leaving peripheral clearances measured when cold between the glazed element and the fastening means and/or between fastening means and supporting structure which are sufficient to permit its expansion.

Transparent, fire-retarding panel (31) able to retard the propagation 
(2, 3, 25, 33, 34, 35) of flames and/or fumes or gases in the case of a 

fire and incorporating a glazed element (1, 21, 22, 32) having one or more 
soda-lime-silica glass plates, whereof at least one has undergone a thermal 

tempering treatment and equipped with means able to fix it to a load-bearing 
structure of a building, the glazed element being able to freely deform during 

its heating during a fire, the total of the peripheral clearances measured 
cold between the glazed element and its means for fixing to the load-bearing 

structure and between said means and said structure being sufficiently 
large to permit the free expansion of the glazed element caused by 

its heating, characterized in that the fixing means (2, 3, 25, 33, 34, 35) 
equipping the glazed element (1, 21, 22, 32) on at least one o
f its sides 
only cover the periphery of the glass plate (1, 22, 32) having undergone 

thermal tempering by a distance from its edge equal to a maximum of 15 mm 
and preferably 10 mm. 
Panel according to claim 1, characterized in that the glass plate or 
plates of the glazed element having undergone thermal tempering have a 

thickness greater than 5 mm, in that their edges are polished with a roughness 
of the finish lower than 5 Âµm and that their tempering stress exceeds 

120 megapascals and is preferably approximately 140 megapascals. 
Panel (31) according to claim 2, characterized in that the glazed 
element (1, 21, 22, 32) has a single glass plate with a thickness of approximately 

6 mm. 
Panel (31) according to claim 2, characterized in that the glazed 
element (1, 21, 22, 32) is a laminated glass, having inter alia at 

least two tempered glass plates, each with a thickness greater than or equal 
to 6 mm. 
Panel (31) according to claim 4, characterized in that the laminated 
glazing has a single, intercalated polyvinyl butyral film with a thickness 

below 1 mm. 
Panel (31) according to claim 2, characterized in that the glazed  
 

element (1, 21, 22, 32) is a insulating glazing (20), whereof at least the 
glass plate (22) on the side opposite to the fire is of a tempered glass 

according to claim 2. 
Panel (31) according to claim 6, characterized in that the plate or 
plates (21) exposed to the fire are of normal tempered glass or laminated 

glass. 
Panel (31) according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that the insulating 
glazing (20) has a balancing element limiting the overpressure when 

the glazing is exposed to the fire. 
Panel (31) according to one of the claims 6 to 8, characterized in that 
the glass plates are assembled at their periphery with a silicone-based 

adhesive (24). 
Panel (31) according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the maintaining of the glazed element (1, 21, 22, 32) in the fixing 

means (2, 3, 25, 33, 34, 35) having the form of a frame or bead (35) is 
ensured with the aid of a fibrous material (40) interposed between the two, 

in particular having a ceramic or metallic nature. 
Panel (31) according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that it is intended to be placed in the upper part of rooms as a separating 

element, the means (33, 34, 35) for fixing the glazed element to the load-bearing 
structure of the ceiling type being designed in such a way as to 

leave visible at least one of the sides of said glazed element (32), particularly 
the lateral borders and most of the lower border of the glazed 

element (32) once fixed to the load-bearing structure according to a substantially 
vertical plane. 
Panel (31) according to claim 11, characterized in that the means 
(33, 34, 35) for fixing the element (32) to the load-bearing structure 

incorporate support means (33) for part of the lower border of the glazed 
element (32) once fixed to the load-bearing structure, notably at the 

corners of said border.  
 
Panel (31) according to claim 11 or 12, characterized in that the means 
933, 34, 35) for fixing the element (32) to the load-bearing structure 

incorporate means (35) for maintaining at least one of the borders of the 
glazed element (32), particularly solely the upper border of said element 

(32) once fixed to the load-bearing structure, said maintaining means comprising 
a frame or a bead preferably only covering at the most 15 millimetres 

of the periphery of the border measured from its edge and ensuring 
sealing with respect to the gases between the border and the frame or bead.
