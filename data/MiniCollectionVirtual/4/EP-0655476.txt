<ABSTRACT>
Fibrous preforms comprise at least one fibrous 
mat with its shape stabilized by a macrocyclic 

poly(alkylene dicarboxylate) oligomer composition 
substantially free from linear species and free from 

polymerization catalyst. Cyclic poly(1,4-butylene 
terephthalate) oligomer mixtures are preferred. The 

resulting preforms retain their shape and may be used in the 
formation of prepregs and resinous composites.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 
shaped polymer composites, and more particularly to 
preforms for such composites. A fibrous preform is a fibrous article, typically 
a mat, stably maintained in a specific contour convenient 
for consolidation into a finished composite article. The 
contour and thickness usually correspond to those desired in 
the finished article. Preferably, the preform is further 
characterized by a minimum of excess bulk and loose 
strands. It is often originally fabricated as a roll of 
material resembling fabric, which may be shaped, combined 
with resin or other impregnating material and consolidated 
in a press, autoclave or mold, after which the resin may be 
cured to form the finished composite article. The preform should be easily handled without 
damage and should be structurally stable in typical 
environments. Other desirable criteria are low labor costs, 
rapid fabrication and minimization of waste. One of the major problems in preform 
fabrication is assurance of proper placement and integrity 
of the fibrous reinforcement. Fillers employed in 
composites, such as glass or graphite fibers, are not 
drapable. That is, the fibers deform elastically and always 
return to their original shape when the deforming stress is 
removed. They also suffer from inadequate tack, i.e., 
adhesion between layers, as between woven and non-woven 
portions of a fiber mat. As a result, fiber lay-up can be a 
time-consuming and expensive process, and complex  
 
geometries of good integrity can be difficult or impossible 
to obtain. Three techniques have generally been employed 
for the conversion of fibrous mats into shaped composite 
articles. One is to simply cut the mat to the appropriate 
shape and place it in the mold or other forming tool. This 
method is useful only for parts which are planar or very 
nearly so. A second technique is to employ such operations 
for mat fabrication and assembly as braiding, formation of 
a three-dimensional woven structure or stitching; such 
operations are applicable to only a limited range of 
structures and can be labor-intensive. The third technique is the employment of a 
binder to maintain integrity of the preform, as disclosed, 
for example, in U.S. Patent 5,071,711. Materials useful as 
binders generally have at least limited adhesive properties. 
When applied to the mat, they hold the preform together 
during handling and enable it to maintain the desired shape 
prior to placing in the mold. Many woven and non-woven mats are
