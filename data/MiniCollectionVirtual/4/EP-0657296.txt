<ABSTRACT>
A paper feeder for use in an image forming apparatus 
for forming images on a printing paper, including a 

primary paper feeding mechanism (17) which sends out printing 
sheets one by one at a predetermined speed and a 

secondary paper feeding mechanism (4) which sends out each of 
the printing sheets fed from the primary paper feeding 

mechanism (17) to a printing portion at a speed corresponding 
to the printing speed of said printing portion, the 

printing portion being rotated at a speed selected from 
plural stages of rotational speeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper feeder for
use in an image forming apparatus which forms images on a
printing paper and more particularly to a paper feeder
for separating and feeding sheets of printing paper
placed on a paper feeding stand.Fig. 6 is a side view of an image forming apparatus,
showing a stencil printer. A stencil obtained by a
thermal process is affixed to the outer periphery of a
drum 50 which constitutes a printing portion, and
printing paper P is fed continuously between the drum 50
and a press roller 50a to effect stencil printing in
accordance with images on the stencil.Sheets of printing paper P, which stacked on a paper
feeding stand 51, are picked up one by one successively
from the top and fed toward the drum 50 by means of a
scraper roller 52 and a pickup roller 53, both
constituting a primary paper feeding mechanism 57. On
the side opposed to the pickup roller 53 are disposed a
separator means and an overlap detecting means (neither
shown) to separate the paper sheets one by one without
overlapping and feed them toward a secondary paper 
feeding mechanism 58.Between the drum 50 and the pickup roller 53 is
disposed a timing roller 60 which constitutes the
secondary paper feeding mechanism 58, and by operation of
the timing roller 60, each sheet of printing paper P is
fed toward the drum at a predetermined timing which is
synchronized to the rotation of the drum 50, and printing
is performed.Thus, the stencil printer is provided with the
primary and secondary paper feeding mechanisms 57, 58.
The reason why the stencil printer has such two stages of
paper feeding mechanisms is that the stencil printer
operates at a higher speed in comparison with printers at
large, e.g. copying apparatus. The primary paper feeding
mechanism 57 functions to take out printing sheets P one
by one from the paper feeding stand 51 positively without
overlapping at a relatively low speed, and the secondary
paper feeding mechanism 58 functions to feed the printing
sheets P thus taken out to the drum 50 at a high speed
corresponding to the rotational speed of the drum which
is rotating at a high speed.In the stencil printer, the printing speed is
variable and can be adjusted stepwise from low (e.g. 60
rpm) to high (e.g. 130 rpm).A belt 66 is stretched between the drum 50 and a
plurality of idlers 55 as well as a rotating shaft 65a of
a motor 65, and by operation of the motor 65 the drum 50 
is rotated. The primary and secondary paper feeding
mechanisms 57, 58 also utilize the driving force of the
m

<CLAIMS>
A paper feeder for an image forming apparatus,
comprising a primary paper feeding means (17) for removing

paper sheet from a stack and feeding the paper to a
secondary paper feeding means (4) for feeding the paper to

an image forming drum of a printing station at predetermined
times characterised in that:


the primary paper feeding means (17) is driven by a
primary drive means (18) and the secondary paper feeding

means (4) and the image forming drum (1) are driven by a
secondary drive means (2), which drive means (18,2) are

separate from one another;
the primary feeding means (17) is arranged to feed
said paper sheet during a primary feed cycle at a

predetermined speed independent of the printing speed of
the image forming apparatus; and
the secondary paper feeding means (4) is arranged to
receive each of the paper sheets fed from said primary

feeding means (17) and is arranged to feed the paper sheet
to the image forming drum at a speed corresponding to a

printing speed of the image forming drum.
The feeder according to claim 1, wherein the
primary driving means (18) intermittently drives the

primary paper feeding means (17)
at said predetermined speed, for example the driving

means (18) drives the primary paper feeding means at a
predetermined part of the image forming cycle of the image

forming apparatus.
The feeder according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein the primary feeding means (17) includes at least

one transport roller (24, 25) and a separating roller (23)
adapted to feed said paper sheet during a primary feed

cycle, and further, wherein, the separating roller (23) is
adapted to drive paper in a direction opposed to the paper

feed direction, and optionally the separating roller (23)
includes a torque limiter whereby the at least one

transport roller (24, 25) is able to overcome the counterforce
of the separating roller (23) on a single sheet of

paper, and optionally the primary drive means (18) drives 
the rollers (23, 24, 25) in a stepwise manner within each

primary feeding cycle.
The feeder according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the secondary drive means (2) is

continuously driven during the image forming cycle and
includes clutch means (5) thereby the secondary feeding

means (4) being controllably driven and optionally includes
a brake.
The feeder according to any one of the preceding
claims, further including control means (30) to control the

drive means (2, 18) during an image forming cycle.
The feeder according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein

said printing portion is rotated at a speed
selected from plural stages of rotational speeds.
The feeder according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the primary paper feeding means (17) includes a

pickup roller (24) which comes into contact with each of
printing sheets on a paper feeding stand (27) and takes it

out from said stand (27);

a separating roller (23) disposed in an opposed
relation to said pickup roller (24) and functioning to send 

out the printing sheets one by one;
the primary drive means (18) comprises a primary motor
(18) for rotating said pickup roller (24) intermittently at

a constant speed;
the secondary drive means (2) comprises a secondary
motor (2) for rotating a printing portion at a speed

selected from plural stages of rotational speeds; and
the secondary feeding means (4) includes a timing
roller (15) connected to said secondary motor (2) and

conveyed thereto by both said pickup roller (24) and said

separating roller (23) to said printing portion at a speed
corresponding to the printing speed of the printing

portion.
The feeder according to claim 7, wherein said
separating roller (23) is provided with an urging means for

urging the separating roller in a rotating direction
opposite to the rotating direction adopted for sending out

the printing sheets so that in the event of overlap of
printing sheets taken out by said pickup roller (24) the

printing sheet which has come into contact with said

separating roller (23) can be conveyed back in the
direction opposite to the printing paper feed direction.
The feeder according to claim 7 or claim 8,
wherein a clutch (5) for transferring the driving force of

said secondary motor (2) to said timing roller (15), or for
cutting off said driving force thereto, is provided between

the secondary motor (2) and the timing roller (15), and the
timing roller (15) is driven by operating said clutch (5)
