<DESCRIPTION>
The invention in general relates to the structure and fabrication of electrical
devices such as integrated circuits and more particularly to a new class of materials
that provide low fatigue ferroelectric devices, reliable high dielectric constant
devices, and are resistant generally to degradation in electronic applications.It has been known for many years that ferroelectric materials have
polarization states that can be selected or switched by application of an electric
field, and that these polarization states remain after the electric field is removed. It
is well-known that if a ferroelectric capacitor is substituted for the conventional
silicon dioxide dielectric capacitor in a conventional memory, such as a DRAM,
instead of simply storing a charge that leaks off quickly, the capacitor can be
switched between selected polarization states that will remain indefinitely after power
is removed. Further, it is well-known that ferroelectric materials are much more
resistant to radiation damage than conventional memory materials, and do not need
high voltage for writing or erasing as conventional non-volatile memories. Thus,
considerable research and development has been directed toward ferroelectrics
over the last thirty years. However, only a few specialty ferroelectric integrated
circuits have been commercially produced. United States Patent No. 5,028,455
issued to William D. Miller et al. and the article "Process Optimization and
Characterization of Device Worthy Sol-Gel Based PZT for Ferroelectric Memories",
in Ferroelectrics, Vol 109, pp. 1-23 (1990) summarize the various ferroelectric
materials utilized in non-volatile memories. These materials include potassium nitrate
(KNO3), PLZT (PbLa2O3 - ZrO2 - TiO2), lead zirconate titanate or PZT (PbTiO3 -
PbZrO3), and lead titanate (PbTiO3), with PZT currently being the material of choice.
These ferroelectric materials are all random solid solutions meeting the general
perovskite formula ABO3.A key problem in producing a non-volatile ferroelectric memory has been that
up to now every ferroelectric material that has had acceptably high polarizability to
be useful for a non-volatile memory has also been characterized by a high fatigue
rate. That is, under repeated switching, the polarizability gradually decreases to less
than 50% of the original polarizability. Moreover, when a series of pulses of the 
same sign are applied to the prior art materials, they take a set, or an imprint. As
a result, when a field is applied to switch the material, it takes a
