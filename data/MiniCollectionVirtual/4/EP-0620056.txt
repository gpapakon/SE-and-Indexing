<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a tubular structural 
member (10) which can longitudinally vary in wall 

thickness and/or perimeter, and possibly material, 
using the hydroforming process. This is accomplished 

by first fabricating a tube blank of the desired 
longitudinal combination of wall thickness, perimeter 

and material by welding together portions of tubing 
(18,20) having the desired characteristics and then 

hydroforming the resultant blank. The hydroformed 
part will have nearly the same thickness, perimeter 

and material characteristics as the blank in the 
corresponding longitudinal location.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of 
forming a tubular structural member. Hydroforming, the use of fluid pressure to 
expand a tube or tube blank to comply with the shape 
of an enclosing die, is effective at providing tubular 
parts with a cross-sectional shape varying along their 
longitudinal axes. The cross-sectional shape of the 
resultant structural member is often appreciably 
different from the cross-sectional shape of the tube 
blank. Box shaped cross sections are commonly formed 
from cylindrical tube blanks. These cross-sectional 
shapes, however, will have a nearly constant wall 
thickness when the perimeter remains fairly constant 
along the length of the resultant structural member. Conventional hydroforming, where the forming 
is essentially limited to pressurising the tube blank 
to force it to conform to an enclosing die, produces 
little change in the length of a part. The length of 
the formed part is essentially equal to the length of 
the tube blank. For this reason, the cross-sectional 
area of the formed tube wall tends to remain constant 
along its length, equalling that of the tube blank. 
The constant area means that there is generally a 
tradeoff made between section perimeter and the local 
wall thickness. Hydroforming will generally increase 
perimeter and decrease wall thickness. It is 
appreciated that a variant form of hydroforming called 
bulge forming produces parts shorter than the tube 
blank to provide an increase in perimeter with little 
or no associated decrease in wall thickness. However, 
bulge forming requires a longitudinal loading of the 
blank simultaneous with the pressurisation of the 
blank. Permissible perimeter expansion of the 
tubing with conventional hydroforming is limited by  
 
the ductility of the tube material. More ductile 
material can sustain a greater amount of expansion. It is often highly desirable to produce 
parts having wall perimeters and/or wall thicknesses 
which vary locally along the length of the formed part 
by more than the amount available with conventional 
hydroforming, such as a tubular member with a 
localised 100 percent increase in wall thickness, or 
with a localised increase in perimeter of 100 percent. 
Unfortunately, conventional hydroforming does not 
readily lend itself to providing a part with such 
localised variations. One approach to using conventional 
hydroforming to provide parts satisfying 
longitudinally varying thickness and perimeter 
requirements is to let the maximum perimeter and 
thickness

A method of forming a tubular structural 
member (10;50) having selectively localised longitudinal 

variation in wall thickness and/or perimeter, comprising 
the steps of forming a first tube (18;54) having a first 

diameter (d1) and a first wall thickness (t1); forming a 
second tube (20;56) having a second diameter (d2) and a 

second wall thickness (t2), the first diameter (d1) being 
different from the second diameter (d2) and/or the first wall 

thickness (t1) being different from the second wall 
thickness (t2); welding an end of the first tube (18;54) to an end of 

the second tube (20;56) either directly end to end or by way of 
a transition tube (58) having said first diameter (d1) at one 

end and said second diameter (d2) at the other end to form a 
longitudinal tube blank (26;52); enclosing the tube 

blank (26;52) in a die (36) having co-operating die sections 
(40,42) defining a longitudinal cavity (34); and 

hydraulically pressurising the tube blank (26;52) from inside 
thereof thereby forcing the tube blank (26;52) radially outward 

relative to the longitudinal axis (28;60) of the tube blank into 
conformance with the longitudinal cavity of the die. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the first diameter (d1) is larger than the second diameter (d2), 

wherein said end of the second tube (56) is flared out 
to a diameter substantially equal to the first diameter (d1) 

before directly welding the said ends together. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the first diameter (d1) is larger than the second diameter (d2), 

wherein said end of the first tube (54) is tapered down 
to a diameter substantially equal to the second diameter (d2) 

before directly welding the said ends together. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the first diameter (d1) is larger than the second diameter (d2), 

wherein said end of the second tube (56) is flared out  
 

to a diameter intermediate the first and second 
diameters (d1,d2), and said end of the first tube (54) is 

tapered down to said intermediate diameter before 
directly welding the said ends together. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 4, further comprising the step of smoothing an 

outside surface of the tube blank (26) at the position 
of the or each weld before enclosing the tube blank (26;52) in 

the die (36). 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 5, wherein the first tube (18;54) is formed of a 

material which is different to the material of the 
second tube (20;56).
