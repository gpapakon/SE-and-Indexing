<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing a method of continuously 
carburizing a metal strip, which is capable of providing industrially 

optimum carburization conditions while attaining non-soot-generating 
atmospheric data, desired carburization concentration 

distribution and desired carburization rate, in a case 
where a strip passed through a carburization furnace is carburized 

continuously in a surface reaction rate-determining region 
in which the carbon concentration in a superficial layer of the 

strip has not yet reached an equilibrium level with respect to the 
time. The method consist of carburization concentration distribution 

(S7), on the basis of the carburization conditions including 
given specification data for the steel plate, furnace temperature 

and composition of the atmospheric gas, outputting the concentration 
of the components of the atmospheric gas, feed and discharge 

rates and other carburization conditions when the set 
carburization rate and an actual carburization rate are equal 

(S8-S15), and correcting the set carburization rate when a difference 
between the set carburization rate and an actual carburization 

rate is large, and correcting the strip feed rate while correcting 
the composition of the atmospheric gas when a difference 

between the predetermined carburization and set carburization 
rate is large (S9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a continuous 
carburizing method in the case of continuously gas 
carburizing a metal strip. For example, in the case of 
continuously gas carburizing a strip consisting of extremely 
low carbon steel by plate-passing from an annealing furnace 
to a carburizing furnace (for the purpose of carburizing 
with a desired carburizing quantity), the strip which is 
plate-passed at a plate-passing speed set under operation 
conditions other than a carburizing treatment reaches an equilibrium 
concentration between the strip and an atmospheric gas in a surface 
reaction-governing area before a carbon concentration in a surface layer 
of the strip. Also for the purpose of obtaining a desired carburizing 
concentration distribution in the steel, the present 
invention controls the atmospheric gas 
composition, the gas concentration, the furnace 
temperature, the metal strip temperature, the plate-passing 
speed, etc., as atmospheric factors which do not generate 
sooting. For example, in metal secondary working industries,  
 
the compatibility of 
higher workability with strength is required with respect to a metal plate which is the object of working. 
Specifically, in the above-mentioned automobile industries, from the need to make the body light in weight 
in order to seek low fuel consumption in view of the earth environmental problem which has been raised 
recently, there is a requirement of a steel plate which has a higher strength while maintaining a deep 
drawing property provided heretofore. As evaluation indices for such a metal plate, for example, an elongation index, a deep drawing property, 
an aging index, a strength, a secondary working brittleness, a baking hardening property, a spot welding 
property, etc., may be considered. Thus, when the deep drawing property is evaluated by a Lankford value 
(hereinafter referred to as r value: metal plate width strain / plate thickness strain) by placing great 
importance on the deep drawing property, it is known that the reduction of the amount of carbon 
(hereinafter referred to as C) in the steel is most advantageous, and in addition, by this low carbonization, 
the elengation index (El) and the cold-slow-aging index (Al: the lower the Al, the better) are also improved. 
However, on the other hand, when the amount of C in the steel decreases, most of the other evaluation 
indices are deteriorated. For example, since the structure strength is lowered due to reduction of 
precipitation, a tensile strength (ST) is decreased,
