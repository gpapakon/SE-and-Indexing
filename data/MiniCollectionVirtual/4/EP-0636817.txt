<ABSTRACT>
In case where an engine rotational detection signal 
from an ignition pulse generator is not appropriately 

detected even if an amount of induction air and a fuel 
injection amount are larger than predetermined values, an 

engine rotational signal failure is decided, and an 
automatic transmission is controlled in a state before the 

decision. Thus, the automatic transmission 
control can be executed based on the engine rotational 

speed. In case where a 
failure of the cruise control set signal line is detected, 

the automatic transmission control based on the cruise 
control is prohibited. The normal state is recovered when 

an off signal of the cruise control set is detected in the 
above-described conditions. Accordingly, since a failure 

of the cruise control set signal line is reliably detected, 
the automatic transmission control is appropriately 

executed by using the cruise control signal. Thus, the 
automatic transmission control can be executed based on a 

cruise control signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a failure detecting
system for an automatic transmission of a vehicle employing
an engine rotational speed, a cruise control signal, a
brake signal from a brake switch or a shift range switch
operation signal from a shift range switch as one of
control signals to control the automatic transmission.An automatic transmission AT is fundamentally
controlled to be shifted by regulating depression of an
accelerator pedal and a traveling speed of a vehicle.
Accordingly, in case where the vehicle travels in a drive
(D) range, reduction gears can be shifted by positively
depressing or releasing the accelerator pedal.In a conventional automatic transmission, for example,
in a drive (D) range, an optimum gear is selectively
controlled from a vehicle speed at that time and a throttle
opening according to a shift map storing a predetermined
shift schedule as shown in Fig. 6.As a lockup function of an automatic transmission a
lockup clutch is engaged when a vehicle speed becomes
higher than a predetermined value in a certain gear
position such as, for example, in a third gear or an 
overdrive (fourth gear), to directly couple an output shaft
of a torque converter to an output shaft of an engine. In
other cases, the lockup clutch is released to connect the
input shaft of the torque converter to the output shaft of
the engine.The lockup is released to utilize a function of the
torque converter thereby to achieve smooth starting, smooth
accelerating or smooth speed shifting without engine
knocking or stop at the time of starting, abruptly
accelerating, speed shifting the vehicle.However, in a state that a load is low and an engine
rotational speed is high, the torque converter is locked up
thereby to prevent loss of power due to a slip of the
torque converter and hence to prevent a increase in fuel
consumption.A cruise control unit so controls an opening of a
throttle valve as to maintain a certain vehicle speed set
by a driver as a desired traveling speed thereby
controlling in response to a road state.As the typical automatic transmission control to
execute as described above, Japanese Utility Model
Application Laid-Open 63-115558 discloses an internal
combustion engine with an abnormality detector for judging
an abnormality based on a rotational speed signal from a rotation
detector for electrically detecting a rotational speed of 
the internal combustion engine and a fuel amount signal
from a fuel amount detector for detecting a fuel supply
amount to the internal combustion engine.In
