<ABSTRACT>
A system for heating two independent water supplies having a water storage tank 
adapted to contain a first, potable water supply and a coiled heat exchange tube mounted 

within the tank to contain and conduct a second, non-potable water supply. The tank has 
a top, bottom, wall, and flue communicating between the top and bottom. The tube is 

in communication with the exterior of the tank and with a circulatory space heating 
system. The tube has a double wall to protect against the mixing of the potable and non-potable 

water supplies, and the ends of the tube terminate at the surface of the water 
storage tank at a dielectric fitting which maintains electrical isolation between dissimilar 

metals otherwise exposed to the water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combined water heating system for domestic or 
commercial use which is capable of heating water for consumption as well as for space 
heating. The system heats potable water for consumption while exchanging heat to a 
recycling water-based space heating system. The combined water heating system 
provides this function while maintaining separation between the potable and non-potable 
water supplies. There has long been a need for compact appliances to be installed within living 
areas in single and multi-family dwellings as well as in commercial establishments. 
Stackable washer and dryer units, combination cooktop and oven units, and other compact 
appliances have been developed to satisfy this need. Several attempts have been made to provide a combined water and space heating 
appliance to satisfy the need for a compact system for supplying hot water. For example, 
U.S. Patent No. 1,070,175, issued to Ponninghaus, discloses a boiler having a coil to 
conduct water to be used for such purposes as heating rooms or the like. The '175 
system, however, cannot be used with a standard glass-lined water heater system, and 
degradation of the '175 system may lead to the mixing of potable and non-potable water 
supplies. These drawbacks are also inherent in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,704,188; 3,793,992; 
and 3,828,847. All traditional combined water heating systems exhibit one or more of several 
critical shortcomings. The lack of protection against the mixing of potable and non-potable 
water creates a significant hazard to consumers of water heated in such systems. 
Moreover, traditional combined water heating systems accelerate the decay of the water  
 
heater system, thereby increasing maintenance requirements and reducing the cost 
effectiveness of such systems. Traditional combined water heating system 
designs are also inappropriate for use with standard glass-lined water heaters. 
Lastly, traditional combined water heating systems are inefficient and are not 
capable of practical use. Accordingly, there is a long-standing and thus far unsatisfied need for a 
compact, inexpensive and efficient water heater system capable of providing hot 
potable water simultaneously with heated water for space heating. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved water heating 
system for domestic or commercial use capable of heating water for consumption 
as well as for space heating. Another object of this invention is to provide a 
water heating system that is compact in size so as

<CLAIMS>
A water heating system for heating two water supplies, comprising: 
   a water storage tank adapted to contain a first water supply, said water 

storage tank having a top, a bottom, a wall, and a flue communicating between 
the top and bottom of said water storage tank; 

   a direct firing gas burner to heat the first water supply within said water 
storage tank; 

   a tube adapted to contain a second water supply for circulation to a radiant 
space heating system, said tube being mounted within said water storage tank 

proximal to said flue and in communication with the exterior of said water 
storage tank, said tube having a double-wall construction with a non-metallic 

outer wall over a metallic inner wall so that said outer wall provides a barrier 
between first water and second water that may leak through said inner wall, and 

said inner wall provides a barrier between second water and first water that may 
leak through said outer wall; and 

   a means for sealing between said tube and said tank such that said first and 
non-potable water supplies do not mix. 
A water heater system as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that said 
inner metallic wall is formed from aluminium, copper, stainless steel, or carbon 

steel. 
A water heater system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 characterised in that said 
outer non-metallic wall is formed from polyethylene, polypropylene, or high 

density polyethylene. 
A water heater system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that said tube is coiled about said flue. 
A water heater system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that said tube terminates at the walls of said water storage tank. 
A water heater system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that said tube terminates in the top of said water storage tank. 
A water heater system according to any of Claims 1 to 6 characterised in 
that it comprises a dielectric fitting assembly adapted to create a seal between 

said double-wall tube and said water storage tank to prevent the mixing of first 
and second water supplies while maintaining dielectric isolation between the inner 

wall of said double-wall tube and said water storage tank. 
A water heating system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7 characterised 
in that the inner wall of said double-wall tube has an outside diameter of about 

0.625 inches and a wall thickness of about 0.035 inches, and the outer wall of 
said double-wall tube has an outside diameter of about 0.665 inches and a wall 

thickness of about 0.020 inches. 
A water heating system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 8 characterised 
in that said coiled double-wall heat exchange tube has about 22.5 coils and an 

overall length of about 80 feet. 
A water heating system as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 9 wherein said 
first water supply is a potable water supply and said second water supply is a 

non-potable water supply.
