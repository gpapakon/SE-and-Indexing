<ABSTRACT>
A silica coating is formed on an electronic 
substrate by applying a silazane polymer on the substrate and 

converting it to silica by heating in an oxidizing 
environment. The resultant thick planarizing coatings are 

useful as protective coatings and dielectric inner layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
applying silica coatings on electronic substrates wherein
silazane polymers are used as precursors to silica coatings.Various methods for the application of ceramic
coatings on electronic devices are known in the art. For
instance, it is known to use gaseous precursors in a variety
of vapor deposition processes to produce coatings of silica,
silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride and silicon carbide.
These coatings are taught to be useful as protective and
dielectric layers.Similarly, the use of polymeric precursors for
depositing ceramic coatings on electronic devices is also
known in the art (Haluska et al. in U.S. Patents 4,749,631
and 4,756,977). The Accuglass™ product literature also
disclose silica coatings produced by applying solutions of
silica precursors to electronic devices and then heating the
coated devices to convert the precursors to silica. These
references. however, fail to disclose or suggest the use of
polysilazanes as the silica precursors.The use of polysilazanes for applying
silicon and nitrogen containing ceramic coatings on
electronic devices is also known in the art. For example,
Haluska et al. in U.S. Patents 4,756,977 and 4,826,733 teach
forming ceramic coatings by applying coatings of silicon and
nitrogen containing polymers, such as polysilazanes. on such
devices and then heating the coated devices in an inert
atmosphere. Since the coatings are heated in an inert
atmosphere, the nitrogen is maintained in the coating and
silica is not formed. European Patent No. 0 218 117 describes the use of
substituted cyclosilazane polymers as a spin-on dielectric
film material. The polymers of this patent are derived
from a class of compounds known as cyclosilazanes
(silylamines, more generally) having the general formula
(R1R2SiNH)n wherein R1 and R2 are H, aliphatic C1-12 groups
or C6-15 aryl groups and n has a value of 3 or 4.European Patent No 0 559 394 is relevant in
accordance with the provisions of Article 54(3) and (4)
EPC, and describes a process for fabricating an integrated
circuit device, such as a semiconductor, which comprises
the step of planarization by coating a polysilazane onto
a surface of a substrate and curing or oxidizing the
coated polysilazane to obtain a planarization layer of
silicon dioxide. The polysilazane used in this invention
is a polymer containing Si-N bonds in the molecule and
preferably does not contain hydroxide or oxygen. We have now found that silica coatings derived from specific
silazane polymers can be
