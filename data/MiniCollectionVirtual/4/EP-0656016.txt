<DESCRIPTION>
In one aspect, the invention applies to a 
cationically curable release composition which contains 
no silicone component and which is rapidly curable by 
exposure to ultraviolet light. In another aspect the invention relates to a 
commercially feasible and economically prepared release 
coating composition which is compatible with a wide variety of 
conventional substrates. Release coatings are substances which control or 
eliminate the adhesion between an adhesive and a 
substrate surface, many of which have been prepared using 
silicone based materials. Curing of such silicone based 
liquid release coatings has been accomplished by solvent 
removal and thermal crosslinking, as is taught in U.S. 
US-A- 4,151,344. However the removal of solvent is 
not only energy intensive but also raises environmental 
concerns over solvent removal and recovery. To obviate 
this disadvantage, solvent free "100% reactive" organo 
polysiloxane compositions such as those taught in 
US-A- 4,057,596 have been developed. These 
coatings, based on platinum catalyzed hydrosilation 
reactions, address the issue of solvent omission but are 
nevertheless energy intensive. Additionally, curing 
temperatures are typically within the range of from 140 
to 160Â°C., thus precluding their use on temperature 
sensitive substrates. When applied to paper at these 
temperatures, the release coated paper has a tendency to 
curl and drastically change dimensions during thermal 
cure as dehydration of the paper substrate takes place.  
 
UV-curable release coatings in the absence of solvent is 
therefore desirable, since these coatings can be cured at 
room temperature. Free radical initiated systems based on thiol-ene 
reactions are described in US-A- 3,816,282. 
These systems, however, have an offensive mercaptan odor; 
moreover, thiol-ene systems are known to cure slowly and 
are thus commercially not attractive. Although the 
cationically curable epoxy and vinyloxy organo 
polysiloxanes described (US-A- 4,617,238 and 
4,279,717) cure rapidly with UV exposure and provide 
excellent low or "easy" release, in practice these UV-curable 
release coatings have several limitations. 
First, while UV-curable silicone release coatings can 
readily provide a low energy surface for easy release, 
coating formulations with controllable level of release 
are difficult to achieve. Attempts to counter this with 
control release additives have been only partially 
successful in developing moderate release properties. 
Secondly, many potential consumers
