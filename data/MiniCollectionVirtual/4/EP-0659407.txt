<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical 
compositions containing a pyrylium compound, a 

thiopyrylium compound, a selenopyrylium compound or a 
telluropyrylium compound or a salt of any of the 

aforesaid compounds as active ingredient. The compounds 
are selectively absorbed by cancer cells or similar 

growths in the human or animal body and can be used to 
bring about distruction of the unwanted growth on 

irradiation with light of wavelength 600nm to 1000nm. 
The invention also provides a method for the treatment 
of the human or animal body which comprises administering 

the compound to a human or animal and irradiating a locus 
in said animal where the compound is absorbed in order 

to kill cells at that locus. It further comprises the 
use of the aforesaid compound for the making of a 

medicament for use in the treatment of cancer in humans 
and animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
composition containing a pyrylium compound, thiopyrylium
compound, selenopyrylium compound or telluropyrylium
compound (hereinafter referred to as "a pyrylium
compound") or a salt of any of the aforesaid compounds
as active ingredient. It also provides a method for the
treatment of the human and animal body which comprises
administering the compound to a human or animal and
irradiating a locus in said animal where the compound is
absorbed in order to kill cells at that locus. It
further comprises the use of the aforesaid compound for
making a medicament for use in the treatment of cancer
in humans and animals.In the pharmaceutical field, one of the most important
problems is to find medicaments for use in the treatment
of cancer. One approach to the treatment of cancer is
to use photochemistry. Extensive research has been
carried out into the photochemical treatment of cancer,
and it has been put into clinical use since 1976. There
is an extensive journal and patent literature concerning 
photochemical treatments for cancer, see for example the
general remarks of Michael J. Manya (J. Clin. Oncology,
vol. 6, 1988, pp. 380-391). In these literature and
patent references almost all the medicaments which have
been adminstered to enable photochemical treatment to be
carried out contain a porphyrin compound, particularly
hematoporphyrin derivatives (HPD) or diamatoporphyrin
derivatives (DHE) which have been applied clinically, and
a medicament called PHOTOFRIN which contains DHE is
expected to be marketed shortly by LEDERLE JAPAN Co. Ltd.The way in which photochemical treatment is carried out
using a medicament containing a porphyrin-type compound
will now be explained. When this medicament is given to
a patient suffering from cancer, then almost all the
active material is metabolised by normal cells in a few
days (48 to 72 hours). However, medicament absorbed by
cancer cells is not metabolised, and the amount thereof
that builds up in the cell is from several times to
several tens of times that in a normal cell. Then the
cancer cells and surrounding tissue is irradiated with
light of frequency 600-700nm, and the cancer cells in
which the medicament has built up die preferentially
whilst normal cells are generally unaffected by the
radiation. Accordingly, it is possible to treat cancer
in this way without producing unacceptable side effects.
The reason why the medicament remains preferentially in 
the cancer cells is not clear, but it is believed to be
the
