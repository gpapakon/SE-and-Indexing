<ABSTRACT>
A divided flywheel device has a first flywheel mass (3), provided with an axial bearing arrangement (19, 20) for a hub disc (10) and formed in the circumferential area with a radial bearing (16) for the hub disc (10), as well as a second flywheel mass (12), rotatable in synchronism with the hub disc (10) and capable of limited rotation relative to the first flywheel mass (3). In this flywheel device, the axial bearing (19, 20) is to be arranged in such a way that sufficient supply of the same with lubricant is always ensured on the one hand and optimum axial guidance of the hub disc (10) can be achieved on the other hand. To achieve this object, the axial bearing (19, 20) is provided with travel limits for the hub disc (10). The travel limits extend on both sides of the hub disc (10) up to the radial bearing (16).

Split flywheel assembly which comprises a first flywheel (3) which 
preferably engages the crankshaft (1) of an internal combustion 

engine and a second flywheel (12) connected to the first through a 
torsional vibration damper (30) and being allowed limited relative 

rotation with respect to the first flywheel (3), one of the flywheels 
(3) being designed to receive a hub disc (10) of the torsional 

vibration damper (30) with an axial as well as a radial bearing 
(17, 15) of which the latter has on that bearing portion (16) which 

serves for radially guiding the hub disc (10) a respective radially 
extending limb (37, 41, 46) as an axial bearing (17) on each side of 

the hub disc (10),
 
characterised in that,
 
the limbs (37, 41, 46) are formed by respective discs (19, 20) 

which are located on a substantially axially extending portion of the 
radial recess (14) in the flywheel (3) which supports them. 
Split flywheel assembly according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
each disc (19, 20) of the axial bearing (17) is connected to a limb 

(38) of the bearing portion (38, 42) of the radial bearing (15) which 
extends substantially perpendicular to it to form a respective 

half-shell (36). 
Split flywheel assembly according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the bearing portion (42) of the radial bearing (15) is interrupted by 

axially extending recesses (45).  
 
Split flywheel assembly according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the discs (19, 20) are each interrupted by recesses (47) extending 

radially with respect to the axis of the hub. 
Split flywheel assembly according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the discs (19, 20) of the axial bearing (17) are provided on at least 

one side of the hub disc (10) with segments (51) to form the 
engaging faces for the hub disc (10). 
Split flywheel assembly according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the hub discs (10) has segments (53) within the region of extent of 

the discs (19, 20) of the axial bearing (17) to form an engaging 
face. 
Split flywheel assembly according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the sides of the hub disc (10) are provided with segments (52) in 

the region of the respective radially outer edge. 
Split flywheel assembly according according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the radial bearing (15) has segments (50) on its radial inside to 

form the engaging face for the hub disc (10).
