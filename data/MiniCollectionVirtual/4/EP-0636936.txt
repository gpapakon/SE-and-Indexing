<ABSTRACT>
Photographic elements comprising certain 2-phenylcarbamoyl-1-naphthol 
couplers exhibit proper hue, 

a resistance to dye crystallization, and a resistance 
to leuco cyan dye formation. Such couplers can be 

utilized for their image-modifying effect and can 
contribute substantially to the overall dye density of 

an image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
elements and to novel two-equivalent 2-phenylcarbamoyl-1-naphthol 
couplers. Modern photographic materials, particularly 
color negative films, contain a variety of so-called 
image modifying couplers including development 
inhibitor releasing (DIR) couplers, switched or timed 
inhibitor releasing (DIAR) couplers, bleach accelerator 
releasing couplers (BARCs) and colored masking 
couplers. DIR couplers, such as those described in 
U.S. Patent 3,227,554, and DIAR couplers, such as those 
described in U.S. Patent 4,248,962, perform such useful 
functions as gamma or curve shape control, sharpness 
enhancement, granularity reduction and color 
correction. BARCs, such as those described in European 
Patent Application 193,389, facilitate the oxidation of 
developed silver in bleach solutions. They may also 
enhance silver developability, thereby affecting gamma. 
Masking couplers, such as those described in J. Opt. 
Soc. Am, 40, 171 (1950) and in U.S. Patent 2,428,054, 
are used to correct for the unwanted absorptions of 
various imaging dyes. Modern color negative films often contain 
both image couplers, which contribute solely to the 
production of dye, and image-modifying couplers, such 
as those described above. The image-modifying 
couplers, in addition to having an image modifier 
component (e.g. bleach accelerator or development 
inhibitor), also comprise an image dye parent. In  
 
films which comprise both image couplers and image-modifying 
couplers, much of the ultimate color density 
exhibited by the film is often derived from the parent 
of the image-modifying coupler. Many films today contain large amounts of 
such image-modifying couplers in the red-sensitive, 
cyan-dye-containing layers. These image-modifying 
couplers typically have cyan image dye parents which 
generate cyan dye upon reaction of the image-modifying 
couplers with oxidized developer. Because such cyan 
dye substantially contributes to the total red density 
in these films, it is important that the dyes generated 
from the image-modifying couplers have suitable 
properties. Desirable properties include good hue, 
good stability, resistance to reduction in seasoned 
bleaches or in bleaches of low oxidising strength, and 
resistance to hue changes on storage at low 
temperatures. Resistance to reduction in seasoned bleaches 
is particularly important because certain cyan dyes are 
prone to being reduced by ferrous ion complexes (such 
as ferrous EDTA) and other reducing agents, which
