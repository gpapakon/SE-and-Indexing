<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tissue paper webs. More particularly, it 
relates to soft, absorbent tissue paper webs which can be used in 
toweling, napkins, and facial tissue products. Paper webs or sheets, sometimes called tissue or paper tissue webs 
or sheets, find extensive use in modern society. Such items as paper 
towels, napkins, and facial tissues are staple items of commerce. It has 
long been recognized that three important physical attributes of these 
products are their softness; their absorbency, particularly their 
absorbency for aqueous systems; and their strength, particularly their 
strength when wet. Research and development efforts have been directed 
to the improvement of each of these attributes without deleteriously 
affecting the others as well as to the improvement of two or three 
attributes simultaneously. Softness is the tactile sensation perceived by the consumer as 
he/she holds a particular product, rubs it across his/her skin, or 
crumples it within his/her hand. This tactile sensation is a combination 
of several physical properties. One of the more important physical 
properties related to softness is generally considered by those skilled 
in the art to be the stiffness of the paper web from which the product is 
made. Stiffness, in turn, is usually considered to be directly dependent 
on the dry tensile strength of the web. Strength is the ability of the product, and its constituent webs, to 
maintain physical integrity and to resist tearing, bursting, and 
shredding under use conditions, particularly when wet. Absorbency is the measure of the ability of a product, and its 
constituent webs, to absorb quantities of liquid, particularly aqueous 
solutions or dispersions. Overall absorbency as perceived by the human 
consumer is generally considered to be a combination of the total  
 
quantity of liquid a given mass of tissue paper will absorb at saturation 
as well as the rate at which the mass absorbs the liquid. The use of wet strength resins to enhance the strength of a paper 
web is widely known. For example, Westfelt described a number of such 
materials and discussed their chemistry in Cellulose Chemistry and 
Technology, Volume 13, at pages 813-825 (1979). Freimark et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,220 issued August 28, 1973 
mention that certain chemical additives known as debonding agents 
interfere with the natural fiber-to-fiber bonding that occurs during 
sheet formation in papermaking processes. This reduction in bonding 
leads to a softer, or less harsh, sheet
