<ABSTRACT>
The tubing clamp serves to selectively shut off or open tubes, e.g. infusion tubes. It possesses the shape of an essentially U-shaped plastic bracket having comparatively rigid legs (10, 12) on the insides of which there are formed projections (16, 17; 18, 19) which interact on squeezing of the tube, as well as a flexible web (14). The free ends of the legs (10, 12) can be locked in the shut-off position, and one end (20), as well as the web (14), is provided with a hole for passing-through of the tube. In order to prevent faulty operation due to tilting it is intended that marginal flanges (24) be formed on both lateral edges of a leg (10) or on opposite lateral edges of the two legs (10, 12). On pushing together, the projections (16, 18) are located between these marginal flanges without play or with little play.
