<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of omnidirectional radio frequency antennae. The antenna consists of a flat printed circuit (11), on which the radiating dipoles are etched, and a radio frequency reflector (12, 13) formed, for example, by two pyramidal segments, placed together by their small bases clamping the said flat radiating circuit between them. The invention applies more particularly to emergency beacons.
