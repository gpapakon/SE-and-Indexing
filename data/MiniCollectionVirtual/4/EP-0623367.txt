<DESCRIPTION>
Exercise machines for physical development and 
rehabilitation uses are well known and take a variety of forms. 
Typical forms include: user operated free weight machines, such 
as chest press, shoulder press, etc. on which weights are lifted 
along a straight line of either standard resistance or variable 
resistance form; cam operated machines to obtain a desired force 
curve; machines in which the user exercises against a pneumatic 
force, etc. Each such machine is designed to exercise one or 
more groups of muscles of an extremity or part of the body in a 
certain manner, i.e. to provide resistive force for the user to 
exercise against in a predetermined and position determined way. 
The force vs. position relationship is often called the force 
curve or force profile. Typically, there are three modes of exercises that a 
user wishes to perform, these being the isometric, isotonic and 
isokinetic. 
a) In isometric mode exercises, the rate of angular 
change or velocity of the part of the body being exercised is 
zero, while the force can be applied in either of two directions. 
That is, the exercise is at zero velocity and only heat is developed 
as the user pushes or pulls against a non-movable object.  b) In isotonic mode exercises, the load, or resistive 
force, has a constant value while the velocity varies. Such 
exercise mode is often performed on a standard resistance weight 
machine where weight plates are moved up and down a track as the 
user moves a lifting arm, foot pedal, etc. c) In isokinetic mode exercises, the force varies to 
match the user applied force in such a way that the velocity of 
force application is kept constant. Each user desires to perform one or more exercise modes 
to satisfy different body development or rehabilitation goals. 
Each exercise would preferably have a force curve individualized 
for the user to match his goals and his strength capabilities. 
In the past, where machines using weight plates or friction type 
devices have been employed, this has required the use of several 
different types of machines and the mechanical adjustment of the 
resistive force. Such machines also have restriction in the 
number of modes and types of exercises that can be performed. Attempts have also been made to select and control the 
exercise and its resistive force by the use of computers or microprocessors. 
See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,354,676 to 
Ariel, 3,902,480 to Wilson and 3,869,121 to 
Flowell; and European Patent Application No. 83301887.2 (Publication
