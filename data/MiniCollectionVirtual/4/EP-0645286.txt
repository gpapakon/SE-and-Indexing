<CLAIMS>
A method of operating an anti-theft device for motor vehicles, using
a number of devices which control components of the vehicle and are

unblocked if a given test information item coincides with a given
reference item and wherein the test and the reference items are

different for at least two control devices, 
characterised in that
 the
control devices themselves compare the input test information items

and, in the event of a successful comparison, deliver an individual
acknowledgement signal to the other control devices, and in that the

test and the reference information items are separate picture items
obtained from a single user's fingerprint.
