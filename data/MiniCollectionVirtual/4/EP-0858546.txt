<ABSTRACT>
A ladder (10) including: mobility means (12) displaceable between a ladder immobile position and a ladder mobile position in which the mobility means extends downwardly beyond the foot of the ladder; and manually actuable means (30, 20, 14) for displacing the mobility means from the ladder immobile position to the ladder mobile position, wherein, when the manually actuable means is released, the mobility means returns to the ladder immobile position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved default-immobile ladder.For safety reasons, a ladder must be immobile when used, ie. when a user is on the ladder. However, it is also desirable that the ladder can be rendered mobile for the purpose of moving the ladder to another location.A number of different solutions have been proposed in which some form of mobility means, such as wheels and castors, have been used, with the mobility means being movable between a retracted immobile position and a downwardly extended mobile position.It is highly desirable that the mobility means return to the retracted immobile position as a default so that, in the absence of an applied mobilising force, the ladder is immobile.A default-immobile ladder is disclosed in French Patent Publication 2,171,571. The ladder includes a rectangular frame carrying four wheels or castors. The frame can be urged downwardly in response to actuation of a lever thereby lifting the ladder and rendering the ladder mobile. The ladder returns under gravity to the immobile position when the lever is released, ie. the immobile position is the default.The present invention aims to provide an improved default-immobile ladder.In one aspect the invention resides in a default immobile ladder including:-
a plurality of mobility means simultaneously displaceable between a ladder immobile position in which the feet of the ladder contact a supporting surface and a ladder mobile position in which the plurality of mobility means extend beyond the feet of the ladder thereby lifting the feet of the ladder away from the supporting surface against the effect of gravity; andmanually actuable means for simultaneously displacing the plurality of mobility means from the ladder immobile position to the ladder mobile position,wherein a mobilising force applied to the actuable means simultaneously displaces the plurality of mobility means to the ladder mobile position, whereafter a horizontal moving force applied to the actuable means moves the mobilised ladder about on the supporting surface,
characterised in that: discontinuation of said mobilising force on the actuable means causes the plurality of mobility means to return to the ladder immobile position regardless of whether the ladder is loaded or unloaded;
the manually actuable means includes a pair of laterally spaced levers;
the mobilising force is applied to the laterally spaced levers in a substantially vertical direction; and
the moving force is applied to the laterally spaced levers in a substantially

<CLAIMS>
A ladder including:

a plurality of mobility means (12a, 12b, 12c, 12d) simultaneously displaceable between a ladder immobile position in which the feet of the ladder contact a supporting surface and a ladder mobile position in which the plurality of mobility means extend beyond the feet of the ladder thereby lifting the feet of the ladder away from the supporting surface against the effect of gravity; and
manually actuable means (32) for simultaneously displacing the plurality of mobility means from the ladder immobile position to the ladder mobile position,
wherein a mobilising force applied to the actuable means simultaneously displaces the plurality of mobility means to the ladder mobile position, whereafter a horizontal moving force applied to the actuable means moves the mobilised ladder about on the supporting surface,
characterised in that
: discontinuation of said mobilising force on the actuable means causes the plurality of mobility means to return to the ladder immobile position regardless of whether the ladder is loaded or unloaded, so that the ladder is immobile by default;

the manually actuable means includes a pair of laterally spaced levers (30A, 30B);

the mobilising force is applied to the laterally spaced levers in a substantially vertical direction; and

the moving force is applied to the laterally spaced levers in a substantially horizontal direction,

wherein the mobilising force and moving force are applied to the laterally spaced levers by a user's hands and the laterally spaced levers are adapted to receive the user's hands in horizontally spaced locations whereby steerage of the mobilised ladder on the support surface is facilitated.
A ladder as claimed in claim 1, wherein the laterally spaced levers adopt a substantially horizontal orientation when the plurality of mobility means (12a, 12b, 12c, 12d) are in the ladder mobile position.
A ladder as claimed in claim 1, wherein the laterally spaced levers are joined to form a U-shaped member (32).
A ladder as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the ladder also includes a vertically displaceable platform.
A ladder as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of the mobility means is a castor, and wherein each mobility means is pivotably mounted about a vertical axis on an up-standing post (26) which is guided for vertical movement in a bore in a housing (28).
