<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monomeric aminoplasts, process for
preparing and use of same as crosslinking agents.To effectively crosslink with a variety of widely available
difunctional materials such as diols, dicarboxylic acids,
dimercaptans, and diamides, a monomeric crosslinking agent is
required to have a functionality effective for crosslinking of
at least two. In many cases, however, even trifunctional
aminoplast crosslinking agents do not give rise to sufficient
crosslinking density in cured films or objects due to
incomplete reaction of the functional groups, and as a result,
cured films with inferior physical and resistance properties
are obtained.The problem of insufficient crosslinking density may be
overcome by using a higher functional aminoplast crosslinker
such as hexamethoxymethyl melamine. In these cases, however,
the films obtained sometimes have low flexibility due to the
somewhat rigid network produced in the films upon cure.US-A-4,230,740 discloses photopolymer compositions comprising a
polythiol; a photoinitiator and a polyene, wherein the polyene
is a hexamethylolmelamine derivative comprising at least three
polymerizable vinyl substituents.EP-A-0,366,884 discloses coating and adhesive compositions
comprising vinyl-terminated carbamylmethylated melamines and
vinyl-terminated polyurethane/polyamide polymers. EP-A-0,203,879 discloses the preparation of polymerizable
monomers prepared from 1-(1-isocynato-1-methylethyl)-4-(1-methylethenyl)benzene
and compounds containing a Zerewitinoff
active hydrogen atom.The above-identified problems of insufficient crosslinking of
the low functionality crosslinkers and the low flexibility of
the highly functional crosslinders are both overcome by using
typically tetrafunctional guanamine-derived aminoplast
crosslinking agents. However, guanamine-derived crosslinkers
are more difficult and more costly to prepare than melamine-derived
crosslinkers. Furthermore, some guanamine crosslinkers
such as N,N,N',N'-tetraalkoxymethylbenzoguanamines have
insufficient resistance properties and have inferior stability
towards the degradative action of ultraviolet light.It is the object of this invention to obtain melamine-derived,
substantially monomeric aminoplasts useful as 
crosslinking agents having olefinic functionality which are
capable of producing, upon cure, films which have good acid
resistance properties, environmental etch resistance, and a
good balance of hardness and flexibility.This object is solved by the composition according to
independent claim
