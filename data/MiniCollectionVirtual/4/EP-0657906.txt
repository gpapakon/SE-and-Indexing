<ABSTRACT>
This holder makes it possible to mount nameplates of electrical switches more quickly and cheaply. To this end, a housing cover (4) of the electrical switch (2) has on one side a cantilever arm (20) which rests against the rear side (1.1) of a panel (1). A base (21) is preferably provided on the cantilever arm (20). This base (21) projects into an opening (22) in the panel (1) and is less than the thickness of the panel (1). The nameplate (23) rests on the base (21) and is guided laterally in the opening (22) in the panel (1), being screwed to the cantilever arm (20) by means of a threaded bolt (24) which is attached to it.
