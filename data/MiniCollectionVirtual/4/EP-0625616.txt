<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for receiving loose and/or floating materials, etc., having a vat (1) exhibiting a closeable end side, and having an ejection piston (3) which can be displaced axially in said vat. Controlled movement of the ejection piston (3) and consequently a high degree of operational reliability can be achieved, in the case of said apparatus, in that the ejection piston (3) is connected, by means of at least one telescopic push and pull member (11), to a support piston (9) which is arranged in the vat (1), behind the ejection piston, which can be fixed releasably on the inner wall of the vat, from which, in the fixed state, the ejection piston (3) can be adjusted away by means of the push and pull member (11) and which, in the released state, can be brought towards the ejection piston (3) by means of the push and pull member (11).
