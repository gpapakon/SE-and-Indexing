<ABSTRACT>
A high field strength permanent magnet has a plurality of layers, with at least two of the layers being formed of materials of different remanence. The remanence of the material of each layer is no greater than that of the layers thereunder, and is preferably less than the remanence of all underlying layers. The inner layer may be formed of a magnetic structure in which all or part of a basic yoke has been replaced by a shunt of active material. Such a shunt may alternatively be employed in a single layer magnetic structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high field strength magnetic
structure having improved efficiency. While the invention is of
especial use for NMR magnets for medication applications, it
will be apparent that the invention is not so limited.A basic requirement in the design of a permanent magnet is
the efficient use of the energy stored within the magnetized
material. In general, the design should be aimed at achieving
the desired value of the intensity within the cavity of the
magnet with a minimum volume and weight of the magnetized
material.Permanent magnets can be classified as yokeless magnets
where the magnetic structure is designed in such a way that the
field in confined within the magnet without the need of a high
magnetic permeability yoke; yoked magnets where the magnetic
material is used to generate the desired field within the
region of interest and the field confinement is achieved with
an external yoke, or hybrid magnets wherein the magnetic
structure is designed to require only a partial yoke.Yokeless permanent magnets can be designed with magnetic
materials which have a quasi-linear 
demagnetization characteristic with a slope close to that of
air. In this case, the magnetic structures are transparent to
the field generated by other sources. This is an important
property of the yokeless structures, which allows the designer
to increase the strength of the field within the cavity by
superimposing the fields generated by concentric magnets.Yoked permanent magnets, on the other hand, are shielded
from external sources by the same yoke which confines the field
of the magnet. As a consequence, the field superposition
property of yokeless structure does not apply to yoked magnets
and the field strength attainable within the cavity has an
upper limit dictated by the magnet geometry. Conversely,
because the magnetic material performs only the function of
generating the field within the cavity, in general yoked
structures use less magnetic material than yokeless structures
designed for the same field strength and the same geometry of
the cavity. Thus, weight of the magnetic material may become an
important factor in the choice between a yokeless and a yoked
magnet design, particularly if the design parameters dictate
the use of high energy, high cost magnetic materials.The design methodology for two dimensional as well as
three dimensional yoked and yokeless magnetic structures
capable of generating a uniform field within 
a cavity of arbitrary geometry, and design optimization of such geometries, are
