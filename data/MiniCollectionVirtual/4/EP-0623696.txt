<ABSTRACT>
A system for feeding a plurality of strands of 
material (700) such as yarn, in unison, along an array of 

separate feed paths (700) that extend from a bank of supply 
packages (540) to a knitter head (150) utilizes a bank 

of positive drive units (620) that are arranged in an array 
that extends about the knitter head (150) to coordinate 

and uniformly tension such strand reaches as extend 
from the positive drive units (620) to the knitter head 

(150). The feeding of the strands (700) takes place while 
the bank of supply packages (540), the bank of positive 

drive units (620), the knitter head (150) and the array of 
feed paths (700) all are rotated about an axis (175) that 

extends substantially centrally among the rotating feed 
paths (700). Each feed path (700) has a first reach that 

extends from a separate supply package (542) to the capstan 
(665) of a separate one of the positive drive units 

(620), a second reach that is wrapped around the capstan 
(665) of its positive drive unit (620), and a third reach 

that extends from its positive drive unit (620) to the 
knitter head (150). The capstans (665) of the positive 

drive units (620) are power driven, rotate in unison, and 
tension the first reaches as is required to pay out the 

strands from their supply packages (542). Because the 
second reaches wrap tautly about the capstans (665) of the 

positive drive units (620) and rotate therewith at uniform 
speed, the third reaches are fed to the knitter head (150) 

at a selected uniform feed rate and under substantially 
uniform tension regardless of such variations in tension 

as may be imparted to the first reaches as they are payed 
from their supply packages (542).
