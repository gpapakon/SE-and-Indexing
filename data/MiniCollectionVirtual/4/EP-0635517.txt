<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a process for
producing 1-(2'-deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-5-trifluoromethyluracil
derivatives having anti-tumor and
anti-viral activities, as well as to a process for
producing an intermediate thereof.1-(2'-deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-5-trifluoromethyluracil
derivatives (trifluorothymidine
derivatives) are compounds which have long been drawing
attention because of their relationships between uridine
or thymidine. Since they have anti-tumor and anti-viral
activities, they are important as pharmaceuticals or
intermediates for producing the pharmaceuticals, so that
processes for producing them have been well studied. It
is well known in the field of synthetic organic chemistry
in this area that the processes for producing the
derivatives largely vary depending on the type of the
base in the nucleoside, so that a suitable production
process should be studied for each type of the bases.
For example, as described in Nucleic Acids Research 12,
6827 (1984) or in Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 8, 549
(1989), bases of nucleic acids, such as uracil,
fluorouracil, thymine and trifluorothymine have largely
different properties because of the difference in the 
substituent group on 5-position. Therefore, a production
process by utilizing glycosylation must be developed for
each of the above-mentioned bases. Especially, 5-trifluoromethyluridine
has chemical properties largely
different from those of uridine and thymidine because of
the influence by the trifluoromethyl group, so that 5-trifluoromethyluridine
cannot be produced well by a
production process analogous to the process for producing
uridine or thymidine. Further, if a compound having 2'-deoxy
structure in the sugar moiety is produced by a
conventional process, the selectivity of α and β
isomers is low, so that it is difficult to selectively
obtain the necessary β isomer alone.Known processes for producing 1-(2'-deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-5-trifluoromethyluracil
derivatives include:
(1) A process in which the base of thymidine is
exchanged with 5-trifluoromethyluracil by nucleoside-2'-deoxyribose
transferase or the like (M.G. Stout et al.,
Methods Carbhydr. Res., 7, 19 (1976);(2) A process in which the halogen atom at 5-position of
a 1-(2'-deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-5-halouracil
derivative is reacted with trifluoromethylcopper (Y.
Kobayashi, et al., J.C.S. Perkin Trans I, 2755 (1980));(3) A process in which a thymidine derivative and
trifluoroacetic acid are subjected to electrolysis
reaction (L. Hein, et
