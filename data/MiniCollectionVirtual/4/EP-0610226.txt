<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an air control system which is retrofittable in an intermediate position between upstream compressors (130) and air storage vessels and downstream useful production equipment (140) to provide benefits of greater air-utilization efficiency and a better air system balance between supply and demand, especially on an air-weight flow basis. A preferred embodiment employs a plurality of servo-driven flow controllers (30) in parallel between a pair of header tanks (22) and controls them in response to sensed downstream pressures and to the pressure differential across the control system. Another embodiment includes control means to manage the loading and unloading of compressors to and from the air system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to control systems for
pneumatic plant supplies and is particularly, although not
exclusively, concerned with an improved air control system
for compressed air supplies used to power industrial or 
commercial equipment, and to a complete air system which
integrates such air control system with air compressor
means and useful air-powered equipment.Many factories use compressed air as a major source of
power for operating their production machinery. The air is
typically supplied from on-site or nearby compressors and
piped to a downstream use or demand area through a
distribution system, with pressure-stabilizing storage
means being provided upstream, in the form of tanks or
receivers. Typical equipment includes pneumatically
powered machine tools, drills, wrenches, presses and
lathes, as well as mills and buffers, and low demand spray
booths and instrumentation. Such equipment is commonly
referred to in the art as the "article", a generic term
connoting anything connected to the air system to make use
of the supply.End users want the air system to maintain adequate pressure
to run their air-powered equipment and few consider the
energy costs of the air.Major changes in downstream demand create varying loads on
the compressors. Air compressors are typically controlled 
according to system supply pressure, coming on-line as
system pressure at the compressor, or nearby, drops below a
threshold pressure and going off-line at a higher cutout
pressure. This is necessarily a rather crude control
system, especially as air compressors are slow to respond
to changes. As factory production drops off, for example
at the end of a shift, air demand declines, and this
decline can be quite sudden.System pressure rises substantially to unload compressor
horsepower until compressor output can be adjusted and this
overpressure can increase the air consumption rate as
still-operating machinery uses more air and also increases
leakage. These overpressure losses constitute an
artificial demand resulting in wasted energy. Being
designed to maintain a threshold working pressure under
conditions of heavy demand, most air systems use an excess
of compressor capacity over the theoretical capacity needed
to give satisfactory operational results, with consequent
unnecessary capital expenditure and running costs.Prior art pneumatic control systems generally depend upon
the above-described crude compressor switching together
with pressure regulators operating at the article to
protect individual pieces of
