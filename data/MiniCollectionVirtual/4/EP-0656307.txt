<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a cylinder for transporting signatures (29) in a folding apparatus of a web-fed rotary printing machine, the signatures (29), which are retained on their leading edge (f) by means of puncture needles (37, 38, 39), are subject, despite a high production rate, to a further-processing apparatus without being damaged. In this arrangement, the signatures (29) are arranged in a fixedly clampable manner, in their border regions (e, f), at least in the vicinity of the outer puncture needles (37, 39), on the cylinder (1) by means of controllable grippers (23, 54, 59, 63) until they are transferred.

<CLAIMS>
Cylinder, preferably folding drum (1), for
transporting signatures (29) to a further-processing

device, in particular to a cross-folding device of a
web-fed rotary printing machine, the cylinder (1)

having a number of controlled pins (37, 38, 39), so
that the signatures (29) can be held on the cylinder

(1) in the region (f) of their leading edge (31),
characterized in that controllable clamping devices

(23, 54, 59, 63) which act on an edge region (e, f) of
the signatures (29) are provided and clamp the

signatures (29) firmly on the outer surface (32) of the
cylinder (1).
Cylinder according to Patent Claim 1,
characterized in that the clamping devices (23, 54, 59,

63) comprise controllable grippers (23, 54, 59, 63).
Cylinder according to Patent Claim 2,
characterized in that the grippers (23) are arranged in

a plane at right angles to the direction of rotation
(B) of the folding drum (1) such that they can be

pivoted by means of a gripper holder (24) about a
bearing (22) that is fixed to t
he folding drum, and in
that the gripper holders (24) are each connected, via a

rocker (26) and a coupler (28), to a second arm (17) of
a two-armed lever (17, 16) which is mounted in a fixed

position on the folding drum and whose first arm (16)
is connected at its second end to a cam mechanism (18,

19).
Cylinder according to Patent Claim 2,
characterized in that the gripper (54; 59), with its

gripper tip (56; 61), is connected in a plane with the
direction of rotation (B) of the folding drum (1) in an

articulated manner, via a plunger (52) which is guided
in a pivotable linear guide (53) that is mounted in a

fixed position on the folding drum, to a second arm 
(17) of a two-armed lever (17, 16) which is mounted in

a fixed position on the folding drum and whose first
arm (16) is connected at its second end to a cam

mechanism (18, 51), so that the gripper tip (56, 61)
describes an elliptical curve before being placed on

the signatures (29).
Cylinder according to either of Patent Claims 3
and 4, characterized in that provision is made for a

number of grippers (23, 59) acting on the long-side
edge region (e) of the signatures (29), between the

leading edge (31) and the end of the signatures (29).
Cylinder according to either of Patent Claims 3
and 4, characterized in that the drive (17, 21, 27, 22;

17, 21, 52, 53) to grippers (23, 59) is in each case
arranged between the long side (42, 43) of the

signatures (29) and an end plate (6, 7) of the folding
drum (1).
Cylinder according to Patent Claim 2,
characterized in that further grippers (54) which act

on the outer surface (32) of the folding drum (1) are
arranged in the axial direction (2), in a front edge

region (f) and at a distance (g) from one another.
Cylinder according to Patent Claim 6,
characterized in that the drive (17, 21, 52, 53) to

grippers (59) is in each case arranged between the long
side (42, 43) of the signatures (29) and an end plate

(6, 7) of the folding drum (1), and in that the gripper
(59) is of L-shaped design at its gripper tip (61).
Cylinder according to Patent Claim 8,
characterized in that a gripping bar (63) which is

pivotable and runs in the axial direction (2) is
provided.
Cylinder according to Patent Claim 9,
characterized in that the gripping bar (63) has a drive

(17, 21, 52, 53, 59, 61) which is arranged between the 
long side (42, 43) of the signature (29) and an end

plate (6, 7) of the folding drum (1).
