<ABSTRACT>
To supply distributed circuit arrangements having preferably identical structures with reference currents, a current source arrangement is proposed which has a current source which generates a reference current which, with the aid of a plurality of parallel-connected transistors which are arranged spatially close to one another, into a number of reference currents corresponding to the plurality. The transistors are included in a control for the reference current, that is to say for the sum of the reference currents, and are connected at the output end to the distributed circuit arrangements.

Current source arrangement in an integrated
circuit for producing multiple reference currents for

distributed circuit arrangements,

having a plurality of transistors (N1 ... N3),
which are arranged spatially close together and whose

load paths are connected in parallel,

characterized in that
an operational amplifier (OA) is provided,
whose first input is connected to a reference potential

(VR) and whose second input (VF) is connected to a
centre tap between the parallel circuit formed by the

load paths of the transistors (N1 ... N3) and a
resistance element (R) connected in series therewith,

and in that
a reference-earth current (IB) is thereby
defined in the load circuit of the transistors (N1 ...

N3),
the transistors (N1 ... N3) being driven via an
output (VO) of the operational amplifier (OA), as a

result of which the reference-earth current (IB) is
divided into a number of reference currents (I1 ... I3)

corresponding to the number of transistors (N1 ... N3),
which reference currents each supply one of the

distributed circuit arrangements (B1, B2, B3).
Arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterized
 
in that transistors (N1 ... N3) are dimensioned

identically.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized

in that a capacitive element (TC) is connected in
parallel with the load paths of the transistors (N1 ...

N3) for the purpose of smoothing.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized

in that one of the distributed circuit arrangements
(B1, B2, B3), which each have a current source

arrangement (P11, P12; P21, P22) controlled by the
respective reference current (I1, I2, I3), is connected

in series into the load paths of each of the
transistors (N1 ... N3).
Arrangement according to Claim 4,

characterized

in that the current source arrangements (P11, P12; P21,
P22) are designed as cascode stages, the reference

current (I1, I2, I3) formed on the output side by each
of the transistors (N1 ... N3) in each case controlling

a first transistor (P11) of the cascode stages, the
load path of which transistor is connected to the load

path of a second transistor (P12) in such a way, and in
that a regulating transistor (P13) is provided for the

purpose of regulating the potential at a centre tap
between the load paths of the first and second

transistors (P11, P12).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized

in that each of the reference currents (I1 ... I3) is
mirrored by the respectively assigned distributed

circuit arrangement (B1, B2, B3). 
Current source arrangement according to one of
the preceding claims in a multiple digital-to-analogue

converter.
