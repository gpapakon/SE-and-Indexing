<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a drive-in expansion dowel for anchorage in a cylindrical bore, which dowel has a conically tapering expansion region with a narrowing inner bore (6) into which an expansion peg (4) can be driven. Formed on the expansion peg (4) is an annular groove (20) in which there is located a steel ring (21) which projects beyond the annular groove (20). In the anchored state, when the expansion sleeve (1) is expanded, the steel ring (21) presses against the inner wall of the expansion sleeve (1) and thus secures the expansion peg (4) in said expansion position.

Impact-type expansible plug for anchorage in a 
drilled hole (23) in a concrete part (24) or similar 

masonry with a longitudinally slit expansion sleeve (1) 
which can be expanded in the drilled hole (23) and into the 

conically narrowing internal bore (6) of which an expansion 
mandrel (4) can be driven, and with a radially resilient 

element (21) which, in its unstressed state, projects at an 
outer surface of the expansion mandrel (4), 
characterized 
in that
 the as yet unexpanded expansion sleeve (1) tapers 
towards its forward free end (9) as far as an annular 

collar (10), which has a radially directed cutting edge 
(11), and in that the resilient element is a steel ring 

(21) with a hollow profile which presses with its spring 
force from inside against the conically narrowing internal 

bore (6) of the expanded expansion sleeve (1). 
Impact-type expansible plug according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that
 the expansion mandrel (4) has a 
conical extension (5) which during the expansion process 

engages in the conically narrowing internal bore (6) of the 
expansion sleeve (1), and in that in the region of the 

transition from the conical extension (5) to a cylindrical 
part (19) of the expansion mandrel (4) an annular groove 

(20) is formed on the expansion mandrel (4), in which 
groove lies the steel ring (21). 
Impact-type expansible plug according to Claim 2, 

characterized in that
 the steel ring (21) has a V-shaped 
profile, the open side of which points towards the bottom 

(29) of the annular groove (20). 
Impact-type expansible plug according to Claim 2, 

characterized in that
 the steel ring (21) has a C-shaped  
 

profile, the open side of which points towards one of the 
two side walls (30) of the annular groove (20). 
Impact-type expansible plug according to one of 
the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 when the 
expansion mandrel (4) is driven into the expansion sleeve 

(1), on the forward free end (9) of the expansion sleeve 
(1) the internal bore (6) has a counter slope (28) which 

widens conically outwards and against which the resilient 
element (21) is radially braced. 
Impact-type expansible plug according to one of 
the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 on the end (13) 
of the expansion sleeve (1) there is placed a spacer cap 

(14) which has a receiving chamber (15) for the conical 
extension (5) of the expansion mandrel (4) driven in when 

the expansion sleeve (1) is expanded.
