A process for preparing 13-(Z)-retinoic acid of 
the formula I 


 
by 


a) reacting 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-2(5H)-furanone of the 
formula II 


 
with a C
15
-triarylphosphonium salt of the formula 
III 


 
where R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 are each aryl and X
⊖
 is halogen 
or HSO
4
-
, in the presence of an alkali metal 
hydroxide in an organic solvent and 
b) subsequently partially isomerizing the resulting 
mixture of 13-(Z)- and 11,13-di-(Z)-retinoic acid,
 
wherein the 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-2(5H)-furanone of the 

formula II is reacted in step a) with a mixture of the 
C
15
-triarylphosphonium salt of the formula III and from 2 
to 6 mol of lithium hydroxide per mol of the C
15
-triarylphosphonium 
salt of the formula III as alkali metal  

 
hydroxide in from 2 to 6 liters of dimethylformamide per 

mol of the C
15
-triarylphosphonium salt of the formula III 
as solvent at from 10 to -9°C. 
A process for preparing 13-(Z)-retinoic acid as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein the 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-2 (5H)-furanone 

is reacted in step a) with the C
15
-triarylphosphonium 
salt at from +5 to -5°C. 
A process for preparing 13-(Z)-retinoic acid as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein the 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-2 (5H)-furanone 

is reacted in step a) with a C
15
-triphenylphosphonium 
hydrogen sulfate as C
15
-triarylphosphonium salt. 
A process for preparing 13-(Z)-retinoic acid as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein the isomerization of the 

mixture of 13-(Z)- and 11,13-di-(Z)-retinoic acid in step 
b) is carried out by irradiating this mixture in an 

aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon, a halogenated 
aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon or a C
1
- to C
4
-alkanol 
as solvent in the presence of a photosensitizer with 

light in the wavelength range from 200 to 600 nm. 
A process as claimed in claim 4 or 7, wherein a 
C
1
-C
4
-alkanol is used as solvent for the isomerization of 
the mixture of 13-(Z)- and 11,13-di-(Z)-retinoic acid. 
A process as claimed in claim 4 or 7, wherein 
erythrosin B is used as photosensitizer for the isomerization 

of the mixture of 13-(Z)- and 11,13-di-(Z)-retinoic 
acid. 
A process for preparing 13-(Z)-retinoic acid of 
the formula I as set forth in the preamble of claim 1, 

wherein the isomerization of the mixture of 13-(Z)- and 
11,13-di-(Z)-retinoic acid in step b) is carried out by 

irradiating this mixture in an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic 
hydrocarbon, a halogenated aliphatic or 

aromatic hydrocarbon or a C
1
- to C
4
-alkanol as solvent in 
the presence of a photosensitizer with light in the wavelength 

range from 200 to 600 nm. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the 
isomerization of the mixture of 13-(Z)- and 11,13-di-(Z)-retinoic 

acid in step b) is carried out by irradiating 
this mixture in a C
1
- to C
4
-alkanol as solvent in the  
 

presence of a photoinitiator with light in the wavelength 
range from 200 to 600 nm.
