<ABSTRACT>
A system for notifying passengers waiting for public transit vehicles of the status of the vehicles, including the arrival times of vehicles at stops. The system includes global position determining devices located in the vehicles for determining the location of the vehicles along their routes. A central processor or computer is coupled to the global position determining devices for receiving the locations of vehicles therefrom. The processor is programmed to compute and update from the present location of the transit system vehicles and electronically stored information a transit data table which includes status information for all the vehicles in the system, including the location of scheduled stops, connections to other transit vehicles at the stops, and the arrival times of vehicles at their stops. The vehicle status and other information, including news and advertisements are then made available for public access in a manner geared to the locations of the vehicles, the time of day, day of week, date, location, season, holiday, weather, etc. Portable access means such as pagers, notebook and palm computers and telephones and stationary access means such as personal computers and telephones and display modules in communication with the central processor, receive the computed arrival time and other information for selected routes, stops, etc. from the central processor, and communicate the information to the passenger(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to scheduling
systems for public transit vehicles. It relates in
particular to a passenger information system for providing
near real time prediction of arrival times of public transit
vehicles at selected boarding or disembarkation points.Often complained of problems associated with public
transportation include time wasted waiting for public
transit vehicles to arrive at a passenger's particular
transit stop, and uncertainty as to service and/or arrival
time at transit connections or destinations. To verify this,
one need only observe bus riders standing in the street at
travel stops looking as far down the road as possible,
attempting to see the next bus, and doing so several times
in the course of waiting for even one bus. A transit
vehicle line operator usually publishes a schedule
indicating arrival and departure times of vehicles for the
line's routes. The transit vehicle line operator, however,
is often unable to maintain the schedule, particularly at
peak traffic times, for reasons such as traffic conditions,
weather conditions, passenger load, and vehicle malfunction.
Furthermore, no matter how well an operator is able to
maintain a schedule, a passenger who uses public transit or 
a particular line infrequently, or a passenger from outside
of the area in which the particular transit vehicle
operates, is unlikely to have a schedule readily available.A passenger waiting at a transit stop for a transit vehicle
cannot know for certain when the next vehicle will arrive at
the stop. If a passenger arrives at the stop only a minute
or so before a scheduled arrival time, and the next vehicle
does not arrive at that time, the passenger may be uncertain
as to whether or not the vehicle may have arrived and
departed before he or she reached the stop, or if the
vehicle will ever arrive. Such uncertainty, can, of course,
be reduced by arriving sufficiently early at the stop to
avoid missing a vehicle. This, however, consumes time,
which essentially extends the duration of what may already
be a long journey, and which might be better spent by the
passenger in other more enjoyable and/or more productive
activities.Public transit passengers could make use of wasted waiting
time and associated passenger stress could be reduced if a
public transit vehicle arrival information system were
available. Such a predictor would eliminate much of the
stress related to public transit use. With such a
predictor, waiting time could be used for more useful
purposes, such as an

<CLAIMS>
A system (10) for notifying an individual of the status
of a public transport vehicle (12) travelling a

predetermined route, the system (10) comprising a global
positioning determining device (14) located in the

vehicle (12) for determining the location of the vehicle
(12) along the route,

processing means (22) in communication with the global
positioning determining device (14) for receiving the

location of the vehicle (12) therefrom, the processing
means (22) having access to electronically stored

information concerning the route, the information
including the location of each of a plurality of stops

(20) and schedule information and transit times
in the form of a transit data table including the predicted arrival times of the vehicles (12)

at different stops (20) associated with different conditions along the route; for
example a history thereof,

and the processing means (22) including means for
computing from the location of the vehicle (12) and the

electronically stored information a transit time
therefrom including the arrival of the vehicle (12) at

stops (20) along the vehicle's route; the system being

characterised by

means (40, 56) for determining the number of unoccupied
seats in the vehicle (12) and wherein the processing means (22) is in

communication with the means (40, 56) for determining
the number of unoccupied seats therefrom and wherein the

processing means (22) has the capability to determine
the predicted passenger load from the data stored in the

processing means (22) and add the predicted passenger
load to the transit data table.
A system (10) as claimed in claim 1, further comprising
display means (30), in wireless communication with the

processing means (22), for receiving the computed
arrival time therefrom and for displaying the transit

data table or a subset thereof.
