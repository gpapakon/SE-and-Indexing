<ABSTRACT>
A tubular sheath is disclosed which is slidably disposed over a tubular medical device which tubular medical device is positioned at a body tissue access site. The sheath is deposited within a patient to assist in sealing the incision caused by the tubular medical device and inhibit internal and external bleeding. The sheath includes a generally rigid outer coating and an absorbable and expandable inner core, which when positioned, in situ, at the accessed opening of the patient's body part can function as a vascular plug.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a device for use
with or in combination with a wide range of medical instruments
which device is left in situ within the patient, after
and/or during use of the medical instrument, for purposes of
avoiding or preventing hemorrhagic complications arising
from the wound caused by the instrument.The invention is particularly applicable to a
cardiovascular device and process in the general form of a
hollow tubular sheath deposited in the patient's tissue area
to inhibit bleeding and seal or plug the access site and
will be described with particular reference thereto. However,
it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that
the invention has broader medical applications and is not to
be limited to its use as a cardiovascular plug.My prior applications identified above, and specifically
my prior United States Patents 4,838,280 dated June 13,
1989, and 4,936,835 dated June 26, 1990 are incorporated by
reference herein and made a part hereof so that the specifications
hereof need not describe the invention to that detailed
extent which the invention would otherwise be described.
In addition, U.S. Patents 3,358,684 dated December 
19, 1967, and 3,106,483 dated October 8, 1963 are also incorporated by reference
herein so that the specifications need not disclose
in detail information known in the art.There are numerous medical procedures and devices in
use today in which a medical device, generally tubular, such
as a laparoscope, trocar, electrode, probe, introducer, or
the like is inserted into the abdomen, chest, or body parts
of a patient for performing some procedure or inspection
after which the device is withdrawn. When the device is
inserted, a wound results and hemorrhagic complications
arise during the insertion and/or removal of the device.
Until my invention, there was no known device which addressed
the hemorrhagic complications arising from the
wound. If complications arose, the wound was treated in
accordance with sound medical practice employing conventional
techniques.Within the prior art, the use of gelatin as a substance
for making medication capsules for internal use and adapted
to be absorbed by enzyme action or other physiological processes
within the body is well known. Also, the use of gelatin
material for various surgical techniques has been well
documented. In particular, the use of a gelatin material in
a "sponge" form or as a foam is commercially available from
the Upjohn Company under the trademark "Gelfoam". Gelfoam

<CLAIMS>
A medical device for use in a human patient to minimise
bleeding, comprising a tubular member (14) extending along a

path to a site within said patient whereat bleeding is
likely to occur; a hemostatic sheath (36) having a central,

longitudinally extending passageway (89) receiving,
generally concentrically, said tubular member (14) and

slidably disposed about said tubular member (14) and means
(75) for depositing said sheath (36) at said site and for

causing relative sliding motion between said sheath (36) and
said tubular member (14), characterised in that the sheath

(36) has an outer shell (83) and an inner core (84), whereby
the outer (83) shell is an outer casing or coating being

relatively rigid in its initial state and becoming slippery
when in contact with body fluids, whereby the inner core

(84) is of a material being absorbent, expandable and in a
less rigid state than the outer shell (83) and whereby body

fluid at the site causes dimensionally swelling of said
inner core (84) of said hemostatic sheath (36) to such

extent that said body is plugged at the site.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the inner
core (84) and/or the outer shell (83) of the sheath (36) is

made of a material defined in a class comprising collagen,
gelatine, absorbable polymers and combinations thereof.
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the inner
core (84) of the sheath is bioabsorbable. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the inner
core (84) of the sheath is non-absorbable.
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the inner
core (84) material of the sheath is collagen.
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the outer
shell (83) of the sheath (36) is bioabsorbable.
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the outer
shell (83) is made of gelatin.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer

shell (83) is non-absorbable.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer
shell (83) is partially bioabsorbable.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer
shell (83) is sized to a dimension depending on where sheath

(36) is being applied in the body.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
inner core (84) of the sheath (36) is compressed by the

outer shell (83).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
sheath (36) includes thrombin.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
sheath (36) has a longitudinally extending slit (90) along

its length.
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 13, characterised
in that the sheath (36b) has a proximal end portion and a

distal end portion (95), the distal end portion (95) being
radially deformable. 
Device according to claim 14, characterised in that the
deformable distal end portion (95) extends beyond the outer

shell (83).
Device according to claim 15, characterised in that the
deformable distal end portion (95) is composed of a soft,

sticky substance and coated with a very thin bioabsorbable
shell.
Device according to claim 1, the sheath (36) having a
longitudinally-extending distal portion and a

longitudinally-extending proximal portion, characterised in
that the distal portion is softer than the proximal portion.
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 17, characterised
in that said means for depositing is a pusher mechanism

associated with the device or a pushing device.
