<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention concerns (Bacillus thuringiensis) isolates designated (B.t.) PS157C1, (B.t.) PS86A1, and (B.t.) PS75J1, which are active against aphid pests. Thus, these isolates, or variants thereof, can be used to control such pests. Further, genes encoding novel (delta)-endotoxins can be removed from these isolates and transferreed to other host microbes, or plants. Expression of the (delta)-endotoxins in microbe hosts results in the control of aphid pests, whereas transformed plants become resistant to aphid pests.

<DESCRIPTION>
The spore-forming microorganism Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) produces the best-known
insect toxin. The toxin is a protein, designated as Î´-endotoxin. It is synthesized by the B.t.
sporulating cell. The toxin, upon being ingested in its crystalline form by susceptible insect larvae,
is transformed into biologically active moieties by the insect gut juice proteases. The primary
target is insect cells of the gut epithelium, which are rapidly destroyed. Experience has shown that
the activity of the B.t. toxin is so high that only nanogram amounts are required to kill susceptible
insects.The reported activity spectrum of B.t. covers insect species within the order Lepidoptera,
which is a major insect problem in agriculture and forestry. The activity spectrum also includes
the insect order Diptera, wherein reside mosquitoes and blackflies. See de Barjac, H. ([1990] In
H. de Barjac, DJ. Sutherland (eds.) Bacterial Control of Mosquitoes and Blackflies, Rutgers
University Press, Chapter 2). U.S. Patent Nos. 4,771,131 and 4,996,155 disclose toxin genes which
are active against beetles of the order Coleoptera. Activity has also been reported outside the
class Insecta. B.t. strains having activity against nematodes were disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,948,734. European patents EP-A-303 379 and EP-A-462 721 disclose
B.t. toxins active against nematudes and coleopteran or lepidopteran pests.Aphids (Order Hemiptera, Family Aphididae) are sucking insects that are damaging to
many economically important plants. Plant damage occurs when aphids infest plants in high
numbers. Because aphids can reproduce by parthenogenesis, aphid populations have the potential
to increase rapidly. High numbers of aphids can contribute to fungal infestations. In addition to
the damage caused by aphid feeding, aphids can vector many viral diseases of plants.Economically important aphids include the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), pea aphid
(Acyrthosiphon pisum), cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), and
black bean aphid (Aphis fabae).The subject invention concerns Bacillus thuringiensis isolates which have aphidicidal
properties. More specifically, the subject invention concerns the use of Bacillus thuringiensis
isolates designated B.t. PS157C1 (also known as B.t. MT104), B.t. PS86A1, and B.t. PS75J1 to
control aphids in the environment.The aphidicidal use of the B.t. isolates of the invention is shown herein, by way of
example, by their activity against the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Thus, these
