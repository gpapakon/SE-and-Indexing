<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DNA fragment 
encoding an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction in which 
NADH is oxidized by oxygen molecules to generate hydrogen 
peroxide (Japanese Laid-Open Publication 2-407889) and a 
method for preparing the enzyme with the use of a 
microorganism including a plasmid containing the fragment. 
The enzyme is useful for detection of a very small amount 
of substance in vivo with the use of the reaction 
generating NADH. NADH oxidases are divided into two groups, one 
group which generates hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen 
peroxide-generating enzymes) and the other group which 
generates water (water-generating enzymes) by the reaction 
with oxygen molecules. Hydrogen peroxide-generating enzymes can be found 
in a culture of Streptococus mutans. However, it is 
difficult to obtain a stable culture condition in which 
water-generating enzymes can be obtained in a much higher 
level than the level of hydrogen peroxide-generating  
 
enzymes, which can also be found in the culture. Moreover, 
it is necessary to separate hydrogen peroxide generating 
enzymes from water-generating enzymes in the culture. 
Therefore, a method for preparing a large amount of 
hydrogen peroxide-generating NADH oxidases stably in a 
rational way, i.e., a method for preparing NADH oxidases 
with the use of gene recombinant techniques is desired. The conventional method for preparing NADH 
oxidases with a culture of Streptococus mutans is not 
suitable for obtaining a large amount of a hydrogen 
peroxide-generating NADH oxidase. Therefore, one of the 
objectives of the present invention is to provide a gene 
encoding a NADH oxidase, which can be used in a method for 
preparing a large amount of a hydrogen peroxide-generating 
NADH oxidase by gene recombinant techniques. As the result of our researches to develop a 
method for preparing a hydrogen peroxide-generating NADH 
oxidase, we have eventually cloned a gene encoding hydrogen 
peroxide-generating NADH oxidase derived from Streptococus 
mutans and sequenced the gene. The present invention, provides a DNA fragment 
encoding the hydrogen peroxide-generating NADH oxidase. The present invention also provides a DNA 
fragment that encodes a protein containing a NADH binding  
 
site of the NADH oxidase having the following amino acid 
sequence:
