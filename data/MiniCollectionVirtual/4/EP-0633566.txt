<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disc, an
apparatus for reproducing the same and a method of recording
and reproducing the same.There is an optical disc for recording and
reproducing audio information and video information. The
principle of recording and reproducing operation of such an
optical disc is explained with referring to FIG. 11.In FIG. 11, upon recording audio information and/or
video information onto an optical disc 92, the information is
converted to a pit length and an inter space between
information pits 91 on an information recording surface 95 of
the optical disc 92, to be recorded. On the other hand, upon
reproducing the audio and/or video information from the
optical disc 92, a laser beam having a laser beam spot LS with
a predetermined diameter is irradiated onto the information
pits 91, and the reflected and diffracted light is detected by
a light detecting device composed of a photodiode etc., to
convert it to an electrical signal. Then, a signal conversion
reverse to that applied at the time of recording is applied to
the electrical signal and the audio and/or video information 
is reproduced.As an optical disc used in this manner, there are a
compact disc (CD), a laser vision disc (LVD) and so on. In FIG.
11, a reference numeral 93 represents a substrate composed of
polycarbonate resin etc., and a reference numeral 94
represents a protection layer.The information recording density of this kind of
optical disc, is greatly influenced by the value of a track
pitch P1 shown in FIG. 12, and the value of the diameter of the
laser beam spot LS. In order to record more information on an
optical disc, it may be tried to reduce the track pitch or
reduce the diameter of the laser beam spot LS. However, a
practically successful result of such a trail is not reported,
so far.As mentioned above, since it is rather difficult to
increase the information recording density by reducing the
track pitch or reducing the laser beam spot, it may be proposed
a method to increase the information recording density by
irradiating a laser beam onto a pit which has a plurality of
different shapes, and reading the distribution of the
reflected and diffracted light from the pit by a photodetector.
This method aims at increasing the information recording
density by increasing the information amount per one pit, from
one bit (i.e. the presence and absence of the pit) to n bits.
JP-A-2 267 333 discloses a disc according to the preamble of claim 1. The
pit pieces are disposed within a shape of a letter X
