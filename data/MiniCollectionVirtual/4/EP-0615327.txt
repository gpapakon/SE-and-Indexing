<ABSTRACT>
A circuit breaker 1 responds to sputtering arc 
faults 15 by counting the times that a bandwidth limited 

di/dt signal exceeds a threshold magnitude within a selected 
time interval. In the exemplary circuit breaker, if the 

threshold is exceeded twice within a one second interval, 
a trip solenoid 41 is energized. The di/dt sensor 23 can 

share a sensing coil 21 with a ground fault detector. 
Alternatively, the resistance of the neutral lead within 

the circuit breaker is utilized to sense current which is 
converted to a bandwidth limited di/dt signal for level 

detection and counting of sputtering arc events.

<DESCRIPTION>
Commonly owned United States Patent Application 
Serial No. 765,759 entitled ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT BREAKER WITH 
PROTECTION AGAINST SPUTTERING ARC VAULTS AND GROUND FAULTS 
filed on September 26, 1991 in the names of Raymond W. 
Mackenzie and Joseph C. Engel. This invention relates to circuit breakers which 
respond to sputtering arc faults as well as bolted line-to-neutral 
and ground faults and, more particularly, to 
such a circuit breaker which discriminates between sputtering 
arc faults and in-rush currents generated by connecting 
certain loads to the protected conductors. Conventional residential circuit breakers have a 
thermal trip device which responds to persistent over-currents 
of moderate magnitude to provide a delayed trip, 
and a magnetic trip device which responds instantaneously 
to overcurrents of large magnitude. Thus, the fault 
current must reach a predetermined magnitude, for example 
ten times rated current for the instantaneous trip to 
occur, or the overcurrent must sustain a predetermined 
average value over a given time interval to implement the 
delayed trip. There is a type of fault, however, which may 
not produce either the peak magnitude required for the 
instantaneous magnetic trip or the sustained average 
overcurrent necessary for the delayed trip, yet may pose a 
fire hazard. This is the intermittent or sputtering 
arc-type of fault. Such a fault can occur, for instance, 
between two conductors that are in close proximity, but not  
 
touching so that an arc is struck between the conductors. 
This arc can produce a temperature high enough to melt the 
copper in the conductor. The melted droplets of copper can 
ignite flammable material in the vicinity. The resistance 
of the wire may be high enough to limit the peak current 
and the ac current cyclically passes through zero to 
extinguish the arc so that the average current is low. 
Thus, the conventional circuit breaker does not respond to 
the fault, although a hazard exists. This is especially 
true in the case of a stranded wire extension cord where an 
individual strand can be melted at a relatively low fault 
current. As sufficient voltage is required to strike the 
arc of a sputtering arc fault, this type of fault typically 
occurs near the peak of the ac voltage waveform thereby 
resulting in a step increase in current. The above cross-referenced patent application 
discloses a circuit breaker which takes advantage of this 
difference between the sinusoidal wave form of a line-to-neutral 
fault and the step
