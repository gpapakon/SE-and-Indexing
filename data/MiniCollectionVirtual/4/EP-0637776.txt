<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive 
resin composition from which a film excellent 
in smoothness and free from pin holes can be easily 
formed on a support such as a silicon wafer by spin 
coating or the like, and which is excellent in shelf 
stability and viscosity stability of varnish and high in 
sensitivity, and to a method for producing relief 
patterns using the composition. Hitherto, polyimides which are excellent in 
heat resistance and are superior in electrical insulation 
properties and mechanical strength have been used 
for surface protective films and layer insulation films 
of semiconductor devices. However, recently a technique 
to impart photosensitivity to the polyimides per se has 
been noticed for simplification of the complicated steps 
for production of polyimide relief patterns. For example, polyimide precursor compositions 
in which a photosensitive group is given through an 
ester group, and which have the structure represented by 
the following formula are known (Japanese Patent Kokoku  
 
No.55-41422). 
These are dissolved in suitable organic 
solvents, the resulting solutions are coated in the 
state of varnish and dried, then the coated film is 
irradiated with ultraviolet rays through a photo mask, 
developed and rinsed to obtain the desired pattern and 
the pattern is further heat treated to obtain a 
polyimide relief pattern. When polyimides with photosensitivity given 
are used, not only the effect to simplify the steps of 
pattern formation is obtained, but also use of them is 
safe and hardly causes environmental pollution because 
it is not necessary to use highly toxic etching liquids. 
Therefore, it is expected that the technique to photosensitize 
polyimides becomes further important. However, when such conventional photosensitizing 
techniques are applied, photosensitive polyimide 
resin compositions with a photosensitive group introduced 
through an ester group have the problems that they 
are low in viscosity stability at room temperature and  
 
that cissings or pin holes are apt to occur when they 
are coated on silicon wafers which are applied to 
semiconductors or the like. Furthermore, polyimide 
precursors having such ester group, when dissolved in 
solvents, greatly change in viscosity in the state of 
varnish. Therefore, it has been proposed to add various 
inhibitors in order to stabilize viscosity or to use 
mixed solvents or various surface smoothing agents in 
order to improve coatability. Furthermore, it has been 
attempted to add
