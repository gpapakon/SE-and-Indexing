<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to optical elements with imaging, colour- and polarisation-selective reflection, containing cholesteric liquid crystals, and to the manufacture and use of these elements. The optically imaging, wavelength- and polarisation-selective elements are characterised by the fact that at least one cholesteric liquid crystal is enclosed in the intermediate space of constant thickness between two light-transmitting substrates with curved surface such that the helical axis of the liquid crystal is aligned perpendicularly to the curved surface of the light-transmitting substrates. The elements are suitable for use as beam splitters or recombinators in projection displays.

<CLAIMS>
Element which forms an optical image, having at 
least one cholesteric liquid crystal layer (3) which has 

wavelength- and polarization-selective reflection and is 
enclosed in the cavity of constant thickness between two 

light-transmitting substrates (12) having curved surfaces 
in such a way that the helix axis of the liquid crystal 

is aligned perpendicular to the curved surface of the 
light-transmitting substrates the surface being curved in 

such a way that the reflection at the liquid crystal 
layer produces an optical image. 
Element according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cholesteric liquid crystal employed is at least 

one polyorganosiloxane. 
Element according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the light-transmitting substrate having curved 

surfaces is the concave side of a first cylindrical lens 
combined with the convex side of a second cylindrical 

lens in such a way that the element is in the form of a 
cylinder segment. 
Element according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the light-transmitting substrate having curved 

surfaces is the concave side of a first lens combined 
with the convex side of a second lens in such a way that 

the reflector is in the form of a concave mirror. 
Optical element, characterized in that a 
plurality of elements according to one or more of Claims 

1 to 4 are combined on a substrate. 
Polarizing, colour-selective beam splitter 
containing at least one optical element according to one 

or more of Claims 1 to 5. 
Polarizing, colour-selective recombiner containing 
at least one optical element according to one or more 

of Claims 1 to 6. 
Projection display containing at least one 
optical element according to one or more of Claims 1 to 

7. 
Process for the production of optical elements 
according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, characterized  

 
in that at least one cholesteric liquid crystal is 

introduced into the cavity of constant thickness between 
two curved surfaces of light-transmitting substrates, and 

the liquid-crystalline substance is aligned in a manner 
known per se. 
Process for the production of optical elements 
according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 

in that at least one cholesteric liquid crystal, warmed 
if desired, is applied to the curved surface, warmed if 

desired, of a light-transmitting substrate, if desired 
after application of an alignment layer, and this cholesteric 

liquid crystal is subsequently distributed by 
applying a second, curved surface, warmed if desired, of 

a light-transmitting substrate to which an alignment 
layer has, if desired, likewise been applied, in such a 

way that a thin CLC film of constant thickness is formed 
between the curved surfaces of the two light-transmitting 

substrates.
