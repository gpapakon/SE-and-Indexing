<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to continuous ink jet 
printing and, more particularly to such printing when 
applied to the printing of bar codes such as those used in 
retailing or by postal authorities. Continuous ink jet printers are widely used for 
industrial coding and marking applications. A jet of ink 
is broken into a regular stream of uniform ink droplets 
which is then passed through a transverse electric field 
provided across a pair of deflector plates. In general 
droplets are not charged and are caught in a gutter to be 
recycled. If a droplet is charged, it is deflected from 
the recycling path by the electric field and is printed. 
Since the field across the deflector plates is constant, 
the deflection is proportional to the magnitude of the 
charge. The object or substrate being printed is generally 
moved at right angles to the deflection direction and this, 
together with deflection of droplets by varying amounts, 
provides the means for placing droplets at the desired 
position in a two dimensional array. There are aerodynamic and electrostatic interactions 
between closely spaced droplets in flight and these lead to 
distortion of the printed image. At low speed printing, 
only occasional droplets will be charged (since the 
droplets are generated at the same speed regardless of the 
speed of printing and the characters or symbols being 
produced) and there is no problem. With high speed 
printing, however, as many droplets as possible must be 
printed. A common raster, or sequence of printable (but 
not necessarily printed) and non-printable (uncharged) 
droplets (known as guard droplets), is used to print each 
stroke of a line of print, in order to provide an 
acceptable linear response. Since equal spacing is 
required between strokes of printed droplets on the 
substrate, each stroke of print is produced by the same 
number and sequence of printable and non-printable  
 
droplets, but the actual printable droplets which are 
printed will vary from stroke to stroke. The linearity of 
the strokes is particularly important when bar codes are 
being printed. Various techniques are already known for 
optimising the placement of droplets by using carefully 
designed rasters in which a predefined sequence of charged 
and non-charged droplets is used for each stroke. See for 
example EP-A-0206614. For printing the lines of droplets required in bar 
codes for instance, table 1 shows an interleaved raster in 
which sequential droplets numbered 1 to 9 are printed in 
interleaved droplet

<CLAIMS>
A method of high speed printing of bar codes with a 
continuous ink jet printer, in which bars of varying length 

or in varied positions are printed by using a different 
raster of drops for each bar or at least for different bars 

and by switching rasters in real time to print the 
appropriate bar, characterised in that
 
   for printing bar codes with a maximum 12 printed drops 

per bar:
 
   a full bar is printed using a raster of 17 

generated drops of which the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 
10th are guard drops which are not printed;
 
   a bar of 8 printed droplets is printed using a 

raster of 17 generated drops of which either the 2nd, 
4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 14th to 17th, or the 1st to 

6th, 8th, 9th and 11th, are guard drops which are not 
printed; and
 
   a bar of 4 printed droplets is printed using a 

raster of 17 generated drops of which the 1st to 6th, 
8th to 10th, and 14th to 17th are guard drops which 

are not printed. 
A continuous ink jet printer for printing bar codes, 
the printer having memory means for containing a raster 

sequence of printable and non-printable drops for a 
plurality of different bars; and means for printing bars of 

a bar code by switching between the stored raster sequences 
between different bars, characterised in that
 
   the printer is adapted for printing bar codes with a 

maximum 12 printed drops per bar,
 
   a full bar being printed using a raster of 17 

generated drops of which the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 
10th are guard drops which are not printed;
 
   a bar of 8 printed droplets being printed using 

a raster of 17 generated drops of which either the 
2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 14th to 17th, or the 1st  

 
to 6th, 8th, 9th and 11th, are guard drops which are 

not printed; and
 
   a bar of 4 printed droplets being printed using 

a raster of 17 generated drops of which the 1st to 
6th, 8th to 10th, and 14th to 17th are guard drops 

which are not printed.
