<ABSTRACT>
In a method of controlling a heating system equipped with a solid-fuel boiler (10), in which boiler (10) water and/or discharge air at a certain useful temperature is/are produced by the combustion of a solid fuel (23), preferably wood, while primary air (14) is supplied and exhaust gas (22) formed, quick and effective control is achieved by the actual value of the exhaust-gas temperature being measured and by the combustion in the solid-fuel boiler (10) being controlled in such a way that a predetermined desired value of the exhaust-gas temperature is reached and maintained.

Method for the control and/or regulation of heating 
facilities equipped with a solid matter boiler (10), 

in which solid matter boiler (10), by the combustion 
of a solid fuel (23), by preference wood, while primary 

air (14) is supplied and while waste gas (22) 
is formed, boiler feed water and/or exhauset air is 

produced at a specific service temperature,
characterized in that
 
the actual value of the waste gas temperature is measures, 

in that the combustion in the solid matter boiler 
(10) is regulated in such a way that a predetermined 

required value of the waste gas temperature is 
reached and maintained, in that, for the regulation 

of the combustion in the solid matter boiler (10), 
the volume of the supplied primary air (14) is changed, 

in that also the actual value of the service 
temperature is measured and in that, in the case of 

continuous downward or upward deviations of the actual 
value of the service temperature from a predetermined 

required value, the required value of the waste 
gas temperature is increased or decreased, respectively. 
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized in that,
 
for the post-combustion of non-combusted fuel gases, 

secondary air (18) is additionally supplied to the 
solid matter boiler (10), in that the oxygen concentration 

in the waste gas (22) is measured and in 
that, in the event of a continual deviation of the 

actual value of the oxygen concentration upwardly or 
downwardly from a predetermined required value, the 

supply of secondary air (18) is increased or decreased, 
respectively.  

 
Method according to either Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that,
 
for starting the solid matter boiler (10), the solid 

fuel (23) is ignited electrically and in that the 
ignition operation is terminated and the combustion 

regulation started when the waste gas temperature 
indicates the existence of an independent combustion. 
Method according to Claim 3,
characterized in that
 
the ignition takes place at a preset (programmable) 

time. 
Method according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that,
 
for the storage of the thermal energy generated in 

the solid matter boiler (10), a chargeable buffer 
storage means (29) equipped with at least one temperature 

sensor (37,38) is employed, in that the actual 
temperature in the buffer storage means (29) is 

continuously measured and in that, in accordance with 
the actual temperature, the charging of the buffer 

storage means (29) is controlled and/or the required 
value of the waste gas temperatures adjusted. 
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the room temperature and/or the heating temperature 

is measured and the required value of the service 
temperature is adjusted according to the measured 

temperatures. 
Method according to any of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that,
 
apart from the solid matter boiler (10), at least one 

further boiler, by preference an oil/gas boiler (26)  
 

is employed, in which case the at least two boilers 
are connected to the same chimney (25) and in that 

the operation of the further boiler takes place in 
accordance with the operating state of the solid matter 

boiler (10). 
Method according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the further boiler is turned on only when the measured 

waste gas temperature on the solid matter boiler 
(10) indicates that the solid matter boiler (10) is 

turned off. 
Method according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the position of a filling door (12) on the solid matter 

boiler (10) is monitored and in that the further 
boiler is turned off when the measured waste gas temperature 

on the solid matter boiler (10) exceeds a 
predetermined value and/or when it is indicated that 

the filling door (12) is open. 
Method according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the heating circuit is changed over to that one of 

the two boilers which is in operation just then.
