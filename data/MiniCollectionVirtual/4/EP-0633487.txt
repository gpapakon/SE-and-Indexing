<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a nose pad of spectacles comprising a hollow body having a 
resilient member fitted therein. The resilient member has a 

joint piece integrally connected thereto, projecting from the 
hollow body. The three-dimensional shape of the resilient member 

is yieldingly deformable in the hollow space of the nose pad 
in response to a force applied to the nose pad. The joint piece 

is changeable in its position in all directions so as to fit itself 
along either side of the nose. The required orientation of each 

nose pad can be automatically caused by deformation of the 
resilient member in response to the counterforce from the nose 

to the nose pad.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in or relating 
to spectacles, particularly the structure of nose pad of spectacles. When wearing spectacles, the spectacles are supported by the end 
pieces of the temples on the ears and by the nose pads on the 
opposite sides of the nose. Recently, spectacles which use 
frames of a relatively light metal such as titanium and lenses 
of a relatively light material other than glass, such as coated 
plastics have been popular. Thanks to use of light materials 
the weight of such spectacles is reduced substantially. The 
weight distribution, however, is biased against the frame, and 
if a person wears such light-weighted spectacles for a long 
time, he is liable to feel somewhat a pain on either side of his 
nose. Also, the spectacles are liable to move down along the nose to 
pull the ears by the temples of the frame, thus causing the person 
to feel a pain in the ears. Still disadvantageously, the 
moving-down of the spectacles along the nose will put the lenses 
in defocussing position, thereby blurring the sight and causing 
an ill effect on his eyesight. The nose pads are pivotally 
fixed by very small screws to the small box-like objects, which 
are soldered to the metal pieces extending from the rims of the 
front frame or from the plastic lenses themselves in case the 
spectacles is frameless type using plastic lenses. Thanks to 
the pivotal fixing of the nose pads and thanks to the loose attaching 
of the very small screws to the small box-like objects 
the nose pads are somewhat movable so as to fit on the opposite 
sides of the nose. People's nose shapes are variant respectively and such pivotal 
fixing of the pads and loose attaching of screws cannot be 
enough to every persons. Accordingly the frame is adjusted personally 
by somewhat bending, thereby permitting the nose pads to  
 
be fitted on the opposite sides of the nose at the cost of undesired 
shift of the spectacles out of position. Assume that 
his body moves quickly particularly in exercise. The nose pads 
may be raised from the nose, allowing the spectacles to move out 
of position because the frame cannot be kept stable in position 
by the raised nose pads. In an attempt to permit the nose pads 
to be fitted on the opposite sides of the nose by bending the 
supporting metals of the nose pads, the soldering may be often 
destroyed, and thereby causing the nose pads to be removed from 
the front. In view of the above one object of the present invention is to 
provide nose pads of

<CLAIMS>
A nose pad of spectacles comprising a hollow body having a 
resilient member fitted therein, three-dimensional shape of said 

resilient member being yieldingly deformable in the hollow space 
of the hollow body, said hollow body having an opening on its 

rear side, and said resilient member having a joint piece 
projecting from said opening. 
A nose pad of spectacles according to claim 1, wherein said 
hollow body has a plurality of small apertures on its front 

side. 
A nose pad for spectacles according to claim 2, wherein 
said hollow body has another opening at lower part of the rear 

surface of the body, thereby facilitating removal of dust from 
said hollow space.
