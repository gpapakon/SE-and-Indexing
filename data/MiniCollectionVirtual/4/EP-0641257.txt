<ABSTRACT>
A catalytic composition comprises a metal hydrogenation-dehydrogenation component supported on a support material comprising an ultra-large pore crystalline material of high surface area and porosity. The crystalline material exhibits unusually large sorption capacity demonstrated by its benzene adsorption capacity of greater than about 15 grams benzene/100 grams at 50 torr and 25  DEG C, and has uniformly sized pores with a maximum perpendicular cross section of at least about 13  ANGSTROM . In a preferred form, the support material, which is preferably a metallosilicate such as an aluminosilicate, has the pores in a hexagonal arrangement, giving rise to a hexagonal electron diffraction pattern that can be indexed with a d100 value greater than about 18  ANGSTROM . The catalytic composition is useful in petroleum refining, e.g. hydrocracking of mineral oil feedstocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydroprocessing
catalyst based on synthetic ultra-large pore size
crystalline materials.This invention relates to catalysts which are
especially useful for hydrocracking and for other
hydroprocessing applications including hydrotreating
and hydrofinishing. They are particularly useful for
the production of high viscosity index lubricants by
hydrocracking mineral oil feedstocks, especially
distillate stocks.Many chemical processes, especially in the
petroleum refining and petrochemical industries utilize
bifunctional catalysts which exhibit both acidic and
hydrogenation-dehydrogenation activity. Catalysts of
this type are frequently used in the processing of
various hydrocarbon fractions in processes where
hydrogen is present either as a feed component or as a
product of the reaction such as hydrogenation,
hydrocracking, hydrotreating, hydrofinishing,
hydrodewaxing (see U.S. Patent No. 3,968,024),
hydrodemetallation, hydroisomerization, reforming and
the like. For the purposes of this application,
processes of this type are referred to as
hydroprocessing applications regardless of whether the
hydrogen is used as a feed component, i.e. a reactant
as in hydrocracking, or is produced in the process as
one of the reaction products as in reforming.
Bifunctional catalysts are utilized in various
petrochemical hydroprocessing applications such as, for
example, xylene isomerization, as described in U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,856,572; 4,101,597 and 4,312,790; toluene
disproportionation as described in U.S. Patent No. 
4,052,476 and other reactions where hydrogen is present
either as a feed component or as a product of the
desired reaction. In many petroleum refining
applications, the metal component is supported on an
amorphous support material such as alumina or
silica-alumina since these materials often have the
requisite pore volumes and the appropriate pore sizes
for the high molecular weight hydrocarbons which may be
encountered in the processing.Hydrocracking is a process which has achieved
widespread use in petroleum refining for converting
various petroleum fractions to lighter and more
valuable products, especially distillates such as jet
fuels, diesel oils and heating oils. Hydrocracking is
generally carried out in conjunction with an initial
hydrotreating step in which the heteroatom-containing
impurities in the feed are hydrogenated without a
significant degree of bulk conversion. During this
initial step, the heteroatoms, principally nitrogen and
sulfur, are converted to inorganic
