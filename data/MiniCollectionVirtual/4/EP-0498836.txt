<DESCRIPTION>
Title: VINYL HALIDE POLYMERS MODIFIED WITH OLEFINIC NITRILE POLYMERSField of the InventionThis invention relates to vinyl halide polymer compositions modified with olefinic nitrile polymers, and more particularly, to vinyl halide polymer composi¬ tions modified with olefinic nitrile polymers and exhi¬ biting reduced gas permeability. The vinyl halide compositions comprise a mixture of at least one vinyl halide polymer and at least one olefinic nitrile poly¬ mer. The invention also relates to films, sheets and hollow articles fabricated from the vinyl halide compo¬ sitions.Background of the InventionPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) compositions are commonly used as packaging materials for cosmetics, phar¬ maceuticals, foods and health car*? products. Polyvinyl chloride is preferentially selected for these packaging applications, due to its low cost, clarity and ease of processing. In some packaging applications it is very desirable that plastic materials exhibit a very high gas impermeability. The gas barrier properties of PVC compo¬ sitions are adequate for some applications but require improvement for the protection of extremely oxygen-sensi¬ tive materials.The gas barrier properties of PVC may be improved by chemical or physical modification, or by the 

addition of a filler or a protective coating. A prefer¬ red approach to improving the gas barrier properties of PVC is by blending with barrier materials. Blends in general do not always have the additive properties of the two components. The properties of the blend in many instances are worse than the properties of the pure components. Therefore, blending a barrier polymer with PVC polymers does not necessarily lead to a composite with improved gas impermeability relative to PVC. This invention describes the blending of olefinic nitrile barrier polymers with vinyl halide polymers to produce a blend whose barrier properties are additive.The olefinic nitrile polymers themselves are used to form films and containers which are character¬ ized as having improved oxygen and carbon dioxide gas barrier properties. These high nitrile compositions are available from a variety of sources and are described in various patents. For example, U.S. Patent 3,974,239 describes impact-resistant polymers which have low per¬ meability to gases and vapors. The polymers are prepar¬ ed by polymerizing an olefinic nitrile such as acrylo- nitrile with an acrylic ester and a conjugated diene which may be either butadiene or isoprene. These compo¬ sitions are reported to be improvements
