<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the printing of textiles, in particular for making a transparent imprint onto transparent fabrics, such as nylon stockings, the following steps are provided:   - the application of the fabric ply to be printed onto a substrate provided with a heat-resistant anti-adhesive coating, - the laying of an offset transfer onto the fabric region to be printed, - the covering of the regions of the fabric which are not to be printed with a heat-insulating layer, - the application of a pressure, directed towards the substrate, at least onto the offset transfer at a temperature of more than 90 DEG C for a duration of at least 5 seconds,   - the relief of at least the printed region of the fabric, and - the removal of the offset transfer and of the heat-insulating layer from the fabric and the removal of the fabric from the substrate.

Method for printing textiles, more especially for producing a transparent
impression on transparent fabrics, such as nylon stockings, characterised by

the following steps:

applying the fabric layer (2) to be printed to a base (6), which is
provided with a heat-resistant non-stick coating (3);
laying an offset transfer (4) on the region of the fabric (2) to be
printed;
covering the regions of the fabric (2), which are not to be printed,
with a heat-suppressing layer (5);
applying a pressure, which is directed towards the base (6), at least to
the offset transfer (4) at a temperature of more than 90o C for a period of at

least 5 seconds;
removing the pressure from at least the printed region of the fabric
(2); and
removing the offset transfer (4) and the heat-suppressing layer (5)
from the fabric and removing the fabric (2) from the base (6).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the base (6) is covered with
a heat-suppressing layer (5) prior to the application of the fabric layer (2), and

this heat-suppressing layer is removed again, together with the printed fabric

(2), after the completion of the printing process. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the fabric (2) is laid
over a base (6), which is adapted to the shape of the textile to be printed, so

that the fabric region to be printed is tensioned.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
offset transfer (4) and the heat-suppressing layer (5) are applied

simultaneously.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
region to be printed is heated to a temperature of between 150o C and 220o C,

preferably to a temperature of 190o C, and is pressurised for a period of
between 5 and 45 seconds.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
textile is printed simultaneously at different locations.
Apparatus for printing textiles, more especially for producing a transparent
impression on transparent fabrics, such as nylon stockings, having a base (6)

to which the fabric (2) to be printed can be applied, and wherein a matching
shape (7), corresponding to the base (6), is provided to generate a pressure,

said matching shape being pivotable against the base (6), the apparatus (1)
being heatable during the printing process, characterised in that the base (6) is

coated with a heat-resistant non-stick layer (3). 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in that the base (6) is coated on
all sides with a heat-resistant non-stick layer (3) in the intended fabric contact

region.
Apparatus according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the matching
shape(s) (7), corresponding to the base (6), is/are coated with a heat-resistant

ant-stick layer (3).
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 - 9, characterised in that the base (6)
is so configured that the fabric layer (2) to be printed can be applied directly

to the non-stick layer (3).
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 10, characterised in that the base (6)
and/or the matching shape(s) (7) are electrically heatable to a constant

temperature.
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 11, characterised in that the
non-stick layer (3) is formed from a plastics material, preferably from

tetrafluoroethylene.
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 12, characterised in that the base (6)
is configured as a plate which is adapted to the shape of the textile to be

printed, so that the latter can be laid, preferably tensioned, over the base (6). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 13, characterised in that two
matching shapes (7), configured to correspond to the base (6), are provided so

that the fabric (2), which is laid onto the base (6), is printable on both sides.
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 14, characterised in that the base
(6), together with the matching shape(s) (7), is pivotable about a horizontal

axis (8) by means of a pivot lever (9), which is preferably configured to be
lockable.
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 15, characterised in that the base (6)
and the matching shape are configured to correspond to each other in respect

of the physical shape of the body part to be clothed with the textile.
