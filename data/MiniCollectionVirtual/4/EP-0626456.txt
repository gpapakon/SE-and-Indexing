<ABSTRACT>
Methods for processing samples which may contain mycobacteria which are 
compatible with both conventional culturing techniques and nucleic acid analysis. It has been 

found that the harsh chemical treatment previously thought necessary to obtain efficient lysis 
can be eliminated without loss of lysis efficiency, thereby eliminating reagents which may 

inhibit subsequent nucleic acid-based reactions. Heat alone is sufficient to lyse mycobacteria, 
even in buffers which do not contain detergents, chelators, enzymes, etc. Residual reagents 

introduced by conventional sample processing methods for culture can be successfully 
removed from the processed pellet without significant loss of microorganisms by at least two 

washings with saline, water, or buffers compatible with nucleic acid analysis and appropriate 
centrifugation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for releasing nucleic acids from
microorganisms. In particular the invention relates to such methods which are compatible
with subsequent manipulations of the nucleic acids, for example nucleic acid amplification.Mycobacterium sp. are conventionally identified by microbiological culture. As these
microorganisms are slow growing and may exist in low numbers in clinical samples, such
culturing techniques are time consuming and may require three to six weeks of culturing
before a result is available. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is the causative agent of
tuberculosis in humans and is currently diagnosed using these conventional culturing
techniques. To prepare for M.tb culture, sputum samples are processed by methods which
have been in use for about thirty years (G. Kubica, et al. 1963. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 87:775-779).
These and other sample processing methods for M.tb culture have been developed for
the purposes of 1) reducing the viscosity of the sputum sample to facilitate handling, 2) killing
contaminating organisms (such as fungi and non-mycobacteria) to prevent co-culturing
with
M. tuberculosis and confusion of the diagnosis, and 3) concentrating the sample into a small
volume for seeding cultures. To accomplish these goals, conventional sample preparation
methods for Mycobacteria sp. have traditionally employed harsh conditions and caustic, toxic
or reactive reagents. Conventional sample processing procedures for mycobacterial culture
are reviewed by G. Kubica in The Mycobacteria: A Source Book. Part A. (Kubica, G. and
Wayne, L. eds.) Marcel Dekker, N.Y. (1984).A commonly used sample processing method for M.tb culture is the N-acetyl-L-cysteine/sodium
hydroxide method. This method uses NaOH, sodium citrate and N-acetyl L-cysteine
(NALC) to digest the sample, with recovery of the mycobacteria by centrifugation.
The pellet is then resuspended in a small volume and used to inoculate the culture medium. 
Similar methods have been developed in which sodium hydroxide is used alone, with
neutralization of the pellet prior to resuspension and culturing. NaOH has also been used with
sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) to process samples for culture, again with neutralization of the
pellet by addition of acid prior to inoculation of the culture medium. The ZEPHIRAN-trisodium
phosphate method for sample processing uses trisodium phosphate and ZEPHIRAN
(benzalkonium chloride) in a similar process.Nucleic acid-based genetic methods for identification of microorganisms have

A method for processing 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 which is compatible with nucleic
acid analysis comprising the steps of:


a) liquifying a sputum sample;
b) centrifuging the liquified sample to form a liquified pellet;
c) washing the liquified pellet at least twice with a wash solution consisting of
saline, water or a buffer which does not contain detergents, enzymes or chelating agents,

and centrifuging between washes at a speed sufficient to form a washed pellet which is
resistant to loss of material during washing, and;
d) resuspending the washed pellet in a solution consisting of saline, water, or a
buffer which does not contain detergents, enzymes or chelating agents and lysing the


Mycobacterium tuberculosis
