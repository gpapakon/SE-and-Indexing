<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions, or mixtures, of fluorinated 
hydrocarbons and more specifically to azeotropic or azeotrope-like compositions 
comprising effective amounts of 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-octofluorobutane and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene 
to form an 
azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition. Such compositions are useful as cleaning 
agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and polyurethanes, refrigerants, aerosol 
propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, 
power cycle working fluids, polymerization media, particulate removal fluids, carrier 
fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and displacement drying agents. Fluorinated hydrocarbons have many uses, one of which is as a 
cleaning agent or solvent to clean, for example, electronic circuit boards. Electronic 
components are soldered to circuit boards by coating the entire circuit side of the 
board with flux and thereafter passing the flux-coated board over preheaters and 
through molten solder. The flux cleans the conductive metal parts and promotes 
solder fusion, but leave residues on the circuit boards that must be removed with a 
cleaning agent. Preferably, cleaning agents should have a low boiling point, 
nonflammability, low toxicity, and high solvency power so that flux and flux-residues 
can be removed without damaging the substrate being cleaned. Further, it is 
desirable that cleaning agents that include a fluorinated hydrocarbon be azeotropic 
or azeotrope-like so that they do not tend to fractionate upon boiling or 
evaporation. If the cleaning agent were not azeotropic or azeotrope-like, the more 
volatile components of the cleaning agent would preferentially evaporate, and the 
cleaning agent could become flammable or could have less-desirable solvency 
properties, such as lower rosin flux solvency and lower inertness toward the 
electrical components being cleaned. The azeotropic property is also desirable in 
vapor degreasing operations because the cleaning agent is generally redistilled and 
reused for final rinse cleaning.  
 Fluorinated hydrocarbons may also be used as refrigerants. In 
refrigeration applications, a refrigerant is often lost during operation through leaks 
in shaft seals, hose connections, solder joints, and broken lines. In addition, the 
refrigerant may be released to the atmosphere during maintenance procedures on 
refrigeration equipment. Accordingly, it is desirable to use a single fluorinated 
hydrocarbon or an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition that includes one
