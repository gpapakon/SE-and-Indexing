<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for controlling the supply of power to 
a variable-speed induction motor (12) converts an AC power 

source (10) voltage to a motor supply voltage at a designated 
frequency, with the amplitude of the motor supply 

voltage being controlled in accordance with the motor 
load such that the degree of slip conforms to a 

predetermined optimum slip charactistic, whereby high 
efficiency and stability are maintained over a wide 

range of load values. The motor supply voltage 
amplitude is detected to provide an indication of the 

motor load, an optimum value of an operating parameter 
of the motor which varies in accordance with degree of 

slip is derived based on the designated frequency and 
the detected voltage amplitude, using a predetermined 

function corresponding to that frequency, and the motor 
supply voltage amplitude is controlled such as to reduce 

an amount of difference between the optimum value of the 
operating parameter and a detected value of that 

parameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an induction motor
power supply control apparatus, and in particular to an
induction motor power supply control apparatus providing
variable-speed operation of an induction motor, together
with a high degree of efficiency and with complete
stability of operation over a wide range of motor load.In the prior art, various proposals have been made
for controlling the power supplied to an induction motor
which must drive varying levels of load, in general by
controlling the operation of a DC-AC power inverter
(hereinafter referred to simply as a power inverter) to
determine the supply voltage of the motor. Among these
are proposals to obtain increased efficiency of
operation of an induction motor by controlling the
supply voltage such that the motor operates with a fixed
value of power factor (typically, approximately 80%),
irrespective of changes in the load imposed on the
motor. However in practice it is found with such a
method that although the operation is satisfactory when 
the motor is driving a high level of load, the power
factor is excessively high when the motor is operating
at an intermediate level of load or light load. That
is to say, with such a method the value of supply
voltage applied to the motor under a condition of
intermediate load or light load is made excessively low,
which can resulting an an excessive degree of motor
slip, an excessive level of motor current, and hence
increased power consumption when operating at an
intermediate level of load. The objective of achieving
increased efficiency is thereby defeated, while in
addition the motor speed will become unstable when the
motor is operating under light load or zero load, and
the motor may stall.Such problems of the prior art become especially
severe in the case of a variable-speed induction motor
which must not only function with efficiency and
stability over a wide range of load values, but also at
a number of different values of supply frequency. An
induction motor control apparatus for controlling a
variable-speed induction motor is described for example
in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 64-50792
whereby respectively different values of optimum power
factor are established for various values of motor
supply frequency. The supply voltage of the induction 
motor is controlled to operate, at any particular value
of drive frequency, fixedly at the power factor that has
been predetermined for that frequency. However for the
reasons described above, such a method cannot provide
high
