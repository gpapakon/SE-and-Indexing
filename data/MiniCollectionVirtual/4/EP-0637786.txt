<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method of continuous execution of NC programs for different types of machining, 
wherein parameter values are automatically changed in accordance with the types of machining such as rough 

machining, medium finish machining, and finish machining, memory in an NC apparatus stores parameters to be 
changed in accordance with the type of machining and their values, and the machining program in such a manner that 

they are associated with their corresponding types of machining. In the beginning of execution of each machining 
program, therefore, its associated type of machining is determined (steps S2 to S5), and the values of the parameters 

for the program are automatically changed in accordance with the type of machining (steps S7 to S9). In this way, a 
machining tool is controlled constantly with optimum parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machining
program execution method for an NC device.There are various machining programs, which are
executed by an NC device, including machining programs
for rough machining, intermediate finish machining,
finish machining, etc. In order to effect machining
control of a machine tool by means of the NC device,
parameters for the feed rate, acceleration/deceleration
control, main spindle control, etc., required for the
drive control of various parts of the machine tool, must
be set previously in the NC device, besides the
machining program.Conventionally, the parameters are initially set
beforehand in the NC device by the manufacturer, in
consideration of the convenience and wishes of a user
who utilizes the NC device or the machine tool. As long
as the values of the parameters are kept fixed, however,
it is hard to meet all of machining conditions,
including rough machining, intermediate finish
machining, finish machining, etc.To cope with this problem, the NC device is
provided with a function for modifying the setting of
the parameters.According to the conventional NC device, after
bringing the NC device to a data input mode or an
emergency stop state, desired parameter values are
inputted by assigning parameter numbers by means of
softkeys or ten-keys of a manual data input device
attached to the NC device, or the parameter values are 
reloaded by setting a parameter tape in a tape reader to
read the desired parameter values. All these operations
are carried out manually, and the NC device is in an
alarm state during these operations, so that the
parameter reloading operation cannot be carried out in
parallel with the execution of the machining programs.In the case of lathing or milling operation, the
machining processings, such as the rough machining,
intermediate finish machining, finish machining, etc.,
can be executed in succession by repeatedly executing
the same machining programs, while program-controlling
the revolution speed, offset, etc. However. as
discussed previously, in the case of conventional NC
device, the parameters can not be reloaded during the
execution of the machining programs. Even during
intervals between individual machining processings, such
as rough machining, intermediate finish machining,
finish machining, etc., the setting of parameter tape
and operation of the manual data input device need to be
done by the operator. Therefore, resetting the
parameters in response to the change of the machining
processing is practically impossible
