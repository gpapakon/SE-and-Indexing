<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a holding device for a winding (1) of a stator (3) of an electric motor having a holding lug (7) which holds the winding overhang (5) together, the position of the holding lug (7) being held by a holding element (11). Binding up the winding overhang (5) is simplified according to the invention in that the holding element (11) has a flexible attachment (9) which forms the holding lug (7) and whose free end (63) has latching means which are arranged one behind the other and can be automatically latched in a positively locking manner to the holding element (11) over threading-in inclined surfaces (65, 67), which form an insertion slot (69), behind latching tabs of two mating latching means which are sprung with respect to one another. This makes it possible to bind up the winding overhang (5) using automatic machines.
