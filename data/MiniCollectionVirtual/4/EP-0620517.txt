<ABSTRACT>
A graphical user interface is changed according to a new font for 
one object in the graphical user interface. The set of appearance 

parameters are adjusted for the object according to the new font and 
presenting the object according to the adjusted appearance parameters and 

the new font. A set of related objects within the interface can also be 
changed according to the new font. Once the new font is established for 

the object, the set of related objects in the graphical user interface 
for the object is determined. Then, each respective set of appearance 

parameters for the set of related objects is adjusted according to its 
object class and the set of related objects is presented according to 

their respective appearance parameters and the new font.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a graphical user interface to 
control a computer system. More particularly, it relates to changing 
appropriate objects within the graphical user interface in response to a 
request to change a font on one of the objects. It is well known to provide a graphical user interface to allow a 
user to control a computer system and to present the results of user 
actions on the system display. In a graphical user interface, 
applications and data files are generally presented within windows. Each 
window typically has a number of elements which are associated with the 
window and are presented in the display space allocated to the window. 
The window and each of its separate elements are generally structured and 
stored in memory as objects which are related logically. The elements of 
the window are generally child objects of the main window object (for 
example the individual screen elements representing specific processes 
created solely for a specific 'parent' process). In newer graphical user interfaces, it is possible for a user to 
select the font by which the information is displayed if the standard 
font is not pleasing to the user. Typically, after the selection of the 
new font, the window is refreshed to display the new font, but is not 
changed in any other way. If the font was a larger font, it is often 
clipped or unreadable due to the element within the graphical user 
interface being too small to display it properly. If a smaller font was 
selected, then the window display space is wasted. Furthermore, the GUI 
looks awkward and malproportioned. Further, when a font is selected for 
one object in the graphical user interface, the font is typically changed 
only for the immediate object. When that object is a child object of the 
main window or another parent object within the window, sibling objects 
of the object receiving the font will not receive the new font even when 
it makes sense that they should. The present invention provides a system and a method for changing a 
graphical user interface according to a user selection of a new display 
font, the system comprising:
 
 
   means responsive to a user input for changing a font for a first 
object of a first object class displayed in the graphical user interface 
to a new font;
 
   means for automatically adjusting a set of size and position 
parameters for the first object according to the new font and the first 
object class; and
 
   means for presenting the first object according to the adjusted 
si

<CLAIMS>
A method for changing a graphical user interface display according 
to a user selection of a new display font, comprising the steps of: 

   in response to a user input, changing a font for a first object of 
a first object class in the graphical user interface to a new font; 

   automatically adjusting size and position parameters for the first 
object according to the font change and the first object class; and 

   presenting the first object according to the adjusted size and 
position parameters and the changed font. 
A method according to claim 1 which further comprises the steps of: 
   determining a set of related objects in the graphical user 

interface for the first object; 

   automatically adjusting size and position parameters for each 
object of the set of related objects; and 

   presenting the set of related objects according to their respective 
size and position parameters and the changed font. 
A method according to claim 2 wherein the size and position 
parameters for each object of the set of related objects are adjusted 

according to the object class of the respective object. 
A method according to claim 3, wherein object size parameters are 
made font-specific when an object is created, with reference to a non-font-specific 

object class definition, for all classes of object which 
can be affected by font changes, thereby to facilitate adjustment of size 

parameters when a new font is selected. 
A method according to any one of claims 2 to 4 wherein the 
determining step is accomplished by determining a set of child objects of 

a parent object for the first object, the set of child objects being the 
set of related objects. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims which further 
comprises the steps of: 

   determining a set of windows which belong to a first process which 
owns the first object; and 

   adjusting size and position parameters for corresponding sets of 
related objects within each of the set of windows. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
step of changing a font comprises the steps of: 

   grabbing and dragging a new font from a font palette in the 
graphical user interface; and 

   dropping the new selected font over the object. 
A system for changing a graphical user interface display following 
user selection of a new display font, comprising: 

   means responsive to a user input for changing a font for a first 
object of a first object class displayed in the graphical user interface 

to a new font; 
   means for automatically adjusting a set of size and position 

parameters for the first object according to the new font and the first 
object class; and 

   means for presenting the first object according to the adjusted 
size and position parameters and the new font. 
A system according to claim 8 which further comprises: 
   means for determining a set of related objects in the graphical 

user interface for the first object; 
   means for adjusting each respective set of size and position 

parameters for each object of the set of related objects; and 
   means for presenting the set of related objects according to their 

respective size and position parameters and the new font. 
A system according to claim 9 wherein the size and position 
parameters for each object of the set of related objects are adjusted 

according to the object class of the respective object. 
A system according to claim 10, having means for storing non-font-specific 
size definitions for each class of object which can be affected 

by font changes, to facilitate adjustment when a new font is selected of 
font-specific object size parameters. 
A system according to any one of claims 9 to 11, wherein the means 
for determining includes means for determining a set of child objects of 

a parent object for the first object, the set of child objects being the 
set of related objects. 
A system according to any one of claims 8 to 12 which further 
comprises: 

   means for determining a set of windows which belong to a first 
process which owns the first object; and 

   means for adjusting size and position parameters for corresponding 
sets of related objects within each of the set of windows. 
A system according to any one of claims 8 to 13 wherein the means 
for changing a font comprises: 

   means for grabbing and dragging a new font from a font palette in 
the graphical user interface; and 

   means for dropping the new selected font over the first object.
