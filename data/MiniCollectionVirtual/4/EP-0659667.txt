<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a sheet feeding 
apparatus (6) for feeding a sheet bundle having different 

thickness, comprising a rotatable belt convey member (63), 
and a sponge roller (61) arranged in an opposed relation to 

the rotatable belt convey member. Preferably, the 
sheet feeding apparatus further comprises a shaft-to-shaft 

spacer means (65) for ensuring a minimum shaft-to-shaft 
distance between the rotatable belt convey member 

and the sponge roller, and a pressurizing means (66) for 
urging the sponge roller and the rotatable belt convey 

member against each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet feeding
apparatus and a sheet sorting apparatus having such a
sheet feeding apparatus, and more particularly, it
relates to a sheet sorting apparatus which is connected
to a copying machine having a reading apparatus, a
facsimile machine (communication system), a printer
connected to a computer, and a binding apparatus
(stapler, glueing apparatus) to sort sheets or sheet
bundles.A sheet feeding apparatus comprising the features of the
pre-characterizing clause of claim 1 and a sheet sorting
apparatus comprising the features of the pre-characterizing
clause of claim 5 are known.In this conventional sheet or sheet bundle
feeding apparatus incorporated into the conventional sheet sorting
apparatus, a thickness of
a sheet bundle being fed is detected, and an upper
roller is separated from a lower roller in accordance
with the detected thickness so that the sheet bundle
can be conveyed by the pair of upper and lower rollers.However, in the above conventional case, since
the thickness of the sheet bundle being fed must be
detected and the upper roller must be separated from
the lower roller in accordance with the detected
thickness, the apparatus becomes very complex 
and expensive.Document US-A-46 96 392 discloses a feeding apparatus for feeding
corrugated box blanks. This known feeding apparatus comprises
a modified four-bar-linkage system which includes two
linkage arms, a frame and a bar linked to the frame by means of
the linkage arms. Four rollers are mounted on the bar. These
rollers are sponge rollers. A movable convey belt member is disposed
below the four-bar-linkage system. A pressurizing means
urges the sponge rollers downwardly against the convey belt member.
A stop maintains the bar and thus the rollers at a predetermined
height above the convey belt member or in frictional
contact therewith.Document EP-A-0288881 discloses a feeding apparatus for feeding
single sheets. This known sheet feeding apparatus comprises two
cooperative rollers and a pressurizing means formed by leaf
springs for urging the two rollers against each other.The present invention aims at eliminating the above-mentioned
drawbacks of the conventional sheet feeding apparatus for feeding
sheet bundles and of the conventional sheet sorting apparatus.
Therefore, the object underlying the invention consists in
providing a sheet feeding apparatus which can reliably feed
sheet bundles of differing thicknesses and which is nevertheless
simple in construction and inexpensive. Moreover, it is an
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sheet feeding apparatus for feeding sheet
bundles of differing thicknesses, comprising


a first roller (61) and
a second roller (64, 64a), said first and second
rollers (61; 64, 64a) being arranged so as to confront each

other,
characterized in that
said first roller is a sponge roller (61),
in that a movable convey belt member (63) is
supported by and wound around a plurality of rollers (64,

64a, 64b) including said second roller (64, 64a),
in that said movable convey belt member (63) is
interposed between said sponge roller (61) and said second

roller (64, 64a) confronting said sponge roller (61) for
conveying a sheet bundle into and through a nip formed

between said convey belt member (63) and said sponge roller
(61),
in that a spacer means (65) is provided which engages
a shaft (69) of said sponge roller (61) and a shaft (68,

68b) of said second roller (64, 64a) confronting said
sponge roller (61) for ensuring a minimum shaft-to-shaft

distance between said two shafts (69; 68, 68b), and
in that a pressurizing means (66) urges said sponge
roller (61) and said convey belt member (63) against each

other.
A sheet feeding apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein, when a sheet bundle having a thickness greater

than a predetermined value approaches said nip, the
conveying speed at which the convey belt member (63)

conveys said sheet bundle is reduced. 
A sheet feeding apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein said sponge roller (61) is sandwiched by

flanges (62) having diameters smaller than the diameter of
said sponge roller (61). 
A sheet feeding apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein, when a diameter of said sponge

roller (61) is D and a distance between an upper and a lower
surface of said convey belt member (63) is d, the minimum

shaft-to-shaft distance ensured by said spacer means (65) is
set to be (
(D+d)/2-1 mm
) or less.
A sheet sorting apparatus comprising:

a sheet inlet portion (3);
a containing portion (4) arranged downstream of said
sheet inlet portion (3) and having a plurality of trays (4a to 4j); and
a lift/lower convey body (6) arranged between said
sheet inlet portion (3) and said containing portion (4) to be

lifted and lowered for conveying a received sheet to a
designated tray (4a to 4j);
wherein a sheet feeding apparatus according to
any one of claims 1 to 4 is used in said lift/lower

convey body (6).
A sheet sorting apparatus according to
claim 5, wherein four or more sponge rollers (61,61a) are

provided on a side of said lift/lower convey body (6) near
said containing portion (4), and wherein two or more of these sponge

rollers (61,61a) have diameters smaller than those of the other
sponge rollers (61).
A sheet sorting apparatus according to 
claim 6, wherein said sponge rollers (61,61a) are arranged at

an upstream side and a downstream side of said convey belt member (63), and wherein the
downstream side sponge rollers (61,61a) are designed so that

the sheet can be discharged upwardly.
