<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the exposure
control of an image pickup apparatus provided with electronic
image magnification enlarging means for electronically
enlarging the image magnification of a subject.In recent years, the evolution of video apparatus,
such as video cameras, is remarkable, and various functions,
such as an automatic exposure control function, an automatic
focus control function and a large-magnification zoom
function, are incorporated in a single video apparatus as
standard functions.In addition, recently, the function of
electronically enlarging the image magnification of a subject
by intermittently reading out a signal from an image pickup
element and performing interpolation on the read-out signal,
i.e., so-called electronic zoom, has been introduced, so that
a far larger zoom magnification is realized and the functions
and operability of the video apparatus are improved to a
further extent.However, an exposure control system which is
generally used in a video camera or the like is arranged to
control an iris so that the luminance level of a video signal
output from an image pickup element can be kept constant
at a predetermined level. In the case of a video camera
provided with such an automatic exposure control function and 
an electronic-zoom function, no problem occurs during
conventional optical zooming since an angle of view set by
the zooming always coincides with a read-out area of the
image pickup surface of the image pickup element. However,
if the electronic-zoom function is operated, the angle of
view of an optical image to be actually made incident on the
image pickup surface differs from the read-out area of the
image pickup element. As a result, if a picked-up image
signal output from the image pickup element is employed on
an "as is output" basis to enlarge an image by operating
the electronic zoom, the angle of view of the enlarged image
differs from the angle of view of an image area on the image
pickup element which is used for exposure control (a picked-up
image signal contained in an image portion which is not
displayed in an image plane is also employed for exposure
control). This leads to not only the problem that no optimum
exposure control can be applied to the angle of view of the
enlarged image, but also the problem that exposure varies or
becomes unstable during electronic zooming. These problems
adversely affect photography.
