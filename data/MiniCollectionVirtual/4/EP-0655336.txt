<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink container according to
claim 1. This ink container can be installed within an ink jet
unit according to claim 9 and within an ink jet recording
apparatus according to claim 15.In the field of ink jet recording, in recent
years, an ink jet unit in the form of a cartridge, in
which a recording head and an ink container are
integrated into a single unit, has come to be widely
used in order to reduce the apparatus size, to
accomplish a maintenance free operation, and also,
because of some other reasons. This type of ink jet
unit can be easily installed on, or removed from, a
scanning carriage provided in the apparatus, and can
be simply exchanged with a fresh one by a user when
the ink within the ink container is depleted. Also, in the ink jet recording field, demands
for color recording has been mounting highly. As for
a structure that employs the ink jet unit described in
the foregoing to satisfy such demands for color
recording, there are employed as a structure for color
printing, for example: a structure in which a
plurality of ink jet units, each containing a
different color ink, are aligned on the carriage in
parallel with the scanning direction; a structure in
which an integral color ink jet unit comprising color
ink containers, each containing one of the yellow,
magenta, or cyan color inks that are used for color
printing and being aligned in parallel with the
recording heads that eject these inks, respectively,
and an ink jet unit dedicated to eject black ink,
which are disposed on the carriage to effect color
printing, as disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,771,295;
or the like structure.The ink jet unit is discarded with the
recording head when the ink within the ink container
is depleted. However, the durability of the recording
head is extremely long relative to the amount of the
ink containable in the ink container. Therefore,
discarding such an ink jet unit is not preferable from
the view point of natural resource preservation,
environmental protection, or the like.Therefore, a different structure has been 
proposed, such as the one disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,419,678, in which the recording head and ink
container of the ink jet unit are rendered separable
from each other so that it is possible to discard only
the ink depleted container and replace it with a fresh
one.During the installation or removal of the ink
container of the ink jet unit in which the recording
head and ink container are separable, the ink delivery
portion of the ink container is
