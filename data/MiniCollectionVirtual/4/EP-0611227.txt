<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to blood treatment systems, and 
more specifically to an integrated blood treatment fluid module 
which is particularly apt for multi-function treatment of renal 
failure. The utilization and modalities of blood treatment systems is 
ever increasing. Such systems typically entail the in-line withdrawal 
of blood from a patient, extra-corporeal treatment of the blood by a 
blood treatment apparatus, and return of the blood to the patient. In 
order to achieve such blood transfer, as well as remove and/or 
introduce components into the blood stream, as may be desired, 
multiple fluid circuits and pumps may be employed. Blood treatment systems have been developed to carry out 
various treatments such as therapeutic and non therapeutic 
plasmapheresis, extracorporeal blood oxygenation, and blood 
purification and water removal in the case of renal failure. The 
present invention will be described in connection with renal failure. 
However, it is to be understood that this particular example is given 
purely by way of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of 
the invention. For palliating renal failure blood treatment devices are 
used to perform renal functions, such as dialyzers for hemodialysis 
wherein undesired waste components are removed from the blood 
(e.g., urea and creatinine) and desired electrolyte balance in the blood 
is established (e.g., sodium ions). This is typically achieved by 
counter-flowing blood and an isotonic liquid, i.e., dialysate, on 
opposite sides of the dialyzer membrane which allows for diffusive 
transfer therethrough. Blood treatment devices, namely hemofilters  
 
or high-flux dialyzers, are also employed for hemofiltration wherein 
undesired water and certain impurities are removed from blood. This 
is typically accomplished by flowing blood past a high-permeability 
membrane across which a negative pressure gradient is established 
to achieve convective transfer. A fluid substitute is introduced into 
the blood as necessary. High-flux dialyzers allow also for achieving 
hemodiafiltration, which consists of simultaneous hemodialysis and 
hemofiltration. In order to implement such renal failure treatment techniques, 
multiple fluid circuits, pump means and blood conditioning devices 
may be incorporated in a blood therapy apparatus. Further, it should 
be appreciated that since all such components contact body fluids 
during use, they must be disposed of and replaced between uses. To 
date this has entailed the separate
