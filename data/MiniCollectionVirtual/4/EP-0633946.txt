<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rapid dry reagent
chemistry test for Helicobacterpylori. More
specifically, it relates to a test for determining the
presence of a urease producing microorganism such as
Helicobacterpylori in human gastric mucosa biopsy
specimens.In the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal
disorders, the determination of Helicobacterpylori
(formerly known as Campylobacter) is becoming
increasingly important. The presence of spiral or curved
microorganisms in biopsy specimens of human gastric
mucosa has been recognized for several decades
[Freedberg, A. S. and Barron, L. E., The presence of
spirochetes in human gastric mucosa, AM. J. Dis. Dis., 7:
443-5, (1940)]. A bacterium with curved morphology was
cultured from gastric-biopsy specimens from patients with
gastritis in 1982 [Warren, J. R., Unidentified curved
bacilli on gastric epithelium in active chronic
gastritis, Lancet, 1:1273, (1983)] and has recently been
named Helicobacterpylori. Clinical research since 1982
indicates that H.pylori has a role in causing some forms
of gastritis and might also be involved in the 
pathogenesis of peptic ulcers [Peterson, W. L.,
Helicobacterpylori and peptic ulcer disease, New Eng. J.
Med., 324: 1042-8, (1991)].H.pylori grows on the gastric epithelium and does
not penetrate the tissues. It is also found on tissue
from the esophagus and duodenum. The bacterium appears
to be protected from stomach acid by the action of a
urease which the bacterium produces. The urease has very
high specific activity [Dunn, B. E., et al., Purification
and characterization of urease from Helicobacterpylori,
J. Biol. Chem., 265: 9464-9, (1990)] and hydrolyzes
endogenous urea from the host tissues to form ammonia
which neutralizes stomach acid.A recent publication suggests that the best means to
diagnose H.pylori infections in gastric mucosa biopsies
is a combination of culture and direct microscopic
observation of the microorganism on tissue following
histologic staining (Peterson, W. L., op. cit.).
However, the value of culture for this purpose has been
questioned [Martinez, E. and Marcos, A., Helicobacter
pylori and peptic ulcer disease, Lancet, 325: 737,
(1991)].An alternative test for H.pylori utilizes its
urease activity. A mucosal biopsy specimen is incubated
in a medium containing urea and a pH sensitive dye [Owen,
R. J., et al., Rapid urea hydrolysis by gastric
Campylobacters, Lancet, 1: 111, (1985)]. Urease produced
by H.pylori releases ammonia through hydrolysis of urea
and when enough ammonia is
