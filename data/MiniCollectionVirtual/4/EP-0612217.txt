<DESCRIPTION>
Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) produces an insect toxin designated as Î´-endotoxin. 
It is synthesized by the B.t. sporulating cell. The toxin, upon being 
ingested in its crystalline form by susceptible insects, is transformed into 
biologically active moieties by the insect gut juice proteases. The primary target 
is insect cells of the gut epithelium, which are rapidly destroyed. The reported activity spectrum of B.t. covers insect species within the order 
Lepidoptera, many of which are major pests in agriculture and forestry. The 
activity spectrum also includes the insect order Diptera, which includes mosquitos 
and black flies. See Couch, T.L. (1980) "Mosquito Pathogenicity of Bacillus 
thuringiensis var. israelensis," Developments in Industrial Microbiology 22:61-76; 
Beegle, C.C., (1978) "Use of Entomogenous Bacteria in Agroecosystems," 
Developments in Industrial Microbiology 20:97-104. Krieg, et al., Z. ang. Ent. 
(1983) 96:500-508, describe a B.t. isolate named Bacillus thuringiensis var. 
tenebrionis, which is reportedly active against two beetles in the order Coleoptera. 
These are the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and Agelastica 
alni. In European Patent Application No. 0 202 739 there is disclosed a novel B.t. 
isolate active against Coleoptera. It is known as B. thuringiensis var. san diego 
(B.t.s.d.). U.S. Patent No. 4,966,765 discloses the coleopteran-active Bacillus 
thuringiensis isolate B.t. PS86B1. Cockroaches such as the German cockroach (Blatella germancia), Oriental 
cockroach (Blatta orientalis), American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) and  
 
Brown cockroach (Periplaneta americana) are some of the most important insect 
pests in homes and commercial structures. These pests have omnivorous feeding 
habits which result in the destruction of food, leather and fabrics. Cockroaches 
have also been implicated in the transmission of Salmonella and Toxoplasma. 
Cockroaches contain allergins. Approximately 7.5 percent of the human 
population is sensitive to these allergins. Cockroaches are frequently controlled with baits. Because these baits are 
used in homes and restaurants, cockroach insecticides must be safe to humans. 
The heavy use of synthetic insecticides has resulted in the selection of resistant 
cockroach populations. New highly safe insecticides are necessary to control these 
resistant populations. The subject invention concerns a novel Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) isolate 
and genes therefrom which encode novel cockroach-active proteins. The
