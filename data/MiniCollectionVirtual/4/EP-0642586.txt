<ABSTRACT>
Successful culture methods have been developed which result in stable, long-term tissue cultures derived from Taxus explants and hydroponically grown roots. These cultures offer a rapidly reproducible, continuously-available source for the production of purified taxol and taxol-related compounds. Culture methods include in vitro tissue culture and hydroponics. Cultures are initiated with stem or root tissues of Taxus or from roots grown hydroponically. Taxol production may be scaled to commercial levels by use of bioreactors. Screening assays are provided for species and cultures of Taxus that are sources of taxol and taxol-related compounds. In addition to obtaining the same compositions as presently directly extracted from yew trees, new compositions exhibiting taxol-like activity, have been purified from the novel Taxus sources, offering new horizons for chemotherapeutic agent development.

 "Cultured Taxus Tissues as a source of Taxol, Related Taxanes and Other Novel Anti-tumor/Anti-viralCompounds"This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/886,619, filed May 21, 1992, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to cultured Taxus tissues as a source of taxol, 10-deacetyl baccatin III, 7-epi-10-deacetyl baccatin III, baccatin III, 7-epi baccatin III, 9-dihydro-13-acetyl baccatin III, cephalo annine, 10-deacetyl taxol, 7-epilO-deacetyl taxol, 7-epi taxol, other known and novel natural derivatives of these compounds, and other related taxanes including precursors and intermediates in the biochemical pathway resulting in taxol production, and active derivatives of taxol. This invention also relates methods of producing taxol and related compounds from cultured Taxus stems and from Taxus roots, using hydroponics or tissue cultures.Taxol has properties that provide significant clinical benefits. Taxol is the only plant product known to promote the assembly of microtubules and inhibit the tubulin disassembly process. Taxol and taxol-related compounds show positive activity in cancer model assays and microtubule stabilizing assays. Taxol appears to be the prototype of a new class of powerful cancer chemotherapeutic agents (Suffness & Cordell, 1985).Taxol is a potent inhibitor of cell replication that acts as an antimitotic agent, blocking cells in the G2/M phase of the cell (Schiff & Horowitz, 1980; Horowitz et al . , 1986). It is unique in its ability to bind stoichiometrically to polymerized tubulin both in vitro and in vivo, and to induce the assembly of tubulin to form calcium-stable aggregated microtubule structures. These structures resist depoly erization by dilution, calcium ions, cold and a number of microtubule-disrupting drugs. Microtubules assemble tubulin in the absence of 

exogenous guanosine 5 ' -triphosphate or microtubule-associated proteins at low temperatures (Schiff & Horowitz, 1980; ParnessS and Horowitz, 1981; Howard & Timashef , 1988) . Taxol exhibits activity against the KB cancer cell line used to screen for potential chemotherapeutic agents in tissue culture. During preclinical evaluation studies, taxol has been shown to have activity against both urine solid tumor lines and leukemic cell lines (Wani et al . , 1971; Suffness & Cordell, 1985; Donehower et al. , 1987) . Taxol has been shown to be active in the OVCAR-3 human ovarian carcinoma xenograft model and to have promise in the treatment of
