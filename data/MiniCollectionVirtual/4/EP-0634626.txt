<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multilayer film forming
method used in optical devices etc.A multilayer film which is formed by laminating TiO2,
SiO2 etc., is used e.g. for a color separation prism in video
cameras. This film has the function of separating light coming
from an object into light with specific wavelengths, such as red,
blue, and green.Recently, optical devices are required to show high
performance so that they can keep pace with advanced electronics.
This is especially true in terms of multilayer films used e.g.
for a color separation prism which requires uniform thickness and
quality.There are two conventional methods used to control
optical thickness when this kind of multilayer film is formed: a
monochromatic photometric method and a dichroic photometric
method. In the following, an example of the monochromatic
photometric method is explained with reference to FIG. 22.Film forming chamber 61 is kept in high vacuum condition 
through exhaust pump 60. EB (electron beam) gun 62 disposed in
this chamber melts evaporation material 63 by heat. Evaporated
particles 64 reach substrate 66 which is disposed on substrate
holder 65 and form a film. At the same time, after passing
through hole 67 of substrate holder 65, evaporated particles 64
reach monitoring substrate 68 and form a film. Light radiated
with a specific wavelength from light source 69 reaches the film
formed on monitoring substrate 68, and reflected light quantity
is detected at detector 70. Since the reflected light quantity
changes according to the refraction index or thickness of the
film formed on monitoring substrate 68, computer 71 reads the
reflected light quantity while the film is being formed. As soon
as the reflected light quantity reaches a predetermined value,
shutter 72 closes and ends the evaporation process. In this way,
the first layer is completed.In the next phase, evaporation material 63 is replaced
with another material, and monitoring substrate 68 is also
replaced with a new substrate. The same process which took place
in forming the first layer follows, i.e. EB gun 62 melts
evaporation material 63 by heat, and the second layer is formed
on substrate 66. By repeating this operation many times, a
multilayer film having relatively uniform thicknesses is formed.However, the above-mentioned conventional film forming
method has the following problems. Since light quantities reflected and transmitted from the
film are used for this operation, it is extremely difficult to
control with high accuracy of less than 0.5 % due
