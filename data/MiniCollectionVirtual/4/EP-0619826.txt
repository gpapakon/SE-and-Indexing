<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to azetidinol containing
materials having one azetidinol moiety per molecule and reaction
products prepared therefrom.Acrylic polymers have been well known as vehicles for
coating compositions as well as for pigment grind pastes used in
formulating such coating compositions. They can provide tough,
resilient and durable coatings with excellent aesthetic properties.Small nitrogen ring containing materials such as aziridines
have been used as modifiers for coating compositions such as those
described above for sometime. For example, U.S. 3,290,417 to
Christenson et al discloses that the overall properties of coatings
based on interpolymers of hydroxyalkyl esters are greatly improved by
the inclusion of a small proportion of acidic units in the polymeric
vehicle and reacting these acidic groups with an alkyleneimine or a
substituted alkyleneimine. A further example is U.S. 3,290,416 which
discloses coating compositions containing polymerized alkyl
methacrylates which have been modified to improve their properties by
the inclusion of imine-reacted acidic groups.Aziridines, however, despite their potential for improving
the overall properties of coatings formulated with the polymers they
modify, are highly reactive materials which have a number of
attendant disadvantages. Their highly reactive nature makes them
unstable and in addition they are highly toxic requiring special
conditions for handling. The most commonly available forms, ethylene
imine and proplene imine are low molecular weight materials which are
so unstable, safe transportation is virtually impossible. Moreover
they are highly toxic materials which may have carcinogenic side
effects. In addition, materials derived by reacting ethylene imine or
proplene imine with carboxylic acids tend to undergo rearrangement to
the corresponding amide under certain severe conditions like
prolonged heating thereby reducing the yield of desired aminoester
product. Further, their high reactivity often results in a small
amount of homopolymer by-product formation. The homopolymer causes
the final film to be hazy thus impairing the appearance properties of
coatings prepared from these materials.There is a need for a way to prepare modified acrylic
polymers which have all of the beneficial properties of the aziridine
modified materials but without the attendant disadvantages.In accordance with the present invention there is provided
an ungelled reaction product of a carboxylic acid group containing
polymeric material and an azetidinol
