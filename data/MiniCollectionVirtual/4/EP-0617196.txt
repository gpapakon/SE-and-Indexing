<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital mud
pulse telemetry system. The system is particularly (but not
exclusively) useful for measuring while drilling (MWD)
applications.Significant savings of time and, therefore,
expense can be realized in the drilling of wells, such as
oil and gas wells, by obtaining various downhole
measurements without removing the drill string from the
well. Effectively, the well is logged as it is being
drilled. A sub assembly, usually positioned just above the
drill bit, carries the measuring equipment. During a pause
in the drilling activity, such as when additional drill pipe
segments are added to the drill string at the surface,
measurements are taken and raw data signals are initially
processed in the sub assembly. Data may be stored in the
sub assembly for retrieval when the drill string is
withdrawn from the well, for example. Such interim data
retrieval may be cost-effective. However, one or another
telemetry technique may be utilized to transmit the data to
the surface for processing and utilization while the well is
still being drilled. One category of MWD telemetry available utilizes acoustic signals
transmitted through the drilling mud being circulated through the interior of the
drill string. Such mud is introduced into the drill string at the surface, passes
down the interior of the drill string and out through one or more apertures in the
drill bit. From there, the mud circulates back to the surface by means of the
annular region between the exterior of the drill string and the wall of the well
being drilled. The drilling mud thus carries cuttings to the surface from the
bottom of the well, and lubricates and cools the drill bit. Additionally, the
column of drilling mud thus formed within the well acts as a dynamic plug to
counter high pressure fluid that may be released from an underground formation
and enter the well. At the surface, the returning drilling mud may be processed
to remove cuttings, and to be degassed, for example, after which the mud can be
recirculated back down the interior of the drill string. A pump drives the mud
into the drill string.The downhole measuring-while-drilling sub assembly may be equipped
with an appropriate transmitter including a valve assembly to communicate with
the surface along the mud column within the drill string. The valve is
appropriately opened and closed to produce binary, bi-level pulse pressure
waves in the mud within the drill string that propagate to the surface where they
may be sensed by a pressure
