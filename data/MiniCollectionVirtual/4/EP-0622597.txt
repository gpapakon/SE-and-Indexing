<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for smelting metal and for processing molten metal, particularly non-ferrous metal, the solid metal being fed to a chamber and being carried from one chamber to another through passages which connect the chambers to one another, the metal simultaneously being melted or processed by means of thermal radiation from the tops of the chambers. In this arrangement one or more pumps act on the space above the molten metal in one or more pump chambers which are connected to the pump, each of which chambers is connected in the region of the bottom to a molten chamber by way of passages which carry molten metal to the pump chamber and connected to a spray chamber from where molten metal is fed to a pipe for processing or recycling. The invention is characterised in that approximately three times to fifteen times the quantity and, in the optimum case, six times to ten times the quantity of molten metal per unit time is supplied to the spray chamber by each pump chamber as from the same pump chambers to the spray chamber if the pressure in the pump-chamber space above the molten metal increases or decreases.

Method for melting of metal and for processing of molten metals,
particularly of non-ferrous metal, whereby the solid metal is supplied to

a chamber (1) and is fed from one chamber to another one (3, 5, 10,

melting or processing by thermal radiation from the chamber lids, one
or more pumps (40, 41) acting on the space above the molten metal in

one or more pump chambers (10, 11) connected with the pump, each
of which is connected at the bottom part through ducts with a melt

splash chamber (18, 15) from where molten metal is taken away to a

pipe (19) to be consumed or recycled, characterized in that the amount
of the melt as is fed from each pump chamber (10, 11) to the

connected splash chamber (18, 15) is approximately three to fifteen

chamber space when the pressure increases respectively decreases.
