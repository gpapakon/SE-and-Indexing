<ABSTRACT>
One embodiment of a mechanical emergency dual-release mechanism for use in combination with a helicopter external cargo hook system that includes a cargo hook assembly that is operative to jettison an externally-attached cargo includes an interface member for mounting the dual-release mechanism in rigid combination with the cargo hook assembly, a pulley axle (14) mounted in rigid combination with the interface member, a cockpit pulley assembly (20) mounted in rotatable combination with the pulley axle, a cabin pulley assembly (30) mounted in rotatable combination with the pulley axle, and a displacement transfer member that operatively inter connects the cockpit pulley assembly and the cabin pulley assembly. The cabin pulley assembly is functionally interconnected to the cargo hook assembly and operative in response to a mechanical stimulus generated by means of the cockpit pulley assembly or the cabin pulley assembly to activate the cargo hook assembly to jettison the externally-attached cargo.

 DescriptionA MECHANICAL EMERGENCY DUAL-RELEASE MECHANISM FOR AN EXTERNAL CARGO HOOK SYSTEMTechnical FieldThe present invention is directed to external cargo hook systems for helicopters, and more particularly, to a mechanical emergency dual- release mechanism for helicopter external cargo hook systems that is operative to allow jettisoning of externally-attached cargo by either the pilot/co-pilot or a crew member.Background ArtThe transport of load packages (cargo and/or passengers) is, by definition, the primary function of a utility helicopter. Typically, a utility helicopter is preconfigured, or may be reconfigured as required, to perform such a cargo-transport function. For example, a utility helicopter may be configured solely for the transport of cargo, or alternatively, may be preconfigured primarily for the transport of passengers, with the capability to be readily reconfigured for the transport of cargo (e.g., by removing interior seating).It is often more practical, as well as posing less of a risk, to utilize only the interior of a utility helicopter for the cargo-transport function. The weight and balance of the load package can be suitably distributed within the interior of the helicopter, thereby ensuring that the flight operations of the helicopter are conducted within the approved flight envelope of the helicopter. An internally-transported load package is shielded against adverse environmental conditions by the helicopter airframe. In addition, the pilot is not required to extend his situational awareness, which thereby increases pilot workload, during flight operations to accommodate cargo that temporarily alters the external spatial envelope of the helicopter. Utilizing only the interior of a utility helicopter for the cargo- transport function, however, while having advantages of the ilk described in the preceding paragraph, does tend to circumscribe the overall usefulness of the utility helicopter. The cargo-carrying capability of the helicopter is limited to cargo having overall external dimensions that are compatible with the dimensions of the helicopter cargo door(s), i.e., that can be loaded through the cargo door(s). Pragmatically, therefore, 

oversized cargo (external dimensions greater than the cargo door dimensions) or cargo having unusual external dimensions/configurations cannot be transported internally within the helicopter.To enhance the versatility of a utility helicopter for the cargo- carrying function, the helicopter may be equipped with an external cargo hook
