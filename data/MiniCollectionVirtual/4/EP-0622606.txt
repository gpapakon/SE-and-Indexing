<ABSTRACT>
A centring tool (10) for use with a telescopic cylinder 
wall gauge (11) with opposed, spring-loaded contact 

plungers (15, 16), to measure the inside diameter (31) of 
the cylinder includes a mounting base (17) having spaced, 

angularly-disposed, apertured mounting surfaces (23, 24), 
a centring pin (27, 28) secured within each mounting 

surface (23, 24), a bore (25) extending through said 
mounting base (17) in the same plane as or a parallel plane 

to the axes of said centring pins, and means (26) for 
aligning and securing the centring tool on a mounting body 

(14) of the telescopic cylinder wall gauge. 
The centring tool adapts to cylinder gauges to provide a 
fast, accurate one-time reading of the cylinder gauge and 

provides adjustable interalignment elements to provide 
positive positioning of the gauge within the interior of 

the cylinder bore to determine the internal diameter of the 
cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a centring tool for a cylinder 
gauge and more particularly to a telescopic gauge that is 
used to transfer the interdimensions of a cylinder for 
measuring purposes within thousandths of an inch (one 
inch = 25.40 mm). Known devices have relied on a variety of different 
structural configurations that are adapted to provide 
automatic centring of measuring gauges within cylinders. 
Examples of such are US-A-2,470,635; US-A-3,836,277, 
US-A-4,754,551 and US-A-4,773,164. Telescopic gauges are known to which the invention is 
designed to adapt and are used to transfer internal 
measurements from the cylinder to be measured with 
precision calibers. These gauges have opposite 
telescopically extensible spring-urged contact plungers 
that can be locked once within the cylinder and then 
removed and measured. US-A-2,470,635 shows a gauge positioned on a central shaft. 
The gauge has a pair of chucks with resilient jaws 
extending therefrom. In US-A-3,836,277, a centring tool is disclosed wherein a 
tool is centred within a cylinder by pins on respective 
spring-urged arms pivoted about and to the tool. US-A-4,754,551 is directed to a centring gauge tool in 
which sensing fingers are mounted on a conical insert and 
expand outwardly to engage the inner surface, centring and 
measuring the tool.  US-A-4,773,164 shows a self-aligning caliber bar in which 
two sets of aligned spaced pivoting fingers extend 
outwardly from a central mounting body to align same within 
a cylinder enclosure. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
centring tool for use with a telescopic cylinder wall gauge 
to measure inside diameter of the cylinder, the gauge 
including a handle and a pair of oppositely disposed spring 
loaded contact plungers extending from a mounting body 
thereof, characterised in that said centring tool, a bore 
extending through said mounting base in the same plane as 
or a parallel plane to the axes of said centring pins, and 
means for aligning and securing said centring tool on the 
mounting body of said telescopic cylinder wall gauge. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to 
show how the same may be carried into effect, reference 
will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a telescopic cylinder 
gauge with a centring tool positioned thereon; Figure 2 is a plan view of the centring tool; Figure 3 is a front view of the centring tool; Figure 4 is a cross-sectional view on
