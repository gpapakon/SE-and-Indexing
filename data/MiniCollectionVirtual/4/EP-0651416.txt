<ABSTRACT>
A circuit breaker (10) includes a housing and an 
operating mechanism (12) contained within the housing. An 

indicating arrangement (16) is carried by the operating 
mechanism (12) and is displaceable relative to the housing 

under the action of the operating mechanism (12) for 
indicating the status of the operating mechanism (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a circuit breaker. Luxembourg patent application No.56244 to Teco, forming the base of the preamble of claim 1, 
discloses a circuit breaker which has an indicating arrangement 
to distinguish between tripping of the circuit breaker as a 
result of various types of faults, more particularly, overload 
faults and earth leakage faults. The indicating arrangement 
comprises a first indicating device which is fixed to a moving 
contact carrier of the circuit breaker and which is visible 
through a window in a housing of the circuit breaker when the 
circuit breaker has tripped due to an earth leakage fault. The 
indicating arrangement further comprises a second indicating 
device which is visible through the window when the circuit 
breaker has tripped due to an overload fault condition. A problem with the indicating arrangement of this 
circuit breaker is that, due to the fact that the first 
indicating device is fixed to the moving contact carrier, it is 
visible through the window either when the circuit breaker has 
tripped due to an earth leakage fault or when the circuit breaker 
has been switched off. In this regard, the operating handle of  
 
the circuit breaker is only movable between an 'on' position and 
an 'off' position. Thus, it is not possible to determine when 
the circuit breaker has been switched off or when it has tripped 
due to an earth leakage fault condition. It will be appreciated 
that, if the circuit breaker has tripped due to an earth leakage 
fault condition, to attempt to reset the circuit breaker can be 
life threatening. Further, the second indicating device is a dedicated 
arrangement which needs to be fitted within the small space of 
the housing of the circuit breaker and comprises a lever with its 
associated pivot pins, springs etc. This increases the 
complexity and hence the cost of the circuit breaker. German patent application No.1563831 to Stotz-Kontakt-GMBH, 
discloses a circuit breaker having a two position switch 
and an indicating device. The disclosure teaches only that the 
indicating device is visible through a window in the housing 
under an earth leakage trip condition. There is no teaching in 
the specification of what, if any, indicating device is provided 
for showing tripping due to an overload fault condition. 
Further, due to the fact that the handle is only a two position 
handle it is not apparent that it is possible to distinguish 
between tripping as a result of an overload fault condition or 
switching off of the circuit

<CLAIMS>
A circuit breaker (10) which includes a housing (14) having a window (18) 
defined therein; 


an operating mechanism (12) contained within the housing (14), the operating 
mechanism (12) being operable to trip as a result of an overload fault condition and an 

earth leakage fault condition; and 
an indicating means (16) carried by the operating mechanism (12) and being 
displaceable relative to the housing (14) under the action of the operating mechanism 

(12) for indicating the status of the operating mechanism (12), characterised in that 
operating mechanism (12) includes an operating handle (26) which is movable between 

an "on" position, an "off" position and a tripped position and that the indicating means 
(16) includes a first indicating element (40) and a second indicating element (42) 

associated with the operating mechanism (12), the first indicating element (40) being 
visible through the window (18) when the operating mechanism (12) has tripped due to 

an overload fault condition and the second indicating element (42) being visible through 
the window (18) when the operating mechanism (12) has tripped due to an earth 

leakage fault condition. 
The circuit breaker (10) as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that the 
indicating means (16) includes a slider (32) mounted on the handle (26) to be 

displaceable with the handle (26) and relative to the window (18) of the housing (14). 
The circuit breaker (10) as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that the slider 
(32) carries indicia (36, 38) thereon for indicating whether the operating mechanism 

(12) is in its on position or off position, the appropriate indicia (36, 38) being visible 
through the window (18) of the housing (14) depending on the position of the operating 

mechanism (12). 
The circuit breaker (10) as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in that the slider 
(32) has an opening (34) defined therein which, when the handle (26) of the operating  

 
mechanism (12) is in its tripped position, lies in register with the window (18) of the 

housing (14). 
The circuit breaker (10) as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in that an 
appropriate one of the indicating elements (40, 42) is visible through the opening (34) 

and the window (18) when the operating mechanism (12) is in its tripped position. 
The circuit breaker (10) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the first indicating element (40) is a first flag carried on a cradle 

(28) of the operating mechanism (12). 
The circuit breaker (10) as claimed in Claim 6 characterised in that the second 
indicating element (42) is a second flag carried by a reset lever (30) of the operating 

mechanism (12). 
The circuit breaker as claimed in Claim 7 characterised in that the first flag (40) 
is distinguishable from the second flag (42).
