<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aircraft landing gear, of the lateral retraction type, with tandem wheels. In accordance with the invention, the leg (50) is formed by a V-shaped casing (10) the two branches (11, 12) of which are articulated together, with a first branch forming a beam (11) articulated on the aircraft structure, and a second branch (12) at the end of which a wheel-carrying bogey beam (14) is articulated. A damper (17) links the two branches (11, 12) so as to form a triangle which is fixed when the gear is raised or lowered. The bogey beam (14) extends on either side of its central axis (15), and it is linked, by means of a positional element (27), to a link rod (25) articulated to the first branch (11) of the casing, this link rod additionally being linked to the said first branch by a linkage (30) which is itself linked to the aircraft structure by a guide bar (35). Thus, in gear-down position, the linkage (30) constitutes an alignment device and the front part of the bogey beam (14) is raised, while the bogey beam (14) is substantially parallel to the first branch (11) of the casing when the gear is raised.
