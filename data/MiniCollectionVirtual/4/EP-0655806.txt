interfitting engagement of connector housings includes first 

and second connector housings (4, 10) fitted one into the 
other into interfitting engagement, a plurality of pairs of 

terminals (6 , 15) disposed in the respective connector 
housings (4, 10) and electrically connected together upon 

the interfitting engagement of the first and second 
connector housings (4, 10), a short-circuiting terminal (14) 

usually urged so as to make a short circuit between at least 
two of the terminals (15) disposed in the second connector 

housing (10), an actuator (12) displacing the short-circuiting 
terminal (14) upon the interfitting engagement of 

the first and second connector housings (4, 10) so that the 
short-circuiting terminal (14) is departed from the 

terminals (15) disposed in the second connector housing 
(10), and a pair of interfitting engagement detecting 

terminals (6a) disposed in the first connector housing (4)

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector with
a function of detecting interfitting engagement of male and
female connector housings according to the preamble of claim 1.Air bag system has rapidly come into wide use for
protecting automobile drivers and passengers against shock
upon occurrence of crash of automobiles. An operating
circuit for the air bag system comprises terminals connected
to an ignition device for a gas generating agent
accommodated in an inflator and terminals connected via a
crash sensor to a power source, these terminals being
connected together by an electrical connector. When the
crash sensor senses shock due to crash of the automobile,
electric current is supplied to the ignition device so that
the gas generating agent is ignited. A large amount of gas
is produced in a moment and fed into a bag, thereby
inflating it.The air bag system is required to reliably operate in
crash of the automobile while malfunction thereof needs to
be avoided in occasions other than occurrence of crash.
Male and female terminals of the connector are disconnected
when the air bag system is installed in the automobile or
when the air bag system is inspected, for example. In this
regard, the terminals accommodated in the connector housing
at the side of the air bag are opened. Even in such a
condition, there is a possibility that a magnetic or 
electric field generated around the connector induces
voltage between the disconnected terminals. In this case,
the electric current accidentally flows into the ignition
device of the inflator, resulting in malfunction of the air
bag system.In view of the above-described problem, the prior art
has provided an electrical connector with a function of
preventing malfunction of the air bag system. The connector
comprises male and female connector housings accommodating
male and female terminals respectively. A pair of female
terminals are connected to the ignition device of the
inflator. A short-circuiting terminal is disposed in the
female connector housing so that a short circuit is usually
made between the pair of female terminals. The short-circuiting
terminal is displaced to be away from the pair of
female terminals when the female and male connector housings
are fitted one into the other.In the above-described connector, an operator needs to
visually inspect as to whether or not the short-circuiting
terminal has released the female terminals from the short-circuited
condition in the interfitting engagement of the
male and female connector housings.

electrically connected together upon the interfitting engagement of the first and

second connector housings (4, 10), a short-circuiting terminal (14) usually urged
so as to make a short circuit between at least two of the terminals (15) disposed in

the second connector housing (10), and an actuator (12) displacing the short-circuiting
terminal (14) upon the interfitting engagement of the first and second

connector housings (4, 10) so that the short-circuiting terminal (14) is departed
from said at least two terminals (15) disposed in the second connector

housing (10), characterized by a pair of interfitting engagement detecting
terminals (6a) provided in the first connector housing (4) so that a short circuit is

made therebetween by the short-circuiting terminal (14) when the same has been
displaced.
An electrical connector according to claim 1, characterized in that the actuator
(12) integrally projects from a cover (3) mounted on the first connector housing

(4) so as to be rotatively moved between a first state in which the cover (3) lies
along the outer surface of the first connector housing (4) and a second state in

which the cover (3) rises from the first state.
An electrical connector according to claim 2, characterized in that the cover (3)
