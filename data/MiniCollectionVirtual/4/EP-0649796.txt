<ABSTRACT>
A package for dispensing a substance that imparts a 

desirable property to a body of water. 
comprises a water permeable bag (68) of non-woven 

fabric (15) enclosing a predetermined quantity of particulated 
product, such as tea or coffee that releases a flavouring 

substance in steeping liquid. The non-woven fabric (15) has a 
thermally activated bonding surface (14) permitting to 

permanently close the bag (82) by peripherally heat-sealing the 
bag walls to one another. The heat-sealing operation is 

performed by driving in the wall portions to be joined a 
multitude of heated projections (62) that rapidly transfer heat 

to the thermally activated bonding layers in order to 
quickly effect the seal. The resulting joint area (86) 

displays a plurality of perforations (88) formed by the heated 
projections. The invention also extends to a method and 

apparatus for heat-sealing the dispensing package.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package for 
dispensing a substance that imparts a desirable property 
to a body of fluid. In an exemplary form of construction 
the dispensing package is an infusion packet that releases 
a desired flavouring agent, as tea or coffee, in steeping 
liquid. The dispensing package in accordance with the 
invention has a foraminous bag of non-woven fibrous 
material enclosing the water treating substance, 
characterized by an improved heat-seal permanently joining 
the bag walls. The heat-seal is highly resistant and can 
be formed on high speed machines. The invention also 
extends to a method and to an apparatus for heat-sealing 
the dispensing package. Common infusion packets utilize water-permeable bags 
of paper material to contain the percolative product, such 
as tea, coffee or herb particles. The porosity of the 
paper bag is selected to prevent the percolative product 
to sift-out of the water-diffusion apertures, while  
 
allowing the flavouring substance released in the steeping 
liquid to freely egress the infusion packet and disperse 
in the surrounding body of water. Paper bags offer the advantage of being relatively 
inexpensive. In addition they can be sealed on high speed 
automatic equipment that enables to mass produce the 
infusion package at low cost. However, paper material has 
some drawbacks, such as a poor wet-strength that may cause 
the infusion packet to break open in use or otherwise 
undesirably dispel its contents. Furthermore, the paper 
material may not have a degree of water-permeability that 
is sufficiently high for an optimal percolation effect to 
take place. Infusion packets have also been manufactured with 
bags of fibrous, non-woven material, as disclosed in the 
Canadian patent 802,720 granted to Johnson & Johnson, 
U.S.A. on December 31, 1968, which discloses a package according 
to the preamble of claim 1. Bags of non-woven 
fibrous material present certain advantages over 
paper bags such as an increased wet strength and a higher 
water-permeability. However, bags of non-woven fibrous 
material are difficult to seal in a reliable fashion on 
conventional high-speed equipment primarily due to the 
fact that the bag walls must remain in contact with the 
heat-sealing dies for a comparatively long period of time  
 
which significantly reduces the overall production rate, 
thereby making the final product more expensive to 
manufacture. An object of the present invention is a package for 
dispensing a substance to treat a body of
