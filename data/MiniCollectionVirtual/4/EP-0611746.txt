<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new hydroxy 
ethyl bibenzoate compound and a method of producing 
the compound. More particularly, this invention 
relates to a hydroxy ethyl bibenzoate compound 
containing less than 2.5% diethylene glycol. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a new bis-β-hydroxy 
ethyl bibenzoate containing less than 2.5% 
diethylene glycol, a method for making the compound 
and use of the compound in the production of 
polyesters. Biphenyl dicarboxylic acid has been used as 
a monomer to produce polymers which may find use in 
high temperature applications. However, problems have 
been encountered in reducing undesired substituents 
attached to the bibenzoate. The methyl or ethyl ester 
is used instead of biphenyl dicarboxylic acid to 
overcome its poor reactivity as biphenyl dicarboxylic 
acid has a low solubility, a high melting point and 
melting is accompanied by dis-association. The 
synthesis of methyl or ethyl esters of biphenyl 
dicarboxylic acid is difficult, requiring high 
temperature and pressure. Although the methyl ester 
of biphenyl dicarboxylic acid can be produced from 
methanol and biphenyl dicarboxylic acid using a 
catalyst, a good, safe commercial process has not been 
developed. Use of the ester also adds process steps 
to produce and purify the ester. A large portion of 
the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is 
based upon the use of terephthalic acid and ethylene 
glycol, not the dimethyl terephthalate, so the 
inclusion of another comonomer in the form of the 
methyl ester of a dicarboxylic acid is undesirable. 
The inclusion of the methyl or ethyl ester of a 
dicarboxylic acid results in the formation of methanol 
or ethanol which is distilled off with the ethylene  
 
glycol during the production of the PET. The ethylene 
glycol cannot be recycled in this process without 
being purified to remove the methanol or ethanol 
byproduct, adding cost and complexity to the process. A need remains for a substantially pure, 
highly reactive material that can be used in processes 
based upon polyethylene terephthalate, dimethyl 
terephthalate and terephthalic acid to improve the 
properties of the materials. It is an object of this invention to provide 
a substantially pure hydroxy ethyl bibenzoate. It is another object of this invention to 
produce bis-β-hydroxy ethyl bibenzoate containing less 
than 2.5%, and preferably less than 1%, diethylene 
glycol. It is a further object of this invention to 
provide a process for the production of bis-β-hydroxy
