<ABSTRACT>
The table is designed in particular for sales; it allows quick and uncomplicated erection from the space-saving, collapsed state. The table frame (1) can be adjusted from a square to an elongate, rectangular configuration - suitably dimensioned table tops then being required for completion. The cross struts (3a to 3d) arranged at the top on the table legs (2a to 2d) run on a scissor joint (5) situated at the point of intersection (4). The construction and the dimensioning of the scissor joint (5) and the table frame (1) are disclosed.

Variable table for displaying goods, comprising 
a table frame (1) with transverse struts (3a to 3d) and 

table legs (2a to 2d) fastened thereon, and also comprising 
a screw-on table top (15), characterized in that 

there is arranged in the frame centre, the point of 
intersection (4), a shear-type articulation (5) which has 

four identical articulation elements (30a to 30d) and 
effects the identical adjustment of in each case one pair 

of transverse struts (made up of 3a to 3d) with respect 
to the opposite pair of transverse struts (likewise made 

up of 3a to 3d), and in that the table frame (1) is thus 
fully collapsible - the pairs of transverse struts (3a 

and 3b; 3c and 3d) lie against one another in parallel in 
each case and are aligned one beneath the other - and can 

be variably adjusted from a square configuration to an 
elongate rectangular configuration. 
Variable table according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, from the top ends of the table legs (2a 

to 2d), where the transverse struts (3a to 3d) are seated 
in notches (12a to 12d), the four transverse struts (3a 

to 3d) of the table frame (1) run towards in each case 
one of the articulation elements (30a to 30d), which are 

arranged around the point of intersection (4), and are 
fitted firmly thereon. 
Variable table according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the table top (15) is fixed on the table 

legs (2a to 2d) by cap-like corner elements (9a to 9d) 
and the table corners (7a to 7d) are covered, or in that 

the table top (15) is fixed by corner supports (11a to 
11d), the corner supports having in each case two vertically  

 
extending push-in grooves (28a and 28a' to 28d and 

28d') which are at right angles to one another, are 
aligned in parallel with the table edges and are provided 

for securing the surround segments (10a to 10d), which 
stand vertically on the border of the table top (15). 
Variable table according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the geometrical variables of the table 

frame (1) with the shear-type articulation (5) arranged 
at the point of intersection (4) are determined in 

accordance with the approximate formulae:

Shear-type articulation (5) for a table according 
to Claim 1, 2 or 4, characterized in that each 

articulation element (e.g. 30b) comprises an 
articulation-element body (31b) and a plug-on connection 

piece (32b) for receiving the transverse strut (3b), the 
articulation-element body (31b) being formed by a top 

outer plate (34b) and a bottom outer plate (34b'), by a 
guide plate (35b) and by a vertical connection web (36b), 

into which the three horizontal, trapezoidal and 
congruent plates merge, and in that two vertically 

aligned pivot-point bores (37b and 37b') pass through all 
the plates, and in that, furthermore, the guide plate 

(35b) is spaced apart from the top outer plate (34b) by 
the distance of the guidance gap (45b), this distance 

being given by the material thickness of the outer plates 
plus play. 
Shear-type articulation (5) according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the articulation elements (30a to 

30d) are combined in pairs around the point of intersection 
(4) in a turned arrangement, as a result of which 

parts of the bottom outer plates (35b' and 34d') which 
the mutually opposite guidance gaps (45a and 45c) receive  

 
are respectively adjacent on either side, and conversely 

the guidance gaps (45b and 45d) receive parts of the - 
upwardly facing - bottom outer plates (34a' and 34c') 

which are respectively adjacent on either side, the 
shear-type articulation (5) being held together by bolts 

(38a to 38d), with a pivot-pin function, which pass 
through the pivot-point bores (37a and 37a' to 37d and 

37d'). 
Shear-type articulation (5) according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that each articulation part (
e.g. 30b) 
is produced as a cast or moulded element, and the plug-on 

connection piece (32b) has an I-profile which has longitudinally 
extending clamping beads (33b) on the outer 

sides.
