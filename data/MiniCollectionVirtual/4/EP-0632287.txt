<ABSTRACT>
In a radio signal detecting system, an antenna (1, 14, 
51, 52) is rotatably mounted on a wrist watch type case 

(41, 71), and this antenna is manually rotated to receive a 
radio signal reflected from a target to be distance-measured 

every time the antenna is rotated by a preselected 
rotation angle. The reflected radio signal is digitally 

converted into field strength data, or distance data. 
These field strength data, or distance data are 

sequentially stored into a memory circuit (16, 61) in 
correspondence with the rotation angle of the antenna. 

Since the data stored into the memory circuit (16, 61) at 
every rotation angle for the antenna are displayed on a 

liquid crystal display unit (24, 64), the radio signal 
detecting system can be made compact and operated under low 

power consumption.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a radio
signal detecting system capable of detecting a radio signal
reflected from a target. More specifically, the present
invention is directed to a compact radio signal detecting
system capable of measuring a distance from the target and
a direction of the target, and also capable of detecting
azimuth of an incoming radio signal transmitted from other
radio signal transmitter.Radar systems have been widely utilized in air crafts
and ships in order to navigate these vehicles and to
confirm present positions of the vehicles with respect to a
target, and also utilized in meteorological observations.
Typically, in a radar system employed in one ship, an
electromagnetic wave in a pulse form such as a microwave
pulse signal, is transmitted from an antenna at a speed of
300,000 km/sec., and this pulse signal impinges on other ships
and at land. Then, pulse signals are reflected from these
objects and processed to measure distances between this
ship and other ships. These measured distances are
displayed on a CRT display screen.This type of conventional marine radar system is
arranged by a large-scale transmitter apparatus with
employment of a magnetron and the like, a bulky rotary slot
antenna having a length of 1 to 3 m and an antenna unit, a
display apparatus equipped with an after-image type large
CRT screen, and a motor unit for rotating the slot antenna.
Accordingly, this marine radar system can own various
merits, e.g., high power, high precision, and hard
operation conditions. However, there are drawbacks such as
bulky system and high power consumption.On the other hand, in commercial ships such as fishing
boats and container carrier ships, and salvage stations,
azimuth detecting systems are utilized to correctly detect
azimuth of a signal radiation source by measuring azimuth
of an incoming radio signal having a specific frequency. 
In the azimuth detecting system, the incoming radio signals
are received by the first loop-shaped antenna and the
second vertically-arranged antenna. The first loop antenna
is rotated to receive the radio signals at every
preselected rotation angle, and field strengths of these
received radio signals are measured. Then, the direction
of one radio signal having the highest field strength is
detected as the direction of the incoming radio signal
reflected from the target. Since this first loop antenna
inherently owns such an antenna characteristic that the
field strengths become high when the first loop antenna is
located at 90Â°
