<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatic spreader, consisting of a supply container, of metering members assigned to the supply container, of pneumatic conveying conduits (2, 2', 2'') leading from the metering members to distributor members (3, 3', 3'') and of delivery conduits (4) leading from the distributor members (3, 3', 3'') to the discharge members (5, 5'). In order to provide a remedy here in a simple way, provision is made for providing at least two groups of metering members, for each group of metering members to be assigned a conveying conduit (2, 2', 2'') having distributor members (3, 3', 3''), for seed coulters (5, 5') to be connected to the distributor members (3, 3', 3'') via hoses (4), for one group of metering members to be connected to the so-called aisle seed coulters (5') via a conveying conduit (2') and a distributor member (3'), and for the other group or other groups of metering members to be connected to the remaining seed coulters (5) by means of its or their conveying conduit or conduits (2, 2'') and distributor member or members (3, 3'').
