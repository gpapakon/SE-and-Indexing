Drilling tool, in particular rock drill, with a drill
head (2), a fixing shank (4) and an interposed spiral shank

(3), the drill head and the fixing shank (4) being formed in
several parts with the spiral shank (3) and being connected to

one another at least in part via a screw thread and the spiral
shank (3) simultaneously being designed as a conveying spiral

(3) which acts as a fastening screw thread (7) for the fixing
shank (4), characterised in that the spiral shank (3) also

acts as a fastening thread (7, 10) for the drill head (2), at
least the threaded portion (7, 8) being reduced in its

diameter (d
6
) relative to the external diameter (d
3
) of the
spiral shank (3) to receive the drill head (2).
Drilling tool according to claim 1, characterised in that
the spiral shank (3) consists of a screw-threaded rod cut to

the necessary length.
Drilling tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the spiral shank (3) consists of a screw-threaded rod

with a trapezoidal thread or the like.
Drilling tool according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the drill head (2) and/or the fixing

shank (4) has a substantially cylindrical external surface (6,
9) at least in the region of the screw-threaded socket for the

spiral shank (3).
Drilling tool according to claim 4, characterised in that
the external surface (6) of the drill head (2) has additional

drilling dust grooves.
Drilling tool according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in
that the drill head (2) has at least one hard metal plate (5)

of which the nominal diameter (D
1
) is greater than the diameter
(d
1
) of the external surface (6) of the drill head (2). 
Drilling tool according to claim 1, characterised in that
the threaded portion (10, 11) for receiving the drill shank

(4) is smaller in diameter (d
6
) than the external diameter (d
3
)
of the spiral shank (3).
Drilling tool according to claim 1 or 7, characterised in
that the external diameter (d
1
) of the drill head and/or the
external diameter (d
2
) of the fixing shank (4) is substantially
equal in the region of the screw-threaded socket (7, 8 or 11,

10) to the external diameter (d
3
) of the free conveying spiral
portion (l
7
) of the spiral shank (3).
Drilling tool according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the conveying spiral (3) is designed

with one or more threads.
Drilling tool according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the conveying spiral (3) is designed as

a twisted longitudinal profile.
