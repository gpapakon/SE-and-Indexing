<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic toner showing a good 
fixability onto recording paper is constituted by at 

least a binder resin and a colorant, the binder resin 
comprising a resin component having a polar group, the 

binder resin having a molecular weight distribution 
according to gel permeation chromatography including a 

peak in a molecular weight region of 5x10³ - 5x10⁴. 
The toner is used to develop an electrostatic image 

formed on a electrophotographic photosensitive member 
including at least an electroconductive support, a 

charge generation layer and a charge transport layer, 
and the resultant toner image is transferred onto a 

recording medium without difficulties such as 
occurrence of cracks on the photosensitive member or 

inferior transferability by using a photosensitive 
member having a surface layer containing a transition 

metal atom at 0.1 - 10 ppm. The surface of the 
photosensitive member may preferably show a fluorine 

atom/carbon atom (F/C) ratio or/and a silicon 
atom/carbon atom (Si/C) ratio, respectively, of 0.03 - 

1.0 as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image 
forming method using an electrophotographic 
photosensitive member and a toner. Various forms of electrophotographic 
photosensitive members are used so as to obtain 
desired characteristics depending on the 
electrophotographic processes used. Typical 
electrophotographic photosensitive members include one 
having a photoconductor layer as an image bearing 
layer on a substrate, and one having laminar layers as 
an image bearing layer including a photoconductor 
layer and an insulating layer thereon disposed on a 
substrate. The photosensitive member comprising a 
photoconductor layer on a substrate may be used in an 
electrophotographic process including a charging step, 
an exposure step and a developing step, and optionally 
a transfer step. The insulating layer disposed on a type of 
photosensitive member is provided of various purposes, 
such as protection of the photoconductor layer, an 
improvement in mechanical strength of the 
photosensitive member, an improvement in dark 
attenuation characteristic, and application to a 
specific electrophotographic process.  
 Typical examples of such a photosensitive 
member having an insulating layer and an 
electrophotographic process using such a 
photosensitive member having an insulating layer are 
described in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 2,860,048, and 
Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) 41-16429, JP-B 38-15446, 
JP-B 46-3713, JP-B 42-23910, JP-B 43-24748, JP-B 
42-19747, and JP-B 36-4121. An electrophotographic photosensitive member 
is required to exhibit prescribed sensitivity, 
electric characteristic and further optical 
characteristic depending on the electrophotographic 
process to which the photosensitive member is applied. 
Moreover, the photosensitive member is required to 
exhibit a durability as an important property. It is 
difficult to obtain stably clear images under various 
environmental conditions by using a photosensitive 
member which exhibits a remarkably lower surface 
potential under a high-humidity condition even if it 
exhibits excellent electrophotographic 
characteristics. In an electrophotographic process 
including a transfer step, the photosensitive member 
is generally used repetitively, so that the surface 
substance is liable to be damaged due to breakage of 
chemical bond, and the surface resistivity is liable 
to be lowered due to attack of ionized oxygen, ozone, 
moisture, etc., thus being liable to cause a lowering  
 
in static charge retention power of the photosensitive 
memb
