<ABSTRACT>
A one-chip type microcomputer or microprocessor includes 
a one-time programmable flash memory (FMRY) and a central 

processing unit (CPU) allowed to access the flash memory. The 
flash memory (FMRY) further includes a plurality of electrically 

erasable and programmable non-volatile memory elements 
arranged in a matrix pattern. The non-volatile memory element 

is made reprogrammable by erasure and writing only when a 
test mode (an operation mode exclusively utilizable by manufacturers 

of microcomputers) is designated by an external 
terminal (15). On the other hand, the flash memory is set 

one-time programmable by writing in a non-test mode (an op-eration 
mode inclusively utilizable by users of microcomputers) 

designated by the external terminal. The one-chip microcomputer 
or microprocessor is sealed in a plastic package 

with a pin-to-pin pitch of 0.5 mm or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a one-chip or 
single-chip type microcomputer with a built-in flash 
type memory having electrically erasable and programmable 
non-volatile memory elements and more particularly 
to a microcomputer to be so configured as to 
make user specification with respect to the flash type 
memory one-time programmable (information written once 
remains unerasable). Japanese Laid-opened Patent Publication No. 
289997/1990 discloses a flash EEPROM (Electrically 
Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory). This 
flash EEPROM may be understood as what is similar in 
significance to the flash memory in the present specification. 
The flash memory is designed so that data 
can be made reprogrammable electrically by erasing/writing. 
As in the case of EPROM (Electrically Programmable 
Read Only Memory), one memory cell in the 
flash memory may be formed of one transistor. Therefore, 
the number of transistors in the memory cell of 
the flash memory is reducible in comparison with such 
an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read 
Only Memory) that one memory cell has a memory transistor 
of MNOS (Metal Nitride Oxide Silicon) and a  
 
selection transistor. The flash memory functions so 
that a plurality of memory cells as a whole or a block 
of memory cells therein are erasable electrically and 
collectively. While the flash memory like this is 
actually assembled in a system, the data stored therein 
is rendered reprogammable a desired number of times. Japanese Laid-opened Patent Publication No. 161469 
/1989 discloses a microcomputer with EPROM (Erasable 
and Programmable Read Only Memory) as a programmable 
non-volatile memory loaded on a single semiconductor 
chip. The data stored in the on-chip EPROM in such a 
microcomputer is made erasable by ultraviolet ray 
irradiation. As a result, the data stored in EPROM of 
the microcomputer becomes unerasable after the semiconductor 
chip is sealed in a package to make it impossible 
to irradiate the package with ultraviolet 
rays, that is, after the package has been assembled or 
installed in a system. In this sense, the microcomputer may be 
called a one-time programmable (hereinafter simply 
called "OTP") microcomputer. The user of the microcomputer 
performs the write operation by connecting 
the on-chip EPROM to a write unit such as an EPROM 
writer using a socket adaptor before assembling the 
microcomputer on a circuit board. With respect to a microcomputer incorporating 
EPROM, however, writing to the EPROM can be
