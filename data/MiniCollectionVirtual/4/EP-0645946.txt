<ABSTRACT>
A burner head for plasma spray guns has essentially one cathode body (1), one anode body (3) and one insulating body (2) located in between which electrically insulates the two bodies (1, 3) from one another. A cathode arrangement (4) is inserted into the cathode body (1), and an anode nozzle (5) is inserted into the anode body (3), both the cathode arrangement (4) and the anode nozzle (5) being transverse with respect to the longitudinal axis (15) of the burner head. Cooling channels (6) pass through the cathode body (1) and the anode body (3) in order to cool the burner head, these cooling channels (6) forming an annular channel (61) in the region of the anode nozzle (5), so that the cooling medium flows around the anode nozzle (5). In order to be able to dispense with seals in the region of the cooling channel (6), which passes around the anode nozzle (5) in the form of the annular channel (61), the anode nozzle (5) is permanently integrated in the anode body (3). The seals (7) which are necessary for sealing of the cooling channel (6) are arranged at a distance from the anode nozzle (5) and from the cathode arrangement (4) respectively in the region in which the cooling channel (6) changes over from one body to the other body (1, 2, 3), as a result of which they are thermally not subject to very high stresses. A burner head designed in such a way allows improved coating performance to be achieved over a longer period of time than in the past.

A burner head for plasma spray guns which has a cathode 
body (1), an anode body (3), as well as an insulating body (2) 

interposed between them, electrically insulating the two bodies

a cathode arrangement (4) into the cathode body (1) and an anode 
nozzle (5) into the anode body (3), in each case transversely to 

the longitudinal axis (15) of the burner head, in which arrangement 

the cathode body (1) and the anode body (3) are traversed 
by cooling duct sections (6) loaded by a liquid cooling medium, 

which form an annular duct (61) in the zone of the anode nozzle

with reference to the flow of the cooling medium, that the anode 
nozzle (5) is fixedly inserted into the anode body (3) without 

the use of sealing elements, and that the sealing elements (7) 
are arranged in the transition zone of the cooling duct sections
