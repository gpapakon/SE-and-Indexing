<ABSTRACT>
According to this technique, the vibrations (D) generated by an unbalance are detected and are processed (U, O, M), two satellites (30a, 30b) are displaced (71) in order to create a counter-unbalance, the position (72) of each satellite is detected and they are positioned in the position in which they were placed when the intensity and phase differences of the unbalance and counter-unbalance are less than predetermined set-point values, so as dynamically to balance the part in rotation. Application in particular to turbine alternator group shaft lines of very high power electricity power stations.

Apparatus for dynamically balancing during rotation
an energy-converting rotating machine designed to rotate about an axis (Δ)

and having a main shaft (A) in several sections joined by couplings (J)
and supported in bearings (P) and liable to develop an unbalance,

characterised in that it comprises at least one circular track (10) coaxial
with the axis (Δ), locating means (20) for holding this track fixed relative

to the axis (Δ), at least two balancing masses (30) carried by this track
(10) in a manner allowing them to be shifted, retaining means (40)

associated with the masses and holding the track (10) and masses (30) in
such a way that they cannot become separated radially, motors (50) each

connected to one of the masses (30) for shifting them relative to the track
(10), a supply (60) for the motors (50) and a control (70) for acting on the

supply (60) of each of the motors (50) for the purpose of shifting the
masses (30) separately or possibly in unison in a manner such as to

generate in rotation an opposing unbalance cancelling out the unbalance
which has arisen and in that the locating means (20) of the apparatus hold

the track (10) against at least one coupling (J) and in that the vibration
detectors (D) are placed on at least one coupling (J) and at least one

bearing (P).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that
the track (10) comprises a ring (11) with a flange (111) parallel to the axis

(Δ) and a rolling track (12) on the inside face of the flange (111) parallel
to the axis (Δ).
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that
each mass (30) comprises a carriage (31), wheels (32) carrying the 

carriage (31) and resting on the rolling track (12) and a driving
mechanism (33) coupled to the motor (50) to rotate the wheels (32).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that
the driving mechanism (33) comprises at least one pinion (331) connected

for mutual rotation to at least one wheel (32) and at least one endless
screw or worm (332) engaging the pinion (331) and driven by the motor

(50).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that the supply (60) comprises at least one conducting

strip (51) insulated from and carried by the inside face of the flange (111)
of the ring (11) parallel to the axis (Δ) and at least one tongue (62)

designed to slide in contact with the strip (61) and mounted on each mass
(30).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the control (70) comprises a generator (71) of

instructions for controlling the shifting of the masses (30) and at least one
pick-up (72) for the position of each of the masses (30).
Apparatus according to claims 6, characterised in that
the control (70) is connected to at least one detector (D) of vibrations of

the axis (Δ) and to a unit (U) for processing data for, as a function of the
vibrations detected and of the positions of the masses picked up, causing

displacement of the masses in a manner such as to generate during
rotation an opposing unbalance to cancel out the unbalance which has

arisen.
