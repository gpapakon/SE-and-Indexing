<ABSTRACT>
An HBT includes an MQB (60) between a base (54) 
and a collector (53) as a part of the collector. The MQB (60) has an 

energy band structure in which the height of the effective 
potential barrier of the MQB increases in 

steps from the base (54) to the collector (53). Therefore, an 
electric field in a region of the collector in the vicinity 

of the base-collector interface is relaxed and intervalley 
scattering of electron is suppressed, whereby reduction in 

electron mobility due to the intervalley scattering is 
suppressed, reducing the collector transit time of electron.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heterojunction bipolar 
transistors (hereinafter referred to as HBTs) and, more 
particularly, to collector structures of HBTs. Figure 6 is a sectional view illustrating a 
conventional n-p-n type GaAs HBT. In the figure, reference 
numeral 51 designates a semi-insulating GaAs substrate. An 
n⁺ type GaAs collector contact layer 52 is disposed on the 
GaAs substrate 51. An n type GaAs collector layer 53 is 
disposed on a part of the collector contact layer 52. A p⁺ 
type GaAs base layer 54 is disposed on the collector layer 
53. An n type Al0.3Ga0.7As emitter layer 55 is disposed on 
a part of the base layer 54. An emitter electrode 58 is 
disposed on the emitter layer 55. Base electrodes 57 are 
disposed on the base layer 54 at opposite sides of the 
emitter layer 55. Collector electrodes 56 are disposed on 
the collector contact layer 52 at opposite sides of the 
collector layer 53. Reference numeral 59 designates 
insulating regions formed by ion implantation. Figure 7 is an energy band diagram of the HBT of figure 
6 during operation. In the figure, the same reference 
numerals as in figure 6 designate the same parts. A description is given of the operation. In figure 7,  
 
a bias voltage VBE is applied between the emitter layer 55 
and the base layer 54, and a bias voltage VCB is applied 
between the base layer 54 and the collector layer 53. 
Electrons flow from the emitter layer 55 through the base 
layer 54 to the collector layer 53. Holes flow from the 
base layer 54 to the emitter layer 55. In this HBT, the 
bias voltage VBE controls the flows of electrons and holes. In this conventional n-p-n GaAs HBT, since the 
collector layer 53 usually comprises n type GaAs, when the 
bias voltage VCB is applied between the base layer 54 and 
the collector layer 53 during the operation, a strong 
electric field is applied to the interface between the base 
layer and the collector layer. The electric field causes 
intervalley scattering of electrons, whereby the electron 
mobility is reduced and the collector transit time is 
increased. As a result, the operating speed of the HBT is 
reduced. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
high-speed HBT with reduced collector transit time of 
electrons. Other objects and advantages of the present invention 
will become apparent from the detailed description given 
hereinafter; it should be understood, however, that the 
detailed description and specific embodiment are given by  
 
way of illustration only since
