<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
thiazolidine derivatives and salts thereof. More specifically, 
this invention relates to thiazolidine 
derivatives or salts thereof which have blood-sugar 
lowering action and blood-lipid lowering action and are 
useful as hypoglycemic agents and anti-hyperlipidemia 
agents, preparation processes thereof, pharmaceutical 
compositions containing one or more of the compounds 
and therapeutic methods for diabetes. As synthetic therapeutic agents for diabetes 
which show blood-sugar lowering action, sulfonylurea 
preparations have commonly been used to date. Their 
use, however, requires very careful control because 
they may cause hypoglycemic symptoms or induce drug 
resistance. In recent years, development of 
hypoglycemic agents is therefore under way as substitutes 
for the above sulfonyl urea preparations.  
 
Among them, interested are those capable of enhancing 
the insulin sensitivity at peripheries and showing 
blood-sugar lowering action. Effects available from these agents, however, are 
still not satisfactory and moreover, their side effects 
cannot be considered to have been reduced fully. Further, 
as there are many diabetics who have also developed 
hyperlipidemia, there is an outstanding demand for 
the development of pharmaceuticals having both blood-sugar 
lowering action and blood-lipid lowering action. In view of the foregoing circumstances, the present 
inventors have carried out an extensive investigation. 
As a result, it has been found that certain 
novel, specific thiazolidine derivatives and salts 
thereof have both the above actions, leading to the 
completion of the invention. The present invention therefore provides a 
thiazolidine derivative represented by the following 
formula (1):  wherein R¹, R² and R³ may be the same or different and 
individually represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, 
a lower alkyl group or lower alkoxyl group which may be 
substituted by one or more halogen atom(s), a hydroxyl 
group, a nitro group, an amino group, a lower acylamino 
group, a mono- or di-lower alkylamino group, a carboxyl 
group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group, a cyano group, a 
2-oxazolyl group, a thiazolidine-2,4-dion-5-ylidene-methyl 
group or a thiazolidine-2,4-dion-5-ylmethyl 
group and R¹ and R² may be coupled together to form an 
alkylene chain -(CH₂)p- wherein p stands for 3, 4 or 5 
or an alkylenedioxy chain -O(CH₂)qO- wherein q stands 
for 1, 2 or 3, thereby forming a ring; R⁴ and R⁵ may be 
the same or different and individually
