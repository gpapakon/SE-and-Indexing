<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricant 
composition for hot plastic working containing graphite. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
graphite-containing lubricant composition for hot plastic 
working, having an excellent inhibiting effect against 
carburizing phenomenon, which often occurs when the 
graphite-containing lubricant is applied to a metal 
material. When a metal material is subjected to a hot 
plastic working, for example, hot rolling, extrusion or 
forging, a lubricant is used to decrease friction, for 
example between a die for forging and the metal material 
to be worked, to prevent galling or seizing and to render 
the plastic working easy. Generally, the lubricant is classified into two 
groups, namely a graphite-type lubricant and a 
nongraphite-type lubricant. The graphite-type lubricant comprises graphite 
as a principal component. The nongraphite-type lubricant 
comprises, as a principal component, boron nitride, 
silicate or calcium carbonate. Each of the graphite type 
and nongraphite type lubricants contains a binder 
consisting of an inorganic compound such as boric acid or 
an organic polymeric compound such as a water-soluble 
resin, and is applied in the form of an aqueous liquid to 
the inside or outside surface of the die by way of, for 
example, spraying. As regards the working environment, the 
nongraphite-type lubricant is preferable over the black 
graphite-type lubricant, and thus has recently been 
widely studied. However, the nongraphite-type lubricant  
 
is inferior to the graphite-type lubricant with respect 
to the lubricity. Therefore, the graphite-type lubricant 
is still widely employed for various uses. Nevertheless, the graphite type lubricant has a 
disadvantageous in that since the graphite-type lubricant 
comprises graphite as an essential component that causes 
the resultant lubricant to exhibit an excellent 
lubricating effect, the occurrence of an undesirable 
carburizing phenomenon on the worked metal material is 
unavoidable due to the graphite. This carburizing phenomenon greatly affects the 
worked metal material, especially when the metal material 
has a high upper limit of solid solubility of carbon at 
hot working temperatures, for example, a high alloy steel 
material is hot worked in the austenite state thereof. 
Namely, the carburizing phenomenon sometimes promotes 
undesirable hardening or cracking of the metal material, 
and thus can promote poor results in the subsequent 
forming process or can promote lowered
