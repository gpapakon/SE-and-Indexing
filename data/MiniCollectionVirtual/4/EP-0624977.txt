<ABSTRACT>
In a digital signal recording and reproducing apparatus 
for recording on a track of a recording medium a recording 

block composed of digital video data and a recording block 
of AUX data composed of auxiliary information data, if there 

is an uncorrectable error in data reproduced from the recording 
medium, the presence of error in the video data in 

the recording block is identified by setting a specific bit 
sequence as STATUS information at the beginning of the 

recording block. In the AUX data divided into PACKs, a bit 
sequence including a bit sequence of STATUS information is 

inserted in the header at the beginning of each PACK to 
identify the presence of error in the corresponding PACK.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital signal processing 
method in the event of an error in reproduction, in a 
digital signal recording and reproducing apparatus for 
recording digitized video signal data together with their 
auxiliary information data. As the consumer video appliances are enhanced in picture 
quality and digitized recently, recording and reproducing 
apparatus using digital recording, instead of the conventional 
analog recording, has been put in practical use. 
As a typical example of such digital signal recording and 
reproducing apparatus, a digital recording video tape recorder  
 
(VTR) (digital VTR) is known. In the professional 
field, digital VTRs of D1, D2, D3 standard have been commercialized. 
For consumer use, for example, a prototype of 
digital VTR of bit rate reduction processing of video data 
was introduced by C. YAMAMITSU et al. "An Experimental Study 
on a Home-Use Digital VTR," IEEE Transaction on Consumer 
Electronics, Vol. 35, No. 3, August 1989, pp. 450-457, M. 
YONEDA et al. "An Experimental Digital VCR with New DCT-Based 
Bit Rate Reduction System," IEEE Transaction on Consumer 
Electronics, Vol. 37, No. 3, August 1991, pp. 275-282. In digital VTR, video data is divided into units of 
specified size, and SYNC and ID are added to each of the 
units to form a sync block. The sync blocks are recorded on 
a track on a recording medium. Information for distinguishing 
the content of the recorded data and information multiplexed 
in the vertical blanking period are recorded in a 
different area from the video data recording area on the 
track as AUX data. Herein, the AUX data is processed in a 
PACK unit. PACK is used in sub-code processing of the 
digital audio tape recorder (DAT), and is described in The  
 
DAT Conference Standard Digital Audio Taperecorder System, 
June 1987, pp. 70-81. At the beginning of the PACK, the 
header indicating the content of the data inserted in the 
PACK is added, and the content of the data can be distinguished 
by detecting the header. In digital recording, the processed data is recorded as 
a data sequence of 0 and 1, but if 0 and 1 are detected by 
mistake due to distortion of the reproduced waveform, it results 
in a data error. In this case, if the error rate is 
less than a specified value, error of reproduced data can be 
completely corrected by the error correction technology, and 
therefore by adequately setting the correction capability to 
the error rate of reproduced data, completely correct data 
can be

A digital data processing apparatus to be used in a 
digital signal recording and reproducing apparatus for 

recording on a track of a recording medium a first recording 
block composed of digital principal information data and a 

second recording block composed of auxiliary information 
data, comprising: 

   error correction means for correcting an error of data 
reproduced from the recording medium; 

   first bit sequence multiplexing means for multiplexing 
a first bit sequence at a specified position of the first 

recording block containing an error not correctable by the 
error correction means; 

   second bit sequence multiplexing means for multiplexing 
a second bit sequence including the first bit sequence at a 

specified position of the second recording block containing 
an error not correctable by the error correction means; 

   first error processing means for processing the error 
of the digital principal information data in the first recording 

block on the basis of the first bit sequence; and
 

   second error processing means for processing the error 
of the auxiliary information data in the second recording 

block on the basis of the second bit sequence. 
A digital data processing apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein the digital principal information data in the first 

recording block is encoded video data. 
A digital data processing apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein the first bit sequence multiplexing means inserts 

the first bit sequence into the beginning of the first recording 
block. 
A digital data processing apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein the second bit sequence multiplexing means divides 

the second recording block into specific units, and inserts 
the second bit sequence into the beginning of each of the 

units. 
A digital data processing apparatus of claim 1, 
wherein an error is detected, if there is an error in the 

first recording block, by inserting the second bit sequence 
at specified position of the first recording block, and 

detecting the second bit sequence in both the first and 
 

second recording blocks.
