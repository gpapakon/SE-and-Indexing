<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to promoter elements from human type I transglutaminase (TGase I) genes for controlled gene expression of both human TGase I and heterologous proteins. These promoter elements permit tissue-specific expression of genes, e.g. for use in human gene therapy and for testing pharmaceutical agents with artificial skin. Additionally, the subject promoter elements can provide differential regulation under physiological conditions or in the presence of exogenously added factors including calcium and retinoic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to promoter
elements from the human type I transglutaminase (TGase
I) gene for controlled gene expression of both human
TGase I and heterologous proteins. These promoter
elements permit tissue-specific expression of genes,
e.g. for use in human gene therapy and for testing
pharmaceutical agents with skin equivalents.
Additionally, the subject promoter elements can provide
differential regulation under physiological conditions
or in the presence of exogenously added factors
including calcium and retinoic acid.Transglutaminases are calcium-dependent
enzymes which catalyze acyl transfer reactions that lead
to the amination of proteins with small primary amines
or the crosslinking of proteins by the formation of ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine
transpeptide bonds. This crosslinking
activity typically results in the covalent joining of
soluble proteins into large chemically, enzymatically
and mechanically resistant polymers with diverse
biological functions.Several classes of transglutaminase exist and
form a family of genes. The "a" subunit of factor XIII
(XIIIa) participates in blood clot formation by
crosslinking fibrin. Factor XIIIa is a soluble protein
in the plasma and in placenta; it is also know as plasma
TGase. TGase I is a differentiation marker for
keratinocytes and plays a role in formation of the
cornifying envelope in epidermal keratinocytes. TGase I
is predominantly membrane-bound, and has been variously
identified in the literature as particulate TGase,
epidermal TGase, and TGase K. TGase II is ubiquitously 
distributed in the cytosol. The physiological role of
TGase II is not well understood. This enzyme is also
known as tissue TGase, liver TGase, intracellular TGase,
soluble TGase and TGase C. Band 4.2 protein also
belongs to the TGase gene family although this protein
lacks transglutaminase activity.TGase I gene expression appears to be limited
to the terminally differentiating keratinocyte invivo
and invitro. In these cells, the formation of an
insoluble protective structure, the cell envelope, just
beneath the plasma membrane is associated with increased
crosslinking activity of TGase, which in turn is
correlated with an increased level of TGase I mRNA
[Polakowska etal. (1991) J. Invest.Dermat.96:285-288].
TGase I expression, as well as terminal
differentiation, are regulated by several environmental
factors of which Ca2+ and retinoic acid (RA) appear to
have the most profound effect. Hence, TGase I provides
a convenient marker for keratinocyte differentiation.A cDNA
