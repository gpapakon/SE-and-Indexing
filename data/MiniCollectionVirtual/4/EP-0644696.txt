<ABSTRACT>
A motion adaptive spatial filtering method is employed as 
a prefilter in an image coding apparatus, which processes the 

temporal band-limitation of a video signal without temporal 
aliasing by using a spatial filter having a band-limitation 

characteristic according to a desired temporal cutoff 
frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for the 
temporal filtering of video signals; and, in particular, to a 
motion adaptive spatial filtering method for use in an image 
coding apparatus, capable of achieving a temporal band 
limitation without incurring temporal aliasing effects and 
thereby obtaining an improved picture quality. In digital television systems such as video-telephone, 
teleconference and high definition television systems, an 
image coding apparatus has been used to reduce a large volume 
of data defining each frame of video signals by way of 
employing various data compression techniques, for example, a 
transform coding using a Discrete Cosine Transform, and a 
motion compensation coding for reducing the temporal 
relationship between two successive frames. In order to effectively carry out the data compression  
 
process, most real-time image coding apparatus available in 
the art employ various filters as a part of a front-end 
processing for the filtering and frame rate reduction. These 
filters serve to eliminate or alleviate temporal noises and 
perform band limitation to thereby improve the picture quality 
and coding efficiency. One of such prior art apparatus is disclosed in an 
article by Eric Dubois et al., "Noise Reduction in Image 
Sequences Using Motion-Compensated Temporal Filtering ", IEEE 
Transactions on Communications, COM-32, No. 7 (July, 1984), 
which utilizes a nonlinear recursive temporal filter to reduce 
noise components which may arise in an initial signal 
generation and handling operation. This temporal filter 
employs a motion compensation technique to perform the 
filtering in the temporal domain along the trajectory of a 
motion to thereby reduce noise components in moving areas 
without modifying the details of an image. Another prior art apparatus is described in an article by 
Wen-Hsiung Chen et al., "Recursive Temporal Filtering and 
Frame Rate Reduction for Image Coding", IEEE Journal on 
Selected Areas in Communications, SAC-5 (August, 1987), which 
also employs a recursive temporal filter to perform a 
recursive filtering and frame rate reduction. This filter 
when applied in the temporal domain can smooth out frame-to-frame 
input noises and improve the picture quality. U. S. Patent No. 4,694,342 issued to K. J. Klees  
 
provides an apparatus which utilizes a spatial filter that can 
function both recursively and non-recursively for removing 
noises from a video image while substantially preserving the 
details thereof. This filter

values are not greater that L and M, respectively; positive 
integers L and M represent the respective lengths of a 2-dimensional 

filter hs(·).
