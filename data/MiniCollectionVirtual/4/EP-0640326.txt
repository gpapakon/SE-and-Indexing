<ABSTRACT>
The element (20) according to the invention comprises a biodegradable body which is inserted, before or during implantation of an orthopaedic prosthesis (1), into a recess (2) in the prosthesis (1) in such a way that the rigidity of the prosthesis is increased. The element (20) brings about a mechanical connection between the shell segments (1a, 1b, 1c), so that the element (20) exerts a supporting function reducing the elastic properties and the mobility of the outer shell (1). The ability of the biodegradable element (20) to transmit forces is progressively reduced after the implantation, so that the outer shell (1) of the artificial acetabular cup has increasingly great elastic properties in accordance with the mechanical properties due to its design. After a specific period of time after implantation the biodegradable element (20) is degraded to such an extent that it can no longer transmit forces.

<CLAIMS>
An orthopaedic prosthesis (1,10) is provided with a recess
(2,11), characterised in that a biodegradable element (20,21,22)

is arranged positively connected or form-lockingly for
temporarily increasing the rigidity of the prosthesis (1,10),

and where the bio-degradable element (20,21,22) gradually loses
its load bearing ability so that some time after implantation,

the prosthesis (1,10) has increasing elastic properties.
An orthopaedic prosthesis according to claim 1, where the
bio-degradable element (20,21,22) has a simple coherent shape

which is adjusted to the prosthesis (1,10) recess (2,11).
An orthopaedic prosthesis according to any of the above
claims, where the bio-degradable element (22) and likewise the

prosthesis recess (11) have mutually adjusted connecting means
(11a,22a) so as to load the bio-degradable element (20,21,22)

with both push and pull forces.
An orthopaedic prosthesis according to any of the above
claims, where the bio-degradable element (20,21,22) is comprised

of a biologically reabsorbable polymer.
An orthopaedic prosthesis according to claim 4, where the
biologically reabsorbable polymer is selected from a group

comprising polyesteramide, polydioxanon, poly lactic acid,
polyglycol acid, polycaprolacton and their co-polymers.
