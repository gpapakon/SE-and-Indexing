<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer label for application to a 
plastic container by in-mould labelling during the 

blow moulding of the plastic container which comprises
 

   a non-cellular layer which is heat bondable at 
moulding temperature to the outer surface of the 

plastic container, and
 

   a cellular layer compatible with the inner layer 
and heat bonded thereto. 
Preferably, the cellular layer is an intermediate 
layer and there is an also an outer non-cellular layer 

compatible with the intermediate cellular layer and 
heat bonded thereto. Plastic containers having such 

labels thereon can be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to labels for plastic 
containers, to the application of labels to plastic 
containers, particularly by in-mould labelling during 
the blow moulding of the container, and to plastic 
containers having labels applied thereto. In the use of plastic containers, it becomes 
necessary to apply labels. It has been found that 
applying the labels during the moulding process reduces 
costs of manufacture and produces an attractive 
container. More specifically, when a hollow parison 
or preform is expanded against the surface of the 
mould having a label on a side wall of the mould cavity 
so that when the plastic is expanded, it causes an 
adhesive on the label to be heated and thereby adhere 
the label to the container. One common type of label 
that is used is a paper label. However, the use of 
such a label has inherent problems in that when the 
plastic container cools, the plastic and paper have 
different rates of shrinkage and, as a result, the 
paper wrinkles and stresses occur in the adhesive. 
Another problem with the use of paper labels is that 
any rejected containers cannot be reprocessed until the 
paper label is removed. It has there fore been common to 
discard the entire container or, at most, cut off the 
neck of the container and discard the remainder. US- A- 3 108 850 and US- A- 3 207 822 discuss 
the use of plastic labels without adhesive. US- A-3 
108 850 is considered the nearest prior art for the presently claimed invention, and contemplates the use of an insulator comprising 
a paper layer or plastic layer between the mould and 
the plastic parison. The insulating part is connected 
to the label by either a temporary readily strippable 
connection for quick removal or a relatively permanent 
connection so that the insulation remains with the label  
 
on the completed container to form the decorated outer surface. 
US-A-3 207 822 contemplates a plastic label made of a material 
similar to that used in making the bottle that becomes bonded to 
the container by the heat and pressure of blowing the container. 
US-A-3 207 822 also contemplates coarsely roughening the surface 
of the mould to facilitate bonding of the label to the container. 
As far as is known to the present Applicant, such efforts were not 
commercially successful and, at the present time, it is believed 
that adhesive is used in all labels wherein the labels are applied 
by the in-moulding process. Reference is also made to US-A-4 049 147, which discloses a 
tubular two-layer label (having a foamed

<CLAIMS>
A method of labelling a plastics container 
(10) which comprises positioning a multi-layer label 

(L) in a mould cavity, positioning a hot parison at 
moulding temperature adjacent the cavity, and expanding 

the parison by fluid pressure against the side wall of 
the mould to form a container (10) and bond the inner 

layer (15) of the label to the outer surface (16) of 
the container (10), wherein the multi-layer label (L) 

is a non-tubular multi-layer lable (L) 
consisting of only two coextruded layers comprising: 


as the inner layer 
a non-cellular plastic layer (15); and 
as the outer layer a cellular plastic layer (18) compatible with the 
non-cellular layer (15) without adhesive and bonded 

thereto. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
label is heat bondable at moulding temperature to the 

outer surface of the plastic container (10). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the cellular plastic layer (18) is heat bonded 

to the non-cellular plastic layer (15). 
A method as claimed in any of calims 1 to 3, 
wherein the cellular layer (18) comprises the major 

portion of the total thickness of the lable (4). 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein said layers comprise a material selected from 

the group of olefins. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the layers (15, 18) of the label comprise 

polyethylene. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1-6, wherein the 
cellular layer (18) has a roughened surface (20)  

 
adjacent the non-cellular layer (15) providing paths 

for escape of air which could become entrapped between 
the container (10) and label during moulding. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the non-cellular layer has thickness of about 

0.0127mm (0.5 mil) and the cellular layer (18) has a 
thickness of about 0.127mm (5 mils). 
A plastics container (10) having a multilayer 
label (L) adapted by a method as claimed in any of 

claims 1 to 8. 
A plastics container (10) as claimed in claim 
9, wherein the container comprises a material selected 

from the group of olefins. 
A plastics container (10) as claimed in claim 
10, wherein the container comprises polyethylene.
