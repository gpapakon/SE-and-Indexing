Locking device for supports (40) which are arranged on an 
undercarriage or support frame and which can be extended, 

swung out or telescoped preferably laterally from a retracted 
transport position into an extended operating position, in 

particular for support legs on travelling machines, with a 
locking bolt (14) which can be displaced in a guide sleeve 

(12) connected to the frame and arranged transversely to the 
extension direction (50) of the support (40) between a locking 

position and an unlocking position and which is pretensioned 
in the direction of the locking position under the action of a 

spring (22) and with an actuating member (24) which displaces 
the locking bolt (14) between the locking position and the 

unlocking position, characterized in that the actuating 
member (24) which can be swung or displaced relative to the 

guide sleeve (12) between two end positions, rests against a 
driving element (30) arranged on the locking bolt (14) and 

acts on said driving element with a displacement of the 
locking bolt (14), in that an engagement or guide member (42) 

is rigidly arranged on the extendable part of the support (40) 
and has in each case one locking surface (46, 48) which 

strikes the locking bolt (14) located in its locking position 
in the transport position and in the support position of the 

support as well as a lead cam (44) which extends in the region 

between the two locking surfaces (46, 48), acts on the locking 
bolt (14) and displaces the latter between its unlocking 

position and a release position, in which connection the 
driving element (30) can be lifted off or uncoupled in the 

release position from the actuating member (24, 26) which is 
in its end position corresponding to the unlocking position 

and the uncoupled actuating member (24, 26) can be moved 
automatically into its end position corresponding to the 

locking position.  
 
Locking device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the actuating member (24, 26) has a link element (26) 

which is preferably actuable by means of a lever (24), in that 
the link element (26) has two cam or engagement sections (26', 

26'') which are connected to one another by an actuating cam 
and against which the driving element (30) rests in the 

locking position and in the unlocking position of the locking 
bolt (14) under the action of the spring (22) and with the 

establishing of a holding or engagement connection and that 
the driving element (40) can be lifted from the link element 

(26) in the release position of the locking bolt (14) and the 
actuating member can in this case be automatically swung back 

into its end position corresponding to the locking position 
preferably under the influence of gravity. 
Locking device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the link element (26) is mounted eccentrically and 

pivotally round a horizontal shaft (27) connected to the 
sleeve with respect to its two cam or engagement sections 

(26', 26'') which are preferably orientated perpendicularly to 
one another and in that the lever (24) points substantially 

vertically downwardly in its end position corresponding to the 
locking position and is directed substantially horizontally in 

its end position corresponding to the unlocking position. 
Locking device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the locking bolt (14) protrudes on the 

side of the support (40) beyond the guide sleeve (12) and that 
the locking surfaces of the engagement and guide member (42) 

which face away from one another are directed parallel to the 
direction of displacement of the locking bolt (14) and, in the 

locking position, come laterally against the locking bolt (14) 
and in that the lead cam (44) of the engagement and guide 

member (42) acts against the free end surface of the locking 
bolt (14).  

 
Locking device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the plate-shaped link element (26) is 

mounted between two bearing plates (28) connected to the 
sleeve and in that the driving element (30) is designed as an 

arm which is preferably in the form of a straight pin and 
engages in the region between the bearing plates (28). 
Locking device according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the two cam or engagement sections (26', 

26'') are designed as straight edges of the plate-shaped link 
element (26) which are arranged perpendicularly to one 

another. 
Locking device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that in the rear part of the sleeve, 

preferably in the region of a rear sleeve arm (32), there is 
arranged a transverse bore (34) for receiving a safety plug, 

the bore being blocked by the locking bolt (12) in the 
unlocking position and in the release position and being 

released in the locking position.
