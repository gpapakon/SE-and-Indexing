<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to t head of a golf club used
for striking the golf ball between the teeing ground and the
putting green; generally referred to as a "golf club".The principal skill in accurate striking of the golf
ball is to correctly contact the ball on that point on the
striking face of the club; generally referred to as the
"sweet spot".A presently known golf club head is of the common blade
shape having an elongated striking face and a thickness of
only about half an inch consistent throughout its length.
The thickness of said striking face may vary from the top to
the bottom or sole of the club head.Such a golf club head has the mass, or general overall
head weight, evenly distributed over the elongated length of
the portion located directly behind the striking face.Alternatively, there have been developments in iron
golf head technology which have provided peripheral
weighting of the head mass by constructing the head in such
a way as locating the major part of the head material,
usually stainless steel, around the perimeter of the head
shape. One such design is shown in US Patent No.D276644.It has generally been tested and agreed that it is
desirable for the club head to strike the ball at the "sweet
spot", which is accepted by technologists in the industry as
having a larger area if the peripheral weighting head design
is used. The design of iron head shown in US Patent
No.D276644 is considered to be the most improved design yet
devised to provide an iron golf head with an enlarged "sweet 
spot".It will be appreciated that considerable skill is
required to accurately make contact with the golf ball at
the "sweet spot", or centre of the mass of the club head at
the forward portion; generally referred to as the "striking
face", since the mass, or general overall headweight is
spread throughout the length, or back portion of the
striking face.The golf club head with the perimeter weighted cavity
back head shape such as that shown in US Patent No.D276644
has a cavity located behind the striking face at that point
where the club head is required to make contact with the
golf ball. In this case, the actual mass or head weight is
generally located around the rear edge or perimeter of the
golf head forming what is generally referred to as a "cavity
back" golf club head.It will be appreciated that the cavity back design of
golf club head provides a larger sweet spot than would
normally be provided in the case of the conventional blade
shaped golf club head. However, it will be realised that
because

<CLAIMS>
An iron type golf club having a head with a striking area, an insert being positioned
at the striking area of the head to provide a striking face, the head not including the insert

being defined as a rest of the head, said rest of the head being metallic, 
characterised in that

the club is a cavity back iron type golf club which is peripherally weighted, and 
in that
 the
insert and thus the striking face is made of a material different to the rest of the head, wherein a part of the said rest of the head is positioned behind

the insert at the striking face of the head, the part of said rest
of the head being situated throughout the length of the insert in

such a way as to provide a backing wall for the insert.
An iron type golf club as claimed in claim 1, wherein the insert at the striking area
of the head is positioned at the sweet spot of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in either claim 1 or 2 where in the insert at the
striking area of the head is made of non-metallic material.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the insert at the
striking area of the head is made partly from metallic material.
An iron type golf club as claimed in claim 4 wherein the insert is made of a metal
different to the metal of the rest of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the head has a
front, and the insert at the striking area of the head is securely fixed within a cavity provided

in the front of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the insert at the
striking area of the head is positioned on the horizontal axis containing the centre of mass

of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the mass of the
head is substantially located around the perimeter of the sweet spot. 
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the part behind the insert is
made of metal.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the head has a
back, and an insert is provided in a cavity in the back of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in claim 10 wherein the insert in the cavity in the
back of the head is connected to the insert at the striking area of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in claim 11
wherein the insert in the back of the head is connected to the insert at the striking

area through a part of said rest of the head positioned behind the insert at the striking
area of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the head is
injection moulded.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said rest of the
head has a varied thickness along its length
 and/or width.
An iron type golf club as claimed in claim 14 wherein the perimeter of the said rest
of the head has a thickness greater than the center portion of said rest of the head.
An iron type golf club as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the insert at the
striking area of the head is surrounded on all four sides by said rest of the head.
