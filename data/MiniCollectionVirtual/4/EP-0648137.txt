<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a new, superior inner cannula (10) for insertion into a tracheostomy tube. The inner cannula according to the present invention is formed of a material that allows the inner cannula to have a smooth lumen, while avoiding kinking or collapse when inserted into the tracheostomy tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Inner Cannula For Tracheostomy TubeBackgroundTracheostomy tubes are normally inserted into the trachea of a patient through an opening cut in the front of the throat. The tracheostomy tube is generally designed to include a relatively straight proximal and distal end portion connected by a curved central portion. Alternatively, the tracheostomy tube may be formed entirely in an arced configuration.The distal end portion of the tracheostomy tube extends down into the trachea, while the proximal end portion extends through the cut in the throat. An inflatable cuff may be included around the distal end portion and may be used to seal the space between the tube and the surrounding wall of the trachea, so that all ventilation occurs through the tracheostomy tube.During use, mucous and other secretions collect and dry within the tracheostomy tube causing obstruction of the ventilation path. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically remove the tracheostomy tube for cleaning, followed by reinsertion into the patient's trachea. This removal and reinsertion is traumatic to the patient, and increases the risk of injury to the trachea and surrounding membranes. In addition, a skilled practitioner is required to administer the procedure.To overcome the disadvantages of removal and reinsertion, it has been proposed to include a second, removable, tube or cannula which can be inserted into the tracheostomy tube. This inner cannula may easily be removed from the tracheostomy tube and cleaned or replaced by a new inner cannula, without disturbing the tracheostomy tube. The inner cannula must be flexible enough to be 

inserted into the proximal end of the tracheostomy tube and then pushed around the curved central portion into the distal end. However, the inner cannula must also be rigid enough to avoid collapse or kinking in the curved portion, which would restrict or close off the ventilation pathway.One type of inner cannula is described in US Patent 3,443,564 to Oehmig, and includes a spirally wound wire along a portion of its length which will correspond to the curved portion of a tracheostomy tube when inserted. This inner cannula has several disadvantages including the lack of a solid wall where the wound wire exists. This is disadvantageous because gaps will be present between convolutions of the wire, which will gather mucous and other secretions. Also, such an inner cannula is relatively expensive, so as not to be suitable as a disposable unit. Therefore, this inner cannula must be cleaned every time it is
