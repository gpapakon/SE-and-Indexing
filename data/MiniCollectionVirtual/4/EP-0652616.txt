<ABSTRACT>
A solid-state laser architecture producing a beam of extremely 
high quality 

and brightness, including a master oscillator (10) 
operating in conjunction 

with a zig-zag 
amplifier (16,30), an image relaying telescope (17) 

and a phase conjugation cell (20). One embodiment 
of the laser architecture compensates for birefringence that is 

thermally induced in the 
amplifier (16), but injects linearly polarized light into the phase 

conjugation cell (20). Another 
embodiment (19) injects circularly polarized light into the phase 

conjugation cell (20) and includes 
optical components that eliminate birefringence effects arising 

in a first pass through the 
amplifier (16,30). Optional features (26) permit 

the use of a frequency doubler 
assembly to provide 

output at twice optical frequencies, and an electro-optical 
switch or Faraday rotator (71) to 

effect polarization angle rotation if the amplifier material (16,30) 
can only be operated at one 

polarization. The zig-zag amplifier (16,30) is cooled by flow of cooling 
liquid, preferably using 

longitudinal flow to minimize temperature gradients in a vertical 
direction, and has 

cooling channel seals (50,52) disposed in dead zones that receive no 
light, to minimize optical 

damage to the seals (50,52). Light is input to the amplifier (16) 
at a near normal angle of incidence, 

to minimize polarization by reflection and to permit a polarizer (14) 
to be used to extract an 

output beam from the amplifier (16,30). Antireflective coatings (60) 
on edges and on sides of the 

amplifier (16,30) eliminate parasitic oscillations, and wedge-shaped 
windows (36) provide uniform 

pumping by eliminating gaps between diode arrays (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high brightness solid-state
laser source in accordance with the pre-characterizing
portion of claim 1. Such a laser source is known from
US-A-4,725,787.More particularly, the present invention is directed to
systems for producing laser beams of extremely high brightness.
Solid-state lasers with an average power up to 100 W (watts),
and even higher powers, are needed in a variety of military,
industrial and commercial applications, including X-ray
photolithography, laser machining and drilling, space and
underwater communication, and medical applications.The brightness of a laser beam is proportional to the
average power and is inversely proportional to the square of the
beam quality, where the beam quality is in turn defined in
relation to a diffraction-limited beam, i.e., a diffraction-limited
beam has an ideal beam quality of 1.0. A worse beam
quality of, say, 1.5 results in a brightness of 1/(1.5)2 or
44.4% of the brightness of the diffraction limited beam. Since
the brightness falls off in proportion to the square of the beam
quality, it is extremely important to control the beam quality
if high brightness is a design goal.A number of laser architectures disclosed in various prior
patents use a phase conjugated master oscillator power amplifier
(PC MOPA) configuration, but still fail to produce a desirably
bright beam, or have other drawbacks. Accordingly, there is
still a significant need for an improved solid-state laser
architecture providing excellent beam quality and, therefore, an 
extremely bright beam. The present invention satisfies this
need, as outlined in the following.According to the present invention, a high brightness solid-state
laser source is provided as described in claim 1.Preferred embodiments of that laser source are described in
the dependent claims.In the following, a preferred embodiment of the invention
is described in detail with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:
