<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color diffusion
transfer photosensitive material and, more particularly, to a
photosensitive material in which the final image formed is
materially reduced in density increase with the lapse of
time.Conventional color diffusion transfer photosensitive
materials are classified into two groups by film unit
structure as of peel-apart type and no peel-apart type. In a
photosensitive material of the peel-apart type, a light-sensitive
layer unit and a dye image-receiving layer unit are
coated on separate supports, and its photosensitive and
image-receiving elements are brought into face-to-face
contact with each other after imagewise exposure. Then, a
processing solution is spread between those elements, and
thereafter is peeled apart the dye image-receiving element.
Thus, dye images transferred to the dye image-receiving layer
are obtained.However, the material of the above-described type has
a problem such that, when the dye image-receiving element is
delaminated after the prescribed time (exceeding the time at
which the image formation is completed), dyes remaining in
the photosensitive element are further transferred to cause
color balance loss, stains on the white background and so on. As for the photosensitive materials of no peel-apart
type, on the other hand, a dye image-receiving layer and
silver halide emulsion layers are sandwiched between a
transparent support and another support. In one structure,
those layers all are coated on the transparent support; while
in another structure the dye image-receiving layer is coated
on the transparent support and the emulsion layers are coated
on the other support. Further, in order to view dye images
transferred to the image-receiving layer by reflected light,
the former structure is designed so as to have a white light-reflecting
layer between the image-receiving layer and the
emulsion layer unit, and the latter structure is designed so
that a processing composition containing a white pigment can
be spread between the image-receiving layer and the silver
halide emulsion layer unit.However, the photosensitive materials of the no peel-apart
type suffer an appreciable change in image density with
the lapse of time, because it takes a good long time for the
dyes released from the silver halide emulsion layers to
finish fixing to the image-receiving layer. In this respect,
it is desirable for them to undergo a decided improvement.As a means of solving the above-described problems,
there are disclosed a method of providing a
