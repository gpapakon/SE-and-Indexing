<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermosetting molding 
composition extremely useful, for example, as general 
molding materials for household appliances, automotive 
parts or components, various machines and electrical 
parts or components, laminate-molding materials, and 
molding materials for sheet and bulk molding processes 
for the formation of fiber-reinforced plastics. This 
invention is also concerned with a thermosetting 
expansion-forming composition useful as an expansion-forming 
material for dividing walls (partitions) in 
buildings, a heat-insulating, soundproofing or low-temperature 
shielding material for housing and transportation 
equipments, a warm material for tanks, an 
impact-resistant packaging material, or a filler. The 
term "forming" as used herein should be interpreted in 
a broad sense so that it embraces not only molding but 
also other forming techniques such as extrusion. In general, the term "thermosetting molding 
material" means a material which has been obtained by  
 
impregnating a thermosetting resin with a curing agent, 
a filler, a mold release agent, a dye or pigment, a 
thickening agent and the like as needed so that it can 
be conveniently formed into a desired shape by heating 
and pressing it as needed. Such materials are advantageous 
inter alia in that they can be directly 
formed into products of various shapes, the products so 
formed have a good surface finish, formed products of a 
desired color can be obtained by dispersing the corresponding 
dye or pigment in advance and no coating 
work is needed, so that they are useful as industrial 
materials. Known examples of the thermosetting resin 
include phenol resins, melamine resins, and unsaturated 
polyester resins. Among these molding materials, phenol resins are 
excellent in electrical insulating property and cracking 
resistance but, as their defects, are poor in 
weatherability and high-temperature discoloration 
resistance as well as arc resistance and anti-tracking 
properties, so that their applications are considerably 
limited. Melamine resins are excellent in colorability, 
surface hardness, anti-tracking properties and 
the like but exhibit insufficient flowability upon 
molding. Molded products obtained from melamine resins 
lack flexibility and have poor impact resistance and,  
 
as their defects, tend to develop seasoning cracks and 
metal insert cracks. Unsaturated polyester resins, on 
the other hand, are excellent in flexibility, water 
resistance and the like but, as their defects, lack 
he
