<CLAIMS>
Process for producing a mat for erosion protection and/or drainage
purposes, consisting of at least one filter layer and at least one three-dimensional

claw and/or distance layer having a high free volume, wherein
all layers are joined to one another and the joint of at least two layers

consists of sewn seams, 
characterized in that
 a water-permeable film,
formed from the planar state and having at least one structured surface

exhibiting hills and valleys, is used for the claw and/or distance layer, that
the claw and/or distance layer is sewn to the filter layer such that after

sewing the filter layer in the area of the sewn seams has been drawn into
the valleys of the structured surface of the claw and/or distance layer so

that the filter layer has a structured surface, wherein a first group of sewn
seams is arranged in parallel and intersects with a second group of sewn

seams arranged in parallel and the two groups of sewn seams are arranged
such that they form a check pattern.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the sewn seams have a
stitch length of 1 to 20 mm.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the sewn seams
are produced by sewing with at least one multifilament yarn.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 at
least one filter layer is a nonwoven consisting of short fibers and/or filament

yarn.
Process according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 at least one filter layer
consists of short fibers that are sewn together for reinforcement.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the
layers joined by one group of sewn seams have an overall thickness of 4 to

70 mm. 
Process according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the layers joined by one
group of sewn seams have an overall thickness of 20 to 60 mm.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the
sewn seams are produced such that they have loops protruding from at

least one of the exterior surfaces of the mat.
