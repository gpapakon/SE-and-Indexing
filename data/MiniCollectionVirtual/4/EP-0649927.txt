<ABSTRACT>
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine for fabric and knitwork with 
tension control, comprising a load-bearing structure with two 

sidepieces (10) supporting at least one drum (11) which rotates 
about a central shaft (12) and supports on its two lateral 

endpieces (11a, 11b) two series of teaseling and/or fluffing 
rollers of with-pile type (13) and against-pile type (14) arranged 

along the generators of the drum (11) with those of one series 
rotating relative to those of the other under independent drive, a 

fabric (15) to be treated passing about the teaseling and/or 
fluffing rollers (13, 14) and being fed to the machine by a driven 

feed roller (16) and extracted therefrom by a driven exit roller 
(17), there being provided brushes (19a, 20a; 19b, 20b) which 

interact alternately with the teaseling and/or fluffing rollers 
(13, 14), between the feed roller (16) and the drum (11) and, 

respectively, between the exit roller (17) and the drum (11) there 
being interposed two further rollers (16b, 17b) the shafts (16a,  

 
17a) of which are rotatably supported on automatic tension control 

devices (24a, 24b) fixed to the load-bearing structure (10) and 
controlling respective motors (31) of the feed roller (16) and 

exit roller (17), in order to automatically control and regulate 
the fabric tension, both at its entry and at its exit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a teaseling and/or fluffing machine for
fabric and knitwork with tension control.Known teaseling and/or fluffing machines are composed essentially
of one or more drums rotating with predetermined direction and
speed, along their circumference there being housed a certain
number of teaseling and/or fluffing rollers. If the rollers are
teaseling rollers they are embraced by cloth carrying the needles
alternately in the same direction as the fabric (with the pile)
and in the opposite direction (against the pile), they rotating
about themselves under independent control. The same applies to
fluffing rollers, which carry an abrasive paper covering instead
of cloth carrying needles. These rollers also rotate with
predeterminable speed and direction.The fabric to be teaseled and/or fluffed wraps a considerable part
of the drum circumference and part of the teaseling and/or
fluffing rollers, it being fed via an entry roller and extracted
from the drum via an exit roller. These entry and exit rollers
also rotate at predetermined speed, depending on the working or
advancement speed of the fabric. The speed of the two rollers can be different and predetermined in
relation to the desired fabric tension.EP-A-224 683 (upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based) relates to a teaseling machine in which a
fabric tension control device is provided. This device
comprises dancing rolls and there is not a direct
detection of the tension of the fabric on the drum.
EP-A-534 151 discloses a generical machine for fabric
treatment in which is used a load cell for regulating
the tension of a fabric onto a roll which controls the
speed of the motor of a calender.A constant fabric tension results in a constant teaseling and/or
fluffing effect.If the physical conditions of the fabric change, for example it
becomes more or less dry or its selvedges vary, then its tension
changes, and in order to be able to respond to modern requirements
the plant has to be provided with automatic systems which ensure a
constant predetermined tension.The object of the present invention is to solve the aforesaid
problems.This object is attained according to the present invention by a
teaseling and/or fluffing machine according to claim 1.  The characteristics and advantages of a teaseling and/or fluffing
machine according to the present invention will be more apparent
from the ensuing description given by way of non-limiting example
with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine for fabric and
knitwork with tension control, comprising essentially a load-bearing

structure consisting of two sidepieces (10) supporting at
least one drum (11) which rotates about a central shaft (12) and

supports on its two lateral endpieces (11a, 11b) two series of
teaseling and/or fluffing rollers of with-pile type (13) and

against-pile type (14), these being arranged along the generators
of said drum (11) with those of one series rotating relative to

those of the other under independent drive, a fabric (15) to be
treated passing about said teaseling and/or fluffing rollers (13,

14) and being fed to the machine by a driven feed roller (16) and
extracted therefrom by a driven exit roller (17), there also being

provided brushes (19a, 20a; 19b, 20b) which interact alternately
with said teaseling and/or fluffing rollers (13, 14),

characterised in that between said feed roller (16) and said drum
(11) and, respectively, between said exit roller (17) and said

drum (11) there are interposed two further rollers (16b, 17b) the
shafts (16a, 17a) of which are rotatably suppurted on automatic

tension control devices (24a, 24b) fixed to said load-bearing
structure (10) and controlling respective motors (31) of said feed

roller (16) and exit roller (17), in order to automatically
control and regulate the fabric tension, both at its entry and at

its exit,

in that said automatic tension control devices
consist of electronic load cells (24a, 24b) and
 
in that said shafts (16a, 17a) have their axes

inclinable by a motor means (25) which is automatically controlled
by said load cells (24a, 24b) each time the load on these latter

is found to be unbalanced, hence equalizing the selvedge tension.
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said shafts (16a, 17a), are arranged on

supports (26) positioned on said load cells (24a, 24b) provided
with said motor means (25).
A teaseling and/or fluffing machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that at least one of said two side pieces (10) provides slots where said shafts (16a, 17a) are slidably supported, said slots and said load cells (24a, 24b) being provided in a horizontal direction.
