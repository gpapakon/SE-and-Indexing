<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement comprising a controllable clock 
signal source (1) and a decision circuit (8) for determining the polarity of a received 

biphase signal at two successive sampling instants in a single symbol interval. The 
arrangement likewise comprises a phase detector (35) with a first comparator (16) to 

compare the polarity samples at the two sampling instants with each other. The phase 
detector generates a control signal for adjusting the frequency and phase of the 

adjustable clock signal source (1) in response to the output signal of the first 
comparator. Furthermore, the arrangement comprises a second comparator (28) for 

comparing polarity samples at the same relative sampling instant in two successive 
sampling instants with each other. According to the invention the second comparator 

(28) will inhibit phase detector (35) in response to the output signal of this second 
detector. In the case of false synchronization, the output of phase detector (35) will 

continue to present the same signal value, so that automatically an adjustment is made 
of the instant of correct synchronization. This adjustment is carried out by a VCO (3) 

and/or phase shifter means (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for generating a clock signal from 
a received biphase-modulated signal, comprising a controllable clock signal source, a 
decision arrangement for sampling the polarity of the received biphase signal at a first 
sampling instant ad at a second sampling instant in a symbol interval, the sampling 
instants having a fixed time spacing, a first comparator for comparing the polarity 
samples at the first and at the second sampling instant in the symbol interval with each 
other, a phase detector having an output for supplying, in response to the output signal 
of the first comparator, a control signal for controlling the frequency and phase of the 
clock signal source, and a second comparator for comparing the polarity samples at the 
same relative sampling instant in two successive symbol intervals with each other.
 
   Such arrangements may find their application in receiving devices for 
digital signals which are used, for example, in subscriber sets of digital telephone 
systems. Such an arrangement is known from Dutch Patent Application 8 401 310 
(PHN 11.019). The two sampling instants, for example, instants tB and tF, are derived 
from the local controllable clock signal source and are to be synchronized with the 
received biphase-modulated signal.
 
   The sampling instants are a fixed time interval apart. In said arrangement 
they are approximately one-third to one-fourth symbol interval apart. There is mention 
of a state of synchronization when the second sampling instant tF occurs just in the 
middle of the symbol interval. The symbol values at the first instant tB represent the 
transferred information. To reach this condition of correct synchronization, the sampling 
instants are shifted relative to the received biphase signal until the sampling instant tF 
occurs just in the middle of a symbol interval. This shift is realised by applying the 
generated control signal to the controllable clock signal source which comprises a  
 
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The oscillator is slightly delayed or accelerated 
depending on the control signal.
 
   It is also possible to have a state of called "false" synchronization, 
which occurs on the boundary between two successive symbol intervals. This state is 
detected by a 64-counter connected to the output of the second comparator. If the same 
signal value is detected 64 times in a row, the output of the 64-counter produces a 
signal to indicate the state of false synchronization.
 
   Said method is
