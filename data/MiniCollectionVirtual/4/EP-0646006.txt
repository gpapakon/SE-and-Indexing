Stable formulation of omeprazole microgranules 
containing a neutral core consisting of sugar and starch, 

characterized in that it contains an active layer composed 
of a dilution of omeprazole in mannitol in an 

omeprazole/mannitol ratio by weight in the region of 1 
and an external gastroprotection layer composed of a 

gastroresistant coating of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 
phthalate type and of talc. 
Formulation according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the active omeprazole layer contains substantially 

10 % by weight of carboxymethylstarch. 
Formulation according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the active omeprazole layer contains substantially 

5 % of a surface-active compound such as sodium 
lauryl sulphate. 
Forumlation according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that it contains, at the surface of 

the active omeprazole layer, an additional protective 
layer composed of mannitol. 
Formulation according to any one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the dilution of omeprazole in 

mannitol and the said protective layer are applied by 
means of a high-viscosity binder of hydroxypropyl 

methylcellulose type. 
Omeprazole microgranules containing a neutral 
core consisting of sugar and starch, characterized in 

that they contain an active layer composed of a dilution 
of omeprazole in mannitol in an omeprazole/mannitol ratio 

by weight in the region of 1. 
Process for producing a formulation according to  
 

any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a dry 
dilution of mannitol and of omeprazole is applied to 

neutral grains consisting of sugar and of starch with the 
aid of a high-viscosity binding solution of hydroxypropyl 

methylcellulose type in solution in a mixture of at least 
80 % ethanol and at most 20 % water and in that the 

additional protective layer and/or the gastroresistant 
coating is/are then applied. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that each application of the dry dilution is followed by 

drying at a temperature between 35°C and 40°C for a time 
which makes it possible to lower the water content of the 

active microgranules to 1 % and their ethanol content to 
2000 ppm. 
Process according to Claims 7 and 8, characterized 
in that neutral microgranules are used whose size 

is between 0.7 and 0.9 mm. 
Process according to Claims 7, 8 and 9, characterized 
in that flat-bottomed turbines are used to carry 

out the active dilution applications and the gastroprotection 
coatings.
