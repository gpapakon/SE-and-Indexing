<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a needle tip protective device (22). In one embodiment the needle tip protective device (22) includes a needle guard (41) that is slidably mounted on a hypodermic needle (10) having a needle tip (11) located at the distal end of the needle (10). The needle guard (41) contains a movable needle trap (41) that is biased against or toward the hypodermic needle (10). The needle trap (41) advances over the tip (11) of the needle, entrapping the needle tip (11) as the needle guard (41) is urged forward near the sharpened distal end of the hypodermic needle (10). A tether (24), or other limiting means, limits the forward movement of the needle guard (41) along the needle (10). In one embodiment, the needle guard is manually urged forward along the shaft of the needle by the user. In yet another embodiment, a spring, or other biasing means (19), is used to move the needle guard (41) along the shaft of the needle (10).

 NEEDLE TIP GUARD FOR HYPODERMIC NEEDLESRELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is related to and claims the benefit of filing dates of the following United States Provisional Patent Applications: (1) Serial No. 60/012,343, entitled PROTECTED HYPODERMIC NEEDLE WITH AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL COVERING MEANS, filed February 27, 1996; (2) Serial No. 60/025,273, entitled HYPODERMIC DEVICES WITH SAFETYFEATURES, filed September 12, 1996; and (3) Serial No. 60/031,399, entitled HYPODERMIC DEVICES WITH IMPROVED SAFETY FEATURES, filed November 19, 1996.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to needle tip guards for hypodermic needles.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe advent of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), combined with the increasing incidence of other bloodborne pathogens such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), present healthcare workers with an occupational hazard unprecedented in modern medicine. The risk of contracting HIV from a needlestick injury is approximately 1 in 250, but for those who contract HIV infection as a result of a needlestick injury the risk becomes 1 in 1. The risk of contracting the more contagious HBV as a result of a needlestick injury ranges from 1 in 6 to 1 in 30.There are also over twenty more known bloodborne pathogens which are transmitted via blood and bodily fluids. The presence of any of these pathogens in patients poses a 

risk to healthcare workers when invasive procedures are performed. Infectious diseases are now the third leading cause of death, behind heart disease and cancer, signifying a growing need for safer hypodermic equipment. Ten years ago, infectious diseases were classified as the fifth leading cause of death, they are now ranked third. This increase of infectious disease is attributed mainly to the over-use of antibiotics and the growing availability of re-usable, hollow-bore hypodermic equipment. As the population of infected individuals increases, more people will be treated by healthcare workers, further increasing the odds of disease transmission from patient to healthcare worker. Also, the use of disposable hypodermic equipment is increasing at approximately 7% per annum. Additionally, a meaningful number of clusters of patient to patient transmission in the healthcare setting has been identified throughout the world. Early data suggests improper infection control techniques contribute directly to this increase: including improper use of hypodermic equipment, multiple-dose medicine vials; and failure to change
