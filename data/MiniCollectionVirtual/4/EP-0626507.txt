<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic system in which the accuracy of the 
diagnosis of the deterioration state of a catalyst (40 in 

Fig. 1) in a catalytic converter (4) for cleaning the 
exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine (2) is 

enhanced without incurring a rise in cost. The temperature 
of the catalyst (40) is estimated using the operating-state 

signal (for example, the flow rate of intake air Qa or the 
width 120 of a fuel injection pulse) of the engine (2) by a 

diagnostic device (8). The conversion efficiency of the 

catalyst (40) calculated from the outputs of oxygen sensors 
(6a, 6b) is corrected using the estimated temperature by 

the diagnostic device (8). The deterioration state of the 
catalyst (40) is diagnosed on the basis of the corrected 

temperature by the diagnostic device (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst-deterioration diagnostic system for a
catalytic converter which is employed for treating exhaust gas
emitted from an internal combustion engine.It has been known that, in making the exhaust gas of an
internal combustion engine innoxious through oxidizing and
deoxidizing reactions, effectively the reactions are promoted
by employing a catalyst which contains a plurality of kinds of
catalytic components. In this regard, when the catalyst is
used for a long term, it deteriorates into a lower conversion
efficiency. Therefore, such a step has heretofore been taken
that the conversion efficiency of the catalyst is checked
mainly at the time of a routine inspection, and that a
catalytic converter including the 
catalyst is replaced when the regulated value of the
conversion efficiency is not met. Accordingly, the
conversion efficiency is not especially checked till the
routine inspection, and a vehicle in which the catalytic
converter is installed runs under the unsatisfactory
innoxious condition of the exhaust gas in some cases.Such circumstances unfavorably lead to environmental
pollution. Attempts have therefore been made to check the
performance or activity of the catalyst at all times by any
method, and to actuate a warning device or a countermeasure
device when the catalyst is abnormal. Examples will be
stated below.Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2896/1982
discloses a technique wherein oxygen-percentage detectors
are respectively mounted before and behind a catalytic
converter so as to diagnose the state of the catalytic
converter on the basis of the detected values of both the
detectors. Concretely, the detectors capable of detecting
the oxygen concentrations of exhaust gas are respectively
disposed upstream and downstream of the catalytic
converter. When the oxygen concentration of the exhaust
gas detected by either of the detectors has abnormally
fallen outside a preset range until the difference thereof
from the output of the other detector has exceeded a preset
magnitude, a signal is generated to actuate an alarm device
or a device for taking steps to rectify the abnormality. In addition, according to a technique entitled
"Apparatus for Detecting Deterioration of Catalyst" as
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
249320/1991, the correlation coefficient of the output
signals of oxygen sensors mounted before and behind a
catalytic converter is calculated so as to diagnose the
state of a catalyst.Further, a method which adopts a
