<ABSTRACT>
A three-dimensional cell (1) is subdivided by at least two fixed partitions (7, 8, 9) into mutually separated areas, for example a living area (10), a shower booth (11) and a WC booth (12). The three-dimensional cell (1) is characterized in that it has a further available area (13) besides said areas. By selectively moving a mobile partition (14), the further available area (13) may be added to at least another area in order to increase the useful surface of the latter.

<CLAIMS>
Room cell (1), in particular living cell, with at 
least two room zones, for example a recreation zone (10), 

a shower cell (11) and a WC cell (12), which are 
separated from one another by means of a fixed partition 

(7, 8, 9), characterized by an available zone (13) which 
is present in addition to the room zones and is arranged 

within the room cell, and around which the room zones are 
grouped and which, by means of a movable mobile wall 

(14), can be selectively added to at least one room zone 
in order to enlarge the effective area of the latter. 
Room cell according to claim 1, characterized by 
such a dimensioning of the mobile wall (14) in relation 

to the position of the fixed partition or partitions (7, 
8, 9) that, in individual functional positions, at least 

one room zone is completely separated spatially from the 
available zone (13). 
Room cell according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that at least the mobile wall (14) 

extends over the entire room height. 
Room cell according to one or more of the above-mentioned 
claims, characterized in that the mobile wall 

(14) is guided displaceably in the manner of a sliding 
door on the room ceiling and/or the room floor. 
Room cell according to Claim 4, characterized by 
a sliding guide (18, 35, 36) which is endlessly closed on 

itself, in particular circular, and which delimits the 
available zone from the room zones (10, 11, 12). 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of the 
abovementioned claims, characterized in that the mobile  

 
wall (14) can be retained in individual functional 

positions. 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of the 
abovementioned claims, characterized in that the mobile 

wall (14) can be varied in its effective width, in 
particular be designed as a folding wall. 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the mobile wall (14) is 

rigid. 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of the 
abovementioned claims, characterized in that the mobile 

wall (14) is concavely recessed on its side facing the 
available zone (13), the longitudinal axis of the recess 

being vertical. 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of 
Claims 5 to 9, characterized by a circular shape of the 

sliding guide (19, 35, 36) and by a shape of the mobile 
wall (14) in the form of a segment of a cylinder 

envelope. 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of the 
abovementioned claims, characterized by a multi-part 

mobile wall (14) comprising, in particular, two wall 
parts (33, 34) arranged next to one another and 

displaceable independently of one another. 
Room cell (1) according to Claim 11, 
characterized by such a dimensioning of the wall parts 

(33, 34) that each of them separates at least one room 
zone (10, 11, 12) completely from the available zone 

(13). 
Room cell (1) according to Claim 11 or 12, 
characterized in that the wall parts (33, 34) are 

displaceable in adjacent sliding guides (35, 36). 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of the 
abovementioned claims, characterized by a motor drive of 

the mobile wall (14). 
Room cell (1) according to Claim 14, 
characterized by an electric or mechanical control device 

for selecting individual functional positions of the 
mobile wall (14).  

 
Room cell (1) according to one or more of the 
abovementioned claims, characterized in that the mobile 

wall (14) is transparent. 
Room cells (1) according to one or more of the 
abovementioned claims, characterized by a frame
