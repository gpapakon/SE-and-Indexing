<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording apparatus has an ink 
recording region and an electrostatic attraction 

means (31). The ink recording region is located at 
a position spaced from an ink jet recording head 

(1). The electrostatic attraction means (31) is 
arranged at an opposite side to a surface of a 

recording medium (6) to be recorded, in the ink 
recording region. The means has a plurality of 

first regions (34) and second regions (41) which are 
alternately distributed. The first regions (34) 

electrostatically attract the recording medium (6) 
in the ink recording region relatively strongly and 

the second regions (41) attract the recording medium 
relatively weakly. The electrostatic attraction 

means (31) serves to minimize the effects of 
cockling and that assures stable, high quality 

recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording apparatus
having a mechanism which attracts a recording medium by an
electrostatic attraction means and more particularly to an ink
jet recording apparatus that minimises influences of cockling
during ink recording. The present invention also relates to a
process of ink jet recording using the apparatus above.From US 5 216 442 is known an ink jet printer including a
platen having a planar surface sized to hold a sheet upon which
an image is to be printed flat on the planar surface. The
platen is movably mounted for linear reciprocal movement
between a sheet receiving position and a sheet releasing
position. In operation, a sheet is fed onto or otherwise
acquired on the platen. The sheet can be held on the platen by
a hold down force such as by vacuum of electrostatic
attraction. The platen moves the sheet held thereon across the
full width print head located between the two positions to
print an image on the sheet. Sheets are released from the
platen at the sheet releasing position which may include an
output tray. After the sheet is released form the platen, the
platen is reciprocated back to the receiving position to accept
another sheet. During periods when the platen is at either the
sheet receiving position or at the sheet releasing position, a
maintenance station located between the receiving position and
the releasing position on a side of the platen opposite from
the print head may be used to perform maintenance on the print
head. Here, the word recording also means printing,
which includes the action of applying ink to any
kind of ink holding member, such as cloth, threads,
paper, plastic sheets and flexible sheet materials,
and also includes various kinds of information
processing apparatus or printers as their output
devices. The invention is applicable to these
apparatuses.Generally, in ink jet recording apparatuses, a
gap must be kept constantly interval defined between
the surface of a recording medium and an ink jet
recording head to ensure stable recording. This
requires a means to hold the recording medium
attracted on a feeding system. Among examples of
this means is the specification of U.S. Patent No.
5,245,364, which discloses a means for injecting
electric charges, from a high-voltage source through 
a charger and rollers, onto an insulation layer the
top layer of a two-layer transport belt consisting
