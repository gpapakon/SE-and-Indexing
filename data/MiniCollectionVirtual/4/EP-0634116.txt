<ABSTRACT>
An improved jewelry box (100) which incorporates a light 
source to direct light rays at the jewelry contained therein 

when the jewelry box is opened. The box consists, generally, 
of a conventionally-shaped jewelry box with a top section (12) 

and bottom section (11). The top (12) and bottom (11) sections are 
hingedly 

joined together. A miniature, high-intensity lamp (16) bulb is 
mounted at the inner surface of the top (12) section. A power 

source (6,6A) is contained under the jewelry support pad located in 
the bottom (11) section. An electric switch (25) is incorporated into 

the hinge (13) about which the top (12) section pivots relative to the 
bottom (11) section. The switch (25) automatically closes the 

electrical circuit between the power source (20,20A) and the light 
source when the box (100) is opened.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the invention. This invention relates to 
jewelry boxes, in general, and to illuminated jewelry boxes, in 
particular. 2. Prior Art. Jewelry boxes are well-known in the art. 
One particular type of jewelry box is especially adapted to 
contain a ring or similar item of jewelry. This type of 
jewelry box has top and bottom sections hingedly joined 
together. The bottom section of the box is, generally, fairly 
deep so as to receive and retain a support pad which, in turn, 
receives and retains at least a portion of a ring. The pad, 
typically, includes a groove for receiving and retaining at 
least a portion of the ring. A portion of the ring (as well as 
the jewel and setting, if any) extends above and is displayed 
above the support pad. The top section of the box is, typically, also fairly deep 
whereby the jewel and setting displayed above the pad are not 
touched by the top section. The hinge is, typically, an overcenter hinge which includes 
a leaf spring. This hinge arrangement is designed to forcefully 
cause the top and bottom sections to the open or closed 
position when a certain relative positioning of the sections 
occurs. Thus, the box is maintained in the open position or 
is, alternatively, forcefully put in the closed position, i.e. 
snapped shut, when the top section achieves a nearly closed 
position. In some cases, a decorative liner or covering can be used 
on the exposed inner surfaces of the box. The outside of the 
box is esthetically treated, as desired. In the past, attempts have been made to enhance the market-ability 
of jewelry items by making the boxes more attractive. 
In some cases, an illuminating device has been added to the  
 
box. However, in the past these illumination devices have been 
relatively modest miniature lamps which provide little or no 
illumination. Likewise, the switch mechanism which activates 
the light source has been specially designed as an "add-on" to 
the existing box. The prior art designs have been cumbersome, 
expensive and, generally, ineffective. The following patents, listed in numerical order, were 
discovered in a preliminary search. U.S. Patent No. 712,112; ILLUMINATED WATCH BOX; C. Arnold. 
This patent discloses an illuminated watch box. U.S. Patent No. 2,159,954; VANITY CASE; W. A. Preisz. This 
patent discloses an illuminated vanity case. U.S. Patent No. 2,453,621; ILLUMINATED COMPACT; O. W. 
Chinn. This patent discloses an illuminated compact. U.S. Patent No. 2,867,353; DISPLAY BOX FOR WATCHES, ETC.;

<CLAIMS>
A lighted box comprising, 
   a bottom section, 

   a top section, 
   hinge means connecting said bottom section with said 

top section, 
   said hinge formed of electrically conductive material, 

   a miniature lamp located within said top section for 
selectively illuminating at least said bottom section, 

   power source means contained in said bottom section, 
   first conductor means connected from said miniature 

lamp to said power source means, 
   second conductor means connected from said miniature 

lamp to said hinge means, 
   third conductor means connected from power source means 

and disposed adjacent to said hinge means in a non-conductive 
manner, and 

   a spring clip means connected to said hinge means 
whereby when said top section is pivoted to an open position 

to allow access to the inside of the box, said spring clip 
means is stretched to contact said third conductor and 

complete an electrical circuit path between said lamp and 
said power source. 
A lighted box comprising, 
   a bottom section, 

   a top section, 
   hinge means connecting said bottom section with said 

top section, 
   a miniaturized lamp located within said top section for 

selectively illuminating said top section and bottom 
section, 

   power source means contained in said bottom section, 
and

 
   a spring clip means connected to said hinge means 

whereby when said top section is pivoted to an open position 
to allow access to the inside of the box, said spring clip 

means is stretched to contact said hinge and closes an 
electrical circuit path between said lamp and said power 

source. 
The box recited in claim 1 or 2 including, 
   an insert fitted within said bottom section for 

supporting an item. 
The box recited in claim 1 or 2 or 3 including, 
   a fabric lining mounted at the inner surface of said 

top section. 
The box recited in any of claims 1 to 4 wherein, 
   said lamp comprises a high intensity light bulb. 
The box recited in any of claims 1 to 5 wherein, 
   said spring clip means flexes away from said hinge 

means and third conductor means, respectively, and opens the

source when the top section of said box is pivoted to a 
closed position. 
The box recited in any of claims 1 to 6 including, 
   reflector means mounted in said top section adjacent 

said miniature lamp, 
   wherein, preferably said miniature lamp extends into 

said reflector means, 
   and wherein, preferably said power source comprises a 

battery. 
The box recited in any of the preceding claims 
wherein, 

   said insert includes a groove therein for receiving at
