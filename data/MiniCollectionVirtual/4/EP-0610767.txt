<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a compact electric motor, in particular a converter-part asynchronous motor, which always switches reliably, is provided for driving motor vehicles in that a monitoring arrangement which consists of a magnet field sensor control and a rotor (31) which is mounted on the motor shaft (11) is provided in that the rotor (41) is rotatably arranged between the winding heads (19, 20), which project beyond the end face (45) of the stator plates (47), of the stator windings and has on its end face (40) facing the end plate (7) a permanent magnetic ring (43) which is magnetised in a multipole fashion and whose poles (49) can be sensed by a plurality of magnet field sensors (33) which are arranged concentrically with respect to the motor shaft (11) and within the motor housing (3).
