<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of chlorine dioxide from an alkali metal chlorate, 
a mineral acid and hydrogen peroxide as the reducing 
agent. The invention also relates to a process for the 
production of chlorine dioxide from chloric acid or a 
mixture of chloric acid and alkali metal chlorate. More 
particularly, the invention relates to production of 
chlorine dioxide in the presence of a complexing agent. 
Chlorine dioxide used in aqueous solution is of considerable 
commercial interest, mainly in pulp bleaching, 
but also in water purification, fat bleaching, removal of 
phenols from industrial wastes, etc. It is therefore 
desirable to provide processes in which chlorine dioxide 
can be efficiently produced. There are a lot of different processes fcr chlorine 
dioxide production. The most commonly used reducing agents 
are chloride ions, methanol and sulphur dioxide. The draw 
back with chloride ions as the reducing agent is the 
formation of half a mole of chlorine for each mole of 
chlorine dioxide formed. Increasing environnental demands 
have brought about a change over to reducing agents which 
do not produce chlorine as a by-product, mainly methanol. 
A draw back with methanol as the reducing agent can be the 
formation of chlorinated organic compounds, from by-products 
of methanol, in the bleaching train. It is well 
Known that the efficiency of the added methanol is lowlered 
due to side reactions where formaldehyde and formic acid 
are formed. Also some of the methanol leaves the reactor 
without having participated in the reduction. The corresponding 
ether and ester are probably there as well. It  
 
could be expected that reactions can occur in the bleaching 
train with the aldehyde, acid, ether and ester resulting 
in chlorinated organic compounds. The reduction with 
methanol is also rather slow at low acid strength in the 
interval 2 - 5 N if catalysts are not incorporated. In U.S. Patents 5 091 166 and 
5 091 167 it was found that hydrogen peroxide was 
a surprisingly effective reducing agent in the whole acid 
interval 2 - 11 N. It was found that with hydrogen peroxide 
as the reducing agent it is possible to obtain a 
process with a very high reaction rate and efficiency and 
in the interval 2 - 5 N for the acid strength, the reaction 
rate exceeded the rate of known processes with several 
hundreds per cent without the aid of catalysts. It was 
also possible to produce essentially chlorine free chlorine 
dioxide. The following formula

A process for the production of chlorine dioxide, 
comprising reacting at least one of chloric acid and an alkali 

metal chlorate with hydrogen peroxide as the reducing agent to 
produce chlorine dioxide in a reaction medium maintained at a
