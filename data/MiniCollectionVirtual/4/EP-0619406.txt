<ABSTRACT>
A clamping wedge (24) for laying parquet boards on floors enclosed by walls, which wedge can be inserted between wall and the board adjacent thereto for the purpose of securing a clearance there, is distinguished in that its wedge surfaces (32, 40) are aligned parallel to one another and are formed by the outer sides of two individual plate parts (30, 38), of which the mutual spacing (50) can be systematically fixed as required such that the spacing cannot fall below a systematically fixed minimum spacing (50) as a result of compressive forces acting on the wedge surfaces (32, 40).

Method of laying parquet blocks (12) on floors 
(18) surrounded by walls (20), in the case of which 

method a clamping wedge (24) is introduced between the 
wall (20) and the block (12) adjacent thereto in order to 

ensure a clearance (22) there, 

a) the wedging surfaces (32, 40) of which clamping 
wedge are aligned parallel to one another, 
b) in the case of which the clamping surfaces are 
formed by the outer sides of two individual plate parts 

(30, 38), 
c) in the case of which the mutual spacing (50) between 
said wedging surfaces can be fixed in accordance with 

requirements as planned, and 
d) in the case of which a spacer member (56) is fitted 
between the two plate parts, it being possible for the 

spacing length of said spacer member to be set, with the 
result that a minimum spacing (50) which is fixed as 

planned is not undershot due to compressive forces acting 
on the wedging surfaces (32, 40). 
Clamping wedge for implementing the method 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that 


one plate part is designed in the form of an L (26, 30) 
and the other plate part is designed in the form of a Z 

(28, 36, 38). 
one free leg (30) of the L-shaped plate part forms, 
with its outer surface (32), one wedging surface, and one 

free leg (38) of the Z-shaped plate part forms, with its 
outer surface (40) opposite thereto, the other wedging 

surface, 
the at least one spacer member (48) is fastened on the 
L-shaped plate part, 
at least one through-bore is provided in the Z-shaped 
plate part, such that the Z-shaped plate part can be 

adjusted in position along the spacer member (48), 
a through-bore (52) with an internal thread (54) is 
provided in the Z-shaped plate part, in which through-bore 

a screwing member (56) is screwed in by one end 
(58), while its other end (60) can be laid against the  

 
L-shaped plate part (30) in a pressure-exerting manner. 
Clamping wedge according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that a leg (70) is provided to jut out on the 

L-shaped part, by means of which leg (70) the interspace 
(72) between the two plate parts (26, 28) is covered. 
Clamping wedge according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that outer surfaces (32, 40) are 

designed to have planar surfaces, such that, by means of 
said outer surfaces (32, 40), the clamping wedge can be 

laid with surface contact on one or more blocks (12) at 
the same time.
