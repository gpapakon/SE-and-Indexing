<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of EPM or EPDM comprising 
contacting ethylene, propylene, and, optionally, one or more dienes, in 

a fluidized bed, at a temperature at or above the sticking temperature 
of the product resin, under polymerization conditions, with a 

prepolymer, which is not sticky at the process temperature; a 
cocatalyst; and, optionally, a halocarbon promoter; and, optionally, an 

inert particulate material, wherein the amount of prepolymer or the 

combined amount of prepolymer and inert particulate material is 
sufficient to essentially prevent agglomeration of the fluidized bed and 

the product resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of sticky polymers,
particularly elastomers having a crystallinity of less than about 10
percent by weight.The production of amorphous EPR elastomers in a gas
phase fluidized bed process above their sticking temperatures is
difficult due to agglomeration of the sticky, granular resin bed
particles under polymerization conditions.The term "sticky polymer" is defined as a polymer which,
although particulate at temperatures below the sticking temperature,
agglomerates at temperatures at or above the sticking temperature.
The term "sticking temperature", which, in the context of this
specification, concerns the sticking temperature of particles of
polymer in a fluidized bed, is defined as the temperature at which
fluidization ceases due to the agglomeration of particles in the bed.
The agglomeration may be spontaneous or occur on short periods of
settling.A polymer may be inherently sticky due to its chemical or
mechanical properties or pass through a sticky phase during the
production cycle. Sticky polymers are also referred to as non-free
flowing polymers because of their tendency to compact into aggregates
of much larger size than the original particles and not flow out of the
relatively small openings in the bottom of product discharge tanks or
purge bins. Polymers of this type show acceptable fluidity in a gas
phase fluidized bed reactor; however, once motion ceases, the
additional mechanical force provided by the fluidizing gas passing
through the distributor plate is insufficient to break up the aggregates
which form and the bed will not refluidize. These polymers are 
classified as those, which have a minimum bin opening for free flow
at zero storage time of up to 61 cm (two feet) and a minimum bin opening for
free flow at storage times of greater than five minutes of 122 to 244 cm (4 to 8 feet) or
more.Because of the tendency to agglomerate, sticky polymers are
difficult to produce in typical gas phase processes, which are usually
carried out in fluidized beds. Both economic and
safety/environmental considerations indicate, however, that fluidized
bed type polymerization is preferred for the manufacture of polymers
that can exist in a granular, fluidizable form.Although polymers that are sticky can be produced in non-gas
phase processes, there are certain difficulties associated with the
production of such products in, for example, slurry or bulk monomer
polymerization processes. In such processes, the diluent or solvent is
present in the resins exiting the
