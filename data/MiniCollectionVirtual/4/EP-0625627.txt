<ABSTRACT>
The device for automatically controlling drives for, in particular, roller shutters, blinds or the like is provided with a brightness sensor arrangement (10) which outputs a first output signal upon overshooting of a settable first brightness threshold and a second output signal upon undershooting of a settable second brightness threshold. The output signals of the brightness sensor arrangement (10) are received by a device (20) for limiting the switching times. In response to the reception of an output signal from the brightness sensor arrangement (10), this device outputs an output signal only if the reception is outside a blocking time and/or blocking time interval which can be set for at least one output signal of the brightness sensor arrangement (10). Coupled to the device (20) for limiting the switching times is at least one delay device (26) with a settable delay time interval, which is connected for its part to a drive (28) to be controlled. In response to the reception of the output signal of the device (20) for limiting the switching times, the delay device (26) generates a drive signal, delayed by the set delay time interval, for the drive (28) for moving the roller shutter up or down.
