Liquid-crystal display arrangement consisting of 
a liquid-crystal display (10), a light source constructed 

as a fluorescent lamp (12) and a heat source (14) which 
is thermally coupled to the fluorescent lamp (12), 

characterized in that the heat source (14) is formed by 
a temperature-controlled foil-type heating element (14), 

and in that the foil-type heating element (14) and/or the 
fluorescent lamp (12) is thermally coupled to a PTC 

thermistor (16), and the PTC thermistor (16) is connected 
electrically in series to the foil-type heating element 

(14). 
Liquid-crystal display arrangement according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the foil-type heating 

element (14) has a U-shaped configuration, and in that 
the PTC thermistor (16) is arranged between the limbs 

(18) of the foil-type heating element (14). 
Liquid-crystal display arrangement according to 
one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the temperature-controlled 

foil-type heating element (14) has a 
maximum calorific power of approximately 25 W and a 

minimum calorific power of approximately 7 W, and in that 
the minimum calorific power is established when a temperature 

of approximately 40Â°C is reached.
