<ABSTRACT>
The use of an antigen (or antibody) previously 
modified with a hapten makes the immunoassay of a trace 

component (analyte) on the basis of a change of 
turbidity or scattered light intensity caused by 

antigen-antibody reaction rapid and easy with high 
accuracy and high reproduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an immunoassay 
method which permits specific, rapid and accurate 
quantitation of trace components in body fluids such as 
serum, plasma and urine. In recent years, autoanalyzers capable of 
analyzing many samples for many items at the same time 
have spread, and attempts have been made to apply a 
method for immunoassay of a trace component utilizing 
antigen-antibody reaction to the autoanalyzers. Typical examples of method applicable to the 
autoanalyzers are so-called immunoturbidimetry in which 
an objective component is measured by measuring a 
turbidity change caused by antigen-antibody reaction, 
and so-called immunonephelometry in which an objective 
component is measured by measuring a scattered light 
intensity change caused by antigen-antibody reaction. These methods, however, are disadvantageous in 
that when the amount of an analyte to be measured in a 
sample is small (namely, when the concentration of the 
analyte is low), the measured value of the analyte is 
lower than its theoretical value, so that the analyte 
cannot be accurately measured. In the above methods, for removing such a 
defect, there are investigated, for example, a method of  
 
adding a large amount of an antigen-antibody reaction 
accelerator such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or 
chondroitin sulfate to a measuring system, and a method 
of increasing the absolute amount of a sample. Both of 
these methods, however, are disadvantageous in that 
measurement errors are caused by substances present in a 
sample together with an analyte to be measured or by an 
insoluble material produced by a nonspecific reaction. 
Therefore, there is a desire to seek further improvement 
in the methods. This invention was made in view of such 
conditions and is intended to provide an immunoassay 
method which permits accurate, highly-reproducible, 
rapid and easy measurement of an analyte to be measured, 
even in a low concentration range and is applicable to 
autoanalyzers. This invention provides a method for 
immunoassay of a trace component (analyte) on the basis 
of a change of turbidity or scattered light intensity 
caused by antigen-antibody reaction, which uses an 
antigen previously modified with a hapten, as antigen 
against an antibody to be measured. This invention also provides a method for 
immunoassay of a trace component (analyte) on the basis 
of a change of turbidity or scattered light intensity 
caused by antigen-antibody reaction, which uses an  
 
antibody previously modified with a hapten,
