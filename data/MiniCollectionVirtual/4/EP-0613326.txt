<ABSTRACT>
A high intensity discharge lamp ignitor which shuts off after a 
predetermined time period has elapsed. The ignitor is sensitive to voltage dips in power 

line voltage and resets a timer whenever the power line voltage drops below a level 
sufficient for lighting a lamp load. Restart of the lamp load immediately following 

restoration of power line voltage is achieved without requiring the power line voltage be 
removed from the ignitor or otherwise reduced to approximately 0 volts before restart 

can be initiated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a high intensity discharge (HID) lamp 
ignitor, and more particularly to an ignitor also capable of restarting an HID lamp. An HID lamp generally refers to lamps of the high pressure mercury, 
high pressure sodium, metal halide, high pressure metal vapor and low pressure sodium 
types. An HID lamp is ignited through application of a high voltage pulse, nominally 
of several thousand volts, across the electrodes of the lamp. The high voltage pulses are 
produced by pulsed ignition circuits (i.e. ignitors). Many conventional ignitors operate 
continuously, that is, applying at least one ignition pulse across the lamp socket(s) every 
half cycle of the AC line voltage until the lamp lights. Continuous generation of high 
voltage pulses applied across the lamp socket(s) when no longer required (e.g. when the 
lamp has been previously removed from the socket(s) or has already failed (burned out)) 
subjects the ballast insulation and components to undue stress. In order to control and thereby limit the time during which the high 
voltage pulses are generated by the ignitor, timer circuits within the ballast, such as 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,070,279, have been employed. In such circuits 
(hereinafter referred to as shut-off type ignitors), the timer is set to activate the ignitor 
for a short, predetermined period after power is first applied to the lamp fixture and to 
thereafter disable operation of the ignitor until line power has been removed and then 
reapplied. Possible voltage stress on both the ballast insulation and components which 
might otherwise occur through continuous generation of ignition pulses is therefore 
reduced. This shut-off type ignitor, however, does not reignite the HID lamp when a 
voltage dip (transient) occurs sufficient to turn OFF the lamp but not low enough to 
reset the timer. The inability of a conventional shut-off type ignitor to attempt reignition 
of the lamp following extinction due to the aforementioned dip in line voltage is a 
serious drawback. Shut-off type ignitors, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,070,279, 
also require the timer circuit be powered based on the voltage applied to the lamp. No 
one timer circuit can be used for controlling ignitors which vary in ignition pulse  
 
amplitude and/or length of time during which the ignition pulses are generated since the 
timer circuit components must vary based on the nominally rated HID lamp voltage. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an HID ballast having a
