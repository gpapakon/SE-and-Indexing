<ABSTRACT>
A valve block assembly for controlling the flow 
of operating air to air operated mechanisms of a 

section of an I.S. machine comprising at least one 
valve block including a plurality of valves, each of 

the valves having an inlet chamber for receiving 
operating air, a conduit associated with each valve 

for directing operating air away from the valve 
towards the air operated mechanisms or for directing 

exhaust air from the air operated mechanism to the 
valve, and an exhaust channel for directing exhaust 

air away from the valves, and a manifold including 
means for supplying operating air to the inlet 

chambers, an exhaust channel for receiving exhaust 
air from the valve block exhaust channel, and a 

corresponding plurality of conduits communicating 
with the valve block conduits for delivering exhaust 

air from the air operated mechanisms to the valve 
block conduits or for directing operating air 

received from the valve block conduits towards the 
air operated mechanisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to I.S. (individual 
section) machines which make glass containers 
from molten gobs of glass. Each individual section of an I.S. machine has 
a blank side which forms a parison from the gob in a 
blank side mold and a blow side which forms the final 
glass container from the parison in a blow side mold. 
A number of movable mechanisms such as a blank side 
mold opening and closing mechanism, a plunger 
mechanism to be moved into a gob contained within the 
blank side mold, an invert mechanism for taking the 
formed parison and carrying it to the blow side, a 
blow side mold opening and closing mechanism, a 
takeout for removing the formed glass container from 
the blow side and depositing it on a dead plate and 
a pusher which will displace a bottle from the dead 
plate onto a conveyor are associated with each 
section and these mechanisms require air having a 
variety of pressures. To control the application of this air, each 
section has a valve block which supports a number of 
on/off valves which are operated by electronically 
controlled solenoids. A prior art valve block is 
shown in U.S. Patents numbered 3,918,489 and 
4,382,451. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved valve block for a section of an 
I.S. machine. The invention generally comprises a valve block 
assembly for controlling the flow of operating air to 
air operated mechanisms of a section of an I.S. 
machine comprising
 
   at least one valve block including
 
      a plurality of valves,
 
      each of the valves having an inlet chamber  
 
for receiving operating air,
 
      a conduit associated with each valve for 
directing operating air away from the valve towards 
an air operated mechanism or for directing exhaust 
air from the air operated mechanism to the valve, and
 
      an exhaust channel for directing exhaust 
air away from the valves, and
 
   a manifold including
 
      means for supplying operating air to the 
inlet chambers,
 
      an exhaust channel for receiving exhaust 
air from the valve block exhaust channel, and
 
      a corresponding plurality of conduits 
communicating with the valve block conduits for 
delivering exhaust air from the air operated 
mechanisms to the valve block conduits or for 
directing operating air received from the valve block 
conduits towards the air operated mechanisms. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following 
portion of this specification and from the 
accompanying
