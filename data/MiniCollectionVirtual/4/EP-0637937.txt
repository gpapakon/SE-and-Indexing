<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasound catheter (10) is disclosed for providing substantially real-time images of small cavities. The ultrasound catheter (10) is characterized by separate and distinct materials for backing the transducers (22) and for carrying the electronics components (18). The separate materials comprise an electronics carrier (20) meeting the requirements for holding the integrated circuitry (18) of the ultrasound device and a backing material (24) displaying superior characteristics relating to reducing ringing and minimizing the effect of other sources of signal degradation in the transducer assembly. Also, in accordance with the present invention, a technique is described for connecting the conductor lines of the separate transducer assembly and electronics body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ultrasound catheter probe according to the preamble of claim 1.
The invention refers more particularly to ultrasonic
imaging to determine various characteristics of relatively
small cavities and surrounding fluids and structures.
Such a catheter probe is known from US-A-4917097.Diagnosis and treatment of fully or partially blocked
arteries of the heart is essential in the medical
profession's endeavor to prevent heart attacks. Physicians
have successfully prevented heart attacks arising from
artery blockage caused by the build-up of plaque upon the
walls of the coronary arteries through the use of
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA,
commonly referred to as "balloon angioplasty"). Balloon
angioplasty involves carefully threading a catheter into
the affected portion of the artery. After the balloon
portion is determined to be properly positioned in the
artery, the physician inflates the expandable portion of
the catheter in order to broaden the blocked or narrowed
passage in the blood vessel caused by the deposition of
plaque upon the artery wall.The desirability of using an imaging device to produce
treatment and diagnostic quality images of small enclosed
areas such as human blood vessels on a diagnostic video
display device is unquestioned. It is known to use a very
small ultrasonic imaging device mounted at the end of a 
catheter to produce a real-time image of the internal walls
of a coronary artery. This device is referred to herein as
an ultrasound catheter.In the known ultrasound catheters, the same material
is used for the electronics carrier upon which a set of
electronic components are mounted and for the backing
material for the transducer assembly. A drawback to the
known ultrasound catheters is the difficulty in finding a
carrier/backing material which provides the physical and
acoustic qualities desired for advantageous use as the
carrier for the electronics and the backing material for a
transducer assembly comprising a highly sensitive
transducer material.The known ultrasonic catheter structure, though
providing the advantage of design and construction
simplicity, exhibits certain drawbacks attributable to the
particular and mutually incompatible requirements for the
backing material and the electronics carrier. It is
desirable that the electronics carrier for the electronics
body be rigid and capable of withstanding the elevated
temperatures produced by the electronics. However, the
known electronics carrier materials which satisfy the
require
