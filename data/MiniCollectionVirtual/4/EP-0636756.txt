<ABSTRACT>
Resiliently compliant floor (1), in particular for sports halls, which is formed, on its upper side, by parquetry elements (2) which are borne by spaced-apart, mutually parallel springing boards (3). The springing boards (3) are supported on a subfloor (8) via elastic supporting bodies in the form of lamellae (7). The parquetry elements (2) have a wearing layer comprising strips (5) and have a load-bearing layer (6) comprising small boards running transversely with respect to the strips. The lamellae (7), which are designed in the form of rigidly elastic plates, are fixed on the underside of the springing boards (3), and the underside (10) of the lamellae is inclined with respect to the subfloor, at least in the non-loaded rest state of the floor. When the floor is in the non-loaded rest state, said lamellae (7) are supported on the subfloor (8) by an edge (11). The lamellae preferably consist of wood.

A resilient floor, in particular for gymnasiums, formed by 
parquet elements (2) on its upper side, which parquet elements 

are supported by spaced, parallely extending swinging boards (3) 
which in turn are supported on a sub-floor (8) via elastic 

supporting bodies, the parquet elements (2) comprising an upper 
wear layer (4) of parallel strip-match-boarding elements (5) and 

a supporting layer (6) located below this wear layer and formed 
of small boards extending transversely to the strip-match-boarding 

elements, characterised in that the supporting bodies 
are formed by lamellae designed as stiff-elastic plates arranged 

on the lower side (9) of the swinging boards (3) and having one 
rim (14) thereof fixed to the swinging boards (3) and obliquely 

projecting from the swinging boards (3) from this rim (14) 
onwards, the lower side (10) of the lamellae (7) extending 

inclinedly relative to the sub-floor (8), at least in the 
unloaded at-rest position of the floor (1), and the lamellae (7) 

being supported with one edge (11) thereof on the sub-floor (8) 
in the unloaded at-rest position of the floor (1), and that with 

an increasing load on the floor (1), the lamellae (7) become 
deformed starting from this edge (11) and become more adapted to 

the sub-floor (8). 
A floor according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
lamellae (7) are made of wood. 
A floor according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
region of the lower side (9) of the swinging boards (3) facing 

the respective lamella (7) forms a cambered supporting face 
preferably having a radius of curvature which increases from the 

site of fixation of the respective lamella (7) onwards, the 
lamella (7), with the load thereon increasing, progressively 

coming to abut on the cambered supporting face. 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that grooves (16) are provided at the lower 

side (9) of the swinging boards (3), the lamellae (7) being 
fixed in these grooves with one rim (14) thereof.  

 
A floor according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
lamellae (7) are glued into the grooves (16). 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a ledge (26) is arranged below the rim 

(14) of the lamellae (7) to be fixed to the swinging boards (3), 
which ledge is connected with the swinging boards by nails, 

screws, clamps or the like for the fixation of the lamellae. 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the lamellae (7) extend towards both 

sides, departing from the middle of the lower side (9) of the 
swinging boards (3) where they are fixed. 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that a plurality of lamellae is fixed to the 

individual swinging boards (3), which lamellae are consecutively 
arranged in the longitudinal direction of the lamellae (7) in 

spaced relation to each other. 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that a sliding foil (25) is arranged between 

the lamellae (7) and the sub-floor (8). 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the edges (11) of the lamellae (7) 

supported on the sub-floor (8) are retained on the sub-floor (8) 
by clamps (17) covering these edges (11) and allowing for a 

limited transverse shifting of these edges (11). 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that at least part of the parquet elements (2) 

are detachably connected with the swinging boards (3) by screws 
(20) or by groove-and-tongue connections (21, 22, 23). 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that it is provided with heating tubes (31) 

arranged on the lower side of heat distribution metal sheets  
 

(32) which in turn are retained with both sides on the upper 
side (34) of neighbouring swinging boards (3) thereby bridging 

the distance between neighbouring swinging boards (3). 
A floor according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that it is provided with heating tubes (31) 

mounted to the upper side of tray-shaped heat distribution metal 
sheets (38), which in turn are inserted between neighbouring 

swinging boards at the level of the swinging boards (3).
