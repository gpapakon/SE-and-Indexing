<ABSTRACT>
The soldering of electronic components to a 
printed circuit board on which they are mounted by 

means of wave soldering in an inert gas atmosphere is 
carried out using a soldering flux which contains a 

carboxylic acid which melts at a temperature in the 
range of from 75 to 250°C, preferably 110 to 200°C and 

which thermally decomposes and/or volatilises at wave 
soldering temperatures of 230 to 260°C, to leave 

neutral residues, the carboxylic acid having low water 
solubility and being selected from 


(i) α-unsaturated carboxylic acids of general 
formula: 


(ii) carboxylic acids containing conjugated double 
bonds and of general formula: 


and (iii) aromatic carboxylic acids of general formula: 

wherein R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄, R₅, R₆, R₇, R₈ and R₉ denote H, 
alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclic, aryl, heterocyclic 

aromatic, OR₁₀, NR₁₁R₁₂, or CO₂R₁₃ wherein R₁₀, R₁₁, 
R₁₂ and R₁₃ independently of one another are H, alkyl, 

cycloalkyl, heterocyclic, aryl or heterocyclic 
aromatic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the soldering of 
electronic components and is principally concerned with 
the soldering of such components, when mounted on a 
printed circuit board (PCB), by means of wave soldering 
in an inert gas atmosphere. One commercially popular method of mass producing 
PCB's involves the use of a wave soldering machine in 
which a molten solder wave is caused to come into 
contact with a PCB carrying electronic components as it 
passes through the machine so as to cause the 
components to become soldered to the PCB in the 
required locations after the PCB has emerged from the 
solder wave and the solder has solidified. 
Conventionally, wave soldering has been effected under 
an oxygen-containing atmosphere, that is air, using a 
solder alloy which is a tin-lead eutectic, i.e. a 
63:37 Sn/Pb alloy, or a close alloy thereto, e.g. a 
60:40 Sn/Pb. To ensure adequate wetting and bonding of 
the solder on the PCB, it is normally necessary to 
apply a flux material to the PCB which contains 
components for achieving both such objectives and 
results in the formation of flux residues which may 
then need to be removed, generally by cleaning with an 
organic solvent such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) which 
gives rise to environmental problems. When wave soldering is conducted in air, oxide 
which is formed on the solder wave intermixes with 
solder to form dross which must be removed periodically 
from the solder bath. In order to avoid such dross 
formation and in order to reduce the need for employing 
a flux material of conventional type which produces 
flux residues in the wave soldering process, wave 
soldering of PCB's has recently been conducted in a 
non-oxidising atmosphere (generally < 10ppm oxygen), 
such as an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen (see "Inert  
 
Atmosphere Wave Soldering", Electronic Production, May 
1991, pp 11-12. The low solids liquid fluxes which do not require 
cleaning off with for example CFC's used in inert gas 
wave soldering, as with liquid fluxes, generally, 
contain carboxylic acid activators dissolved in a 
solvent selected from low molecular weight alcohols. 
The formulation optionally contains a resin, a 
corrosion inhibitor, other solvents of higher boiling 
point and wetting agents. In resin-free products, the 
carboxylic acid is selected from materials which are 
molten at wave soldering temperatures of approximately 
250°C, are easily decomposed or volatilised and have 
low water solubility. As a consequence of this, many 
formulations make use of acids such
