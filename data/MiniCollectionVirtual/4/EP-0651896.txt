<ABSTRACT>
The ARC/INFO3 geographic information system (GIS) computer program (28) supports multiple threads of command line (TTY) and graphic user interface (GUI) operations. A TTY operation at the top of a thread enables the program (28) to be controlled from a keyboard (20) through a terminal emulator (26), whereas a GUI operation at the top of a thread enables the program (28) to be controlled by a mouse (22) using a window display (24). Switching from TTY to GUI control of the program (28) in its stand-alone form requires a command from its input stream, whereas switching from GUI to TTY control requires a manual trigger from the mouse (22) or keyboard (20). A controller (44) of the invention normally enables GUI control by inserting a dummy GUI operation (50) including a dummy window as an artifact on top of a TTY operation (46) in a thread (48). In response to a TTY command from the keyboard (20) or a user program, the controller (44) deletes the dummy window, causing the dummy GUI operation (50) to be deleted from the thread (48) and enabling TTY control from the keyboard (20). The controller (44) then feeds the command to the program (28), and inserts the dummy GUI operation (50) back on top of the TTY operation (46) in the thread (48) to enable subsequent GUI control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the art of
computers, and more specifically to a controller for the
ARC/INFO® geographic information system (GIS) and similar
computer software programs which enables command line (TTY)
control using a keyboard and graphic user interface (GUI)
control using a mouse or keyboard without manual switching
by the user.ARC/INFO® is a mapping and geographic information system
(GIS) computer software program which is commercially
available from Environmental Systems Research Institute
(ESRI), Inc. of Redlands, CA. ARC/INFO is used to compose
and present maps overlaid with geographic and other information
in the forms of alphanumeric characters and icons.
A comprehensive introduction to ARC/INFO is presented in a
promotional brochure entitled "ARC/INFO®: GIS Today and
Tomorrow", ESRI WHITE PAPER SERIES, Environmental Research
Institute, Inc., Sept. 1992.ARC/INFO is provided with a graphic user interface 
(GUI) and a toolkit which enables custom windows and menus
to be created by the user for semi-automated execution of
specific applications using a mouse or other pointing device,
or a keyboard.The general configuration of ARC/INFO® in its stand-alone
form as installed for use in a general purpose computer
is illustrated in FIG. 1. A computer system 10 includes
a computer 12 which preferably runs under the UNIX®
operating system in a standard X-windows environment, although
the invention is not so limited. The computer 12
includes a keyboard 20, mouse 22 and video display monitor
24.The computer system 10 further includes a program
software system 16, which includes a conventional X-server
18 for controlling input, output and display operations for
the keyboard 20, mouse 22 and monitor 24.The software system 16 further includes a terminal
emulator 26 for processing command line (TTY) inputs from
the keyboard 20 under control of the X-server 18 and feeding
them to the ARC/INFO system program which is designated
as 28. The X-server 18 directs graphic control (GUI) inputs
from the mouse 22 and keyboard 20 to the program 28,
and feeds display outputs from the program 28 to the monitor
24.Although the system 10 including ARC/INFO in its
stand-alone form enables both TTY control using the keyboard
20 and GUI control using the mouse 22, it must be
manually switched back and forth between these two modes of
control. Switching from TTY to GUI control requires manually
issuing a command from the keyboard 20, whereas
switching from GUI to TTY control requires manually clicking
on a

<CLAIMS>
A computer system (40) including a computer
(12) and a main program (28) which support multiple threads

of operations and in which a TTY operation at the top of
any thread supersedes GUI operations at the tops of all

other threads, said main program (28) inserting a TTY control
operation (46) at the top of a first thread (48); and a

program controller (44) for enabling command line (TTY) and
graphic user interface (GUI) control of said main program

(28), characterised in that said program controller comprises:

a setup unit (62) for inserting a dummy GUI operation
(50) on top of said TTY control operation (46) in

said first thread (48) to cause said main program (28) to
be normally controlled by a GUI control operation in a second

thread; and
a wake-up unit (60,64,66) for, in response to a
TTY control command, removing said dummy GUI operation (50)

from said first thread (48) to cause said main program (28)
to be controlled by said TTY control operation (46), feeding

said TTY control command to said main program (28), and
inserting said dummy GUI operation (50) on top of said TTY

control operation (46) in said first thread (48) to cause
said main program (28) to be subsequently controlled by

said GUI control operation in said second thread.
The computer system as in claim 1, in which
said main program (28) is Arc/Info®.
The computer system as in claim 1, in which
said dummy GUI operation (50) comprises a dummy window as

an artifact.
The computer system (44) as in claim 3, in
which: 


the computer (12) comprises a display controller
(18) for inserting and deleting windows for display; and
the wake-up unit (60,64,66) removes said dummy
GUI operation (50) from said first thread by sending a

command to the display controller to delete said dummy
window.
The computer system as in claim 1, in
which:

   the wake-up unit (60,64,66) inserts said dummy
GUI operation (50) on top of said TTY control operation

(46) in said first thread (48) by sending a command to said
main program (28) to create said dummy GUI operation (50).
The computer system as in claim 5, in which
said program (28) is Arc/Info®.
The computer system as in claim 1, in which
said TTY control operation (46) comprises a standard input

and a standard output for said program (28).
The computer system as in claim 1, further
comprising a terminal emulator (26) for generating said TTY

control command.
The computer system as in claim 1, in which
said TTY control command is generated by an aux
iliary program.
The computer system as in claim 9, in
which:


said main program (28) generates graphic data;
and
said auxiliary program generates said TTY control
command for updating said graphic data.
