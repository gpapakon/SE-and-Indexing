<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method for enhancing the immune response of a mammal to a vaccine comprising administering to such a mammal an effective amount of GM-CSF in conjunction with a vaccine. The present invention further provides for a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of GM-CSF, a natural, synthetic or recombinant antigen and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF GM-CSF AS A VACCINE APTUVANTF E OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the use of granulocyte- macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), particularly human GM-CSF, as a vaccine adjuvant.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONActive immunization is the administration of an antigen to an animal to bring about an immune response in the animal. A vaccine against a microorganism is an antigenic preparation which when inoculated into a non-immune individual will confer active immunity to the microorganism but will not cause disease. Specificity and memory, the two key elements of the adaptive immune system, are exploited in vaccination, since the adaptive immune system mounts a much stronger response on second encounter with an antigen. This secondary immune response is both faster to appear and more effective than the primary response. The principle of vaccine development is to alter a microorganism or its toxins (natural antigens) in such a way that they become innocuous without losing antigenicity. Alternatively, antigenic polypeptides of the organism in question can be produced by recombinant methods or by synthetic chemistry to produce an effective vaccine.One problem that frequently is encountered in the course of active immunization is that the antigens used in the vaccine are not sufficiently immunogenic to raise an antibody titer to sufficient levels to provide protection against subsequent challenge, or to maintain the potential for mounting these levels over extended time periods. Another problem is that the vaccine may be deficient in inducing cell- mediated immunity which is a primary immune defense against 

bacterial and viral infection. Still another problem is that an individual patient might be immunosuppressed.To obtain a stronger humoral and/or cellular response, it is common to administer a vaccine in a formulation containing an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance that enhances, nonspecifically, the immune response to an antigen, or which causes an individual to respond to an antigen who would otherwise without the adjuvant not respond to the antigen. An adjuvant is usually administered with an antigen, but may also be given before or after antigen administration. Suitable adjuvants for the vaccination of mammals include but are not limited to Adjuvant 65 (containing peanut oil, mannide monooleate and aluminum monostearate); Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant; mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and alum; surfactants such as hexadecylamine,
