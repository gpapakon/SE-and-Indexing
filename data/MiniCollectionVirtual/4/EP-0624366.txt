<ABSTRACT>

administration contains tramadol, or a pharmaceutically 

acceptable salt thereof, as active ingredient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a controlled release preparation for oral administration, 
to processes for its preparation and to its medical use. In particular, the invention 
relates to a controlled release preparation comprising tramadol or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof. Tramadol, which has the chemical name (±)-trans-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl) 
cyclohexanol, is an orally active opioid analgesic. Conventional 
release preparations in the form of capsules, drops and suppositories containing 
tramadol, or more particularly its hydrochloride salt, have been commercially available 
for many years for use in the treatment of moderate to severe pain; Such preparations, 
however, do not provide a controlled release of the tramadol. Moreover, despite 
tramadol's long-standing use, controlled release preparations for oral administration 
containing tramadol as active ingredient have not even previously been described in the 
literature. It is an object of the present invention to provide an oral controlled release tramadol 
preparation suitable for at least twelve-hourly (e.g. up to twenty-four hourly) 
administration for the treatment of pain. The present invention therefore provides a controlled release preparation comprising 
tramadol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for oral administration. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of tramadol for use according to the present 
invention are those conventionally known in the art such as pharmaceutically acceptable 
acid addition salts. The hydrochloride salt is particularly preferred. A controlled release preparation according to the present invention is one that achieves 
slow release of a drug over an extended period of time, thereby extending the duration 
of drug action over that achieved by conventional delivery. Preferably such a 
preparation maintains a drug concentration in the blood within the therapeutic range for 
12 hours or more.  
 The dissolution rate in vitro upon release of the controlled release 
preparation for administration twice daily according to the invention, is between 5 and 
50% (by weight) tramadol released after 1 hour, between 10 and 75% (by weight) 
tramadol released after 2 hours, between 20 and 95% (by weight) tramadol released 
after 4 hours, between 40 and 100% (by weight) tramadol released after 8 hours, more 
than 50% (by weight) tramadol released after 12 hours, more than 70% (by weight) 
released after 18 hours and more than 80% (by weight) tramadol released after 24 
ho
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>

twelve hours containing 50 to 400mg of tramadol or pharmaceutically 

acceptable salt thereof (calculated as hydrochloride) in a controlled release 
matrix, the matrix containing between 1 and 80% w/w of one or more 

hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers, preferably a cellulose ether, and having 
the following dissolution rate

vitro
 when measured using the PH. Eur. 
Paddle Method at 100rpm in 900ml 0.1 N hydrochloric acid at 37°C and using 

UV detection at 270nm ;
 
between 5 and 50% (by weight) tramadol released after 1 hour,
 
between 10 and 75% (by weight) tramadol released after 2 hours,
 
between 20 and 95% (by weight) tramadol released after 4 hours,
 
between 40 and 100% (by weight) tramadol released after 8 hours,
 
more than 50% (by weight) tramadol released after 12 hours,
 
more than 70% (by weight) tramadol released after 18 hours,
 
more than 80% (by weight) tramadol released after 24 hours. 
A dosage form according to Claim 1 characterised in that the controlled 
release matrix comprises a cellulose ether which is an alkyl cellulose. 
A dosage form according to Claim 1 characterised in that the controlled 
release matrix comprises at least one alkyl, preferably C₁ to C₆, alkyl cellulose, 

and at least one C₁₂ to C₃₆, preferably C₁₄ to C₂₂, aliphatic alcohol and, 
optionally at least one polyalkyleneglycol, preferably polyethylene glycol. 
A dosage form according to Claim 3, characterised in that the at least one 
alkylcellulose is ethylcellulose.  

 
A dosage form according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the dosage 
form contains from 1 to 20% w/w, preferably 2 to 15% w/w of one or more 

alkyl-celluloses. 
A dosage form according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the 
aliphatic alcohol comprises lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, or 

preferably cetyl alcohol or cetostearyl alcohol. 
A dosage form according to any one of Claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the 
dosage form contains from 5 to 30% w/w of aliphatic alcohol, preferably from 

10 to 25% w/w of aliphatic alcohol.
