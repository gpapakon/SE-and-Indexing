The method comprises a biological conversion process so as to obtain a biologically stable fertilizer solution. This conversion process includes at least a nitrification step wherein nitrifiable ammonium nitrogen is converted in nitrate nitrogen and, only if the fraction to be nitrified has a too high content of nitrifiable nitrogen, a denitrification step. The fertilizer solution is separated off after the nitrification step so that it contains nitrate and only up to 150 mg NH4

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for processing a liquid nitrogen rich organic waste
product to an aqueous solution, in which method said
waste product is subjected to a biological conversion
process so as to obtain a biologically substantially
stable aqueous solution, which conversion process
includes at least a nitrification step wherein
nitrifiable ammonium nitrogen from said waste product is
converted into nitrate nitrogen in a nitrification
reactor by means of nitrifying bacteria, in the event
the nitrate content in the so-obtained nitrified fraction
would exceed a predetermined nitrogen content, said
nitrate content is limited to a content at which said
nitrifying bacteria are active by subjecting at least a
portion of a previously nitrified fraction to a
denitrification step and subsequently to said nitrification
step together with a further fraction which is to
be nitrified.The expression "liquid nitrogen rich
organic waste product" used in this patent application
refers in particular to liquid manure products as
obtained directly onto the farms, for example semi-liquid
manure, liquid manure and the like, but possibly
also further processing products of these manure products
such as for example the aqueous fraction obtained
after removal of the solid fraction out of semi-liquid
manure or the rest products obtained after a partial
fermentation of the manure product, for example for the
production of biogas. Of course, also manure products 
of human origin are comprised under this expression.
Further the expression also embraces other liquid
nitrogen rich organic waste products such as for example
waste water from composting installations.EP-A-0 423 889 in the name of one of both
applicants discloses already a method for processing
semi-liquid manure or fermented semi-liquid manure of
the hereabove indicated type. In this known method, use
is made of a water purification installation wherein the
manure product is subjected successively to a nitrification
step and subsequently to a denitrification step so
as to obtain a purified aqueous solution wherein the
nitrogen and the organic matter are eliminated as much
as possible since the denitrified fraction is
subsequently discharged.In order to eliminate the nitrogen from
the manure as completely as possible, a portion of the
denitrified fraction is recycled to the nitrification
reactor in such a manner that the nitrate content in
this reactor is preferably limited to between 1000 and
1400 mg NO3-N/l. Within these limits, an optimal
conversion
