<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device for detecting radiation includes a plurality of quantum well layers, each of which has bound ground and excited states, interleaved with a plurality of superlattice barrier layers, each of which has a miniband of energy states. By selection of the thicknesses and compositions of the layers, the excited states of the quantum wells have energies that are approximately equal to energies of states in the minibands. Thus, the excited states and minibands form a band of energy states that is substantially continuous across the pluralities of layers. Carriers are excited from the quantum wells' ground states to the excited states by photon absorption and are swept into and through the minibands by an externally applied electric field. The carriers are collected as photocurrent. The excited states may be selectively positioned in the minibands to tailor the properties of the devices, which can have both n-type and p-type dopants. Devices that respond to more than one wavelength band are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a semiconductor electromagnetic
detector and a method of detecting electromagnetic radiation, and is directed
particularly to a semiconductor infrared detector having doped quantum wells
separated by finite-period superlattices.Detection of electromagnetic radiation in the medium wavelength
infrared (MWIR) band (wavelengths from 3-5 micrometers (µm)) can be accomplished
with several materials, e.g., indium antimonide (InSb). On the other hand, there is
only one common detector for the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) band
(wavelengths from 8-12 µm): the narrow-band-gap semiconductor mercury cadmium
telluride (HgCdTe).Many problems with respect to the uniformity of optical and electrical
properties and mechanical stability are associated with HgCdTe. As a result, routine
fabrication of large HgCdTe detector arrays is not possible. In addition, detectors
that are sensitive to more than one band of wavelengths at the same time (sometimes
called "two-color" detectors) are not readily available.Recently, semiconductor structures that have dimensions small enough
to make quantum mechanical effects important have been described in the literature,
e.g., M. Sundaram et al., "New Quantum Structures", Science vol. 254, pp. 1326-1335
(Nov. 29, 1991). Conventional quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs)
respond to thermal radiation with an increase in electrical conductivity that results
from internal photoemission of charged carriers from energy states confined in 
quantum wells. Typical materials used for conventional QWIPs are III-V compound
semiconductors such as gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. A typical
QWIP is a stack of layers in which the layers' materials and widths are carefully
selected to achieve a desired distribution of energy states for the device's electrons.
See, e.g., B. Levine et al., "New 10 µm Infrared Detector Using Intersubband
Absorption in Resonant Tunneling GaAlAs Superlattices", Appl. Phys. Lett. vol. 50,
pp. 1092-1094 (Apr. 20, 1987).An example of the energy states in a conventional, unbiased QWIP
such as that described in the Levine et al. paper is illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
General aspects of superlattices, which typically
are structures of thin alternating layers of two materials having different electronic
properties, are described in G. Dohler, "Solid-State Superlattices", Scientific
American vol. 249, pp. 144-151 (Nov. 1983). It will be understood that
superlattices, as well as the other structures described in this
