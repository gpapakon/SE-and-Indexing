<ABSTRACT>
A zinc tranexamate compound represented by formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid salt thereof. 
This compound exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcerous activities even when administered at a dose smaller than that of tranexamic 

acid or cetraxate hydrochloride, and is easy to administer because it is tasteless and odorless. The organic acid salt is water-soluble 
and hence can be used in liquid form as injection or external preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel zinc tranexamate 
compound and its pharmacologically acceptable organic acid 
salts, to a process for producing the same and to 
anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer agents which individually 
contain the same as an active ingredient. Tranexamic acid inhibits the bonding of plasminogen or 
plasmin with fibrin to lower their fibrinolytic activities, 
and thus suppress bleeding. By way of such a mechanism, the 
compound suppresses vascular fragility and also develops 
anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activities. Specifically, 
the compound is considered to be effective against hyperemia, 
reddening, swelling and ache accompanying tosillitis, 
pharyngo-laryngitis, stomatitis, aphtha in the mucosa of the 
mouth. However, no report has been made so far on the 
anti-gastritic and anti-peptic/duodenal ulcer activities of 
tranexamic acid, with no paper being published on the 
synthesis and pharmacological activities of zinc tranexamate. The present Inventors have found that zinc tranexamate, 
among others, exhibits distinctly marked anti-ulcer and anti-gastritis 
activities. The present invention provides a novel zinc tranexamate 
compound as represented by the formula (I): 
  
 
and its pharmacologically acceptable salts with organic acids, 
a process for producing the same and an anti-inflammatory 
agent and anti-ulcer agent which individually contain the same 
as an active ingredient. The compound of formula (I) is produced by reacting a 
tranexamic acid of formula (II): 
 
with an alkali agent and zinc compound. Referring to the 
alkali agent, there may preferably be used alkali metal 
alcoholates such as sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, 
potassium methylate, potassium ethylate and potassium 
t-butoxide. As the zinc compound, use is normally made of 
zinc salts soluble in a reaction solvent such as zinc acetate, 
zinc chloride, zinc bromide and zinc iodide, but other zinc 
compounds may be utilized. The reaction is preferably carried 
out in a water-free solvent and is normally conducted in a 
suitable solvent such as methanol and ethanol at room 
temperature or under heating for several minutes to several 
hours. After the conclusion of the reaction, the compound of 
the formula (I) that crystallizes out can be purified by 
conventional means. The present invention comprehends pharmacologically 
allowable organic-acid salts of the compound of the formula 
(I), and their examples include salts with aliphatic 
carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid; glycolic acid,
