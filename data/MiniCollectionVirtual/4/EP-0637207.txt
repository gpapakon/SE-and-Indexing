<DESCRIPTION>
Frozen gas-containing dessert products or confections are 
well-known. Usually the gas-content, expressed as 
percentage overrun, varies from 10 to 30% for sherbets to 
60 to 100% for ice cream corresponding with bulk density 
ranges of from 0.77 to 0.9 g/ml and of from 0.5 to 0.63 
g/ml respectively. Attempts to increase the overrun for obtaining warmer 
eating products or other special effects were not without 
result but inevitably resulted in unacceptable shrinkage or 
deformations when storing those products. This could only 
be partly remedied by using larger amounts of additives 
such as stabilizers, the level of which from a consumer 
point of view should however be kept as low as possible. Document US-A-3 968 266 discloses a low density frozen dessert. It is an object of the invention to provide a frozen high-overrun 
dessert or confection of low bulk density devoid of 
these shrinkage and deformation problems. The expression 
"low-bulk density products" in the present specification 
and claims is defined as a product having a bulk density 
below 0.45 g/ml and down to 0.09 g/ml and in particular 
below 0.33 g/ml, in practice say down to 0.17 g/ml. A 
requirement of this product being that it can be stored in 
a usual manner, such as by keeping it in a cold store of - 
25°C to -40°C in a freezing cabinet of about -18°C and 
below, or in a display cabinet where the temperature may be 
some degrees higher than this, keeping in mind that in 
commercial freezing cabinets temperature fluctuations of 
several degrees centigrade are not unusual. A further object of the invention is to provide frozen 
dessert products having a new structure and texture. The 
invention provides thereto frozen low bulk density desserts 
or confections, having a thermal transition temperature in 
excess of -18°C and in particular in excess of -13°C. This  
 
transition is sometimes referred to as the glass transition 
temperature (Tg) and will be described later. In practice, 
the thermal transition temperature of frozen dessert 
material according to the invention will normally be below 
-2°C and more usually below -6°C and in particular below - 
8°C. Frozen gas-containing desserts having such a relatively 
high thermal transition temperature can be aerated to a 
much lower bulk density than usual without the expected 
risk of high shrinkage which will be experienced with 
highly aerated frozen dessert products of usual 
composition, ie without excessive amounts of additives. 
That is, the water solidifies as an amorphous
