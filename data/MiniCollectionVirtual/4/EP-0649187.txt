<CLAIMS>
A molding of a thermoplastic material reinforced
with metal fibers, with at least one electric

contact, wherein the contacts comprise a metal
covering which is connected to the molding by three-cornered

prongs (3), the prongs (3) penetrating the
less conductive layer on the surface of the molding.
The molding as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
prongs (3) have the form of isosceles triangles.
The molding as claimed in claim 1, wherein, instead
of by three-cornered prongs (3), the metal covering

is connected to the molding by means of metal chips
which penetrate the surface.
The molding as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the molding has the form of a board and the

metal covering is clamped on both sides of the
board.
The molding as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
three-cornered prongs (3) of the metal covering are

arranged offset on both sides of the molding (6) in
board form. 
The molding as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein the
molding is cylindrical and the metal covering has

the form of a pipe clip.
The molding as claimed in any one of claims 1-6,
wherein the penetration of the prongs (3) or metal

chips is facilitated by heating the surface or
penetration into the surface which is still warm

from processing.
