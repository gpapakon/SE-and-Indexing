<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric filter comprises a dielectric block having through 
bores running from an end face to the opposite thereof and grooves 

arranged between adjacent through bores on a side thereof, whereas the 
opposite side of said dielectric filter is uniformly flat and free of 

grooves so that the dielectric block may be suspended, moved and easily 
mounted on a printed-circuit board by means of a suction pad having a 

large effective sucking area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dielectric filter having a
configuration particularly suited for mounting it on a printed-circuit
board. Such a dielectric filter can suitably be used for
telecommunications equipment such as portable telephone or mobile
telephone.Figs. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings illustrate a known
interdigital tripole type dielectric filter comprising a substantially
rectangularly parallelepipedic dielectric block 1 typically made of a
ceramic material, through which a total of three holes 2a through 2c are
bored from an end face to the opposite. The through bores 2a through 2c
are provided on the inner peripheral surface with respective internal
conductors 3a through 3c, while an external conductor 4 is arranged on a
lateral side of the dielectric block 1. Said oppositely disposed end
faces of the dielectric block 1 carrying the openings of the through
bores are divided into conductive short-circuiting surface sections 5a
through 5c for electrically connecting respective ends of said internal
conductors 3a through 3c and the external conductor 4 and open-circuiting
surface sections 6a through 6c for electrically insulating the respective
other ends of the inner conductors 3a through 3c from the external
conductor 4, said surface sections 5a through 5c and 6a through 6c being
interdigitally arranged in a manner as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. A
pair of L-shaped input/output terminals 7a and 7b are arranged on a side
of the dielectric block 1 and electrically connected with the
corresponding extreme through bores 2a and 2b via conductive holes 8a and 
8b respectively and straight grooves 9a through 9d are formed on a pair
of oppositely disposed sides or top and bottom sides of the dielectric
block 1 between any two adjacent through bores, running in parallel with
the through bores between said opposite end faces. The grooves 9a, 9c
and 9d are arranged to regulate the degree of interstage coupling of the
internal conductors 3a through 3c that operates as resonators.The dielectric filter having a configuration as described above is
then arranged on a printed-circuit board p as illustrated in Fig. 3 and
soldered to the latter at ml and m2, the input/output terminals 7a and 7b
being respectively connected to input/output circuits s1 and s2.For mounting such a conventional dielectric filter on a printed-circuit
board p, as shown in Fig. 3, a suction pad t connected to a
suction pump (not shown) is applied to the top (the side opposite to the
one where the input/output terminals are

<CLAIMS>
A dielectric filter comprising a dielectric block
(11) having end surfaces, a top surface, a bottom

surface and lateral side surfaces and being secured to
a printed circuit board (p) with the bottom surface,

in which the dielectric block (11) includes a
plurality of through bores (12a, 12b, 12c) arranged to

be extended between the end surfaces thereof, each of
the through bores (12a, 12b, 12c) has an inner

peripheral surface provided with an internal conductor
(13a, 13b, 13c), an external conductor (14) is

provided on the lateral side surfaces of the
dielectric block (11), a pair of L-shaped input/output

terminals (17a, 17b) are arranged to be extended from
the lateral side surfaces to the bottom surface of the

dielectric block (11), such that the input/output
terminals (17a, 17b) are connected with corresponding

input/output circuits of the printed circuit board
(p), and parallel grooves (19a, 19b) are arranged on

the bottom surface of the dielectric block (11)
between two adjacent through bores for regulating the

degree of interstage coupling, characterised in that
the top surface (20) of the dielectric block (11) is

uniformly flat and free of grooves for regulating the
degree of interstage coupling.
A dielectric filter as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein each of the grooves (19a, 19b) arranged on the

bottom surface of the dielectric block (11) for
regulating the degree of interstage coupling has a

depth not greater than four-fifths of the height of
the dielectric block (11).
