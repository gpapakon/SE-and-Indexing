<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the application relates to a method in which a generally inordinate cell stream (ICS) is supplied to a cell memory (CM) which, as a rule, is centrally administered, and is temporally stored in this memory and in which path identification sequence numbers (VPI/SN) are derived from the cells of the supplied cell stream and are supplied to a resequencing control (RC) in which addresses (ADR) for addressing the cell memory (CM) are formed in such a manner that an ordinate cell stream (OOCS) is produced at the output of the cell memory. The subject matter of the application is used in ATM switching technology for switching networks in which cells of a connection pass through the switching network with different delay times.
