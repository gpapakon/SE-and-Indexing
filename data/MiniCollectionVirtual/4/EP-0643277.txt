<ABSTRACT>
A launder (10,11) for discharging melt from a metallurgical furnace 
(2) is disclosed which includes a launder body (10a,11a) having one end 

connected to the furnace. The launder body defines a fluid 
passageway for allowing the melt, flowing from the metallurgical 

furnace into said one end, to flow therethrough in a direction 
away from the furnace. The launder body includes a 

threshold portion (14) for determining the melt level in the furnace, 
above which the melt in the furnace begins to flow into 

the launder body. The launder body (10a,11a) further includes a closing 
portion (15) constructed to receive a closing material (6) thereon to 

close the fluid passageway of the launder body. The closing 
portion (15) is arranged at a position displaced downstream with 

respect to the threshold portion (14) and has a bottom lower than 
the threshold portion. Additionally, a metallurgical furnace 

installation using the above launder is disclosed, in which a 
pair of the launders are arranged while ensuring space for 

casting or removing operations of castable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to a launder for 
discharging melt from a metallurgical furnace and a metallurgical 
furnace installation using the same launder. In particular, 
the present invention relates to an improvement in the 
structure of the portion at which the melt passageway is temporarily 
closed by casting a closing material such as a lump of 
castable thereon. Figure 5 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a conventional 
melt discharging launder 1 connected to a converting 
furnace 2 for producing blister copper. In this known arrangement, 
the converting furnace 2 is constructed to have a circular 
furnace body 2a and a siphon type outlet 2b formed integrally 
therewith so as to be communicated with the furnace body 
2a. The conventional melt-discharging launder 1 is connected 
at one end to outlet 2b, while its other end is connected to an 
anode furnace (not shown). Thus, melt 3, i.e., blister copper 
melt, which is contained in the furnace body 2a, is caused to 
overflow or siphoned out from the top of the outlet 2b into the 
launder 1 when the melt level in the furnace body 2a exceeds 
the level of the launder 1, and slag 4 floating on the melt 3 
in the furnace body 2a is prevented from being discharged. In the aforesaid type of melt discharging launder 1, the 
portion in the immediate vicinity of the top of outlet 2b 
defines a threshold portion 5 for determining the melt level in  
 
furnace 2 above which the melt 3 in the furnace begins to 
overflow into the launder 1. In addition, when it is necessary 
to temporarily close the melt passageway of the launder 1, a 
prescribed quantity of castable 6 or refractory material is 
casted on the above threshold portion 5 to dam up the melt. 
The castable 6 thus casted should subsequently be removed in 
order to permit the flow of the melt once again. However, it has been very difficult to completely remove 
the castable on the threshold portion 5 because the castable 6 
adheres to a bottom 5a thereof. As a result, the castable 6 
gradually accumulates, thereby raising bottom 5a, such that 
melt level in the furnace 2, above which the melt in the furnace 
begins to overflow into the launder, will ultimately vary. Moreover, inasmuch as the threshold portion 5 is arranged 
adjacent to the outlet 2b, the casting operations of the castable 
6, which are performed mainly by human labor, are conducted 
in extremely hot environments caused by the emission of 
radiant heat from the melt 3, thereby rendering the operators 
with an
