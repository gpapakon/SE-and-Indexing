<DESCRIPTION>
Fuel expenses are one of the major costs
encountered by the trucking industry. In recent
years, many modifications have been implemented which
make trucks more energy e-fficient. For instance,
better fuel efficiency is being attained by
implementing more aerodynamic designs which offer a
lower coefficient of drag. Improved fuel efficiency
can also be attained by designing tires which display
less rolling resistance which also improves fuel
economy.In order to reduce the rolling resistance of a
tire, rubbers having a high rebound can be utilized in
making the tires' treads. Tires made with such
rubbers undergo less energy loss during rolling. The
traditional problem associated with this approach is
that the tire's wet traction and wet skid resistance
characteristics are compromised. This is because good
rolling resistance which favors low energy loss and
good traction characteristics which favor high energy
loss are viscoelastically inconsistent properties.In order to balance these two viscoelastically
inconsistent properties, mixtures of various types of
synthetic and natural rubber are normally utilized in
tire treads. For instance, various mixtures of
styrene-butadiene rubber and polybutadiene rubber are
commonly used as a rubbery material for automobile
tire treads. However, such blends are not totally
satisfactory for all purposes.US-A-4,843,120 discloses that tires
having improved performance characteristics can be
prepared by utilizing rubbery polymers having multiple
glass transition temperatures as the tread rubber.
These rubbery polymers having multiple glass 
transition temperatures exhibit a first glass
transition temperature which is within the range of
-110°C to -20°C and exhibit a second glass
transition temperature which is within the range of
-50°C to 0°C. According to US-A4,843,120,
these polymers are made by polymerizing at
least one conjugated diolefin monomer in a first
reaction zone at a temperature and under conditions
sufficient to produce a first polymeric segment having
a glass transition temperature which is between -110°C
and -20°C and subsequently continuing said
polymerization in a second reaction zone at a
temperature and under conditions sufficient to produce
a second polymeric segment having a glass transition
temperature which is between -20°C and 20°C. Such
polymerizations are normally catalyzed with an
organolithium catalyst and are normally carried out in
an inert organic solvent.US-A-5,137,998 discloses a
process for preparing a rubbery terpolymer of styrene,
isoprene
