<ABSTRACT>
An electronic board for cooperation with an IBM 
Compatible PC computer and a group of noise measuring 

instruments, for displaying side by side noise curves 
for various gear pairs of a gearbox for differing 

frequencies selected by filter means 
(15,21,20,17,19,18,23) in an audio band, to which the 

human ear is sensitive. 
A frequency sensitive, eg Fourier analysis is 
conducted continually at chosen rpm steps spaced over 

the desired range, in order to produce the curves. 
Noise inherent in a design of transmission, or only 

present in isolated samples thereof thereby denoting 
wear or other defect or damage, can thus be 

investigated, analyzed and possible remedies applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an electrical 
circuit, for cooperation with a set of noise sensitive electrical 
instruments and a computer to provide a stand-alone noise testing 
device. The circuit, according to a predetermined schedule of 
actuation or variation, and at predetermined time intervals, accepts 
and processes output signals from the test instruments for subsequent 
analysis by the computer. It is preferred that the present circuit be implemented as 
a single circuit board, and be locatable as an auxiliary unit in a 
suitable space or expansion slot of the computer. The circuit itself 
provides multipath, bi-directional communication, preferably through a 
single first plug/socket unit connection, with the PC, and further 
multipath, bi-directional communication, preferably through a single 
second plug/socket unit connection, with a set of test instruments. 
Preferably as many functions as possible are allotted to the standard 
facilities of the interconnected personal computer (PC) so that multi-pin 
plug and socket means may be used to communicate between the 
circuit board and the PC. Since various control signals required may 
be non-standard, these non-standard signals may be generated from 
unused standard address signals available from most PCs. Certain 
functions such as a clock, oscillator or keying signal may also be 
included as part of the present circuit for flexibility in adapting to 
certain PCs when these have non-standard locations or connector 
terminals for sources of these signals. The display facilities of the 
PC can be used to display test data, but the X and Y signals displayed 
may be analog signals derived either from certain address signals or 
from the instruments and their controls. One application of the present invention is testing 
gearboxes, such as heavy duty truck transmissions, for excessive noise 
or particular noise characteristics. A principal embodiment of the 
invention reads instruments, set up to sense varying test conditions in 
a machine, feeds X-Y signals to the computer for defining graphs, and 
processes and feeds to the computer signals derived from progressively 
varying readings of the instruments. The embodiment enables various 
frequency components to be analyzed, and preferably enables Fourier  
 
analyses to be graphed and displayed, stored or printed. Noise is becoming an increasingly bothersome hindrance to 
human comfort, and the most irritating frequency components and hence, 
sources of the noise can often be

<CLAIMS>
An electrical function insertion unit eg board, 
for cooperation with a computer which generates the 

usual address signals, and display means for varying 
signals, and with a set of analogue measuring 

instruments including sound detectors, characterized by 
filter means (15,21,20,17,19,18,23) so dimensioned as 

to shape the response over a range of audio frequencies 
similarly to a nominal sensitivity of the human ear to 

frequencies in said range; and frequency sensitive 
analyzing means (39-42) to deliver outputs (Iout) 

denoting components at discrete frequencies spaced over 
an audio band (eg 0-6 kHz). 
A board according to Claim 1 wherein the analyzing 
means selects the frequency components from the 

response curves of multiplexers (39,41) under control 
of timing pulses (DIN, ST). 
A board according to Claim 2 wherein the frequency 
band of observation (0- 6 kHz) is chosen in view of a 

sensitive portion of the human ear response and at 
least the second and third harmonics thereof. 
A board according to Claim 2 or 3 wherein the time 
base generator of the PC is swept to generate said 

varying signal sample rates. 
A board according to any preceding claim in 
combination with a PC or gearbox or transmission having 

microphones arranged therewith to generate ac noise 
 

signals which are applied via a multipin connector (1B) 
to the filter means (15,21,20,17,19,18,23). 
A board in combination with a transmission 
according to Claim 5, in which the transmission is 

equipped with instrumentation comprising said 
microphones, and some or all of a dc tachometer, 

accelerometers, and tachometer triggering means. 
A board in combination according to Claim 5 or 6 
comprising multi-screening means to display 

simultaneously noise derived from amplitude against 
frequency plots for various ratios of the transmission 

plotted over an audio range or sub-range of particular 
interest, eg including frequencies predicted to disturb 

the human ear (2 kHz, 3rd harmonics). 
A board in combination according to Claim 7 
wherein the multi-screening means displays adjacent to 

said plots also said derived noise developed over a 
much wider frequency band (eg white noise) than said 

audio range of particular interest.

to discover either (a) sources of unpleasant noise 

according to a pattern of several new or worn 
transmissions of a type; or (b) sources of noise 

thereof according to no predictable pattern; or (c) 
sources of noise according to calculation of 

fundamental and harmonics eg of gear tooth engagements; 
or (d) such sources denoting breakages or distortions 

in sample transmissions of a generally acceptable 
design or series.
