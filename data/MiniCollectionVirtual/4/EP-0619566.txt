<ABSTRACT>
Lotto random generator having a housing 1 and a circuit arrangement accommodated therein. The lotto random generator has an actuating opening 28, made on one side of the outer housing 1, for the actuation of a switch 15 fitted on the inner housing. The actuation of the switch causes a random generator to select at random a predetermined number of numerals from a predetermined overall set. The selected numerals are fed to a voice generator, which is integrated in the circuit arrangement and stores a number of digital voice patterns. The digital voice patterns are converted into an analog signal. The analog voice signal is amplified in an amplifier and the selected numerals are output one after the other as voice signals via a loudspeaker 26.

A lottery number random generator comprising a
housing and an electrical circuit arrangement (19)

disposed therein, the lottery number random generator
comprising an inputting device (30) disposed on the

outside of the housing and, when actuated by an
actuation signal (17), causing a random generator (32)

to select at random a predetermined number N of numbers
Z
1
...Z
N
 from a predetermined total quantity (M),
wherein all the N numbers Z
i
, i=1..N are elements of
the total quantity (M) and any Z
i
 is not equal to any
Z
j
 if i is not equal to j, where i,j=1..N,

characterised in that the circuit arrangement (19)
comprises a speech generator (34) to which there are

fed as digital signals the numbers Z
1
...Z
N
 selected by
the random gene
rator, and in that there is called up
for each number Z
i
, i=1..N the digital speech pattern
SM
i
, i=1..N stored in the speech generator and
associated with the respective number Z
i
,

in that the circuit arrangement (19) comprises a
digital-analogue converter (36) which converts the

digital speech pattern SM
i
 into an analogue signal A
i

and an amplifier (38) for amplifying the analogue
signals A
i
 i=1..N, which are delivered successively via
a loudspeaker (26).
A lottery number random generator according to
claim 1, characterised in that the random generator

(32), the speech generator (34) and the digital-analogue
converter (36) are microprocessor-controlled

(40). 
A lottery number random generator according to
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the inputting

device (30) is a switch (15).
A lottery number random generator according to
claim 3, characterised in that a time recognition

circuit (41) is disposed behind the switch (15) and can
distinguish between at least one short actuation signal

(17K) and at least one long actuation signal (17L), and
in the event of a short actuation signal (17K) selects

at random and delivers accurately one of the total N
numbers Z
i
, and in the event of a long actuation signal
(17L) selects at random in one operation all the N

numbers Z
i
 and delivers them sequentially with a
predetermined time delay.
A lottery number random generator according to any
one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the random

generator in both cases arranges all the N numbers Z
i

in ascending value before delivering them.
A lottery number random generator according to any
one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the random

generator comprises a mechanical actuation device (10)
for lip movement.
A lottery number random generator according to any
one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the random

generator comprises a read-only memory (42) in which
are stored the random selected N numbers Z
i
, a keyboard
section (46) via which N numbers Z
i
' can be input into
the random generator, and a comparator (44) which

compares the input N numbers Z
i
' with the selected N
numbers and delivers the number Ãœ of agreeing numbers 

via the speech generator (34), the D/A converter (36),
the amplifier (38) and the loudspeaker (26).
A lottery number random generator according to
claim 7, characterised in that the read-only memory

(42) and the comparator (40) are microprocessor-controlled
(40).
