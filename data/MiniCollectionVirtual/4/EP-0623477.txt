<ABSTRACT>
A process for the manufacture of a thermal 
transfer donor element having at least two areas of 

thermally transferable colorant, at least one of said 
areas being a thermal dye transfer composition and at 

least one of said areas being a thermal mass transfer 
compos
ition, which process comprises coating a first 
thermal dye or mass transferable layer containing a 

colorant onto a temporary substrate to form a primary 
thermal transfer element, said layer having a 

measurable surface area, and either 1) thermally 
transferring less than all of said layer onto a second 

temporary substrate having a non-imagewise distributed 
area of a second thermally respectively mass or dye 

transferable colorant thereon to form a thermal 
transfer donor element with at least two areas of 

different thermally transferable materials, or 2) 
splicing a portion of only one primary thermal dye or 

mass transfer element onto another thermal transfer 
element having at least a non-imagewise distributed 

second thermal mass or dye, transferable, respectively, 
colorant thereon to form a multi-color thermal transfer 

donor element having at least one area of thermal dye 
transfer donor material and at least one area of 

thermal mass transfer donor material on said element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of 
thermal transfer sheets or ribbons, particularly donor 
transfer sheets of multiple, different colors laid down 
on a carrier layer by different processes, with 
different optical properties amongst the colors, or 
with combinations of normal and exotic colors. The 
process is particularly applicable for use in proofing, 
graphic arts (for the images themselves, for local area 
images (e.g., spot images) on top of other images), or 
animated film production, where large numbers of colors 
may be needed in a wide variety of volumes. The visual quality of a graphic arts spot color 
opaque image or an animated film is readily observable 
as a function of the quality and detail of the 
individual picture frames. The individual frames in 
the film of an animated production are photographic 
images taken of individual pictures of each individual 
frame. In the art of motion picture animation these 
individual pictures are called "cels". A "cel" may 
consist of several sub-cels, each of separate image 
areas. In the highest quality cels, the background 
area (sub cel) is drawn, usually by hand, and hand 
painted overlays of the active characters are placed 
over the background areas in overlaid sub-cels and the 
composite scene photographed. The active character 
figures are progressively different (and individually 
painted that way) for each cel. This is an exceedingly 
expensive procedure when the highest quality images are 
desired.  In lower quality animated films, such as those 
often produced expressly for low budget television, 
expenses are reduced by reducing the degree of activity 
of the characters. With lower levels of activity, the 
background area can encompass greater proportions of 
the active character, with less of the character having 
to be drawn to show its movement. For example, the 
background could include the normal scenic background 
and all of the character except for its mouth. The 
only overlay for the cel would have to be the moving 
lower jaw of the character to show that it was 
speaking. Modern animated films can now use computer driven 
imaging systems to create the cels. The cells may be 
hand drawn and scanned, drawn on a digital screen and 
converted to digital data for the computer, and the 
data may be enhanced by computer programs. Various 
programs are available where the computer can create 
the data of intermediate images between two scenes by a 
process called 'morphization,' where given a beginning 
position and

A process for the manufacture of a thermal 
transfer donor element having at least two areas of 

thermally transferable colorant, at least one of said 
areas being a thermal dye transfer composition and at 

least one of said areas being a thermal mass transfer 
composition, which process comprises coating a first 

thermal dye or mass transferable layer containing a 
colorant onto a temporary substrate to form a primary 

thermal transfer element, said layer having a 
measurable surface area, and either 1) thermally 

transferring less than all of said layer onto a second 
temporary substrate having a non-imagewise distributed 

area of a second thermally respectively mass or dye 
transferable colorant thereon to form a thermal

said primary element is transferred to a second 

temporary donor substrate by thermal transfer means. 
The process of claim 2 wherein said process 
of transferring by thermal transfer means to said 

second temporary donor substrate is repeated on 
different areas of said second temporary substrate with 

different colorants to form a donor element which can 
provide more than one color during a thermal transfer process. 
The process of claim 3 where at least four 
separate areas of at least four different colors are 

deposited onto said second temporary substrate. 
The process of claim 1 wherein at least one 
color segment on said final thermal transfer donor

splice is accomplished by adhesive attachment of two 

segments.

different color segments are present on the final 

thermal transfer sheets and said two different color 
segments are formed by different coating processes 

selected from the group consisting of gravure printing, 
extrusion coating, slot coating, vapor deposition, 

sputtering, screen printing, spin coating, ink jet 
coating, and knife edge coating.

of a thermal dye transfer colorant and at least one of 

said at least two areas consists of a thermal mass 
transfer colorant.

least one colorant is in contact with a surface of said 

receptor sheet, sequentially imagewise heating said at 
least two areas of different thermally transferable 

materials with a heating element having a burn profile

different burn profile is used for at least two of said 

at least two areas of thermally transferable material.
