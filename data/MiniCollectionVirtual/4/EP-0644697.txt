<ABSTRACT>
A method for decoding an encoded image signal supplied in 
the form of a series of encoded image frames, each of the 

encoded image frames being divided into a multiplicity of 
macroblocks of pixels, each of the macroblocks having an 

associated half-pixel resolution motion vector which 
represents a translatory motion of the macroblock between a 

present and its preceding frames of the encoded image signal 
to a half-pixel accuracy, comprises: providing differential 

pixels of a differential macroblock in a first predetermined 
scanning order by performing entropy decoding, inverse 

quantization and inverse transformation on the pixels in each 
macroblock of the present frame; scanning the differential 

pixels so as to provide scan converted differential pixels of 
a scan converted differential macroblock in a second 

predetermined scanning order; providing half-pixel resolution 
pixels of a half-pixel resolution macroblock in the second 

predetermined scanning order by accessing, under a control of 
the half-pixel resolution motion vector, the pixels in the 

previous frame in an order corresponding to the second 
predetermined scanning order and, depending on the half-pixel 

resolution motion vector, performing a spatial interpolation 
on the pixels in the previous frame; and adding, on a pixel-by-pixel 

basis, the scan converted differential macroblock to 
the half-pixel resolution macroblock, to thereby form a 

reconstructed macroblock of the present frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decoding process of an
encoded image signal; and, more particularly, to a method for
carrying out half-pixel motion compensation in the decoding
process of encoded image signals according to the preamble of
claim 1.As is well known in the art, transmission of digitized
image signals can attain images of a much higher quality than
the transmission of analog signals. When an image signal
comprising a sequence of image "frames" is expressed in a
digital form, a substantial amount of data is generated for
transmission, especially in the case of a high definition
television system. Since, however, the available frequency
bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited,
in order to transmit the substantial amounts of digital data
therethrough, it is inevitable to compress or reduce the
volume of the transmission data. Among various image signal
compression techniques, the so-called hybrid coding technique,
which combines temporal and spatial compression techniques, 
together with a statistical coding technique, is known to be
most effective.Fig. 1 illustrates a hybrid coder employing the hybrid
coding technique. As shown in Fig. 1, each block of pixels
from a digitized input frame is fed to a subtracter 101. In
the subtracter 101, each block of pixels, each of which
represents the magnitude of a picture element, is
differentially combined, on an element-by-element basis, with
a predicted block of pixels from the previous frame. The block
of resultant difference data is transformed to a block of
transform coefficients using a two-dimensional transform
algorithm at a two-dimensional transformer 102, and the
coefficients in each block of transform coefficients are
quantized at a quantizer 103 and entropy coded at an entropy
coder 104 for their transmission through a transmission
channel. At the encoder 100, each block, and thereby the
entire frame, is reconstructed by inversely quantizing 105 and
transforming 106 the quantized coefficients and adding them to the
pixels of the corresponding predicted block at a summer 107.
A frame memory 108 stores the reconstructed pixels for the
next block-by-block prediction of the pixels in a next image
frame. Similarly, at a decoder 200, shown in Fig. 2,
corresponding to the encoder 100, an entropy decoder 202
decodes the entropy coded data stream and an inverse quantizer
203 and an inverse transformer 204 restore the differential
pixels for each block which are added at a summer 205 to the 
pixels of the corresponding predicted

<CLAIMS>
A method for decoding an encoded image signal supplied in
the form of a series of encoded image frames, each of the

image frames being divided into a multiplicity of macroblocks
of pixels, each of the macroblocks having an associated

half-pixel resolution motion vector which represents
a translatory motion of the macroblock between a

present and its preceding frames of the encoded image signal
to a half-pixel accuracy, and each pixel in a macroblock

being encoded (101-110) by performing an hybrid encoding
including a combination of motion-compensated inter-frame

prediction, transform coding, quantisation and
entropy encoding, said method comprising the steps of:


a) hybrid decoding (701-707) said hybrid encoded pixels
in each macroblock of a present frame for providing

differential pixels of a differential macroblock in a
first predetermined scanning order;

characterised in that said method further comprises the
following steps:


b) scanning (708) said differential pixels so as to provide
scan converted differential pixels of a scan

converted differential macroblock in a second predetermined
scanning order, where
c) the first and second predetermined scanning orders
are different from each other and contain row-wise

and column-wise scanning directions;
d) providing half-pixel resolution pixels of a half-pixel
resolution macroblock of the previous frame in

the second predetermined scanning order by accessing,
under control of the half-pixel resolution motion

vector of the macroblock in the previous frame, the
pixels in the previous frame in an order corresponding

to the second predetermined scanning order and,
under the control of said half-pixel resolution motion

vector, performing a spatial interpolation on 
the pixels in the macroblocks of said previous frame;

and
e) adding (705) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, said scan
converted differential macroblock to said half-pixel

resolution macroblock, to thereby form a reconstructed
macroblock of the present frame.
The method of claim 1, wherein each of the macroblocks is
further divided into a plurality of subblocks, and said

first predetermined scanning order uses a row-wise inter-subblock
and a row-wise intra-subblock scan, and said second

predetermined scanning order uses a row-wise inter-subblock
and a column-wise intra-subblock scan.
