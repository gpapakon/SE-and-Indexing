<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital signal
transmission method of minimizing quality deterioration in
high-speed radio data transmission where severe degradation
is caused by a multipath propagation in urban areas or
around/inside of buildings frequently.Recently, the needs of the high-speed radio data
transmission, such as a radio LAN (Local Area Network), are
increasing rapidly.The digital radio transmission in urban areas or inside
of buildings, however often has the problem of degradation in
transmission quality due to multipath fading caused by
reflections and diffractions by buildings or walls.
Particularly when the propagation delay time difference between
waves increases to such an extent that it is no longer
negligible with respect to the length of a time slot (symbol
period), the bit error rate (BER) characteristics are severely
affected by signal distortion.As a conventional method of combatting the BER 
degradation, there is a scheme in which a redundant
amplitude/phase transition is imposed on a basic modulation.The conventional digital signal transmission method will
be described below as referring to the drawings.FIG. 1 shows the phase transition of a transmission
signal according to the conventional digital signal
transmission method. The information to be transmitted is
present in a phase difference 6 between waveforms in
neighboring time slots; and a convex phase transition (t) is
redundantly imposed on each time slot. (Hitoshi Takai, "BER
Performance of Anti-Multipath Modulation Scheme PSK-VP and its
Optimum Phase-Waveform, IEEE Trans. VT, vol 42, No. 4, pp.
625-640, Nov. 1993). That is, a convex phase transition (t)
is imposed on a DPSK (Differently encoded Phase Shift Keying).
(For reference, FIG. 2 shows a differential encoding PSK
without the imposing). The transmission signal is detected by
a differential detector using a delay line with a delay of one
time slot (symbol).The improvement in BER characteristics in the presence
of a two-wave multipath having a propagation time difference
τ will be described as referring to FIGs. 3 and 4 (a wave
arriving earlier is called as a "direct wave" and a wave
arriving succeeding to the direct wave is called as a "delayed
wave").FIG. 3 shows the detected output under two-wave
multipath in DPSK. The unfiltered detected output (solid line) in FIG. 3
(c) is obtained via the vectorial sum of the direct and delayed
waves having the phase waveforms of FIG. 3 (a) and (b). The
detailed detecting method will be described below. The
