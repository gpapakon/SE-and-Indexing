<ABSTRACT>
In the packaging of cigarettes, it is necessary to check these for correct formation, especially for a complete tobacco filling. For this purpose, a checking assembly (13) is arranged within a cigarette magazine (10), with a plurality of vertical checking shafts (18), in the region of which the cigarettes are checked by optoelectrical checking members. The intact cigarettes subsequently pass in free fall into a cigarette supply (21). For cleaning the checking members, these are arranged on a movable carrier and can be moved out of a checking position into a cleaning position in which they are cleaned by brushes.

Apparatus for the testing of cigarettes in
conjunction with a packaging machine, rows of

cigarettes located above one another in a cigarette
magazine (10) being guided through a testing unit (13)

and being tested in the region of vertical test shafts
(18) of the latter by testing members in a test zone,

characterized by the following features:

a) The testing members (23, 24) work
optoelectrically,
b) The testing members (23, 24) are arranged on a
carrier (38, 39) which is mounted movably on

the cigarette magazine and which extends over
the full width of the cigarette magazine (10),
c) The carrier (38, 39), together with the testing
members (23, 24), can be moved into a testing

position and out of the latter.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the testing members (23, 24) are arranged on a

test beam (38, 39) extending transversely to the test
shafts (18) of the testing unit, and the said test

beam, together with all the testing members (23, 24),
can be moved out of the testing position and back into

the testing position.
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the test beam (38) is movable into and out of

the testing position by means of a transverse movement,
namely a to-and-fro movement transverse to the

cigarette magazine (10). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the test beams (38, 39) are displaceably

mounted at their ends on supporting members, in
particular on supporting journals (54).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 2
to 4, characterized in that the test beams (38, 39) are

of comb-like design for receiving the optoelectric
testing members (23, 24), in particular for receiving

the transmitters (23) in the region of recesses (40)
and the receivers (24) in the region of flanks (41) of

projections (42).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 2
to 5, characterized in that the test beam (38, 39) is

mounted pivotably and is movable into the testing
position and out of it by means of a pivoting movement.
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the testing members (23,

24) are movable out of the testing position into a
cleaning position, in which the testing members are

cleaned by cleaning members.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the cleaning members are designed as cleaning

brushes (46) which clean the testing members (23, 24)
by means of a cleaning movement relative to the use, in

particular by means of an upwardly and downwardly
directed cleaning movement of the cleaning brushes

(46).
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that the cleaning members, in

particular the cleaning brushes (46) movable up and
down, penetrate into the region of recesses (40) in the

testing members (23, 24) between projections (42).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1
to 9, characterized in that the testing members (23,

24) of the test beams (38, 39) are cleaned as a result
of a multiple pivoting movement of the said testing

members in relation to fixed cleaning members, in
particular cleaning brushes (57).
