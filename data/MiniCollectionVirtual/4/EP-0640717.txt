single-wire draw (12), in which the heated contact-drying 

cylinders (10) are placed in the upper row 
and the leading cylinders or rolls (11) in the lower

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a dryer section of a paper machine, comprising so-called
normal drying groups provided with single-wire draw, in which the heated contact-drying
cylinders are placed in the upper row and the leading cylinders or rolls in the
lower row, and in which dryer section there is/are a drying module or modules
between and/or inside said normal groups, in which modules the opposite side of the
web, in relation to the side placed against said contact-drying cylinders, is placed
against the heated cylinder face.The highest web speeds in paper machines are currently already of an order of 25
metres per second, but, before long, the speed range of 25...40 m/s is also likely to
be taken into use. With the current highest running speeds and with the still higher
future running speeds, especially the dryer section has become and will be the
bottleneck of the runnability of a paper machine.The quality requirements imposed on the paper produced, in particular on fine and
copying paper, are even now quite strict, and will become ever stricter. Particularly
high requirements are imposed on the symmetry of the paper in the z-direction and
on the properties of the face at both sides as well as on the stability of the paper
structure as the paper is heated rapidly in a copying or printing process. These
requirements of quality imposed on a paper product impose particularly high requirements
on the dryer section of a paper machine, which requirements are ever more
difficult to meet with increasing running speeds.As is known in prior art, twin-wire draw and/or single-wire draw is/are used in
multi-cylinder dryers of paper machines. In the former case, the groups of drying
cylinders have two wires, which press the web, one from above and the other one
from below, against the heated cylinder faces. Between the rows of cylinders, which
are usually horizontal rows, the web has free and unsupported draws, which are 
susceptible of fluttering, which may cause web breaks. This is why, in recent years,
increasing use has been made of said single-wire draw, in which, in each group of
drying cylinders, there is only one drying wire, on whose support the web runs
through the whole group so that the drying wire presses the web against the heated
cylinder faces on the drying cylinders, whereas the web remains at the side of the
outside curve on the leading cylinders between the drying cylinders. Thus, in single-wire
draw, the drying cylinders are placed outside the wire loop and the leading
cylinders inside said
