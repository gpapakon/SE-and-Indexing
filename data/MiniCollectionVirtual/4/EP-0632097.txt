<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel polyoxymethylene 
resin composition and an extrusion molded article thereof. More 
particularly, it relates to a polyoxymethylene resin composition 
having excellent moldability and an extrusion molded article 
thereof. Polyoxymethylene resins have been conventionally known as 
engineering resins having balanced mechanical properties and 
excellent moldability and have been used, in various fields, for 
parts of automobiles, parts of electric and electrical devices, 
industrial goods, toys and the like. Of these, small-sized and mass-produced articles are 
mainly produced by an injection molding method. On the other hand, 
large-sized or non-mass-produced articles are produced by an 
extrusion molding method and the resultant articles are usually 
subjected to a secondary process such as cutting. The main 
articles produced by the extrusion molding method include an 
article in the shape of a round bar having a diameter of 10 to 200 
mm (hereinafter a rod stock), an article in the shape of a sheet 
having a thickness of 10 to 100 mm (hereinafter a thick sheet) and 
the like.  
 When molded articles such as a rod stock and a thick sheet 
are produced with a polyoxymethylene resin by an extrusion molding 
method, the resultant articles are not satisfactory, that is, the 
moldability which the polyoxymethylene inherently possesses cannot 
provide desirable molded articles. Inside the resultant articles, 
a part whose color tone is different from that of the peripheral 
part (hereinafter a whitened part) or a void part comprising 
microvoids and the like occurs. These parts are unfavorable in 
view of physical properties and appearance of the molded articles. 
For example, in case of a screw prepared from a rod stock by 
cutting, its mechanical strength such as flexural strength, tensile 
strength and impact strength are reduced at a void part when the 
void part is large. As a result, the screw is easy to break. In 
order to solve such problems, improvement in reducing the 
occurrence of the void part has been awaited. There has not been any prior art trying to solve the above 
problems of whitened parts or void parts occurring in a rod stock, 
etc. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 33465/1988 
discloses a molded article in the shape of a rod stock produced 
from a resin composition which is prepared by adding ultra high 
molecular weight polyethylene to a polyoxymethylene resin. 
However, the purpose of this invention is to improve the resin 
composition
