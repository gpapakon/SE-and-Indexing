<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plaster having excellent
percutaneous absorption of piroxicam and high
anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.Piroxicam is useful as an anti-inflammatory analgesic
and has found wide-spread clinical utility as
oral preparations for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,
low back pain and cervico-omo-brachial syndrome.
It is also used as suppositories and
ointments.When administered in the form of oral preparations
or suppositories, piroxicam is however reported
to cause side effects such as stomatitis, gastric and
intestinal pain, gastric heaviness, anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and soft stool, in addition to
serious side effects such as peptic ulcer associated
with perforation, gastrointestinal problems hematemesis
and bloody stool and shock symptoms.To efficiently supply this drug to diseased area
without such side effects, it is preferred to allow the
drug to percutaneously reach such diseased area without 
taking the digestive tract. Representative examples of
preparations intended for percutaneous absorption include
ointments and plasters. As piroxicam-containing
ointments, gel-type ointments containing alcohol and
water have already been provided for clinical use. An
ointment is however accompanied by the drawbacks that
the rate of application is unavoidably inaccurate for
its inherent nature and after application, the ointment
adheres to clothing and is hence lost from
the skin.A plaster, on the other hand, is a good application
form, because it is free of such drawbacks and
also makes it possible to surely apply an intended
amount to the skin for an intended period of time.Already reported as a piroxicam-containing
plaster is a cataplasm with a base comprising 1.0-30.0
wt.% of sodium polyacrylate, 0.01-5.0 wt.% aluminum
hydroxide and 30.0-90.0 wt.% of purified water and
added with piroxicam [Japanese Patent Application
(Kokai) Laid-Open No. HEI 1-316314].This cataplasm is said to have higher effects
compared with cataplasms which are added with a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory analgesic such as indomethacin,
diclofenac, flurbiprofen or ketoprofen. However,
their percutaneous absorption have 
not been specifically clarified. It is therefore the
current circumstances that no piroxicam-containing
cataplasm has been provided yet for clinical use.There is accordingly a long-standing desire for
the provision of a piroxicam-containing anti-inflammatory
analgesic plaster which is excellent in
actual percutaneous absorption of piroxicam, has high
anti-inflammatory
