<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device 1 for receiving and holding round or cornered objects frequently encountered in the household or office, such as for example writing implements, drills or toothbrushes. The holding devices which have become known for this purpose all have the disadvantage that they are intended only for set dimensions, and thus a secure hold exists only for this one preset size. In the invention, the problem is eliminated by the fact that the clamping elements comprise clamping jaws 2, 3, of which at least one has at least one guide base which is displaceably guided in a guide 17 of the support body 4 and at least partly engages behind the support body 4. Alternatively, the possibility exists for the two clamping jaws 2, 3 to be displaceably arranged. Owing to the clamping jaws 2, 3, which are under spring pretension, the size of the object no longer matters within a preset range, since, through the clamping of the object in the clamping jaws 2, 3 which slide apart and back, on the one hand a secure hold is made possible and on the other hand the same device 1 can be used for objects of various sizes.
