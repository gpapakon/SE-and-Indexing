<ABSTRACT>
A speed detector of a scroll-type fluid machine in which 
a fixed scroll (10) and an orbiting scroll (14), each of which includes 

a spiral wrap (12,16) disposed on the inner surface of an end plate 
(11,15) thereof, are engaged with each other and housed in a closed 

housing (1), and the orbiting scroll revolves while its rotation is 
checked by means of an Oldham's ring (26) having the orbiting scroll 

disposed on the outer surface thereof, wherein the Oldham's 
ring is formed of a magnetic material, and an electromagnetic 

induction type revolution signal detecting means (50) is installed 
in an opposed relationship to the Oldham's ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speed detector of a 
scroll-type fluid machine used as a compressor, expander, etc. FIG. 4 is a longitudinal sectional view of the main part 
of a typical conventional scroll-type compressor. In this 
figure, a closed housing 1 contains a fixed scroll 10 and an 
orbiting scroll 14. The fixed scroll 10 is provided with an 
end plate 11 (not shown) and a spiral wrap 12 which is disposed 
on the inner surface of the end plate 11. The orbiting scroll 
14 is provided with an end plate 15 and a spiral wrap 16 which 
is disposed on the inner surface of the end plate 15 and has 
substantially the same shape as that of the aforementioned 
spiral wrap 12. The orbiting scroll 14 and the fixed scroll 10 
are engaged with each other at a shifted angle of 180 degrees 
in such a manner that they are eccentric to each other by a 
radius of orbital revolution as shown in the figure. This 
construction provides a plurality of compression chambers 19. At one place on the outer peripheral surface of the end 
plate 15 of the orbiting scroll 14, an iron piece 40 is fixed 
as a magnetic piece for generating revolution signals. On the  
 
peripheral wall of the closed housing 1 opposed to the iron 
piece 40, an electromagnetic induction type speed sensor 50 is 
installed as a revolution signal detecting means with a 
predetermined gap being formed between the iron piece 40 and 
the speed sensor 50. The speed sensor 50 comprises a permanent 
magnet, a magnetic core portion, and a coil wound around the 
magnetic core portion. When the iron piece 40 revolves 
following the orbiting scroll 14, the flux of the magnetic core 
portion changes, so that the same frequency as the revolution 
frequency of the iron piece 40 and an output voltage in 
proportion to the revolution frequency are produced in the coil 
according to the principle of electromagnetic induction. 
Therefore, from the value of this frequency, the number of 
revolution of the compressor can be detected. For example, 
when a difference greater than a predetermined value occurs 
between the speed of an engine etc., which is a driving source 
of the compressor, and the speed detected by the speed sensor 
50, and this phenomenon continues for some period of time, it 
can be determined that the compressor is in a locked state. In 
such a case, the power transmission between the engine and the 
compressor is cut off to prevent the cutting of belt or other 
accidents. Alternatively, various measures can be taken. With the aforementioned
