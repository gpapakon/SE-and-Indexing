<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring the deflection of the hollow axle beam of 
a vehicle in response to the loading of the vehicle comprises an 

elongated element located longitudinally with the beam and anchored 
at either end. The element is adapted to detect displacement of the 

element relative to the beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the measurement or indication 
of deflection of axles, in particular to trailer axle beams which are 
hollow. The loading of trailers as to mass distribution and total mass is not 
only a question of optimum use of the trailer but may also be 
specified by legislation. It is an object of the present invention to provide apparatus which 
gives an exact measurement of deflection of an axle, thereby giving 
an indication or direct measurement of the load and/or of its 
distribution. A European search report dated 23 August 1993 cited two patents:
 
U S 3 780 817 (Videon) relates to a load indicating apparatus for 
measuring the deflection of an axle which has a bar slung between two 
vertical supports which move towards each other when the axle 
flexes. A transducer is connected to the upper ends of the supports 
to measure the distance therebetween to give an indication of the 
load on the axle. PCT WO 90/13799 uses a string attached to spindles of an axle and 
meams are provided to measure the frequency of vibration which is  
 
related to the tension in the string. This gives a measure of the 
load on the axle. The present invention differs substantially from either of these two 
references in that the cable or rod remains straight (unlike U S 
3 780 817) and frequency is not measured but rather the degree of 
bend of the axle. According to the invention apparatus for measuring or indicating the 
deflection of a hollow axle beam in response to the loading of the 
vehicle includes an elongated element located longitudinally within 
the beam and anchored at either end thereof; and means associated 
with the element adapted to sense displacement of the element with 
respect to the beam, thereby indicating deflection of the beam. In a preferred form of the invention the elongated element is a cable 
or a rod which is clamped under tension at either end of the beam. The sensor may take any one of many forms and, in particular, a 
transducer arrangement. An embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to 
the accompanying drawings in which:  Figure 1 is a sectional side view of an axle beam incorporating the 
invention;
 
and Figure 2 is a similar view showing displacement of the elongated 
element in exaggerated condition. In the drawings an axle beam 10 is supported by springs 12 in the 
normal manner, only one spring being shown, and the wheels are 
omitted. A cable 14 is anchored at either end 16,18 of the beam 
under tension so that it assumes the

vehicle, comprising sensor means including an 
elongate element (14) for measuring the load on 

the beam, characterised in that the elongate 
element (14) is located longitudinally within the 

beam and anchored at either end (14, 18) thereof, 
and the sensor means (20) is adapted to sense the 

relative lateral displacement of the element and 
beam when the beam is under load and to provide 

an indication of the deflection of the beam 
and/or the load on the beam.
