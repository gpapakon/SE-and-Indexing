<ABSTRACT>
System for dosing a water-soluble granular or pulverulent product whose viscosity increases rapidly upon exposure to moisture, comprising a reservoir (1) for the product and a dosing device (2) from which the granular product escapes under gravity, characterised in that the dosing device (2) is placed under the reservoir (1) and occupies a volume which is distinct and smaller than the volume of said reservoir, the horizontal section of connection to the reservoir (1) of which is open to the passage of the granular product towards the dosing device (2) and has a surface area smaller than the surface area of the horizontal section of the reservoir (1), each volume being traversed by a turning shaft (4) equipped, at least in the vicinity of a lower exit channel (14, 15), with a device (5, 6, 16, 17) for guiding the granular product towards the said channel (14, 15) and for preventing agglomeration of the grains.

System for apportioning a water-soluble granular or 
powdery product whose viscosity increases rapidly with 

moistness, comprising a bin (1) for the product and an 
apportioning device (2) from which the granular product 

escapes by falling, the said apportioning device (2) being 
positioned below and occupying a volume separate from and less 

than the volume of the bin (1), with a passage between them, 
each volume having pass through it a rotating shaft (4) 

provided, at least in the vicinity of a bottom outlet channel 
(14, 15), with at least one paddle (5, 6),
 
characterised in that the surface area by which the 

apportioning device (2) is connected to the bin (1), open to 
the passage of the granular product to the apportioning device 

(2), is equal to the horizontal cross section of the latter 
and less than the surface area of the horizontal cross section 

of the bin (1), the lower volume having a vertical blade (16) 
which, via the outlet channel (15) formed in the wall of the 

apportioning device (2), enters the volume of the said 
apportioning device (2) in a direction substantially 

tangential to the movement, enabling the granular product to 
be guided towards the said outlet channel (15) and preventing 

the grains from packing together. 
Apportioning system according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the apportioning device (2) has an adjustable bottom 

outlet channel (15) opening out onto a rotating plate (7) 
provided with a means (18) for guiding the grains towards the 

periphery of the said plate (7), which also comprises a rough 
covering (23) designed to increase friction in order to 

prevent any sliding of the grains on its top surface. 
Apportioning system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the blade (16) is surmounted,  

 
along its internal path, by a tip (17) preventing the grains 

from entering the outlet channel (15) from the top. 
Apportioning system according to one of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the outlet channel (15) of the 

apportioning device (2) is adjustable by means of a flap (19) 
sliding along the outlet orifice (15) by means of a runner 

(22) formed in the said flap (19) and a screw (20) fixed to 
the body of the apportioning device (2), the holding of the 

flap (19) in a fixed position being obtained by tightening of 
this screw (20).
