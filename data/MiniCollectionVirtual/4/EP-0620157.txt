<ABSTRACT>
A paper bag, having two preferably rectangular ends (1, 2) and a tubular casing (3) arranged between them which assumes the rectangular shape of the ends (1, 2) in the filled state, can be emptied completely in daily use, the paper bag not being noticeably impaired in its stability and being easy to open if it is provided with at least one tearing strip (10) which runs in the casing (3) parallel to one end (1, 2), is formed by tearing perforations (8, 9) and extends only over a small part of the width of the casing (3).

<CLAIMS>
Multi-layer paper sack with two mainly rectangular
bottoms (1, 2) and a tube-like jacketing (3) disposed

between the latter and assuming in the filled state
the rectangular form of the bottoms (1, 2),

characterised by at least one tab (10, 10', 10'')
running parallel to a bottom (1, 2) in the jacketing

(3) and formed by tearing perforations (8, 9; 8', 9';
8'', 9'') with longitudinal lines (8', 8'') directed

respectively in the tearing direction (11) and a
frontal line (9, 9', 9'') connecting the longitudinal

lines (8, 8', 8''), which tab (10, 10', 10'') extends
over only a small part of the width of the jacketing

(3), wherein the frontal line (9', 9'') of each inner
layer is in the tearing direction (11) disposed offset

relative to the frontal line (9, 9') of the layer
located further to the outside.
Paper sack according to claim 1, characterised in that
the longitudinal lines (8, 8', 8'') running parallel

to one another of the layers are disposed offset
relative to one another.
Paper sack according to claim 2, characterised in that
the spacing of the longitudinal lines (8'', 8')

running parallel to one another of an inner layer is
smaller than the spacing of the longitudinal lines

(8', 8) of an outer layer.
Paper sack according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the tabs (10, 10', 10'') of the

layers are bonded to one another. 
Paper sack according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the tabs (10, 10', 10'') formed

by the tearing perforations (8, 9; 8' 9'; 8'', 9'')
extend across not more than half the width of a big

side wall (5) of the jacketing (3).
