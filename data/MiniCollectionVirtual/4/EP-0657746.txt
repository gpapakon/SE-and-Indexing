<ABSTRACT>
Method for compensating a magnetic interference field in a vehicle which has a navigation instrument. A first set of interference-field parameters (interference-field vector V1, axes a,b of the elliptical position curve E1, oblique position angle  delta ) is determined during a calibration journey for initial compensation from the values measured by the magnetic field probe, and these parameters are transformed into points on a circular position curve (K1) of radius a around the coordinate origin (0). During the journey, the distance from the origin (0) and the angle are calculated for each pair of measured values (MP with respective X and Y values). The calculated radius values and the circle-transformed measured-value pairs (MP) are centred in their associated memory cell in a segment memory for 360 DEG  having a multiplicity of memory cells (predetermined angle range, for example 15 DEG ). For each segment the radius difference ( DELTA a) between the averaged radius values and the radius (a) is determined and filtered; from this the maximum value (MAX) is calculated with regard to direction and amplitude and the new centre point (M2) of the position curve (K2) and thereby the new interference-field vector (V2 = V1 + V2') are calculated. The distances to the measured-value points (MP) from M2 are calculated and compared with the radius, and in the case of sufficiently accurate agreement, compensation is carried out using the new interference-field vector (V2).
