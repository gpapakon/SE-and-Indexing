<ABSTRACT>
A fire-resistant door for avoiding the through-passage of fire and smoke, in the event of a fire, from one room into the other is provided with at least one fire-resistant panel consisting of material which is resistant to fire and heat over a relatively long period of time. The fire-resistant panel (1) is retained by a door-frame structure which is made up of in each case two profiles (8, 9), between which the border of the fire-resistant panel (1) bears. Further provided is a hinge (6) which is fastened on the door-frame structure, on the door side thereof. In order to be able to produce the door-frame structure from a material in the case of which, from a visual point of view, subsequent cladding is not necessary, it is proposed that the two profiles (8, 9) consist of a material which melts away or burns under the effect of fire and heat, e.g. aluminium or wood. Since these materials are inherently not suitable as load-bearing structure in the event of a fire, in order to stabilise the fire-resistant door in the event of a fire, the hinge (6) is fastened on the door-frame structure by means of a hinge arm formed on the hinge (6). The hinge arm is connected fixedly to the two profiles (8, 9) and has a largely dimensionally stable behaviour under the effect of fire and heat. The main material considered for hinge (6) and hinge arm (19) is thus steel.

Fire-resistant door for avoiding the passage of 
fire and smoke, in the event of a fire, from one room to 

the other, having at least one fire-resistant panel (1) 
consisting of a material which resists fire and heat over 

a long period of time, and having a door-frame structure 
which retains the fire-resistant panel (1) and is made up 

of in each case two profiles (8,9) between which the 
border of the fire-resistant panel (1) rests, and having 

at least one hinge (6) which is fastened on the door side 
of the door-frame structure, it being the case that, in 

order to stabilize the fire-resistant door in the event 
of a fire, the hinge (6) is fastened on the door-frame 

structure by means of a hinge arm (19) which is formed on 
the hinge (6) and is largely dimensionally stable with 

respect to fire and heat, characterized in that the two 
profiles (8,9) consist of a material which melts or burns 

in the presence of fire and heat, for example aluminium 
or wood. 
Fire-resistant door according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the hinge (6) and the hinge arm (19) 

consist of steel. 
Fire-resistant door according to Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, characterized in that the hinge arm (19) projects 

through the abutting profile (8) and projects into 
the opposite profile (9). 
Fire-resistant door according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the hinge arm 

(19) is screwed to the two profiles (8,9). 
Fire-resistant door according to one of the  
 

preceding claims, characterized in that a further hinge 
arm (21) is formed on the frame side of the hinge (6), 

which further hinge arm is correspondingly connected to 
pairs of profiles (8,9) which form the door frame. 
Fire-resistant door according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that fastened on the 

profiles (8,9) which form the lower edge of the fire-resistant 
door are retaining parts (16,17), which are 

largely dimensionally stable with respect to fire and 
heat and at least partially overlap the lower end surface 

(18) of the fire-resistant panel (1). 
Fire-resistant door according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the two retaining parts (16,17) are 

designed as angles, of which the freely extending legs, 
which each form a rest, overlap in the region of the end 

surface (18) of the fire-resistant panel (1). 
Fire-resistant door according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the angles (16,17) are fastened, in 

particular screwed, on that flat side of the respective 
profile (8 or 9) which is located opposite the respectively 

other profile (9 or 8).
