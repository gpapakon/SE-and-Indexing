<ABSTRACT>
In a method for measuring the flow rate of a liquid, particularly of the blood, a frequency shift of a laser beam reflected in the fluid, according to the optical Doppler effect, is determined. It is intended, however, to develop this method and to propose a device for carrying out the method, in order reliably to permit spatially and temporally resolved measurement of the flow rates of the flowing medium. It is proposed that, at each sampling point, a number N of measured values are formed corresponding to the reflected light, N being an integer equal to or greater than 2, and that, from the temporal variation in the intensity of the reflected light thus measured at the corresponding sampling point, the Doppler shift is calculated and the flow rate at each point of the grid field is determined therefrom.

Method for measuring the flow rate of a fluid, in particular
of the blood, by determination of a frequency shift of a laser

beam reflected in the fluid in accordance with the optical
Doppler effect, in which two-dimensional raster scanning of an

object in lines which are in particular parallel to one another
is carried out by means of the laser beam and the Doppler shift

is calculated from the variation in time of the measured
intensity of the reflected light and is used to determine the

flow rate, the reflected light intensities of a number of M

carried out N times in succession, where N is an integer equal

to or greater than 2 and a number of N measured values are formed
