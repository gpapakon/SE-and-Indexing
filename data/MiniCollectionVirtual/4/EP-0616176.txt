<ABSTRACT>
A device for reading and transmitting control parameter 
selections to a control system for an HVAC system is 

disclosed. The device is activated by the control system 
which receives the encoded control parameter selections. 

The activation is preferably accomplished by switching a 
power supply on and off that is associated with the 

reading and transmitting device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processing of control information for use by a
control system for controlling a heating, venting and air conditioning
system.It was heretofore been known to receive control information from a control
source and thereafter process this information through for use by a control
system for a heating, venting, and air conditioning system. The control
source could be a control panel or a remote control device. The control
source may have had any number of different control parameters entered
by a user at any point in time. These entered control parameters need to
be transmitted to the control system in an efficient and expeditious
manner.The US 4,526,010 patent discloses a separation type air conditioner
including indoor, outdoor and remote controller units all of which are
provided at different locations. Each of the units is provided with a single
pair of connecting terminals to which a control device such as a
microcomputer is coupled. Data transmission between units is carried out
on a single pair of connecting terminals utilizing a high frequency
modulated signal. A DC power supply is provided in one of the indoor or
outdoor units which supplies DC power to the other units upon the single
pair of control lines. The main disadvantage of this separation type air
conditioner is that this device does not begins its reading of control
parameters selections from a beginning point in a software program
regardless of which or how many control parameters may have been
entered at any point in time. It is an object of the invention to provide a processing
system which transmits any user entered control parameters
in an efficient and expeditious fashion to the control
system of a heating, venting and air conditioning system.The above and other objects are achieved by providing a
device which reads and encodes all control parameter
selections in a predefined manner in response to the
control system. The device comprises a programmed 
microprocessor that always begins its reading of control
parameter selections from a beginning point in a software
program regardless of which or how many control parameters
may have been entered at any point in time. The
microprocessor includes a switchable power supply
associated therewith which is switched on and off
periodically by the control system that will be receiving
and responding to the control parameter selections. The
switching of the power supply on and off causes the
microprocessor to always begin at the same initial address
defining the

<CLAIMS>
A system for receiving, transmitting and processing control information
to be used for controlling a heating or air conditioning system, said

system comprising:

a programmed processor (30) for reading control information and
arranging the control information in a predefined format;
a control processor (36) for receiving the control information in the
predefined format;
a power supply (38) associated with said programmed processor
(30) for providing power to said programmed processor (30); said

power supply being switched on in response to a signal from said
control processor (36) when said control processor (36) is to

receive control information;
means for transmitting the arranged control information in the
predefined format to the control processor (36) for use in controlling the

heating or air conditioning system;
means within said control processor (36) for reading the control
information in the predefined format; and
means within said control processor (36) for switching said power
supply (38) off after reading the control information in the predefined

format.
The system of claim 1 further comprising:

means within said control system, for switching said power supply
(38) on after a predetermined period of time has elapsed following the

power supply (38) being switched off and / or
means for defining a period of time during which control information
may be read by said control system.
A system of claim 1 further comprising:

   means within said control processor (36) to check the accurate
transmission of the control information between the programmed

processor (30) and the control processor (36).
A system of claim 3 wherein the control processor (36) detect a faulty
transmission of the control information comprising:


means to switch off the power supply (38) to make a reset in the
programmed processor (30) and
means to preserve the last control information which are correct
transmitted.
