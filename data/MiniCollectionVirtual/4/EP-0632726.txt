<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method for arresting or inhibiting the growth of cells in Kaposi's Sarcoma lesions and a method for arresting or inhibiting the growth of the Kaposi's Sarcoma lesions, said methods comprising contacting the cells in the lesions with an effective amount of SP-PG, a naturally occuring sulfated polysaccharide-peptidoglycan produced by a specific species of the bacterium Arthrobacter, AT-25. The invention is also directed to blocking or inhibiting the activity of cellular vascular permeability factor(s), which comprises contacting vascular cells with an effective amount of SP-PG. In one embodiment, there is provided a method for blocking or inhibiting increased vascular permeability (and resulting edema) in diseases and disorders in which the increased vascular permeability contributes to the pathology, for example, in Kaposi's Sarcoma, tumorigenesis, inflammation, diabetic retinopathy, etc. Increased effectiveness is obtained when SP-PG is combined with cortisone or a cortisone derivative, such as hydrocortisone or tetrahydrocortisone.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD FOR TREATING KAPOSI'S SARCOMA AND BLOCKING OR INHIBITING VASCULAR PERMEABILITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to a method for arresting or inhibiting the growth of malignant or pre alignant cells in Kaposi's Sarcoma lesions. The invention is further directed to a method of blocking or inhibiting the activity of cellular vascular permeability factor or factors in vascular cells.2. Background InformationVarious forms of Kaposi•s Sarcoma are clinically recognized. These include classical [W. A. Reynolds et al. Medicine 44, 419 (1965)], African endemic [J. F. Taylor et al. Br. J. Cancer 26, 483 (1972)], immunosuppressive therapy-associated [I. Penn Transplantation 27, 8-11 (1979); D. I. Greenfield et al.. J. Rheumatol. 13, 637 (1986)], and an aggressive form of Kaposi's Sarcoma frequently observed in young HIV-1 infected homosexual men [K. B. Hymes et al. Lancet ii, 598 (1981) ; B. Safai et al. Ann. Intern. Med. 103, 744 (1985)]. Despite the clinical and epidemiological distinct forms, all are histologically similar, and exhibit microvascular proliferation (angiogenesis) in the initial stage of lesion development, which is soon followed by the presence of proliferating spindle cells, edema, and infiltration by multiple cell types [N. S. McNutt et al. Am. J. Pathol. Ill, 62 (1983)].The present inventors have previously developed in vitro systems for the long-term culture of Kaposi's Sarcoma-derived spindle shaped cells 

 using conditioned media from HTLV-I or HTLV-II infected and immortalized CD4 positive T cells or from activated peripheral blood ononuclear cells, • to facilitate cell growth [S. Nakamura et al. Science 242, 426 (1988)] and in vivo systems which simulate the formation of Kaposi's Sarcoma [S. Nakamura et aJL. Science 242, 426 (1988) ; S. Z. Salahuddin et al. Science 242, 430 (1988)]. These cells produce several lymphokines which establish the in vitro growth of these cells. They include interleukin 6 (IL-6) [S. A. Miles et __1. Proσ. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 4068 (1990)], interleukin 1 (IL- 1) , and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) [S. Nakamura et al. Science 242, 426 (1988)]. However, the most active growth factor for the Kaposi's Sarcoma spindle cells is a 30 kD protein [S. Nakamura et al. Science 242, 426 (1988)] recently purified and now under analysis. The effect of the 30 kD lymphokine is augmented by corticosteroids, but the mechanism for this interaction is unknown. In addition to these T cell-derived lymphokines, one
