<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotor-spinning device (5) with a supporting frame (14) which is fixed in a stationary manner on the stand of the spinning machine and which preferably has a supporting-flange bearing arrangement (15), an axial bearing (16) and a rotor housing (17). The rotor housing (17) can be closed via a pivotably mounted cover element (24). Arranged in the cover element (24), in addition to a channel plate (25), are a sliver draw-in roller (31), an opening roller (36) and a one-part fibre-guide channel (28). Located underneath the opening roller (36) is a dirt chamber (41) which is connected to a dirt suck-off conduit (44) via a rear connection piece (43). The position of the pivot axis (29) of the cover element (24) virtually vertically below the rotor orifice (52) results in favourable geometrical conditions during the pivoting of the channel-plate extension (26) into the rotor orifice (52), so that the mouth of the fibre-guide channel (28) can be placed near to the fibre slide wall of the rotor (20). Moreover, such an arrangement provides sufficient space for a pneumatically loadable individual dirt separator (42).

Rotor spinning device with a bearing frame (14) arranged fixed on the support 
(2) of a spinning machine (1), comprising a bearing (16) with a spinning rotor 

(20) and a rotor housing (17), and a pivot-mounted cover element (24) 
covering the rotor housing (17), which cover element comprises a sliver feed 

roller (31), a combing roller (36), a fibre guide passage (28) dipping into the 
rotor opening and a fibre drawing opening (27), whereby the cover element 

(24) is rotatably mounted about a pivot axle (29) aligned orthogonally in 
relation to the rotor axle (21), arranged roughly perpendicular beneath the 

rotor opening (52) and the cover element (24) comprises a dirt separator (42) 
with a dirt chamber (41) arranged beneath the combing roller (36), 

characterised in that the dirt chamber (41) is connected by a backward 
connection arm (43) attached to the side of the cover element (24) pointing 

towards the spinning rotor (20), to a dirt removal pipe (44) connected to a low 
pressure source (19), whereby the coupling arm (45) of the connection arm 

(43) and the dirt removal pipe (44) is positioned above the pivot axle (29). 
Rotor spinning device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
connection arm (43) and the dirt removal pipe (44) each have a flange-like 

end section (54, 55) with co-ordinated sealing means. 
Rotor spinning device according to Claim 1 and 2, characterised in that on 
using a support disc bearing (15) the bearing frame (14) accommodating 

the rotor housing (17) is secured by box walls (12) to the machine support (2) 
of the spinning machine, whereby on side arms (47) of the box walls (12) the 

cover element (24) is mounted rotatably about the pivot axle (29). 
Rotor spinning device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the pivot 
axle (29) is formed by short bolts (46), which mounted in bores on the side 

arms (47) correspond with a slotted recess (49) in securing straps (48) of the 
cover element (24).  

 
Rotor spinning device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the bolts 
(46) are secured inside the recess (49) by securing means (50). 
Rotor spinning device according to one or several of the preceding Claims 
characterised in that viewed from the front of the spinning box the pivot axle 

(29) and the drives (38, 34) for the combing roller (36) or the sliver feed roller 
(31) are arranged behind one another approximately at the same height. 
Rotor spinning device according to Claim 6, characterised in that between the 
pivot axle (29) and a drive shaft (34) arranged in parallel for the sliver feed a 

rotating tangential belt (38) is arranged which pushes a drive whorl (37) of the 
combing roller (36) from below.
