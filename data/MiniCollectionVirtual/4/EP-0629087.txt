<ABSTRACT>
A recording/reproducing apparatus, e.g. a digital video tape recorder, 
etc., is applicable to a transmission system so as sufficiently to 

utilize communication capacity. The recording/reproducing apparatus 
comprises: a recording element (e.g. a rotary head) for recording, onto 

a recording medium (e.g. a magnetic tape), digital data which has been 
time base compression processed and is delivered from the outside, e.g. 

broadcasting station side, etc.; a control circuit for carrying out 
control such as to read out the digital data from the recording medium 

at a speed lower than a recording speed in dependency upon the time 
base compression processing applied to the digital data; and an output 

circuit for outputting, as a reproduced output, digital data which has 
been read out from the recording medium. In addition to the above-mentioned 

ordinary reproduction, in the case of carrying out fast-feed 
reproduction or rewinding reproduction, the control circuit may carry 

out control such that the magnetic tape runs at a higher speed, and the 
output circuit may select and output only valid digital data of digital 

data obtained by tracing of the rotary head.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to recording/reproducing apparatus and
reproducing apparatus, for example to such apparatus suitable for use
in a digital video tape recorder equipment, etc.Nowadays, digital signal processing technology is being
remarkably developed. In broadcasting using ground wave, satellite
broadcast, cable television (CATV), telephone line and the like for
transmitting picture signals and/or audio signals, because the
transmission band is limited, there has been proposed, in order
effectively to utilize such limited transmission band, a compression
transmission broadcasting system that compresses not only picture data
and audio data but also the time base by using digital signal
processing technology to transmit picture/audio data which has
undergone data compression and time base compression in this way.A previously proposed compression transmitting apparatus for
realizing such a compression transmission broadcasting system
comprises, as shown in Fig. 6 of the accompanying drawings, an MPEG
(Moving Picture Expert Group) encoder 100, a time base compressing
circuit 101, and a frame 
forming (encoding) and modulating circuit 102.The MPEG encoder 100 adaptively carries out switching
between intraframe coding processing and interframe coding
processing for compressing the picture data to conduct coding,
and carries out motion compensating predictive coding in the
interframe coding processing.In the above example, the MPEG encoder 100 divides one
picture comprised of, e.g., one frame or one field into so called
macroblocks comprised of, e.g., 16 pixels x 16 pixels to carry
out motion compensating predictive coding in units of these
macroblocks.In more practical sense, as shown in Fig. 5, as the
processing of the first stage, motion compensating predictive
coding is successively implemented to Predictive-coded pictures
(hereinafter simply referred to as P pictures) jumping over a
predetermined number of pictures successive in point of time.As the processing of the second stage, motion compensating
predictive coding is implemented to Bidirectionally
predictive-coded pictures (hereinafter simply referred to as B
pictures) put between the P pictures or Intra-coded pictures
(hereinafter simply referred to as I pictures) by using P picture
or I picture before and after. It is to be noted that I picture
is a picture subject to intraframe coding processing, i.e., a
picture which is not subject to motion compensating predictive
coding. The MPEG encoder 100 carries out compression of picture data
