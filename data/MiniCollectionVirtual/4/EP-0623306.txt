<ABSTRACT>
Method for non-invasive detection of the concentration 
of a constituent in blood of a living animal or 

person includes the steps of irradiating a body part of the 
animal or person with intensity-modulated radiation emitted 

from the body part at wavelength ranges within the 
continuous spectrum; and using the determined intensity to 

calculate the concentration of the constituent. A radiation 
source including a radiating bulb (18) and a chopper (20) 

for periodically interrupting radiation emitted from the 
bulb may be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to techniques for non-invasively 
detecting the concentration of analytes in the blood of living animals 
or humans, and in particular to the use of continuous spectrum 
infrared spectroscopic techniques for the non-invasive detection 
of glucose concentrations in the blood of humans. In the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions, 
it is important to measure the concentration of various constituents 
in the blood. For example, in the treatment of diabetes, 
the concentration of glucose in the blood must be measured on a 
periodic basis. For persons experiencing insulin-dependent or 
Type I diabetes, it is often necessary or desirable to measure 
blood glucose concentrations several times each day. Obtaining 
accurate readings of cholesterol concentrations is important in 
the prevention of coronary artery disease. The measurement of 
the concentration of other blood analytes, such as bilirubin and 
alcohol, is also important for various diagnostic purposes. The accurate measurement of concentrations of such 
blood constituents, as it is now practiced, requires obtaining a 
blood sample, such as by pricking a finger. The obtaining of 
blood samples by invasive techniques, such as pricking the  
 
finger, is both painful and inconvenient. In the case of diabetics, 
the need to lance a finger several times a day to monitor 
glucose levels result in a buildup of scar tissue. Indeed, many 
diabetics are believed not to monitor their glucose levels as 
frequently as recommended because of the pain and inconvenience 
of the invasive method. The result of such a failure to monitor 
glucose levels is a greater risk of experiencing the long-term 
health effects of diabetes. These health effects include damage 
to the eyes, resulting in partial and often total loss of vision, 
as well as other serious health problems. Millions of individuals 
in the United States alone suffer from diabetes. As a 
result, the failure of an individual afflicted with diabetes 
reliably to monitor their glucose levels is a significant public 
health problem. In order to provide an alternative to the existing 
invasive blood glucose monitoring techniques, non-invasive blood 
glucose detection techniques have been proposed. One such 
technique is the non-invasive continuous spectrum infrared 
spectroscopic technique. One example of such a technique is 
given in U.S. Patent No. 5,070,874 (Barnes, et al.) In this 
technique, a portion of the patient's body is non-invasively 
irradiated with infrared radiation
