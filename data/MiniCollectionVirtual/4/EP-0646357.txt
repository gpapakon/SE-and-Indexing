<DESCRIPTION>
Over the past years, instruments used in surgery have 
continued to increase in complexity. Whereas instruments 
such as forceps, retractors and graspers have been used 
for some time, newer instruments such as clip appliers, 
staplers and the like are continuing to gain in 
acceptance. As more and more instruments are developed 
for surgery, they continue to become more complex. 
Examples of such complex instruments are linear staplers, 
circular staplers, ligating instruments, ligators and 
dividers. With the advent of endoscopic surgery, these 
types of instruments have become smaller in size. Many instruments have been developed to perform some 
type of surgical function, such as ligating, stapling, 
cutting or otherwise manipulating tissue. At present, 
many of these instruments are being improved to make them 
easier to use. One example of this is to make the 
business end of the instrument rotatable so that it can be 
used at various positions within the surgical. site. 
Another example is to make the distal end or business end 
of the instrument articulatable; i.e., provide angular 
motion to the business end so that it may be easily fitted 
to various configurations of the human anatomy. In the 
past, most of these complex instruments have been actuated 
or manipulated through various types of mechanical 
linkages. While these linkages have gained some 
acceptance, there are problems of size and space 
limitation accompanying such linkages, especially when 
used in endoscopic instruments. As can be appreciated, 
many of the size and space limitations may be overcome by  
 
using cables or pulleys to accomplish similar mechanical 
manipulation. Such cables require less space and are able 
to follow tortuous paths while still transmitting the 
desired forces. Also, the cable is generally a single 
piece and, hence, there are less tolerance problems. All 
of these fasteners reduce the problems encountered in the 
design of surgical instruments, especially endoscopic 
surgical instruments. While it is known that cables have certain advantages 
when used as the manipulating member in a surgical 
instrument, many of the cables still have serious 
problems. Steel cables, while providing excellent 
strength when used as a manipulating member, if used in 
any type of tortuous path where they have to pass around 
a relatively tight bend, will take a "set" which reduces 
the reliability of the instrument. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a manipulative member in a surgical instrument
