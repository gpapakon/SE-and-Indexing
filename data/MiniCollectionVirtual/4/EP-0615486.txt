<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of, and apparatus for, welding an element comprising paper to a thermoplastic material, without pre-treatment of the plastics material. In one described embodiment a laminate (12) comprising paper, with a vapour permeable, liquid impermeable coating on one major surface, was successfully welded to a polypropylene material (15) some 1.5 mm thick, the uncoated surface of the laminate forming the interface with the polypropylene, by subjecting the interface to conditions between two ranges of parameters, a temperature of 185  DEG C and a pressure of 460 kPa for a period of 10 seconds and a temperature of 220  DEG C and a pressure of 460 kPa for a period of 5 seconds. All the welds effected between said ranges of parameters produced an acceptable weld of the paper to the thermoplastics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to welding and, more
specifically, to the fabrication of articles by welding
processes.It is well known in the art to fabricate an article by
welding together two or are elements, particularly when said
elements are of the same or similar materials, but problems do
exist when the elements are of different materials and wherein
the temperature and/or pressure required to bring one of the
said elements into a condition for welding may adversely affect
the other element. This problem is compounded when three or
more elements of different materials are to be welded together
by a single welding process.By way of example, problems do arise in the welding of
paper to the higher melting temperature thermoplastics
materials and wherein the temperature required for welding the
thermoplastics material approaches the combustion temperature
for the paper. In this specification the term " high melting
temperature thermoplastics materials" is intended to mean
thermoplastics materials having a melting temperature of at 
least 130 degrees C.The problems of heat sealing or welding an olefinic
polymer to a surface consisting of a polar synthetic or
cellulose material are recognised in, for example, British
Patent Publication No 2053794-A and in that publication it is
claimed that the problem can be solved by subjecting the
olefinic plastics to a corona treatment before the welding of
the polymer to the polar synthetic or cellulose material is
effected.The applicant has discovered that a thermoplastics
material can be welded to a cellulose material without first
subjecting the plastics material to a corona treatment and,
accordingly, all welding processes as require a corona
treatment before the welding is affected are disclaimed
herefrom.It is well known in the art to fabricate devices for
dispensing vapours of volatile liquids and wherein the liquid
is retained in a container open at one side and the said open
side is closed by a vapour-permeable, liquid-impermeable
membrane. One form of vapour-permeable, liquid-impermeable
vapour membrane which offers particular advantages in this art
comprises a sheet of paper coated or impregnated, hereinafter
called coated, with a material to render the laminate membrane
liquid-impermeable but vapour-permeable when the coated surface
of the laminate is exposed to atmosphere. One such device is
disclosed in British Patent Publication No. 2194889.The container for such a device must essentially be
inert with respect to the volatile liquid to be

<CLAIMS>
A method for welding an element, comprising a
paper sheet having a coating of a vapour-permeable

liquid-impermeable material, to a thermoplastics
material so that the coating is remote from the

thermoplastic material and wherein the thermoplastics
material has not been subjected to a Corona treatment,

which method comprises the steps of applying the
element to a surface of the thermoplastics material,

applying a pressure in the range of 150 kPa to 2000 kPa
to the interface of the element with the thermoplastics

material, and subjecting the said pressure-loaded
plastics material and element to an elevated

temperature in the range of from 140 degrees C. to 300
degrees C.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
interface between the element and the thermoplastics

material is subjected to a temperature of from 160
degrees C. to 240 degrees C.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
interface between the element and the thermoplastics

material is subjected to a temperature of from 175
degrees C. to 220 degrees C.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein a
pressure of from 150 kPa to 500 kPa is applied to the

interface.
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein a pressure
of from 200 kPa to 450 kPa is applied to the interface.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2, 3,
4 or 5, wherein the interface between the element and 

the thermoplastics material is maintained at said
elevated temperature and pressure for a period of from

0.5 seconds to 20 seconds.
A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
interface between the element and the thermoplastics

material is maintained at said elevated temperature and
pressure for a period of from 5 seconds to 15 seconds.

softening point below 280 degrees C. and a melt-flow
index of from 4 to 100.
A method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
thermoplastics material has a softening point below 220

degrees C. and a melt-flow index of from 4 to 100.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9
