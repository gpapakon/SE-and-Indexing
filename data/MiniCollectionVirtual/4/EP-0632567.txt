<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the automatic forming of packs of trimmed 
metal sheets for armatures of electrical machinery or the 

like, the pack (P') is formed by the controlled drop of a 
sheet stack (P) housed in a tubular magazine (1) open at the 

bottom, against an underlying collection bottom (2) which is 
brought to a predefined distance from the lower end of the 

magazine (1). A tightening clamp (3,4) at the lower end of 
the magazine (1) blocks the stack (P) against a further 

gravity drop after its descent against the collection bottom 
(2). A subsequent first lowering of the bottom (2) to 

separate the pack (P') from the overlying stack, by virtue of 
detachment means (22, 122), is followed by a detachment from 

the lower sheet (L') of the stack (P) of a possible sheet (L) 
which is mistakenly and temporarily held against said lower 

sheet (L') of the stack (P) but belongs to the overlying pack 
(P'). This invention also relates to a device for the 

accomplishment of this method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for automatic forming 
of packs of trimmed metal sheets for the manufacture of 
armatures of electrical machinery or the like, through 
automatic precision proportioning of the sheet pack 
consisting of the collection and separation of a predefined 
number of sheets, corresponding to a predefined height of 
the pack itself, from a sheet stack, 
said method being carried out by means of a 
device which is 
provided with a vertical magazine for a sheet stack which is open 
at the bottom and the lower end of which is associated with 
a raisable and lowerable bottom for the collection of the 
sheet pack, according to the preamble of claim 1. This method is used for the manufacture of metal 
armatures, for instance, of stators and rotors for electric 
motors, trasformers, remote control switches etc. and is 
known from prior use in machines manufactured by the 
Applicant. The proportioning of the sheet pack to be separated from 
the sheet stack is made difficult by the fact that, for a  
 
predefined height of the sheet pack, no-one knows the number 
of sheets comprising it and thus no-one can determine the 
division line between the last upper sheet of the pack to 
separate and the lower sheet of the stack which constitutes 
the first lower sheet of the subsequent pack. This is due to 
the tolerances in the thickness of the plate from which 
individual sheets are trimmed. Owing to the tolerances of 
these plates, when the pack is separated from the overlying 
stack of sheets, the last upper sheet still belonging to the 
separated pack can still be held temporarily at the lower end 
of the overlying stack of sheets by means intended to block 
it in the magazine, being, for instance, engaged by said 
means only for a small portion of its thickness. Therefore, 
in these conditions, the separated sheet pack is missing a 
sheet and thus undersized. Furthermore, the last sheet 
belonging to the separated pack and precariously held against 
the overlying stack can detach itself from the stack at any 
time and, falling in an uncontrolled manner, can damage and 
jam the device. The last sheet of the separated pack can be precariously 
held against the stack itself, because of a moderate sticking 
or adhesion effect due, for instance, to the presence of 
trimming lubricants, oxides, material annealing, or other 
similar causes. Therefore, the purpose of the invention is to enhance a 
method and device for forming packs of sheets of the type  
 
described above which, by relatively

trimmed sheets for the manufacture of armatures of electrical 

machinery or the like, through automatic precision 
proportioning of the sheet pack (P'), consisting of

for forming the sheet pack (P'): 


Shifting the collection bottom (2) in a raised 
position at a predefined distance from the lower sheet (L') 

of the vertical sheet stack (P), which is held against a 
gravity fall towards the collection bottom (2) by at least 

one clamp (3, 4) acting together with the peripheral edges of 
one or more lower sheets of said stack (P), this distance 

corresponding to a predefined height of the sheet pack (P') 
to collect, or to a certain number of sheets of the stack 

(P); 
Opening the clamp (3, 4) and gravity sliding towards 
the collection bottom (2) of the sheet stack (P), to an 

extent corresponding to the predefined height of the sheet  
 

pack (P'); 
Separation of the sheet pack (P') from the overlyi.ng 
sheet stack (P) through re-closure of the clamp (3, 4) and a 

first lowering of the collection bottom (2) through 
detachment of the sheet pack (P') from the overlying stack 

(P); 
Detachment of any last sheet (L) of the separated pack 
(P') which erroneously remained held by part of its 

thickness by the clamp (3, 4) and remained moderately stuck 
to the lower sheet (L') of the sheet stack (P) intended to 

become the first lower sheet of a subsequent pack and which 
thus extends at the bottom, at least in part beyond the 

lower edge of the clamp (3, 4), by virtue of a detachment 
finger (22) which is brought into action after the 

separation step and the first lowering of the collection 
bottom (2), in the sense that said detachment 
finger (22) is 
moved, from its readiness position, radially toward the axis 

of the sheet stack (P) where it strikes a protruding edge of 
a sheet (L') which is erroneously remained stuck to the 

sheet pack (P), and subsequently said detachment finger (22) 
is subjected to a second vertical lowering, causing the 

detachment and fall on the sheet pack (P') of the last sheet 
erroneously held by the clamps (3, 4). 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that
