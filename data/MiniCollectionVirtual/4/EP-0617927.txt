<ABSTRACT>
A surgical device for percutaneous connection of a fractured 
upper part of the femur to the shaft comprises: a connector 

plate (I) with a lower straight portion for screwed 
connection to the femur shaft and with a sharp bottom end 

(8) for insertion through a small skin incision, having its 
upper portion perforated by two oblique, tapped bores (5) 

for fixation of two long screws (II) serving for connection 
of the fractured parts. Each screw has a wood-screw-shaped 

inner end (11) and a cylindrical shaft (10) with a hexagonal 
recess (12) at its outer end which is continued by a tapped 

bore (13). Each screw is slidingly positioned in a sleeve 
(III) which has its outer end slotted and screw-threaded 

(16,15) for fixation in the oblique bores of the plate. The 
connector plate is positioned and fastened to the femur by 

an angular connector arm (IV) composed of a short horizontal 
arm (20) for firm perpendicular connection to the top of the 

plate (I) by a long screw (22), and a vertical portion (21) 
parallel to the plate provided with bores (26) coaxial with 

the bores (5) in the plate for guidance of the screws by 
means of a set of tubular guides.A screwdriver (V) contains 

a central shaft (40) having a screw-threaded inner end (41) 
for engagement with the tapped bores in the screw ends, an 

intermediate tubular shaft (43) having its inner end (44) 
hexagonally shaped for engagement with the recesses (12) in 

the screw ends, and an outer tubular shaft (47) provided 

with teeth (48) for engagement with the slots (16) in the 
sleeve ends. All three shafts can be independently rotated 

and axially moved by separate grips (42,45,49) at the outer 
end of the screwdriver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is an improvement of the surgical
device disclosed in my U.S. Patent No. 4,465,065. It
serves for connection of the fractured neck to the shaft
of a femur by means of a pre-drilled connector plate,
without the requirement of making a large incision in the
overlying skin and tissue.The connector plate according to the above patent and
according to the present invention has a sharp lower edge
by which it penetrates through a small incision in the
trochanter region into close contact with the shaft.
During the operation the plate is temporarily attached to
the horizontal portion of a connector arm, while its
vertical portion extends parallel to the plate and is
provided with holes which are coaxial with the holes in
the plate. Concentric guide tubes are inserted through
the holes in the vertical portion of the connector arm,
are pushed through the soft tissue up to the plate and
serve as guides for pre-drilling of the bone parts in the
correct position as viewed by X-ray equipment. After pre-drilling
the inner guide tubes are removed and the outer
tubes serve for insertion of long screws, and are afterwards
removed. The long screws are tightened so as to
contract the fractured parts. Short screws serving for
firm attachment of the plate to the femur shaft are now
inserted through the vertical portion of the connector
arm, after suitable drilling through tubes inserted into
hcles in the arm, which are co-axial with the holes in the
plate. The connector arm is now detached from the plate,
and the wound is closed. 
The present device is similar and serves the same purpose,
but is designed to avoid certain drawbacks of the original
device which have come to light during its use in
operations of the kind referred to. The following main
drawbacks were observed:The long screws did not permit active compression of the
fractured bone parts, a task which is most important for
quick healing of the bone and for early use of the limb by
the patient.The long screws were not sufficiently guided in the
holes of the connector plate and were apt to wobble, often
resulting in instability of the fracture after
connection.The screws were apt to protrude out of the bone into the
soft tissue, after walking of the patient had started and
the fracture had been pressed.The connector plate was not firmly fastened to the femur
during operation, which made drilling difficult.The device according to the present invention aims to
obviate these drawbacks by providing improved components
which facilitate and shorten
