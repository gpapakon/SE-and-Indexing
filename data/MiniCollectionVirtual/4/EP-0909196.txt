<ABSTRACT>
Compound steering assemblies (28), usable in both diagnostic and therapeutic applications, enable a physician to swiftly and accurately steer the distal section (16) of the catheter (10) in multiple planes or complex curves to position and maintain ablation and/or mapping electrodes (18) in intimate contact with an interior body surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a steerable catheter according to the preamble of claim 1.Accordingly, the invention generally relates to catheters that
can by steered by external controls, and
particularly to such catheters
that can assume complex three dimensional curves.
In addition, the invention describes the use of
such complex curves to ablate arrhythmia substrates
in body tissue.Cardiac mapping is used to locate aberrant
electrical pathways and currents emanating within
the heart. Such aberrant pathways cause irregular
contractions of the heart muscle resulting in life-threatening
patterns or disrhythmias.Ablation of cardiac tissue to create long
curvilinear lesions within the heart is also desired
for treatment of various disorders such as atrial
fibrillation. Various steering mechanisms for
catheters carrying such electrodes have heretofore
been developed and used.To access various endocardial sites,
physicians have used a number of different catheters
and techniques, each of which provides a different
characteristic. The use of catheters having limited
steering characteristics increases the risk inherent
in any catheterization procedure and limits the
accessibility of many potential ablation sites.Site access using standard distal tip 
steerable catheters is less of a problem because
those catheters position a single electrode into
contact with the endocardium and a specific
electrode orientation is not required. Problems of
endocardial site access are accentuated when trying
to simultaneously position multiple electrodes into
intimate tissue contact. In this scenario, standard
steerable catheter configurations orient multiple
electrodes in planes emanating about the axis of the
introduction vessel.A need has thus existed for catheters
which, in the nonlinear environment found within the
heart as well as other body cavities, are capable of
being steered to place ablation elements at a number
of locations while creating intimate tissue contact
throughout the length of all active ablation
elements.Particularly, a need has existed for a
catheter which could effectively and accurately form
curves in more than one plane for better access or
tissue contact. Previous attempts to provide such
devices are represented by U. S. Patent 5,383,852
wherein there was suggested the use of steering wire
extending from a central lumen of a catheter
radially outward to the periphery of a distal end
component. Another suggestion in represented by
U.S. Patent No. 5,358,479 wherein a single pull
cable is attached to the
