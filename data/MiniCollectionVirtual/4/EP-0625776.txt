<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus 
capable of recording video, audio and other information 

on a magnetic tape by, for example, the helical 
scanning method. A rotary head is rotated at an m-fold 

speed to record intermittent tracks on the magnetic 
tape so that real-time simultaneous monitoring 

is performed. By high-speed dubbing due to high-density 
intermittent recording and by increasing the 

number of repetition of track scanning, the information 
is recorded and reproduced simultaneously with a 

plurality of channels. Any tracking error is detected 
to form a co
ntinuous and uniform track pattern. With 
this intermittent comb-shaped recording, reciprocating 

recording and reproducing can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording 
and reproducing apparatus for recording video and 
audio information on a magnetic tape in a helically 
scanning system. FIG. 4 shows another prior art magnetic recording 
and reproducing apparatus disclosed in, for example, 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 
133573/1985. In FIG. 4, 101-1 and 101-2 designate a 
pair of magnetic heads, and 102 designates a rotary  
 
drum. The magnetic heads 101-1, 101-2 are mounted on 
the peripheral edge of the rotary drum 102 and are 
angularly spaced from each other by 180Â°. 110 designates a magnetic tape, and 114 designates 
a mechanism control circuit. The mechanism control 
circuit 114 controls the number of rotations of 
the rotary drum 102 and the feeding of the magnetic 
tape 110. A low-pass filter (hereinafter called "LPF") 
makes a band restriction for sampling the inputted 
recording video signal. An A/D converter 151 samples 
the band-restricted recording video signal. An encoder 
152 encodes digitized recording video data so 
that an error which occurred when the data are magnetically 
recorded and reproduced can be corrected. A 
modulator 153 encodes the encoded recording video data 
so as to be optimum data suitable for magnetic recording 
and reproducing. A head amplifier 142 amplifies 
the recording video data signal during recording and 
drives the magnetic heads 101-1, 101-2. A reproducing head amplifier 143 amplifies the 
reproducing signal reproduced by the magnetic heads 1-1, 
1-2 during reproducing. A demodulator 154 decodes 
the reproducing signal in the manner reverse to the 
encoding in the modulator 153. A decoder 155 corrects 
and detects any error in the decoded data. A D/A converter  
 
156 analogizes reproducing video data whose error 
has been corrected by tee decoder 155. An LPF 157 
restricts the reproducing video signal to a video signal 
band and outputs the restricted signal. A self-recording-and-reproducing/dubbing change-over 
switch (hereinafter called "change-over switch") 
158 is disposed between the encoder 152 and the modulator 
153. The change-over switch 158 makes a change-over 
between the self-recording-and-reproducing mode and 
the dubbing mode and is controlled by a change-over 
signal. By this change-over action of the change-over 
switch 158, the dubbing input signal or the output of 
the encoder 152 is inputted to the modulator 153. In 
the meantime, the output of the demodulator 155 is 
supplied to the D/A converter 156 and is outputted 
to the exterior as a
