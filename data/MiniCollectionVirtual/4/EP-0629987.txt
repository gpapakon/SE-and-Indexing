<ABSTRACT>
An interactive book or device (100) having a mechanism for 
generating a plurality of sensory outputs in a manner that 

maximizes the interaction between the user and the book or device. 
The interactive book includes function initiators (106) for initiating 

a unique sensory output that corresponds to a visual indicia (114) 
on a page of the book (104). A function level selector (108) is 

coupled to the function initiators (106) that selectively changes a 
function level and thereby selectively changes the sensory output 

corresponding to each function initiator (106). Consequently, the 
number of sensory outputs is increased and thereby enables greater 

interaction between the user and the book. It also encourages the 
user to creatively combine the sensory outputs to obtain a 

cognizable aggregate output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to interactive
books and devices and, more particularly, to
interactive books and devices in which sensory outputs
are provided for each page of the book or layout of
the device.A book can be more fun as an amusement device and
more effective as an educational tool when it has
features that not only engage the attention of the
user but also encourage the creativity of the user.
Books with various interactive features have been
proposed in the past. One such book is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,884,974 to DeSmet. This patent
discloses a book usable with an audio player assembly
that provides audio outputs relevant to material on
the printed page in response to actuation of any of a
series of buttons. One button provides an audible
reading of the text on the page of the book. Another
button provides an audible question pertaining to the
information given in the written text. The remaining
two buttons provide choices of answers to the
question.Another example of an interactive book is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,990,092 to Cummings.
This patent discloses a book having a series of
buttons mounted along the outer edge of the bottom
cover. Each button is programmed to provide an audio
output relevant to a corresponding page of the book.Yet another example interactive book is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,997,374 to Simone. This patent
discloses a book device having an audio program source
that provides audio outputs either of the text on a
particular page of the book or a question pertaining 
to that text. A user answers any question by
actuating any of a plurality of answer buttons.Other interactive books have been proposed as
well. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,636,881 to
Brefka et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,809,246 to Jeng, U.S.
Patent No. 5,167,508 to McTaggart and PCT Publication
No. WO 91/06090 (Billings et al).WO-A-90/15402 discloses a toy or educational
device having a housing with an upper surface on which
a book or sheet of paper may rest. Underneath the
surface a number of proximity sensors are provided.
The upper surfaces provided with electrical or optical
sensors adapted to identify codes formed on the rear
face of the book or sheet of paper. The sheet of
paper is located on the upper surface of the housing
and a loud speaker gives preliminary instructions to
the user. When a finger is placed upon a certain part
of the picture, the machine then responds with further
comments.These known interactive books, however, do not
provide a mechanism that maximizes

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus comprising:

means (103) for storing a set of discrete
sensory outputs;
means (110) for outputting each of each
sensory outputs;
a plurality of pages (104) each including a
plurality of visual indicia;
a plurality of function initiators (106)
coupled to said output means, each of said function

initiators initiating the output of a unique sensory
output by said output means,
function level selector means (108) coupled
to each of said function initiators for selecting from

a number of function levels of the apparatus to change
the sensory output of said function initiators, each

of said function initiators being associated with a
different sensory output at each of said function

levels and each of said function levels corresponding
to a respective one of said pages; and
a support member (102) supporting said
storage means, said output means, said plurality of

function initiators, said function change selector
means and said pages;

   characterised in that the function level
selector means are manually operable, an indicator is

provided for displaying the selected function level,
and in that each of said function initiators

corresponds to at least one of said visual indicia on
a page, all of the function initiators being

physically distinct from all of said visual indicia.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterised in that said words of said sensory

outputs are at each of said levels, in multiple orders
to form a plurality of phrases or sentences.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim
2, characterised in that said function initiators

(106) are grouped into a plurality of pairs of
initiators, one of said initiators in each of said

pairs initiating the output of a word or phrase by
said output means in a first language, and the other

of said initiators in each of said pair initiating the
output of the same word or phrase by said output means

in a second language.
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1
to 3, characterised in that said page contains a

plurality of questions, each of said visual indicia
representing an answer corresponding to one of said

questions and each of said sensory outputs indicating
whether said visual indicia is a correct or an

incorrect answer to said corresponding question.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4, further
comprising:


a timer circuit for specifying a counting of
a specific period of time; and
a scoring circuit for counting the number of
function initiators which correspond to said visual

indicia which is a correct answer, initiated during
said specific period of time.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3,

characterised in that a sensory output indicating a
correct response is associated with said function

initiators corresponding to visual indicia which
indicate a correct response to said corresponding

question, and a sensory output indicating an incorrect 
response is associated with said function initiators

corresponding to visual indicia which indicate the
incorrect response to said corresponding question.

set of said sensory outputs, said ordered set being

comprised of the sensory outputs associated with a set
of selected function initiators on a selected one of

said levels and being ordered in the order in which
