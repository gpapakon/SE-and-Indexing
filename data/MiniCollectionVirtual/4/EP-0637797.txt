<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for calculating the square root of the
sum of the square of the value represented by a first digital signal and the square of
the value represented by a second digital signal.In digital signal processing, some calculations are intended to derive the
square root So of the sum of the square of a first value represented by a first digital
signal and the square of a second value represented by a second digital signal.
Specifically, the square root So is expressed as
So=A2+B2
where "A" denotes the
value represented by the first digital signal and "B" denotes the value represented
by the second digital signal.As will be described later, prior-art apparatus for such calculations tend to
be complicated in structure.An apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in the paper
by Braun et al in Electronics letters Vol.10 No. 13 of 27th June 1974 Enage GB
pages 255 to 256.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved calculation apparatus.This invention provides a calculation apparatus comprising: 
first means for processing a first digital signal of a serial form into a
second digital signal of a serial form, the second digital signal
representing an absolute value |A| of a value A represented by the first
digital signal;second means for processing a third digital signal of a serial form
into a fourth digital signal of a serial form, the fourth digital signal
representing an absolute value |B| of a value B represented by the third
digital signal;third means for comparing the values A and B represented by the
first and third signals, and generating a comparison-result digital signal
representing a result of said comparing; andfourth means for calculating a result value RV in response to the
absolute value |A| represented by the second digital signal, the absolute
value |B| represented by the fourth digital signal, and the comparison
result by the comparison-result digital signal characterised in that the
fourth means calculates the result value RV according to an equation
expressed as follows:
RV=(MAX (|A|, |B|)+MIN(|A|, |B|)x(√2-1)27
where MAX denotes an operator for selecting the greatest of the absolute
values |A| and |B|, and MIN denotes an operator for selecting the 
smallest of the absolute values |A| and |B|, the result value RV being
approximate to 27 times the square root of the sum of the square of the
value represented by the first digital signal and the square of the value
represented by the third digital signal, the fourth means
