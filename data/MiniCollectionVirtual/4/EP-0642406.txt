<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the incorporation of carbon black, usually
together with other fillers, in a polymeric material such as natural and
synthetic rubber as part of the procedure of compounding.As has been known for many years, natural or synthetic rubber must be
subjected to intensive working to make it softer and more pliable prior to
vulcanisation. It has also been known for many years that to improve its
characteristics, especially its tensile strength, and make it suitable for
the manufacture of articles such as pneumatic tyres, fillers must be
incorporated and dispersed in the mix, the principal filler in terms of the
proportion by weight utilised and the most important in terms of its effect
on the characteristics of the compound being carbon black.As manufactured particulate carbon black takes the form of groups of
fused particles known as "primary aggregate". The groups are also more
loosely interconnected in chains referred to as the "structure" of the
filler. Successful incorporation requires that as high a proportion as
possible of the voids existing between the particles of a group become
filled with polymer and successful blending requires that the chains are at
least to some extent broken up so as to achieve as even a dispersion as
possible of the groups, or broken chains, within the body of polymer. At
the same time the treatment should not be such as to destroy a high
proportion of the groupings of particles, because the fusion or welds
between these are believed to provide the necessary reinforcement of the
compound.Hitherto the processes of filler incorporation, blending and
homogenising, and mixing or masticating have been carried out simultaneously
by subjecting the heterogeneous mixture of polymer particles, carbon black
and any other desired fillers to intensive working e.g. by passing it
between opposed, counter-rotating rollers of a mill or by forcing it through
specially shaped screws. The intensive working of the mixture generates
considerable heat - typically in excess of 170 degrees centigrade -
sufficient to plasticise the polymer. The perceived solution to poor 
incorporation or dispersion is to repeat the mixing process, the same batch
of mixture being subjected repeatedly to intensive working, or to extend the
mixing screw so that the mixture is subjected to a lengthier mixing
procedure. This or course leads to high energy consumption.The present invention proceeds from the realisation that to plasticise
the polymer is counter-productive to the aims of filler

<CLAIMS>
A method for the incorporation of a primary aggregate of carbon black
into a a polymeric material 
characterised in that
 it comprises subjecting a
loose, previously unworked admixture of the carbon black and pellets of the

polymer to a shearing and smearing action between relatively moving hammer
(34) and anvil (32) components such that the carbon black is incorporated

into the polymer under conditions controlled so that the polymer remains
throughout the incorporation procedure substantially below its plasticising

temperature.
A method as claimed in claim 1 
characterised by
 producing a flow of
the lightly compressed admixture past an anvil surface (42) which is oblique

to the direction of the flow and relatively moving a blunt hammer tool (34)
transversely to the direction of the flow in proximity to the anvil surface

(42) such that the admixture is smeared between the hammer tool (34) and
the anvil surface (42).
A method as claimed in either preceding claim 
characterised by

producing a flow of the admixture along a screw transporter (10,10A) and
smearing the admixture between end faces of a milling tool (32) rotating

faces in a circumferentially spaced array (33) around the screw shaft (25).
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
characterised in that
 it
comprises the further step of subjecting the smeared mixture to a second,

plasticising temperature. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 
characterised in that
 it comprises

the anvil surface (42) such that the incorporated mixture is smeared between
the hammer tool (34) and the anvil surface (42).

unincorporated admixture.
