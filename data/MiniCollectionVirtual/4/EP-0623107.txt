<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement in a process for the preparation of 
optically active carboxylic acids and the esters thereof. More particularly this invention 
relates to an improved process for the preparation of aliphatic carboxylic acids and 
the esters thereof by adding to a mixture of the diastereomeric salts of such materials 
a solution of the aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof for a time sufficient to cause 
the crystalline material to increase in the concentration of one of the salts and then 
separating the diastereomeric salt. Resolution of racemic aryl-substituted aliphatic carboxylic acids has been 
described in the literature. Kaiser et al., J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 65, No. 2, 269-273 
(February 1976) formed the S(-)-α-methylbenzylamine salt of S(+)-ibuprofen, removed 
it from the reaction mixture by filtration, and recrystallized it from isopropanol and 
then from methanol. After acidifying the 3N aqueous sulfuric acid and extracting with 
ether, S(+)-ibuprofen was obtained, m.p. 50-52°, [α]D +57·, with 95% optical purity 
as determined by GLC analysis. Cox et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., Vol. 232, No. 
3, 636-643 (March 1985), using the Kaiser et al. method, were able to obtain an S(+)-ibuprofen 
preparation which was 99% S isomer and 1% R isomer (w/w). Other methods of separating the enantiomers of racemates can be effected by 
preparing a salt of the acid with an alkaloid or similar resolving agent such as 
cinchonidine, then separating the products by fractional crystallization from a solvent 
in which the salt of the dextrorotatory isomer is less soluble. The (+)-salt can then 
be acid cleaved to yield pure enantiomer. See, for example, U. S. Patent No. 4,209,638 
issued June 24, 1980, and U. S. Patent No. 3,637,767 issued January 25, 1972, which 
relate to resolution of naproxen and related compounds. U. S. Patent No. 5,015,764 discloses and claims a process for increasing the 
amount of the desired enantiomer obtained from a racemic mixture of C1 to C6 linear 
or branched aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof. The process comprises: (i) 
forming a mixture comprising the racemic mixture of the C1 to C6 linear or branched  
 
aliphatic carboxylic acid or ester thereof and an organic or inorganic solvent; (ii) 
treating said salt solution with a chiral organic nitrogenous base; (iii) precipitating from 
the reaction solution produced in the treatment of step (ii) a crystalline material that 
is comprised of greater than 50% of one diastereomeric salt; and (iv)
