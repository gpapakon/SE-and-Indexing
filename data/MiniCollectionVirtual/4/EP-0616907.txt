<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus (1) for stripping wall coverings by means of steam, consisting of a steam generator (2) and a steam plate (3) connected thereto via a steam hose (4), the steam generator (2) having a kettle (11) which can be closed by a lid (21) provided with a carry handle (31) and an electrical heating element (16), the carry handle (31) provided on the lid (21) is fixed to the lid (21) and thermally insulated therefrom. As a result of this design, a user of the apparatus (1) cannot come into contact with heated components or steam if the apparatus is used as intended. Burns and scalds are thus reliably avoided, and a high degree of operational safety is achieved.
