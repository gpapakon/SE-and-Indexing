<ABSTRACT>
A separation-science medium support plate (
10
) has an upstream side 
(
11
) that has a multiplicity of concentric, radially-spaced grooves (
12
) located 
thereon. The concentric, radially-spaced grooves (
12
) each have two open 
ends (
14, 16
) that allow a groove (
12
) to communicate, ultimately, with a 
radially-extending groove (
18
) that has an opening (
22
) located therein. The 
opening (
22
) is disposed in the radially-extending groove (
18
) towards the 
periphery of the support plate (
10
) and allows a fluid to pass from the 
upstream side (
11
) of plate (
10
) to the downstream side (
24
). Plate (
10
) lacks 
any openings for fluid passage other than the peripherally-located openings 

(
22
). A plate (
10
) of this invention allows a fluid passing through a 
separation-science membrane (
44
), resting upon plate (
10
), to uniformly wet 
the membrane (
44
).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a plate which supports a separation science 
medium and allows for the even distribution of flow of a fluid through the 
medium. In the separation-science art, support plates are known which are used 
for distributing a fluid uniformly over a separation-science medium. 
Examples of such known support plates are disclosed in the following United 
States Patents: 5,100,551; 4,944,876; 4,902,420; and 3,209,915. U.S. Patent 
4,944,876, in particular, discloses a support plate that has a recessed channel 
network for uniformly distributing a fluid across a membrane filter. The 
recessed channel network includes concentrically arranged circular channels 
and a plurality of radially extending channels that intersect with the circular 
channels and communicate with an outlet passage. The outlet passage is 
centrally located in the recessed channel network, and in this position does not 
allow a fluid that is deposited centrally on the membrane filter to become 
distributed over the peripheral portions of the filter. This can be problematic 
when the fluid inlet is also centrally located and the filter needs to be fully 
wetted. The present invention provides a plate for supporting a separation 
science medium in such a manner that a fluid deposited centrally on the 
separation-science medium can become evenly distributed over the whole 
surface of the medium. The support plate is particularly effective for use in 
an apparatus which has a centrally located fluid inlet port. Briefly, the 
separation-science medium support plate of this invention comprises:
 
   a plate having a first and second opposite sides, the first side having 
a plurality of concentric radially-spaced grooves located thereon, the 
concentric radially-spaced grooves having first and second open ends which 
allow the concentric radially-spaced grooves to communicate with a groove 
(A) directly or via a groove (B),
 
   the groove (A) being a radially-extending groove that has an opening 
that allows a fluid to pass from the plate's first side to the plate's second side, 
the opening being disposed in the groove (A) at a peripheral end thereof, the 
groove (A) not permitting fluid passage from the plate's first side to plate's 
second side other than through the peripherally located opening,
 
 
   the groove (B) being a radially-extending groove that extends from a 
centrally-located, concentric groove towards a periphery of the plate to a 
concentric groove that communicates directly with the groove (A) at a first

directly with the groove (B) at a second open end. 
The separation-science medium support plate of claim 1, wherein 
the groove (A) extends from a medially-located, concentric, radially-spaced 

groove to a peripherally-located, concentric, radially-spaced groove. 
The separation-science medium support plate of claim 2, wherein 
groove (B) extends from the centrally-located, concentric groove to a 

peripherally-located concentric groove that communicates with groove (A) at 
a first open end and with groove (B) at a second open end.
