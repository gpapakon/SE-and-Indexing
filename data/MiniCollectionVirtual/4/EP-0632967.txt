<ABSTRACT>
A cigarette which is assembled by the smoker is provided. It 
comprises a tobacco rod 10 and a filter plug 12. The rod consists 

of a wrapped column of tobacco, the wrapping 16 of which extends 
beyond the end of the column to define a cavity 18. Unsmokeable 

tipping material 20 circumscribes the cavity. The cavity collapses 
if a smoker draws on it when empty. 
The smoker renders the cigarette smokeable by inserting a 
filter plug into the cavity in the tobacco rod.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to smoking articles such as 
cigarettes which are in part constructed by the smoker. Hand rolled cigarettes, in which a smoker wraps tobacco in a 
paper wrapper with or without a hand operated machine to make a 
cigarette, are well known. A more sophisticated alternative in the 
form of empty paper sleeves attached to a filter to be filled by the 
smoker with loose tobacco using a small machine, is also known. 
More recently, rods of tobacco wrapped in very porous paper have 
been supplied for use with empty paper sleeves carrying filters. 
The rods of tobacco cannot be smoked alone, since the wrapper is too 
porous. The smoker inserts the wrapped rod into the open end of the 
sleeve to make a filter cigarette. The sleeves, being of ordinary 
tobacco wrapping paper and having a relatively long unsupported 
empty portion, are thin and easily damaged. Even when the sleeve is 
not damaged, it can be difficult to insert the tobacco rod into the 
sleeve. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided 
a rod of smoking material comprising a wrapped column of smoking 
material, the wrapper of which extends beyond one end of the column 
to define a cylindrical cavity for the reception of a filter plug. 
Preferably, the cavity wall is constructed to collapse if a smoker 
attempts to draw on the rod through the empty cavity. This can be 
achieved by an appropriate choice of material and thickness of 
material for the cavity wall. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided 
a rod of smoking material comprising a wrapped column of smoking 
material having at one end a cylindrical cavity for the reception of 
a filter plug, the wall of the cavity being constructed to collapse 
under the pressure exerted by the mouth of a smoker. This can be  
 
achieved by an appropriate choice of material and thickness of 
material for the cavity wall. In a preferred embodiment of the 
second aspect, the cavity is formed by an extension of the column 
wrapper beyond one end of the column. In preferred embodiments of either aspect the cavity is 
circumscribed by tipping material, which is preferably unsmokeable. 
Preferred tipping material include paper and plastics materials. In 
the case of a rod in which the cavity is defined by the wrapping of 
the column, the tipping may extend beyond the mouth end of the 
cavity. The invention also contemplates a kit for making a smoking 
article comprising a rod having a cavity for the reception of a 
filter plug and,
