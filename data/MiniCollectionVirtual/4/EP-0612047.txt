<ABSTRACT>
So that, in all designs for plot boundaries, it can be determined very reliably that they are being climbed over, and this irrespective of the atmospheric conditions, a method is proposed for evaluating the signals from electro-acoustic transducers by means of an electronic circuit in which the information corresponding to the level and to the change in level (modulation) is taken from the incoming signal and the difference between the values of these items of information is determined. The difference value is subsequently compared with a threshold value and, when it overshoots the threshold value, an alarm signal is triggered.
