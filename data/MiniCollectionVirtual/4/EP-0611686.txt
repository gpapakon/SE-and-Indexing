<ABSTRACT>
An anti-theft device (1) intended for vehicles belongs to a type, 
which is capable of retaining the vehicle brake in a braking 

condition, as long as it is activated, and which is non-interfering 
with the brake in an inactivated condition. The anti-theft 

device (1) comprises a lock rod (3) provided at one end 
with hook or crook (5) for gripping around a brake pedal arm 

(26), the lock rod (3) to a major extent consisting of a shank 
portion (4), which is releasably lockable within a lock housing 

(2), which in turn is firmly secured to the vehicle in the 
vicinity of the brake pedal. The shank portion (4), which is 

provided with a helicoidal groove (6), extends through the lock 
housing and through a rotatably disposed element (14) therein, 

the hole for the shank portion (4) through the rotatable element 
(14) having a helicoidal ridge (16), which is complementary to 

the helicoidal groove (6) in the shank portion (4) and cooperates 
therewith. Displacement of the lock rod (3) thus results in 

rotation of the rotatable element (14). A latch (18) is biased 
into engagement with the rotatable element (14) in order to 

permit the rotation of the rotatable element (14) in only one of 
its two rotational directions. A solenoid (22) is provided to 

move the latch (18) out of engagement with the rotatable element 
(14) when energized and thereby permit the free rotation of the 

rotatable element (14) in both of the two directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-theft device intended for 
vehicles, and particularly to such an anti-theft device which, 
when activated, locks the brake pedal or the like in a braking 
condition. Vehicle thefts constitute a growing problem, which is highly 
costly both to society and to the insurance companies. Although 
various anti-theft devices exist, such devices do not prevent a 
moderately advanced thief from driving the vehicle off. Due to 
frequent false alarms, alarm signals in the form of light and 
sound signals emitted from a vehicle do not attract any particular 
attention, and, considering the risks involved, few people 
would approach a potential thief at the moment of theft. Various types of anti-theft devices exist, which are intended to 
prevent the vehicle from being driven. Probably, the most common 
type would be the steering wheel lock, this lock, however, being 
so weak as to be broken open by driving the vehicle with its 
front wheels up against a sidewalk edge. As a matter of fact, 
today the steering wheel lock is not considered to consistute a 
factual anti-theft device anymore. The same is true with respect 
to the gear lever locks, which may be opened by means of a 
screwdriver. The separate locks to be applied between the steering wheel and 
one of the pedals, which not only prevents the driving of the 
vehicle but also makes it practically impossible for a person to 
be seated in the driver's seat, are of a stronger type. However, 
such locks entrain practical drawbacks in being big and unwieldy 
and thereby, when not in use, hard to place anywhere in the 
vehicle, as well as in making their application and removal 
difficult. It has also proved to be easy to cut off the steering 
wheel, e.g. by means of an ordinary hack saw, for a quick and 
easy removal of the lock. It is true that attempts to achieve a locking of one of the 
vehicle pedals in a theft-preventing position have been made, see  
 
e.g. SE 8601557-5 and GB-2 210 344 A. In the first document a 
complicated holding-down mechanism is proposed, which is easily 
accessible from its mounting position. In the case of an 
mechanism error occurring, there is a risk of the normal function 
of the brake pedal being obstructed, this possibly leading to 
collisions and other accidents. Further, it is to be manoeuvered 
by a lock mechanism having a key, this being known today not to 
constitute any problem whatsoever to a thief in breaking it open. In the latter document, a mechanism is proposed, wherein the

An anti-theft device (1) for vehicles and belonging 
to a type, which retains the vehicle brake in a braking condition, 

when the anti-theft device is activated, which anti-theft 
device comprises a lock rod (3) provided at one end with a grip 

means (5) for gripping around a brake pedal arm (26) and arranged 
to be in a releasable locking engagement in a lock housing (2), 

the lock housing (2) being firmly secured to the vehicle, characterized 
in that the lock rod (3) has a shank portion (4) connected 

to the grip means (5) and having a helicoidal groove (6), 
which portion is intended to extend through the lock housing (2), 

that a rotatable element (14) is disposed within the lock housing 
(2) and is provided with a through hole for receiving the shank 

portion (4), which hole has a helicoidal ridge (16), which is 
complementary to the helicoidal groove (6) in the shank portion 

(4) and cooperating therewith, so that a displacement of the 
shank portion (4) of the lock rod (3) through the lock housing 

(2) rotates the rotatable element (14), that a latch (18) is 
biased into a locking engagement with the rotatable element (14) 

in order to prevent a rotation thereof in one of the rotational 
directions, and that a means (22,23) releasing the latch (18) is 

provided, which, when influenced, takes the latch (18) out of the 
engagement with the rotatable element (14) and enables the rotation 

thereof in both rotational directions. 
The anti-theft device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the means for releasing the latch consists of a solenoid 

(22) having an arm (23) connected thereto, the arm (23), as the 
solenoid is energized, being driven by the solenoid into contact 

against the latch (18) and to further pivoting thereof from the 
engagement position. 
The anti-theft device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the rotatable element (14) is provided around its 

periphery with a toothed wheel rim (17), and in that the latch  
 

(18) is provided with a toothed segment (19), the teeth being 
respectively arranged to be in engagement with each another. 
The anti-theft device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the latch (18) is pivotable around 

an axis (21), which is parallel to the rotational axis of the 
rotatable element (14) and biased through a spring (20) against 

the rotatable element (14), the latch (18) being extended to such 
a degree, that it, in a non-influenced condition, permits the 

rotation of the rotatable element (14) only in one of the two 
directions. 
The anti-theft device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the solenoid is controlled by means 

of an electronic unit (24), which in turn is controlled by a 
control unit (28), the electronic unit supplying current to 

manoeuver the solenoid (22) so as to release the latch provided 
that a particular code has been given at the control unit (28).
