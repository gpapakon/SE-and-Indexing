<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for predicting 
a video image on the basis of a preceding video 

image in the processing order for use in compressed 
transmission or storing of video images, 

wherein a prediction is generated for a video 
image to be encoded in an encoder encoding the 

video image on the basis of the preceding image 
in the processing order. The invention comprises 

dividing the preceding image in the processing 
order into blocks; selecting a point from each 

block of the preceding image in the processing 
order as the basic point (A, B, C, D) of the 

concerned block, the basic points of the different 
blocks dividing the preceding image in 

the processing order into quadrangle-shaped 
basic areas; searching the image to be encoded 

to find points (A', B', C', D') corresponding to 
the basic points (A, B, C, D) of the blocks of 

said preceding block in the processing order, 
the corresponding points dividing the image to 

be encoded into corresponding quadrangle-shaped 
areas; defining a motion vector for each pair of 

a basic point and a corresponding point, the 

motion vector indicating a displacement between 
the points; and performing a geometric transformation 

on the quadrangle-shaped basic areas 
so as to transform them into the size and shape 

of their corresponding areas for generating 
predictions for the corresponding areas of the 

image to be encoded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for predicting
a video image on the basis of a preceding video
image in a processing order for use in compressed
transmission or storing of video images, wherein a
prediction is generated for a video image to be encoded
in an encoder encoding the video image on the
basis of a preceding image in a processing order. The
invention relates especially to a prediction method
for use in video image compression to be applied
especially in so-called hybrid encoders based on
temporal prediction and transform encoding.In predictive video compression methods, a
transmitter (encoder) generates a prediction of an
image to be encoded by utilizing an image preceding in
the processing order, that is, in practice, in most
cases either the preceding or the following image. The
prediction is generated in a manner such that the same
prediction can be generated in a receiver (decoder)
while additionally utilizing transmitted control information.
Compression of an image is effected by
transmitting only the difference between the predicted
image and the actual image to the receiver, so that
the decoder is able to calculate the actual image on
the basis of the received prediction error and the
prediction image produced by it.The prediction error to be transmitted is usually
quantized to increase the compression ratio. The
image produced by the receiver is thereby not identical
with the transmitted image, and the encoding is
said to be lossy. It is to be noted that the encoder
is thus not able to generate the prediction on the
basis of the original image, which is not available to 
the decoder, but the encoder has to produce the same
image as the decoder.Prediction of an image may take place either
spatially, temporally, or as a combination thereof. In
spatial prediction, a prediction is generated from the
transmitted pixels of the image to be encoded. Temporal
prediction in turn utilizes images that have
already been transmitted and aims to utilize temporal
redundancy.Present-day compression methods are usually so-called
hybrid encoding methods. Such methods eliminate
temporal redundancy by temporal prediction, and
spatial redundancy is usually eliminated by discrete
cosine transform or so-called subband encoding (discrete
cosine transform may also be regarded as a
special case of subband encoding). As used in this
patent application, the expression transform encoding
refers to discrete cosine transform and subband encoding.
Transform encoding also includes other less
frequently used
