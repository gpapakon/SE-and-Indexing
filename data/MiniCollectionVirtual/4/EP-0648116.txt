<ABSTRACT>
Composition for delayed release of an active substance, such as a medicament, the active substance being incorporated in a polysaccharide matrix which is formed by an essentially crystalline straight-chain glucan, in particular an (alpha)-glucan which has a helix structure, such as amylodextrin or a fraction having a helix structure obtained from amylose V. The composition can contain an amount of active substance of from 0.1 to 80 % by weight and the active substance can, depending on the hydrophilicity, have a molecular weight of up to 500 or 1500 daltons. The active substance is released from the composition at a constant rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a composition for delayed release of an 
active substance in a target environment, the active substance being 
incorporated in a polysaccharide matrix. Compositions for delayed release of an active substance, for 
example for delayed release of a medicament for oral administration in the 
gastrointestinal tract of a mammal, have advantages, inter alia because 
the administration of the active substance can take place in a small 
number of doses and because a more constant concentration is obtained in 
the target environment. Compositions for delayed release are known in diverse forms. One 
form of delayed release can comprise the presence of a matrix containing 
the active substance therein, which matrix slowly dissolves in the water-containing 
environment and thus releases the active substance in a delayed 
manner; a composition of this type is, for example, disclosed in European 
Patent Application EP-A-241,179. A composition of this type in which the 
matrix is formed by a natural polysaccharide such as xanthan is disclosed 
in International Patent Application WO-A-87,05212. According to a variant 
thereof, the active substance is packaged in an insoluble capsule which 
is provided with a water-soluble stopper, as disclosed, inter alia, in 
British Patent Application 2,241,485. Another form of a composition for delayed release is a composition 
from which the active substance is released by erosion, as is disclosed, 
for example, in European Patent Application EP-A-381,182. Compositions for delayed release in which the matrix material is 
a β-glucan, such as cellulose or a cellulose derivative, are disclosed, 
inter alia, in International Patent Application WO-A-88,10284 and 
Netherlands Patent Application 87,02294 (= GB-A-2,195,893). The use of 
heat-modified starch as the matrix for the controlled release of 
medicaments for oral administration is described by J. Herman and J.P. 
Remon, Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 56, 51-63 and 65-70 (1989). Amylose, a straight-chain starch fraction, has also been proposed 
as a carrier material for active compounds: British Patent 1,072,795 
describes the use of "retrograded" amylose, i.e. associated amylose; 
EP-A-343,993 discribes the use of "glassy" amylose, i.e. one of the types 
of amorphous amylose, as a release-delaying material for active substances.  
 The known compositions for the delayed release of an active 
substance frequently have the disadvantage that release of the active 
substance does not proceed in accordance with an
