<ABSTRACT>
Human or animal tissue contaminants, such as cancer cells 
or viruses, are selectively removed from tissues by 

staining them with chromophores or similar energy 
transferring compounds and irradiating the stained 

elements with uniform laser light in a wavelength that is 
absorbed by the chromophore but is not significantly 

absorbed by surrounding health tissue; the energy released 
as heat by the chromophore to the contaminant is 

sufficient to irreversibly damage the contaminant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for removal of contaminants from human and animal,
tissues. The apparatus is particularly useful
for treatment of tumors.In medical circles, it is well known the widely proven
regression effect produced on primary and secondary tumors
by hyperthermia.Many studies, both biological and clinical, have been
successfully completed, relying on localized or total-body
hyperthermia.However the success rate, although non-negligible, is
absolutely unsatisfactory; the percentage of patients
showing total remission, without metastases originated
recurrence, is too low to qualify this particular therapy
as a basis for a cure.The reason for such a low efficacy cannot be attributed to
an unpredictable mechanism, upon which the treatment is
based, since heat induced cell necrosis is a well known
fact, no longer debatable. The reason why hyperthermia, as
cancer therapy, is only occasionally successful originates
from the fact that it relies on too small a difference in
irreversible-damage threshold-temperature between normal
and neoplastic cells.Such restriction is a necessary precaution for the safety
of the patient, since no method nor machine exists, as at 
today, to deliver the required heat only to the malignant
presence in the body.The use of elevated temperature for the treatment of
cancer goes back to ancient times as total-body
hyperthermia, while localized hyperthermia is a product of
relatively recent times, utilizing Radio Frequency or
Microwave technology and even laser energy sources.But again all of the above rely on the indiscriminate
exposure of tissue to elevated temperature and are
therefore restricted in scope because they must rely
exclusively on the questionable and variable higher
sensitivity to temperature displayed by malignant tumors.More recently fractionated doses of Radiofrequency
Hyperthermia have been proven effective, still relying on
the assumed greater heat sensitivity of neoplastic growth;
the procedures and results are described in Journal of
Dermatol. Surg. Oncology, Vol. 15 pages 845 to 849 (1989),
in an article entitled "Radiofrequency Hyperthermia
Therapy of Murine Melanoma: A Comparison of Fractionated
Versus Single-Dose Treatments".However even if encouraging, still the method is clumsy
and it is not backed by the existence of a commercially
viable hardware system.Although still experimental, one commercially available
technique called Photodynamic Therapy appears to resemble 
very closely the hereby introduced method (i.e.
QUETBISM),
