The kit comprises ion-exchange material having a measurable ion uptake potential for immobilizing available ions from the medium on the material following contact on the material with the medium or suspension. It also comprises means to remove particulate solids from the material after having contacted the medium with the material. Preferably, the ion-exchange material is cation and/or anion-exchange material in the form of rigid or flexible films, sheets, membranes or the like. The invention also relates to a method for the on-site in situ measurement of anion and/or cation availability in a solid medium and to a method for measuring free organic ions in cells from plant or animal tissue. It also relates to ion-exchange material for immobilizing available ions in soil, sediment or water media and to a cation and/or anion-exchange membrane buried underneath the surface of a soil sample or site, the membrane being in ion-exchange relationship with available ions in the soil. The present invention represents an improvement over the prior art in that it provides means for quickly determining ion availability in a particular media without the necessity of collecting media samples for laboratory testing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to techniques for the 
measurement of available ions in various media such as 
water, soil and sediments or for the measurement of 
free ions in disrupted cells. The techniques are based 
on the immobilization of ions on the surface of ion-exchange 
material. Particularly, the invention relates 
to techniques useful for on-site assessment of either 
nutrient availability in soils or sediments or free 
inorganic ions in plant material. A good soil test is one which is simple, 
rapid and can remove all or a representative portion of 
the available nutrient pool in a wide variety of soil 
types. Few existing tests excel in both these 
requirements. Methodology which provides the best 
estimate of nutrient availability is often too 
complicated and cumbersome for routine labs making 
fertilizer recommendations to producers. Furthermore, 
many existing P, N, S and K tests do not take into 
account all factors affecting nutrient availability in 
soil. Some tests are specific to a region or soil 
type, performing poorly when transposed to other 
environments. For example, P and K tests which are 
based on chemical removal of specific P and K fractions 
are usually limited in geographic scope since the 
importance of a fraction may vary depending on the 
physical and chemical environment of the soil. Anion-exchange resins are considered one of 
the better indices of plant available P. Cation-exchange 
resins have also been used for extraction of 
available K in soils. However, conventional resins in 
bead form are generally difficult to separate from soil 
and are not well-suited for routine analysis. Still,  
 
there are numerous prior art references teaching the 
use of ion-exchange resin beads to evaluate nutrient 
availability in soil samples. In Brazilian Patent 8605998, nutrients are 
extracted from soil samples for analysis using capsules 
with at least two opposite fabric walls containing 
standard amounts of ion-exchange resins which are 
placed in a beaker with a sealed cover. Measured 
amounts of dry soil and a fixed amount of water are 
added in the beaker, placed on a special tray and 
agitated in a specially built machine by free tumbling. 
Beakers are taken to a washer-separator and washed with 
deionized water to remove soil and other particles. 
The capsules are then transferred to a clean beaker 
containing a solution of NaCl and HCl. The resulting 
solution contains the substances to be analyzed and the 
resin is regenerated by washing with successive 
solutions to
