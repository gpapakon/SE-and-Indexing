<ABSTRACT>
An auto-focusing method in a microprocessor controlled liquid crystal projector comprises the 
steps of displaying a first indication on a screen, while auto-focusing is being performed and 

displaying a second indication on the screen that represents auto-focalization when a focused 
state has been reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a auto-focusing method in a liquid crystal projector.Fig. 4 is a block diagram illustrating one example of a prior art liquid crystal projector. 500
designates a power supply switch, and 501 is a power supply unit for supplying electric power
to a drive control circuit unit 505. A bimetal thermostat 504 is connected between the power
supply unit 501 and a lamp 503 forming a projection light source. The thermostat 504 cuts off
the supply of electric power to the lamp 503, when a predetermined temperature is reached, for
instance when an air vent is blocked so that the interior of the liquid crystal projector cannot be
sufficiently cooled by a cooling fan 502. A signal input terminal 506 is connected to the drive
control circuit unit 505. A liquid crystal light valve 507 is driven by the drive control circuit unit
505. Projection light modulated by the liquid crystal light valve 507 is focused by means of a
projection lens 508 on a screen to form an image thereon.One example of such a liquid crystal projector is disclosed for instance in JP-A-63-133872.In the above-described prior art liquid crystal projector focalization of the lens is performed by a
manual operation. Considering a normal mode of use of the liquid crystal projector, there exists a
big distance in position between the liquid crystal projector body, the screen and the user
(viewer). This in turn presents a problem of causing inconvenience incidental to the operation.It is an object of the present invention to remedy the problems described above and to provide
an auto-focusing method in a microprocessor controlled liquid crystal projector constructed to
improve the operability.This object is achieved with auto-focusing method as claimed. A preferred embodiment of the
invention is subject-matter of the dependent claim.With the liquid crystal projector to which the present invention is applied, the inputs from the
input unit, the non-lighting detector and the temperature detector serve to control the main
power supply control unit, the light source power supply control unit, the input changeover unit,
the D/A converter, the lens control unit, the alarm unit, the fan motor control unit and the
display unit by use of the input means, the command discriminating means, the power supply
control means, the input changeover means, the picture processing means, the voice processing
means, the lens control means, the timer means, the alarm issuing means, the fan motor control
means, the non-lighting detection means,

<CLAIMS>
An auto-focusing method in a microprocessor controlled liquid crystal projector
comprising the steps of


(a) detecting an auto-focus command,
(b) effecting, in response to said detecting in step (a), display of a first indication on a
screen indicating that auto-focusing is being executed, and applying an auto-focus signal (AFC)

to a lens controller (260) to perform auto-focusing,
(c) detecting that a focused state has been reached, and
(d) effecting display of a second indication on the screen indicating that the focused
state has been reached in response to said detecting in step (c).
The method of claim 1 in a liquid crystal projector equipped with infrared remote
control means further comprising the step of suspending said auto-focusing while an infrared

light beam from said remote control means is being received.
