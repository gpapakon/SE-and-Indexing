<ABSTRACT>
A reading apparatus (1) comprising an image 
reading means for reading a sheet original (P) positioned 

at a reading position and an automatic original 
convey means for supplying the sheet original onto 

the reading position and wherein the sheet original 
can be read through an image flow reading mode while 

the sheet original (P) is being conveyed by the automatic 
original convey means by fixing the image reading 

means at any position. It further comprises a convey 
path (B) for directing the sheet original to the reading 

position, and a control means for initiating 
conveyance of the sheet original (P) waiting at a 

predetermined position in the convey path (B) in response 
to a flow reading mode start signal during the image 

flow reading mode and for initiating the image flow 
reading mode by outputting an image tip signal when a 

tip end of the sheet original (P) reaches a flow reading 
image tip position (H) .

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reading
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention relates further to an image forming apparatus using such
a reading apparatus. More particularly, it relates
to an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine,
a laser beam printer and the like having a sheet convey
apparatus for conveying a sheet to a predetermined
position such as an image reading portion.Automatic original feeding apparatuses are
grouped into an original circulating type (RDF) and
an original non-circulating type (ADF). In case of
the original feeding apparatuses of RDF type, exposure
regarding an original is effected while the original
is being passed through an exposure portion, and then
the original is discharged above (or below) an original
stacking portion. Further, when a plurality of same
copies are desired, the originals are successively
re-circulated.Thus, since combination of a flow-reading mode
wherein the exposure regarding the original is effected
while the original is being moved and the original
feeding apparatus of RDF type does not require to shift
an exposure device in comparison with a stationary 
reading mode wherein the original is temporarily
stopped and then the exposure apparatus must be shifted
along an original area, exchange time for exchanging
originals can be reduced and the copying system can
be operated at a high speed, thereby providing high
productivity. Further, comparing with the above-mentioned
combination and the stationary reading mode
with respect to a predetermined original exchange time,
the above-mentioned combination permits the circulation
of originals at an original shifting speed slower than
that of the stationary reading mode, thereby reducing
noise.Referring to the combination of the flow reading
mode and the RDF, the copying system can have further
high speed operation and high productivity by further
combining it with a flash exposure technique. Although
detailed explanation of the flash exposure technique
is omitted, in comparison with the aforementioned
exposure device, the flash exposure device is so designed
as to expose the entire surface of the original
simultaneously and that it requires a high power light
source and a photosensitive body of belt type, thereby
making the device bulky, expensive and high power
consumption. Thus, the use of the flash exposure
technique is limited to large high-speed operated copying
machines.On the other hand, the above-mentioned original 
feeding apparatus of ADF type is designed so that

a convey path (PH3) for directing a sheet original
(P
n
) to a reading position (H,G);
an image reading means (133, 133') for reading the
sheet original (P
n
