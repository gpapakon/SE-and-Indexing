<ABSTRACT>
A device for simultaneously transmitting a plurality of television signals 
comprises an adjusting circuit (5) for adjusting the bitrate for each television signal in 

dependence upon the complexity of this signal with respect to the joint complexity of 
the plurality of television signals. The de
vice provides improvement of quality in Digital 
Video Broadcast systems. It has also been found to be possible to transmit extra signals 

through a given channel while maintaining the picture quality. Use of the device in 
optical recording provides the possibility of a longer playing time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for transmitting a
plurality of television signals through a transmission channel having a predetermined channel
bitrate comprising: encoding each one of said plurality of television signals in a respective bit
stream; combining the respective bit streams to a channel bit stream; and controlling the
bitrate of each bit stream in proportion to the complexity of the corresponding television signal
with respect to the joint complexity of the other television signals. The invention also relates
to a method of storing a television signal and playing back said signal.A method defined in the opening paragraph is disclosed in NTC'77
Conference Record, Vol.3, 1977, New York, pages 41:4-1 to 41:4-6, H. Kaneko et al. "Digital
Transmission of Broadcast Television with reduced Bit Rate." It allows a plurality of
television signals to be simultaneously transmitted through one digital transmission channel,
the channel capacity allocated to each signal corresponding with the signal complexity.The prior art device exploits the fact that upon transmission of a
plurality of television signals through one transmission channel not all television signals are
simultaneously complicated. For example, if two television signals A and B are transmitted
and if, at a given moment, signal A comprises a scene which is not so complex and signal B
comprises a very complex scene, signal B will be temporarily transmitted at a higher bitrate at
the expense of the bitrate of signal A. This process of dynamic allocation of bitrates will
hereinafter be referred to as "joint bitrate control".The method is suitable for use in Digital Video Broadcast (DVB)
systems. Inter alia, the MPEG2 standard which is being developed is suitable for encoding
each television signal.It is an object of the invention to further improve the prior art method. To this end the method according to the invention, as set out in claims 1, 5 and 6, is characterized by
the step of determining the complexity of each signal by encoding each picture of said signal
and counting the number of bits for encoding said picture, the complexity being determined by
said number of bits.The invention is based on the recognition that buffer occupancy is not
an adequate representation of signal complexity because a plurality of encoded pictures are
temporarily stored in each encoder buffer at any time. The invention overcomes this problem
by determining the complexity in terms of the number of bits for encoding each picture.The complexity can be measured
