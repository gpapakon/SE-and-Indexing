<ABSTRACT>
To avoid unnecessary down time, in data processing systems, particularly numerical control systems, the dynamic read-write memory (D) is only rewritten if a reset signal (RU) which is caused by a power failure is present. For reset signals with other causes, the central processor (CPU) recognises from test information (WT) which is produced in the dynamic read-write memory (D) that its content has been completely retained.

Method for generating a reset signal in data 
processing equipment, in particular for numerical 

controls, having at least one processor (CPU), a 
program memory (E) and a dynamic read-write memory (D) 

which is connected to bus lines (AD/SB) by way of a 
data driver (T), having the following steps: 


1.1
the reset-input (ER) of the dynamic read-write 
memory (D) is only activated when there is voltage 

failure, 
1.2
test information (WT), which is known to the data 
processing equipment, is written into a 

preselected test memory cell (AO) of the dynamic 
read-write memory (D), 
1.3
if the processor (CPU) detects a bus-reset-signal 
(R
B
), read access to the test memory cell (AO) is 
effected, 
1.4
if the bus reset-signal (R
B
) was generated on 
account of a voltage failure (R
U
, R ' / U), the read 
access to the test memory cell (AO) is blocked and 

preselected comparison information which deviates 
from the test information (WT) is generated on the 

data bus, 
1.5
otherwise the contents of the test memory cell 
(AO) are read, 
1.6
the information present on the data bus after the 
read access is compared with the known test 

information (WT), 
1.7
if there is inequality of the information, the 
dynamic read-write memory (D) is initialized anew 

and written, 
1.8
if there is equality of the information, the 
contents of the dynamic read-write memory remain 

unchanged. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein for the 
purpose of checking whether a bus-reset-signal occurred
  
 

whilst data was being loaded into the dynamic read-write 
memory, load information, which deviates from the 

test information (WT) and from the comparison 
information, is only stored in the test memory cell 

(AO) of the dynamic read-write memory (D) for the 
length of time during which said memory (D) is being 

loaded.
