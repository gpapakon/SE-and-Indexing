<ABSTRACT>
A process and a machine are described for filling containers 
(14) with cosmetic products (15) even having different 

characteristics. The machine comprises at least one unit (53) 
that executes a succession of similar processing cycles, each 

of which comprises the loading of at least one loading cell 
(10) with a cosmetic product (15), and the levelling of the 

cosmetic product (15) itself inside said loading cell (10), the 
transfer and compacting of said cosmetic product (15) loaded 

inside said loading cell (10) inside a pick-up cell (7), the 
transfer of the compacted cosmetic product (16) from said 

pick-up cell (7) to a collection container (14) and the final 
pressing of the compacted cosmetic product in the collection 

container (14) itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention has as the object a process and a 
machine for filling containers with cosmetic products even 
having different characteristics. A process and a machine are known (EP-A-561 444) that provide for the 
formation of tablets of cosmetic product, obtained starting 
from a levelled layer of cosmetic product, moved by a conveyor 
belt, through apportionment of the product itself by means of 
die cutters and subsequent compression of the product itself by 
means of thrust pistons associated with the die cutters; the 
tablets are then transferred by the same die cutters inside 
special containers, located on a rotating support, where they 
are subjected to a final pressing. A machine for executing the abovementioned process is, 
however, complicated and expensive. Due to the type of pick-up 
made, it is, moreover, exposed to drawbacks such as spreading 
of cosmetic product with residues outside the die cutter, and 
in general to problems of cleanliness. A further problem with which such machine is afflicted is 
linked with the fact that the values of pressure exerted by 
said thrust pistons cannot be very high (they do not usually 
exceed 300 kg/cm2), due to the flexibility of the conveyor 
belt; on the other hand, cosmetic products are met in practice 
with characteristics such as to require even substantial 
pressures, for example 800 kg/cm2. Lastly, the use of the abovementioned machine for filling 
containers with more than one cosmetic products having  
 
different characteristics becomes difficult, requiring more 
than one strip of product to be placed side by side on the 
conveyor belt; the thrust piston, exerting the same pressure on 
portions of different products, gives rise to burrs and 
differences in height, where the latter can be eliminated but 
partially by a final compression of the product after it has 
been placed inside the container. A machine is also known wherein the cosmetic product is 
loaded directly inside the container, placed in a plate 
provided with suitable cells for housing the containers 
themselves; subsequently, again through the use of a thrust 
piston, the cosmetic product is pressed inside said container. In view of the described state of the art, the object of the 
present invention is to provide a process and a machine for 
filling containers with cosmetic products that do not exhibit 
the mentioned problems, and that can be applied with ease to 
simultaneous use with cosmetic products having different 
characteristics. According to the present

Process for filling containers with cosmetic products, 
comprising a step wherein at least one loading cell (10) is 

loaded with a cosmetic product (15), and the same cosmetic 
product (15) is levelled inside said loading cell (10), 

characterized in that it also comprises the following 
successive steps: 


a) transfer and compacting of said cosmetic product (15) loaded 
inside said loading cell (10) inside a pick-up cell (7) placed 

over it; 
b) transfer of the compacted cosmetic product (16) from said 
pick-up cell (7) to a collection container (14) and 
c) final pressing of the compacted cosmetic product (16) inside 
said container (14). 
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that it 
comprises a repetition of operating cycles, in each of which 

the abovementioned step of loading the cosmetic product (15) is 
executed during the step of transferring the compacted product 

(16) of the previous cycle. 
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that it 
comprises the execution of identical out-of-step cycles for the 

filling of portions of said collection container (14) with 
tablets (16) of a different cosmetic product, that are lastly 

subjected to a common final pressing. 
Machine for the execution of the process according to 
claim 1, constituted by at least one unit (53) comprising 

feeding means (1, 2) and levelling means (3) of a cosmetic 
product (15) inside at least one loading cell (10) obtained in 

an operating surface (9), characterized in that said unit (53) 
also comprises a transfer and compacting device (60) that can  

 
be moved from a position where it receives the cosmetic product 

(15) from said loading cell (10) and a position where the 
cosmetic product (16) is unloaded into a collection container 

(14) and comprising at least one pick-up cell (7) that can be 
placed alternately over said loading cell (10) and over said 

collection container (14) according to the position of said 
device (60), thrust means (11) associated with said loading 

cell (10) to execute the transfer of said cosmetic product (15) 
from said loading cell (10) to said pick-up cell (7) when said 

device (60) is in the receiving position and opposing means (8) 
associated with said pick-up cell (7) to co-operate with said 

thrust means (11) for compacting the cosmetic product (15) 
during said transfer of the product (15) itself and to 

subsequently execute the unloading of the compacted cosmetic 
product (16) into said collection container (14) when said 

movable device (60) is in the unloading position.
