<ABSTRACT>
A nasal positive airway pressure device is provided 
having a pair of nasal members each having a cannula tip to 

be inserted into the nares of the patient. Each cannula is 
tapered from a substantially circular cross-section 

outside the patient's nostril to a substantially oval cross-section 
at the tip inserted into the nostril. An inflatable 

cuff surrounds each cannula with the interior space of the 
cuff communicating with the lumen of the cannula through 

at least one aperture in the side wall of the cannula. The 
nasal members are connected to one or more flexible 

hoses which, in turn, are connected to a source of positive 
air pressure. In use, positive air pressure is supplied to 

the each cannula tip through the air hoses and nasal 
members. The positive air pressure inflates the cuffs to 

hold the nasal members in place and to effect treatment. 
The tapered tip configuration, soft inflatable cuffs and 

adjustable positioning of the nasal members and tip 
provide a device which is more comfortable to the user. A 

variable diameter orifice for nasal positive airway 
pressure treatment is also contemplated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for treating sleep apnea. More specifically, the 
present invention provides a nasal positive airway 
pressure device which is reliable and comfortable to wear 
and, consequently, more acceptable to the patient. 
Methods of making and using the device are also disclosed. Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which the 
patient's airway passage is blocked and no air can pass to 
the lungs during sleep. During a customary sleep period a 
person suffering from sleep apnea can experience so-called 
apneic events. Apneic events are periods when the 
patient's airway becomes blocked, often for ten seconds or 
more, until the patient rouses from sleep and starts 
breathing normally again. Those suffering from sleep 
apnea may experience numerous apneatic events each 
night, causing a deficiency of restful sleep and, due to 
depleted oxygen levels, possible long term health 
problems such as heart ailments. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and, more 
specifically, nasal continuous positive airway pressure 
(nCPAP) has been shown to be an effective treatment for 
sleep apnea. See "Benefit of Nasal CPAP in Obstructive 
Sleep Apnea is Due to Positive Pharyngeal Pressure", N.C. 
Abbey, K.R. Cooper and J.A. Kwentus, Sleep 1989, 12 
(5):420-422; "The Effect of Nightly Nasal CPAP Treatment 
on Underlying Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Pharyngeal 
Size", N.A. Collopp. A.J. Block and D. Hellard, Chest 1991, 
99:855-860; and "Nasal Continuous Positive Airway  
 
Pressure Facilitates Respiratory Muscle Function During 
Sleep in Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease", 
B.J. Petrof, R.J. Kimoff, R.D. Levy, M.G. Cosoi and S.B. 
Gottfried, Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 143:928-935. This 
treatment involves applying a constant supply of gas, 
typically a mixture of air supplemented with moisture 
vapor or oxygen, to the nasal passages at a predetermined, 
slightly elevated pressure in order to prevent negative 
pressure conditions within the passageway. More recently, a related form of treatment has been 
tested and may achieve success similar to nCPAP. In this 
treatment, known as BiPAP™ therapy, a controller 
regulates the gas pressure in response to the patient's 
breathing patterns and supplies positive gas pressure at a 
first gas pressure during the inspiratory phase, i.e., 
inhalation by the patient, and supplies gas at a second, 
reduced pressure during the expiratory phase, i.e., as the 
patient exhales. The first gas pressure typically
