<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for shrinking a foil hood (2) which consists of heat-shrinkable material and which is drawn over a load (1) located on a pallet. In this case, the object is to avoid bondings or fusions with foils which themselves surround the load units. For this purpose, excess air pressure is generated in a known way within the foil hood, so that the foil hood is kept at a distance from the surface of the load. According to the invention, the excess air pressure within the foil hood is brought about solely by heating the air located in the foil hood, and shrinkage takes place during the vertical movement of a shrinkage frame (5) enclosing the load, the method parameters being regulated in such a way that the shrinkage forces exceed the air pressure within the foil hood during the entire shrinking operation. The air pressure within the hood is thus lowered continuously to a predetermined level.

Method for shrinking a film hood (2) of heat 
shrinkable material which is drawn over a palletized 

load, having the following steps: 

a) folding over and fixing the edge of the hood under 
the load or the pallet, 
b) generating a superatmospheric air pressure within 
the film hood, 
c) shrinking the film hood (2) by heat application, in 
order to bring the film hood up against the load, 

overcoming the internal air pressure, characterized 
in that 
d) the superatmospheric air pressure within the film 
hood is produced just by heating the film hood and 

the air in it, 
e) the shrinking takes place during the vertical movement 
of a shrinkage frame (5) enclosing the load, 
f) by controlling the output of a controllable suction 
blower (3) during the entire shrinkage operation, 

the air pressure within the film hood is lowered to 
the extent that it remains higher than the external 

air pressure, but allows the film hood to be shrunk 
and brought up against the load. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the output of the suction blower (3) is controlled 

in dependence on the vertical speed of the shrinkage 
frame (5). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that there additionally takes place a controlling of the 

air pressure by controlling the vertical speed of the  
 

shrinkage frame (5). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that there additionally takes place a controlling of the 

air pressure by controlling the heat output of the 
shrinkage frame (5). 
Method according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the controlling is performed in dependence on the 

shrinkage temperature. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that two or more of the control parameters 

according to Claims 1 to 5 are used in combination 
with one another. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the folding over and fixing of the 

edge of the hood under the load or the pallet is performed 
by grippers. 
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that, after folding over, the edge of the hood is 

securely held by the grippers during the shrinking of the 
rest of the hood. 
Method according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized 
in that the edge of the hood is shrunk on underneath the 

load before the shrinking of the rest of the hood. 
Method according to Claims 7 and 9, characterized 
in that, after the shrinking on of the edge of the hood 

and before the shrinking of the rest of the hood, the 
grippers are released. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, during the shrinking, the inflated 

film hood is compressed on the narrow sides of the pallet 
stack, over the entire height of the latter, along a 

vertical centre line.

method according to one of the preceding claims, having 

a shrinkage frame (5), which can move vertically along 
the pallet load (1), and a suction blower (3), characterized 

in that the shrinkage installation has a securing 
device, which fixes the film (2) on the lower edge of the 

pallet during shrinking, and in that a controllable  
 

suction blower (3) is provided for lowering the initial 
air pressure to the required extent within the film hood 

(2) during the entire shrinkage operation. 
Shrinkage installation according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that the securing device comprises 

grippers which are fastened on the shrinkage frame (5). 
Shrinkage installation according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that the securing device is arranged on 

a conveyor belt, which serves for transporting the 
pallets to the individual processing stations. 
Shrinkage installation according to Claim 12,
