<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is a process for 
preparing racemic or optically active epibatidine of 

formula 

which comprises subjecting racemic or optically active epi-epibatidine 
of formula 


to epimerization in the presence of a base or cyclising a 
1-[diacylamino]
-2-[6'-chloro)-pyrid-3'-yl]-4-[amino]
-cyclohexane 
of general formula  
wherein 

Ac
stands for an acyl group. 
 
 
 
The advantage of the process is that readily available 
starting materials are used and the procedure is suitable 

for industrial scale productions, too.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with a process for 
preparing an organic compound, namely epibatidine, i. e. 
2-[6'-(chloro)-pyrid-3'-yl]-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 
of formula 
 
Epibatidine is a minor alkaloid isolated from the skin 
extracts of an Ecuadoran frog, Epipedobates tricolor, 
of the family Dendrobatidae. Considering the chemical 
structure it is the first natural substance containing 
a 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton. To the exo 
position of the said skeleton a 2-(chloro)-pyrid-3-yl 
substituent is attached, which can rarely be found in 
nature. The alkaloid possesses a valuable biological 
property, namely it has 200 times the analgesic potency 
of morphine. The mechanism of the analgesic effect is 
different from that of morphine, as it does not subside 
upon administering morphine antagonists, e.g. 17--(allyl)-4,5α-(epoxy)-3,14-di-(hydroxy)-morphinan-6--one 
[naloxone] (T. F. Spande, H. M. Garraffo, M. W. 
Edwards, H. J. C. Yeh, L. Pannell, J. W. Daly: J. Am. 
Chem. Soc., 1992, 114, 3 475 to 3 478). Several processes have been disclosed in the 
literature for the synthetic preparation of 
epibatidine:  
 
A) Ch. A. Broka: Tetrahedron Letters, 34 [1993], 
3 251 to 3 254. In this reaction an adduct was 
prepared by the Diels-Alder reaction of enal 
obtained by the homologization of 6-(chloro)-nicotinic 
aldehyde and 2-(trimethylsilyloxy)-1,3-butadiene, 
it was then reduced with lithium, 
sodium and potassium tri-2-butyl borohydride [L--selectride®], 
the hydroxy group of the product 
was protected by silylation, while the hydroxymethyl 
substituent was first converted into the 
hydroxy group in 6 reaction steps and then 
benzoylated. By selective removal of the 
protecting groups the dihydroxy derivative was 
converted into 4-(mesyloxy)-cyclohexylamine 
containing a 6-(chloro)-pyridyl substituent, and 
the boiling of the latter compound in dichloromethane 
resulted in racemic epibatidine.  B) J. W. Daly, T.F. Spande, H. M. Garraffo: US Dept. 
Health and Human Service, WO 93/18037. The key 
intermediate of this synthesis is 3-(pyridyl)-2-cyclohexa-1,3-diene, 
which was prepared from 
cyclohexane-1,2-dione and converted into Diels-Alder 
adduct with tert.butylnitrosoformiate. The 
adduct was hydrogenated catalytically, the thus-obtained 
aminoalcohol derivative the amino group 
of which is protected by a tert.-butylformate 
group was treated with thionyl chloride, the 
product, the corresponding 1-[pyrid-3'-yl]-2-[chloro]-5-[amino]-cyclohexane 
protected on the 
nitrogen atom of the amino
