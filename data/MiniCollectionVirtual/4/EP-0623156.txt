<DESCRIPTION>
 SELF-REINFORCED COMPOSITE AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAMETECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to self-reinforced polymer composites and processes for preparing the same, in which the composite is in the form of a shaped article and in particular an injection molded or extruded article. More particularly, this invention relates to articles and processes of this type in which the self-reinforced polymer composite comprises first and second polymers having overlapping melt processing temperature ranges and in which at least one of the polymers (the second) is a liquid crystal polymer, and in which processing is carried out under conditions that fibers of the second polymer are formed and are then preserved in the ensuing shaping operation.BACKGROUND ARTFiber reinforced polymer composites are well known and widely used. Polymers of improved strength and increased stiffness can be obtained by use of an appropriate reinforcing fiber. Probably the most widely used reinforcing fibers are glass, carbon and aramid.The base polymers used in making polymer composites such as those described above include a wide range of thermoplastics, such as polystyrene and copolymers 

thereof, polyamides, polycarbonate, polyetheramide, polyetherketone (PEEK) and polyesters such as polybutylene terephthalate. These polymers may either be amorphus or semi-crystalline. They may be called flexible chain polymers, since individual monomer units in the polymer chain are free to rotate with respect to each other so that the polymer chain will assume a random shape. Numerous references, including by way of illustration, F. N. Cogswell, Intern. Polymer Processing, vol. 1, no. 4, pp 157-165 (1987) disclose such polymers.U.S. Patent No. 4,820,568 to Harpell et al discloses a multi-layer composite laminate comprising a plurality of prepreg layers, in which each layer comprises high strength preformed fibers of a conventional fiber reinforcing material, (e.g., carbon, graphite, cellulose or metal) in a flexible chain polymer matrix.Self-reinforced polymer composites comprising microscopic liquid crystal (or wholly aromatic polyester) fibers formed in situ in a matrix of flexible chain thermoplastic polymer have been developed in recent years. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,728,698 and 4,835,047 both to Isayev et al, illustrate such composites. The essentially unidirectionally oriented fibers are formed by application of high strain mixing conditions. 

 Also known are polymer blends of two or more melt processable wholly aromatic polyesters, each of

STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
Table I on page 25 of the specification has been amended by changing the tensile strength value "336" (which is for a control sample) to "36". This corrects a typographical error. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that "336" is clearly erroneous and that the correct tensile strength value should be lower than either of the two preceding tensile strength values on the same line. The error resulted from accidentally typing "3" twice.
Claims 1, 6 and 11 have been amended by specifying in each of the claims, that the temperature referred to in clause (c) of each claim is the blend temperature and not some other temperature (as for example the mold wall temperature).
U.S. Patent No. 4,992,514 to Schultze, et al, does not disclose the blend temperature during shaping of the polymer blend therein in a mold. References to temperature in column 2, lines 29 - 36 (beginning with "the preforms" in line 29) and in column 3, lines 12 - 13 of Schultze, et al, refer to a subsequent step and require a temperature lower than that specified in step (c) of each of claims 1, 6 and 11.
Claim 10 has been amended to change the claim dependency and thereby correct an obvious error.
It is believed that the claims of the invention as now presented define over the prior art of record and that discovered as a result of the International Search Report. Care was exercised by Applicant's attorney to make certain that these amendments did not go beyond the disclosure of the international application as filed. The amended claims are thought to more clearly define the elements of the present invention and are fully supported in the specification of the application as filed.
