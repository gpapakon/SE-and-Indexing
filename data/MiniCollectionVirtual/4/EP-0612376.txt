<ABSTRACT>
A capacitive discharge ignition system is described that incorporates a two-terminal passive network for controlling the discharge of a capacitive energy storage device into an igniter plug, wherein the network comprises a solid-state switch for alternately providing high and low ohmic paths between the two terminals in order to selectively connect the capacitive energy storage device to the igniter plug. The passive network includes means responsive to a predetermined value of a voltage differential ((Delta)V) between the two terminals for effecting the switching of the path between the two terminals provided by the solid-state switch from a high ohmic value to a low ohmic value, thereby controllably discharging the capacitive energy storage device into the igniter plug. In the illustrated embodiment, the solid-state switch is a series of SCRs, each of whose anode is connected to the trigger input of the SCR by way of a breakover diode (BOD).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a capacitive discharge 
ignition system according to the preamble of claim 1 and more 
particularly relates to ignition systems that provide high 
energy ignition sparks at consistent voltage levels. An ignition system according to the preamble of claim 1 is 
known from GB-A-1 108 636 disclosing a transistor circuit as 
means responsive to a predetermined value of a voltage 
differential and further disclosing a diode included into the 
discharge circuit to prevent the application of reverse 
voltage and simultaneously having a fly wheel effect. Further, IEEE-IAS-1985 ANNUAL MEETING Vol. CH2207-9, October 
1985, ROYAL YORK HOTEL, TORONTO, CANADA pages 935 - 939, 
H. LAWATSCH ET AL "protection of thyristors against 
overvoltage with bod break-over diodes", discloses the 
possibility of achieving overvoltage protection by connecting 
a break-over diode (BOD) between anode and gate of a 
thyristor in such a way that it is turned on when excessive 
voltage occurs. In a further capacitive discharge system disclosed in 
EP-A-0 214 756 the gate of a transistor can be triggered to 
short circuit a resistor and hence increase the forward 
voltage across each of at least two series connected SCR's so 
as to cause break over thereof. In this known capacitive  
 
discharge system operating as a pulser circuit a diode 
insures that only negative pulses pass to the output 
terminal. Another capacitor discharge ignition system is disclosed in 
US-A-4 449 497 and comprises a speed control arrangement and 
a temperature compensation arrangement the latter being 
provided by the series combination of a resistor and a 
termistor connected between the cathode and the gate of an 
SCR. Generally, ignition systems for igniting fuel in turbine 
engines have been in wide use since the 1950s. Although 
a great variety of systems exists today, their basic 
architecture has remained fundamentally unchanged over 
time. The most typical ignition system for turbine 
engines is a capacitive discharge type. For this type of 
ignition system, a switch is typically employed to 
control the discharge of a storage capacitor into an 
igniter plug located in a combustion chamber of the gas 
turbine. Historically, a gas-filled device containing a 
spark gap has functioned as the switch in these ignition 
systems. Such devices provide a "passive" switch in that 
they do not require application of an external power 
supply in order to function properly. Instead, these 
devices simply employ a single input and
