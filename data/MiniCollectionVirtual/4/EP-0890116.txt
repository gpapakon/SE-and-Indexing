<ABSTRACT>
A remote alpha source location method and a device therefor are disclosed. According to the method for remotely locating alpha particle sources (14) in an environment, a nitrogen-containing gas filling said environment (10, 30) is used to convert the alpha particles from the sources (14) into ultraviolet radiation, and an image of the UV radiation is formed on a light-sensitive surface (20). The image may be displayed on a video screen and superimposed on the visible image of the field being observed. Said method and device are useful for radiation protection and for sensing the presence of radioactive gases.
