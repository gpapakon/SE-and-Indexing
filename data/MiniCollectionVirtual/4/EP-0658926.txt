<ABSTRACT>
Argon gas is supplied into a vacuum chamber (3) having a 
target of titanium (2) for depositing a titanium layer (5) on a silicon 

substrate (3), and argon gas mixingly containing nitrogen is then 
supplied into the vacuum chamber (1) for depositing a titanium 

nitride layer (6) on the titanium layer (5). Thereafter, argon gas is 
again supplied into the vacuum chamber for removing nitrogen 

stuck to the surface of the target (2) and also for depositing a 
titanium-nitrogen mixture layer (9) on the titanium nitride layer (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a 
semiconductor device having, on its semiconductor substrate of 
silicon, a highly integrated metallic wiring layer low in 
parasitic resistance. With the demand for high integration of a semiconductor 
integrated circuit, the following is encountered in the active 
high-concentration diffusion layer formed on a silicon substrate 
(for example, the source/drain area in a MOS transistor 
or the emitter/base area in a bipolar transistor). That is, the 
depth of the p-n junction portion is shallower and the contact 
interface portion (contact portion) between the high-concentration 
diffusion layer and the metallic wiring layer, is 
reduced in area. In such a semiconductor device, in order to 
maintain, as ohmic and low, the electric resistance (contact 
resistance) at the interface between the active high-concentration 
diffusion layer and the metallic wiring layer and 
also in order to prevent the metal forming the metallic wiring 
layer from diffusing into the silicon substrate, it is inevitably 
required to dispose, between the high-concentration 
diffusion layer and the metallic wiring layer on the silicon 
substrate, a barrier layer formed by high-melting-point metal 
or a compound thereof. Such a barrier layer is also required 
when forming a contact portion between a silicon substrate and 
a resistor or electrode made of polycrystal silicon.  When an aluminium alloy (Al-Si-Cu) is used as the 
material of the metallic wiring layer, a titanium nitride (TiN) 
layer may be used as the barrier layer. Dependent on the 
forming method, such a titanium nitride layer has very effective 
barrier properties capable of restraining the diffusion, 
into the silicon substrate, of copper and aluminium in the 
metallic wiring layer when a heat treatment is conducted at 
500°C. This is reported in, for example, "Journal of Vacuum 
Science and Technology" 21 (1982), PP 14-18. In a barrier layer formed by a titanium nitride layer, 
however, the contact resistance becomes high particularly on a 
p-type high-concentration diffusion layer. To lower the contact 
resistance, it is required to dispose a titanium (Ti) layer 
between the titanium nitride layer and the high-concentration 
diffusion layer on the silicon substrate. This is because the 
titanium layer has the property of reducing the natural oxide 
layer on the silicon substrate and because the titanium layer 
is lower in the height of a Schottky barrier to a p-type 
silicon substrate than the titanium
