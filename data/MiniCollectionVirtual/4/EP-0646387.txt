<ABSTRACT>
A catheter introducer assembly (10) is discloded. The 
assembly is made up of a winged catheter introducer (10) having 

a catheter (12), an intermediate member (14) attached to the 
catheter (12) and a flexible tube (16) attached to the 

intermediate member (14). Disposed axially within the catheter 
(12) is a sharp needle (24). The needle (24) is secured to 

a stylet (32) which in turn is connected to a bead (38). The 
bead (38) is slidable in the tube (16). Secured to the outside 

of the tube (16) is a hard tubular section (62). A retractor 
(68) is slidably mounted to the outside of the tube (16). The 

retractor (68) confines the bead (38) such that when the 
retractor (68) slides along the outside of the tube (16), 

the bead (38) slides along the inside of the tube (16). The 
retractor (68) is provided with ribs (70-76) shaped such that 

the retractor (68) can be moved along the tube (16) in one 
direction only. When the needle (24) is retracted, its sharp 

tip (28) is aligned with the hard tubular section (62). The 
needle (24) is thus secured within the tubular section (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of vascular access catheters.
More specifically, it relates to a catheter introducer assembly having a special
mechanism for retracting the introducer needle and shielding the introducer needle
after introduction of the catheter into a blood vessel.Vascular access catheters are commonly used in the medical and surgical arts
for gaining access to the vascular system of a patient, for example, to infuse fluids
into a patient's blood vessel. Such devices are introduced into the blood vessel by
means of a sharp needle. The needle makes an initial opening in the vessel. Once
the needle has successfully penetrated the vessel, a catheter is threaded over the
needle and into the blood vessel. The needle is then withdrawn from the blood
vessel with the catheter remaining in the vessel.Since such a procedure necessarily involves contact between the needle and
the patient's blood, there is a risk that the needle will infect third parties if the
patient is infected with a blood borne disease such as AIDS or hepatitis. Since the
incidence of AIDS and hepatitis has increased in recent years, there has become an
increased awareness of the risks posed by catheter introducer needles. For this
reason, several attempts have been made to design catheter introducers which shield
catheter introducer needles.This invention relates to a particular class of catheter introducer, namely
introducers of the type
as defined in the preamble of claim 1
sold by Becton Dickinson and Company of Franklin Lakes,
New Jersey under the trademarks Angioset® and Intima™. Such catheter
introducers are described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,177,809 and 5,163,913.
The Angioset® and Intima™ devices comprise a 
catheter, a tube and a needle and stylet disposed in the
catheter and tube. Once the catheter has been introduced
into the blood vessel, the needle is withdrawn by pulling
the stylet. When the needle is fully withdrawn, the needle
and stylet can be disposed of. When such a procedure is
employed, the needle and stylet may be contaminated with
blood. There is therefore a need to provide a catheter
introducer of the Angioset® and Intima™ type which avoids
the risk of blood contamination by the needle and stylet.According to the present invention, said need is met
by a catheter introducer assembly comprising: a catheter
having a proximal end, a distal end and a lumen extending
there between; a flexible tube having a proximal end, a
distal end and a lumen extending there between, the lumen
of the tube being

<CLAIMS>
A catheter introducer assembly (10) comprising:

a catheter (12) having a proximal end (18), a distal
end (20) and a lumen (22) extending there between;
a flexible tube (16) having a proximal end, a distal
end (28) and a lumen (30) extending there between, the

lumen of the tube being in fluid communication with the
lumen of the catheter;
an introducer needle (24) having a proximal end (26)
and a distal end (28), the needle being axially disposable

in the catheter lumen;
an object (38) connected to the proximal end (26) of
the needle (24), the object (38) partially occluding the

lumen of the tube (16) and being slidable in the tube,
characterised in that said object (38) is a bead, such that

squeezing the tube (16) adjacent the object causes the
object to move axially in the lumen of the tube.
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 1,
further comprising a stylet (32) connecting the proximal

end (26) of the needle (24) to the bead (38).
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 1,
further comprising a retractor (68) slidably mounted on the

tube and mechanically linked to the bead (38), said
retractor being provided with means (70, 72, 74, 76) to

squeeze the tube (16) adjacent the bead (38) such that
sliding the retractor (68) axially along the tube causes

the bead to slide axially in the lumen of the tube.
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 3,
further comprising means (90, 92, 94, 96) for preventing

the retractor (68) from sliding in a distal direction.
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 1,
further comprising a shield for shielding the distal end

(28) of the needle (24), the shield being mounted on the
tube (16) proximate to the distal end of the tube.
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 3,
wherein the retractor comprises means for confining the

bead such that the bead moves axially along the lumen 
of the tube when the retractor moves axially along the

tube.
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 6,
wherein the means for confining comprise a plurality of

ribs (70, 72, 74, 76) for squeezing the tube (16).
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 7,
wherein the ribs have arcuate surfaces (80, 82, 84, 86)

facing in a proximal direction.
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 7,
wherein the ribs have angular surfaces (90, 92, 94, 96)

facing in a distal direction.
The catheter introducer assembly of claim 1,
wherein the bead (38) is provided with at least one groove

(39, 41, 43, 45) to facilitate fluid flow through the tube.
