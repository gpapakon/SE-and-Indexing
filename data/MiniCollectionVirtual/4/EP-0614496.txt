<DESCRIPTION>
 DIAMOND COATED PRODUCTS AND METHOD OF PREPARATIONGovernment Support This invention was made with government support under contract nos. ECD 8721545 and CDR 8721551 by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to diamond coated products and methods of preparation. It particularly concerns products in which a diamond coating is set in both a substrate and a binder. A preferred multistep process is provided which involves two stages of diamond film or coating growth, with an intermediate stage of binder or filler application.Background of the Invention Because of the various physical and chemical properties of diamond, diamond coatings have great potential for utilization in a wide variety of industries. In particular, diamond has a very high thermal conductivity and a very low electrical conductivity. It is very hard, inert and chemically resistant. Thus, it is a particularly effective protective coating for the wear or work surfaces of items such as cutting tools, drills or bearings; and, it is an effective protective coating for example for medical or surgical instruments or implants etc. InSpear, "Diamond-Ceramic Coating of the Future", Journal of the American Ceramics Society, Vol. 72, No. 2 (Feb. 1989), pages 184-187 incorporated herein by reference, desirable properties and applications of diamond coatings are described in considerable detail.Diamond coatings have been applied in a wide variety of manners. One of the older and best known methods of creating a diamond coating is through a sintered carbide process. While a great many variations 

 in such processing are known, a typical examples of such processing are provided in the descriptions in Levin, E, et al, "Solid State Bonding of Diamond to Nichrome and Co. - 20% wt W. Alloys", J. Mater. Sci. Lett.; Vol. 9 (1990) p. 726; and, Budinski, K.G., EngineeringMaterials, p. 128-132, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.In general, a carbide sintering process for preparation of diamond coating concerns provision of powdered carbide of appropriate size (typically about 1- 100 microns). The carbide is sintered with a binder onto a substrate under conditions of high pressure and temperature. Typically the binders are metal binders such as nickel or chromium. Typical substrates are steal, ceramics or similar materials. Typical conditions for application to the substrate are about 3.0 GPa pressure and 25° to 1,300°C.While such processes have been
