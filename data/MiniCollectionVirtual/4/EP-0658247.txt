<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for determining deviation of a volume of liquid from a predetermined volume comprises a main vessel (4) for receiving the liquid and a measuring vessel (5) from which the deviation is determined from the meniscus of the liquid in the measuring vessel (5). A communicating tube (49) extending from a neck (32) of the main vessel (4) communicates the main vessel (4) with the secondary vessel (5) through a ball valve (56). Liquid above a weir (55) in the neck (32) flows into the measuring vessel (5). The deviation of the liquid volume is read from a scale (26) adjacent the measuring vessel (5). A variable volume bladder (71) completely filled with liquid alcohol is mounted in the main vessel (4) for compensating for volume changes in the main vessel (4) due to temperature variations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for determining volume
of a liquid, and in particular though not limited to apparatus for
determining the deviation of a volume of liquid from a
predetermined volume.Apparatus for determining the deviation of a volume of liquid from
a predetermined volume is typically used for checking the
volumetric measuring accuracy of a dispensing and metering pump,
such as, for example, the metering pump of a petrol pump of the
type used in the forecourt of a service station. Such apparatus,
in general, comprises one or more vessels of known volume. The
quantity of liquid whose deviation from a predetermined volume is
to be determined is delivered into one of the vessels. A suitable
scale is provided for enabling the deviation in the volume of the
liquid to be read. These known apparatus suffer from a number of
disadvantages. In order to achieve the relatively high degree of
accuracy required for determining the deviation of volume, known
apparatus tend to require a relatively high degree of operator
skill and have significant operational restrictions.Furthermore, in general, such apparatus are calibrated at a
predefined temperature, generally, 20°C. Where the apparatus is
used at a temperature other than 20°C during measuring of the
volume of the liquid, the resultant volumes or deviations from a
predetermined volume determined from the apparatus will be
incorrect. In general, three main factors influence the
temperature of the apparatus during measuring, firstly, the
temperature of the ambient surrounds of the apparatus, secondly,
and in many cases, more importantly, the temperature of the liquid
being measured, and thirdly, the thermal response time of the
apparatus. This thermal response time varies depending on the 
thermal conductivity of the material of the apparatus, in other
words, the rate at which heat is transferred through the
apparatus. For example, where the apparatus is to be used for
determining the deviation of a volume of petrol from a
predetermined volume, such apparatus, in general, are calibrated
at 20°C. It is quite common for the petrol to be at a temperature
anywhere from 5°C, and even lower to 20°C and even higher. Thus,
even where an apparatus is stored at a temperature of 20°C, on
coming into contact with the petrol, the temperature of the
apparatus will be reduced or increased depending on the
temperature of the petrol, and this will affect the volume of the
apparatus, and in turn the accuracy of the apparatus.Typical of such apparatus for
