<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for galvanically isolated transmission of DC and AC signals via two-wire lines, having a combination comprising an invertor, a coupling stage with galvanic isolation and a rectifier for unidirectional DC transmission and a transformer for unidirectional DC transmission and a transformer for AC transmission, the invertor being connected to a first pair of connecting terminals and the rectifier to a second pair of connecting terminals. In order to transmit DC signals unidirectionally and AC signals bidirectionally in a galvanically isolated manner via a joint two-wire line while maintaining a 0/4 ...20mA interface, it is proposed according to the invention,   that a first series inductance (141) is connected upstream of the invertor (11), that a second series inductance (142) is connected downstream of the rectifier (13), and that the first and the second series inductances (141, 142) are windings of the transformer (14) for AC transmission.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the galvanically isolated transmission of ac
signals and dc signals over two-wire lines, including a

combination consisting of an inverter, a coupling stage
providing galvanic isolation and a rectifier for conveying the

dc current in unidirectional manner and a transformer for
conveying the ac current, wherein the inverter is connected to

a first pair of connection terminals and the rectifier is
connected to a second pair of connection terminals,

characterised in that

a first series inductance (141) is connected to an input of the
inverter (11),
a second series inductance (142) is connected to an output of
the rectifier (13),
and the first and the second series inductances (141, 142) are
windings of the transformer (14) used for conveying ac current.
Arrangement in accordance with Claim 1,

characterised in that

like-poled winding terminations of the transformer (14) are
connected to like-poled connection terminals (111, 131 / 112,

132) of the first and second pairs of connection terminals
(111, 112 / 131, 132).
