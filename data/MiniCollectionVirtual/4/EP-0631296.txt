<ABSTRACT>
In a flat-type picture display apparatus having a 
back electrode (41), plural linear cathodes 

(42a,42b,42c,42d), an electron beam extraction electrode 
(43), a signal electrode (44), a focusing electrode (45), a 

pair of horizontal deflection electrodes (46) and a pair of 
vertical deflection electrodes (47) which are disposed in a 

space between a front glass plate (48) and a back glass plate 
(49), vertical deflection electrodes (47), horizontal 

deflection electrodes (46) and/or a focusing electrode (45) 
are/is provided to extend beyond the border line of the 

electron beam passing the area of a television picture screen 
(50) to produce same equipotential surface on each unit for 

one picture element in the television picture screen. 
The hooked-twig parts of the horizontal deflection electrodes (46) 

produce euqipotential lines with a uniform formation in the electron 
passing area E (see Fig.3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat-type 
picture display apparatus as a picture reproducer having a 
flat picture. Heretofore, a cathode-ray tube has mainly used 
as color television picture display apparatus. The 
cathode-ray tube has considerably large depth in 
comparison with size of its television picture screen 
face. Hence it has been impossible to make a flat-type 
picture display apparatus with such cathode-ray tube. 
Recently, picture display apparatus of various types, such 
as an EL(electroluminescence) display device, a plasma 
display device or a liquid crystal display device etc. 
have been developed to offer the flat-type picture display 
apparatus. However, none of them has been able to offer 
satisfactory performance, such as luminance, contrast, 
pixel number and color reproducibility. Then, a flat-type picture display apparatus 
having high quality performance has been developed by 
employing electron beams, and such flat-type picture 
display apparatus is disclosed in the gazette of the 
Japanese unexamined patent application No. Sho 62-288762 
(publication No. Tokkai Hei 1-130453) which was filed by  
 
the same assignee as the present invention. The gazette No. Tokkai Hei 1-130453 discloses 
that a television picture screen is divided horizontally 
and vertically into the matrix arrangement of plural small 
segments, and each of the small segments is scanned by 
deflecting one electron beam which is separated from the 
other electron beams. And, fluorescent dots of R(red), 
G(green) and B(blue) for one picture element in the small 
segment are shot in turn by the electron beam of which an 
amount of the irradiation is controlled by color picture 
signals. As a result, television moving pictures as a 
whole are reproduced on the television picture screen by 
arranging all small segments. FIG.8 is an exploded perspective view showing an 
internal conventional picture display apparatus. As shown 
in FIG.8, plural electrodes are stored in an inside space 
of an enclosure between a front glass plate 8 and a back 
glass plate 9 as an envelope of the flat-type picture 
display apparatus. The plural electrodes comprise a back 
electrode 1, linear cathodes 2a, 2b and 2c as electron 
beam sources, an electron beam extraction electrode 3, 
signal electrodes 4, a focusing electrode 5, horizontal 
deflection electrodes 6 and vertical deflection electrodes 
7. And, the inside space of the enclosure between the 
front glass plate 8 and the back glass plate 9 is 
evacuated.
