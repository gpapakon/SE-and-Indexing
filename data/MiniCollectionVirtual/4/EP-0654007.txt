<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to apparatus (1) for providing a flow path from a normally sealed container (2) for flowable product, such as wine (not shown) in the container, which may be a normally hermetically sealed bag (2), part of which is shown in the figures. The bag (2) has secured to part of its surface a gland or support part (3), the gland (3) being cylindrical and hollow and having two longitudinally spaced apart flanges (4 and 5), one (4) of which defines a seating or edge remote from the bag (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING A FLOWPATHThe invention relates to apparatus for providing a flow path, particularly between respective interiors of two members which are connected, or to be connected, with a flow path between them.It is often necessary to connect two members, for example a drinks holder of the kind in which a flexible reservoir or bag of, say, liquid is held in a box, and the reservoir and box is to be connected to a dosing device for a measured distribution of the liquid from the reservoir in say a drinks machine.Such boxes with reservoirs therein are replaceable and it is accordingly essential that the contents of the reservoir remain sealed until the box is mounted in a drinks machine ready to be dispensed.Until now, it has not proved possible readily to provide a sealed container which is also easily prepared for dispensing of its contents when connected with a dispensing or dosing device. Similar considerations apply to dispensing of powders, particles or granules held initially in a sealed bag prior to dispensing from a machine in which the bag itself in a box, is mounted.It is accordingly an object of the invention to seek to mitigate this disadvantage.According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided apparatus for providing a flow path from a normally sealed container for flowable product in the container, comprising a mounting part adapted for mounting on a support part of the container and a part, movable with respect to the mounting part, adapted to pierce the container and to open a flow path through the apparatus. 

The mounting part may comprise a bifurcated part, particularly a substantially horseshoe shaped part. This provides for ease of mounting.The horseshoe shaped part may have means complementary with the support part of the container in use. This again provides ease of use.The means may comprise a groove means and a spigot means of the horseshoe shaped part. This provides a positive sliding connection.The mounting part and movable part may be screw-engageable. This provides a positive action.The movable part may have an internal passage means with a projecting piercing tip part. This provides for one-stroke piercing.The passage means may have an entry adjacent the piercing tip. This provides for free flow of product.The entry may comprise two passage parts leading to the interior of the passage means. This provides for non-bridging of product on entry to the passage.There may be an external seal means for sealing on the support part in a fully pierced
