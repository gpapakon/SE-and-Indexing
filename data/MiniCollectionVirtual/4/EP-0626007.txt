<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a continuous membrane reactor for
the production of biotechnical products such as concentrated
solutions of anaerobic micro-organisms or facultative
anaerobic micro-organisms. Other biotechnical products can
also be produced in the apparatus, for instance protein
hydrolysates produced by means of continuous protein
aggregation.The first industrial fermenting processes which were
developed were based on the production of micro-organisms in
reactors (fermenters) and on the concentration of the
bacteria in separate concentration units. These first
processes were operated batchwise. A batchwise process of
this kind results in a low average volumetric productivity
(increase in micro-organism quantity in relation to volume
and time unit). In addition, due to the batchwise
production, the load on the concentration unit from the
micro-organism mass varied, so that this had to be
overdimensioned in relation to the micro-organism production
in the fermenter. The further development resulted in a
continuous cultivation of micro-organisms in the fermenters.
Volumetric productivity was thereby increased and the load
on the concentration unit was more even. Productivity is
dependent on the concentration of micro-organisms in the
fermenter. With anaerobic growth the micro-organism
concentration is limited through the inhibition of end
products from the metabolism. Maximum micro-organism
concentration is therefore limited by the growth of micro-organisms
when the growth medium is optimalised. It is
nevertheless possible to increase the micro-organism
concentration beyond this limitation by connecting the
fermenter to a concentration unit. In the concentration unit
the inhibiting metabolism components are removed from the
micro-organism mass. A portion of the produced micro-organism
mass is returned to the fermenter and an 
"artificially" strong concentration of micro-organism mass
is achieved in the fermenter. This is known technology and
is used both in the production of ethanol and in biological
purification of water.The known prior art documents EP-A-0 121 074, WO-A-85/00l83 and EP-A-0 224
800 all refer to continuous membrane reactors with filter units incorporated in the reactor
loop. None of them, however, discloses or even suggests the incorporation of a hydrocyclone
in the reactor loop. Further, the prior equipment includes the use of a fermenter vessel or
reactor, such as in EP-A-224 800, where the filtering apparatus is placed inside the bioreactor.The invention's contribution to the
