<ABSTRACT>
A device for transmitting a heating or cooling medium to a moving 
substrate 

which includes at least one continuous channel (36) traversing at least a 
major 

portion of the width of the moving substrate for converting a 
multidirectional 

flow of the heating or cooling medium into a unidirectional flow, a 
device (50) for 

removing and/or preventing the presence of foreign matter within the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a device for transmitting a heating
or cooling medium to a moving substrate and particularly to a device for
transmitting a cool vapour such as air within an impingement freezer for freezing
food in which frost buildup is substantially eliminated.Commercial ovens and freezers typically rely on the transmission of a heating or
cooling medium such as air to the food product by a large fan or blower. The
fan or blower is situated proximate to a conveyor which carries the food through
the heater or freezer for a time sufficient to heat or freeze the food product.The food product entering the oven or freezer has a boundary layer composed
primarily of stagnant air which insulates the food product from the surrounding
atmosphere. In order to effect proper cooking or freezing, the boundary layer
must be substantially reduced to expose the food product directly to the heating
or cooling medium.Conventional fans or blowers generate a multidirectional flow of the heating or
cooling vapour. Much of the vapour is scattered about the freezer and only a
portion of this scattered vapour reaches the food product. At least a significant
portion of the blown vapour, therefore, does not directly impinge on the food
product in a perpendicular direction. Under these conditions, the vapour which
does contact the food product often does not possess sufficient energy to
substantially reduce the boundary layer. This results in inefficient heating or
freezing or requires excessively long exposures of the food product to the
heating or freezing operation.Efforts have been made to reduce the amount of heating or cooling vapour
which is scattered about the freezer. This has been accomplished by employing
a device within the oven or freezer which transforms the multidirectional air flow
from the blower or fan into a unidirectional flow of air directly toward the food
product which has sufficient energy to reduce the boundary layer.For example, Donald P. Smith, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,884,213, 4,289,792 and 
4,338,911, disclose a cooking apparatus utilising a series of spaced apart discrete
jets of unidirectionally flowing air produced by appropriately spaced tubes.Donald P. Smith, U.S. Patent No. 4,479,776, discloses a heating/cooling apparatus
having a thermal treatment zone for supplying columnated jets of a gas to the
exterior surface of a food product moving relative thereto in combination with at least
one equilibration zone for promoting heat transfer into or out of the interior

<CLAIMS>
A device for heating or cooling a food product, comprising an entry port (6) for
receiving food products; conveyor means having a moving substrate (8) for

transporting the food products from the entry port (6) to an exit port (15);
means (22) for generating a multidirectional flow of a heating or cooling

medium; and a food treatment section traversed by the conveyor means, the
device having at least one continuous channel (36) traversing at least a major

portion of the width of the moving substrate (8), the or each channel (36) being in the shape of a parallelepiped and
having a first opening (38) for receiving the multidirectional flow of heating or

cooling medium and a second opening (40) for discharging the heating or
cooling medium in a unidirectional flow toward the moving substrate (8) to

heat or cool food product thereon, characterised in that
cleaning means (56, 60) are

provided which are adapted to clean the entire volume of the parallelepiped
shaped channel(s) during the heating or cooling operation of the device, the cleaning means (56, 60) being insertable into said

channel and movable along at least a portion of the length of the channel (36)
in a direction which traverses the width of the moving substrate (8) for

removing or preventing the presence of foreign matter within the channel (36).
A device as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that the height of the channel
(36) is at least twice the width of the channel (36).
A device claimed in any one of Claims 1 and 2 characterised in that the first
opening (38) is V-shaped.
A device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the
cleaning means further comprises at least one support member (52, 64)

extending substantially perpendicular to the channel (36) for supporting the
cleaning means (56, 60) within the channel, and means (54, 68) for moving

the at least one support member (52, 64) along the length of the channel (36). 
A device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 characterised by the
provision of a plurality of spaced apart channels (36) traversing a substantial

portion of the moving substrate (8), said cleaning means comprising at least
one rod (56, 60) extending into and substantially the entire height of each of

the channels (36) and being adapted to contact the walls (34) of the channels
