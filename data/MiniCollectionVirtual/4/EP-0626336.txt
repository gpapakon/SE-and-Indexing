<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for 
adjusting the inclination and direction 

of travel of a rail wheel (1) of a crane. 
The bearing surfaces (8a and 8b) guiding 

the eccentric bearing bushes (2a and 2b) 
are so placed that they have the same 

eccentricity relative to the centre line 
of the shaft (6) as the journal boxes 3a 

and 3b, and the eccentricity has to be so 
chosen that the desired direction adjustment 

can be accomplished with a sufficiently 
small angle of rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
A procedure for adjusting the inclination relative to the
vertical direction and the direction of travel of a rail
wheel of a crane.After the assembly welding work on a crane has been completed,
it is often necessary to correct the alignment of a
rail wheel. This need generally arises from deformations and
inaccuracies in the steel structures of the crane. As is
known e.g. from DE-U-77 12 358, each end of the shaft of the rail wheel is provided
with an eccentric bearing bush held by its outer surface in
the frame of the end carriage. By turning the eccentric
bearing bush, it is possible to change the direction of
travel of the rail wheel and its inclination relative to the
vertical direction. In the starting situation, both bearing
bushes lie with their eccentricity in the same direction,
generally straight upwards. Therefore, when the bearing bush
is rotated, the horizontal motion of the centre of the rail
wheel journal box (adjustment of the direction of travel) is
given by sin α x E, where α = angle of rotation and E = eccentricity.
The vertical motion of the centre of the journal
box is (1 - cos α) x E. When the angle of rotation is 20° or
less (the situation in practice), the horizontal motion of
the centre of the journal box is considerably larger than
the vertical motion, so the adjustment of the direction of
travel is relatively easy to carry out. After this, it is
often necessary to change the inclination as well by turning
the other eccentric bearing bush. This has a greater effect
on the direction of travel than on the inclination. Whereupon
you have to correct the direction of travel by turning
the first bearing bush, as explained above. These adjustments
have to be repeated several times. A further drawback
is that finding the position of the bearing bushes requires
considerable precision, experience and care. From DE-B-1 213 971 an assembly for adjusting the direction of
a rail wheel of a crane is known where the bearing bush on both
sides of the rail wheel is displaced by means of adjustment
screws. This requires a complicated construction. To provide a solution to the problems referred to above, a
new procedure for adjusting the direction of a rail wheel of 
a crane is presented as an invention. The procedure of the
invention for adjusting the direction of a rail wheel of a
crane is characterized by what is presented in the characterization
part of claim 1. Other embodiments of the invention
are characterized by the features presented in the
other claims. In the solution of the
