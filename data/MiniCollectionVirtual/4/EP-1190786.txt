<ABSTRACT>
The hydroforming procedure, in which a sheet metal blank (1) is shaped against the surface of a die (5') by fluid forced into a matrix cavity (3'), is carried out with a clearance (j) between teh blank holder (2') and the die held at a value preventing the formation of a crease between the die and matrix (4'). The size of the clearance is determined by the pressure of the fluid in the matrix cavity and theeposition of the die relative to the matrix.

A method of hydroforming plates, in which a blank (1) is
fixed by means of a blank holder (2', 2'', 2''') to a die (4')

provided with a cavity (3') with a view to pressing said blank
(1) by means of a punch (5', 5'', 5''') entering the die,


characterised in that
, during the pressing phase, the clearance
between the punch (5', 5", 5''') and the blank holder (2',

2'', 2''') is modified in order to contain it within a range of
values preventing the formation of a fold between said punch.

and die, according to one or other or both of the following
parameters: pressure of the fluid in the cavity (3') of the die

(4') and position of the punch (5', 5'', 5''') with respect to
the die.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
clearance between punch (5', 5'', 5''') and blank holder (2',

2'', 2''') is controlled by modulating the geometry of the
facing parts of said punch and said blank holder during

pressing.
A method according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 said
modulation is carried out during the initial pressing phase and

is followed by the establishment of a permanent minimum
clearance (j).
A method according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that

said modulation consists of providing with a variable-geometry
part (2'b, 7, 14) only one of the two elements: punch (5', 5'',

5''') and blank holder (2', 2'', 2''').
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the back pressure prevailing in the cavity (3') is
modulated by means of a pressurised fluid.
A device for implementing the method according to any one
of claims 1 to 5, comprising a die (4') with a cavity (3') able

to receive a punch (5', 5'', 5''') for pressing a metallic
blank (1) fixed to the die by means of a blank holder (2', 2'',

2'''), 
characterised in that
 it comprises means (2'b, 7, 14)
for modifying the clearance between punch and blank holder

during the pressing operation.
A device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
said means are formed of a part (2'b) of the blank holder (2')

which can be moved by appropriate means (6) appropriate for
moving closer to or further away from the punch (5'), a part

(1c) of the blank (1) being able to bear against said movable
part (2'b) of the blank holder during pressing.
A device according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 said
means (6) for moving the movable part (2'b) of the blank holder

are slaved to the travel of the punch (5').
A device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 said
means are formed of a set of retractable cams (7) articulated

on the punch (5'') and whose movement is controlled according
to the travel of said punch, said cams constituting a

supporting and forming surface for the blank (1).
A device according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
cams (7) are controlled by a slide (9) driven simultaneously

with the punch (5'') and whose movement is itself controlled by
sliding on an inclined face (11) of the blank holder (2''). 
A device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 said
means are formed of a retractable bladder (14) housed in the

punch (5''') and connected to a source of fluid at adjustable
pressure, said bladder constituting a supporting and forming

surface for the blank (1).
A device according to claim 11, 
characterised in that
 the
pressure of fluid in said source is slaved to the travel of the

punch (5''').
