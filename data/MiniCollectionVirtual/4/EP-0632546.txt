<ABSTRACT>
A conductive spring device (46, Fig. 8) is described, which shorts a pair of connector 
terminals (14, 16) when the connector (12) is not mated to a second connector device 

(18). The spring device (46) is of the type having a fixed anchor end (50) connected to 
a first terminal (14) and an opposite contacting end portion (44) which can pivot in a 

shorting direction (S) to move outwardly (O) and also sidewardly (A) against the second 
terminal (16), and which can be forced to pivot in an unshorting direction (U) to move 

inwardly (I) and sidewardly away (B) from the second terminal (16). An isolator (92) of in 
sulative material surrounds an inner portion of the second terminal (16), so when the 

contacting end portion (44) is in its unshorting position, it cannot move sidewardly against 
the second terminal (16). The spring device (46) is formed of a piece of sheet metal with 

its anchor end (50) having a hole that closely receives the first terminal (14), the spring 
device (46) also having a tab (100) which projects inwardly into a slot (102) in the 

insulative base (28) of the connector (12) to limit pivoting of the spring device (46) about 
the first terminal (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
An automobile air bag can be deployed by an initiator that is constantly connected to a
voltage source, but with the initiator terminals constantly shorted by a sensor. When the
sensor detects a collision, its shorting switch opens and allows current to pass through
the initiator to deploy the air bag. During vehicle maintenance, a repairman may wish to
disconnect the collision sensor from the initiator. In the past, disconnection would lead
to firing of the initiator and deployment of the air bag. Accordingly, many prior air bag
systems have been constructed to prevent repairmen from disconnecting the connector
from the initiator, which hampers repairmen.The connector can be made disconnectable from the initiator, by providing a shorting
device that automatically shorts the terminals of the initiator when the connector is disconnected
from the initiator. Such automatic shorting devices are known, with U.S.
Patent 4,971,568 by Cronin showing one example, wherein a leaf spring pivots up and
against a terminal to ground it, until a mating connector pushes down the leaf spring.US Patent 4,628,818 showing another example, having a leaf spring with a bent back
leaf spring portion which pivots downwardly to interrupt the contact between the terminals
when mated with the corresponding connector.However, in a critical application such as an air bag system, any shorting device must
have great reliability, especially in assuring that it does not inadvertently short the terminals
when the sensor connector has been connected to the initiator. Such inadvertent
shorting would result in the air bag not deploying in the event of a crash. A shorting
device which was of high reliability, especially in assuring that a pair of terminals are not
shorted when two connectors mate, would be of considerable value.In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a connector system and
connector is provided which includes a shorting spring device that shorts a pair of connector 
terminals, and that is reliably moved to a position where it does not short the terminals
when the connector mates with another connector. The spring device has an anchor end
permanently connected to the first terminal, and has a contacting end portion which pivots
In shorting and unshorting directions against and away from the second terminal.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, to prevent accidental shorting when the
connectors are mated and the contact end portion has been moved inwardly to Its
unshorting position, an isolator of
