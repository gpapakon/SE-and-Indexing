<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a motor-vehicle component of the rear-shelf kind, and to its method of manufacture, having a substantially plane face and a reinforcement in the latter. The shelf is produced in a single step, by pressing, in a cold mould (10, 20), using a pressure of between 10 and 30 bar, a stack consisting of a first skin (5) made of stampable reinforced thermoplastic, of a cellular core (3) made of thermoplastic, of a second skin (4) made of stampable reinforced thermoplastic, and of an outer coating layer (6) made of a woven or nonwoven material, the said skins being heated beforehand outside the mould to a softening temperature.

Method for making a rear shelf or any similar
part of a motor vehicle, having a substantially flat

upper surface with a recess which includes a flat bottom
recessed with respect to said upper surface bordered by

connecting uprights between said bottom and said upper
surface, said recess giving the structure rigidity,

characterised in that the shelf (1) is made in a single
stage, by pressing in a cold mould, at a pressure in

the range 10 bars to 30 bars, a stack consisting of at
least a first skin layer (5) of stampable reinforced

thermoplastics material, a cellular core (3) of
thermoplastics material, a second skin layer (4) of

stampable reinforced thermoplastics material, the axis of
the cells of said cellular core being generally oriented

perpendicular to the skin layers, and an outer coating
layer (6) of woven or non-woven material, said skin

layers being previously heated outside the mould to a
softening temperature.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that said stack also comprises a second outer coating

layer (7) of woven or non-woven material, placed in the
mould on the opposite side to said first layer.
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that the cellular core (3) is placed in

the mould at ambient temperature.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the cellular core (3) has a beehive

structure.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the cellular core (3), the skin

layers (4, 5) and the outer coating layers (5, 6) are
made mainly of polyolefin, preferably polypropylene.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the stack, except for the first

outer coating layer (6) rests on a lower matrix (10) of
the mould having a hollow (11), the first outer coating

layer (6) being supported by a frame (22) carried by an
upper matrix of the mould, under a protruding member (21)

of the mould designed to engage in said hollow (11)
during the pressing stage.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that said skin layers are preheated to a

softening temperature in the range 160°C to 200°C before
they are introduced into the mould.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the mould is maintained at a

temperature close to 10°C.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that said pressure is in the range

15 bars to 20 bars.
Rear shelf or similar part of a motor vehicle
having a substantially flat upper surface with a recess

which includes a flat bottom recessed with respect to
said upper surface and connecting uprights between said

bottom and said upper surface, said recess giving the
structure rigidity, characterised in that it includes a

cellular core (3) of thermoplastics material, two skin
layers (4, 5) of stampable reinforced thermoplastics

material, covering the core on its two main sides, the
axis of the cells being generally oriented perpendicular

to the skin layers, and at least one outer coating layer
(6) of woven or non-woven material, the shape of the

shelf being obtained from a single pressing stage.
Rear shelf according to claim 10,
characterised in that the recesss has a depth greater

than or equal to 15 mm, preferably close to 20 mm.
