for receiving and/or transmitting optical data signals, optic 

means for being optically coupled to the optoelectronic 
assembly, and an optical fiber coupling device for coupling 

the optic means and at least one of the optoelectronic devices

a housing for being positioned adjacent the assembly relative 
to the optoelectronic device and, significantly, latching 

means movably positioned within the housing for initially 
engaging the optoelectronic device and thereafter for engaging 

the incoming optic means (e.g., optical fiber connector) when

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical fiber coupling devices for
use with optoelectronic assemblies and associated components,
such as duplex optical fiber connectors, which in turn may
form part of an optoelectronic system of an information
handling system (computer) or the like.In EP-A-0 567 809, entitled "Optical Fiber Duplex Connector
Assembly" (C.F. Baldwin et al), filed April 27, 1992, there is
defined an optical fiber connector wherein two individual
connectors (such as those of the SC variety as mentioned
below) are housed in movable orientation. The optical fiber
coupling device as defined in the present application is
adapted for receiving therein this connector as well as others
known in the art.As is known, the use of optical fiber as a transmission media
is growing at an accelerating rate, including within the
information handling system (computer) industry. The
advantages of optical fibers over other forms of transmission
media are well known. The potential bandwidth (or message
carrying capacity) of optical fibers is extremely high.
Systems using optical fibers are resistant to electro-magnetic
interference which sometimes plagues systems having electrical
cables. In addition, optical fiber cabling offers a higher
degree of data security than such electrical cables, as it is
more difficult for unauthorized personnel to tap or access an
optical fiber cable without being detected. Optical fiber devices use single or multiple strands of fibers
each having an inner circular glass core coated with an
circumferential cladding having a different index of
refraction. Light is transmitted along the core and totally
reflected from the interface between the core and cladding.
Such devices can be used as transmission lines for
transmitting and/or receiving, information
bearing light energy.Typically, transmission lines terminate in optical fiber
connectors, such as those referred to in the industry as SC
connectors, each of which include as part thereof an outer
housing wherein there is positioned the terminating end of the
optical fiber. This terminating end is fixed within a
ferrule, typically of ceramic material, the ferrule being
resiliently oriented such that is can be slightly compressed
when the connector is located within a receiving module
assembly or the like. Such connectors are illustrated and
described in US-A-4,953,929,
and in the aforementioned copending
EP-A-0 567 809, both of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Attention is also particularly directed to
