<ABSTRACT>
A partial regenerative dual fluid cycle gas turbine assembly 
which can reduce the amount of steam injected to the combustor 

and can reduce the pressure loss in the heat exchanger and in pipes 
around the heat exchanger, thereby improving the efficiency of the 

gas turbine. The partial regenerative dual fluid cycle gas turbine 
assembly has a gas turbine unit including a compressor (1) for 

compressing air, a combustor (2) for burning fuel, and a turbine (3), 
driven 

by the combustion gas, for driving the compressor (1). A steam-driven 
mixer (10) boosts the air and mixes the steam and the air. A heat 

exchanger (12) is arranged downstream of the turbine (3) for heating the 
mixed gas from the mixer (10) with heat from the turbine exhaust gas. 

A heat recovery steam generator (4) is arranged downstream of the 
heat exchanger (12) for producing steam with heat from the exhaust 

gas. An air line (20) is provided for introducing a first portion of the 
compressed air from the compressor (1) to the combustor (2) and for 

introducing a second portion of the compressed air to the mixer (10). A 
main steam line (22) is provided for introducing a portion of the steam 

from the heat recovery steam generator (4) to the mixer (10). A mixed gas 
line (24) is provided for introducing the mixed gas from the mixer (10) 

to 
the combustor (2) via the heat exchanger (12). The mixer (10) can 

include either 
a steam turbine-driven compressor or an ejector. A second portion 

of the steam (26) produced by the heat recovery steam generator (4) 
can be segregated for use by external utilities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a partial regenerative dual 
fluid cycle gas turbine assembly comprising: 
a gas turbine unit including a compressor for producing 
compressed air, a combustor for burning fuel to produce 
combustion gas, and a turbine driven by the combustion gas 
and producing exhaust gas, wherein the turbine is 
operatively connected to drive the compressor; a steam-driven mixer for pressurising air and mixing steam 
with air to produce a mixed gas;  a heat recovery steam generator for producing steam with 
heat from the exhaust gas; air line means for introducing the compressed air from 
compressor to the mixer and to the combustor; a main steam line for introducing a first portion of the 
steam produced by the heat recovery steam generator to the 
mixer; and a mixed gas line for introducing the mixed gas 
from the mixer to the combustor. Such a partial regenerative dual fluid cycle gas turbine 
assembly is known for example from FR-A-1 168 070.  
 Another dual fluid cycle gas turbine assembly of the prior art 
is shown in FIG. 8 wherein air "A" sucked into a compressor 1 is 
compressed therein and flows into a combustor 2. The compressed 
air burns fuel "F" and forms a combustion gas of high temperature. 
The combustion gas flows in to a turbine 3, performs work therein, 
and the resulting exhaust gas "E" is exhausted to the atmosphere 
after having generated steam "S" in a heat recovery steam 
generator 4. The steam "S" is injected into the combustor 2, which 
increases both the flow rate and the specific heat of the 
combustion gas flowing into turbine 3, and thus increases the 
power of turbine 3. The power generated by turbine 3 drives both 
compressor 1 and a generator 5 to generate electric power. Water 
is fed by a pump 11 to an economizer 6, before being fed to heat 
recovery steam generator 4. A stack 9 is arranged downstream of 
heat recovery steam generator 4. There are problems, however, with the prior art dual 
fluid cycle gas turbine of FIG. 8. Because the amount of steam 
injected may be up to 20 - 30% of the amount of air, if the 
injection of the steam is stopped, the flow rate into the turbine is 
excessively reduced and the thermal efficiency of the turbine is 
greatly reduced. Another problem is that, since the injected steam 
is exhausted to the atmosphere together with the exhaust gas, the 
more steam is injected, the more water is required to generate 
steam, and thus the greater the operating cost. A prior art regenerative dual fluid cycle gas turbine
