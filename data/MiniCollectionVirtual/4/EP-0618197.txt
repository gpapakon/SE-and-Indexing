<DESCRIPTION>
The role of excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as 
glutamic acid and aspartic acid, as the predominant 
mediators of excitatory synaptic transmission in the 
central nervous system has been well established. Watkins 
& Evans, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.,21, 165 (1981); 
Monaghan, Bridges, and Cotman, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol.Toxicol.,29, 365 (1989); Watkins, Krogsgaard-Larsen, and 
Honore, Trans. Pharm. Sci.,11, 25 (1990). These amino 
acids function in synaptic transmission primarily through 
excitatory amino acid receptors. The excitatory amino 
acids also participate in a variety of other physiological 
processes such as motor control, respiration, 
cardiovascular regulation, sensory perception, and 
cognition. Excitatory amino acid receptors are classified into 
two general types. Receptors that are directly coupled to 
the opening of cation channels in the cell membrane of the 
neurons are termed "ionotropic." This type of receptor has 
been subdivided into at least three subtypes, which are 
defined by the depolarizing actions of the selective 
agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- 
methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainic acid 
(KA). The second general type of receptor is the G-protein 
or second messenger-linked "metabotropic" excitatory amino 
acid receptor. This second type, when activated by the 
agonists quisqualate, ibotenate, or trans-1- 
aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, leads to enhanced 
phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the postsynaptic cell. Both 
types of receptors appear not only to mediate normal 
synaptic transmission along excitatory pathways, but also  
 
participate in the modification of synaptic connections 
during development. These receptors also affect changes in 
the efficiency of synaptic transmission throughout life. 
Schoepp, Bockaert, and Sladeczek, Trends in Pharmacol.Sci.,11, 508 (1990); McDonald and Johnson, Brain ResearchReviews,15, 41 (1990). The excessive or inappropriate stimulation of 
excitatory amino acid receptors leads to neuronal cell 
damage or loss by way of a mechanism known as 
excitotoxicity. Excitatory amino acid excitotoxicity has 
been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of 
neurological disorders. This excitotoxicity has been 
implicated in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic 
neurodegenerative conditions including cerebral deficits 
subsequent to cardiac bypass surgery and grafting, stroke, 
cerebral ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head trauma, 
Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Chorea, amyotrophic
