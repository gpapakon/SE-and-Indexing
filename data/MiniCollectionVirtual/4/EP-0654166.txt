<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a DRAM cell assembly in which two memory cells, which include a MOS transistor and a memory element, are each designed as a pair of transistors (10) whose source regions are connected to each other and to a bit line (11). The drain, gate electrode and source of the MOS transistors are disposed in a straight line which is aligned in the same direction as the bit lines (11) and which is disposed essentially below one bit line (11). Adjacent to each drain region is a connection zone (13) which is located beside associated bit lines (11) and by means of which a cell contact is established to the memory element. The cell assembly is particularly suitable for buried-bitline stacked-capacitor (BBSTC) DRAM cells.

in which bitlines (11) are arranged in a bitline 
plane and word lines (12) are arranged in a wordline 

plane,
