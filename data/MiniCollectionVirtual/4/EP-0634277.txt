<ABSTRACT>
A cutting mechanism for printing tape is described wherein the 
tape is bent over an arcuate surface during cutting so that 

when the tape is cut layers of the tape secured to one another 
by an adhesive layer tend to separate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tape cutting apparatus and is 
particularly but not exclusively concerned with cutting tape 
used in thermal printing devices. Thermal printing devices of the type with which the present 
invention is primarily concerned operate with a supply of tape 
arranged to receive an image and a means for transferring 
image onto the tape. In one form, a tape holding case holds a 
supply of image receiving tape and a supply of an image 
transfer ribbon, the image receiving tape and the transfer 
ribbon being passed in overlap through a printing zone of the 
printing device. A printing device operating with a tape 
holding case of this type is described for example in 
EP-A-0267890 (Varitronics, Inc.). Other printing devices have 
been made in which letters are transferred to an image 
receiving tape by a dry lettering or dry film impression 
process. In all of these printing devices, the construction 
of the image receiving tape is substantially the same. That 
is, it comprises an upper layer for receiving an image which 
is secured to a releaseable backing layer by a layer of 
adhesive. Once an image or message has been printed on the 
tape, it is desired to cut off that portion of the tape to 
enable it to be used as a label. For this purpose, it is 
necessary to remove the releaseable backing layer from the 
upper layer to enable the upper layer to be secured to a 
surface by means of the adhesive layer. With existing 
printing devices, it is difficult to remove the releaseable 
backing layer from the upper layer: it is necessary first to 
separate the closely adhered end portions of the releaseable 
backing layer and the upper layer, for example using a 
fingernail or tweezers so that the separated end portion of 
the releaseable backing layer can be finger gripped to peel it 
off the adhesive layer. This is a relatively difficult 
procedure and furthermore can result in the ends of the label 
being damaged in the process.  
 There have been several attempts to solve this problem. Most 
such attempts have sought to rely on the provision of a 
so-called tab cut. In these devices, a first cut is made 
completely through all the layers of the tape to cut off a 
portion of the tape and at the same time a cut is made through 
only one layer of the tape. This provides a "tab" which, in 
theory, can be peeled away reasonably easily. While a tab cut 
has been implemented successfully with relatively thick, stiff 
upper layers there are significant difficulties in 
implementing

<CLAIMS>
A tape cutting apparatus for cutting off a portion of 
tape comprising first and second layers (4a, 4b) secured one to another 

by an adhesive layer, the apparatus comprising a cutter 
support member (38, 38') carrying a blade (40) and being mounted for movement 

relative to an arcuate tape support surface (32, 32') over which the 
tape extends during cutting so that when the tape is cut the 

first and second layers (4a, 4b) tend to separate from one another at 
the cut edge. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the arcuate 
support surface is provided by a semi-circular mandrel (32). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 which further 
comprises a clamp (36) arranged to pull the tape downwards over the 

arcuate support surface and hold it in place during cutting. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein the 
arcuate support surface includes a slot (34) into which the blade 

moves during cutting. 
A tape holding case holding a supply of tape comprising 
first and second layers (4a, 4b) secured one to another by an adhesive 

layer, the tape holding case (1) being adapted to cooperate with a 
cutting blade (40) and comprising an arcuate tape support surface (32, 32') 

over which the tape extends during cutting so that when the 
tape is cut the first and second layers (4a, 4b) tend to separate from 

one another at the cut edge. 
A printing device having a cassette (1) receiving bay for 
receiving a cassette holding tape comprising first and second 

layers (4a, 4b) secured one to another by an adhesive layer, a printing 
mechanism for printing on said tape and a cutter support 

member (38, 38') carrying a blade (40) for cutting said tape, the printing 
device further comprising an arcuate tape support surface (32, 32') over 

which the tape extends during cutting so that when the tape is 
cut the first and second layers (4a, 4b) tend to separate from one 

another at the cut edge.
