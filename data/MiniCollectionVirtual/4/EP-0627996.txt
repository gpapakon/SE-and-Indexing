<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automotive vehicle seat systems
and, more particularly, to lightweight, high strength,
economical frames and recliners employed in such systems (see, for
example, FR-A-2 121 280, on which the pre-characterising portions
of claims 1 and 23 are based.)The present invention relates to the inventions of U.S. Patent
No. 5,213,300 on May 25, 1993 entitled "Extruded Automotive Seat
Track", as well as the U.S. Patent No.5,338,100 on August 16,
1994 entitled "High Strength Automotive Seat Frame and Method",
the latter corresponding to EP-A-0 627 997.Automotive seating systems are typically designed as part of a
host vehicle occupant's protection or safety system.
Accordingly, various requirements are imposed on such seating
systems. They must have high strength and structural integrity
so that the seat remains anchored to the vehicle in the event of
a crash, i.e., the seat tracks should not separate from the
vehicle, from each other or from the seat. Furthermore, the seat
back should either remain in its pre-crash set position, or
under certain conditions collapse in a predictable, energy
absorbing manner. Test results embodied in U.S. Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standards 208 and 210 require that the seat belts
and their anchorages withstand loads of 1500 to 3000 pounds
(approx. 680 to 1360 kg) without failure. If any anchorage
is mounted to the seat structure, the structure must withstand
such loads as well. The outboard (adjacent the door) upper and
lower seat belts and anchorages should withstand the load of
1500 pounds (approx. 680 kg) and the inboard (adjacent the
center line) lower part should withstand 3000 pounds (approx.
1360 kg). In addition, increased emphasis on fuel economy
necessitates vehicle weight reduction. This, of course, makes it
highly desirable to reduce the weight of the seating system, but
mere weight reduction can adversely impact the strength of the
seating system. Cost containment is still another requirement imposed upon
automotive vehicle seating systems and prior art attempts to
meet all three requirements, high strength - lightweight - low
cost, have not been satisfactory. Some attempts have been made
to substitute aluminium for steel in the design of seat frame
assemblies.These designs typically required steel reinforcements
to provide the necessary structural strength and such
reinforcements add weight, prackage size and cost to the
systems.
Another desirable advantage of automotive seating systems is the
intragration of the seat restraints or
