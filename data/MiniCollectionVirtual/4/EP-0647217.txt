<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel fungicidal acylaminobenzenes, to processes for 
preparing them, to fungicidal compositions containing them and to methods of using them to 
combat fungi, especially fungal infections of plants. Fungicidal acylaminobenzamides are disclosed in EP-A1-038 1330, EP-A1-0468682, 
EP-A1-0468683 and EP-A1-0470711, whilst benzohydroxamic acid derivatives are disclosed 
in GB-A-274282. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula (Ia), 
wherein R' is C1-4 alkyl; and R" is C1-4 alkoxy. Alkyl groups, and the alkyl moiety of alkoxy, of R' and R" are straight or branched 
chains and are, for example, methyl, ethyl or n- or iso-propyl. The invention is illustrated by the compounds listed in Table I which follows. The 
compounds have the formula (Ia) in which the values R' and R" are as listed. 
Compound No. R' R" mpt °C 1CH3OC2H5120-5 2C2H5OCH382.5-84 3CH3OCH3101-104 4C2H5OC2H55CH3CH2CH2OCH36CH3CH2CH2OC2H57(CH3)2CHOCH38(CH3)2CHOC2H5The compounds of formula (Ia) can be made by, for example, the methods illustrated 
in Schemes 1 and 2. Throughout these Schemes R' and R" are as hereinbefore defined. 
In Scheme 1 compounds of formula (Ia) can be prepared by reacting compounds of formula 
(VI) with 2-fluoro-iso-butyryl chloride (F(CH3)2CCOCl) in a suitable organic solvent such as 
methylene chloride or toluene in the presence of a base such as an amine (for example 
triethylamine or pyridine) or an alkali metal carbonate, bicarbonate or hydroxide (for example 
sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide). Alternatively, compounds of formula (Ia) can be prepared by reacting compounds of 
formula (VI) with 2-fluoro-iso-butyric acid (F(CH3)2CCO2H) in a suitable organic solvent 
such as dichloromethane or toluene in the presence of a suitable coupling agent (for example a 
carbodiimide salt such as dimethylaminopropyl ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride). Compounds of formula (VI) may be prepared from compounds of formula (XIII), 
wherein R is lower alkyl (either straight or branched chain) by treatment with an acid (for  
 
example aqueous hydrogen chloride, aqueous hydrogen bromide or trifluoroacetic acid) 
optionally in a solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran. Compounds of formula (XIII) may be prepared from acids of formula (XII) by 
reaction with a secondary amine HNR'R" in the presence of a coupling reagent (for example a 
carbodiimide salt such as dimethylaminopropyl ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride). A suitable 
organic solvent may be used such as
