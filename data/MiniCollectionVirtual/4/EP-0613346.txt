<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power column,
and more particularly, the invention relates to a
pivotable power column .A power column generally is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,523,683
(the source of the preamble of Claim 1)
and is fixedly mounted
between floor and ceiling of a hospital room. The
column is of rectangular cross section. A bed is
positioned with its head end adjacent to the power
column and with the bed being positioned at the angle
with respect to the power column that is most convenient
for the attending nurse and for providing physiological
services for the patient. The power column
has mounted in its front face plural gas outlets, that
is, outlets for oxygen, purified air, nitrous oxide
and vacuum. Alongside walls of the power column are
electrical outlets. There is provision for normal 110
volt power, emergency power, low voltage communication
circuits and low voltage monitoring circuits. A 
monitor with visual display is mounted on an arm at
the front wall of the power column, the arm permitting
the monitor to tilt and swivel. Vertical mounting
rails are provided to mount a wide variety of accessories
such as a sphygmomanometer, drainage bag, IV
pole, stat clock timer for code blue situations,
lamps, storage baskets, etc.The power column is for critical care
patients. The objective has been to make all of the
equipment associated with the treatment of the patient
as accessible as possible while providing as much
freedom of movement as possible around the bed so as
to permit the nurse to attend the patient, even in
code situations.U.S. Patent 4574963 describes a free-standing
island type power column which is generally rectangular in
cross-section with laterally extending front and rear base
sections services outlets for connection with fluid and
electrical conduits are provided on at least the front
side.U.S. Patent No. 5455975 describes mounting of a
power column for pivoting movement around the head end
of the bed. More specifically, there are disclosed
support arms pivoted to the floor and ceiling, respectively,
on an axis that passes through the head end of
the bed. The power column is mounted between the free
ends of those arms, thereby permitting the power 
column to be swung to either corner at the head end of
the bed so as to be positionable on either the right
or left side of the bed. The pivoting power column
increases the flexibility of bringing services to the
patient on the side of the patient where they are
needed or, alternatively, making the equipment 
optimally

<CLAIMS>
A power column (15) comprising a hollow, vertical
housing having a plurality of vertical walls (21-26), means

(16, 17) supporting the housing, the vertical walls
including a front wall (21) having two vertical edges,

opposed side walls (24, 25) and a back wall (26) connected
to the side walls (24, 25), and a plurality of electrical

outlets (27, 28, 29) on at least one of the vertical walls,
characterised in that the power column (15) is adapted to

be arcuately moved from one side of a hospital bed (20)
around its end (19) to the other side of the bed, the

support means (16, 17) permitting the housing to be
arcuately moved from one side of the bed (20) past one end

(19) of the bed to the other side of the bed, in that the
vertical walls include an outlet wall (22, 23) extending

from each vertical edge of the front wall (21) at an angle
of about 45° to the plane of the front wall, the side walls

(24, 25) being connected to the outlet walls (22, 23), and
in that the outlets (27, 28, 29) are on the outlet walls

(22, 23), whereby, when the column (15) is arcuately moved
to either side of the bed (20), an outlet wall (22, 23)

will be disposed substantially perpendicular to the side of
the bed and thus optimally accessible to an attending

nurse.
A power column as claimed in Claim 1, further
comprising means on at least one wall (24, 25) for

pivotally mounting at least one horizontal gas rail (40),
at least one gas outlet (45) mounted on the gas rail (40),

and means (63, 66) for connecting the gas outlet to a gas
supply whereby the gas rail (40) can be pivoted with

respect to the power column to permit optimal positioning
of gas outlet(s) (45).
A power column as claimed in Claim 2, further
comprising means for adjusting the height of the gas rail 

(40) with respect to the power column.
A power column as claimed in either Claim 2 or
Claim 3 further comprising a plurality of vertical gas

supply tubes (71-74) in the power column, the outlet (45)
being connected to one of the vertical gas supply tubes

(71-74).
A power column as claimed in Claim 4, wherein gas
supply tubes (71-74) on each side of the power column are

combined as a single extrusion (75, 76) having two tubes
side-by-side, and wherein the column further comprises a

common vertical rib (78) joining the tubes and forming an
integral part of the extrusion (75, 76), a plurality of

vertically-spaced bores (79, 80) through the rib (78)
alternatingly-connected to each tube (71-74), and

horizontal tubes (81) connected to each bore (79, 80), each
horizontal tube (81) having at least one gas hook-up outlet

(66).
A power column as claimed in Claim 5, further
comprising a plurality of hook-up outlets (66) mounted on

each horizontal tube (81) and projecting through a wall
(26) of the power column.
A power column as claimed in any preceding Claim,
further comprising at least one vertical rail (30, 31, 38)
