<CLAIMS>
A device for the regeneration and conveyance of positive or 
negative thermal energy, permitting the immediate cooling recharge of 

an exchange element (13) intended to refrigerate a container or mobile 

carriage (14) during its transport,
 
   characterised in that it includes at least one permanent 

refrigerated store (1, 2) of anti-freeze fluid (3) which, coupled to a system 
of outflow (7, 8) arid return (9, 10) tubes, permits the direct recharging 

with refrigerated fluid of the exchange element (13) of the container (14), 
and another store (2, 1), also coupled to the tuber system (7, 10), which 

permits the recovery of the return fluid, having lost its negative thermal 
energy and leaving the exchange element (13), to be refrigerated again, 

and coils (4) permanently installed in each of the stores (1, 2) and 
permanently refrigerated by means of a cold compressor (5 and 6) for 

each of the stores in order to refrigerate the fluid present therein. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that each of the 
stores (1 and 2) functions alternately to permit either the refrigeration or 

the regeneration of the anti freeze fluid (3), the first, (1 or 2) serving to 
refrigerate the fluid (3) and recharge the exchange element (13) and the 

second (2 or 1) serving to recover the return fluid leaving the exchange 
element (13) to regenerate it in this second store in order that it can 

subsequently be sent back into the exchange element (13) of the or of 
another container (4), the first store then receiving the return fluid and so 

on.  
 
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
alternating use of the stores (1, 2) is controlled by a four-way valve (16) 

or by two two-way valves (24, 25) which may be manual or powered, 
which valves provide four paths (7, 8, 9, 10) or two paths (7, 10 and 8, 

9) in the tube system and permit the automatic sending of fluid (3) from 
one store to the exchange element (13), as well as the return of the fluid 

from this exchange element to the second store and vice versa. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
exchange element (13) includes baffles (15) for a better distribution and 

accumulation of the negative thermal energy of the fluid (3). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the container (14) contains a condensate outlet (22) 

as well as a system of tubes and nozzles (23) permitting its cleaning by 
the supply of water or steam.
