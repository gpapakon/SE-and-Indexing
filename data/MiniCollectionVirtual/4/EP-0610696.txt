<ABSTRACT>
The plate part (4) for formation of a hook section suspendable in the suspended rail (16) has an edge-open recess (20) in the direction of the bending edge (6). At least one of the two plate strips of the plate part (4) in the area of the recess (20) has an edging which increases the resistance to bending of the plate part (4). Each edging extends over the area of the hook section (18), and the plate part (4) comprises a plate material with a thickness of 0.2 mm to 0.3 mm, partic. approximately 0.25 mm.

<CLAIMS>
A hanging fitting (2) for filing devices (1), such as 
suspended folders, suspended files, suspended filing 

holders and the like, which are to be suspended in a 
hanging rail (16), comprising a strip-shaped sheet-metal 

part (4) with two sheet-metal strips (12, 14) 
which are bent over one another around approximately 

180° at a bending edge (6), are placed or may be 
placed on a marginal region (8) of the respective 

filing device (1) and are connected or may be connected 
to one another in particular by rivets (10), with 

the interposition of the material of the filing device 
(1), the sheet-metal part (4) having, for the formation 

of a hook portion (18) which may be suspended in 
the hanging rail (16), a cutout (20) which is open 

towards the margin in the direction of the bending 
edge (6), interrupting the latter,
characterized in that
, at least 
one of the two sheet-metal strips (12, 14) of the 

sheet-metal part (4) has in the region of the cutout 
(20) a beading (22, 24) which is formed by a marginal 

web, bent out of the plane of the respective sheet-metal 
strip (12 and/or 14) around approximately 90°, 

and increases the flexural strength of the sheet-metal 
part (4), the or each beading (22, 24) extending at 

least over a narrowed portion (28) of the sheet-metal 
part (4) formed by the cutout (20) interrupting the 

bending edge (6).  
 
A hanging fitting according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the or each 
beading (22, 24) extends at least over a region of the 

cutout (20) which is in the region of a half of the 
sheet-metal strips (12, 14) which is remote from the 

bending edge (6). 
A hanging fitting according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 the or each 
beading (22, 24) also extends over the region of the 

hook portion (18). 
A hanging fitting according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 3,
characterized in that
 both sheet-metal 
strips (12, 14) of the sheet-metal part (4) have 

beadings (22, 24) which overlap one another or abut 
against one another in the region of a centre plane of 

the sheet-metal part (4). 
A hanging fitting according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 4,
characterized in that
 the beading 
(22, 24) of the one sheet-metal strip (12/14) extends 

approximately into the plane of the other sheet-metal 
strip (14/12). 
A hanging fitting according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 5,
characterized in that
 the sheet-metal 
part (4) is of a sheet-metal material having a 

thickness of 0.2 mm to 0.3 mm, in particular approximately 
0.25 mm.
