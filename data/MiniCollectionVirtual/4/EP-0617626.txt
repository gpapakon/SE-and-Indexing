<ABSTRACT>
Proteins or peptidic substances, which may be prepared from naturally occurring proteins, enhance the bioavailability of proteolytically-labile therapeutic agents which, in the absence of the protein or peptidic substance would suffer enzymatic inactivation upon administration.

<DESCRIPTION>
SOYBEAN PROTEIN OR HYDROLYZATES IN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS TO PROTECT BIOACTIVE PEPTIDES FROM ENZYMATIC INACTIVATION.This invention relates to enhancing the bioavailability of proteolytically labile therapeutic agents by administering the therapeutic agent in combination with a protecting agent comprising a protein, a purified natural protein, a molecular weight fractionated protein, or a partially hydrolyzed protein.Background of the Invention Peptide drugs and drugs containing a peptidase labile bond are among the most promising medicinal agents of modern times, but their instability in the presence of proteolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract and other mucosal tissues usually requires that they be administered parenteraliy. Although patients can be taught to inject parenteraliy, there has been a long felt need to develop a non-invasive method for self administration of peptide drugs.Protease inhibitors and penetration enhancers are means often considered to circumvent the enzymatic and penetration barriers to peptide and protein absorption from mucosal routes of administration. Because of such barriers, the bioavailability of peptide and protein drugs from mucosal routes is poor.Non-parenteral administration of peptide drugs in particular often results in very low bioavailability because of hydrolysis of the peptides by proteolytic enzymes. For leuprolide, this ranges from 0.05% following oral administration to 38% following vaginal administration; for insulin, the corresponding figures are 0.05% and 18%. Lee, Journal of Controlled Release, 13, 213 (1990).Examples of proteolytic enzymes which inactivate proteolytically-labile therapeutic agents are pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase in the intestinal lumen, and the aminopeptidases located on the mucosal surfaces of the Gl tract, nose, and vagina.Transport of intact oligopeptides across adult mammalian jejunum has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo as well as in combination with peptidase inhibitors. Friedman and Amidon, Pharmaceutical Research 8, no. 1 , P. 93, (1991).Fujii et al; US 4,639,435 (1987) claims the use of 1-isopropyl-4-[4-(1 ,2,3,4- tetrahydronaphthoyloxy)benzoyl] piperazine methanesulfonate as an inhibitor of chymotrypsin to be co-dosed orally or rectally with a chymotrypsin-labile drug (kallikrein 

 or calcitonin). The reference also discloses the use of benzoylpiperazine esters for this purpose. The reference does not describe the mechanism of these inhibitors.Cho and Ffynn; International

Claims We claim:
1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a protecting agent and a biologically effective amount of a proteolytically-labile therapeutic agent, with the proviso that when said protecting agent is soy flour, said therapeutic agent may not be insulin.
2. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said protecting agent is selected from a protein, a peptide, a purified natural protein, a molecular weight fractionated protein, a solvent-extracted protein, or a partially hydrolyzed protein.
3. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said protecting agent is a partially hydrolyzed protein which has been hydrolyzed by enzymatic means.
4. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 3 wherein said enzymatic means is trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, carboxypeptidase, aminopeptidase, pepsin or collagenase.
5. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said protecting agent is a partially hydrolyzed, molecular weight-fractionated protein which has a molecular weight greater than 1000.
6. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said protecting agent is a partially hydrolyzed, molecular weight-fractionated protein which has a molecular weight range of 1000 to 30000. 7. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said protecting agent is soy flour, soy protein, wheat gluten, almond flour, peanut flour, casein or fish protein.
8. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said protecting agent is a protein or molecular weight-fractionated, partially hydrolyzed protein which is derived from naturally occurring protein. 9. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1 wherein said proteolytically- labile therapeutic agent is calcitonin, prolactin, adrenocorticotropin, thyrotropin, growth hormone, gonadotropic hormone, oxytocin, vasopressin, gastrin, tetragastrin, pentagastrin, glucagon, secretin, pancreozymin, substance P, gonadotropin, immunoglobulin, leuprolide, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, enkephalin, cholecystokinin, follicle stimulating hormone, interferon, interieukin, thymopentin, endothelin, neurotensin, insulin, insulinotropin, or terlakiren.
10. A method of enhancing bioavailability of a proteolytically-labile therapeutic agent comprising administering said therapeutic agent to a mammal in need 


 of said therapeutic agent in combination with a protecting agent in an amount sufficient to enhance the bioavailability of said therapeutic agent, with the proviso that when said protecting agent is soy flour said therapeutic agent may not be insulin.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein said protecting agent is selected from a protein, a peptide, a purified natural protein, a molecular weight-fractionated protein, a solvent-extracted protein, or a partially hydrolyzed protein.
