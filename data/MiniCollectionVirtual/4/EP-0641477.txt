<ABSTRACT>
A wideband assisted reverberation system has multiple microphones (M1-M3) to pick up reverberant sound in a room, multiple loudspeakers (L1-L3) to broadcast sound into the room, and a reverberation matrix connecting a similar bandwidth signal from the microphones (m) through reverberators to the loudspeakers (L). Preferably the reverberation matrix connects each microphone (m) through one or more reverberators to at least two loudspeakers (L) with cross-linking so that each loudspeaker (L) receives a signal comprising a sum of at least two reverberated microphone signals. Most preferably there is full cross-linking so that every microphone (m) through reverberators to every loudspeaker (L), so that each loudspeaker (L) receives a signal comprising a sum of reverberated microphone signals from every microphone (m).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to assisted reverberation systems. An
assisted reverberation systems is used to improve and control the
acoustics of a concert hall or auditorium.There are two fundamental types of assisted reverberation
systems. The first is the In-Line System, in which the direct
sound produced on stage by the performer(s) is picked up by one or
more directional microphones, processed by feeding it through
delays, filters and reverberators, and broadcast into the
auditorium from several loudspeakers which may be at the front of
the hall or distributed around the walls and ceiling. In an
In-Line system acoustic feedback (via the auditorium) between the
loudspeakers and microphones is not required for the system to work
(hence the term in-line).In-line systems minimise feedback between the
loudspeakers and microphones by placing the microphones as close
as practical to the performers, and by using microphones which have
directional responses (eg cardioid, hyper-cardioid and
supercardioid).There are several examples of in-line systems in use
today. The ERES (Early Reflected Energy System) product is 
designed to provide additional early reflections to a source by the
use of a digital processor - see J. Jaffe and P Scarborough;
"Electronic architecture: Towards a better understanding of theory
and practice" 93rd convention of the Audio Engineering Society,
1992, San Francisco (preprint 3382 (F-5)). The design philosophy
of the system is that feedback between the system loudspeakers and
microphones is undesirable since it produces colouration and
possible instability.The SIAP (System for Improved Acoustic Performance)
product is an in-line system which is designed to improve the
acoustic performance of an auditorium taking its acoustic character
into account, and without using acoustic feedback between the
loudspeakers and microphones - see W.C.J.M. Prinssen and M. Holden,
"System for improved acoustic performance", Proceedings of the
Institute of Acoustics, Vol. 14, Part 2 pp 933-101, 1992. The
system uses a number of supercardioid microphones placed close to
the stage to detect the direct sound and some of the early
reflected sound energy. Some reverberant energy is also detected,
but this is smaller in amplitude than the direct sound. The
microphone signals are processed and a number of loudspeakers are
used to broadcast the processed sound into the room. The system
makes no attempt to alter the room volume appreciably, because -
as the designers state - this can lead to a difference between the
vis
