<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U. S. Application
Serial No. 07/962,897 filed on October 16, 1992 and
entitled "Oven with Short Radius Door."The present invention relates to an oven and an
oven door, and in particular, to an oven with a door
having a concave interior surface, and more particularly
to an oven door with a concave interior which is hinged
at one side so that it opens about a short radius, and
which short radius oven door may support a rotatable
cooking tray within a portion of its concave interior, so
that the cooking tray swings out of the interior of the
oven when the oven door is opened. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMany ovens and oven configurations have been
designed in order to facilitate or enhance various
aspects of use and operation.For example, conveyor ovens have been designed and
constructed which carry a food product on a wire mesh
conveyor so that cooking or heating processes are applied
to the food as the conveyor moves the food product
through the oven. In order to accommodate the conveyor,
such ovens typically have an open entrance and an open
exit which may be shielded, but which nevertheless allows
heated air and radiation transfer between the interior
and the exterior of the oven through the open passages.Various ovens have been known in which the door
essentially comprises a flat surface which sealingly
abuts against the perimeter face of a rectangular
opening. Typical household ovens are of this type and
they usually have a wide interior opening to facilitate
loading and unloading of the oven. Loading and unloading
is also facilitated with slidable racks or wire shelves.
These racks typically must be separately slid in and out
after the oven door is fully open.Other ovens, such as pizza restaurant ovens, have
been designed with close top to bottom spacing in which
the food product is inserted by an operator with an
elongated peel. Without a peel or similar long-handled
tool, the operator would risk burning injuries by
sticking a hand into the oven.Ovens have been constructed and tested which have a
door-mounted rack for facilitating loading and unloading
as the rack pivots with the door into and out of the
heated oven area. One example of an oven with a door-mounted
rotary rack is disclosed in U. S. Patent No.
4,924,763 to Bingham. The rack can be conveniently 
loaded when the door is swung open. The food is
automatically placed in the heated section upon closing
the door. Some racks have been made rotatable to
facilitate even heating and food processing as
