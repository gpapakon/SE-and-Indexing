<ABSTRACT>
A method for injection molding polyethylene 
terephthalate by employing a vent type injection unit as 

means for omitting preliminary drying the resin, wherein the 
unit does not develop a poor screw biting, and even when a 

molding material is an undried uncrystallized or crystallized 
PET, can feed a certain amount of the material at all times 

to injection mold a desired transparent molded form such as a 
preform, and use the preform to produce a thin-wall container 

with a low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
injection molding an uncrystallized or crystallized 
polyethylene terephthalate into a desired molded form such as 
preform, with pre-drying omitted. A pellet of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
produced by bulk polymerizing of ethylene glycol with 
terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate is an 
uncrystallized and transparent material. The PET whose 
moisture content does not reach an equilibrium has further 
moisture-absorption characteristics and thus when the PET is 
molten in a moisture absorbed condition, a hydrolysis 
develops to cause the PET not to be molded. An uncrystallized PET pellet, when heated to a 
temperature above its glass transition point (Tg), becomes 
softened somewhat to have an adhesive characteristics. The 
adhesive characteristics causes the PET pellets to be poorly 
bitten into a screw and thus not to be fed when molding. On 
the other hand, a crystallized PET pellet, even at a 
temperature above its Tg, is not softened, thereby keeping  
 
hardness and having no adhesive characteristics. Thus, material manufacturers dry an uncrystallized 
PET pellet at a temperature of 150 to 160°C to produce a 
dehumidified and crystallized PET pellet which is sold as a 
commercially available molding material. This causes an 
ordinary and commercially available PET to become more 
expensive than an uncrystallized PET. The uncrystallized 
PET, which has been sold by some of material manufacturers, 
has been dried to effect dehumidification and crystallization 
by molding manufacturers before use. Therefore, the 
crystallized PET described herein means a dried commercially 
available product, while the uncrystallized PET means an 
undried product. In molding a product using the PET as a 
material, even the crystallized PET has a moisture-absorption 
characteristics in nature and thus absorbs moisture content 
to some extent varying with control conditions before it is 
used as a molding material, thus it is customary to dry 
preliminarily the PET immediately before molding. It takes about four hours to accomplish the 
preliminary drying at a temperature of 150°C. Both the 
increased usage of material per hour to improve a molding 
cycle efficiency, and the consideration to the prevention of 
a shortage of fed material even for a long time operation 
cause a dryer installed to an injection molding machine to 
become inevitably large in size and the power consumption  
 
required for drying to tend to increase. Problems exist in 
that it

<CLAIMS>
A method for injection molding undried polyethylene 
terephthalate as a material resin, wherein 

a vent type injection unit is employed 
in which an injection screw (1) comprising a first stage (10) and a 

second stage (20) is rotatably and movably mounted in a heating 
cylinder (2) having a vent (3), the method being characterised in that 

the feed rate of the material 
resin to a feed zone (12) of the first stage (10) of the vent type 

injection unit is limited in such a manner that the material 
resin is not accumulated due to compression even if the 

material resin is softened before reaching a compression zone (13) 
following the feed zone (12) said feed rate limitation is 

effected by making a sectional area of the screw groove in a 
receiving zone (11) at the feed zone rear end at which a hopper 

port (4) of the first stage (10) is located smaller than a sectional 
area of
 the screw groove in the feed zone (12). 
A method for injection molding polyethylene 
terephthalate as set forth in claim 1, wherein the sectional 

area of the screw groove in the above-mentioned receiving 
zone (11) is set to no larger than 3/4 the sectional area of the 

screw groove in feed zone (12), and the screw is formed in a  
 

double screw to the halfway position of the compression zone (13), 
and then in a single screw from the compression zone to the 

metering zone (14) so as to set the screw pitch (P) to a large value, 
thereby making sufficient the stretching of a molten resin to 

improve the vent effect in the vent of the second zone. 
A method for injection molding polyethylene 
terephthalate as set forth in claim 1, wherein the removal of 

the moisture content in the resin from the heating cylinder (2) 
is performed by being sucked under a reduced pressure by 

means of a vacuum pump, which removal is not interrupted even 
when injecting during operation, and when injecting, the 

reduced pressure is set to a lower value when plasticating, 
thereby preventing a vent up due to the forward movement of 

the injection screw (1). 
A method for injection molding polyethylene 
terephthalate as set forth in claim 1, wherein the heating 

temperature on the second stage (20) side of the heating cylinder 
is set to a value lower than the heating temperature on the 

first stage side (10), thereby preventing the molten PET from 
being overheated. 
A method for injection molding polyethylene 
terephthalate as set forth in claim 1, wherein the molding  

 
material is a crystallized polyethylene terephthalate 

produced with preliminary drying omitted.  
 
A method for injection molding polyethylene terephthalate as set forth in claim 
1, wherein the article to be molded is a preform of a thin-wall packaging container 

molded by stretch-blow molding. 
A method for injection molding polyethylene terephthalate as set forth in claim 
1, wherein the molding material is an uncrystallized polyethylene terephthalate 

with the preliminary drying omitted.
