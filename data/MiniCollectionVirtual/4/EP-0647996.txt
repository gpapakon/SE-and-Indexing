<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reactors for the 
processing of materials in the gaseous phase by means of 
corona discharges. Considerable effort is being expended on the 
development of techniques for carrying out processes in 
the gaseous phase, using species which have been 
activated by corona discharges. Corona discharges occur 
in gaseous media when the localised electric field in the 
neighbourhood of a body exceeds the electrical breakdown 
voltage of the gaseous medium. Existing corona discharge 
reactors consist of a chamber having an inlet and an 
outlet for a gaseous medium, an axial wire inner 
electrode and a cylindrical outer electrode surrounding 
the inner electrode. The electrical discharge within 
such reactors consists of streamers extending from the 
inner electrode towards the outer electrode. For the 
effective processing of a gaseous medium passing through 
the reactor, it is necessary to produce as many corona 
streamers as possible because any space which does not 
contain such streamers is dead space as far as the 
processing of the gaseous medium is concerned. Unfortunately, the rapid fall-off in the electric 
field in a central wire electrode type of corona 
discharge reactor means that the corona discharge 
streamers propagate only a short distance from the 
central wire. This phenomenon restricts the diameter of 
a practicable reactor to a few centimetres. It is not 
practicable to compensate for this by increasing the 
length of the reactor because of the lack of mechanical 
strength of the inner electrode. Thus existing corona 
discharge reactors have diameters of a few centimetres 
and lengths of a few tens of centimetres. As a result,  
 
to process reasonable volumes of gas, high flow rates are 
required, which in turn tend to increase the mechanical 
instability of the central electrode due to aerodynamic 
effects as well as leading to short residence times in 
the reactor chamber of the medium to be processed. 
Hence, existing corona discharge reactors are limited 
inherently in their effectiveness. US patent 5,061,462 discloses an apparatus for 
producing a corona discharge, specifically for the 
purification of internal combustion exhaust gases, in 
which a streamer type corona discharge is established in 
a reactor chamber between a first electrode, which may be 
in the form of a rod with a screw thread formed in its 
surface to provide an extended edge to facilitate the 
formation of a corona discharge and a second electrode 
which has an insulating surface
