<ABSTRACT>
3-Fluoro-4,6-dichlorotoluene is prepared with reduced formation of 3-fluoro-2,6-dichlorotoluene by chlorinating 3-fluorotoluene in the presence of a catalyst system to give a mixture containing 3-fluoro-6-chlorotoluene and 3-fluoro-4-chlorotoluene, and chlorinating this in the presence of another catalyst system to give 3-fluoro-4,6-dichlorotoluene.

Process for preparing 3-fluoro-4,6-dichlorotoluene 
with reduced formation of 3-fluoro-2,6-dichlorotoluene, 

characterized in that 3-fluorotoluene is 
chlorinated in the presence of Friedel-Crafts catalysts 

and sulphur to give a mixture containing 3-fluoro-6-chlorotoluene 
and 3-fluoro-4-chlorotoluene 

and this is chlorinated in the presence of Friedel-Crafts 
catalysts and thiazepine compounds to give 3-fluoro-4,6-dichlorotoluene. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the Friedel-Crafts catalysts used in both reaction 

stages are iron(III) chloride, antimony(III) chloride, 
antimony(V) chloride or aluminium chloride and 

in the first reaction stage are used in an amount of 
from 0.05 to 5% by weight (based on 3-fluorotoluene) 

and in the second reaction stage are used in an 
amount of from 0.1 to 10% by weight (based on 3-fluoro-chlorotoluenes). 
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,  
 

characterized in that from 0.05 to 5% by weight of 
sulphur (based on 3-fluorotoluene) are used. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the first reaction stage is carried 

out at from 0 to 60°C and from 0.8 to 1.1 mol of 
chlorine are introduced per mol of 3-fluorotoluene. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that low-boiling by-products, in particular 

volatile sulphur compounds, are separated off 
prior to the second reaction stage. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the thiazepine compounds used are 

those of the formulae (I) to (VII)

weight (based on 3-fluoro-chlorotoluenes). 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the second reaction stage is carried 

out at from 50 to 120°C and from 0.8 to 1.0 mol of 
chlorine is introduced per mol of 3-fluoro-chlorotoluenes. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that after completion of the second 

reaction stage the thiazepine compounds are separated 
off and again added to a further batch. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the isomeric 3-fluoro-4,6-dichlorotoluene 

and 3-fluoro-2,6-dichlorotoluene present in 
the reaction mixture after the second reaction stage

Process according to any of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the 3-fluoro-dichlorotoluene isomers 

present after completion of the second reaction 
stage are subjected to a side-chain chlorination and

chloride/benzotrichloride mixture.
