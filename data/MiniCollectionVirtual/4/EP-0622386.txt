<ABSTRACT>
A thermosetting in-mold coating for molded 
fiber-reinforced plastic parts is disclosed. The binder 

for the thermosetting coating is comprised of least one 
polymerizable epoxy-based oligomer having at least two 

acrylate groups and at least one copolymerizable 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer. The coating includes 

graphite and titanium dioxide which results in the gray 
color. The coating composition has good flow and coverage 

during molding, good adhesion, uniform color, good surface 
quality, and good paintability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification relates to thermosetting
coating compositions, e.g. usable for in-mold coating of
molded plastic such as polyester resin, vinyl ester resin,
or poly(ethylene terephthalate) mouldings or parts.Molded plastic parts can be in-mold coated with
electrically conductive coatings. These parts can then be
electrostatically painted. Conductive in-mold coatings
using carbon black exclusively as the conductive pigment
are black. When light coloured e.g. white paints are
used, large amounts or multiple layers of the lighter
coloured paints are required.An aim herein is to provide new and useful coating
compositions, their preparation and use, and preferably
enabling a lighter coloured conductive in-mold coating,
requiring less light coloured paint for effective covering
e.g. so that both time and materials may be saved.We have found that conductive in-mold coatings of
lighter colour, such as grey, can be produced using
graphite as part, a major portion or all of the conductive
component and a lighter-coloured e.g. white pigment such
as titanium dioxide to create a more light reflective
surface. These in-mold coatings may be effectively
painted with light coloured paints.Broadly, therefore, the invention provides in-mold
coating compositions containing particulate graphite as a 
conductive filler (optionally in combination with carbon
black) together with light-coloured e.g. white pigment.
Corresponding methods of preparation and use are also
included.The thermosetting coating compositions according to
the invention are based upon a polymerizable
epoxy-based oligomer having at least two acrylate (or
methacrylate or ethacrylate) groups and are prepared by
reacting acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid,
with an epoxy based oligomer or resin
such as bisphenol A epoxy, a tetrabromo bisphenol A epoxy,
phenolic novalak epoxy, tetraphenylolethane epoxy,
dicycloaliphatic epoxy and equivalents. Mixtures of these
epoxy based oligomers can be used. The term (alkyl)
acrylate shall be used to specify acrylate, methacrylate,
or ethacrylate. Of these materials it is preferred to use
a diacrylate terminated bisphenol A epoxy oligomer. They
have weight average molecular weights of from about 500 to
about 1,500. Such materials are well known to the art and
to the literature, as for example, Cargill Resin 1570, a
diacrylate ester of a liquid bisphenol A epoxy resin.
Examples of other suitable materials can be found in "Heat
Resistant Vinyl Ester Resin," M.B. Launikitis, Technical
Bulletin, SC:116-76,
