Low-noise, variable-gain amplifier stage in a
cascode circuit,


having a first series circuit comprising the load
paths of two transistors (12, 22) and of a first

resistor (32) which is connected to a reference-earth
potential terminal,
having at least one second series circuit comprising
the load paths of two transistors (13...21, 23...31;

67, 68), and of a second resistor (33...41; 69)
which is connected to the reference-earth potential

terminal, with the second series circuit being
connected in parallel with the first series circuit

(12, 22, 32),
in which the collector connections of each of the
first transistors (12...21; 67) in the series

circuits are connected in parallel and are coupled
to an output terminal (46), with the output terminal

(46) being connected via a tuned circuit (43, 44) to
a supply voltage terminal (42),
provided with first and second reference voltage
sources (4, 5), with the first reference voltage

source being supplied to the base connections of
each of the first transistors (12...21; 67) in the

series circuits, and the second reference voltage
being supplied to the base connections of each of

the second transistors (22...31; 68) in the series
circuits, and with the base connections of each of 

the second transistors in the series circuits being
coupled to an input terminal (11),
in which at least one switching means (48, 49, 51,
52) connects the junction point of the load paths of

the transistors in each second series circuit to the
supply voltage terminal (42), depending on a control

signal.
Amplifier stage according to Claim 1,

in which the second series circuit comprises a large
number of parallel-connected, first and second

transistors.
Amplifier stage according to one of the
preceding claims,

in which the second reference voltage is supplied via
an inductor to the base connections of each of the

second transistors in the series circuits.
