<ABSTRACT>
The residence time distribution of materials in an extruder can 
modified to give a residence time distribution comparable to that obtained in a 

continuous stirred tank reactor by providing in the extruder a section having non 
intermeshing counter-rotating twin screws with flights having the same directional 

pitch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an extruder
according to the precharacterising part of claim 1
and to a process
according to the precharacterising part of claim 3.Single and twin screw extruders have been used as reactors for various fluids
and polymer systems. Reactions which have been conducted within extruders
extend from controlled degradation reduction of molecular weight of polymer to
grafting reactions or side group modifications and in-situ polymerizations.An important variable when using an extruder as a reactor is the mean
residence time and the residence time distribution of the materials within a selected
section of an extruder. By "mean residence time" we mean the average time of all
fluid materials spent in a particular section of the extruder or of any process vessel.
By the "residence time distribution" we mean the distribution of residence times
about the mean which each fluid material spends in the extruder or process vessel.Generally, extruders have been used in connection with reactions or
operations which do not require a residence time distribution similar to that which
would be obtained in a continuous stirred reactor. For example, in a
polycondensation reaction, molecular weight build-up is achieved by the gradual
coupling of A-B type monomeric units into dimers and trimers. Molecular weight is
achieved by the coupling of two smaller chains to form one larger one. In this case,
such polycondensation reaction favors a plug flow distribution because in a plug
flow distribution, there is no back-mixing and instead, the material which enters the
extruder first also leaves the extruder first. Thus, in a polycondensation reaction, a
plug flow distribution prevents the established chains from mixing with fresh
monomer and instead, allows the chains to couple and build molecular weight.There are however, certain types of reactions for which back-mixing is
considered critical in order to obtain the desired product. For example, when one
polymerizes methyl methacrylate to obtain poly (methyl methacrylate), (a free
radical reaction) it is important that the molecular weight of the polymer be built
and that the molecular weight distribution be narrow. As an initiated polymer chain
begins to grow, it requires a constant fresh supply of monomer in order to build the
molecular weight. This of course is unlike a polycondensation reaction which
requires the coupling of dimers and trimers. In a plug-flow type of arrangement in
an extruder, there would be no or little opportunity for fresh monomer to

<CLAIMS>
A counter-rotating, non-intermeshing twin screw extruder (4) having
an inlet (2) for introduction of material into said extruder, an outlet (18) for

discharge of material from said extruder, and counter-rotating non-intermeshing
twin screws (10, 12) having flights (20) thereon and disposed

substantially parallel to one another, characterized in that a portion of said screws (10, 12)
defines a reaction or mixing zone within the extruder (4), the flights (20) of each of the

screws (10, 12) in said reaction or mixing zone have the same directional pitch, and flow
restriction means (8, 14) are located at the beginning and end of the reaction or

mixing zone and are present on at least one of said screws (10, 12).
An extruder (4) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the flow restriction
means (8) at the beginning of the reaction or mixing zone is on a different screw (10, 12) than

the flow restriction means (14) at the end of the reaction or mixing zone.
A process for increasing the mean residence time and improving the
residence time distribution of materials in the reaction or mixing zone of an extruder

(4), characterized in that it comprises the steps of: feeding material into the reaction
or mixing zone of an extruder as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2; counter rotating said

twin screws (10 and 12); restricting the flow of material from the reaction or mixing
zone toward the discharge outlet (18) and from the reaction or mixing zone toward

the entrance inlet (2); moving material along one of the screws (10, 12) in a direction,
from an area proximate the discharge outlet (18), toward the entrance inlet (2);

transferring material to the second screw (10,12); and discharging material from the
reaction or mixing zone through said discharge outlet (18).
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the reaction conducted in the
extruder (4) is a free radical reaction.
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the reaction conducted in the

extruder (4) is a grafting or block polymerization reaction.
A process as claimed in any of claims 3 to 5, wherein the reaction
conducted in the extruder (4) is the polymerization of methyl methacrylate.
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the reaction conducted in the
extruder (4) is the imidization of polymethacrylate.
