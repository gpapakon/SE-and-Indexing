<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the invention, a metal substrate (10) is coated with a multilayer
surface finish (11) comprising, in succession, an amorphous metal underlayer (12) a corrosion-resistent

metal middle layer (13) and one or more outer layers of precious metal (14). In an
exemplary embodiment the metal substrate comprises copper alloy, the amorphous

metal underlayer is Ni-P, the middle layer is nickel and the outer layer is palladium.
The resulting structure is particularly useful as an electrical connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plated metal articles for protecting a metal substrate
from corrosion and, in particular, to an article having a multilayer finish comprising an.
amorphous metal underlayer, a corrosion-resistant metal middle layer and one or more
precious metal outer layers. The surface finish is especially useful for electrical and
electronic devices such as connectors and integrated circuit lead frames.Corrosion resistance is particularly important in electrical and electronic devices
including electrical connectors. High quality connectors are increasingly important in a
wide variety of products including consumer electronics, household appliances,
computers, automobiles, telecommunications, robotics and military equipment.
Connectors provide the paths whereby electrical current flows from one device to
another. Quality connectors should be highly conductive, corrosion resistant, wear
resistant, readily connected by solder and preferably inexpensive.Unfortunately no single material has all of the desired characteristics. Copper
and many of its alloys are highly conductive, but they are subject to corrosion in typical
ambients, producing reactive oxides and sulfides. The corrosion products on the surface
reduce the conductivity of the connectors and the reliability of interconnection. The
reactive corrosion products also interfere with the formation and reliability of solder
bonds and can migrate to other electronic components which they adversely affect.Thin precious metal layers have been applied to copper surfaces to increase
corrosion resistance. But the precious metal layers are porous, and corrosion through
the pores continues to be a problem.Nickel coatings have been applied under the precious metal outer layer to serve
as barriers to the formation and migration of reactive copper products. However nickel 
coatings also exhibit porosity. Although the porosity and corrosion are reduced by the
nickel barrier, the corrosion products of copper can still form and migrate through the
finish. The porosity of the nickel coatings can be reduced by increasing the nickel
thickness, but thick nickel coatings take substantially longer to produce and tend to
crack in use. Longer production times mean lower productivity and higher production
cost.An improved integrated circuit lead frame comprising copper coated with nickel
followed by a composite of noble metal layers is described in United States Patent No.
5,675,177. These coated lead frames have high corrosion resistance and good electrical
and
