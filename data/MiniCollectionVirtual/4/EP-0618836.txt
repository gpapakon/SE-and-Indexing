<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of
reverse osmosis as an alternate or substitute method for
the purification of a crude diagnostic agent, and more
particularly, to an improved method of purifying crude
Ioversol by removing a variety of small molecular weight
process impurities present in the crude form thereof.Ioversol is disclosed as a useful nonionic X-ray
contrast agent in U.S. Patent Number 4,396,598,
N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-[N(2-hydroxyethyl)
glycolamido] -2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide,
more commonly called Ioversol has the following structure:
In the production of Ioversol, purification
columns are used to remove impurities from the crude
Ioversol product following completion of the synthetic
steps as described in U.S. Patent Number 4,396,598
The costs and time
involved in a purification operation, such as regenerating
and replacing the purification columns is significant in
the purification of Ioversol. Large amounts of costly
resins and large volumes of solutions are also necessary to
regenerate the purification columns between uses. These 
costs are significant in the production of Ioversol.An improved procedure which eliminates the need for
costly purification columns to remove low molecular weight
impurities from the crude Ioversol product following
synthesis thereof is desired as an alternative and/or a more
cost efficient method of producing Ioversol. It is,
therefore, an object of the present invention to meet these
needs.M.C. Porter et al. in Chem. Technology, Jan. 1971,
pages 56-63 review the use of membrane ultrafiltration to
remove low molecular-weight materials from liquids
containing polymeric and other high-molecular weight
materials.R. Rautenbach et al. in Desalination, vol. 77, pages
73-84 (1990) describe the use of nanofiltration membranes
having a molecular weight cut-off around 300 daltons in
separation processes.EP-A-0391621 describes the preparation of an iodized
hydroxyethyl starch for use as an x-ray contrast medium.
The products are purified by means of ultrafiltration or
column chromatography.EP-A-0186947 describes the use of dialysis to purify
macromolecular paramagnetic complexes for use as contrast
agents in nmr imaging.US-A-5114703 describes the use of reverse osmosis to
remove low molecular weight impurities from dispersion of
non-water-soluble fluorocarbon particles in the 5-10nm size
range for use as diagnostic contrast agents.T. Gulbrandsen et al. in the proceedings of the
Organisk-Kjemisk Vintermote Fefore, 8th-11th January 1987,
describe the use
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of purification of a crude Ioversol process stream
comprising the steps of:


(a) passing said crude Ioversol process stream
into a housing cartridge (16)

containing a cross-linked reverse osmosis membrane (18); and
(b) applying pressure within said housing cartridge (16)
to said crude Ioversol process stream

whereby low molecular weight impurities within
said crude Ioversol process stream are forced through pores in said

cross-linked reverse osmosis membrane to form a permeate stream, while
purified Ioversol passes over said cross-linked reverse osmosis

membrane (18) to form a retentate stream,
provided that no second membrane filtration step is

carried out to recover Ioversol from the
permeate stream.
A method of purification according to claim 1,
wherein said pressure within said housing cartridge (16) is

within the range of 0.7 to 8.3 MPa (100 to 1,200 pounds per
square inch or 7 to 80 atmospheres).
A method of purification according to any preceding
claim, wherein said low molecular weight impurities are

selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol,
dimethylsulfoxide, propylene glycol, chlorinated C
1-10

alkyls, C
1-10
 alcohols and formaldehyde.
A method of purification according to any preceding 
claim, wherein the reverse osmosis membrane (18) is a cross-linked

polyamide membrane.
