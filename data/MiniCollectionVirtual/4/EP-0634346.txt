<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a support unit for the walls 
or guides 
of 
conveying lines. Conveying lines which advance objects one at a time in succession 
are known to be provided with lateral walls which serve to guide 
the objects by delimiting the advancement track along which the 
objects advance. As the object size can vary, it is necessary if this happens to 
correspondingly vary the distance apart or the gauge of the two 
walls or guides, this operation, which has to maintain the 
symmetry of the walls 
or guides 
about the conveyor axis, being very lengthy 
and laborious, and involving line down-times which often cannot be 
tolerated. The object of the present invention is to provide a support unit 
for said walls 
or guides 
which enables the distance between the walls 
or guides to be precisely adjusted while maintaining their 
symmetry, and ensures that they remain in the required position 
after each adjustment. Said object is attained by the wall or guide support unit of the 
invention, as characterised in the claims. The invention is described in detail hereinafter with reference to 
the accompanying figures, which illustrate one embodiment thereof. 
Figure 1 is a top plan view of a conveying line portion to which  
 
the support unit of the invention is applied. Figure 2 is a front view of the invention with some parts shown in 
section. Figure 3 is an enlarged detail of Figure 1 with some parts shown 
in section. Figure 4 is a section on the plane IV-IV of Figure 3. Figure 5 is a section on the plane V-V of Figure 4.  Figure 6 is a section analogous to that of Figure 5 showing a 
second embodiment of the invention.  Figure 7 is an exploded isometric view of part of the unit of the 
invention shown in Figure 5.  Figure 8 is an exploded isometric view of part of the unit of the 
invention shown in Figure 6.  Figures 1 and 2 show a conveying line portion to which the support 
unit of the invention is applied. Said line comprises two conveyor belts which pass about pulleys 3 
keyed onto the shaft 4, which is carried by supports 5 fixed to 
two lateral beams 6 positioned externally to the belts 2 and 
forming part of the frame of the conveying line. The reference numeral 7 indicates cross-members which, in 
positions distributed along the line, connect together the beams 
6. Objects 9 (Figure 2), which in the illustrated case are flat 
objects such as ceramic tiles, rest on the belts 2. To guide the objects 9 while travelling on the belts 2 there are 
provided two walls 
or guides

<CLAIMS>
A support unit for the walls or guides of conveying lines, comprising a 
cross-member (11) positioned above the conveying line(2) and orthogonal 

thereto to support two clamps (20) for supporting the walls or guides (8), the 
clamps (20) being slidable along the cross-member (11), characterised in that it 

comprises two bars (16) sliding within an aperture (112) provided in the lower 
part of the cross-member (11), the cross-member (11) being of constant hollow 

cross-section and the bars (16) being provided with racks (161) which engage in a 
common central pinion (13) keyed onto a member (14) emerging from above 

the cross-member where it is engaged by a knob (12), each bar (16) carrying a 
clamp (20) at its lower part for supporting the wall or guide, and means (15, 17, 155, 

122) being provided to maintain said member in position. 
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that each 
clamp (20) for the walls or guides (8) comprises: 


an upper element (21) to be fixed against the surface of the 
respective bar (16) and slidable within the cavity of 

the cross-member (11); 
a lower element (22) positioned external to the cross-member (11), 
for connection to the walls or guides (8); 
a narrow portion (23) joining the upper element (21) to the lower 
element (22) and passing through the longitudinal lower aperture 

(112) in the cross-member (11); 
gasket means (26) positioned to close said aperture (112) but 
allowing passage of the intermediate element (23) 
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the member (14) forms 
the shank of the knob (12) and operates the mechanism (13, 16) and is inserted 

into a hole (111) provided in the cross-member (11) and having its axis 
perpendicular to this latter;
 
and it comprises: 


a first annular member (15) forced into the hole (111) to act as a bush for the 
member (14), having an upper cylindrical outer surface (151) which is external 

to the cross member (11) and has its axis not aligned with the axis of the member 
(14), the member (14) being inserted into the hole (111) by way of the annular 

member (15),
