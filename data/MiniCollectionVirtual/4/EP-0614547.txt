<ABSTRACT>
In this regulator is obtained a correcting variable as the sum of a linear compensation term and a product term, whereby the compensation term is a linear combination of a contouring error and its time-derivatives and whereby the product term is formed by the muliplication of a fuzzy control term by a saturation term. This regulator combines the advantages of the sliding mode controller with a boundary layer and those of the fuzzy controller and thus forms a robost regulator for a wide range of non-linear nth-order systems.

Controller for controlling dynamic nth-order 
systems, in which a manipulated variable u is produced as 

a sum 
u
 = 
C
 + 
P
 of a linear compensation term C and a 
product term P, 


a) the linear compensation term C being a linear combination 

 
of a contouring error e and its time derivatives 
e
(n-k)
, λ 
denoting a reciprocal time constant, 
b) the product term P being formed by multiplying 
P

K
F
 
× 
sat
 of a fuzzy control term KF by a saturation term 
sat, 
c) the saturation term sat being a function of the time 
derivatives 
s(x,t)=(d/dt
 + λ
)
(n-1)
e
 of the contouring error 
and a boundary layer constant Φ
>

relationship 


 
and 
d) the fuzzy control term KF being determined with the 
aid of fuzzy rules of the form IF sp=spi AND d=di THEN 

uN=uNi, in whose condition part the distance sp of the 
state vector x of the system to be controlled from a 

sliding surface (SS) and the distance D from the 
direction of the normal vector of the sliding surface  

 
(SS) are determined, the sliding surface (SS) being given 

by the relationship 

s(x,t)=(d/dt
 + λ
)
