<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a flange (F) which serves as 
a joint and which is adapted to be stably and firmly 

attached to the open end of a duct (d) for air-conditioning or 
smoke discharge simply by inserting it in the open end of 

the duct. To this end, a plurality of wedge pawls (I) are 
formed by inward or outward lancing-up in the vicinity of 

the open end of the duct, while the lip-like attaching base 
which is one side of the flange formed of a single metal 

plate bent in substantially L-shape is turned back and 
laminated to form inner and outer base lips having cushion 

spaces defined therein, said cushion spaces being filled 
with a sealant for sealing the duct, the arrangement being 

such that when the attaching base is inserted in the open 
end of the duct with an insertion port defined between the 

two base lips, a holding hook turned back from one of the 
base lips inseparably engages the wedge pawls and the duct 

is maintained air-tight by the sealant.

<DESCRIPTION>
Flange connections for ducts used for air-conditioning 
and smoke discharge in buildings are known in the art. For 
example, such flange connections are disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication Nos. 8716/1980 and 50237/1980; U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,940,264, 3,923,326, and 3,712,650; U.K. 
Patent 1,275,526; German Patent No. 2,034,005 and 
1,946,547. These known inventions are basically the same and U.S. 
Patent No. 3,923,326 will be taken up for discussion, 
wherein, as can be seen in Figs. 1 and 10, the flanges 
(frame members ) 24 and 26 serving as piping joints for the 
duct 12 are of double construction, each formed by folding 
a single metal plate in two. Each flange is L-shaped in 
cross section, having attaching bases 28 and 37 of given 
length extending longitudinally of the duct 12, and 
connection masts 29 and 32 extending upward by a given 
height radially of the duct 12. And a corner metal fixture (bent metal fixture) 39 for 
the duct 12 is undetachably inserted into the hollow space 
defined by the connection masts 29 and 32, while the 
attaching bases 28 and 37 are inserted in the open end 23 
of the duct 12 to clamp it therebetween, whereupon the  
 
attaching bases 28 and 37 and the duct 12 are integrally 
fixedly by spot welds 38 at given intervals. With this arrangement, however, after the attaching 
bases 28 and 37 of the flanges 24 and 26 have been inserted 
in the duct 12, spot welds 38 have to be made at a number 
of regularly spaced points, so that the operation is very 
troublesome, requiring a long time and much labor. Further, since a spot welding machine has to be used, 
except the case where the flanges 24 and 26 are to be 
attached to the duct 12 in a manufacturing plant, if a new 
separate duct 12 has to be added to branch from an 
intermediate region of the existing duct 12 or if a damper 
has to be added to the existing duct 12, the operation of 
attaching the flanges 24 and 26 to the duct 12 cannot be 
performed as remodeling work in the job site. Further, in the above known invention, since the area 
where each of the flanges 24 and 26 is fixed consists of 
only two layers, i.e., the outside contact region 37 and 
the inside contact region 28 of the duct 12, there is a 
danger of the duct 12 being accidentally deformed during 
transport to the job site or during handling, a fact which, 
coupled with the fact that said spot welds 38 are likely to 
rust, means that the duct 12 still lacks durability. As 
measures against this, the insertion length of the 
attaching bases 28
