<ABSTRACT>
In the bulk material container with a bottom discharging valve, a valve seat (2) with an inlet side (25) of conical design is arranged in a guide tube (1) which is fixed on the bottom outlet of the container (24). On the outlet side, a curved valve plate (3) is supported on the valve seat, projects with its curvature into the opening of the valve seat (2) and has a guide pin (4) on its hollow side. The guide pin is mounted in a sliding manner in a guide sleeve (6), arranged in the guide tube (1), and is connected to an actuating device.

A bulk material container having a bottom outlet valve, wherein, in a
conductor tube (1), which is attached at the bottom outlet of the

container (24), there is arranged a valve seat (2) having a conically
shaped feed side (25) on which is mounted on the outlet side a dished

valve disk (3) which, in the closed valve position, is supported by its
dishing on the opening of the valve seat (2) and which has on its hollow

side a guide pin (4) which is mounted to be able to slide in a guide
sleeve (6) arranged in the conductor tube (1) and which is connected to

an actuating device, which has a mechanical drive.
The bulk material container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the valve
seat (2) is designed to be elastic and has a sealing lip (26), on which

the valve disk (3) is supported on the outlet side.
The bulk material container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the actuating
device consists of a flexible shaft (16) and lever system (13, 14).
