<ABSTRACT>
Cooling unit for coffins comprising a refrigerating circuit in which a first heat exchange 
fluid circulates therein and a second circuit in which a second heat exchange fluid 

circulates, connected with a refrigerating plate in a condition of heat exchange with the 
coffin. The plate is of disposable kind i.e. detachable from the remaining of the cooling 

unit and left into the coffin after the final closure thereof. Means are also provided to 
allow the draining of the heat exchange fluid from the refrigerating plate and the 

recovery of said fluid in a suitable tank to allow the reuse of the remaining part of the 
cooling unit by insertion of other plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a cooling unit for coffins comprising a refrigerating
circuit and a refrigerating plate which is in a situation of heat exchange with the
interior of the coffin.More particularly the invention concerns a cooling unit of the above-mentioned kind
wherein the cooling unit consists of a detachable coil which a heat exchange
refrigerating fluid flows therein.Similar cooling units are known in the art, for instance the one described in the
European Patent NÂ° EP 230.595 of the same applicant.The above embodiment includes a freon circulating cooling unit consisting of two
parts, the first comprises all the elements of the refrigerating circuit, preferably
contained in a transportable container, the second, namely the plate constituting the
evaporator, consists of a preloaded coil connectable with, or detachable from the
remaining part of the unit by means of rapid connections set up on the delivery and
exit pipes to seal the corresponding parts of the refrigerating circuit after the relative
detachment. All elements of the refrigerating circuit, with the exclusion of the plate,
can be subsequently reused to be connected to another plate associated with another
coffin.On the contrary, the plate is a disposable element and it is left in the coffin after the
final closure thereof, involving therefore the loss of the freon contained therein. It has
to be considered that the amount of freon contained into the evaporator, in the normal
operating conditions, is remarkably higher than the preloaded amount at room
temperature.Other losses, even though less substantial, take place at the time of disconnecting the
evaporator from the remaining part of unit in correspondence of the rapid attachments,
said losses being due to a difference between the pressure of freon contained in the
coil and the external atmospheric pressure.One of the drawback of the above cooling unit is due to the fact that, by using many
times the reusable part of the refrigerating circuit, a gradual decrease of the amount of
the fluid in the circuit takes place. Such decrease implies frequent and expensive
circuit refilling operations as well as the availability of a tank of such a size as to
contain a sufficient amount of fluid to assure a suitable operating duration to the
reusable unit. An additional drawback is due to the harmless freon leaking in the atmosphere, since,
as it is well known, freon is a polluting fluid.WO-A-8912792 relates to a method and apparatus to fully withdraw refrigerant from
entire cooling
