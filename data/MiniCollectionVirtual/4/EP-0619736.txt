 ANTIPARASITIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDES ACTIVE AGAINST DRUG RESISTANT MALARIA1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to the treatment of parthogenic infections through the use of chemotherapeutic agents. More specifically, the invention relates to the treatment of infections by parthogens having resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as drug resistant malaria.2. Summary of the Related ArtMalaria is one of the most widespread of human pathogenic diseases, accounting for high morbidity and mortality, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa and South America. Partial success in the eradication of this disease has been obtained by control-of mosquito populations, institution of vaccination programs and treatment with antimalarial drugs. However, multiple resistance to antimalarial drugs has been largely responsible for a resurgence in the incidence and 
severity of this disease in recent years. Oaks et al. , "Malaria, Obstacles and Opportunities, A report of the committee for the study on malaria prevention and control: status review and alternative strategies", Division of International Health, Institute of Medicine, National Academy Press (1991) discloses up to date information about the disease, its clinical aspects, its etiological agent and vector, as well as current difficulties in controlling the disease and other aspects of the present spread of malaria.Malaria is just one of a variety of human parasitic infections having increased prevalence worldwide. Webster, in Section X of The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, (Gilman et al. , Eds.) Eight Edition, Pargamm Press (1991) discusses several factors responsible for the increase in parasitic infections generally, including population growth and crowding, poor sanitation, ' inadequate control of parasite vectors, introduction of agricultural water control systems, increased population migration, and development of resistance to agents used for chemotherapy or for control of 
vectors. In fact, acquired drug resistance has become a major public health problem concerning a variety of infectious pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Laboratory techniques for in vitro screening of antimalarial drugs are well known in the art. Such techniques utilize the asexual erythrocytic cycle of Plasmodium falciparum in cultured human red blood cells. Trager and Jensen, Science 193: 673-675 (1976) discloses continuous maintenance of human malarial parasites in vitro. Desjardins et al., Antimicrobial Agents and chemotherapy l6: 710-718 (1979)
