Excavator, bulldozer, loader, clearing plough or the 
like, with an undercarriage (2) having a cab (1), a jib 

(3) which is articulated to the undercarriage (2) and 
is preferably in several parts and a tool (4) in the 

form of a shovel, grab, blade or bucket preferably 
articulated to the jib (3) via a shaft, and an exhaust 

system (6) connected via a suction pipe (7) to an 
exhaust unit (8) connected to the undercarriage (2) or 

vehicle, characterised in that the exhaust system (6) 
is an integral component of the tool (4) and is used 

for the direct aspiration of readily volatile 
contaminants consisting of gas-permeable material, in 

particular of soil, rubble, debris, etc. 
Excavator according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the exhaust system (6) comprises a perforated plate 

(10) which forms at least part of the internal wall (9) 
of the tool and is preferably designed as a filter or 

sieve plate and in that the orifices (11) forming the 
perforations in the plate (10) open via a suction duct 

(12) into the suction pipe (7). 
Excavator according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the plate (10) is reinforced relative to the external 

wall (13) of the tool or the tool frame (13) by at 

least one supporting cross member (14) and optionally 
rests on limiting pressure pads (15) and is screwed to 

the supporting cross member (14) in such a way that it 
is fixed between the pressure pads (15). 
Excavator according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the suction duct (12) has a connecting nozzle (17) 

preferably formed on the back of the tool (4) for 
connection of the suction pipe (7) and in that a water 

connection (18) for backwashing the suction duct (12) 
through the perforations in the plate (10) is 

optionally provided on the suction duct (12).  
 
Excavator according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the suction pipe (7) is guided 

via the jib (3) to the undercarriage (2) or to the 
exhaust unit (8) and in that the exhaust unit (8) is 

designed as a pump or compressor. 
Excavator, wherein the undercarriage (2) or the vehicle 
is driven by an internal-combustion engine and wherein 

the readily volatile contaminants are aromatic 
substances, hydrocarbons or the like, characterised in 

that the exhausted gas is supplied by means of the 
exhaust unit (8) to the air supply of the internal-combustion 

engine. 
Excavator according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the exhaust unit (8) is preceded 

or followed by a filter unit (20), the filter unit (20) 
preferably being an integral component of the exhaust 

unit (8). 
Excavator according to claim (7), characterised in that 
an active filter preferably designed as an active 

carbon filter or a biofilter is provided in the filter 
unit (20). 
Excavator according to one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that a washer with absorption agent, 

preferably with water or oil, is provided in the filter 
unit (20). 
Excavator according to one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that the filter unit (20) comprises a 

system for the catalytic combustion of the aspirated 
gas.
