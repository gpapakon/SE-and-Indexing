<ABSTRACT>
The closure element (2) for a pot (1) equipped with a neck (3) in order to trap a product, particularly a cosmetic product in this pot in a tamperproof manner is produced by dual injection of plastic and comprises a fastening ring (5) fixed to the neck (3) of the pot in a practically nondismantleable manner, this fastening ring being made of a first plastic, and a disc (8) forming a cover, made of a second plastic and connected to the fastening ring. The disc (8) is equipped with a pull means (12), opening the pot requiring the disc (8) to be separated from the fastening ring (5). The ring (5) and the disc (8) are made of two different substances, chosen to be incompatible so that no connection is established between them through hot melt, and the ring (5) is overmoulded onto the edge (10) of the disc (8), which edge (10) is thereby trapped in an annular groove (13) of the said ring.

Closure element (2) for a pot (1) equipped with 
a neck (3) in order to confine a product, particularly a 

cosmetic product, in this pot in a tamperproof manner, 
the said closure element (2) being produced by dual-injection 

of plastic and comprising a fastening ring (5) 
fixed onto the neck (3) of the pot in a practically non-removable 

manner, this fastening ring (5) being produced 
from a first plastic, and a disc (8), forming a lid, 

produced from a second plastic and connected to the 
fastening ring (5), this disc (8) being equipped with a 

pull means (12), it being necessary to separate the disc 
(8)
 from the fastening ring (5) in order to open the pot 
(1), characterized in that the ring (5) and the disc (8) 

are produced from two different materials which are 
chosen to be incompatible so that no connection becomes 

established between them by thermofusion, and that the 
ring (5) is overmoulded over the edge (10) of the disc, 

forming a collar, which edge (10) is trapped in an 
annular groove (13) in the said ring (5), that the groove 

(13) in the ring (5) has an axial thickness (
e
) and a 
radial depth (
h
) which are such that the closure produced 
by the element (2) fitted on the pot (1) is leaktight; 

and that the dimensions of the groove (13) are further 
designed so that after the disc (8) has been torn out and 

the edge (10) has been disengaged, this edge cannot be 
fitted back into the annular groove (13). 
Closure element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the two plastics used for injecting the 

two components (5, 8) of the closure element are made up 
by one of the polyethylene/polyacetate resin, polypropylene/polyethylene 

and (EPDM grafted onto polypropylene)/polyethylene 
pairings, it being possible for 

each of these materials to be used equally well for the 
ring (5) or for the disc (8), the other material being 

used for the disc (8) or the ring (5), the denomination 
EPDM denoting an ethylene propylene diene terpolymer. 
Closure element according to Claim 1 or 2,  
 

characterized in that the disc (8) includes a flat 
central part and, on its periphery, a skirt (9) capable 

of penetrating into the neck of the pot, the upper edge 
of this skirt including a collar-shaped extension (10) 

situated in a plane substantially parallel to that of the 
disc, this collar (10) being trapped in the groove (13) 

of the ring (5) during overmoulding. 
Closure element according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that a peripheral bead (11) is provided on the 

upper surface of the collar (10), substantially level 
with the outer surface of the skirt (9). 
Closure element according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the ring (5) includes on its upper 

surface an annular recess (14) which is open upwards and 
capable of receiving the collar (10) placed on the bottom 

of this recess. 
Closure element according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the assembly is designed 

for the minimum force to be exerted to separate the disc 
(8) from the ring (5) to be of the order of 1 daN. 
Closure element according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the disc (8) is equipped on 

its outer face with a tab (12) allowing a pulling force 
to be exerted in order to open the pot. 
Closure element according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the ring (5) includes on 

the upper internal border of the groove (13) a radial 
projection (15) towards the centre, of limited angular 

extent, the position of this projection (15) corresponding 
to that of the tab (12) of the disc. 
Method for manufacturing a closure element 
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 

in that two plastics which are incompatible with each 
other as well as suitable moulding conditions are chosen 

for the ring (5) and the disc (8) so that no connection 
by thermofusion is created, in that first of all the disc 

(8) is injected, then the ring (5) is overmoulded over 
the edge of the disc which is engaged in a complementary 

annular groove (13) in the ring.
