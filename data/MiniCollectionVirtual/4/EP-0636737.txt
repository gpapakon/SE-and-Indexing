<ABSTRACT>
Compositions for removing silicone oil fibre finishes (brightening agents) contain, as essential constituent, a surfactant with cationic groups on the surfactant skeleton; these surfactants can also be amphoteric surfactants or betaine surfactants. These compositions may further contain acids, nonanionic surfactants, water-soluble nonionic polymers and solvents (without halogenated hydrocarbons). The compositions can be used to produce aqueous dispersions in the form of concentrates (as sellable material) or in the form of dilute liquors directly usable in the wash. The compositions are used for removing silicone oil finishes from textile substrates, especially from elastane fibre substrates; for this the compositions are ultimately used in the form of wash liquors.
