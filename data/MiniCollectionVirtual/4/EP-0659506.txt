<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sliding gate closure for opening and closing the outlet channel of a casting vessel for metallic melts. The sliding gate closure comprises a sliding gate plate (16) which can be displaced relative to a head plate (12) arranged on the bottom of the casting vessel and formed integrally on the underside of which is a casting nozzle (20) with a flange (28). The flange (28) extends across the underside and at least part of the lateral edge of the sliding gate plate (16) and is surrounded by a steel frame (22). The pouring nozzle (20) comprises a tube section (26) which is composed throughout of a predetermined refractory material and, at the underside of the sliding gate plate (16), is separated from the flange (28) surrounded by the steel frame (22).

Gate closure for opening and closing the 
delivery channel of a pouring vessel for metallic melts, 

having a gate plate (16), which can be displaced in 
relation to a top plate (12) arranged on the bottom of 

the pouring vessel and on the underside of which a 
pouring-out nozzle (20) is arranged, which nozzle 

comprises a tube portion (26), consisting of predetermined 
refractory material throughout, and also a flange 

(28), which extends over the underside and at least part 
of the lateral edge of the gate plate (16), is enclosed 

by a steel frame (22) and is separated on the underside 
of the gate plate (16) with respect to the tube portion 

(26), characterized in that the tube portion (26), as 
well as the flange (28), is integrally formed on the 

underside of the gate plate (16) and has a steel casing 
(24), which extends through the steel frame (22) of the 

flange (28) as far as the underside of the gate plate 
(16). 
Gate closure according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the flange (28) consists of a material which is 

different from the refractory material of the tube portion 
(26). 
Gate closure according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the flange material is a mortar, the granular 

constituents of which have a grain size which is slightly 
smaller than the minimum width of a gap (40) between 

the lateral edges of the gate plate (16) and the 
peripheral edge (44) of the steel frame (22) enclosing 

the flange (28). 
Gate plate closure according to Claim 3,  

 
characterized in that a mortar containing Al
2
O
3
 serves as 
the flange material. 
Gate plate closure according to one of Claims 1 - 
4, characterized in that an Al
2
O
3
, MgO or similar 
casting composition serves as the refractory material 

for the tube portion (26) of the pouring-out nozzle 
(20).
