<ABSTRACT>
The present invention enlarges the effective screening area of a CRT for projecting 
while maintaining the strength of the panel (11) necessary to allow for normal usage 

without breaking. The inside portion of the effective screening area (A2) inside the 
rectangular display area (14) is of a predetermined radius, and protrudes inward, 

extending in all directions. The four corners (H) of the display area (14) are outside of 
the circular boundary line (31) comprised of the standard thickness (Tf). Non-screening 

areas (H) which are outside the boundary line (31) are flat or protuberant, and have a 
thickness greater than the standard thickness (Tf). Accordingly, with the present 

invention, the effective screening area (A2) can be made larger than previous effective 
screening areas (A1) in the prior art, which could not extend beyond a border that 

included the four corners, while maintaining overall the necessary strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a projection television CRT (cathode-ray tube), the CRT having a
panel which is convex on the inside (a panel display).FIG. 1 illustrates a projector in the related art. In a typical rear projector 1, a video
image displayed on a CRT for projecting 2 is magnified by a lens 3, reflected from a
mirror 4, and projected onto a screen 5. As shown in FIG. 2, the CRT for projecting 2
comprises a glass tube 10 for displaying the video image, an electron gun 21 built into
the glass tube 10, a deflection yoke 22, and so on.The glass tube 10 consists of a panel 11 which is rectangular in shape in front having
a display area 14 onto the inside of which a phosphor is coated, and a funnel 12. A frit
seal 13 is welded between the panel 11 and the funnel 12 so that the glass tube 10 is
closed tightly. The electron gun 21 mounted in the neck 12A of the funnel 12 emits an
electron beam, corresponding to a video signal, which is deflected by the deflection yoke
22 and scanned horizontally and vertically so as to be projected onto the phosphor inside
the display area 14. In such fashion, the video image is displayed in the display area 14.The panel 11 is either a panel 11 convex on the inside, as illustrated in FIG. 3A, or a
panel 11a flat on the inside, as illustrated in FIG. 3B. The inside portion of the display
area 14 of the panel 11 convex on the inside protrudes inward in an arc shape, extending
in all directions with a predetermined radius R1 of, for example, approximately 350 mm.
In other words, the inside portion of the display area 14 is a part of a spherical surface.
On the other hand, with the panel 11a, the inside portion of the display area 14 is flat on
the inside.In the case of the panel 11 convex on the inside, the thickness T1 of the center of the
display area 14 is fixed based on optical conditions, and the thickness T2 of the
peripheral area surrounding the display area 14 must be set at a greater thickness than the
standard thickness Tf of, for example, 5 to 6 mm. In this way, the size of the effective
screening area of the display area in which the video image is normally displayed is
restricted.On the other hand, the recent CRTs for projecting require high luminance and high
resolution and it has become necessary to enlarge the effective screening area A1.
However, as described above, the restriction on the display size causes difficulties.Although it is possible to widen the effective screening area A1 while maintaining the
standard thickness Tf by increasing the radius R1
