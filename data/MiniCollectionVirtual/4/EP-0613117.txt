<ABSTRACT>
In a dumb terminal (103) to which an auxiliary 
device (109) may be attached, improvements in 

display definition, and in character 
generation memory. In the area of display 

definition, pages (801) may be mapped onto the 
terminal's display memory (213) and viewports 

(811) may be mapped onto pages. Page and 
viewport definition are independent of each 

other and settable modes (623) permit a viewport 
to follow the active position. In the area of 

transfer of data, the source of data for the 
host computer and the destination of data from 

the host computer may be specified 
independently. Improvements in flow control 

ensure that the host computer can always change 
the destination of data and gain control of the 

terminal. Improvements in access control ensure 
that neither the terminal nor the auxiliary 

device can monopolize transfer between it and 
the host. Moreover, transfer can proceed 

transparently even when non-ASCII 8-bit codes or 
a 7-bit host-terminal link are involved. 

Finally, a protocol (1501) permits one portion 
of character generation memory to be copied to 

another portion thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to digital data and word processing systems and more
particularly to a display apparatus having a display memory divisible into
a plurality of display positions.One of the most common varieties of prior-art terminal is the "dumb" terminal.
A "dumb" terminal is so called because it performs no local processing
of data beyond what is required to receive the data in the terminal and
provide it to a digital computer or to receive the data from the digital
computer and display it on the terminal screen. Communication between the
"dumb" terminal and the digital computer is by means of protocols. Different
protocols specify the data transferred between the digital computer and
the terminal, permit the digital computer to control the operation of the
terminal, and indicate the state of the terminal to the digital computer.
A common class of "dumb" terminals is made up of ANSI standard terminals
which are controlled by means of protocols compatible with the ANSI X3.4,
X3.41, and X3.64 standards.As microprocessors, display controllers, and memory have dropped in cost
and grown in speed and power, the "dumb" terminals have become "smarter".
An example of such a "smart" "dumb" terminal is the IBM 3163. This and
similar ANSI standard terminals now have sufficient display memory to hold
more than one terminal screen's worth of data. In such terminals, the
display memory is divided into pages and a user of the terminal can specify
which page of display memory is to be displayed. The 3163 and others of
these terminals also permit the terminal screen to be divided into viewports.
A viewport is a "window" onto a page, and consequently, a terminal
with viewports can display data from more than one page simultaneously. A military terminal designed to hold up to 7 separate items of text in
areas referred to as "windows" is described in AFIPS Conference Proceedings
- 1979 National Computer Conference, Vol. 48, 4 June 1979 New York, pages
855 - 861. The windows are allocated and deallocated by a host computer.
Several windows can be placed on the screen at the same time, and the
windows can be scrolled independently. In this system the text is stored
in what is referred to as "domains". A domain is an "atomic unit" for the
communication of text between the host and the terminal. Each window is
made up of a contiguous string of domains wherein a given domain may have
any length up to 100 characters. The terminal is optimized to operate on
the fixed length domains. The domains can expand and contract, and

<CLAIMS>
A display apparatus having a display memory (213) divisible
into a plurality of display positions (803) given by a

product of rows and columns of character positions and an
output device (211) for outputting a display divisible into a

plurality of display lines (809), characterized by:

means (921) for defining at least one page (801), the at
least one page including a specified set of the display positions

(803) ;
means (907) for defining at least one viewport (811) on the
output device, the at least one viewport including a specified

set of the display lines (809) ;
means (905) for establishing a correspondence between a member
of the set of display positions corresponding to the at

least one page and a member of the set of display lines corresponding
to a viewport that is currently assigned to the at

least one page; and
means for outputting (1003) on each display line the contents
of any corresponding display positions, and when the correspondence

establishing means has established that no correspondence
exists between any member of the set of display positions

and a given member of the set of display lines, for
outputting certain display data on the given member of the

set of display lines,
wherein the at least one page and the at least one viewport
can be defined independently of each other,
and wherein a given one of the viewports may be assigned to
any one of the pages and subsequently at least one of automatically

repositioned within an assigned page or automatically
reassigned to another one of the pages.
The display apparatus of claim 1 connectable to a computer
system (101) and responding to members of a set of protocols

received therefrom; characterized in that:

the means (921) for defining at least one page (801) defines a
plurality of pages and defines a given one of the pages in

response to a define page protocol (1213)
which specifies the set of display positions;
the means for defining at least one viewport defines a plurality
of viewports in response to a define viewports protocol

(1209) which specifies the sets of display
lines in the plurality of viewports; and
the means for establishing a correspondence establishes a
correspondence between the set of display positions belonging

to a given one of the pages and the set of display lines
belonging to a given one of the viewports and between the set

of display positions belonging to the given page and the set of
display lines belonging to the given viewport in response to an

assign page to viewport protocol specifying the given page, the
given viewport, and the correspondence between the respective set of

display positions and the respective set of display lines.
The display apparatus of claim 2 characterized in that
it further includes means (1101) for specifying a certain

display position as the active position (815), the page to
which the certain display position belongs as the active page

(819), and any viewport which is assigned to the active page
and for which there is a correspondence between the active

position and the viewport's set of display lines as the active
viewport (821); and

the means for establishing a correspondence responds to a
specification of the active position at a display position in

the active page for which there is no correspondence with the 
viewport's set of display lines by establishing a new correspondence

between display positions and display lines in the active
viewport such that there is a correspondence between the active

position and a display line in the active viewport.
The display apparatus means of claim 2 characterized in
that it further includes means (1101) for specifying an active

position (815) of the display positions and an active viewport
of (821) the viewports; and

that the means for establishing a correspondence responds to a
specification of the active position on another page by establishing

a correspondence between the active viewport and the
page currently containing the active position.
The display apparatus of claim 1 characterized in that,
for the case where a given one of the viewports is

automatically reassigned to another one of the pages, a
viewport that is assigned to the another one of the pages is

automatically deassigned.
