<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control device and method for
controlling a fuel injection timing for use in an internal
combustion engine, and particularly to control device and method
for controlling a fuel injection timing to a proper timing
irrespective of variations of engine driving conditions, such as
variation of viscosity of fuel, by detecting a lift timing of a
needle valve for a fuel injection nozzle and determining a target
lift timing.In an internal combustion engine such as a diesel engine,
fuel is forcedly fed from a fuel injection pump to a fuel
injection nozzle at a controlled timing within a rotational
period of an engine while pressurized by the fuel injection pump.
When the fuel is fed into the fuel injection nozzle, a needle
valve which is urged by a spring is pushed (lifted) up by the
pressure of the fuel itself to open a fuel injection port,
whereby the fuel is injected through the fuel injection port into
a combustion chamber.Such a fuel injection mechanism is generally provided with
a fuel injecting timing control device for detecting a lift
timing of a needle valve and performing a feedback control so 
that the detected lift timing is coincident with a target lift
timing which is beforehand determined, as disclosed in
EP-A-0 078 987 (compare with the first part of the independent claims).The conventional fuel injection timing control device as
described above is equipped with a sensor for detecting the lift
motion of the needle valve, and a start timing of the lift of
the needle valve, that is, a start timing of the fuel injection
is detected on the basis of an output signal from the sensor.
Further, the fuel injection timing control device is equipped
with a map containing various fuel injection timings which are
optimally determined in accordance with various loads (injection
amounts) and rotating numbers of the engine in advance. In a
driving condition, a fuel injection timing which is optimal to
the driving condition (load, rotating number) is read out from
the map, and the read-out timing is used as a target fuel
injection timing. The timing of the forced fuel feeding of the
fuel injection pump is controlled so that the detected lift start
timing of the needle valve is coincident with the target fuel
injection timing.In the conventional fuel injection control device as
described above, if any engine driving condition, particularly
viscosity of fuel, is varied, excess and deficiency would occur
in a spark advance for the fuel injection timing, resulting in
aggravation of noises,
