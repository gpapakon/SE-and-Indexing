<ABSTRACT>
Flexible couplings of disc-type construction in accordance with the prior art are designed as hydraulic vibration dampers which exhibit uniform damping even at high speeds of rotation. According to the invention, additional throttling cross-sections (13) are provided, and assigned to these are throttle valves (14,15,16) operated by centrifugal force which open at high coupling speeds of rotation. Use in the drive line of motor vehicles.

Disc coupling with a first coupling half in the form of a central disc fitted on a 
hub, and with a second coupling half which comprises two side discs that 

enclose the central disc to form a filling space for a damping fluid, whereby 
radial recesses around an outer circumference of the central disc and radial 

projections on the side disc are in active engagement with one another to form 
throttle cross-sections for the damping of rotational oscillations, characterized 

in that additional throttle cross-sections (13) are provided, with which throttle 
valves (14, 15, 16) are associated, the said valves opening in a centrifugal 

force dependent way at high revolution speeds of the coupling. 
Disc coupling according to Claim 1, characterized in that in at least one 
projection (6) that divides the corresponding recess (5) into two displacement 

chambers (7, 8), an overflow channel (13) which connects the two 
displacement chambers (7, 8) to one another is provided, in which a 

centrifugal force dependent throttle valve (14, 15, 16) is fitted. 
Disc coupling according to Claim 2, characterized in that as a centrifugal 
force dependent throttle valve, a valve ball (15) that can move radially and 

which is spring-loaded radially inwards by a compression spring (16) is 
provided. 
Disc coupling according to Claim 3, characterized in that the mass of the 
valve ball (15) and the spring force of the compression spring (16) are 

matched to one another such that at high revolution speeds, the centrifugal 
force acting on the valve ball (15) is greater than the spring force exerted by 

the compression spring (16).
