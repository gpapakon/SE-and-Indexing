<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aeration grid comprising a chassis (1) having the general shape of a frame, constituted by lateral uprights provided with an internal groove (4), connected by crosspieces, and modular elements consisting of strips (2) held assembled in grating form on the inside of said chassis (1). According to the invention, the chassis is lined internally by the successive stacking of the strips (2) held on the interior of the chassis (1) by distance pieces (3) fixed by catching on the ends of each strip (2), said stackable distance pieces (3) being locked elastically between the front edge (4a) and the rear edge (4b) of the grooves (4) made in the lateral uprights of said chassis (1) at the time of the insertion of the strip (2) into the chassis.
