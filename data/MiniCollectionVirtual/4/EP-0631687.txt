<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nuclear
gauges for making measurements of traveling webs in
continuous sheet-making systems.In continuous sheet-making systems, on-line
measurements are highly desirable. The on-line
measurements can provide, for instance, early
indications of upsets in process conditions, thus
allowing process controls to be effected before
substantial quantities of substandard material are
produced. In practice, however, accurate on-line
measurements are difficult to make. The measurement
difficulties arise, in part, because modern sheet-making
machines are large and operate at high speeds.
Some paper-making machines, for example, produce paper
webs that are 100 to 400 inches (2.5 to 10.0 meters)
wide at rates of up to 100 feet (30 meters) per second.For making on-line measurements of properties
of traveling webs in continuous sheet-making systems,
it is common to employ sensors that periodically
traverse, or scan, the webs. One type of scanning
sensor is the nuclear gauge. In operation, nuclear
gauges direct nuclear radiation (beta rays) against a
surface of a traveling web while detecting the absorbed
(or transmitted) radiation. (The quantity of nuclear
radiation absorbed over a given area is a measure of
the basis weight of the absorbing material.) Nuclear 
scanning gauges typically use radioactive krypton gas
as the beta ray source.When using nuclear gauges, safety is a major
concern. For safety reasons, it is important that
nuclear sources are appropriately shielded, especially
when not in use, to prevent accidental exposure of
personnel who might be working near the gauge. In
conventional practice, shielding of a nuclear gauge is
accomplished by mounting the nuclear source material in
a protective housing that has a shuttered window. When
the nuclear gauge is in use, the shuttered window is
opened to allow radiation to be emitted onto a
traveling web. When the gauge is not in use, the
shuttered window is closed, thus blocking radiation and
reducing the opportunities for accidental exposure.Although shielding of nuclear gauges is
necessary, the design of the shielding must not impair
the accuracy of measurements that are made by the
gauge. A nuclear gauge of the kind set out in the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US-A-3.085.157.The present invention, generally speaking,
provides a nuclear gauge for making measurements of
traveling webs in continuous sheet-making systems,
having an enclosure means, with a cylindrical cavity
formed in the enclosure means, an aperture formed

<CLAIMS>
A nuclear gauge (7) for making measurements of traveling webs (11) in continuous
sheet-making systems, having an enclosure means (20), with a cylindrical cavity (15) formed in the

enclosure means, an aperture (16) formed through the enclosure means in a direction that intersects
the cylindrical cavity, a wheel-like member (10) rotatably mounted in the cavity, an encapsulat
ed
nuclear source (28) mounted to be carried by the wheel-like member, and rotating means (71) for

rotating the wheel-like member (10) between a first position whereat the nuclear
source can emit radiation directly through the aperture onto a web that travels past the aperture and a second position,

characterized by a fire pin means (80) for retuming the wheel-like member (10) to the second
position in the event of a fire.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 1 wherein, at the second position, the
encapsulated nuclear source is positioned to face a sidewall of the enclosure means at a location

remote from the first position.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 1 wherein the nuclear source (28) comprises
krypton gas.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 1 wherein the rotating means comprises a
pneumatic actuator (71).
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 1 further including a plug (42) of material
having a low atomic number, which plug (42) is mounted in the sidewall of the cavity at the second

position for absorbing beta rays that are emitted from the encapsulated nuclear source (28).
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 5 wherein the low atomic number material
is selected from the group consisting of aluminum, beryllium, carbon and DelrinÂ®. 
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 1 wherein the wheel-like member (10) has
a generally V-shaped slot formed in its periphery, the faces (51,53) of which provide stop faces.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 1 wherein the fire pin means (80) includes a spring-loaded
member (81) which is positioned such that, upon release, it applies pressure against one of

the stop faces (51, 53) of the wheel-like member (10) to force the wheel-like member to rotate to the
second position, thereby reducing the change that radiation will be emitted from the nuclear gauge

in a harmful manner.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 1 wherein the fire pin means (80) includes:

a pin member (81) releasably connected to a housing (82);
means (84) for urging the pin member from the housing toward a stop face (51, 53) on the
wheel-like member (10); and
means (83) for automatically releasing the pin member (81) from the housing (82) toward
the stop face (51, 53) in the event of the fire.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 9 wherein the automatic releasing means (83)
includes a melting connector.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim 10 wherein the melting connector (83)
includes solder.
A nuclear gauge (7) according to claim I wherein:

the enclosure means (20) is formed from a material having a high atomic number; and 
at the second position of the rotating means (10), the encapsulated nuclear source (28) is
positioned to face a wall of the enclosure.
