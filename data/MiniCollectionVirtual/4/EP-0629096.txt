<ABSTRACT>
A radio system which is arranged to operate in accordance 
with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, wherein at 

least one time slot in each frame is designated for the 
transmission of access contention data, which time slot includes a 

first field reserved for data specifying the number of information 
slots required by a sub-unit, and which system includes a base 

station adapted for operation such that consequent upon receipt of 
data in the said reserved field, the base station is arranged to 

respond by allocating available slots to satisfy the requirement of 
the sub-unit, characterised in that the said designated time slot is 

arranged additionally to include a further field reserved for a flag 
which when it is present, indicates to the base station that the 

sub-unit requires the substantially permanent allocation of the 
said information slots.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellular mobile radio systems and 
more especially, although not exclusively, it relates to an 
improvement in or modification of a cellular mobile radio system 
arranged to operate in accordance with the packet reservation 
multiple access protocol which forms the subject of our co-pending 
GB Patent Application No 9219824.1. Although the 
invention is primarily intended for incorporation in digital cellular 
mobile radio communication systems, it may also find application 
in wireless local area networks. According to our co-pending patent application, a cellular 
mobile radio system is provided which is arranged to operate in 
accordance with a packet reservation multiple access protocol, 
wherein at least one time slot in each frame is designated for the 
transmission of access contention data which time slot includes a 
field reserved for data specifying a number of information slots 
required by a mobile unit, which system includes a base station 
adapted for operation such that consequent upon receipt of data 
in the said reserved field, the base station is arranged to respond 
by allocating available slots to satisfy the requirement of the 
mobile unit. One important advantage of this system, as will be 
appreciated by those skilled in the art, is that since only one 
access contention request is required irrespective of the number 
of information slots required, the access contention time required  
 
to reserve capacity will be minimised or at least substantially 
reduced as compared with a system in which each individual slot 
must be contended for. Although the system is an improvement 
over hitherto known arrangements, in that the access contention 
time is reduced in order to provide for transmission from the 
mobile in the slots allocated by the base station, there may be 
occasions when a dedicated substantially permanent allocation of 
capacity is also or alternatively required. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
a modified system wherein, although improved access contention 
is provided for in accordance with our co-pending patent 
application, it is still never the less additionally possible, when 
required, to provide for the dedicated substantially permanent 
allocation of communication capacity. According to the present invention we provide a radio 
system which is arranged to operate in accordance with a packet 
reservation multiple access protocol, wherein at least one time slot 
in each frame is designated for the

A radio system which is arranged to operate in accordance

first field reserved for data specifying the number of information

which when it is present, indicates to the base station that the 

sub-unit requires the substantially permanent allocation of the 
said information slots. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the flag comprises 
an additional data bit or bits. 
A system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the radio 
system is a cellular mobile radio system, wherein the sub-unit is a 

mobile unit and wherein the time slot which includes the first and 
further fields also includes a mobile unit address field. 
A cellular mobile radio system as claimed in claim 3, 
wherein the system is arranged such that consequent upon the 

 
substantially permanent allocation of a slot or slots for 

information, further information slots are thereafter additionally 
contended for when required. 
A cellular mobile radio system as claimed in claim 4, 
wherein after reservation of a slot on a substantially permanent 

basis and after the reserved slot has not been used for a 
predetermined period, the base station is arranged to interrogate 

the mobile to determine whether reservation is still required.
