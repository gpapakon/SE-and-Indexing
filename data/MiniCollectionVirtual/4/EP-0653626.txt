<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an inspection 
system for transparently taking an image of inside of a 

semiconductor device to analyze anomalous occurrence. 
First, image data obtained under infrared ray 

illumination are converted into a first left-to-right 
reversed image data in which the obtained image data 

are reversed left to right and the first left-to-right 
reversed image data are stored. Next, very weak light 

emitted from an anomalous portion when the 
semiconductor device is biased is picked up under no 

illumination. Then, image data of very weak light is 
converted into a second left-to-right reversed image 

data in which the image data of weak light are reversed 
left to right. The first and second left-to-right 

image data are superimposed to superimpose the image 
specifying the anomalous location on an image of chip 

patterns in the semiconductor device and the 
superimposed image is displayed. Further, in the 

infrared-ray epi-irradiation means, an optical filter 
made of the same material as that of the semiconductor 

device to be measured is used to form infrared rays for 
illumination, so that when the back surface of the 

semiconductor device is irradiated with infrared rays 
produced by the optical filter, light having a short 

wavelength which is easily reflected on the surface of  
 

the semiconductor device is interrupted and infrared 
rays having high transmittance against the 

semiconductor device can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inspection system for
semiconductor devices. Such an inspection system is used for analyzing
anomalous occurrences inside a semiconductor device and for evaluating
reliability of a semiconductor device. Such an inspection system is also
used for transparently taking an image of inside of a semiconductor device.As a semiconductor device is highly integrated, e.g., VLSI, difficulty
of anomaly analysis and reliability evaluation of internal circuits of the
semiconductor device is increased.In such present condition, much attention is focused on the analysis
technology to track down the location of an anomalous portion by detecting
very weak light emitted from the anomalous portion in semiconductor
device. An emission microscope is known as a semiconductor device
inspection apparatus utilizing such analysis technology.The emission microscope picks up with high sensitivity very weak
light caused by hot carriers, which are produced when an electric field is 
concentrated on an anomalous portion in semiconductor
device, or very weak light in the infrared region
caused by latchup. Therefore, the emission microscope
can measure a semiconductor device to be checked
without contact and with high accuracy.However, the emission microscope has such a
problem that since it detects emitted light in the
visible to infrared region, it could become incapable
of measuring emitted light if there would exist some
shielding object between an anomalous portion emitting
very weak light and the emission microscope.In particular, in order to make a semiconductor
device being highly integrated, semiconductor devices
tend to employ the chip structure in which
interconnection between numerous elements such as
transistors is made by multilayer wiring located on the
top surface. The multilayer wiring interrupts the very
weak light caused by an anomaly of an element
underneath the multilayer wiring, which caused a
problem of inability of measurement or not permitting
high-accuracy measurement. Also, a semiconductor
device to which the packaging structure as called as
Lead On Chip is applied has such an arrangement that a
lead frame covers the top surface of semiconductor
chip. Thus, similarly to the case of the multilayer
wiring, the lead frame will be a shielding object and 
interrupt the very weak light, resulting in inability
of measurement or not permitting high-accuracy
measurement.Further, there is another problem in applications
of the emission microscope. For example, it is known
as an
