<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel curable composition
and more particularly to a curable composition providing a
cured product having a silicon type interpenetrating
polymer network (hereinafter referred to as IPN).In particularly, it relates to a curable composition
comprising properly selected components so as to provide a
cured product having a silicon type IPN composed of a silicic
acid skeleton and a silicon-containing polymer, e.g.,
polycarbosilane or polysiloxane.Addition reaction of a compound having an Si-H bond to
an olefin bond (or an acetylene bond) is known as a
hydrosilylation reaction. Hydrosilylation of an olefin bond
may be explained with referring to the following reaction
scheme:
The above-mentioned mode of reaction occurs even in the
absence of a catalyst or under irradiation of γ-rays or
ultraviolet rays or in the presence of a radical generator or
in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, such as a
platinum compound (e.g., chloroplatinic acid) or a rhodium
compound. Hydrosilylation can be utilized as a curing system
of a curable composition. For example, reaction between a 
compound having a plurality of Si-H bonds and a compound having
a plurality of olefin bond-containing substituents gives a
cured product.It is well known in the art that a siloxane bond is
formed by hydrolysis and condensation of a silicon compound
having an alkoxy group as shown by the following reaction
scheme:
2≡SiOR + H2O → ≡SiOSi≡ + 2ROH
For example, hydrolysis and condensation of a polyfunctional
alkoxy-containing silicon compound or a halogen-containing
silicon compound produce organopolysiloxane,
organopolysesquisiloxane or silica, which is useful as grease,
oil, heat-resistant varnish, insulating varnish, an insulating
protective film for semiconductor bases or silica gel.It is possible to simultaneously build up a silicon-containing
polymer having excellent toughness, moldability and
thermal stability and a silicic acid network skeleton having
excellent rigidity, environmental resistance and non-combustible
properties in the same system by the reaction among
a polyfunctional Si-H bond-containing compound, a double bond-containing
silicon compound, and an alkoxy-containing silicon
compound. The reaction product is a highly rigid, light
constructional material excellent in heat resistance in which
the silicon-containing polymer and the silicic acid network
skeleton seem to form interpenetrating polymer network. However, when hydrosilylation and hydrolysis-condensation
of an alkoxysilyl group are
