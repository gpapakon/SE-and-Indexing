<ABSTRACT>
In a hydrocyclone plant for treating fibre suspensions comprising a multiplicity of hydrocyclone bodies (1) each hydrocyclone body is mounted in a hole in a wall (5) and is sealed to the wall with the aid of a sealing ring (18). According to the invention the sealing ring is made of an inexpensive chemical resistant material and is radially cut through to form two free ends on the sealing ring. The hydrocyclone body is provided with a sealing surface (12) having a radial extension which increases along the hydrocyclone body. Axially along the sealing surface (12) a projection (22) extends between the free ends of the sealing ring. When mounting the hydrocyclone body the sealing ring (18) is adapted to be entrained by the wall (5) along the sealing surface (12), so that the sealing ring is expanded and seals between the sealing surface and the wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrocyclone plant 
for treating fibre suspensions comprising a multiplicity 
of elongated hydrocyclone bodies, each of which has an 
apex end and a base end, and has an exterior 
sealing surface having a circular cross-section. 
In the hydrocyclone plant there is a wall provided with 
circular holes, into which the respective hydrocyclones 
are inserted, so that the sealing surfaces extend 
through the holes. Circular sealing rings extend around 
the respective sealing surfaces and are situated in the 
holes of the wall to seal between the sealing surfaces 
and the wall. Such a hydrocyclone plant is known 
from EP-A-0 109 764. In conventional hydrocyclone plants of this kind the 
sealing rings are made of an elastic rubber compound 
having a relatively poor resistance to the chemicals 
which can be found in the fibre suspensions. 
Thus, the chemicals can affect the sealing 
rings of rubber, so that they become hard or are 
dissolved, which has the consequence that the seal 
between the sealing surfaces of the hydrocyclone bodies 
and said wall becomes unreliable. In addition, depending 
on the kind of chemicals present, the sealing rings of rubber 
can swell, so that the hydrocyclone bodies become 
jammed in the wall, which makes it difficult to dismount 
the individual hydrocyclone bodies. It is true that the sealing rings could be made of 
existing chemical resistant rubber compounds, whereby the 
problem of unreliable sealing or jamming of the hydrocyclone 
bodies could be eliminated. However, such 
chemical resistant rubber compounds are too expensive to 
justify their use in a hydrocyclone plant, which may  
 
comprise hundreds of hydrocyclone bodies, each of which 
requires two sealing rings. It is the aim of the present invention is to provide a 
hydrocyclone plant, in which the required seals between 
hydrocyclone bodies and walls are reliable, and in which 
the hydrocyclone bodies do not get stuck in the 
walls, without making the plant more expensive than 
conventional plants. With this aim in view the present invention provides 
a hydrocyclone plant 
of the kind described initially, which is characterized 
in that - a) each sealing ring is radially cut through 
to form two opposite free ends on the sealing ring as 
seen in the circumferential direction of the sealing 
ring, the sealing ring being stiff enough to prevent 
lateral disengagement of the sealing ring from a hydrocyclone body 
on which it is mounted, when the hydrocyclone 
body is not connected

<CLAIMS>
A hydrocyclone plant for treating fibre suspensions 
comprising a multiplicity of elongated hydrocyclone 

bodies (1), each of which has an apex end (3), a base 
end (2), and an exterior sealing 

surface (12,23) having a circular cross-section, a wall 
(4,5) provided with circular holes, into which the 

respective hydrocyclone bodies are inserted, so that the 
sealing surfaces extend through the holes, and circular 

sealing rings (18,24) extending around the respective 
sealing surfaces and situated in the holes of the wall 

to seal between the sealing surfaces and the wall,
characterized in
 that 

each sealing ring (18,24) is radially cut through to 
form two opposite free ends (19,20) on the sealing 

ring as seen in the circumferential direction of the 
sealing ring, the sealing ring being stiff enough to 

prevent lateral disengagement of the sealing ring from a 
hydrocyclone body (1) on which it is mounted, when 

the hydrocyclone body is not connected to the wall 
(4,5), 
the radius of the sealing surface (12,23) of each hydrocyclone 
body (1) increases 

along the sealing surface in the direction towards 
the base end (2) of the hydrocyclone body and the sealing surface 

(12,23) is 
provided with a projection (22,27) extending axially 

along the sealing surface between the free ends 
(19,20) of the sealing ring (18,24) extending around the sealing 

surface, 
each sealing ring (18,24) is dimensioned to be 
insertable into any selected one of the holes of the  

 
wall (4,5) with the sealing ring situated at a 

first position on its sealing surface (12,23), and 
to be expanded by the sealing surface to seal between 

the wall and the sealing surfaced when the sealing 
ring is inserted in the selected hole of the 

wall and is situated at a second position on the 
sealing surface, at which the sealing surface has a 

greater diameter than at said first position, and 
each sealing ring (18,24) is provided with a 
radially outwardly directed stop member (21), which 

is adapted to abut against the wall (4,5), so that 
the sealing ring is displaced by the wall from said 

first position to said second position, when the 
sealing ring is inserted into the selected
 hole 
of the wall and the hydrocyclone body (1) on which 

the sealing ring is mounted is advanced, with its 
apex end (3) leading, through said hole in the wall.

ends (19,20) of the sealing ring (18,24) on the sealing 
surface, when the sealing ring is in said second 

position and is expanded by the sealing surface.
