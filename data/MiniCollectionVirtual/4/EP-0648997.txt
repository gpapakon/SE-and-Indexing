<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a high-energy fuse device of the type comprising, connected in series in a looped circuit, an energy-storage capacitor (1), means (2) for controlling the discharge of the capacitor and a high-energy detonator (3) triggered by the discharge of the capacitor. According to the invention, the capacitor (1) is a cylinder of axis X, X', comprising an axial recess (10), within which the control means are placed. Moreover, the detonator possesses a coaxial structure of axis XX' substantially aligned with the axis X1 X'1 and is connected to the control means by the intermediary of an electrical connection parallel to the axis X1 X'1. The device according to the invention occupies a small volume and, by virtue of its modular structure, has connections which are simple to make. Such a device can be used as a detonator for military charges or as an igniter for a gas generator.
