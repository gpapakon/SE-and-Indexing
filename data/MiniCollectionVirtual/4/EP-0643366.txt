<ABSTRACT>
To produce an electronic module having an integrated circuit, a standardised initial product is provided, consisting of an insulating substance which is provided with a conductive coating. Contact areas are constructed in the conductive coating by means of interruptions. With the aid of a milling tool, cutouts are introduced into the insulating layer of the initial product, through which cutouts conductive connections between contact surfaces and the integrated circuit are later led. The position of the cutouts is matched to the size of the integrated circuit to be incorporated into the electronic module.
