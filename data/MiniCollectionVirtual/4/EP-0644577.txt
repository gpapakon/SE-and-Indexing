<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a 
method of plasma treatment in which wafer temperature control 

is easily performed and the structure of electrode is 
simplified. On etching treatment of a wafer, firstly the 

pressure inside the etching treatment chamber is controlled 
to a certain pressure, for example above 10 Torr, by means of 

pumping while the process gas or thermal conductive gas is 
being introduced into the etching treatment chamber. In this 

environment, the wafer is mounted on an electrostatic adhering 
electrode and is electrostatically adhered. The process gas 

having pressure of approximately 10 Torr is enclosed in the 
space (reservoir) from the grooves on the electrostatic 

adhering electrode to the gaps between the wafer lift-up pin. 
Then, the pressure inside the etching treating chamber is 

controlled to the etching treating pressure, and etching 
treatment is performed. The process gas enclosed in the 

reservoir contributes to cooling of the wafer. After the 
completion of treatment, the process gas in the reservoir is 

exhausted with a vacuum pump, the wafer is removed from the 
electrostatic adhering electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method 
for treating a wafer, such as treating a wafer with plasma, 
in a reduced pressure environment, wherein it is easy to perform 
temperature control of the wafer and which is suitable 
for a simplified electrode construction. Treating a wafer in a reduced pressure environment is 
a widely used technique in semiconductor chip production. 
A great variety of apparatus and methods are known to achieve 
such wafer treatment. A first category of prior art proposes an electrostatic 
wafer holder for wafer cooling during plasma treating or reactive 
ion etching, as described, for example, in the IBM 
Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 31, No. 1, June 1988, 
pp. 462-464, or in the JP Patent Publications No. 56-53853 
(1981) and 57-44747 (1982). The wafer is electrostatically 
adhered to a pedestal having an electrostatic adhering electrode, 
and at the same time cooled by supplying helium gas 
to the backside surface of the wafer for cooling the wafer 
during treatment. A second category of prior art proposes to mechanically 
hold the wafer on a pedestal using a clamp during processing 
while the wafer is being cooled by introducing helium gas  
 
on the bottom surface of the wafer with heat conduction, as 
described, for example, in the EP Patent Application No. 
469 469, and JP Patent Publication No. 2-27778 (1990) and JP 
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2-30128 (1990). EP-A-469 469 
also describes an electrode whose surface is coated with 
an anodic oxide film of about 10 to 200 µm, and then further 
covered with an elastic insulating film of about 25 to 100 µm 
thickness, such as polyimide resin film, capton film or the 
like using acrylic adhesive (thickness of 10 to 15 µm). The 
purpose of covering the electrode with the elastic insulating 
film is for keeping the impedance between the wafer and the 
electrode constant. A third category of prior art proposes a wafer cooling 
apparatus wherein a pedestal disposed within the treatment 
chamber receives the wafer which is lowered mechanically onto 
an upper surface of the pedestal. This upper surface of the 
pedestal is grooved to allow gas trapped between the wafer 
and the pedestal surface to escape around the periphery of 
the wafer, thereby minimizing the tendency of tne wafer to 
"skate" across the surface of the pedestal on a thin layer 
of gas. Gas which is trapped between the wafer and the pedestal 
is forced into the grooves of the pedestal. Such an 
apparatus is described, for example, in the
