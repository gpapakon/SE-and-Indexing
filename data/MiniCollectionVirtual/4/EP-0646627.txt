<ABSTRACT>
Polymer blends based on 6 polyamide and at least 
one ultra low density polyethylene (ULDPE), suitably 

modified by functional group grafting, result to be 
suitable for applications in which good 

processability, good mechanical characteristics and 
excellent impact strength, also at low temperatures, 

are required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymeric 
compositions essentially constituted by 6 polyamide 
and containing at least one ultra low density 
polyethylene (ULDPE; d < 0.900 g/cm³), suitably 
modified by grafting with unsaturated monomeric 
compounds containing functional groups of acidic or 
anhydride type, or their derivatives. The present invention also relates to the use of 
such compositions in order to manufacture parts 
displaying high impact strength both immediately after 
moulding, and at low temperatures, with their 
resilience values undergoing very small changes as the 
moisture content in the polymer varies. It is known that polyamides in general and 
polycaprolactam in particular show low impact strength 
immediately after moulding, with this property being 
recovered over time owing to the progressive water 
absorption in the polymer. If, on the one hand, this 
feature, i.e., the capability of absorbing water, 
might be regarded as being a favourable property 
because, as said, it causes an increase to take place 
in impact strength values, on the other hand it may 
also prevent moulded pieces from being immediately 
used unless they are preliminarily submitted to 
further treatments (forced water absorption, also said 
"conditioning process"). Furthermore, water absorption 
is a characteristic displayed by all polyamides, which  
 
causes, as time goes on, a decrease in stiffness and 
permanent set values. Another unfavourable consequence of water 
absorption is the progressive decrease in impact 
strength displayed over time by the manufactured 
pieces based on polyamides ("nylons"), aboveall at low 
temperatures. From the prior art, a number of methods are 
known, which were proposed in the past in order to 
obviate the above drawbacks. For example, a large number of methods were 
proposed which use different rubbers (EPR, EPDM, and 
so forth), which are capable of modifying polyamides 
behaviour; according to EP patent application No. 
0 157 984, such a modification was undertaken by using 
a low density ethylene polymer (LLDPE) grafted with 
maleic anhydride; however, it was blended with a glass 
filled 66 polyamide, and, furthermore, no mention is 
made of the changes in mechanical characteristics with 
varying LLDPE density. According to US 4,299,744, such a result is 
accomplished by adding particular polyesters, 
ionomeric resins and other aminic compounds or amino 
acids, to the polyamides. US 5,180,788 discloses the use of an LLDPE 
polyethylene modified with a styrene-maleic
