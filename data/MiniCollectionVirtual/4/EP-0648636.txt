<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rubber bearing (1) for locating a retaining rod fixed to a silencer in a locating hole (14), with metal angle brackets (6) fixed to the motor vehicle, to which brackets a pin (5) is fixed, which passes through the rubber material in an area which is remote from the locating hole, the locating hole being formed by a rubber bushing (10), which is arranged with its movement limited in a recess (8) of the rubber bearing, the recess (8) forming a free space around the rubber bushing (10), the rubber bushing being supported by at least two arm-shaped, curved webs (12), which with one end are formed on the rubber bushing (10) and with the other end on the outer edge of the recess.

<CLAIMS>
A rubber bearing having a receiving opening disposed on a 
side remote from a motor vehicle for receiving a retaining rod 

attached to an exhaust silencer and having metal angles (6) which 
are attached to the motor vehicle and between which a bolt (5) is 

attached which extends through the rubber material on a side 
adjacent the motor vehicle, wherein the receiving opening (14) is 

formed by a rubber bush (10) which is disposed with provision for 
limited movement in a recess (8) of the rubber bearing, the 

recess (8) forming a free space around the rubber bush (10), 
characterized in that the rubber bush (10) is borne substantially 

perpendicularly to the axis of suspension via at least two arm-shaped 
curved webs (12) which are formed by one end on the rubber 

bush (10) and by the other end on the outer edge (9) of the 
recess (8), and on the side remote from the angles (6) the rubber 

bush (10) is secured by a further web (11) at the edge (9) of the 
rubber bearing (11) which has a larger width than that of the 

arm-shaped webs (12). 
A rubber bearing according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the openings (7) with which the metal angles (6) for attachment 

to the motor vehicle are formed are slots.
