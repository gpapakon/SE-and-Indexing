<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process and system for 
the production of ethanol wherein a microalga capable of 

accumulating starch in the cells thereof is cultured, the 
culture solution containing the grown algal cells is 

concentrated, and ethanol is formed by maintaining the 
resulting slurry in a dark and anaerobic atmosphere while 

keeping its pH in the range of 6.0 to 9.0. This process and 
system can further include additional steps and units for 

subjecting the residual slurry, from which ethanol has been 
separated, to methane fermentation, burning it to generate 

carbon dioxide, and using the carbon dioxide in the microalga 
culturing step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production
of ethanol useful as fuel, raw material for chemical
industry, and the like, by using starch accumulated in
microalgae as the starting material, as well as to the use of a system for
carrying out the process.Conventionally, ethanol is produced by a chemical
synthesis process in which ethanol is synthesized from fossil
resources (e.g., coal and petroleum) via ethylene, or by a
fermentation process in which ethanol is produced from
biomass resources (e.g., cane sugar and corn starch) with the
aid of microorganisms such as molds and yeast.As to biomass materials, some of the microalgae which
are minute photosynthetic organisms typified by Chlorella,
Dunaliella, Chlamydomonas, Scenedesmus, Spirulina and the
like are known to contain a large amount (more than 50% of
the dry weight) of starch and glycogen useful as raw
materials for the production of ethanol, and some processes
for the production of ethanol by using such microalgal starch
as the starting material have been proposed.Conventionally, the production of ethanol by using such 
microalgal starch as the starting material has been carried
out according to the following procedure:In a first step, a microalga is grown by culturing it
photoautotrophically in the presence of light through carbon
dioxide assimilation by photosynthesis, or by culturing it
heterotrophically in the dark and in the presence of organic
materials such as sugars and organic acids.In a second step, since the grown microalga stores
starch mainly in the cells thereof, the starch is released
from the cells with the aid of a mechanical means (e.g.,
ultrasonic or explosive disintegration) or an enzyme for the
dissolution of cell walls. Then, the starch is.separated by
extraction with water or an organic solvent.In a third step, the starch separated by extraction is
hydrolyzed to glucose with the aid of saccharogenic amylase
or the like. This glucose is fermented by the addition of
alcohol yeast and thus converted into ethanol.British patent specification GB 1 493 480 discloses a method of producing ethanol
according the the above-mentioned state of the art. Starch-producing unicellular green
algae are a aerobically cultured in a culture medium containing an organic compound
providing a source of assimilable carbon, a source of assimilable nitrogen and inorganic
salts and other factors necessary for the growth of the algae, rupturing the cellular
material to release intra-cellular starch, saccharifying the starch produced,
