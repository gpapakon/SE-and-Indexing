<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-locking nut
for fastening an eye-glass lens to a frame or the like, to
a nut tightener for tightening or loosening a small nut used
in eye glasses, and to a nut supplier which enables
efficient assembling and repairing of eye glasses using
small-sized plastic nuts.One means of fastening metal members to rimless-type eye
glasses is shown in US-A-2071045 (Searles). In the disclosure
of Searles, the nut includes a bushing which is provided with
a female thread, the size of the thread being smaller than
that of the male threaded pin and the side face of the bushing
being formed with a split. When the pin is screwed into the
bushing, the split widens and the bushing expands, with the
restorative elastic force of the bushing causing its thread
to tightly engage the pin. The frictional force created
between the thread of the bushing and the pin acts to prevent
free rotation of the pin.Another means of fastening lenses of rimless-type eye
glasses to metal members or the like is shown in FIG. 1: 
first, a pair of T-washers 31 are
fitted into a hole 22 formed in a lens 21 from both ends;
and then the lens 21 is attached to a metal member 24 by
means of a small screw 25 and a nut 32. However, since the
simple tightening of the normal metal nut cannot
substantially provide a self-locking effect, the loosening
of the nut will occur during a long period of use. To
prevent this, it is possible to use a double nut and
slightly rotate its inner element in the reverse direction
at the final stage of tightening so as to prevent the
fastening device from loosening, due to the combined effect
of both elements of the double nut. In the case of using 
the double nut, however, a male screw with a long shank
should be used. Moreover, since the double nut consists of
two elements, the fastening device becomes heavier
accordingly, resulting in the overall imbalance and impaired
appearance of eye glasses. Hence, the use of a double nut
is not preferred by eye glasses in which light weight and
good appearance are valuable factors.Furthermore, since it is necessary in rimless-type
eye glasses to fit the T-washers 31 into the hole 22 in the
lens from both ends in order to prevent the breakage of the
lens in time of fastening the screw as described above, a
larger number of parts are used to assemble eye glasses,
which results in reduced assembling efficiency and increased
production cost. In view of the foregoing, there has
conventionally been a demand for a nut for eye glasses which
realizes
