<ABSTRACT>
An image printer includes a negative-film 
projection exposure unit capable of projecting and 

exposing image information of a negative film on to a 
photosensitive material adapted for negative films and 

a positive-film exposure unit capable of exposing 
image information of a positive film on to the 

photosensitive material adapted for negative films.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
printer.As an image printer for exposing a photosensitive
material with an image recorded on a film, there has
been generally used an image printer operable to
project and expose the film image on to the
photosensitive material.The film usually used for such image printer
comprises a negative film. Yet, there sometimes
arises an occasion when an image recorded on a
positive film must be exposed on to the photosensitive
material.In order to cope with such situation, it has been
necessary to prepare not only an image printer charged
with a photosensitive material and processing liquids
for the negative film but also a further image printer 
charged with a photosensitive material and processing liquids for the positive
film. This has been very uneconomical and improvement has been desired in this
respect.DE-A-37 04 052 discloses a device for printing copies on negative photographic
paper departing from either a photographic negative or from a video image
displayed on a catode ray due. This device is not conceived with the specific
purpose of printing negative and positive films on the same negative
photosensitive material typ, the negative films by means of pur optical projecting
elements, the positive films via scanning and electronic reversing means, as
diclosed by the description of the present application.The present invention attends to the above-described state of the art, and a
primary object of this invention is to provide an improved image printer capable
of exposure processing of both a negative film and a positive film, thereby to
reduce the system cost of the image printer.For accomplishing the above-noted object, an image printer, according to the
present invention, comprises the features of independent claim 1.According to the above-described construction, in case image information of a
negative film is to be 
exposed on to the photosensitive material adapted for
negative films, the negative film is charged to the
negative-film projection exposure unit to be exposed
at a high speed. Whereas, in case image information
of a positive film is to be exposed on to the
photosensitive material adapted for negative films,
the positive film is charged to the positive-film
exposure unit so as to be exposed thereby. That is
to say, the image information of either a negative
film or a positive film may be exposed on to the
negative-film photosensitive material.As a result, as the single image printer may cope
with exposures of both a negative film and a positive

<CLAIMS>
An image printer (1) comprising:

a first exposure unit (5) arranged for projecting and
exposing image information of a negative film (2) on to a photosensitive

material (3) adapted for negative films; and
a second exposure unit (6) arranged for exposing image
information on to said photosensitive material (3) adapted

for negative films,
characterized by

a reader means (15) for reading the image information of a positive film and
for converting it into data to be exposed by the second exposure unit

(6).
An image printer as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that

said reader means (15) is adapted to read image information of a film
charged to film feed means (16;M3) for feeding the film to the first

exposure unit (5).
An image printer as defined in claim 1 
characterized in that

it is adapted to be selectable between a
positive film mode in which the image information of a positive film read by

the reader means (15) is converted into image information to be exposed on
to the photosensitive material (3) and a negative film mode in

which the image information of a negative film read by the reader means
(15) is converted into image information to be exposod on to the

negative-film photosensitive material (3).
An image printer as defined in claim 1 
characterized by
transport means (M1,20,21,22,M2) for transporting the photosensitive
material (3) through the first exposure unit (5) and the

second exposure unit (6) ; 
a control unit (7) for controlling operations of the negative-film projection
exposure unit (5), the positive-film exposure unit (6) and of the transport

means (M1,20,21,22,M2); and
instructing means (0) for instructing either a negative film mode or a
positive film mode to the control unit (7);
wherein, with an instruction for the negative film mode, the control unit
(7) effects control operations for causing the photosensitive material (3)

to be exposed at the first exposure unit (5) and with an
instruction for the positive film mode, the control unit (7) effects control

operations for causing the photosensitive material (3) to be exposed at the
second exposure unit (6).
An image printer as defined in claim 4, 
characterized by
detecting means (15) for detecting information about whether the film
charged to the film feed means (16,M3) for feeding a film to the first

exposure unit (5) is a negative film or a positive film,
so that the instructing means (0) selectively provides an instruction for the
negative film mode or the positive film mode based on the information

detected by the detecting means (15).
An image printer as defined in Claim 4 
characterized in that

said reader means (15) is adapted to read image information of a film
charged to film feed means (M1,20,21,22,M2) for feeding the film to the first

exposure unit (5).
An image printer as defined in claim 6 
characterized by

detecting means (15) for detecting information about whether the film
charged to the film feed means (16,M3) for feeding a film to the first

exposure unit (5) is a negative film or a positive film, so that the
instructing means (7) selectively provides an instruction for the negative film

mode or the positive film mode based on the information detected by
the detecting means (15). 
An image printer as defined in claim 7 
characterized in that

it is adapted to be selectable between the
positive film mode in which the image information of a positive film read by

the reader means (15) is converted into image information to be exposed on
to the photosensitive material (3) and the negative film mode

in which the image information of a negative film read by the reader means
(15) is converted into image information to be exposed on to the

photosensitive material (3).
An image printer as defined in claim 1 
characterized in that

said photosensitive material (3) withdrawn from a holder (4) in which the
photosensitive material (3) is stored in a rolled state, is exposed at either

said first exposure unit (5) or said
second exposure unit (6) and then is developed by a developing unit (D), thereafter,

said photosensitive material (3) being cut into a strip including one-frame
amount of image information to be discharged from the printer.
