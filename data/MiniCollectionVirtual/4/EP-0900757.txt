<ABSTRACT>
The assembly has a belt system (20) to take the sections (10) from the folder and move them on at a higher speed. One conveyor belt (30), adjacent to the belt system, takes the transferred sections at a lower speed than the belt system. An initial retainer (31), over the first conveyor, is in rolling contact to bring the speed of the sections to the movement rate of the conveyor. A second conveyor (33), downstream of the first conveyor, takes the transferred printed sections to pass under a second retainer (34) in rolling contact with them to reduce the printed section speed to the conveyor speed.
