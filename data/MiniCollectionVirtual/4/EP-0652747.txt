<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns an oral morphine preparation having essentially complete bioavailability and, for the major part of the dissolution, an essentially zero order and essentially pH independent release of morphine for a period of at least 8 hours, preferably at least 12 hours, during which period less than 100 % is dissolved. In the preparation, the morphine, in the form of an easily soluble salt, is present in combination with a buffering agent in a preparation coated with a diffusion membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a controlled release
morphine preparation. Specifically the invention concerns
a controlled release morphine oral preparation for
once daily administration especially in cancer pain therapy.Cancer is a major world problem. Every year nearly
6 million new patients are diagnosed and more than 5
millions die. For patients suffering of cancer pain is a
common problem and an analysis of 32 published reviews
revealed that 70% of patients with advanced cancer had
pain as a major symptom. From available data it is not
possible to give a precise figure for the world-wide
prevalence of cancer pain because the total number of
cancer patients receiving treatment is not known. A conservative
estimate is that every day at least 3.5 million
people are suffering from cancer pain. This pain is
an important but neglected public health issue in developed
and developing countries. Effective pain management
particularly in patients with advanced disease is one of
four priorities in a comprehensive WHO cancer programme.
According to this programme morphine is the drug of
choice for patients with advanced disease having such
severe pains that they need a strong opioid. It has thus
been found that morphine is both efficacious and acceptable.Opioids such as morphine must be administered in an
acceptable form. The oral route is the best, because it
spares the patient the discomfort of injections; it also
maintains the patient's independence, since he or she
does not have to rely on someone else for the next dose.Morphine can be administered as a simple aqueous
solution of morphine sulphate (or hydrochloride) in a 
range of strengths (e.g. 1 mg of morphine sulphate per
ml to 20 mg per ml).The effective analgesic dose of morphine varies
considerably and ranges from as little as 5 mg to more
than 200 mg. In many patients, pain is satisfactorily
controlled with doses of between 5 and 30 mg every 4
hours. However, the dosage varies greatly for different
patients because of wide individual variations in the
oral bioavailability of the drug; the appropriate dose
is the one that works. The drug must be given by the
clock, i.e. at regular intervals, and not only when the
patient complains of pain. The use of morphine is dictated
by intensity of pain and not by brevity of prognosis.Sustained-release morphine tablets are available in
some countries in strengths varying from 10 to 200 mg.
The most widely available strength is 30 mg. The dominating
product is called a.o. MST Continus, MS Contin or
MST. In vitro

<CLAIMS>
Oral morphine preparation, characterized by essentially
complete bioavailability and an, for the major

part of the dissolution, essentially zero order and essentially
pH independent in vitro release of morphine

for a period of at least 8 hours, preferably at least 12
hours, during which period less than 100%, and more than

50, preferably more than 60% of the total amount of morphine
is dissolved, whereby the morphine is present in

the form of an easily soluble salt in combination with a
buffering agent, whereby the preparation is coated with

a diffusion membrane comprising a polymer which is essentially
insoluble in water and gastro-intestinal

fluids, in which polymer a water soluble pore-creating
agent is randomly dispersed, which preparation, in

steady state, provides effective plasma levels for a period
of at least 24 hours.
Preparation according to claim 1, characterized
by an in vitro release of morphine after 8 hours in the

range of 30-85, preferably 40-80.
Preparation according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in an in vitro release or morphine after 12 h in

the range of 50-100, preferably 60-100 and most preferably
80-100.
Preparation according to claim 1-3, characterized
in that it is formulated as a tablet, wherein the

morphine and the buffering agent are included in the
tablet core.
Preparation according to claim 1-4, characterized
in that the morphine salt is morphine sulphate or

morphine chloride or any other water soluble salt acceptable
for pharmaceutical use.
Preparation according to claim 1-5, characterized
in that the buffering agent is succinic acid, tartaric

acid, citric acid or any other organic acid acceptable
for pharmaceutical use. 
Preparation according to claim 1-3 and 5-6,
characterized in that it is formulated as a multiple

unit preparation.
Preparation according to any of the preceding
claims for administration with 24 hours intervals.
