<ABSTRACT>
A washing method and a washing apparatus capable of 
obtaining a washing or cleaning effect by mechanical energy 

obtained by cavitation phenomena or nonlinear oscillation of 
micro air bubbles generated during the resonance of a multi-phase 

medium using low frequency waves. The resonance 
phenomenon becomes accelerated and uniform by virtue of the 

injection of air bubbles in the tub or the provision of a 
sonic or ultrasonic oscillation unit, thereby enabling a 

superior washing performance to be obtained. Since the 
present invention eliminates use of any pulsator, it is 

possible to considerably reduce the phenomenon that clothes 
get twisted or tangled. As a result, few damage of clothes is 

generated. Moreover, the electric power consumption in 
washing or cleaning is greatly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a washing method and a 
washing apparatus utilizing low frequency oscillation wherein 
a washing is carried out by use of multi-phase medium 
consisting of water, detergent and air and being subjected to 
a resonance phenomenon at a specific frequency. Generally, a washing machine includes a pulsator 
rotatable mounted at the lower portion of a washing tub and a 
motor mounted on a base of the machine and adapted to rotate 
the pulsator. As the pulsator rotates by repeated normal and 
reverse rotations of the motor at a speed reduced by a speed 
reducing mechanism, a washing water in the washing tub 
produces a heart water flow or a rotated water flow. Clothes 
contained in the washing tub are moved by the water flow. 
During the movement of clothes, friction generates to carry 
out a washing. Such a washing machine is of the washing type 
utilizing the intensity or movement of water flows. In this 
type, an washing effect is obtained by a combination of a 
mechanical energy of the shear force of fluid, the bending 
movement and frictional action of clothes with a chemical 
effect of a detergent.  However, such a conventional washing machine has the 
following problems: First, clothes contained in the washing tub get easily 
twisted or tangled due to repeated agitating operations, 
namely, repeated normal and reverse rotations of the pulsator. 
As a result, a severe damage of clothes may occur. Second, the solubility of the detergent achieved by the 
water flow is low. As a result, the consumption of the 
detergent is excessive, thereby resulting in contamination of 
rivers. Third, clothes may be stained with the detergent not 
solved after the washing operation. The stained detergent may 
injure the user's skin. Finally, a larger quantity of washing water and a more 
lengthened washing time are required for removal of the 
detergent not solved. Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a 
washing method and a washing apparatus capable of obtaining a 
washing or cleaning effect by mechanical energy obtained by 
cavitation phenomena or nonlinear oscillation of micro air 
bubbles generated during the resonance of a multi-phase medium 
using low frequency waves.  Another object of the invention is to provide a washing 
method and a washing apparatus capable of achieving an 
efficient washing by utilizing a resonance and yet using a 
minimum energy required for the resonance. In accordance with one aspect, the present invention 
provides a washing method utilizing
