<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for shielding and/or 
cooling an electronic component mounted on a circuit board or 

the like. According to the invention, the device comprises a 
metal frame (2) which is mounted on the circuit board so as to 

surround the electronic component (1), and a metal cooling 
plate (3) which fits into the frame (2). The frame is provided 

along those edges thereof which lie distal to the circuit 
board with resilient contact means (5) which create electric 

contact between the plate (3) and the frame (2) and press the 
cooling plate (3) against the component (1) so as to achieve 

good thermal transmission between component and cooling 
plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for shielding and/or 
cooling an electronic component mounted on a printed circuit 
board or the like; see for example DE-C-3717009. It is often necessary to shield electronic components against 
ambient electromagnetic radiation, in order to prevent such 
components being affected by external interference, and in 
order to prevent, in turn, radiation emitted by such components 
having a disturbing influence on those parts of the 
equipment in which said components are fitted. Several 
different solutions have been proposed to this end. Many 
electronic components also generate heat when in use, and it 
is therefore necessary to cool such components to prevent them 
from being destroyed. Several different solutions have also 
been proposed to this end. The drawbacks with present-day 
devices is that they are intended either as a shielding medium 
or as a cooling medium, so that a device which is effective in 
shielding such components is not effective in cooling said 
components, whereas a device which is effective in cooling the 
components does not screen or shield the components satisfactorily. The object of the present invention is thus to provide a 
device which will both shield and cool an electronic component 
in a satisfactory fashion. This object has been achieved with 
a device as defined in claim 1 which combines component shielding and component 
cooling in a two-part construction which comprises a metal 
frame that surrounds the component and a metal cooling plate  
 
which fits into the frame and includes cooling fins, wherein 
a number of resilient contact means create metallic contact 
between the plate and the frame and, at the same time, press 
the cooling plate against the electronic component so as to 
obtain good thermal transmission between the component and the 
plate. The device has acquired the characteristic features set 
forth in the following Claims. The advantage afforded by a device constructed in accordance 
with the invention is that one single device provides the dual 
function of shielding and cooling an electronic component. The 
device also functions equally as well in solely one of these 
aspects, i.e. is effective in performing solely a shielding or 
solely a cooling function. The invention will now be described in more detail with 
reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof and also with 
reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a perspective view of one example of an electronic 
component and parts of the

cooling plate (1) is provided with cooling fins (8) on that 

side thereof which lies distal to the component (1). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
contact means (5) are comprised of tongues (6) which have been 

clipped downwardly to some extent in the edges of the frame 
(2) and which a
re folded inwards and extend slightly above the 
upper edge of said frame. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
outermost parts (7) of the tongues (6) are folded outwards to 

form cooling plate guides when inserting the cooling plate 
into the frame. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
frame (2) is provided with connecting legs (4) for fitting the
