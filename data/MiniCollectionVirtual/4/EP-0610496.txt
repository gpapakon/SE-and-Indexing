<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of joining a body (1) of crosslinked polyolefin to another body (3) formed of crosslinked polyolefin comprising the steps of heating the surfaces of the crosslinked polyolefin bodies (1, 3) to be joined, to a temperature in excess of the crystalline melting point of the said crosslinked polyolefin, and bringing together said heated surfaces of the bodies (1, 3) under pressure, and allowing the surfaces to cool and harden, wherein the aggregate gel content of the two bodies at the surfaces thereof is less than 70 %, preferably less than 68%, and most preferably no greater than 65 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of joining a first body of
crosslinked polyolefin material to a second body of polyolefin material according to the
preamble of claim 1.The present invention further relates to a polyolefin coupling sleeve for coupling
together pipes and/or pipe elements according to the preamble of claim 8.A method and a coupling sleeve of this kind is known from e.g. EP-A-0 333 379. There are many applications, for example the construction of pipelines
for carrying mains water or gas, which pipelines typically are buried beneath
the ground, where increased durability and strength are desirable properties,
and such properties can be imparted to the polyolefin by means of
crosslinking.Crosslinking is a process whereby individual polymer molecules are joined
together to form larger molecules, thus modifying the molecular weight
distribution of the polymer mass and the polymer properties. Crosslinking
may be brought about, for example, by the use of peroxide or silane
crosslinking agents, by electron beam crosslinking or by azo crosslinking.
Taken to its ultimate conclusion the crosslinking process would result in all
the molecules within the mass being linked to one another in a network,
forming one large molecule. In all practical embodiments this is not achieved
and crosslinked polyolefins consist of varying numbers of molecules large
and small, that may be joined together, as in a network structure, or may be
entangled within or without interpenetrating formations including crystalline
structures. Although at one extreme crosslinking may be said to occur when
simply one molecule has been joined to another, the effect of such a 
crosslinking would be insignificant within a substantial polymer mass.
Crosslinking is therefore relevant as a process when the bulk polymer
properties have been modified in a significant way. Conventionally this
would be when properties are developed that are associated with the
behaviour of true thermosetting plastics i.e. loss of thermoplasticity and
enhanced resistance to deformation at elevated temperatures. However, low
levels of crosslinking may significantly modify certain characteristics without
complete loss of thermoplastic properties. Crosslinking sufficient to
significantly modify the molecular weight distribution so that a change in
Melt Flow Index (MFI) may be measured, may result in changes in certain
physical properties such as resistance to environmental stress cracking,
fracture toughness, and creep properties. As the crosslinking
