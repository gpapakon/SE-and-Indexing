<ABSTRACT>
A composition of a polymer of an 8 to 40 carbon 
hydrocarbyl ester of an ethylenically unsaturated acid, 

short chain ester-containing monomers, and short chain 
alkyl ether monomers; and a mixture of hydrocarbyl-substituted 

polynuclear aromatic compounds, is effective 
to reduce the cloud point of paraffinic liquids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition useful 
for reducing the cloud point of paraffinic liquids. When diesel fuels, home heating oils, and other 
paraffinic liquids are cooled, solidification occurs 
progressively, normally over a range spanning some 10 to 
15°C. This solidification is generally undesirable for 
materials which are normally handled in the liquid state, 
and efforts to measure and ameliorate this phenomenon have 
been pursued. Cloud point is the measurement of the 
temperature at which paraffin crystals first appear when 
such a material is cooled. This value is determined by 
standardized methods such as ASTM D 2500. The cloud point 
of a particular material depends on the paraffin (particularly 
n-paraffin) concentration in the liquid, on the 
molecular weight of the particular paraffins, and on the 
chemical nature of the non-paraffin component of the 
liquid. For instance, the presence of higher molecular 
weight paraffinic molecules generally leads to higher cloud 
points. At temperatures below the cloud point, the material 
becomes increasingly solid, until the pour point (ASTM 
D 97) is reached, that is, the temperature at which the 
material has essentially solidified. Although there are 
many materials which are known to be suitable as pour point 
depressants, a reduction of cloud point is considerably 
more difficult to achieve. The present invention provides 
for the reduction of the cloud point of paraffinic liquids, 
thus permitting the wider use of paraffinic liquids as fuel 
and lubricants, particularly at low temperatures. A fuller discussion of the phenomenon of cloud point, 
including the measurement thereof by differential scanning 
calorimetry, is found SAE Technical Paper Series No. 
861527, "New Additives for Diesel Fuels: Cloud-Point 
Depressants," Faure et al., October 6-9, 1986. This paper 
also discloses the use of copolymers of linear α-olefins 
with acrylic, vinylic and maleic unsaturated compounds as 
additives to reduce cloud point.  U.S. Patent 2,491,683, Munday et al., December 20, 
1949, discloses a lubricant composition consisting of a 
major proportion of waxy mineral lubricating oil having 
dissolved therein about 0.07 to 0.20 % of a wax-naphthalene 
pour depressor (the condensation product of 100 parts 
chlorinated paraffin wax with naphthalene) and 0.05 to 
0.25% of a polymerization product (e.g. a copolymer) of 
fumaric acid esters of mixed alcohols obtained by hydrogenation 
of coconut oil. Small amounts of the additive 
mixture give
