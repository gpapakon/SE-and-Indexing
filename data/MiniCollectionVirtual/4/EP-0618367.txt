<ABSTRACT>
A disk-shaped impeller (42) having on its 
periphery a multiple radial vanes (56) and a multiple 

radial impeller grooves (58) is rotatably disposed in a 
pump housing. On each end surfaces (42a, 42b) of the 

impeller (42) there are formed a plurality of C-shaped 
grooves (66). As the impeller (42) is rotated at a 

higher speed, the fluid in the C-shaped grooves (66) in 
the impeller (42) acquires a velocity component in an 

impeller's axial direction to generate a force sufficient 
to push a pump cover and a pump casing in the axial 

direction. Accordingly, since it is avoided for the 
impeller (42) to adhere either the pump cover or the pump 

casing, the space between the impeller and the housing 
inner wall is reduced while the possible leakage of the 

fluid is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impeller of a Westco-type 
pump, which is suitable, for example, as an automobile 
fuel pump. The "Westco-type pump" referred herein is 
also called a vortex pump, a regenerative pump or a 
periphery pump. The Westco-type pump makes use of an impeller 
which is a disk formed on its entire periphery with a 
multitude of recesses. A pumping action is effected in a 
working passage surrounding a portion of the periphery of 
the impeller. One end of the working passage is communicated 
via an intake passage with a suction tube and the 
other end is communicated via a discharge passage with a 
discharge tube. There is a partition between the 
discharge passage and the intake passage. There is 
formed an extremely small radial space between an outer 
periphery of the impeller and an inner periphery of the 
partition, and an extremely small axial space (a side 
clearance) between a radial inward end surface portion of 
the impeller and a radial inward inner surface portion of 
a casing. According to the conventional Westco-type pump, 
when the side clearance between the impeller and the  
 
casing is reduced, the pumping efficiency is increased 
because the leakage of the fluid is reduced. On the 
other hand, however, there is a possibility that a 
linking phenomenon in which the impeller and the casing 
adhere to each other is readily occurred. When the 
linking phenomenon takes place, the sliding resistance is 
extremely increased and then the pumping efficiency is 
deteriorated. For this reason, there has hitherto been a 
limitation to reduce the side clearances between the 
impeller and the casing. In order to resolve this problem, several 
efforts have been made heretofore. For example, Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58-19745 discloses a 
recess provided in an inner surface of the casing for 
generating an axial force urging the impeller, thereby 
improving the pumping efficiency. Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication No. 58-2495 discloses a spiral groove 
formed on an end surface of the impeller so as to reduce 
the thrust load acting on the impeller. Japanese 
Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 57-114195 
discloses a number of spiral grooves formed on an end 
surface of the impeller and an inner surface of the 
casing. Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No. 60-85284 discloses a wedge-shaped layer formed 
between an inner wall of the housing and a sliding 
surface of the impeller, thereby reducing the wear of the 
impeller. However,

An impeller of Westco-type pump for pressurizing a 
fluid, said impeller comprising: 


a pluralitiy of impeller vanes (56) which in use 
face an annular pumping chamber (49) defined by a casing; and 
end surfaces (42a, 42b) which in use are separated 
from seal surfaces of said casing by small axial spaces, 
groove means (66; 72; 84a, 84b) provided in 
portions of said end surfaces of said impeller which in use 

face said seal surfaces of said casing, wherein said groove 
means are constructed and arranged to concentrate fluid 

between said end surfaces of said impeller and said seal 
surfaces of said casing at edge portions of said groove means 

so that fluid flows towards said seal surfaces, said groove 
means being formed such that in use said fluid forms a 

substantially uniform fluid pressure distribution; each of 
said groove means having two portions, each having a firs
t 
end and a second end, said second end being circumferentially 

displaced from said first end in the direction of rotation of 
said impeller, one portion of each of said groove means 

having its first end displaced radially further from a center 
of said impeller than said second end, and the other of said 

two portions having said second end displaced radially 
further from said center of said impeller than said first 

end, whereby the two portions of each groove means are either 
joined at the first ends to form a single groove, or are 

formed separately from each other, there being no 
communication through the impeller between groove means on 

opposite end surfaces. 
An impeller according to claim 1, wherein said grooves are 
completely encompassed by said end surfaces (42a, 42b) facing 

said seal surfaces.
