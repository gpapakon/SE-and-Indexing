<ABSTRACT>
The pack proposed has a bottom element (1) which accommodates the pill-holder and which has integral dispenser openings (10) sized and spaced to match the size and spacing of the pills in the holder. The pack also has a rotatable top element (2) designed to be fitted over the bottom element (1) and having a pill ejector (11). In order to ensure that a pack of this kind is simple and safe to handle and reliable in operation, and prevents the drugs it contains from being damaged, either the bottom or the top element has moulded undulating arrestor marks (4) which extend in a circle round the pack and in which a flexible tongue (3) attached to the other element opposite the undulating arrestor marks engages.
