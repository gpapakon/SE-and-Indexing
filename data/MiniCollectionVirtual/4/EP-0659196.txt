<ABSTRACT>
A graft copolymer A is constituted by (A1) 1 to 90 % by weight, with respect to A, of a particulate graft copolymer A1 having a glass transition temperature below 0  C and an average particle size below 40 nm; and (A2) 10 to 99 % by weight, with respect to A, of a graft coating A2 made of olefinically unsaturated monomers that form soft or hard polymers. The average particle size of the graft copolymer A as a whole is lower than 50 nm. Also disclosed is a moulding material containing this graft copolymer.
