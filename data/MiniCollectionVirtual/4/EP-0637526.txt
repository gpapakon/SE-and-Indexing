<ABSTRACT>
A lighting device and a mirror (14) borne by a lid (34) are arranged in a housing (1). There is provision for the lid (34) to extend parallel to the floor of the housing (1) when the mirror (14) is in the out-of-use position, to have a U-shaped recess which starts from a longitudinal edge and reduces the surface of the cover, for the purpose of permitting the lens (8) of the lighting device which is constructed in the shape of a quarter circle and corresponds to the dimensions of the recess to pass through and is coupled to the housing (1) by its edge region which has the recess. There is also provision for a mounting opening (31) for the individual elements of the lighting device to be provided in the base of the housing (1) and for the housing (1) to be equipped with an electric circuit and a switch (6) which has three switch positions in order to switch off the lighting in a first position, to switch the lighting on or off by means of a vehicle door contact in a second position and to switch the lighting on or off by means of a folding movement of the cover (34), bearing the mirror (14), in a third position.

A mirror with an illumination device, 
particularly for vehicles, comprising a trough-like 

approximately rectangular housing (1), in which are 
provided on the one hand the illumination device 

comprising at least an electric light source and a 
diffusion plate (8) for covering the light source and 

on the other hand the mirror (14) which is supported 
by a cover (34) which can be tilted out from the 

housing (1) and wherein the cover (34) extends in the 
position of non-use of the mirror (14) in a 

direction parallel to the base of the housing (1), 
characterized in that an U-shaped recess which 

reduces the surface of the cover and which departs 
from a longitudinal edge, which recess is provided 

for the passage of the quarter-circular diffusion 
plate (8) of the illumination device, whose 

dimensions correspond to those of the aperture and 
which is linked with its recessed border on the 

housing (1), in that in the base of the housing (1) 
there is provided an assembly opening (31) for the 

individual components of the illumination device and 
in that the housing (1) is provided with an 

electrical circuit and a switch (6) with three 
switching positions, in order to switch off the  

 
illumination device in a first position, to switch on 

or off the illumination device by means of a door-contact 
in a second position, and to switch on or off 

the illumination device by means of a tilting 
movement of the cover (34) which supports the mirror 

(14) in a third position. 
A mirror according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the cover (34) comprises a lower part (12) and 

an upper part (15) which corresponds to the lower 
part and is provided with a window opening for the 

mirror (14) and on the opposed walls of the U-shaped 
recess bearing openings (22) in order to accommodate 

support pins (13, 23) which form the tilting axle and 
which are provided on the housing (1). 
A mirror according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that one of the support pins (13) for the cover 

(34) comprises an eccentric pin holder (27), which is 
in contact with an elastic tab (26). 
A mirror according to at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 

housing (1) supports a spring loaded locking device 
(4) for the cover (34) on the side opposed to the 

link of the cover (34). 
A mirror according to at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the  

 
housing (1) comprises on the free border a circular 

flange (35), which is parallel to the base and on a 
longitudinal wall is provided with outward protruding 

assembly hooks and on the facing longitudinal wall 
outward protruding assembly springs (3). 
A mirror according to at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 

flange (35) is provided with a insertion slit (33) 
for the switch (6). 
A mirror according to at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 6, characterized in that near 

the assembly opening (31) of the housing (1) there 
are provided holding limbs (21) for elements of the 

illumination device and support limbs for linking the 
cover (34) on the housing (1). 
A mirror according to at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 

housing (1) and the cover (34) are injection molded 
plastic parts. 
A mirror according to at least one of the 
preceding claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the 

same can be positioned in a recess provided in the 
roof or in a sun visor of a vehicle.
