<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a combustion chamber for a turbojet comprising a structural wall (2, 3) covered on one of its faces by at least one ring (12) of tiles (13) juxtaposed circumferentially, said ring (12) being fastened by its upstream and downstream edges in two opposite grooves (10a, 10b) each delimited by an annular wing (11a, 11b) at a spacing from the structural wall (2, 3), characterised in that at least one of said wings (11b) comprises a circumferential cutout (15) adapted to allow the mounting of said ring (12) of tiles (13) by successive introduction of the tiles (13) of said ring (12) via said cutout (15) and engagement by rotation in said two grooves (10a, 10b) and in that two adjacent tiles of said ring are positioned overlapping facing said cutout (15) so as to prevent a tile (13) coming out via said cutout (15).

A combustion chamber for a turbojet engine comprising 
a structural wall (2, 3) covered on one of its faces by at 

least one ring (12) of circumferentially juxtaposed panels 
(13), the ring (12) being engaged by its upstream and 

downstream edges in two opposite grooves (10a, 10b) each 
bounded by an annular wing (11a, 11b) spaced apart from the 

structural wall (2, 3),
 
   characterised in that at least one (11b) of the wings is 

formed with a peripheral rebate (15) adapted for the assembly 
of the ring (12) of panels (13) by the consecutive 

introduction of the panels through the rebate (15) and 
engagement by rotation in the two grooves (10a, 10b), and in 

that two adjacent panels of the ring are positioned to 
straddle the rebate (15) in order to prevent the egress of a 

panel (13) through the rebate (15). 
A combustion chamber according to claim 1 wherein 
the structural wall comprises an outer shell (2) and an inner 

shell (3) interconnected upstream by a chamber end piece (4), 
characterised in that the outer shell (3) and the inner shell 

(2) are integral. 
A combustion chamber according to claim 2 comprising 
a primary zone (7) and a dilution zone (8) and inlet air 

orifices in the primary zone (7) and dilution zone (8), 
characterised in that the orifices are in the form of tubes 

(16) having support collars (17) and disposed in registering 
bores (18) in the ring (12) of panels (13) and the structural 

wall (2, 3).  
 
A combustion chamber according to any of claims 1 to 
3, characteried in that the ring (12) of panels (13) is 

disposed on that face of the structural wall which is outside 
the combustion chamber. 
A combustion chamber according to any of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the ring (12) of panels (13) is 

disposed on that face of the structural wall (2, 3) which is 
inside the combustion chamber. 
A combustion chamber according to any of claims 1 to 
5, chartacterised in that the panels (13) are formed upstream 

and downstream with grooves (19a, 19b) adapted to co-operate 
with the wings (11a, 11b). 
A combustion chamber according to any of claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the panels (13) comprise three 

elements disposed one above another, namely a metal 
multiperforate outer wall (20), a metal multiperforate inner 

wall (23) and a porous intermediate wall (22) between the 
outer wall (20) and the inner wall (23). 
A combustion chamber according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the porous intermediate wall is made of 

stainless steel.
