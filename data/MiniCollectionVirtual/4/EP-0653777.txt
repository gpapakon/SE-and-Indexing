<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high-pressure discharge lamp provided with a 
discharge vessel (3) which is enclosed with intervening space (9) by an outer bulb (8). 

The lamp is provided with a starter circuit constructed as a starter unit comprising a 
bimetal switch (1) and a glowswitch starter (2). 
The bimetal switch has a bimetal (15) which is fastened with a fastening 
point (152) to a conductor (70), and rests in the cold state against a break contact point 

(151) of a break contact. According to the invention, the fastening point and the break 
contact point form part of an insulating rigid body (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a lamp starter unit formed
by a glow switch starter with a longitudinal axis and a housing and by a bimetal switch.The invention also relates to a high-pressure discharge lamp provided with
such a starter unit.A lamp starter unit and a lamp of the kind mentioned in the opening
paragraph is known from EP-A-0 345 873 = USP 4,981,330.In the known lamp, the bimetal element switch of the starter unit is
fastened at the one hand to an electrical supply conductor extending to a lamp electrode.At the other hand a contact point of a break contact is formed by a
conductor which is wound around the discharge vessel so as to form a wire winding,
which conductor is connected to a further electrical supply conductor via the glowswitch
starter.Although the construction as a wire winding around the discharge vessel
provides a good definition of the contact point of the break contact, it is found in
practice that fastening of the bimetal element to the supply conductor often leads to
problems. Thus a small tangential displacement of the fastening point of the bimetal
element on the supply conductor will already have a major influence on the position of
the bimetal element relative to the contact point of the break contact. This may easily
give rise to an incorrect functioning, or a failure to function altogether, of the bimetal
switch. An incorrect adjustment of the bimetal element thus created can only be
corrected in a separate aftertreatment during the lamp production process by means of a
readjustment of the mechanical pretensioning of the bimetal element. The said
displacement leads to production rejects in those cases in which no repair is found to be
possible.The invention has for its object to provide a means by which the above
disadvantages can be counteracted.The lamp starter unit according to the invention is defined in claim 1. A high-pressure discharge lamp provided with such a starter unit is defined in claim 4. Embodiments are set out in dependent claims 2, 3 and 5. Since both switches form a unit and since both fastening point and contact
point form part of one and the same rigid body, their mutual placements are well
defined. This renders possible a robust construction of the starter unit. A further
advantage is that the bimetal switch is composed of only two parts, in contrast to the
state of the art. Furthermore it is an advantage that the starter circuit forms an
independent unit which may be fully prefabricated separately from lamp manufacture
and may be subsequently

characterized in that the
bimetal switch comprises an insulating rigid support (100) being provided with an

electrical connection conductor at either end (16,17) and thus forming a rigid body,
which rigid body has a long axis (B), and in that both an electrically conducting

fastening point (152) for fastening a bimetal element (15) and an electrically conducting
break contact point for forming a break contact (151) together with the bimetal element

(15) form part of the rigid body.

unit is provided with connection conductors (22,17A) which are situated diametrically

opposite one another in relation to the longitudinal axis (A) of the glowswitch starter,
tangent to the housing (20), and parallel to one another in a plane perpendicular to the

longitudinal axis of the glowswitch starter.
A high-pressure discharge lamp provided with a starter unit according to
any of the claims 1, 2 and 3, characterized in that the lamp is provided with a discharge

vessel (3) connected to current supply conductors (4,5) which vessel is enclosed with
