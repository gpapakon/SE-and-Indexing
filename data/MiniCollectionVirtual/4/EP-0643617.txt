<ABSTRACT>
A unit for treating liquid comprises a cylindrical container (1) which, in an upper chamber (6), has a set of slender tubes (8) which the liquid is forced to pass on its way from an inlet (10) to an outlet (9), so as to be subjected to a treatment, such as deionisation, during this forced passage. An annular casing (11) is arranged in a lower chamber (7) and serves to distribute the liquid flowing in through the inlet (10). The casing (11) is defined by inner and outer sidewalls (12, 13) sealingly interconnected along an upper edge portion (14) as well as interconnected by at least one lower, transverse wall (15) which is provided with a plurality of small holes through which the liquid is squeezed out in the form of a large number of individual jets. The cross-sectional area of the liquid-distributing casing (11) continuously decreases away from the inlet (10) towards an opposite end (18) of the casing. A centrally located means (9) is arranged in the free chamber (7) of the container for deflecting and guiding the liquid flowing inwards from the annular casing (11), in a controlled and even, upwardly-directed flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a unit for treating
liquid, comprising a suitably cylindrical container which,
in a first, suitably upper chamber, has a set of comparatively
slender tubes or ducts which the liquid is forced
to pass on its way from an inlet in the container to an
outlet, so as to be subjected to a treatment, such as
deionisation, during this forced passage.Units of this type are used in the nuclear industry
for cleaning the water to be taken into the reactor, more
precisely by deionisation, primarily in respect of Fe ions
but also by removal of undesirable pollutants. To this
end, the slender treatment tubes are provided with perforations
and surrounded by a cloth whose outside is coated
with an ion-exchange medium. In actual practice, the
treatment tubes are so mounted in an upper chamber as to
be separate from an open, lower chamber, the treatment
tubes being closed at the bottom and open at the top.
Thus, water entering the tubes from outside will first
penetrate the external layer of ion-exchange medium and
then pass through the small perforations in the circumferential
walls of the tubes, before discharging into the
upper part of the container, where it is collected in a
throughgoing outlet tube extending centrally through the
lower, free chamber and out through the bottom of the
container.In prior-art units of this type, the inlet consists
of a tube which opens directly into the lower chamber of
the container, more precisely in the cylindrical wall,
with the tube projecting radially therefrom. One problem
which is difficult to master in these known units is
that the flow velocity of the water becomes extremely
uneven outside the separate treatment tubes owing to
uncontrolled turbulence in the lower chamber. Thus, the 
velocity of the water flowing past the treatment tubes
can be extremely high at some tubes while being comparatively
low at others. Where the water passes at a high
speed, the ion-exchange medium on the tubes is quickly
eroded, which shortens the time of operation elapsing
between the required restorations of the medium. These
restorations being troublesome and time-consuming operations,
the too short times of operation therebetween
will detract from cost-effectiveness.This invention aims at remedying the above-mentioned
shortcomings of prior-art units of this type and providing
a unit which is capable of long-term operation without
there being any need of restoring or replacing the ion-exchange
medium. Thus, a basic object of the invention is
to provide a unit in which the

<CLAIMS>
A unit for treating liquid, comprising a suitably
cylindrical container (1) which, in a first, suitably

upper chamber (6), has a set of comparatively slender
tubes or ducts (8) which the liquid is forced to pass on

its way from an inlet (10) in the container to an outlet

during this forced passage, 
character ised

in that an annular casing or shell (11) is
arranged in a second, suitably lower chamber (7) opposite

to the first chamber (6) in the container and serves to
distribute the liquid supplied through the inlet (10),

said casing (11) being defined by inner and outer side
walls (12, 13) sealingly interconnected along an edge

portion (14) as well as interconnected by at least one
transverse wall (15) which is opposite to said edge portion

and which has formed therein a plurality of small
holes or openings (16), through which the liquid can be

forced out in the form of a large number of separate jets,
the cross-sectional area of the liquid-distributing casing

(11) continuously decreasing from the inlet (10) towards
an opposite end (18) of the casing, and that a means (9)

is arranged substantially centrally in the second chamber
(7) for deflecting and guiding the liquid flowing inwards

from the liquid-distributing casing (11), in a controlled
and even flow directed towards said set of tubes (8) for

treating the liquid.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised

in that the cross-sectional or flow area of the
liquid-distributing casing decreases in a substantially

linear fashion.
