<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward a
method and apparatus for rapidly processing data
sequences and, more particularly, toward a method
and apparatus for pipelined and parallel processing
of data sequences representing images.Many systems have been developed for
processing data sequences representing images.
Several such systems, referred to herein as image
enhancement systems, have been provided for
obtaining data representing images, i.e., image
data, wherein the image may represent physical
features of a biological specimen. As examples,
image enhancement systems have been developed for
obtaining images of internal organs of a patient in
a non-intrusive manner, for example, nuclear
magnetic resonance devices, ultrasound imaging, CAT
scan imaging, etc. These devices are typically used
for capturing and processing data to provide an
image of a functional system of a patient, as for
example, the patient's heart, lungs, etc. The
processing of the image data performed by these
devices is primarily to insure the accuracy and
clarity of the resulting image.Other systems, referred to herein as image
analysis systems, have been provided for obtaining
image data of specimens taken from a patient. As
examples, devices have been provided for obtaining
image data representing blood cells, bone marrow
cells, brain cells, etc. These systems are
typically designed to capture and process image data 
to determine characteristics of the specimen, as for
example, blood cell count. The processing of image
data performed by these systems are primarily to
analyze the image data for determining whether the
specimen exhibits the characteristic.In any of the foregoing imaging systems, a
large amount of data is typically required to
accurately represent the image. Also, in order to
obtain meaningful information from the captured
image data, a large number of data processing steps
must be performed. This is true whether the
processing is performed to enhance the image data,
as is done in image enhancement systems, or whether
the processing is performed to analyze the image
data, as is done in image analysis systems.Due to the large number of data processing
operations required, designers of these systems have
attempted to provide circuits for processing the
image data in a pipe lined and parallel fashion,
i.e., continuously and simultaneously, so that data
throughput can be increased and thereby the time
required to perform the image enhancement or image
analysis can be reduced. However, the effectiveness
of prior pipe
