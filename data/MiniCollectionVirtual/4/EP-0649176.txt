<ABSTRACT>
An insulated-gate bipolar transistor is provided which is 
capable of detecting an overcurrent in a short time accurately while 

maintaining the ratio of the main current to the detection current 
constant under various operating circumstances and which, when 

combined with an externally connected overcurrent protection circuit, 
can reliably protect the device against overcurrent. An 

insulated-gate bipolar transistor has a semiconductor substrate (5) 
on which a plurality of IGBT cells (6) are packed, preferably in 

striped form. Current-detecting cells (6b) are disposed on parts of 
the substrate adjacent to the main cells (6a). The current-detecting 

cell (6b) are equipped with an emitter electrode (7b) which is 
isolated from the emitter electrodes (7a) of the main cells and 

connected with an external overcurrent protection circuit. When an 
accident such as load short circuit takes place, the overcurrent is 

quickly and accurately detected by the current-detecting cells (6b). 
The externally connected protection circuit (3, 4) controls the 

gates. Thus, the main current is limited to a low current which is 
less than the short circuit withstand capability of the IGBT. In 

this way, overcurrent protection is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulated-gate bipolar 
transistor (IGBT) acting as a power device applicable to an inverter 
device or the like. An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (hereinafter referred 
to as an "IGBT") is a voltage-driven semiconductor switching device 
which can be turned on and off at a high speed and which has a 
relatively low ON voltage. Insulated-gate bipolar transistors have 
enjoyed wide acceptance in power electronics applications. In IGBT-output type inverter devices and similar devices, 
when an electric motor is started, or if an accident such as a load 
short circuit or an arm short circuit takes place, an overcurrent 
flows through the IGBT. Thus, quite severe requirements for 
withstanding high voltages and large currents are imposed on the 
IGBT. An important requirement is an ability to withstand a 
short-circuit. Inverter apparatus generally includes a protection circuit 
which detects a short-circuit and cuts off the power supply, but 
there is usually an interval of from 10 to 20 µsec between detection 
of the short-circuit and shutdown. The IGBT is however required not 
to be destroyed in this interval. Accordingly, an overcurrent protection system is generally 
adopted to prevent the IGBT device from being destroyed when a short 
circuit takes place until the power supply is cut off by a protector 
device for an inverter. Such an overcurrent protection system, which 
is separate from the aforementioned protector device, quickly detects 
an overcurrent flowing through the IGBT, and a signal based on the 
overcurrent detection is applied to the gate which controls the 
current flowing through the IGBT, reducing the current to below the 
withstand capability of the IGBT before the power supply is cut off, 
whereby the current is suppressed to within the short-circuit 
tolerance of the device.  Figure 7 shows a conventional overcurrent protection circuit 
for to an IGBT. In the Figure, indicated by 1 is a main IGBT. A 
separate auxiliary current-detection element (IGBT) 2 is connected in 
parallel with the main IGBT 1 and used to detect an electrical 
current. A current-detecting resistor 3 is connected in series with 
the current-detecting IGBT 2. A switching element 4 (MOSFET) is 
connected with a gate-driving circuit for both the IGBTs 1 and 2, and 
is turned on and off according to a voltage developed across the 
current-detecting resistor 3. In this arrangement, when an accident such as a load short 
circuit takes place, an overcurrent flows through the
