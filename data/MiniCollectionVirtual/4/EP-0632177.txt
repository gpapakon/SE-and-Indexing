<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a lock housing with added-on (inserted) safety cylinder. This lock housing makes it possible for the safety cylinder (3) to be interchangeable on the housing which for this purpose includes means (20) for inserting a safety cylinder of one type or another into the housing (2), as well as means (35, 27) for extracting the lock bolt (6) from outside the housing (2) to allow it to be replaced with some other lock bolt designed for a safety cylinder of some other type. This lock housing makes it possible, for example, to replace a European type safety cylinder with a lantern safety cylinder.
