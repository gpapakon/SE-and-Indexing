<ABSTRACT>
In a television receiver with multi-standard sound, circuit means are provided which automatically detect the sound standard received in each case from the received signal. From this, a manipulated variable is derived which automatically initiates the switch-over operations necessary with the individual standards. In this connection, it is known to convert the received sound carrier, using a variable-frequency mixing carrier, to a sound carrier having a frequency which is identical with all standards and which is then supplied to an FM demodulator via a filter. It is the object to create a detection circuit which responds reliably and unambiguously and which, in particular, can be integrated well. To detect the standard, the frequency (fLO) of the mixing carrier (LO) is changed in steps. The output of the filter (40) is connected to an amplitude detector (42), the output of which is connected via an A/D converter (31) to a processor which generates a manipulated variable identifying the respective standard from the correlation between the occurrence of a carrier at the output of the filter (40) and the frequency (fLO) of the mixing carrier (LO). Especially for a multi-standard television receiver for optionally receiving sound carriers according to the M, BG stereo, I, DK standards.

Method for identifying the audio Standard in a
television receiver, in which an audio IF carrier (f
i
)
and a variable-frequency (f
LO
) local-oscillator carrier
(LO) are mixed (38) and the mixed signal (f
i2
) is fed
via a filter (40) with a constant pass frequency to an

audio demodulator (44), characterized in that, in order
to identify the audio Standard, the frequency (f
LO
) of
the local-oscillator carrier is automatically varied in

steps, and the output signal of the filter (40) is fed
to an amplitude detector (42), and the A/D-converted

(31) output signal of the amplitude detector is
evaluated in a processor which uses the association

between the occurrence of a carrier of the output of
the filter (40) and the respective frequency (f
LO
) of
the local-oscillator carrier (LO) to produce a control

variable which characterizes the respective audio
Standard.
Method according to Claim 1, in which, in order
to identify the audio Standard, the frequency (f
LO
) of
the local-oscillator carrier (LO) is varied in steps

which are equal to the smallest frequency difference
between audio carriers, and adjacent frequencies, of

the various Standards.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the
local-oscillator carrier (LO) is formed by means of a

switchable PLL stage (39).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which the mixed signal (f
i2
) is passed via a further
filter (41) having a constant, different pass frequency 

to a further audio demodulator (45) and to a further
amplitude detector (43), whose output signal is

likewise A/D-converted (31) and is evaluated in the
processor.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in
which the audio IF carrier (f
i
) is an intercarrier
audio carrier obtained in an upstream mixing stage

(36).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in
which the control variable which characterizes the

respective audio Standard is used to change the mode of
operation of the telephone receiver depending on the

audio Standard determined.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in
which the normal operating frequency (f
i2
) of the mixed
signal is 500 kHz for all audio Standards.
Circuit for identifying the audio Standard in a
television receiver, in which an audio IF carrier (f
i
)
and a local-oscillator carrier (LO) at a variable

frequency (f
LO
) are fed to a mixing stage (38) whose
output signal (f
i2
) is fed via a filter (40) having a
constant pass frequency to an audio demodulator (44),

characterized in that in order to identify the audio
Standard, the frequency (f
LO
) of the local-oscillator
carrier is automatically varied in steps, and the

output signal of the filter (40) is fed to an amplitude
detector (42), and the A/D-converted (31) output signal

of the amplitude detector is evaluated in a processor
which uses the association between the occurrence of a

carrier of the output of the filter (40) and the
respective frequency (f
LO
) of the local-oscillator
carrier (LO) to produce a control variable which

characterizes the respective audio Standard.
