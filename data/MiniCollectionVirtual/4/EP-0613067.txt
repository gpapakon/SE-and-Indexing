<ABSTRACT>
An image carrier of an organic photosensitive 
material containing a charge-generating agent and a 

charge-transporting agent, and a transfer roller using an 
electrically conducting polyurethane rubber composition 

which is so cured as to exhibit a rubber hardness of 
higher than 50째 (JIS A), are disposed being spaced apart 

maintaining a small gap which is greater than the 
thickness of the transfer material enabling the toner to 

be transferred onto the transfer material. This makes it 
possible to prevent the occurrence of image defects such 

as white spots and the like, to form transferred image 
favorably and stably over an extended period of time 

maintaining a high density without fogging and consuming a 
small transfer current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transfer device
for use in an electrostatic photo-processing
(image-forming system) such as in an electrostatic copying
machine, a printer, a facsimile and the like. More
specifically, the invention relates to a transfer device
which prevents the organic photosensitive material from
being harmed by the use of a transfer roller.In an image-forming apparatus based upon the
electrostatic photo-processing, the toner image formed on
an image carrier is transferred by passing a transfer
material such as a paper between the image carrier and a
transfer roller that is disposed being opposed thereto.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 177063/1989
discloses a transfer roller having a hardness of 30째 (JIS
A) or smaller that is employed for such a transfer device.
That is, this transfer device uses a transfer roller of a
low hardness to prevent the coagulation of the toner that
exists on the surface of the image carrier and to
facilitate the cleaning with ease.Moreover, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
200277/1989 discloses a transfer system using the same
transfer roller as the one described above or a like
transfer roller wherein an electric charge of a polarity
opposite to that of the toner is fed to a transfer
material in a state where there exists a gap with respect
to the image carrier (photosensitive material) and, then,
the transfer material is brought into contact with the
image carrier.It was found, however, that the organic
photosensitive material deteriorates when the transfer 
system using the above-mentioned transfer roller is
adapted to the organic photosensitive material that
contains a charge-generating agent and a
charge-transporting agent.That is, the transfer roller made of an electrically
conducting polyurethane rubber composition exhibits
excellent abrasion resistance, electric properties and
ozone resistant properties. When this transfer roller is
used for transferring the toner from the organic
photosensitive material onto the transfer material,
however, image defects such as white spots and the like
occur due to deterioration of the organic photosensitive
material.The object of the present invention therefore is to
provide a transfer device which is capable of forming a
favorably and stably transferred image over an extended
period of time preventing the occurrence of the
above-mentioned image defects.According to the present invention, there is provided
a transfer device in an image-forming apparatus which has
an image carrier and a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A transfer device in an image-forming apparatus
which has an image carrier and a transfer roller and

permits a transfer material to pass therethrough so that
the toner on the image carrier is transferred onto the

transfer material, wherein said image carrier is an
organic photosensitive material containing a

charge-generating agent and a charge-transporting agent,
said transfer roller is made of an electrically conducting

polyurethane rubber composition which is so cured as to
exhibit a rubber hardness of higher than 50째 (JIS A), and

said image carrier and said transfer roller are disposed

spaced apart maintaining a small gap which is
greater than the thickness of the transfer material the transfer roller being supplied with a transfer voltage

enabling the toner to be transferred onto the transfer
material.
A transfer device according to claim 1, wherein
said small gap is from 0.2 to 2 mm.
A transfer device according to claim 1, wherein
said transfer roller is made of a polyurethane rubber

composition which is so cured as to exhibit a rubber
hardness of 70째 (JIS A) or higher.
