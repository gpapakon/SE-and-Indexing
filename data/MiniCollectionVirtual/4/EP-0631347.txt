<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly is shown having 
connectors (4) and (6). The connector (2) has a sliding 

latch (108) which can be moved transversely to cooperate 
with lugs (150) on a housing body (6). The lugs (150) 

have camming surfaces (150a, 150b) which cooperate with 
entry surfaces (134a,134b; 136a, 136b) which cams the 

slide (108) to a preliminary position, where a shoulder 
(150d) on the locking lug (150) can rest on shoulders 

(134d, 136d) within the locking slide (108).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to an electrical
connector according to the pre-characterizing part of claims 1 and 6.In many applications the amount of space available
where electrical connectors are mated is quite limited.
For example, in automotive applications, the mating of
connectors may have to occur in the confined space within
a door or door pillar. The limited space makes it
difficult to positively seat connectors, especially those
with a plurality of interconnections therein, as the
limited space may prevent the installer from using both
hands effectively. Therefore, it is desirable to have a
latching structure that has a mechanical advantage
feature, allowing the application of a small force to the
latch structure itself, with the application of a large
force between the mating connectors to accommodate a full
engagement.A connector having the features of the preamble of claims 1 and 6
is known from German Patent 36 45
179, where a sliding latch is moveable transversely of the
mating direction. The latch includes latching grooves
which are angled relative to a length of the sliding
latch. The grooves receive latching lugs located on the
mating connector which, when the lugs of the other
connector housing are positioned within the grooves and
the sliding latch is moved relative to the one connector
housing, the two connectors are brought into mating
engagement. While this connector system has found wide
acceptance in the connector industry, in particular in the
automotive application, the connector still requires the
installer to use two hands to make the connection, as the
connector containing the lugs must be mated with the
connector containing the sliding latch, in a polarized
manner within the grooves of the sliding latch, while the 
other hand activates the sliding latch, to cam the two
connectors together.It is an object of the invention then, to provide an
electrical connector and a sliding latch for such connector where the
connector parts could be mated by using only one hand.In accordance with claim 1 and claim 6, the object of the invention was accomplished by
providing means to temporarily hold the two connectors in
a partially mated position, with the latching lugs of the
one connector aligned with the grooves of the sliding
latch, whereby the connectors can be temporarily held in
place, such that when the connectors are ready for mating,
only one hand is necessary to activate the sliding
latch to bring the two connectors into a finally locked
position.In the preferred embodiment
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (2) comprising a housing (4)
and a movable sliding latch (108) for interconnection with

a mating connector (6) having latching lugs (150)
thereupon, the sliding latch (108) having an open position for

receiving the latching lugs (150) as the mating connector
(6) is joined thereto and a closed position about the lugs

(150) when the connectors (2, 6) are fully seated,
characterized in that the latching lugs (150) cooperate

with the sliding latch (108) as the mating connector (6) is inserted
into the housing (4) to displace the sliding latch (108) to

a preliminary position, between the open position and the
closed position, where the mating connector (6) is

captivated to said electrical connector (2), by the latching lugs
(150) being retained in the sliding latch (108).
The electrical connector (2) of claim 1,
characterized in that the sliding latch (108) includes an entry

portion (134, 136), wherein the latching lugs (150) are
received when the sliding latch (108) is in the open position, the

entry portion (134, 136) having camming surfaces (134a,
134b, 136a, 136b) thereupon that cooperate with the

latching lugs (150) to displace the sliding latch (108) into the
preliminary position.
The electrical connector of claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the latching lugs (150) include

camming surfaces (150a, 150b) that cooperate with the
sliding latch to displace the sliding latch (108) to the

preliminary position.
The electrical connector (2) of any one of claims 1-3,
characterized in that the sliding latch (108) includes a

shoulder (134d, 136d) that prevents the latching lug (150)
from being withdrawn from the sliding latch (108) when the 

sliding latch (108) is in the preliminary position.
The electrical connector (2) of anyone of claims 1-4,
characterized in that the latching lug (150) includes a

shoulder (150f) that engages the sliding latch (108) when
the sliding latch (108) is in the preliminary position.
A sliding latch (108) for a electrical connector (2)
that is interconnectable with a mating connector (6)

having latching lugs (150) thereupon, said sliding
latch (108) being slidably disposed on a housing (4) of the

electrical connector (2) and having a camming groove (138,
140) with an entry portion (134, 136) for receiving the

latching lugs (150) of the mating connector (6) when the
sliding latch (108) is in an open position, where

displacement of the sliding latch (108) to a closed position
interconnects the electrical connector (2) and the mating

connector, characterized in that the entry portion (134,
136) includes camming surfaces (134a, 134b, 136a, 136b)

that cooperate with the latching lugs (150) as they are
received in the entry portion (134, 136) to deflect the

sliding latch (108) to a preliminary position retaining the
lugs (150) therein.
The sliding latch (108) of claim 6, characterized in
that the camming groove (138, 140) includes a shoulder

(134d, 136d) adjacent to he entry portion (134, 136) and,
when the sliding latch (108) is displaced to the preliminary

position, the shoulder (134d, 136d) prevents the latching
lug (150) from being withdrawn from the entry portion,

(134, 136) thereby retaining the two connectors (2, 6)
together.
