Device for aligning the base rings (3) of gas bottles (1), which has at least two tools 
parts (10, 10a; 19, 19a) fitted to a machine frame (6), of which tool parts at least one 

first tool part (10, 10a) forms an inner tool part with an inner tool face (12') and at 
least one tool part (19, 91a) forms an outer tool part with an outer tool face (20, 20a) 

which is formed convex in relation to the device axis (V), this outer tool face facing 
the inner tool face (12'), by means of at least one activating element (23, 26) with 

which the inner and outer tool parts (10, 10a; 19, 19a) are movable relative to one 
another in the manner of chucking j
aws, for the purpose of closing and opening the 
tool formed by the tool parts, with the tool parts forming between their tool faces (12', 

20, 20a) an operating gap which is open at one top or front face of the tool for the 
insertion of the base ring (3), the inner tool part forming an inner tool face (12') which 

is formed convex relative to a device axis (V), the tool parts forming between 
themselves a ring-shaped operating gap, and with a further activating element (22) 

being provided in order to move the at least one inner tool part (10, 10a) in the 
direction of the device axis (V) between a starting position and an end position,
characterised by the fact that
 
the at least one inner tool part (10, 10a) has, on an outer side (12) forming the inner 

tool face (12'), a recess (15) which, undercut, is formed in such a way that the inner 
tool face (12'), at its edge which leads, during the stroke movement, from the starting 

position to the end position, changes into a nose or a nose-like shaping zone (17) to 
effect shaping of an inwards-bent edge zone (4) of the base ring (3).  

 
Device in accordance with claim 1, characterised by the fact that the at least one 
activating element for opening and closing the tool and/or the at least one 

activating element for the stroke movement is a hydraulic cylinder (22, 23, 26). 
Device in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterised by the fact that the device 
axis is a vertical axis (V). 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised by the fact that 
the recess (15), on its side opposite to the nose (17), forms a slanting or conical 

surface (16), which, in the direction of the stroke movement of the inner tool part 
(10, 10a) from the starting position to the end position, has an increasing distance 

from the device axis (V). 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised by the fact that 
the inner tool face (12') has, in the direction of the stroke, a width which is 

smaller than the corresponding width of the outer tool face (20, 20a). 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised by the fact that 
on the outer tool face (20, 20a) a bend or a bent section (21, 21a) is provided for, 

which is bent concave in radial planes including the device axis (V), and directly 
opposite which lies the nose (17) in the end position of the stroke movement of the 

inner tool part (10, 10a). 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 6, characterised by the fact that 
the at least one inner tool part (10, 10a) and/or the at least one outer tool part (19, 

19a), are shaped like a ring segment at least in the area of the tool faces (12', 
20).  

 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised by the fact that 
several inner tool parts (10a) are envisaged, distributed around the device axis (V). 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 8, characterised by the fact that 
the outer tool part (19a) forms a closed, ring-shaped tool face (20). 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 9, characterised by the fact that 
the inner tool part (10, 10a) has a nose-like shaping zone which, in a cross-section 

plane including the device axis (V), has a convex cross section curved in the shape 
of an arc of a circle.
