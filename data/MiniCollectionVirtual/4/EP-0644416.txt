<ABSTRACT>
The present invention offers a method and an apparatus 
for flow type particle image analysis wherein a pulse light 

emission is generated in any one of the odd and the even field 
image reading out period and the multiple exposure is 

prevented by prohibiting the next pulse light emission in the 
predetermined period after the emission. The method of the 

present invention comprises the steps of flowing sample liquid 
in a flow cell, detecting particles passing through the flow 

cell by laser beam, making a flash lamp emit light after the 
predetermined period from the particle detection, picking up 

a particle still image by a TV camera and further preventing 
the multiple exposure by providing emission prohibiting 

periods which are established by controlling the timings of 
flash lamp emission and image transfer with the TV camera, a 

flash lamp emission control circuit and an image processing 
control circuit which are controlled by a central control 

part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for flow type particle image analysis which picks
up still images of particles suspending in a sample liquid
flow and analyzes the particles picked up in the images,
particularly adequate to the particle image analysis of cells
or particles in urine or blood.Conventionally, analyzing and classifying corpuscles in
blood or cells and particles in urine is done by observing a
sample applied on a slide glass with a microscope. In case of
urine, since the density of particles is low in urine, a
sample is observed after enriched by a centrifugal separator.The observation and inspection of particles is automated
by using an apparatus in which such a sample as a drop of
blood is set at a stage of a microscope after applied on a
slide glass and the stage of the microscope is automatically
scanned. Then, the scanning is stopped at the position where
the presence of particles is found, and a still image of the
particles is picked up. And the particles in the still image
are analyzed and classified by a feature extraction means and
a pattern recognition means used in an image processing 
technique.The above-mentioned observation and inspection needs much
time for making a sample and difficult work for finding
particles by mechanically moving the stage of a microscope and
moving the particles into an adequate view position of an
image pickup region, whereby then much time for analysis and
a complicate mechanical structure of the apparatus are needed.As another conventional technique, a flow cytometer
method is known. The method optically analyzes a sample which
is not applied on a slide glass but flowed in a flow cell
where the particles are suspended in the flowing sample.The method using the flow cytometer observes the strength
of fluorescence or scattered light from each particle in the
sample and has the ability of analyzing thousands of particles
a second.However, it is difficult to observe feature parameters
reflecting morphological feature of a particle by the method.
Therefore, the method can not classify particles based on the
morphological feature as the conventional method can do by
using a microscope.As a technique of analyzing and classifying each particle
image in a picked up still image of particles in continuous
sample flow, techniques described in National Publication for
Japan No.500995/1982, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open
No.94156/1988 and No.72554/1992 are known.The technique described in National Publication for Japan
No.500995
