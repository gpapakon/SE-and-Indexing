<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a polycarbonate copolymer (Fig. 3) of a 
spirobisindan (6,6'-dihydroxy-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-1,1'-spirobisindan) and bisphenol-A 

in which the mole fraction of the spirobisindan α ranges between 0.844 and 0.887. Such 
a copolymer has a stress-optical coefficient C
m
 in the melt which is equal to zero or 
substantially equal to zero, so that the sensitivity of the polymer to orientation 

birefringence is very small. Such a copolymer can be rendered optically isotropic and is 
very suitable for use in optical components in which birefringence is undesirable. 

Examples of such optical components are lenses and substrates for optical information 
media.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polycarbonate copolymer of spirobisindan and
bisphenol-A.The invention also relates to a method of preparing such a copolymer.The invention further relates to an optical component of such a
copolymer, in particular a substrate for an optical information carrier, notably a
substrate for a magneto-optical information carrier. The invention also relates to a
magneto-optical recording medium.Polycarbonate (PC) on the basis of 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, in
literature commonly referred to as bisphenol-A, is used in optical products because it
has excellent thermal and mechanical properties and a low water absorption. Moreover,
the material is transparent for a broad wavelength range. Products such as substrates for
optical information carriers are generally manufactured by injection moulding or
compression moulding polycarbonate at an increased temperature (at least above the
glass-transition temperature Tg). Said moulding process causes the polycarbonate to
become anisotropic. This is because, during injection moulding or compression
moulding of polycarbonate, large pressure and temperature gradients develop which lead
to molecular orientation and stresses. During cooling in the mould, said stresses and
molecular orientations are frozen-in, so that the polycarbonate becomes optically
anisotropic. This manifests itself in birefringence of the material. In a birefringent
material a light ray is split into two plane-polarized light rays (referred to as ordinary
and extraordinary ray) whose planes of polarization extend perpendicularly to each
other. Both light rays have a different refractive index in the material. The difference in
refractive index Δn is referred to as birefringence. The difference in path length
between the ordinary and extraordinary light ray is referred to as optical retardation T
and is proportional to Δn. This birefringence leads to astigmatism of a light beam.
Birefringence is particularly disadvantageous in MO (magneto-optical) recording,
because reading of an MO medium is based on the detection of the very small (Kerr-)rotation
of the plane of polarization of a polarized laser light beam. It has been found that in the polymeric melt (temperature > Tg) the
birefringence (Δn) is proportional to the applied stress (Δσ):
Δn = Cm.Δσ
The stress-optical coefficient (Cm) is proportional to the anisotropy of the polymer
chains. The applied voltage causes the polymer chains to become oriented; the material
becomes anisotropic, which leads to birefrigence. Said
