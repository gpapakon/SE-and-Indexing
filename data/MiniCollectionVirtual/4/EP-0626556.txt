<ABSTRACT>
- The present invention relates to a system (1) for steering an aircraft which turns on itself and which is propelled by a propulsive jet, including a first movable interception member (9) which, during each rotation of the aircraft, is successively put into each of two different positions:   . an active position, in which it intercepts the said propulsive jet on a first interception surface (S1); and . a passive position, in which it is spaced away from the said propulsive jet.   - According to the invention, the said steering system (1) includes a second movable interception member (10), integral with the said first interception member (9) and configured in such a way that:   . in the said active position, it is spaced away from the said propulsive jet; and . in the said passive position, it intercepts the said propulsive jet on a second interception surface, smaller than the said first interception surface (S1).

<CLAIMS>
A steering system (1) for an aircraft rotating
about its longitudinal axis on itself and propelled by a

propulsive jet including a first mobile interceptor
member (9, 18) which, on each rotation of the aircraft,

assumes each of two different successive positions:

an active position in which it intercepts said
propulsive jet over a first interception area (S
1
); and
a passive position in which it is out of said
propulsive jet,

characterised in that

it includes a second mobile interceptor member
(10, 19) attached to said first inte
rceptor member (9,
18);
in said active position of said first mobile
interceptor member (9, 18) said second mobile interceptor

member (10, 19) is out of said propulsive jet; and
in said passive position of said first mobile
interceptor member (9, 18) said second mobile interceptor

member (10, 19) intercepts said propulsive jet over a
second interception area (S
2
) smaller than said first
interception area (S
1
).
A steering system according to claim 1
characterised in that it includes a mobile assembly (3)

carrying said first interception member (9, 18) and said
second interception member (10, 19).
A steering system according to claim 2
characterised in that said mobile assembly (3) is

rotatable about a rotation axis (4) by electromagnet
coils (7, 8).
A steering system according to any one of
claims 1 to 3 characterised in that said first

interceptor member (9) and said second interceptor member
(10) are identical and in that they are asymmetric

relative to said propulsive jet. 
A steering system according to any one of
claims 1 to 3 characterised in that said first

interceptor member (18) and said second interceptor
member (19) are different sizes.
