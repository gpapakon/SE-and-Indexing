<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
forming apparatus usable with a process cartridge
detachably mountable thereto, for forming an image on
a recording material as specified in the preamble of claim 1.The image forming apparatus includes, for
example, a laser beam printer, an LED printer, an
electrophotographic copying machine, a facsimile
machine, a word processor and the like.In an image forming apparatus such as a
printer, a uniformly charged image bearing member is
selectively exposed to light so that a latent image is
formed. The latent image is visualized with a toner
into a toner image, which is transferred onto a
recording material. In such an apparatus, the toner
has to be supplied each time the toner is used up.
The toner supplying operation is cumbersome, and also,
contamination results. Maintenance operation for
various members has to be performed by an expert
service man with the result of inconveniences of the
user.Under the circumstances, a proposal has been
made that the image bearing member, a charger, a
developing device, a cleaning device or the like are
unified into a cartridge, which is loaded into the 
main assembly by the user, by which the toner supply,
the exchange of members such as image bearing member
having reached the end of the service life, can be all
together exchanged, thus facilitating the maintenance
operation. The process cartridge is disclosed in U.S.
Patents Nos. 3,985,436, 4,500,195, 4,540,268,
4,627,701 and so on. As for such an image forming
apparatus usable with the process cartridge, a
cartridge mounting portion is provided in an openable
member which is openable relative to the main
assembly. After the cartridge is set to the mounting
portion, the openable member is closed, as disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,873,548.In such an apparatus, the cartridge is
required to be fixed to prevent play of the cartridge
when the openable member is closed. However, with the
structure in which the process cartridge is set to the
openable member, a large space is required by a member
urging the cartridge in the main apparatus.When the member is closed, a drum gear of the
image bearing member and a driving gear of the main
assembly for transmitting driving force to the image
bearing member, are meshed. At this time, the
direction of the meshing pressure angle between the
gears is required to be directed downwardly beyond a
horizontal axis. With this structure, when the member
is opened and the cartridge is taken out, the 
engagement between the gears prevents the

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus (A) for forming an image
on a recording medium (P) and usable with a detachably

mountable process cartridge (B) comprising an
electrophotographic photosensitive member (2), and

process means (3,4,5) actable on the photosensitive
member (2), said image forming apparatus comprising:


a main assembly (6);
support means (7a1,7b1) for detachably supporting
such a process cartridge in the operative position in the

main assembly;
a cover (16b) openable to allow the process
cartridge to be inserted into the main assembly, and

closable when the process cartridge is supported by the
support means;
a first pressing member (18a) mounted on the
cover for pressing the process cartridge towards its

operative position when the process cartridge is
supported by the support means (7a1,7b1) and the cover

is closed; and
means (11) for feeding a recording material past
said photosensitive member when the process cartridge is

mounted in the main assembly;

   
characterised by
:

a second pressing member (18b) mounted on the main
assembly operable to press the process cartridge towards

its operative position when the process cartridge is 
supported by the support means (7a1,7b1) and the cover

(16b) is closed.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second
pressing member includes a plate spring (18b) which when

the cover (16b) is moved into its closed position after
the process cartridge (B) has been inserted is pressed

into contact with the process cartridge (B) so as to press
the process cartridge (B) to its operative position.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the distance
