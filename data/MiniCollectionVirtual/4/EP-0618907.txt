<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 1-(arylalkyl-aminoalkyl)imidazole
compounds having therapeutic
activity useful in treating conditions associated with
inflammation or allergy, to therapeutic compositions
containing these novel compounds and to processes for
preparing these novel compounds.It is believed that, in response to an inflammatory
stimulus, phospholipase enzymes are activated leading to
the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids.
Existing non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIA)
are believed to act primarily by blocking the conversion
of this released arachidonic acid into prostaglandins
via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid
cascade. Many existing NSAIA are unsuitable for use by
asthmatics. We have found a series of compounds which
act to block the release of arachidonic acid from
phospholipids. These compounds are indicated as useful
antiinflammatory compounds with a potentially broader
spectrum of activity than existing NSAIA, and
potentially fewer gastro-intestinal side-effects. In
addition the compounds may be useful in the treatment of
asthma.Compound A is disclosed in I1 Farmaco, 44 (5), 495-502,
1989 as having an inhibitory effect on platelet
aggregation in vitro.Compound B is disclosed as a chemical intermediate
in EP 0230035. No pharmacological activity is disclosed
for this compound.
GB 2088888 discloses desensitizing compositions for
photographic developers comprising imidazoles of formula
C

wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a C1-20 alkyl
group or a C6-20 aryl group; R2 represents a hydrogen
atom, a C1-20 alkyl group, a C6-20 aryl group, an amino
group, or a C1-20 alkylthio group; and R3 and R4, which
may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen
atom, a C1-4 alkyl group, or a C6-20 aryl group; and R1,
R2, R3 and R4 may be substituted. 1-(6-Benzylaminohexyl)-2-methylimidazole
is disclosed. No
pharmacological activity is disclosed for this compound.More distantly related compounds of formula D

in which the ring incorporating N and Z represents
dialkylamino, morpholine or piperidino are disclosed in
the Indian Journal of Pharmacology 1973, 5, 428 and Pfl. 
Krankh. 1975, 3, 149. These compounds are disclosed as
potential central nervous system depressants. N-[2-(4-Morpholino)propyl]-α-ethyl-3,4-dichlorobenzylamine
is
alleged to have antiinflammatory activity but has a wide
range of undesirable side-effects in mice.EP 0117462 discloses the use of compounds of
formula E

in which A is inter alia a divalent moiety of formula
-CnH2n- where n
