<ABSTRACT>
A water level regulating system controlling the 
water level of a head tank of each of a plurality of 

hydroelectric plant installed in cascade along a 
stream by using an opening of guide vanes (201, 203) 

of a hydraulic turbine (202, 204) as a manipulated 
variable, and the water level of the head tank as a 

controlled variable. Each hydroelectric plant has a 
water level regulator (100A, 100B) constituting the 

water level regulating system. Each of the water 
level regulator (100A) of an upstream hydroelectric 

plant and the water level regulator (100B) of a 
downstream hydroelectric plant has a device (103, 

106) varying PID parameters for controlling the 
water level in accordance with the opening (₁, ₂) 

of the guide vanes (201, 203), and a device (101, 
104) varying a reference water level (Sv
1'
, Sv
2'
) to 
a set water level (Sv₁, Sv₂). The downstream water 

level regulator (100B) further includes a 
feedforward compensating element (107) which 

compensates a feedforward signal corresponding to 
the opening (₁) of the guide vanes (201) of the 

upstream hydroelectric plant, and which varies its 
compensation characteristic by the opening (₂) of 

the guide vanes of the downstream hydroelectric 
plant. This arrangement makes it possible to 

quickly stabilize the water level of the head tank 
which may vary owing to changes in the operating 

state of the turbines or in an intake volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water level 
regulating system including a plurality of water 
level regulators, each of which controls the water 
level of a head tank of individual hydroelectric 
plants installed in cascade along a water system. A conventional water level regulator controls 
the water level of a head tank by the feedback 
control. The feedback control is carried out by a 
PID control using the opening of guide vanes of a 
hydraulic turbine as a manipulated variable, and the 
water level of the head tank as a controlled 
variable. Generally, the parameters of the PID 
control are fixed. When a plurality of power plants are installed 
in cascade along a water system, each power plant is 
provided with a water level regulator that performs 
the PID control. Fig. 1 shows a system which includes a plurality 
of tanks installed in cascade. In this figure, TK1 
designates an upstream head tank, TK2 designates an 
upstream surge tank, TK3 designates a downstream 
head tank, TK4 designates a downstream surge tank, 
TKn designates an n-th tank, GV1 designates guide 
vanes of an upstream power plant, and GV2 designates 
guide vanes of a downstream power plant. In this 
system, a transfer characteristic of change in water  
 
level of each tank has nonlinear characteristics 
because the time constant of the transfer 
characteristic changes depending on the volume of 
water flowing through the water system. This will be described in more detail. First, a 
basic characteristic equation indicating the 
relationship between the water level of a tank and 
the discharge (the rate of flow) is expressed as 
follows: 
AidHidt = Qi - Qi+1    (i = 1 ··· n - 1)  
where Qi is the rate of inflow to a tank i, Hi is 
the water level, and Ai is the surface area of the 
tank i. The rate of flow through a pipe is expressed by 
the following equation of motion. 
γ·Si·LigdVidt = γ·Si . (Hi-1 - Hi - kiVi 2)(i = 2, 4, ···n-1)  
where γ is the density of fluid, Si is the cross-sectional 
area of a pipe i, Li is the length of the 
pipe i, Vi is the velocity of flow in the pipe i, ki 
is the friction factor of the pipe i, and g is the 
acceleration of gravity. Performing Laplace transform after substituting 
SiVi = Qi in equation (2), and expanding equation (2) 
into a Taylor series at a neighborhood of a 
reference value Qi0 of Qi, gives equation (3). 
(2kiQioSi 2 + LigSis) Qi = Hi-1 - HiThe water level H1(s) of the upstream head tank 
TK1 and the water level H3(s) of the downstream head 
tank TK3 of Fig. 1 are
