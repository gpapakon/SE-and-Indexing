<ABSTRACT>
A differential drive mechanism comprises a cage (8), 
which is rotatable about an axis (6) and represents the 

input, two coaxial output shafts (2,4) which are 
rotatable with respect to the cage (8) about the said 

axis (6), a coupling (16) which is connected 
eccentrically to the two output shafts (2,4) to transmit 

relative contra-rotational movement between them by 
connections which permit relative rotation of the 

coupling (16) and the output shafts (2,4) about an axis 
(14) substantially parallel to the said axis (6) and a 

restraint member (20) which is coupled to the cage (8) 
and to the coupling (16) such that the coupling (16) is 

rotatable with respect to the cage (8) about an axis 
substantially perpendicular to the said axis (6) and 

capable of reciprocating movement in a direction 
perpendicular to the said axis (6) but prevented from 

movement in a direction parallel to the said axis (6). 
The eccentric connection of the coupling (16) and the 

output shafts (2,4) is constituted by a respective 
eccentric hole (12) in the inner end (10) of each output 

shaft (2,4) in which the associated end of the coupling 
(16) is received. The inner end (10) of each output 

shaft (2,4) is in sliding engagement with the inner 
surface of the cage (8) whereby as the cage (8) rotates 

about the said axis (6) the sliding surface on the inner 
end (10) of each output shaft (2,4) is pressed by the 

coupling (16) into contact with the opposing sliding 
surface on the cage (8) so that a proportion of the 
input 
torque transmitted to the cage (8) is transmitted 

directly to the output shafts (2,4) through the 
cooperating sliding surfaces and does not pass through 

the coupling (16) and restraint member (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to differential drive
mechanisms, particularly automotive differentials of
limited slip type, and is concerned with that type of
differential drive mechanism whcih comprises a cage,
which is rotatable about an axis and represents the
input, two coaxial output shafts which are received in
respective holes in the cage and are rotatable with
respect to the cage about the said axis and have inner
ends within the cage, a coupling which is connected
eccentrically to the two output shafts to transmit
relative contra-rotational movement between them by
connections which permit relative rotation of the
coupling and the output shafts about an axis
substantially parallel to the said axis and a restraint
member which is coupled to the cage and to the coupling
such that the coupling is rotatable with respect to the
cage about an axis substantially perpendicular to the
said axis and capable of reciprocating movement in a
direction perpendicular to the said axis but prevented
from movement in a direction parallel to the said axis,
the eccentric connection of the coupling and the output
shafts including a respective eccentric hole formed in
the inner end of each output shaft in which the
associated end of the coupling is received, the ends of
the coupling having a part-spherical engagement surface,
a sleeve which affords a complementary part-spherical
internal surface being received in each eccentric hole
and each engagement surface being in engagement with a
respective complementary internal surface.Conventional automotive differentials provide a cost
effective means of sharing torque equally between the
driven wheels. However, the characteristic of always
providing equal torque restricts the total to the level 
which maintains traction at the wheels with minimum grip.
If this is close to zero, e.g. due to the fact that one
wheel is on very slippery ground, then the total will
also be very low even if one wheel has very good grip.To overcome this disadvantage, various types of limited 
slip differential have been used of either the speed
control or torque control type. The speed control type
senses wheel slip after it occurs by the speed difference
and transfers torque to the slower wheel accordingly.
The torque control type transfers torque from the faster
moving wheel before traction is lost.Various types of torque control automotive differential
are known but substantially all of those which are
actually used comprise a substantial number of meshing
helical gears or alternatively face

<CLAIMS>
A differential drive mechanism comprising a cage
(8), which is rotatable about an axis (6) and represents

the input, two coaxial output shafts (2,4) which are
received in respective holes in the cage and are

rotatable with respect to the cage (8) about the said
axis (6) and have inner ends (10) within the cage, a

coupling (16) which is connected eccentrically to the two
output shafts (2,4) to transmit relative contra-rotational

movement between them by connections (12,22,
24) which permit relative rotation of the coupling (16)

and the output shafts (2,4) about an axis (14) substantially
parallel to the said axis (6) and a restraint

member (20) which is coupled to the cage (8) and to the
coupling (16) such that the coupling (16) is rotatable

with respect to the cage (8) about an axis substantially
perpendicular to the said axis (6) and capable of reciprocating

movement in a direction perpendicular to the
said axis (6) but prevented from movement in a direction

parallel to the said axis (6), the eccentric connection
of the coupling (16) and the output shafts (2,4)

including a respective eccentric hole (12) formed in the
inner end (10) of each output shaft (2,4) in which the

associated end of the coupling (16) is received, the ends
of the coupling (16) having a part-spherical engagement

surface, a sleeve (24) which affords a complementary
part-spherical internal surface being received in each

eccentric hole (12) and each engagement surface being in
engagement with a respective complementary internal

surface, characterised in that the inner end (10) of each
output shaft (2,4) has an external surface which

constitutes a sliding surface in sliding engagement with
an opposed portion of the inner surface of the cage (8),

which constitutes a sliding surface, and that the
clearance between the said sliding surfaces is less than

that between the output shaft (2,4) and the edges of the
holes in the cage in which they are received, whereby as

the cage (8) rotates about the said axis (6) 
the sliding surface on the inner end (10) of each output

shaft (2,4) is pressed by the coupling (16) into contact
with the opposed sliding surface on the cage (8) so that

a proportion of the input torque transmitted to the cage
(8) is transmitted directly to the output shafts (2,4)

through the cooperating sliding surfaces.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1 characterised in
that each sleeve (24) is slidable within the associated

eccentric hole (12) in rotation and parallel to the said
axis (6).
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1 characterised in
that each sleeve (24) is slidable within the associated

eccentric hole (12) in rotation but is restrained so as
to be fixed parallel to the said axis (6).
A mechanism as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the cooperating sliding

surfaces are subjected to a treatment consisting of
phosphation and/or nitridation and/or heat treatment to

increase their abrasion resistance.
A mechanism as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the coupling (16) and the

restraint member (20) constitute respective bars which
extend substantially perpendicular to one another.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 5 characterised in
that the coupling (16) and the restraint member (20) are

integral and thus constitute a single cruciform member,
the ends of the restraint member (20) being

longitudinally slidably and rotatably coupled to the cage
(8). 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 5 characterised in
that the ends of the restraint member (20) are fixedly

coupled to the cage (8), that the coupling (16) defines
a hole and that a central portion of the restraint member

(20) is received rotatably and longitudinally slidably in
the hole in the coupling (16).
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1 characterised in
that the coupling constitutes a spur gear (37) carrying

teeth and two transmission members (30) which are coupled
to respective output shafts (2,4) to be rotatable with

respect to them about an axis parallel to but offset from
the said axis (6) and carry rack teeth (36) on their

inner surfaces directed towards one another which extend
in a direction perpendicular to the said axis (6) and are

in mesh with the teeth on the spur gear (37), whereby
rotation of the spur gear (37) about an axis

perpendicular to the said axis (6) tends to cause
movement of the two transmission members (30) in opposite

directions perpendicular to the said axis (6), that the
spur gear (37) is carried by a restraint bar (20) which

constitutes the restraint member and extends
perpendicular to the said axis (6), that the ends of the

restraint member (20) are coupled to the cage (8) so as
to be rotatable about and movable parallel to its length

and that carrier means (38) is provided which prevent
relative movement perpendicular to the said axis (6) of

the teeth on the spur gear (37) and the rack teeth (36),
whereby as differential rotation of the output shafts

(2,4) occurs the spur gear (37) and the restraint bar
(20) reciprocate in rotation about the length of the

restraint bar (20) and linearly in the direction of the
length of the restraint bar (20). 
A mechanism as claimed in claim 8 characterised in
that the spur gear (37) is discontinuous along the length

of the restraint bar (20) and is divided into two
portions by a peripheral shoulder (38), that the rack

teeth (37) are also divided into two portions in mesh
with respective portions of the spur gear and that the

inner ends of the two rack teeth portions are situated
adjacent the shoulder (38) whereby relative movement of

the rack teeth (30) and the spur gear (37) in a direction
perpendicular to the said axis (6) is prevented.
