<ABSTRACT>
An antilock modulator which can maintain a short 
brake pedal stroke during normal braking operations, which 

improves the pedal feeling during antilock control, and 
which can prevent unnecessary increase in the pump 

discharge pressure. The antilock modulator has a main 
fluid line (9) connecting the wheel brake (1) to the master 

cylinder (3) and a line branching from the main fluid line and 
leading to the discharge end of the hydraulic pump (6). At the 

branching point is provided a differential pressure-responsive 
means (11) which shuts off fluid communication 

between the master cylinder (3) and the discharge end of the 
pump (6) when the pressure difference between the wheel brake (1) 

and the master cylinder (3) exceeds a predetermined value and 
otherwise allows fluid communication therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antilock modulator for 
use in an automotive brake system. Fig. 5 shows a conventional circulation type 
antilock device comprising a reservoir 2 for storing brake 
fluid discharged from a wheel brake 1 during antilock 
control, a single or a plurality of pairs of 
electromagnetic control valves 4, 5 for controlling the 
brake pressure on the wheel during antilock by selectively 
connecting the wheel brake 1 to a main fluid line 9 leading 
to a master cylinder 3 or a discharge line 10 leading to a 
reservoir 2 in response to control signals, and a hydraulic 
pump 6 for sucking and pressurizing the brake fluid in the 
reservoir 2 to return it to a fluid return point of the 
main fluid line. The circulation type antilock device shown in Fig. 5 
has a problem in that the hydraulic fluid discharged from 
the wheel brake 1 while the brake pressure is being reduced 
during antilock control mode is returned toward the master 
cylinder by the pump 6, so that a brake pedal 7 and the 
pipings tend to vibrate due to the pulsation of the pump, 
thus producing much noise. An antilock device which is free of this problem is 
proposed e.g. in Examined Japanese Patent Publication 61-33738.  
 
This device has a first check valve provided in the 
main fluid line between the fluid return point and the 
master cylinder to allow only a fluid flow from the master 
cylinder toward the control valves, a second check valve 
provided in a bypass line connecting the wheel brake to the 
master cylinder to allow only a fluid flow toward the 
master cylinder, and an accumulator provided at the outlet 
side of pump. Since the brake fluid discharged from the 
pump is accumulated in the accumulator, the pump pulsation 
decreases. But for this device, a rather large accumulator is 
needed, so that the entire device tends to be bulky and 
costly. Also, since the wheel brake pressure never drops 
below the pressure necessary to open the second check 
valve, brake dragging will occur. Examined Japanese Patent Publication 61-54619 
discloses an improved arrangement in which a pressure-adjusting 
valve is used in place of the accumulator, which 
acts to discharge pressure fluid pumped out from the 
hydraulic pump into the reservoir when the pressure of the 
pumped-out fluid becomes higher by a predetermined value 
than the fluid pressure produced in the master cylinder. An antilock device proposed in Examined Japanese 
Patent Publication 61-16656 employs, in place of the 
above-described first check valve, a

An antilock modulator comprising: 

a reservoir (2) for storing brake fluid discharged from a 
wheel brake (1) during antilock control; 
a control valve (5) for controlling the brake pressure for 
said wheel brake (1) by selectively connecting said wheel 

brake to said reservoir (2) and a main fluid line (9) leading 
to a master cylinder (3); 
a pump (6) for sucking brake fluid from said reservoir (2) 
and returning it under pressure to a return point of said 

main fluid line (9); 
a shutoff means (14) provided in said main fluid line (9) 
between said return point and said master cylinder (3) for 

checking the fluid flow from said pump (6) toward said master 
cylinder (3); and 
a relief valve (15) for directing the brake fluid discharged 
from said pump (6) toward said reservoir (2) when the discharge 

pressure of said pump (6) exceeds a predetermined 
level;

said shutoff means (14) comprises a pressure-responsive piston 
(12) having a first end for receiving the pressure in a 

brake line leading from said control valve (5) to said wheel 
brake (1) and a second end for receiving the pressure in a 

brake line leading from said master cylinder (3) to said  
 

control valve (5), said piston (12) being movable between an 
original position and an operative position and adapted to 

remain in said original position while the difference between

valve (16) for feeding brake fluid at a constant flow rate 
from said upstream side toward said downstream side irrespective 

of said pressure difference while the brake pressure is

pressure-responsive means which makes it possible to change 
the relief pressure of said relief valve according to the
