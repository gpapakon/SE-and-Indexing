<ABSTRACT>
A conditioning shampoo containing an anionic 
cleansing surfactant, in an amount of about 5% to about 

65% by weight, preferably about 5% to about 25% by 
weight, e.g., (C
12
-C
22
) alkyl sulfate, and/or a long 
chain (C
12
-C
22
) partially or fully ethoxylated alkyl 
sulfate, and/or a long chain (C
12
-C
22
) alkyl sulfonate, 
and a combination of cationic polymers comprising (1) a 

cationic (protonated) polyethyleneimine in an amount of 
about 0.1% to about 4% by weight, preferably about 0.1% 

to about 1% by weight, and (2) a cationic oil-soluble, 
water-dispersible, cross-linked quaternary 

acrylate/acrylamide copolymer (Polyquaternium 32), in 
an amount of about 0.1% 
to about 20% by weight of the 
composition, provides excellent foaming, conditioning 

and stability, without settling of water-insoluble 
materials due to anionic-cationic complexing. The 

composition preferably also includes one or more 
silicone conditioning agents, and has extended product 

stability, excellent overall conditioning to human 
hair, particularly superior wet and dry combing 

properties, and unexpectedly maintains very high levels 
of foam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a hair
conditioning shampoo composition and to a method of
treating hair with the composition to provide the hair
with improved wet stage and dry stage conditioning
properties as well as other conditioning properties,
such as softness, without residual build-up of
conditioning agents on the hair. The conditioning
shampoo also thoroughly cleanses the hair, while
conditioning, with a cleansing detergent that develops
an unexpectedly high foam level and unexpected
stability containing an anionic detergent, a protonated
(cationic) polyethyleneimine conditioning agent and,
optionally, one or more silicone conditioning agents.
More particularly, the present invention is directed to
a hair conditioning shampoo composition including one
or more anionic cleansing surfactants, such as ammonium
lauryl sulfate or ammonium lauryl ether sulfate (ALES),
a protonated polyethyleneimine, and an
acrylate/acrylamide copolymer conditioning agent that
is stable over extended periods of time at elevated
temperature. Surprisingly, the composition develops
copious amounts of foam for a conditioning shampoo
while achieving excellent conditioning benefits, and is
unexpectedly stable while having a combination of a
strong anionic cleansing detergent, such as a long
chain alkyl sulfate, or a partially ethoxylated long
chain alkyl sulfate or sulfonate together with a
cationic polyethyleneimine and a silicone conditioning
agent. The anionic surfactant/cationic
polyethyleneimine conditioning agent components are
compatible and stable while developing surprisingly
high amounts of foam without the problem of anionic
surfactant-cationic conditioning agent incompatibility.Soiled human hair is shampooed to remove
sebum that is naturally secreted by the head as well as
soil and other atmospheric contaminants that accumulate
on the hair. Sebum, in particular, accumulates on the
hair in a relatively short period of time leaving the
hair with a greasy, dirty feel and poor manageability.
The most effective shampoos for cleansing the hair for
removal of the atmospheric contaminants and sebum, are
those that contain high lather synthetic anionic
detergents, such as the long chain alkyl sulfates, the
partially ethoxylated long chain alkyl sulfates and the
long chain sulfonates. These synthetic anionic
detergents are very effective for cleansing the hair
but, after rinsing with water, leave the hair with a
dried touch,usually called "creak" and result in hair,
when wet, that is in an extremely tangled and
unmanag

including a silicone conditioning agent in an amount of

about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of the composition.
