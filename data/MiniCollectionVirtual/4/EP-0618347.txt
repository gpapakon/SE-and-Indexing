<ABSTRACT>
A system for sensing the passage of a member (6) 
past a predetermined location along a tubing (4) disposed in 

an oil or gas well comprises a magnet (16) connected to the 
member (6). the magnet preferably having a soft body so that 

the magnet can be drilled out by a drill bit lowered into 
the well after the member has passed the predetermined 

location; and a sensor (18), connected to the outside of the 
tubing (4) at the predetermined location, for detecting a 

magnetic field of the magnet as the member (6) with the 
magnet connected thereto passes the sensor (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a system and 
method for cement placement in a well by sensing the passage 
of a member past a predetermined location along a tubing 
disposed in an oil or gas well. Various objects may need to be dropped or pumped into an 
oil or gas well during its creation and completion. For 
example, when a casing or liner is installed in a well 
borehole, two cementing plugs may be released on either end of 
(one in front of and one after) a cement slurry that is pumped 
through a tubing (which can include the casing or liner 
itself) into the well. The first, lower cementing plug 
separates the cementing slurry from the drilling mud or other 
fluid already in the well, and this first plug drops into the 
lower part of the well when it reaches the lower end of the 
tubing (more specifically, it typically lands on a float 
collar). The second, upper cementing plug separates the 
cement slurry from a spacer or other following fluid pumped 
behind the cement slurry to push it around the lower end of 
the tubing and up the annulus between the casing or liner and 
an outer tubular or the wall of the borehole. These cementing 
plugs are typically made of a relatively soft material so that 
they can be readily drilled out by a conventional drill bit as 
the depth of the well is increased after the casing or liner 
has been set.  It is important to know whether the cementing plugs have 
properly released into the flow stream because if they have 
not, unwanted mixing between the cement slurry and other 
fluids can occur, and improper placement of the cement slurry 
in the well and improper bonding of the casing or liner can 
result. This need to detect proper release of cementing plugs 
has been known and attempts to satisfy it have been proposed 
or made. Although various types of detectors for detecting the 
passage of objects, such as cementing plugs, in tubing 
disposed in oil or gas wells have been disclosed, these types 
are not necessarily reliably sensitive to the particular 
object that is to be monitored. For example, a mechanical 
type of detector may become fouled (such as by becoming 
cemented) and non-functional in the harsh oil or gas well 
environment where it is used. As an example of another 
shortcoming, a type of detector that includes a metallic 
member mounted on the object may create a drill-out problem if 
the metallic member is made of a material that cannot be 
readily drilled by conventional drill bits used in oil or gas 
wells. In view of at least these

A system for assisting the proper placement of a 
cement slurry in an oil or gas well, which system comprises 

a cementing plug (6) adapted to be released into a tubing 
(4) adjacent a cement slurry pumped into the well through 

the tubing (4); magnetic means (16), connected to said 
cementing plug (6), for establishing a permanent magnetic 

field at said cementing plug (6); and sensor means (18), 
connected to the tubing (4), for sensing the magnetic field
