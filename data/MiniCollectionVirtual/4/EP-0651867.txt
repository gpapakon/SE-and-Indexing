<ABSTRACT>
To obviate finishing work, preforms are designed to have no troublesome surface anomalies and thus to constitute the finished ring (10). This is done, depending on whether the preform has just two circumferential parting lines (14) or has sprue points (18) as well, by recessing each parting line (14) in one of two grooves (12) or by recessing one parting line (14) in one of two grooves (12) and all sprue points (18) in the other groove (16), with the other parting line remaining, as in the known art, in a non-sealing surface region.

A rubber-like O-ring seal 
with two circumferential separation ridges (14) each on 

one of two sealing surfaces, 
characterised
 
in that each separation ridge (14) is recessed in one of 

two circumferential grooves (12). 
A thermoplastic-elastic sealing ring with a 
predominantly round profile, having two circumferential 

non-diametric separation ridges (14) each on one of two 
surface halves and having at least one injection nodule 

(18) on the surface, 
characterised
 in that 
one of the two separation ridges (14) and all injection 

nodules (18) are recessed each in one of two 
circumferential grooves (12) or recesses (16). 
A sealing ring as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the two grooves (12) lie 

diametrically opposite one another. 
A sealing ring as claimed in claim 3, characterised 
in that the two grooves (12) run radially on the interior 

or exterior. 
A sealing ring as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the two circumferential edges (20) 

of at least one groove (12) are designed as sealing lips. 
A sealing ring as claimed in one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the groove containing an injection 

nodule is shortened to a surface recess (16) for each 
injection nodule. 
Use of the sealing ring as claimed in one of claims  
 

1 to 6, characterised in that at least one groove (12) or 
recess (16) is used to receive a lubricant.
