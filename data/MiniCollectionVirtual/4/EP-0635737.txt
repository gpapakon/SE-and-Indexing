<ABSTRACT>
A device is provided having an optical glass fibre (16) bonded 
to a silicon 

substrate (2) via a brazed bond (18). The bond completely seals the fibre 
(16) within an alignment groove (8). A cover (not shown) is provided 

such that the device can be evacuated. The brazed bond does not 
outgas and hence a high vacuum can be maintained w
ithin the device. 
The brazing alloy comprises at least one of titanium, zirconium, 

chromium, aluminium and vanadium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device having brazed bonds and a 
method of manufacture thereof. Micro machined resonant sensors consist of a thin silicon bridge or 
cantilever formed over a substrate, such as silicon. The bridge or 
cantilever has a resonant frequency which, for instance, is a function of 
the temperature and/or pressure experienced by the sensor. The bridge 
or cantilever typically has a resonant frequency of about 100KHz with 
quality (Q) factors of up to 100000. Such sensors may be driven, and 
the vibration of the bridge or cantilever sensed, by optical means. This 
provides a sensor with good immunity to electrical noise and which may 
operate at extremes of temperature eg - 50°C to 300°C. In order to obtain the high Q values available, the bridge or cantilever 
must oscillate in a substantially evacuated environment, so as to 
minimise damping due to viscous drag. This requires that the entry of 
the optical fibre into the sensor must be fluid sealed so as to prevent the 
vacuum being lost. Known fixing methods have been found to be not entirely suitable. The 
seal between the fibre and the sensor must not compromise the vacuum. 
Thus materials which outgas, either during manufacture or during the 
subsequent life of the sensor, are not suitable. This constraint rules out 
many adhesives and epoxy resins.  The sensors may be subjected to high temperatures. The devices are 
suitable for use in temperatures of up to three hundred degrees 
centigrade. In addition, the manufacturing of the sensors may involve 
the use of anodic bonding techniques which require temperatures of 
about four hundred and fifty degrees centigrade. High temperature 
optical fibres and their coatings are able to withstand temperatures of the 
order of seven hundred and fifty degrees centigrade or greater without 
sustaining damage. Thus the seal must be able to withstand temperatures 
of at least four hundred and fifty degrees centigrade and be makable at 
temperatures below those at which damage to the optical fibre or the 
coating thereof may occur. This constraint restricts the use of many 
solders and adhesives. There is also a requirement for good thermal matching at the joints. 
Differences in the rates of thermal expansion between the sealing 
material and the surrounding materials may lead to a temperature 
induced degradation of the seal. Conventional glass solders tend to 
require the use of too high a temperature, while those capable of use at 
lower temperatures often have large coefficients
