<ABSTRACT>
A lancet assembly having a blade designed for reduced pain that is used for piercing a
patient's skin to cause capillary blood to flow for collection and testing. The blade has a shear

percentage greater than conventional lancet blades to provide additional cutting action when
the blade is being inserted into a puncture wound and a blade width smaller than conventional

lancet blades. Reduced width and increased shear percentage result in reduced skin tear and
penetration force, which therefore causes less pain to the patient during skin penetration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blade for a lancet and, more particularly, 
relates to a lancet blade designed for reducing the amount of pain inflicted when being 
used to draw blood from a patient for diagnostic testing. A lancet is a device commonly used in hospitals, doctors offices and homes to 
pierce a patient's flesh to draw capillary blood for diagnostic testing. Conventional 
lancets consist of a shank portion having at a distal end a blade or spike, which is sharp 
and adapted to pierce the patient's skin so to sever capillaries and provide blood for 
testing. Since the blade or spike is sharp, some lancets are provided with a removable 
shield for protectively covering the sharp edge or point of the lancet's blade or spike  
 
when not in use to protect the patient and users from inadvertent skin puncture. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional lancet assembly 10 described in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,577,630 (Nitzsche et al), which is assigned to Becton, Dickinson 
and Company. Lancet assembly 10 includes a handle portion 11, a spike 12 extending 
outwardly from a distal end 13 and a removable shield 14 adapted to mate with spike 
12 when the lancet is not in use and protect users from accidental puncture. Spike 12 
in lancet assembly 10 can also be replaced with a conventional lancet blade, like that 
shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, conventional lancet blade 20 has an included angle ϑ of 
60°, a blade width A of 1.1mm, a blade length B of 1.85mm and a shear length C of 
0.635mm. In addition, blade 20 has a shear percentage of 34%, wherein: 
SHEAR PERCENTAGE = SHEAR LENGTH CBLADE LENGTH BAn example of a conventional lancet assembly for holding blade 20, is described in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,616,649 (Burns), assigned to Becton, Dickinson and Company, 
which is similar to the 6356 Lancet sold by Becton, Dickinson and Company. A problem with the lancets described above is that during penetration the blade 
or spike initially cuts but then tears sensitive nerve endings where the puncture wound 
is made in a finger, which causes a significant amount of pain to the patient. When 
using blade 20 shown in Fig. 2, the skin is cut by a shearing action over the shear 
length C of the blade. However, after the shearing portion of the blade has been fully 
inserted into the puncture wound, the blade continues to enter the skin without any 
cutting action being performed by the blade. Since the thickness of blade 20 continues  
 
to increase beyond the sheared portion, additional blade thickness is
