<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic bearing (A) comprises an outer ceramic ring (1) 
having a concave sliding face (1d), and an inner ceramic 

ring (2) having a convex sliding face (2a) of a shape 
complementary to the sliding face (1d) of the outer ring 

(1). The rings (1,2) are apertured (4,5) concentrically to 
receive a shaft (B). A method for the manufacture of the 

bearing is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramics-made bear­
ing and a manufacturing method thereof, which bearing being 
constructed by combining a ceramic inner ring and a ceramic 
outer ring. Nowadays, various bearings, such as slide bearings or 
roller bearings have been used or employed widely when rotary 
shafts are installed in machine frames. It is apparent that the roller bearings have respective­
ly an outer ring to be fitted into a housing formed in the 
machine frame, an inner ring through which a rotary shaft ex­
tending, and roller members, such as balls, rollers, and needles 
situated and arranged between the outer ring and the inner ring. 
According to the kind of the roller members, they are called a 
ball bearing, a roller bearing, a needle bearing. According to 
the manner of receiving load, they are called a radial bearing, 
a thrust bearing, and etc. (see Japan Patent Publication Sho. 
49-41231). Of these kinds of bearings, the particular bearings 
such as a deep-groove type ball bearing, an angular type ball 
bearing, and a taper roller bearing, and etc are used as the 
bearing enabling to support the shaft to which a radial load and 
a thrust load are simultaneously applied.  Some roller bearings are made or constructed of a metal 
supporter made of steel, cast iron, copper and the like and a 
white metal layer laminated on the metal supporter, which 
metal layer is machined to the predetermined size using a ma­
chine tool, and other roller bearings are made of another 
metal supporter made of copper, bronze metal, and the like and 
an oil-contained alloy metal layer laminated on the metal 
supporter or buried in the metal supporter. The roller bearing provided with a sleeve-like metal 
supporter has been used as a bearing for supporting a radial 
load (see Japan Patent Publication Sho. 49-18885). In addition, 
the roller bearing having a metal supporter shaped in a disc 
is used that one for supporting a thrust load (see Japan Patent 
Publication Sho. 49-678). Many roller bearings and roller bearings mentioned above 
are standardized and widely sold on market and the various 
bearings mentioned above respectively have particular character­
istics. On designing a machine, these bearings are selected and 
employed after considering the characteristics of them. The conventional roller bearings and slide bearings have 
their shortcomings. Flaking phenomenon due to rolling fatigue is happened on 
the roller bearings after a long period of usage necessarily 
shrtens their lives and lowers

<CLAIMS>
(1) A ceramic-made bearing comprising a ceramic-made outer 
ring having a curve-shape sliding face formed on the inner 

circumference of the outer ring and a ceramic-made inner ring 
provided with on its outer circumference a sliding face made 

from a curved face corresponding to the sliding face formed on 
the inner circumference of said ceramic-made outer ring and a 

shaft hole through which a shaft, wherein said shaft hole being 
coincide with the axis of the sliding face. 
(2) A ceramic-made bearing comprising a ceramic-made outer 
ring having a curve-shape sliding face formed on the inner 

circumference of the outer ring and a ceramic-made inner ring 
provided with on its outer circumference a sliding face made 

from a curved face corresponding to the sliding face formed on 
the inner circumference of said ceramic-made outer ring and a 

shaft hole through which a shaft, wherein said ceramic-made 
inner ring being contained in said ceramic-made outer ring. 
(3) The ceramic-made bearing according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the ceramic-made outer ring has a hole through which 

lubricant is supplied to the sliding faces. 
(4) The ceramic-made bearing according to one of claims 1 - 3, 
wherein the shape of the sliding face of the ceramic-made outer 

ring is a concave curved face or a concave cone-shape face, and 
the shape of the sliding face of the ceramic-made inner ring is 

a convex curved face or a convex cone-shape face. 
(5) A manufacturing method of a ceramic-made bearing, wherein 
a ceramic-made outer ring divided into a plural of members con­

tains a ceramic-made inner ring, the plural ceramic-made outer 
ring members are fixed to each other, an abrasive is injected 

into a gap between the sliding face formed on the ceramic-made 
outer ring and other sliding face formed on the ceramic-made 

inner ring, and said ceramic-made outer ring and said ceramic-­
made inner ring are mutually rotated and abraded.
