<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a variable-gain amplifier consisting of n elementary amplifiers in parallel and comprising means (SnA, SnB) making it possible to select the elementary amplifier of rank j (j = 1, 2, ..., n) according to the desired gain, characterised in that each elementary amplifier is of the common-base type and comprises means (Dn, Rn, In) making it possible to obtain a low value of input impedance which is independent of the gain of the selected amplifier.   The invention applies more particularly to the input stages of an amplification chain for receiving circuits requiring good performance in terms of noise.
