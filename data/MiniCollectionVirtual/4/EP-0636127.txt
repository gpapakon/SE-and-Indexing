<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to novel
compounds which have retinoic acid-like biological
activity. More specifically, the present invention
relates to compounds having an ethynyl-heteroaromatic
or an ethynyl-phenyl portion and a second portion which
is an alkyl-substituted thiochromanyl, chromanyl or
tetrahydroquinolinyl group. The present invention also
relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these
compounds and to methods of using the compounds and
compositions.US-A- 4,326,055 discloses
ethene derivatives which have a substituted phenyl ring
and a substituted indane or tetrahydronaphtalene group.
The compounds are described as tumor inhibiting agents,
and useful for treating dermatological conditions and
rheumatic illnesses. EP-A-0 419132 discloses ethyne derivatives having a substituted chroman, thiochroman or tetrahydroquinoline group an an aromatic acid-containing moiety such as benzoic acid or nicotinic acid. The compounds have retinoid activity.US-A- 4,723,028 discloses 1,2-diphenylethene
(stilbene) derivatives which have 
retinoic acid-like activity.US-A- 4,740,519 discloses
certain aromatic heterocycle derivatives which have
retinoic acid like activity.EP-A- 130795
discloses ethene derivatives, where the ethene moiety
is substituted by a substituted phenyl group and by a
substitituted chroman, thiochroman or quinoline group.
The compounds are useful for inhibiting the degradation
of cartilage in mammals.EP-A- 176034 (published
April 2, 1986) discloses tetrahydronaphtalene compounds
having an ethynylbenzoic group.
US-A- 4,739,098 discloses compounds wherein three
olefinic units from the acid-containing moiety of
retinoic acid are replaced by an ethynylphenyl
functionality. These compounds have retinoic acid-like
biological activity.US-A- 4,810,804 (issued on
March 7, 1989) based on an application of the same
inventor and assigned to the same assignee as the
present application, discloses such disubstituted
acetylene compounds wherein one of the substituents of
the acetylene (ethyne) group is a substituted phenyl
group, and the second substituent is a 4,4-dimethyl
substituted 6-chromanyl, 6-thiochromanyl or 6-tetrahydroquinolinyl
group. The compounds disclosed
and claimed in US-A- 4,810,804 have
retinoic acid-like biological activity.A published European patent application of the
present applicant (EP-A-0284288, published
on September 28, 1988) describes compounds having
retinoic acid like activity which are 4,4 dimethyl 
substituted chroman-6-yl, and 4,4 dimethyl-substituted
thioch
