<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an agent for the treatment of hair, in particular an agent for the treatment of hair before winding onto permanent wave curlers (permanent wave pretreatment agent), which has an aqueous or aqueous-alcoholic basis and which contains   (A) 0.1 to 10 per cent by weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer (B) 0.1 to 9 per cent by weight of at least one amphoteric surfactant, (C) 0.1 to 5 per cent by weight of at least one cationic surfactant and   (D) 0.1 to 2.0 per cent by weight of at least one organic acid and to methods for using the agent.

<CLAIMS>
Agent for the treatment of hair, on an aqueous or
aqueous-alcoholic basis, characterised in that it contains


(A) 0.1 to 10
percent by weight polyvinylpyrrolidone and/or
polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer,
(B) 0.1 to 9
percent by weight of at least one amphoteric
surfactant,
(C) 0.1 to 5
percent by weight of at least one cationic
surfactant and
(D) 0.1 to 2.0
percent by weight of at least one organic
acid,

and is a non-disperse solution and is not rinsed out.
Agent according to claim 1, characterised in that it
contains from 0.1 to 4 percent by weight of component (A).
Agent according to either claim 1 or claim 2, characterised
in that it contains as component (B) a fatty acid

amidoalkyl betaine and/or a fatty acid amidoalkyl
sulphobetaine.
Agent according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that it contains from 0.1 to 4 percent by weight of

component (B). 
Agent according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that it contains from 0.1 to 2 percent by weight of

component (C).
Agent according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that it contains as component (C) cetyltrimethylammonium

chloride.
Agent according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that it contains from 0.1 to 1 percent by weight of

component (D).
Agent according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the organic acid of component (D) is selected

from tartaric acid, glyoxylic acid, lactic acid and formic
acid.
Agent according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that it contains from 0.01 to 1 percent by weight of

a keratin hydrolysate.
Process for the permanent shaping of hair, in which the
hair, before being wound onto permanent waving curlers, is

treated with a permanent waving pretreatment agent, the hair
is dried, dampened with water again, wound onto curlers,

then treated with a permanent hair shaping agent, rinsed
with water after a period of action sufficient for the

permanent shaping of the hair, then subjected to an oxidative
after-treatment, rinsed with water, then arranged in a

style and subsequently dried, characterised in that an agent 
according to any one of claims 1 to 9 is used as the permanent

waving pretreatment agent.
Process according to claim 10, characterised in that
the permanent waving pretreatment agent is applied in an

amount of from 10 to 20 g.
Process for the treatment of hair, characterised in
that, when the hair has been washed, the agent according to

any one of claims 1 to 9 is distributed in the towel-dried
hair in an amount of from 10 to 20 g and then the hair is

dried.
