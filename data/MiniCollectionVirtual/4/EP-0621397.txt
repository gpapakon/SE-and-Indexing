<ABSTRACT>
Gas influx into a wellbore, which is commonly referred to 
as a "kick", is detected during active drilling of the borehole. 

One embodiment of the present invention is based upon the existence 
of standing wave patterns generated by pressure oscillations of the 

drilling rig mud pumps. The standing wave patterns form time 
sequences of maxima and minima as a gas influx or "slug" moves 

upwardly in the annulus. Time spacing between these peaks is equal 
to the time needed for gas cut mud to be displaced over a distance 

equal to a one-half wavelength of a standing wave at a frequency of 
the mud pump. The time between such peaks is measured and forms 

the basis for generating a first kick signal. A continuous 
increase in the phase between annulus and drill string standing 

waves forms the basis for another standing wave kick signal. 
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is based upon 

the fact that the gas cut mud in the annulus affects acoustic 
transmission time differently than mud in the interior of the drill 

string. Accordingly, acoustic signals from a downhole source near 
the bottom of the borehole are transmitted at different speeds in 

the annulus mud and in the interior drill string mud. This 
downhole source may either be an MWD signal transmitter or drilling 

noise generated at the bit and resulting from the interaction 
between the bit and the rock. The annulus and drill string mud 

signals are detected at the surface and shifted in time and 
correlated with each other to remove phase ambiguity. A difference  

 
in arrival time between the signals is determined, and if large 

enough, causes a second kick signal to be generated. Another 
embodiment of the present invention may be used where at least two 

drilling pumps are used in the drilling system. This method 
determines the total travel time, from standpipe to drill string 

and up the annulus, of a beat frequency pressure wave caused by 
slightly different frequencies of the two pumps. A third alarm 

signal is generated if the total travel time is greater than a 

predetermined threshold. In a particularly preferred embodiment of 
the invention, both the first and second kick signals (and where 

possible, the third kick signal) are required to exist to establish 
a final kick alarm signal in order to substantially eliminate false 

signals. Another preferred embodiment determines mud pump noise 
round trip transit time T by evaluating a function 


T=(n-Φ/2π)f 
 
where Φ is the phase between standpipe and annulus signals and f is 

the frequency of a drill fluid oscillation caused by a mud pump and 
n is an integer which is incremented or decremented until the rate 

of change of T with respect to frequency is zero. An alarm signal 
is generated when the rate of change of T with respect to time 

exceeds a predetermined threshold. Another embodiment determines 
the Doppler frequency shift of a mud pump signal expressed as a 

ratio signal, Delta f/f, where Delta f is the change in frequency 
measured at the annulus from the frequency f of the mud pump signal 

measured at the standpipe. The ratio is compared with a threshold 
signal to determine whether or not gas influx has entered the 

annulus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the detection
of a fluid influx, particularly a gas influx or "kick",
into the borehole of an oil or gas well. More
particularly, the present invention relates to methods
of and apparatus for the acoustic detection of a gas
influx during the drilling of the borehole.Normally, hydrostatic pressure of the drilling
fluid column in a well is greater than pressure of
formation fluids, thus preventing flow of formation
fluids into the wellbore. When the hydrostatic
pressure drops below the formation-fluid pressure, the
formation fluids can enter the well. If this flow is
relatively small and causes a decrease in the density
of the mud as measured at the surface, the drilling
fluid is said to be "gas cut", "salt-water cut", or
"oil cut" as the case may be. When a noticeable
increase in mud-pit volume occurs, the typical prior
art method of gas influx detection, the event is known
as a "kick". An uncontrolled flow of formation fluids
into the wellbore and up to the surface is a "blowout". As long as hydrostatic pressure controls the well,
circulation is accomplished by using a flowline, or the well may be
left open while the bit is removed. If a kick occurs, blowout-prevention
equipment and accessories are needed to close the well.
This may be done with an annular preventer, with pipe rams, or with
master (blind) rams when the drill pipe is out of the hole.In addition, means are necessary to pump drilling fluid
into the well and to allow controlled escape of fluids. Injection
is accomplished either down the drill pipe or through one of the
kill lines, and flow from the well is controlled by a variable
orifice or choke attached to a choke line. Choke lines are
arranged so that well effluent can be routed to either a reserve
pit where undesired fluid is discarded, or to a mud/gas separator,
degasser, and mud pit where desired fluid is degassed and saved.
By using this equipment, the low-density fluids are removed and
replaced with a higher-density fluid capable of controlling the
well.As mentioned above, kick detection while drilling in the
past has typically been indicated by observing and monitoring the
mud return flow rate and/or mud pit volume. Accordingly, most rigs
which use drilling mud to control the pressure in the borehole have
some form of pit-level indicating device to indicate a gain or loss
of mud. A mud pit-level indicating and recording device such as a
chart is usually located in a position so that the driller can see 
the chart while drilling is occurring. When a
