<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the recycling of denaturing or 
solubilizing agents known as chaotropes which are used to solubilize inclusion 
bodies or insoluble proteins obtained from bacteria using recombinant DNA 
biotechnology. Purification schemes for proteins produced by recombinant technology 
usually involve isolation of insoluble heterologous proteins, also known as inclusion 
bodies, followed by denaturation and solvation and subsequent renaturation to 
obtain the biologically active protein. Denaturation is often accomplished by 
treatment with concentrated solutions of solubilizing agents known as chaotropes; 
renaturation into the biologically active form of the protein occurs spontaneously 
when the chaotrope is removed or diluted. U.S. Patent No. 5,082,775 describes a process for chymosin production 
which includes the steps of solubilization of inclusion bodies with 8M urea, dilution 
with an alkaline pH buffer and subsequent neutralization which results in rapid 
renaturation. International Patent No. WO 83/04418 describes a process for producing 
chymosin in which the insoluble form of the chymosin precursor is reversibly 
denatured with 7M urea or 6M guanidine hydrochloride. The urea or guanidine 
hydrochloride is then removed by dialysis after which the protein returns to a 
conformation capable of being converted to active chymosin. Both of the above procedures when adapted to a commercial processes 
produce a dilute urea waste solution which results in a difficult and expensive 
disposal problem. U.S. Patent No. 5,202,239 discusses solubilization of inclusion bodies 
containing atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) with 6M urea. The purified fusion protein 
was shown to contain proteolytic enzymes from E.coli. These were cleared by 
contact with immobilized staph V8. ANP was separated from the high molecular 
weight cleavage products by ultrafiltration over an Amicon YM10 membrane with a 
10,000 molecular weight cut off. In addition to ANP, the filtrate stream contained the 
N-terminal peptide and urea from the cleavage reaction. ANP was separated by  
 
cation exchange chromatography or gel filtration chromatography. This reference 
also describes a number of other peptide substances which are formed as fusion 
proteins and must undergo a solubilization step during processing. These include 
urogastrone, proinsulin, and epidermal growth factor. This invention provides an improved process for the preparation of chymosin or 
prochymosin in which

<CLAIMS>
An improved process for the preparation of chymosin or prochymosin in which 
an insoluble form of said chymosin or prochymosin is produced by E. Coli having a 

gene coding for said chymosin or prochymosin wherein said insoluble form is 
solubilized by reversibly denaturing said insoluble form with urea to produce a 

soluble form of said chymosin or prochymosin, and removing said urea and allowing 
said solubilized form to renature thereby producing the soluble native form of said 

chymosin or prochymosin, wherein the improvement comprises: 

a) removing at least 50% of said urea from said solubilized denatured form of 
said chymosin or prochymosin by passing said urea through an ultrafiltration 

membrane; and 
b) adding said urea removed in step a) to supply an effective denaturing 
amount of urea to an additional quantity of said insoluble form of an additional 

quantity of said chymosin or prochymosin to produce said soluble form of said 

chymosin or prochymosin; and periodically cleaning said membrane by: 
c) flushing the system at a high flow rate of at least three holdup volumes of 
pH 10.3 - 10.5 dilution buffer; 
d) flushing at a high flow rate with at least 3 holdup volumes of 50°-54°C 
deionized water; 
e) repeating step d) maintaining the pH at 9.5-11.0; 
f) adding sodium hypochlorite solution to a free chlorine level of 180-200 
ppm; 
g) recirculating said hypochlorite solution for 20 to 60 minutes; and 
h) flushing with deionized water until said chlorine level is less than 0.15ppm.
