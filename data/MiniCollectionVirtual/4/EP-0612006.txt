<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a method and a system for creating annotations 
(notes) from text entered by a user. The notes are permanently and 

persistently associated with a title text in a window and are either 
displayed or hidden along with the window having the associated title 

text. The title of the window, the note position and the note text are 
stored 116 in nonvolatile storage as a note record, preferably along with 

all other note records to form a note dictionary 16. Thereafter, when 
each new window having a title is displayed, the system compares 202 the 

new window title with each note title previously recorded. If the new 
title is the same as any note titles, then the note text is displayed 212 

at the note position. When a window is closed 218 or altered 228, 240 in 
a way that would affect the way that the notes should be displayed, the 

system searches the note records to find all notes being displayed on the 

particular window and processes them accordingly. For example, if the 
window is being closed, then all associated notes are hidden.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and system of allowing
users to annotate software windows.It is common for personal computers and workstations to provide a
graphical user-computer interface environment made up of a simulated
desktop, windows and icons. The user is provided with a keyboard and a
cursor movement device such as a mouse or track ball to manipulate data
on the display screen. The simulated desktop establishes the desktop
metaphor for the user interface. The simulated desktop is the screen or
surface on which the user performs work. This "desktop" is the
background on which objects (icons and windows) are placed.Icons: Icons are small pictures which represent available objects. They
can reside directly on the desktop or in windows on the desktop. An icon
may represent a document a user is writing, a program, or a directory,
etc. The contents of the object represented by the icon can be viewed
through a window. The icon can be opened into a window.Window: A window is a frame for viewing some object. Windows are
normally standardized to provide a common framework for the variety of
information with which users work. Standard components of a window are
the window title bar and border. The title bar shows the title of the
particular window. The title typically identifies the information
(object) that is currently displayed in the window.The user can manipulate the windows by moving them around on the
desktop (screen), and sizing them. The user can also open and close
windows as they perform their work. The content of each window is
generally not under the control of the user, but rather is controlled by
the program creating the window. It is helpful to a user to be able to
write notes on windows on the desktop just as one could write notes on a
piece of paper on a real desktop. Special purpose word processing systems for attaching annotations
(text and audio) to documents are known. For example, CLARKE, et al.
(U.S. pat. no. 4,424,575) describe a word processing system which allows
text to be displayed with added comments separately recorded.B.A. Barker, et al. (Method for Interactively Entering Comment
Data Into Documents, IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, 02-85 p.5119)
describe an interactive text processing system which allows a user to
selectively enter comment data which is normally hidden from view at a
desired point in a text file. When the user selects the comment option
from the menu displayed by the text processing system, the system inserts
a window with blank lines at the

<CLAIMS>
A method of annotating objects in display screen windows for use in
a computer system having means for displaying multiple windows, the

method comprising the steps of:

entering (100) a new note mode upon detecting a selected action by
a user;
detecting (104) the pressing of the execute key when the pointer is
located in a portion of a window having an associated title;
recording (108) the title of the window as a note title;
recording the pointer position relative to the window as a note
position;
displaying text entered by the user as a note text at the note
position;
storing (116) the note title, note position and note text in
nonvolatile storage (19) as a note record;
exiting the new note mode; and
for each new window displayed having a title, comparing (310) the
new window title with the note title and if the new title and the note

title are equivalent, then displaying (312) the note text at the note
position.
A method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising the step of
comparing (202), for each window being closed, the window title with the

note title in each note record in the note dictionary and if the title of
the window being closed and the note title are equivalent, then removing

(222) the note text from the display.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the step of
entering (100) a new note mode further comprises detecting the pressing

of the execute key by the user when the pointer is positioned on a
designated portion of a window associated with a note generating program.
A method as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the step
of entering (100) a new note mode further comprises detecting the

pressing of a designated key stroke sequence by the user.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the step of
entering (100) a new note mode further comprises altering a default

pointer display in a selected manner to visually indicate new note mode 
and the step of exiting the new note mode further comprises restoring the

default pointer display.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the multiple
windows are displayed on a simulated desktop; and the step of displaying

text further comprises using selected visual display characteristics to
display the note text to distinguish the note text from other text in the

window or on the desktop.
A system for generating annotations for objects in display screen
windows for use in a computer system having means for displaying multiple

windows, the annotation system comprising:

means for entering (100) a new note mode upon detecting a selected
action by a user;
means for detecting (104) the pressing of the execute key when the
pointer is located in a portion of a window having an associated title;
means for recording (108) the title of the window as a note title;
means for recording the pointer position relative to the window as
a note position;
means for displaying text entered by the user as a note text at the
note position;
means for storing (116) the note title, note position and note text
in nonvolatile storage (19) as a note record;
means for exiting the new note mode;
means for comparing (310) a new window title with the note title
for each new window displayed having a title; and
means for displaying (312) the note text at the note position
responsive to the means for comparing.
