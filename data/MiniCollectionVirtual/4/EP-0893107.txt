<ABSTRACT>
A cylindrical stent (10) for placement in a vessel of
a human body. The stent has a longitudinal axis and in its

formation includes circumferential arcs (12) and diagonal
struts (14) having an intersection angle between the

circumferential arcs (12) and the diagonal struts (14)
within the range of 10 to 80 degrees when the stent (10) is

in its non-deployed state. The diagonal struts (14) are
joined by curved sections (18) to the circumferential arcs

(12) which collectively form a closed perimeter cell. The
closed perimeter cell has two parallel, circumferential

arcs (12) located at the longitudinal extremeties of the
closed perimeter cell and the circumferential arcs (12) lie

generally perpendicular to the stent's longitudinal axis
where the stent (10) may be deployed in a manner so that

although the length of the stent (10) increases during
deployment, at the nominal fully deployed diameter, the

deployed stent (10) is substantially the same length as the
non-deployed length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is an expandable stent insertable into a vessel of a human body
for the purpose of creating and maintaining the patency of that vessel.In U.S. Patent No. 4,739,762, J.C. Palmaz describes a balloon expandable stent that
is at its greatest length in its non-deployed state and becomes progressively shorter as it
is expanded to progressively greater diameters. This stent shortening can result in
incomplete coverage of a dilated stenosis. Furthermore, the Palmaz stent is quite
radially elastic which has been shown to cause at least 10% radial recoil after balloon
expansion in an artery due to the acute elastic recoil of the artery.The present invention is designed to overcome several disadvantages of prior art
balloon expandable stents. Specifically, the Butterfly Expandable To Honeycomb
(BETH) stent described herein consists of a collection of circumferential (or vertical)
arc structures and diagonal struts. These arcs and struts form a butterfly shape before
the stent is expanded and a hexagonal, honeycomb type of structure is created when the
stent is fully expanded. Until the nominal stent diameter is reached, the deployed 
length of the stent is actually longer than the non-deployed length. At the nominal
fully deployed diameter, the deployed stent is exactly the same length as the non-deployed
length. This characteristic provides better assurance of completely covering a
dilated stenosis as compared to a stent that shortens in length when deployed as is
typical of all prior art balloon expandable stents. Furthermore, because at least one
quarter of the expanded stent's circumference consists of vertical arcs that are arcs of a
circle, they provide the BETH stent with improved radial rigidity.An embodiment of this invention seeks to provide a balloon expandable stent that
increases in its length as it is expanded radially outward.An embodiment of this invention seeks to provide a balloon expandable stent with
improved radial rigidity.A better understanding of this invention will become apparent from the following
illustrative description and the associated drawings in which:
FIG. 1 illustrates the non-deployed BETH stent as it would appear if it were rolled out
flat to form a 2-dimensional structure; FIG. 2 is an enlarged view of a limited portion of the flat, 2-dimensional
non-deployed
structure;FIG. 3 illustrates the BETH stent as it would appear after deployment if it were rolled
out flat to form a 2-dimensional structure; andFIG. 4 is a graph that compares the longitudinal
