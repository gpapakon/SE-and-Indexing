<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a carrier for surface 
plasmon resonance analysis (SPR) in which a metallic 

film comprising a layer of silver is deposited on a 
surface characterised in that before the film is 

deposited the surface is subjected to a pre-treatment 
comprising a step in which it is treated with an 

oxygen-containing gas to cause oxygen ions to enter 
the surface to an extent sufficient to sensitive it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of carriers for surface plasmon resonance
(SPR).Surface plasmon resonance or (SPR) is a technique
which can be used in the analysis of antibodies which
are deposited on surfaces which have been coated with
thin films of metal, in particular thin films of
silver. SPR based sensors are discussed in a paper by
I Faulkner, W R Flavell, J Davies, R F Sunderland and
C S Nunnerly : "SPR-based sensors studied by electron
energy loss spectroscopy and attenuated total
reflection" - to be published in J Electron
Spectroscopy, 1993. The manner in which a coating is
applied to a surface has important consequences for
the subsequent properties of that surface in terms of
SPR and control of the coating process is important.
At present coating is generally performed by
spattering but control is not good. It is important
that the films are formed from uniform layers of metal
in order to get reproducible SPR. On account of this
improved method for the production of films for SPR
are desirable.In a known process a film of silver is deposited
on a surface which has been subjected to a pre-treatment
comprising a number of steps including a
step in which a preparatory metallic layer comprising
titanium or chromium is deposited on a surface to form
a base for the silver layer.According to the present invention we provide a
process for the production of a carrier for SPR
analysis as defined in the accompanying claims. 
Suitably a glass surface is subjected to an
appropriate pre-treatment before the metallic film is
deposited upon it. A suitable pre-treatment comprises
the steps of cleaning, followed by treatment with an
oxygen-containing gas by the process of the invention.
Thereafter a metallic film may be deposited in two
steps, a deposit of a lower preparatory layer followed
by a deposit of an upper silver layer. After the
silver layer has been deposited the film is preferably
annealed effectively in order to bake it and thereby
orient it and enhance its physical properties.Preferably the surface is a glass surface. Any
suitable glass surface may be used but a preferred
surface has a silicon dioxide surface layer.
Particularly suitable types of glass are "PERMABLOC"(TM)
and the earlier product "PERMASHEET"(TM) glass, both
manufactured by Pilkington Glass of St. Helens,
England. These have consistent top layers of silicon
dioxide.In the pre-treatment the glass can be cleaned by
treating with a freon and/or by ultrasonic treatment
and thereafter with a vapour bath or blow
