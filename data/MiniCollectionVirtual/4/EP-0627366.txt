<ABSTRACT>
Pack of sheets, in particular for packaging. Pack of sheets including a gripping means permitting automated manufacture of standardised packs. The pack comprises a set of sheets cut beforehand to the desired format, these being joined together along a first transverse edge (3) and each being provided, in a second transverse edge (4) opposite the first transverse edge, with a gripping means constituted by a fold (5a), the total thickness of the fold of each of the sheets being reduced, in an area (5) adjacent to the second transverse edge, of width at least equal to the width of the fold, having a value of between 20 and 40% compared to the initial thickness of the fold. Application to packs of packaging sheets for food products.

Pack of sheets in which the various sheets previously 
cut to the desired format are connected to one another along 

a first transversal edge (3) and each sheet is provided with 
a gripping means at a second transversal edge (4) positioned 

opposite the said first transversal edge (3), said gripping 
means consisting of a fold (5a), characterised in that the 

thickness of each sheet is reduced in a zone (5) which is adjacent 
to the said second transversal edge at a width which 

is at least equal to the width of the said fold, by a value 
between 20% and 40% of the initial thickness of the sheet. 
Pack as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
thickness of each of the said sheets is reduced in said zone 

by 30% of the initial thickness of the sheet. 
Pack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
said zone (5) has a width which is equal to that of the said 

fold (5a). 
Pack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
said zone (5) has double the width of that of the said fold 

(5a).  
 
Pack as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the said gripping means is a fold (5a) which 

is formed across the total length of the said second transversal 
edge (4). 
Pack as claimed in anyone of the above claims, characterised 
in that each one of the sheets further is provided in 

the vicinity of the first transversal edge (3) with an embossment 
extending parallel with respect to same, so that the 

thickness of the sheet at the embossment is equal to the 
overall thickness of the sheet at the level of the fold (5a). 
Pack as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the 
said embossment has a width of between 2 and 3 cm.
