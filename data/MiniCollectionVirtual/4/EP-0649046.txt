<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display device, comprising a display medium
including liquid crystal regions surrounded by a polymeric
wall and sandwiched between a pair of opposing
substrates, applicable to a plane display device such
as a personal computer, a liquid crystal television
set, a portable display including a film substrate, and
a display apparatus in which a display portion and an
input portion are integrated for adopting a pen entry
operation.Conventional liquid crystal display devices
utilize a variety of display modes as follows: As
liquid crystal display devices utilizing an electro-optic
effect, a twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal
display device and a super-twisted nematic (STN) liquid
crystal display device using nematic liquid crystal
have been put to practical use (Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No. 59-119320). Further, as an STN
liquid crystal display device achieving a brighter
display, a reflective type liquid crystal display
device including one polarizing plate is proposed
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 4-97121 and
4-289818).As liquid crystal display devices utilizing
light scattering of liquid crystal without using a
polarizing plate, those utilizing a dynamic scattering
(DS) effect and a phase change (PC) effect have been 
proposed.Recently, as a liquid crystal display device
requiring neither a polarizing plate nor an alignment
treatment, a display device utilizing the birefringence
of liquid crystal so as to electrically control the
transparent state and the opaque state has been
proposed. In such a liquid crystal display device, the
refractive index of the liquid crystal molecule with
respect to ordinary light is basically matched with the
refractive index of a polymeric material supporting the
liquid crystal. As a result, the transparent state is
displayed when a voltage is applied to uniformly orient
the liquid crystal molecules, and the opaque state is
displayed under application of no voltage because of
light scattering caused by the turbulence of the liquid
crystal molecules. It is disclosed that such a liquid
crystal display device is produced by using a mixture
of a photosensitive or thermosetting material and
liquid crystal, from which the photosensitive or
thermosetting material alone is deposited by
polymerization, thereby forming a liquid crystal droplet
surrounded by the polymeric material (resin)
(Japanese National Publication No. 61-502128).As another type of a liquid crystal display
device, a non-scattering type
