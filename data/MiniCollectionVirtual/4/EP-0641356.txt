<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain substituted 17β-substituted -6-azaandrost-4-en-3-ones
and their use as 5α-testosterone reductase inhibitors.Androgens are responsible for many physiological functions in both males and
females. Androgen action is mediated by specific intracellular hormone receptors
expressed in androgen responsive cells. Testosterone, the major circulating
androgen, is secreted by Leydig cells of the testes under the stimulation of pituitary-derived
luteinizing hormone (LH). However, reduction of the 4, 5 double bond of
testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is required in some target tissues, such
as prostate and skin, for androgen action. Steroid 5α-reductase in target tissues
catalyzes conversion of testosterone to DHT in an NADPH dependent fashion as
shown in Scheme A.
The requirement for DHT to act as an agonist in these target tissues has been
highlighted by studies of steroid 5α-reductase deficient individuals who have
vestigial prostate glands and do not suffer from acne vulgaris or male pattern
baldness (see McGinley, J., et al., J. Steroid Biochem., 11, 637-648, (1979)). Thus, 
inhibition of the conversion of testosterone to DHT in these target tissues is
anticipated to be useful in the treatment of a variety of androgen responsive
diseases, e.g., benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostate cancer, acne, male pattern
baldness and hirsutism.Because of their valuable therapeutic potential, testosterone 5α-reductase inhibitors
[hereinafter "5α-reductase inhibitors"] have been the subject of active research
worldwide. For example, see: Hsia, S. and Voight, W., J. Invest. Derm., 62, 224
(1973); Robaire, B., et al., J. Steroid Biochem., 8, 307 (1977); Petrow, V., et al.,
Steroids, 38, 121 (1981); Liang, T., et al., J. Steroid Biochem.,19, 395 (1983); Holt,
D., J. Med. Chem., 33, 937 (1990); U.S. Patent No. 4,377,584 and U.S. Patent No.
5,017,568. Two particularly promising 5α-reductase inhibitors currently in clinical
trials are MK-906 (Merck) and SKF-105657 (SmithKline Beecham), shown in
Scheme B.

wherein
R1 and R2 are,
i) independently hydrogen or lower alkyl and the bond between the carbons
bearing R1 and R2 is a single or a double bond, orii) taken together are a -CH2- group to form a cyclopropane ring, and the
bond between the carbons bearing R1 and R2 is a single bond;R3 is hydrogen, -Alk1-H optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms,
lower cycloalkyl, lower cycloalkyl-lower alkyl, halogen,
