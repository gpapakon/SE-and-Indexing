<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for purification 
of fluids, preferably rinsing fluids in 

connection with the development of photographic 
films. The method is characterized 

by purifying the rinsing fluid of any solid 
matter particles such as silver residue, gelatine and 

preventing the growth of algae and bacteria 
in the rinsing fluid. 
For this purpose the fluid is successively pumped through a filter 
unit comprising at least one mechanical rough filter (3) at least one 

fine filter (5,6) and a filter with ultra-violet light (8), which is 
arranged between a first reception tank (1) and a second reception tank. 

The fluid is circulated between said two tanks and a part of the 
circulating fluid is circulated to the rinsing apparatus from the second 

reception tank (2). Both reception tanks are provided with aluminium 
plates (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of purifying rinsing fluids used in graphic
production, in particular fluids from developing apparatuses polluted by particles of
solid matter such as silver residue from the films that have been developed and
biological particles such as algae and bacteria.Following ever stricter requirements by the authorities concerning the outlet of
waste water a need is created for the possibilities of purifying e.g. waste water or
other polluted fluid of several noxious substances and a need for purifying the
polluted fluid more thoroughly in order to reduce the amount of noxious
substances in the fluid being discharged to the receiver.In the graphic industries it is particularly the rinsing fluid which constitutes a
source of pollution when discharged to the receiver. The rinsing fluid is used in the
last phase of film development after the film has been taken through the developer
and the fixative. The polluting substances are primarily constituted by silver residue
from the films that have been developed, gelatine, and algae and bacteria. Besides,
the pH of the rinsing fluid is critical for the outlet e.g. into a sewer.In Denmark the requirements, e.g. of the environmental authorities of Copenhagen,
stipulate that the outlet of rinsing fluid into sewers in connection with film
development may as a maximum contain 0.5 mg of silver per litre of fluid, that the
maximum outlet is 120 m3 of waste water per day, and that this waste water must
have a pH in the interval 6.0 - 9.0. As it appears, not only requirements on the
contents of noxious substances in the waste water are made but also the amount of
waste being discharges is stipulated.Thus it is the object of the present invention to disclose a method and an apparatus
which are sufficiently capable of removing the noxious substances from the waste
water before it is discharged to the receiver, and which will at the same time ensure
that the fluid may be reused a certain number of times before final discharge so that
the maximum amount of fluid permitted for discharge is not exceeded. This object is achieved by a method which is characterized in that any such
particles in particular silver is precipitated from the fluid in a first reception tank
using horizontal plates, whereafter the fluid is successively pumped through a filter
unit comprising at least one first mechanical filter and at least one second filter,
said first filter being rougher than the second one, and a filter with ultraviolet light,
which is arranged
