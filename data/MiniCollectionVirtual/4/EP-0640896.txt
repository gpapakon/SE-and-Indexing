<ABSTRACT>
A multifunctional electronic watch of the present invention displays data 
measured by a built in atmospheric pressure sensor (56) by means of a small 

atmospheric pressure pointer (10) and an atmospheric pressure pointer (11). It is also 
capable of displaying a differential between the present atmospheric pressure and an 

atmospheric pressure three hours before by means of an atmospheric pressure tendency 
pointer (21). A dial ring (17) attached around a clockface of the watch is formed with 

an atmospheric pressure scale (18), on the outer periphery of which is a rotation bezel 
(19) formed with a height scale (20). The built in sensor is accommodated in the watch 

so as not to project from the rotation bezel of the watch. Accordingly, an electronic 
watch which has additional functions of indicating environmental data such as 

atmospheric pressure without complicating the constitution can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic watch, and more particularly to a
multifunctional electronic watch with a sensor and so on provided therein.A conventional multifunctional electronic watch with a sensor, as described in
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. SHO 61-154585 or Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. HEI 4-64085, has a raised portion on the outer periphery of a cover case of the
watch in which a sensor mechanism is accommodated so that a time display and the
sensor may not overlap with each other.In Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. HEI 4-43238, a multifunctional
electronic watch is disclosed which has an additional function of a barometer or an
altimeter by providing a pressure sensor in the electronic watch. This watch is
designed to display the weather.Further, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. SHO 60-260883, an electronic
watch which adopts an adjustable drive system using a variety of detection pulse is
disclosed in order to extend a battery life of the electronic watch.Conventional electronic watches, however, have several disadvantages shown
below which will impair the value of the added functions when new functions are
added.First, because conventional electronic watches do not have a pointer, it is not
easy to see the display. Further, since the cover case of the watch has a raised portion
with a built-in sensor, the watch does not fit with a user's wrist or looks poor.Second, in the case of a multifunctional electronic watch which can measure the
atmospheric pressure value, in order to obtain a relative height or an atmospheric
pressure which is corrected to sea level from the measurements, a number of
operational buttons need to be placed because an operation for correction is needed,
and the operation of the buttons is extremely complicated.Third, in an analog display electronic watch with a sensor or an analog-digital
display electronic watch, it is generally impossible to perform generation of drive-motor 
driving pulses and measurements by a sensor at the same timing because of the
limitations of electric source feed capacity, the timing to drive each of them are
staggered. Accordingly, when time is shown by a second, there is a limitation that the
total of an output period of a motor drive pulse to drive a motor for displaying the
present time and a period in which AID conversion is performed must not exceed 1
second. The double-integral type AID conversion circuit employed in a multifunctional
electronic watch with a sensor need to have long enough time for integration
