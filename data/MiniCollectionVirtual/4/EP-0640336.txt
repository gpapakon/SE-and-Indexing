<ABSTRACT>
A parenteral pharmaceutical preparation comprises 
a matrix containing a physiologically active peptide or 

protein and a polyglycerol diester of a saturated fatty 
acid, and the matrix is in a solid form at room temperature. 

The molecular weight of the physiologically 
active peptide or protein is 2,000 dalton or more. The 

saturated fatty acid includes fatty acids having about 
16 to 30 carbon atoms such as palmitic acid, stearic 

acid, etc. The matrix may be in a pillar or granular 
form. The parenteral pharmaceutical preparation can be 

used as an injectable solid administered subcutaneously 
or intramuscularly (for example, a pellet or tablet for 

implantation), a suppository or the like, and can 
release the physiologically active peptide or protein 

sustainedly for a prolonged period of one week or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sustained 
releasable parenteral preparation useful for sustained 
or prolonged release of a physiologically active peptide 
or protein, and a method of producing the same. For administration of a therapeutic agent, oral 
administration is generally employed. Oral administration 
of a physiologically active peptide or protein, 
however, causes hydrolysis of the peptide or protein by 
a digestive enzyme to decrease disadvantageously the 
absorbability from the digestive tract. Accordingly, 
such physiologically active peptide or protein is 
usually administered by repetition of intramuscular or 
subcutaneous injections or by intravenous drip infusion. 
These methods, however, are not preferable in a 
chronic administration, although they are acceptable in 
a case where the repetition of the injection is extremely 
limited. By way of illustrating, for the 
therapy of viral hepatitis type C, interferon-α is 
continuously administered daily throughout 4 weeks or 
more (see "Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine 
(IGAKU NO AYUMI)", 161, 5, 359-363 (1992)). In  
 
such chronic or frequent administration, however, the 
patient is obliged to be restrained to a great extent. 
Therefore, development of an effective and economic 
administration system for such physiologically active 
peptide or protein has been demanded. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 
2930/1988 (JP-A-63-2930) discloses a system where a 
polypeptide is dispersed in a polylactide. Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 502117/1988 (JP-B-63-502117) and 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 234820/1992 
(JP-A-4-234820) disclose pharmaceutical preparations 
using a liposome, and Japanese Patent Publication No. 
502574/1991 (JP-B-3-502574) proposes a pharmaceutical 
preparation where a liposome containing a physiologically 
active polypeptide is dispersed in a gel. When these pharmaceutical preparations are administered, 
however, the drugs are unexpectedly released 
to a large extent in the initial stage of administration. 
Thus the drug concentration in blood is increased 
and the releasing rate of the drug can not be 
maintained in a certain range. Furthermore, since an 
organic solvent is used in the manufacture of the 
preparation, the polypeptide is denaturated to decrease 
the physiological activity. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 
2930/1988 (JP-A-63-2930) discloses a sustained releasable 
system for a physiologically active polypeptide,  
 
which comprises an atherocollagen-matrix
