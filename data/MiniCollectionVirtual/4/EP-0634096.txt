<ABSTRACT>
An implement for milking animals, such as cows, 
comprises a milking parlour and a robot arm (7) able to carry 

teat cups (80) which can automatically be connected to the 
teats of an animal. The robot arm (7) has portions (61, 62) 

which are slidable relative to each other. Further a teat cup 
(80) is mounted, movable in upward direction, against one 

(62) of said portions; this portion forms a robot arm end 
portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement for 
milking animals, such as cows, comprising a milking parlour 
and a robot arm able to carry teat cups which can 
automatically be connected to the teats of an animal, the 
robot arm having portions which are slidable relative to each 
other. Such an implement is known from DE-A-28 49 227. The 
implement in that document provides for a robot arm construction 
by means of which teat cups are successively engaged and 
moved upwardly by moving the whole robot arm in the upward 
direction. This working method seems to be rather time 
consuming. In this respect a more favourable construction will 
be obtained when the implement, as described in the opening 
paragraph, is characterized in that a teat cup is mounted, 
movable in upward direction, against one of said portions, 
said portion forming a robot arm end portion. In such an 
implement the robot construction already carries all the teat 
cups, while it is no longer necessary to move the whole robot 
arm in the upward direction to connect the teat cups. More 
particular, according to the invention the teats cups are 
individually movable in the upward direction. This individual 
movability of the teat cups relative to the robot arm end 
portion, combined with the way of moving of the robot arm end 
portion itself facilitates the connection of the teat cups to 
the teats of the animal.  To obtain an efficient adaptation to the position 
and orientation of the teats a teat cup may be pivotably 
coupled to the robot arm end portion. In a specific embodiment a teat cup is mounted to a 
teat cup carrier which is movable in the upward direction 
under control of an operating cylinder. This movement may be 
transferred by a lever mechanism, while in that case the 
operating cylinder will be pivotably mounted at least partly 
in the robot arm end portion. According a further aspect of the invention the 
teat cup is pulled or clamped against the robot arm end 
portion by means of an operating cylinder and a flexible 
connecting member connected between said operating cylinder 
and the teat cup. By releasing the operating cylinder when a 
teat cup is connected to a teat of an animal to be milked the 
teat cup can freely move relative to the robot arm end 
portion. In a further embodiment a teat cup may be provided 
with a connection arm that is arranged pivotably about a pin 
to a connection member to which connection member the 
flexible connecting member is connected. For a better understanding of the invention

<CLAIMS>
Implement for milking animals, such as cows, 
comprising a milking parlour and a robot arm (7) able to 

carry teat cups (80) which can automatically be connected to 
the teats of an animal, the robot arm (7) having portions 

(61, 62) which are slidable relative to each other, characterized 
in that a teat cup (80) is mounted, movable in upward 

direction, against one (62) of said portions, said portion 
forming a robot arm end portion. 
Implement as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the teat cups (80) are individually movable in the 

upward direction. 
Implement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a teat cup (80) is pivotably coupled to the robot arm 

end portion (62). 
Implement as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that a teat cup (80) is mounted to a teat cup carrier (76) 

which is movable in the upward direction under control of an 
operating cylinder (92). 
Implement as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that the upward movement of the teat cup carrier (76) effecte
d 
by means of the operating cylinder (92) is transferred 

by a lever mechanism (87, 92, 94). 
Implement as claimed in claim 5, characterized in 
that the operating cylinder (92) is pivotably mounted at 

least partly in the robot arm end portion (62). 
Implement as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the teat cup (80) is pulled or 

clamped against the robot arm end portion (62) by means of an 
operating cylinder (72) and a flexible connecting member (81) 

connected between said operating cylinder (72) and the teat 
cup (80). 
Implement as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that by releasing the operating cylinder (72) when a teat cup 

(80) is connected to a teat of an animal to be milked the 
teat cup (80) can freely move relative to the robot arm end 

portion (62). 
Implement as claimed in claim 7 or 8, characterized 
in that a teat cup (80) is provided with a connection arm 

(111) that is arranged pivotably about a pin (112) to a 
connection member (113) to which connection member (113) the 

flexible connecting member (81) is connected. 
Implement as claimed in claim 9, characterized in 
that the extension of the pin (112) passes through the centre 

of the aperture of the teat (80).
