<ABSTRACT>
A method and a system for establishing communication between two users (A, B) over at least one telecommunication network (N1-N5). The invention is characterized in that communication is established in the form of a meeting between the users (A and B). The users cooperate in the establishment of the meeting by the first user A sending a meeting request to an intermediary (1), called meeting broker, which negotiates with the users in order to establish the conditions under which the proposed meeting shall take place. A connection between the users (A) and (B) is not established on the initiative of the meeting broker until both users (A) and (B) are in agreement with the conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the area of
communication services supplied over selected telecommunication
networks.More specifically, although not exclusively, the
invention relates to a method of organizing communication
between at least two users, of which a first user
wishes to communicate with a second user through the
medium of at least one telecommunication network.The present invention is related to the following five
Patent Applications, to which the following description
refers:
(1) "A Method of Establishing an Intelligent Network
Service", OUR WO 93/16543;(2) "A Method of Establishing a Connection",
OUR WO 93/16544;(3) "A Method of Establishing Cooperation with a
Functionality", OUR WO 93/16547;(4) "A Paging Method", OUR WO 93/16564;
and(5) "A Method of Supporting Communication",
OUR WO 93/16546.By communication services is meant conventional telephony
services, telex services, datapack services,
datel services, telefax services, videotext services,
ISDN-services, mobile telephony services, personal 
paging services, tele-point-services and general
communication between two or more parties. The services
recited above are only examples of the services
possible and are not intended to limit the scope of
the invention.By telecommunication network is normally meant the
telephone networks, telex networks, circuit connected
data networks, picture information transfer networks,
private telecommunication networks, radio networks,
satellite communication networks and general carriers
of the communication services, such as analog transmission,
digital transmission, synchronous, multiplex
or asynchronous multiplex transmission, ATM, etc., for
example. These networks are recited solely by way of
example and the invention is not restricted thereto.By functionality is meant the ability to perform an
operation in a telecommunication network. Examples of
functionality include activities and services that can
be performed in the telecommunication network. Examples
of functionalities include an enquiry to establish
a connection path or route between two parties,
digit analysis, billing or ticketing. Although not
necessary, the functionality may require the availability
of dedicated equipment for carrying out the
functionality. For instance, if the functionality is
to receive tones and to analyze tones, it is necessary
to make a tone receiver accessible. Other examples of
functionalities include voice-controlled speech information,
number translation service, conference calls.
