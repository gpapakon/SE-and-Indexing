<ABSTRACT>
Improved relay which consists of a casing (1) equipped with a closing base (2), containing, within a functional assembly, formed by a base part (10) which, by its own shape, forms the body (11) provided for the coil of an electromagnet, in the sense that, on the said base (10) a support piece (8) in incorporated, which is fixed by means of the solenoid itself (13) of the electromagnet, in a "U" shape, while on this support piece (8) there is rocking metal part (7), which is attracted by a spring (9) which tends to keep it spaced away from the electromagnet.

<CLAIMS>
Relay constituted by a recipient casing (1) provided with a base for closure
(2) and means (5) serving for fixation at the place of application, while, inside,

there is provided a mechanism formed by an electromagnet (6) and a mobile piece
(7) which is disposed for pivoting assembly on a corresponding support (8),

   characterized in that the mobile piece (7) is disposed on the support (8) by
fitting therein via lateral journals (19) which perform the role of shafts for

rotation, said piece (7) being drawn at the rear, where it forms an upwardly bent
end (16) in the form of a "U", by means of a spring (9) incorporated between the

free edge of the extreme configuration (16) mentioned and the assembly support
(8).
Relay according to Claim 1, characterized in that the electromagnet (6) is
constituted on a base piece (10) in the form of a rectangular plate, on which a

formation (11) integrally projects which forms the coil body for winding the
corresponding coil (12) of said electromagnet (6).
Relay according to Claim 2, characterized in that the core of the electromagnet
(6) is constituted by a metallic U-shaped piece (13) which is incorporated

by axial insertion via one of its arms in the formation (11) which forms the body
of the coil (12), while, with the other arm, it passes through the rectangular plate,

being inserted on the other side in a housing (21) of the support (8) of the
pivoting piece (7), securing of said support (8) thus being ensured by this same

piece (13) of the core.
Relay according to Claim 1, characterized in that the pivoting mobile piece
(7) is constituted by a metal pallet (15) which is assembled rigidly, by caulking or

the like, on a rear bearing piece (16) which forms the hooking of the tension
spring (9), and the journals (19) for rotatable assembly on the support (8). 
Relay according to Claim 2, characterized in that the closure base (2)
forms a wall (24) for fit in the recipient casing (1), said wall (24) of the base (2)

and the very wall of the casing (1) forming respective reciprocal formations (25,
26) for a fixing clip for retention in the assembly; while the base piece (10) which

bears the coil body (11) for the electromagnet (6) in turns forms, level with the
mentioned wall (24) of the base (2), other reciprocal formations (27, 28) serving

to fix a respective clip for retention in the assembly, which piece (10) which bears
the coil body (11) further presents horizontal projecting flanges (29) by means of

which this piece is in turn fixed by blocking between the casing (1) and the base

(2), making it possible to maintain fixed distances within the assembly.
