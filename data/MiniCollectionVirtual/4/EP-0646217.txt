<ABSTRACT>
Described is a camshaft drive for the outlet and inlet valves and for actuating the fuel-injection pump (6) of a diesel engine, the invention calling for the three actuation functions to be carried out by the same cam (2) indirectly via a rocker arm (3, 5) for each cylinder.

<CLAIMS>
Cam drive by way of a camshaft for the outlet valve and the 
inlet valve and for the actuation of the injection pump (6) in 

a diesel engine, in which case only one cam (2) is provided per 
cylinder for actuating the three functions, which cam acts in 

each case indirectly by way of a rocking lever, characterized in 
that the actuation of the injection pump (6) by the cam (2) takes 

place by way of a rocker arm (5), and that the spacing of the 
rocker arm swivel axis (20) from the connecting line between the 

point of engagement (26) of the rocker arm (5) with the cam (2) 
and the point of en
gagement (25) of the rocker arm (5) with the 
plunger (13) amounts to less than 40% of the length of the 

connecting line and that this spacing as well as the lever 
transmission with respect to the rocker arm swivel axis are 

chosen so that with a pump stroke of 10 mm maximum, the speed 
profile for the plunger speed of the injection pump, with respect 

to the cam angle, ascends more steeply than for the two valves. 
Cam drive according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
spacing amounts to between 5% and 15%. 
Cam drive according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
rocker arm (5) is constructed to be elongated in an approximately 

linear manner.
