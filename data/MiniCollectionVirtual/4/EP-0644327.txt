<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pumping apparatus of the rotary distributor type includes a fluid 
pressure actuable spill valve member (43) operable to terminate delivery 

of fuel through an outlet (18) from a bore (14) containing the pumping 
plungers (15). The valve member is moved to the open position by an 

actuating piston (44). One end of the cylinder (40) containing the 
actuating piston is connected to a low pressure source (35) of fuel by 

way of a non-return valve (37) and the same end of the cylinder can be 
connected by a control valve (26) to a high pressure source of fuel when 

spillage of fuel is required. Associated with the piston (44) is a balance 
piston (46) and the two pistons define a flow path for fuel from the one 

end of the cylinder (40) to the bore (14) to ensure that the bore is 
completely full of fuel prior to the next delivery of fuel through an outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a 
compression ignition engine and of the kind comprising a pumping 
plunger slidable within a bore, a cam for imparting inward movement to 
the plunger in timed relationship with the associated engine, means for 
distributing fuel displaced from the bore during successive inward 
movements of the plunger to a plurality of outlets in turn, said outlets in 
use being connected to the injection nozzles respectively of the 
associated engine, a spill valve operable to spill fuel from the bore 
during inward movement of the plunger, an actuating piston slidable 
within a cylinder, the actuating piston being biased by first resilient 
means towards an end wall of the cylinder, said spill valve comprising a 
valve member which is carried by the actuating piston and a seating 
which is formed in said end wall of the cylinder about a passage 
communicating with said bore, valve means for admitting fluid under 
pressure into the cylinder to effect an initial movement of the actuating 
piston away from said end wall thereby lifting the valve member from 
the seating to allow fuel to spill from the bore into the cylinder and 
effect further movement of the actuating piston, a drilling formed in the 
actuating piston, the diameter of said drilling being slightly greater than 
the effective seat diameter of the valve member and seating, a balance 
piston slidable in said drilling, second resilient means biasing the balance 
piston in the direction towards said one end wall of the cylinder, a stop 
to limit the movement of the balance piston in the direction away from 
said end wall of the cylinder, a passage in the valve member and 
actuating piston whereby the balance piston is subjected to the fuel 
pressure in the bore and means for supplying fuel to the bore to  
 
replenish the fuel lost through leakage and the fuel displaced to the 
associated engine. An apparatus of the kind specified is described in EP-A-0453145 and as 
described the purpose of the balance piston is to absorb the initial 
quantity of fuel displaced by the plunger. Moreover, the means for 
supplying fuel to the bore comprises a low pressure fuel supply pump 
the outlet of which is connected to the bore through a series of passages 
formed in a rotary distributor member which cooperate in turn with an 
inlet port in a housing. The distributor member also houses the bore and 
the plunger and provides by means of a delivery passage communicating 
with the bore, the

A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a compression 
ignition engine comprising a pumping plunger (15) slidable within a bore 

(14), a cam (23) for imparting inward movement to the plunger in timed 
relationship with the associated engine, means (12, 17) for distributing 

fuel displaced from the bore during successive inward movements of the 
plunger to a plurality of outlets (19) in turn, said outlets in use being 

connected to the injection nozzles respectively of the associated engine,

movement of the plunger, an actuating piston (44) slidable within a 
cylinder (40), the actuating piston being biased by first resilient means 

(47) towards an end wall (41) of the cylinder, said spill valve comprising 
a valve member (43) which is carried by the actuating piston (44) and a 

seating which is formed in said end wall of the cylinder about a passage 
(42) communicating with said bore, control valve means (27, 33) for 

admitting fluid under pressure into the cylinder to effect an initial 
movement of the actuating piston (41) away from said end wall (41)

actuating piston, a drilling (45) formed in the actuating piston, the 
diameter of said drilling being slightly greater than the effective seat 

diameter of the valve member (43) and seating, a balance piston (46) 
slidable in said drilling, second resilient means (52) biasing the balance 

piston in the direction towards said one end wall (41) of the cylinder, a 
stop (53) to limit the movement of the balance piston in the direction 

away from said end wall of the cylinder, and a passage in the valve  
 

member and actuating piston whereby the balance piston is subjected to 
the fuel pressure in the bore, characterised in that said actuating piston

said bore (14) to a source (34) of fuel under pressure thereby to replenish

valve (37) connected intermediate said further valve means and 

the source (34) of fuel.
