<ABSTRACT>
The knife (10) has a blade(13) retractable into a hollow handle (11) which includes an energy-storing spring (16) and a locking arrangement (19,20). The locking arrangement is disengaged by a relay (28) connected to a lock (29) and an electromagnet (32) supplied by a voltage source (24). The electrical circuit (25,31), during handling of the knife, can be interrupted by a switch (23) and is closed when the knife is not in a persons's hand. An inertial mass or an acceleration sensor can be used to release the locking mechanism.

<CLAIMS>
Knife (10) having a knife blade (13) which is guided in
a hollow handle body (11) and has a holding extension (14)

which, on the one hand, is acted upon rearwards in its
direction of retraction in the longitudinal direction of

the handle body by a first energy store (16) and, on the
other hand, is constructed as part of a locking device (19,

20) which, when engaged, holds the knife blade (13) in the
extended working position and, when disengaged, causes the

said knife blade (13) to retract into the hollow handle
body (11) under the influence of the energy store (16),


characterised in that
 the disengagement system of the
locking device (19, 20) has an electromagnet (32) which is

to be actuated by a voltage source (24) via a relay (28) in
conjunction with a delayed-release contact (29), and the

current circuits (25, 31) of which can be interrupted,
during handling of the knife (10), by a switch (22, 23)

which must compulsorily be actuated, and are closed when
the knife (10) is put down.
Knife according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
current circuits (25, 31) for the relay (28) with the

delayed-release contact, and also for the electromagnet
(32), can be interrupted, against the force of a second

energy store (26), by the switch (22, 23) which must
compulsorily be actuated, and are closed, under the

influence of the second energy store (26), when the knife
(10) is put down.
Knife according to claim 1 or according to claim 2,

characterised in that
 the response time of the delayed-release
contact (29) can be set from zero to approximately

one minute.
Knife according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised
in that
 the disengagement system for the locking device 
(19, 20) is formed by a locking pin (20), as the locking

device (19, 20), which catches in a recess (19) in the
holding extension (14) and can be drawn out of the said

recess (19) by the electromagnet (32) in the course of
disengagement.
Knife according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised
in that
 the first energy store consists either of an
electromagnet or, in a manner known 
per se
, of a
cylindrical helical spring (16) which extends in the

longitudinal direction of the hollow handle body (11) and
is fastened, by one end (16b), to the holding extension

(14) and, by its other end (16a), to the inner wall (17) of
the handle body (11).
Knife according to one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised
in that
 the second energy store (26) likewise consists of a
spring, such as a helical compression spring (26), which

acts, with one end, upon an inner wall of the handle body
(11) and, with its other end, on the switch (23) which can

always be pressed or drawn into its closing position (arrow
27) by the spring (26) under a preliminary tension.
Knife according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
first energy store consists of a helical spring (16) which

is cylindrical and also loaded either in compression or in
tension and which is also subject to a preliminary tension.
Knife according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised
in that
 the voltage/current source (24) consists either of
a battery which is likewise disposed in or on the handle

body (11), or of a low-voltage cable with a voltage of 6 to
12 volts, which cable is routed into the said handle body

(11) and is connected, via a low-voltage transformer, to an
ordinary, 220-volt voltage source. 
Knife according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised
in that
 the relay (28) and the delayed-release contact (29)
are connected to the voltage/current source (24) in

parallel with the electromagnet (32).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised
in that
 the relay (28) and the delayed-release contact (29)
are accommodated in the handle body (11).
