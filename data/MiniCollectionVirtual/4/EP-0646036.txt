<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible physical training device with elastic resistance elements has been developed which can be integrated into a living area or into furniture and other built-in units owing to its modest size. It can be folded flat and is so light that it can be pivotably secured anywhere. Owing to the wide variety of ways in which the elastic resistance elements on which the user exercises can be arranged, all muscle groups can be developed. It has all the features of heavy training equipment and is stable but requires only a little space and no extra rooms. It could be made more easily slidable by the use of rails. The force exerted can be monitored by strain gauges and thus an eye can be kept on the results of training.
