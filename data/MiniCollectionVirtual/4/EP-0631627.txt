<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns the production of useful proteins to the growth medium of yeast by using the hsp150 protein or fragments or derivates thereof as a carrier. The authentic hsp150 protein, encoded by the H

The signal sequence of the hsp150 protein, or another signal sequence, guides the fusion protein to the secretory pathway, and the hsp150-carrier takes it to the medium, from where it is harvested. During secretion, the protein product may or may not be detached from the hsp150 carrier by proteolytic enzymes, according to the occurrence of natural or created cleavage sites at the carrier-product junction.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF PROTEINS IN YEASTFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention comprises a method, by which useful proteins are secreted through the secretory route of yeast while being posttranslationally modified. The production and secretion is achieved by transformation of yeast cells with a recombinant DNA vector containing the isolated or synthesized HSP150 gene, or a fragment or derivative thereof, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or another yeast, joined to a gene encoding a foreign protein. The fusion gene is expressed under the control of the HSP150 control elements or other control elements.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTThe secretory route of yeastThe yeast cells offer an alternative for the prokaryotes for the production of heterologous proteins by recombinant DNA- technology mainly because they can secrete proteins via the secretory pathway to the exterior of the plasma membrane, either to the cell wall or to the growth medium (Terkamp- Olson and Valenzuela, Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 1:28-35, 1990). The secretory pathway of yeast consists of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles, and it operates similarly as the mammalian secretory pathway. A nascent or newly synthesized polypeptide crosses the ER membrane due to its signal sequence, and is translocated to the lumen of the ER. Vesicles bud off from the ER membrane and fuse with the Golgi membrane and thus transport secretory proteins to the Golgi. The Golgi consists of many membrane-bound compartments through which the secretory proteins pass by vesicular traffic. The vesicles which bud off from the last Golgi subcompartment, fuse with the plasma membrane, and 

thus the soluble contents of the secretory vesicles are delivered to the cell wall, or to the growth medium. The enzymes resident in the compartments of the secretory route modify secretory proteins with glycans, proteolytic cleavages, disulfide bonds, fatty acylation, oligomeriza ion etc. (Sche man, Annu Rev. Cell Biol. 1:115-143, 1985). These modifications occur similarly, though not identically, in yeast and mammalian cells. For instance, the glycans are different in these two organisms (Ballou, The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Strathern, Jones and Broach (eds.) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, pp. 335-360, 1992). The modifications yield a protein molecule whose conformation is correct or more correct than that of a protein produced in prokaryotic cells (Curtis et al.. PNAS 88:5809-5813, 1991).
