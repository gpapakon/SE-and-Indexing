<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to genetic
sequences encoding flavonoid 3'-hydroxylases or
fragments or derivatives thereof and their use in the
manipulation of pigmentation in plants and other
organisms.The flower industry strives to develop new and different varieties of flowering plants.
An effective way to create such novel varieties is through the manipulation of flower
colour. Classical breeding techniques have been used with some success to produce
a wide range of colours for most of the commercial varieties of flowers. This
approach has been limited, however, by the constraints of a particular species' gene
pool and for this reason it is rare for a single species to have a full spectrum of
coloured varieties. In addition, traditional breeding techniques lack precision. The
aesthetic appeal of the flower is a combination of many factors such as form, scent
and colour; modification of one character through hybridization can often be at the
expense of an equally valuable feature. The ability to engineer precise colour
changes in cutflower and ornamental species would offer significant commercial
opportunities in an industry which has rapid product turnover and where novelty is
an important market characteristic.Flower colour is predominantly due to two types of pigment: flavonoids and
carotenoids. Flavonoids contribute to a range of colours from yellow to red to blue.
Carotenoids impart an orange or yellow tinge and are commonly the major pigment
in yellow or orange flowers. The flavonoid molecules which make the major
contribution to flower colour are the anthocyanins which are glycosylated derivatives
of cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin, malvidin and pelargonidin, and are
localised in the vacuole. The different anthocyanins can produce marked differences
in colour. Flower colour is also influenced by co-pigmentation with colourless
flavonoids, metal complexation, glycosylation, acylation and vacuolar pH (Forkmann, 
1991).The biosynthetic pathway for the flavonoid pigments (hereinafter referred to as the
"flavonoid pathway') is well established and is shown in Figure 1 (Ebel and
Hahlbrock, 1988; Hahlbrock and Grisebach,1979; Wiering and De Vlaming, 1984;
Schram et al, 1984; Stafford, 1990). The first committed step in the pathway
involves the condensation of three molecules of malonyl-CoA with one molecule of
p-coumaroyl-CoA. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme chalcone synthase
(CHS). The product of this reaction, 2',4,4',6', tetrahydroxy-chalcone, is normally
rapidly
