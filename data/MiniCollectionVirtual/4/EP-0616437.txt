<ABSTRACT>
Orbiting satellites (12) project footprints (30) on the 
earth. Each footprint (30) is divided into cells (28). Footprints 

(30) of nearby satellites (12) overlap one another, and the 
overlap increases as satellites (12) approach a pole from the 

equator. Positions of all cells (28) generated by all satellites 
(12) are simulated (36) at numerous points throughout an orbit. 

Channel sets are assigned to cells (28) within a reference 
footprint (30a). This assignment is propagated throughout all 

footprints (30) except for those footprints (30) residing 
adjacent one side of a seam (16) between orbits (14) where 

satellites (12) travel in opposing directions. The channel sets 
are assigned near the seam (16) in response to previously 

assigned channel sets. Each satellite (12) stores channel set 
assignments for its cells (28) at various points throughout its 

orbit. All satellites (12) switch their communication 
parameters simultaneously in response to the channel set 

assignments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to communication
systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to
systems that divide an area within which communications are
to take place into cells and which reuse spectrum among
certain ones of the cells.Conventional cellular communication systems adopt a
frequency reuse plan. Generally speaking, system antennas are
erected at spaced apart locations. Each system antenna, along
with transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, and geographical
features, defines a cell. A cell is a geographical area on and
near the surface of the earth within which communications
may take place via a subscriber unit having predetermined 
operating characteristics and via the cell's antenna. In a
cellular system that efficiently uses the spectrum allocated to
it, system antennas are located to minimize overlap between
their respective cells and to reduce gaps between the cells.The spectrum allocated to a conventional cellular system
is divided into a few discrete portions, typically frequency
bands. Each cell is allocated only one of the discrete portions
of the spectrum, and each cell is preferably surrounded by cells
that use other discrete portions of the spectrum.
Communications within a cell use only the discrete portion of
the spectrum allocated to the cell, and interference between
communications taking place in other nearby cells is
minimized because communications in such nearby cells use
different portions of the spectrum. Co-channel cells are cells
that reuse the same discrete portion of spectrum. To minimize
interference, the frequency reuse plan spaces co-channel cells
a minimum predetermined distance apart.A cellular communication system which places antennas in
moving orbits around the earth faces particular problems
related to distributing discrete portions of the allocated
spectrum to various cells. Due to the approximately spherical
shape of the earth, cells which do not overlap in one region of
the earth, such as the equator, may very well overlap in other
regions, such as polar regions. When cells overlap, the co-channel
cells that the overlapping cells are spacing apart
reside closer together than permitted by the spectrum reuse
plan. Interference between communications taking place in
such closely spaced co-channel cells becomes more likely.In addition, when antennas move relative to each other, the
overlap between cells changes as a function of time. Any
allocation of discrete portions of the spectrum to the cells
remains valid only until relative
