<ABSTRACT>
A digital coding method for the transmission and/or storage of acoustic signals and, in particular, of music signals is described, in which samples of the acoustic signal are transformed, by means of a transformation or a filter bank, into a sequence of second samples which reproduce the spectral composition of the acoustic signal, this sequence of second samples is quantised with different accuracy in accordance with the requirements and is partially or wholly coded by means of an optimum coder, and in which a corresponding decoding and inverse transformation takes place during the reproduction. The method according to the invention is distinguished by the fact that a coder is used in a manner known per se, in which the probability of occurrence of the quantised spectral coefficient is correlated with the length of the code in such a manner that the more frequently the spectral coefficient occurs, the shorter the code word, and that, for reducing the size of the table of the coder, one code word and, if necessary, an additional code are allocated either to a number of elements of the sequence or to a value range, and that some of the variable-length code words are arranged in a raster, and that the remaining code words are distributed in the remaining gaps so that the start of the code word can be found more easily without complete decoding or in the case of errored transmission.
