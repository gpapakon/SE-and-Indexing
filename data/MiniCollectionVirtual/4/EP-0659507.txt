A cobalt metal powder as binder metal for the
production of diamond tools and/or hard metal tools

and/or wear-resistant coatings, characterised in that
20 to 80 wt.% of the powder consists of an atomised

cobalt metal powder having optically determined
particle sizes of from 5 to 150 µm and the balance to

100 wt.% consists of an optionally agglomerated cobalt
powder having an optically determined primary particle

size of less than 3 µm.
