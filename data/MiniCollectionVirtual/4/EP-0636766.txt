<ABSTRACT>
Turbo machine stator composed of a metal casing (2) surrounding a housing (3) bearing bearings (11) for pivots (10) of pivoting vanes (7). The mechanism (15) for controlling the pitch of the vanes (7) in particular comprises a radial rod (20) to which the thrust forces of the gases are transmitted, the casing (3) advantageously being formed of angular sectors of rings juxtaposed axially and which are not loaded. The bearings (11) therefore are not subjected to wear which would give rise to leakage of gases and losses in efficiency (output). Advantageously the casing is made of a composite material.

<CLAIMS>
A turbomachine stator having vanes (7) pivotable 
around pivots (10) engaged in bearings (11) of an envelope (3) 

formed by annular members juxtaposed axially by assembly means 
(40, 41) allowing relative axial movements of the annular 

members, the envelope (3) bounding a gas flow path (4) into 
which the vanes (7) extend, a casing (2) extending around the 

envelope, the pivots being connected by rods (13, 113) to a 
drive ring or drive ring sector (14) outside the envelope (3), 

the drive ring (14, 114) being moved by a drive mechanism (15, 
115) comprising a spindle (20) engaged in a bearing (32) of 

the casing (2), the annular members consisting of angular 
sectors separated by clearances (46), characterised in that 

the clearances (46) are closed by seals (47), the envelope is 
made of a composite material and the casing is made of 

titanium. 
A stator according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the drive mechanism comprises a lever (21, 121) connected to 

the spindle (20), the lever being formed with a slot (37) in 
which an element connected to the drive ring (14, 114) slides. 
A stator according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the element is formed with an eccentric (35) for adjusting the 

drive ring relatively to the lever. 
A stator according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the pivotable vanes (7) are distributed 

in two stages each driven by an individual drive ring (114),  
 

the drive mechanism (115) being adapted to drive the two rings 
by way of the spindle (20). 
A stator according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the pivotable vanes (7) are distributed 

in two stages each driven by an individual drive ring (14), 
and it comprises two drive mechanisms (15) associated with a 

respective drive ring and disposed on diametrically opposite 
sides of the stator. 
A stator according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that that the pivotable vanes (7) are 

distributed in two stages each driven by a pair of individual 
drive half-rings (214), and it comprises two drive mechanisms 

(115) disposed on diametrically opposite sides of the stator 
and each associated with a pair of half-rings of different 

stages.
