<ABSTRACT>
The winding device for flexible sheet-like structures (44), especially printed products, such as newspapers, periodicals and parts thereof, consists of a winding core (16) rotatably mounted in a frame (12) and driveable by a drive shaft (28) and of a winding band (24) which guides the flexible sheet-like structures (44) essentially tangentially onto the winding core and which is wound, together with the sheet-like structures, onto the winding core. A drive train consisting of a driving-belt pulley (38), of a drive belt (40) and of a drive-belt pulley (42) makes it possible to rotate the rotary shaft (14), on which the winding core (16) is rotatably mounted, by the same motor (30) as the band reel (26). Located between the winding core (16) and the rotary shaft (14) is a spiral spring (18) which is fastened at one end (20) to the winding core and at its other end (22) to the rotary shaft (14). The arrangement is such that the end (22) of the spring (18) can be moved relative to the spring end (20), in order to change the state of tension of the spring. The device makes it possible in this way to match the torque exerted on the winding core to the increasing winding diameter during the winding of the winding band (24) together with the sheet-like structures (44). There is no need for any regulation.
