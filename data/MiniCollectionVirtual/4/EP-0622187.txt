<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat-sealable, shrinkable, multilayered polypropylene film comprising at least a base layer containing polypropylene or a polypropylene mixture, and at least one top layer containing a mixture or blend of two components I and II. The mixture contains copolymers and terpolymers of  alpha -olefins having 2 to 10 carbon atoms and HDPE. The film has a longitudinal shrinkage of
