<ABSTRACT>
A slide member is made of an aluminum alloy and compositely 
reinforced at its sliding surface by a reinforcing material. The 

reinforcing material is a mixture of alumina short fibers consisting of 
not less than 80 wt.% alumina and the remainder silica and having 5-60 

wt.% alpha alumina content, and non-spherical mullite particles 
consisting of 40-86 wt.% alumina and the remainder silica and having 

3-60 microns mean diameter. The volumetric percentages of the 
alumina short fibers and the mullite particles are 2-12% and 5-25%, 

respectively, on the basis of the volume of the reinforced portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a slide member made of an 
aluminum alloy, and more particularly, to a slide member made of an 
aluminum alloy and compositely reinforced at a sliding surface portion 
thereof by a reinforcing material. One of such slide members made of an aluminum alloy and 
compositely reinforced at a sliding surface portion thereof by a 
reinforcing material is known from, for example, Japanese Patent 
Publication 3-71939 (1991), to comprise a reinforcing material made of 
a mixture of 8-20 vol.% alumina short fibers and 3-12 vol.% carbon 
fibers. In such a slide member, the combination of the alumina short 
fibers having a high hardness and the carbon fibers having a self-wettability 
furnishes the sliding surface portion of the slide member 
with an improved anti-wearing performance as compared with a slide 
member comprising a reinforcing material made of only the alumina 
short fibers. However, the alumina short fibers and the carbon fibers are both 
relatively expensive, and therefore, the slide member reinforced by the 
combination of these fiber materials is expensive. Further, such a 
relatively high volumetric percentage of the hard alumina short fibers 
as 8-20 tends to increase the wearing of a mating member which 
slides against the slide member. Therefore, such a known slide 
member is not always most desirable for various purposes.  
 EP-A-0 213 528 discloses a composite material made from 
alumina-silica short fibers embedded in a matrix of metal. 
The alumina-silica short fibers are present in the metal 
matrix in an amount of about 5 to about 50 vol.%. The fibers 
may have an alumina content of at least about 80 %, the 
remainder being silica. Preferably, at least 45 % of 
crystalline mullite is incorporated in the alumina-silica 
short fibers. Moreover, JP-A-60 106 942 refers to amorphous alumosilicate-mullite 
filaments for reinforcing of light metals. In these 
alumosilicate filaments microcrystalline mullite particles 
(grain size ≤ 100 nm) are incorporated in an amount of 10 to 
60 %. The total content of the filaments in the reinforced 
metal is 5 %. Therefore, the mullite content in the 
reinforced metal accounts to 0,5 to 3 %. In view of the above-mentioned problems with respect to the prior 
art aluminum alloy slide member, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a less expensive, high performance aluminum alloy 
slide member which is not only superior in the anti-wearing resistance 
of itself but also less abrasive against a mating member.
