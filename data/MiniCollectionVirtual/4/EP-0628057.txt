<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for treating tissue necrosis (loss) in an animal. Tissue necrosis is treated by providing the subject with an anti-adhesion cell agent capable of binding an ICAM-1 antigen, a CD18 antigen, an L-selectin agent, a CD44 antigen, a P-selectin antigen, a VCAM-1 antigen, an ICAM-2 antigen, or a fragment thereof. Also provided is a method for preventing thermal-related tissue loss or necrosis, particularly the thermal injury and progressive tissue necrosis which results from a burn injury. Thermal-related tissue injury surrounding a thermal injury site is inhibited or prevented by providing an animal with an anti-adhesion agent, such as an anti-CD18 antibody, an anti-ICAM-1 antibody, or a mixture or fragment thereof. A method for inhibiting/preventing scarring attendant healing of a thermal injury is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the role of
inflammatory cells in the extension of tissue necrosis
surrounding a thermally injured tissue. The invention
also relates to the field of therapeutic agents for use in
the prevention and inhibition of tissue
necrosis incident thermal injury in an animal.Thermal injuries result in a cascade of events which
initially produces an area of irreversible tissue
destruction surrounded by a marginal zone of injury with
reduced blood flow. The marginal zone of injury is
referred to as a "zone of stasis". This "zone of stasis"
is recognized as being at high risk of progressive tissue
destruction. Particularly, during the post-injury
period, the zone of stasis is subject to a progressive
extension of the area of tissue loss (necrosis)
surrounding the initially tissue damaged site.The progression of tissue loss is due in part to
microvascular damage at and around the injured site.
Three cellular events are primarily responsible for this
observed microvascular damage. These include:
1) The adherence of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear
neutrophils, PMNs) to capillary endothelial cells
(EC), which induces the release of products toxic to
host tissue; 2) The aggregation of neutrophils, which causes
clogging of capillaries and post-capillary venules;
and3) The local activation of neutrophils to produce
mediators of tissue damage (nitric oxide, etc.).The present invention provides for inhibiting the
progressive tissue destruction typical of post-thermally
injured patients through inhibiting each of
these cellular events.Leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, are central
mediators of microvascular endothelial injury in many
acute pathologic processes.1-4 Leukocytes, particularly
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), monocytes and
lymphocytes may be characterized as inflammatory cells,
as cells of these cell types play some role in the
inflammatory response.1Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are known to play a
central role in inflammatory responses of many types.
During inflammation, PMN-EC adherence results in the
formation of a microenvironment between the PMN and the
EC where PMN derived proteases (such as serine
proteinase, elastase, collagenase and gelatinase), and
toxic oxygen products produced by both the EC and PMN
(such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and the
hydroxyl radical), exist in high local concentrations.1
These highly reactive substances, partially protected
from inactivation by circulating plasma anti-proteases
and free radical scavengers, then produce
