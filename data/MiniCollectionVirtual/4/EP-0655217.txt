<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric vacuum cleaner (1) having a container (8) for a dust bag (9) with a carrier plate (10), which chamber has a textile cover (14) on the outside and an openwork structure (16) on the inside, an electret filter (17) being arranged between the openwork structure (16) and the textile covering (14), and an upper supporting frame (15) for the carrier plate (10) of the dust bag (9) being provided. In order to achieve a design which is more favourable in terms of handling and also as regards improved hygiene, the invention proposes that the openwork structure (16) is removably connected to the supporting frame (15), that the electret filter (17) is fixedly attached to the openwork structure (16) or the supporting frame (15), and that the supporting frame (15) is connected with a catch connection to a holding frame (13) to which the textile covering (14) is fastened, an inward elastic deflection of portions of the supporting frame (15) being necessary to release the catch connection.

Electric vacuum cleaner (1) with a receiving chamber 
(8) for a dust bag (9) with a carrier plate (10) which 

has on the outside a textile covering (14) and on the 
inside a lattice structure (16), an electret filter (17) 

being located between the lattice structure (16) and the 
textile covering (14) and an upper support frame (15) 

being formed for the carrier plate (10) of the dust bag 
(9), characterised in that the lattice structure (16) is 

connected with the support frame (15) so as to be 
removable therewith, in that the electret filter (17) is 

securely attached to the lattice structure (16) or to the 
support frame (15), and in that the support frame (15) is 

latch connected with a retaining frame (13) upon which 
the textile covering (14) is attached, an elastic 

deviation of sections of the support frame (15) in an 
inward direction being necessary in order to release the 

latch connection. 
Electric vacuum cleaner (1) with a receiving chamber 
(8) for a dust bag (9) with a carrier plate (10) which 

has on the outside a textile covering (14) and on the 
inside a lattice structure (16), an electret filter (17) 

being located between the lattice structure (16) and the 
textile covering (14) and an upper support frame (15) 

being formed for the carrier plate (10) of the dust bag 
(9), the support frame (15) having a substantially  

 
rectangular contour, according to claim 1, characterised 

in that latch projections (24) are located preferably 
roughly centrally on the longitudinal sides (23) on the 

support frame (15). 
Electric vacuum cleaner according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that two latch 

projections (24) are provided which lie substantially 
opposite one another. 
Electric vacuum cleaner according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the latch 

projections (24) are in a dovetail shape. 
Electric vacuum cleaner according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that, in order to 

form the latch connection, latch receiving means (22) are 
provided in the retaining frame (13), said latch 

receiving means (22) being provided with undercuts 
corresponding to the latch projections (24), and being 

open in an upward direction.
