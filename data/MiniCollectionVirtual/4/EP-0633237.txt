<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a production method of 
1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane (HFC-43-10mcf) as an 
alternative compound of CFC and HCFC used for refrigerants, foaming 
agents, and cleaning agents, via its intermediate product (precursor) 
3,3-dichloro-1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane. Decafluoropentane can be as an alternative (alternative freon) of 
CFC and HCFC used for refrigerants, foaming agents, and cleaning 
agents. In particular, HFC-43-10mcf, like conventionally used freon, 
is expected to be applied for foam agents, refrigerants, and cleaning 
agents, and has an advantage not to destroy the ozone layer in the 
stratosphere because of no chlorine. However, a production method of HFC-43-10mcf has not been 
completely known in the past. Raw materials to synthesize such  
 
decafluoropentane have not been studied. The object of the invention is to provide a production method of HFC-43-10mcf 
at high yield and industrial scale economically. The present invention relates to a production method of 
1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane which is characterized by reaction 
of tetrafluoroethylene and difluorodichloromethane under the Lewis acid 
catalyst to produce 3,3-dichloro-1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane. 
and by further reduction of the 3,3-dichloro-1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane. In this case, it is desirable to react the reactants contacting the Lewis acid 
catalyst at gaseous and liquid phases at -20 to + 100°C. 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane and 3,3-dichloro-1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane 
obtained in the first step of the method 
of the invention are products shown by the following chemical formulas:  
 
These products are very useful, as they are, as intermediates 
of monomers to produce macromolecular fluorocompounds and many 
intermediate compounds of fluorocompounds, and they can be converted by 
reduction into decafluoropentane, as shown by the following formulas, 
usable for alternatives of CFC and HCFC (alternative freon) applying 
for refrigerants, foaming agents, and cleaning agents. 
2,2-dichloro-1,1,1,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane 
and 3,3-dichloro-1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane 
are materials with boiling 
point of 90 °C and are very useful as described above, but their 
effective production methods have been unknown. The present inventors studied hard the effective 
production method of 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane 
and 3,3-dichloro-1,1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane 
and found that
