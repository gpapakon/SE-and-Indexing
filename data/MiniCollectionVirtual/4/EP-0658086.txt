<ABSTRACT>
A process for converting fresh, low value animal materials into feed products comprises mixing predetermined proportions of fresh, low value animal materials and pumping them through a size reducing means and mixing them in a screw type extruder with starch and protein bearing ingredients such as cereals, cereal substitutes, rice, gluten and root crops to produce a cooked extrudate suitable for use, for example, as a pet food or snack product, which can be specifically tailored to meet all the end consumer's nutritional requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESSING LOW VALUE ANIMAL PRODUCTSThe present invention relates to a process for converting into a feed product, low value materials remaining in an animal processing plant after most of the flesh has been removed from the animal carcasses. Such materials typically include bones with meat attached and other low value products such as offal.Traditionally this material is sold to renderers who produce from such material meat and bone meal and tallow for use in the animal feeds and cosmetic industries. Due to a restricted demand for such products, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult for meat processing plants to sell their low value material and indeed, in many cases, it is necessary for the processing plant to pay in order to dispose of it.Off-site processing of this material is also becoming less attractive as the transport of such material is controlled in the UK under the Animal By-Products Order 1992 and equivalent legislation in other EC countries to implement Council Directive 90/667/EEC. The cost of such transport is high since 60-80% of the material is water which must be driven off during the rendering process. In practice this cost is borne by the meat processing plant.There exists a substantial and growing technical problem for the meat industry to sell this material at a reasonable price or without incurring a loss.Accordingly, in the present invention a process is provided which enables the low value material to be 

processed at the meat processing plant thus eliminating the need for transportation and its associated cost. The process is capable of using a wet feedstock of the low value material and added ingredients and utilises all of the low value material produced, thereby eliminating storage problems prior to collection. The only unusable effluent from the process is water in the form of steam which can be readily recondensed and treated.Depending on the added ingredients, the product can be adapted to numerous purposes, for example, sale as feed for all livestock, including pets, cattle, pigs, poultry or fish. If the processing plant is handling a single species of animal, there is the added advantage of being able to channel the resultant feedstuff exclusively into feeding different species. This is not the case for rendered meat and bone meal which contains waste material from many species. This process can also be used for production of snacks containing meat and cereals for human consumption, although it should be appreciated that a higher value meat component would

C AIMS
1. A process for converting fresh low value animal material into a feed product comprising the step of extruding it in a twin screw extruder (38) with a starch providing ingredient in order to produce an expanded cooked product, characterised in that the process further comprises a size reduction step such that the maximum particle size of the material at the input of the extruder is in the range of 0.3 to 3mm; in that the water content of the input material is controlled; and in that the resulting extruded product is dried as a separate step in the process.
2. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the particle size of the input animal material is in the range 0.3 to 0.5mm.
3. A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the water content controlling step is regulated to ensure the water content at the extruder output is up to 40%.
4. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the low value material is transferred from an adjacent meat, poultry or fish processing plant.
5. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the starch providing ingredient is selected from cereals, cereal substitutes, oil seeds, rice or root crops.
6. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the proportions of offal and bone 


 with meat in the low value animal material is controllable.
7. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the proportions of low value animal material and starch-providing ingredient is in the range 2:1 to 1:10.
8. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein liquid in the form of one or more of water, steam, oil or blood is added at the extruder.
9. A plant adapted for carrying out the process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
10. A plant adapted for carrying out processing of fresh low value animal material into an expanded food product comprising: mincing means (4, 14, 24, 26, 28, 30, 34) for reducing the maximum particle size of said animal material to within the range 0.3 to 3mm at an output (A); feed means (24, 40, 42, 44, 22) for supplying at an output (B) at least one additional ingredient providing starch; a twin screw extruder (38) having an input connected to the outputs (A, B) of the said mincing means and feed means and an output; liquid supply means (40) for controlling water content of the input of the extruder (38) ; and drying means (52) connected to the extruder output for drying the extruded expanded product.
