<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optically non-linear active waveguiding 
material comprising an optically transparent polymer and a donor group 

and acceptor group-containing triphenylcarbinol as a dopant. 
Said dopants have a high hyperpolarisability and have a charge-transfer 

absorption band which is about the same as that of their 
corresponding compounds having only one donor-π-acceptor unit. The 

triphenylcarbinols were found to display good solubility in polymers. 
Nitro-functionalised triphenylcarbinols are preferred because of their 

charge-transfer absorption band at a low wavelength (λ
max
 at about 290 
nm). Aldehyde-functionalised calix(4)arenes were also found to have 

this low wavelength charge-transfer absorption band (λ
max
 at about 270 
nm). Triphenyls comprising stilbene donor-π-acceptor units are 

preferred because of their high hyperpolarisability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optically non-linear active waveguiding 
material comprising an optically transparent polymer and an optically 
non-linear active dopant comprising a donor-π-acceptor unit. In optically non-linear materials, non-linear polarisation occurs 
under the influence of an external field of force (such as an electric 
field of force). In the case of organic molecules this is called an 
induced dipole moment. The induced dipole moment (µind) may be 
represented as follows:

µind = αE + βEE + γEEE + ....   [1] 


 
wherein α stands for the linear hyperpolarisability, β represents the 
(non-linear) hyperpolarisability, γ stands for the second hyperpolarisability, 
etc. Non-linear electric polarisation (β and γ do not equal zero) may give 
rise to a number of optically non-linear phenomena, such as frequency 
doubling and Pockels effect. By utilising these phenomena it is 
possible to employ this material in optically active waveguiding 
structures such as optical switches, frequency doublers, etc. To this end the organic, optically non-linear active material should 
be applied to a substrate in the form of thin layers with the aid of 
one of three suitable polymer systems: guest-host polymer systems, 
functionalised polymers, and polymer networks. In the first system, 
which is by far the easiest to prepare, an optically transparent 
polymer contains optically non-linear active compounds as dopants.  Such an optically non-linear active waveguiding material is disclosed 
in GB 2 189 624, where an optically transparent polymer is impregnated 
with an optically non-linear dopant comprising a donor-π-acceptor 
unit. Most organic, optically non-linear active compounds owe their non-linear 
optical properties to so-called donor-π-acceptor units. By this 
term are meant, groups composed of an electron-donating group and an 
electron-accepting group coupled to the same conjugated π-system. 
Compounds containing such a material were found to have a 
comparatively high hyperpolarisability (β). For several years now efforts have been made in industry to prepare 
materials of a higher hyperpolarisability, for instance by expanding 
the donor-π-acceptor units. While the hyperpolarisability is thus 
increased, there is, simultaneously, a shift in the charge-transfer 
absorption band to a longer wavelength. In consequence, this material 
has limited applicability in the case of, say, frequency doubling. 
For, it is inadvisable for the optically non-linear material to have 
absorption bands in the very
