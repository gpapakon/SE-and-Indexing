<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for facilitating toilet visits essentially for an adult person with impaired mobility. A support part (1) is so arranged as to be installed on a toilet pan (4), in conjunction with which its regular toilet seat must be removed. A frame part (2) supports a seat ring (5) and is pivotally attached in at least two points (6, 7) with the support part (1). A straight line (8), which passes through the aforementioned points (6, 7), represents an imaginary axis of rotation which forms a line perpendicular to a plane of symmetry through the toilet pan (4) and lies ahead of its front edge (4b). A device (3) acts between the support part (1) and the frame part (2) causing the frame part (2) to rotate relative to the support part (1) between an inclined position in which the person in question can support himself with his back against the seat ring and a seated position in which the person can attend to his needs. The aforementioned device (3) acting between the support part (1) and the frame part (2) lies in the aforementioned plane and is in engagement with the support part (1) and the frame part (2) at points (1b, 2b) situated in front of the front edge (4b) of the toilet pan (4), but, at least as far as the point of engagement (2b) with the frame part (2) is concerned, behind the aforementioned imaginary axis of rotation (8). The axis of rotation (8) is positioned in such a way that it will lie in the immediate vicinity of the knees of the person using the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Device for facilitating toilet visitsThe present invention relates to an arrangement for facilitating toilet visits essentially for an adult person with impaired mobility, comprising a support part so arranged as to be installed on a toilet pan, in conjunction with which its regular toilet seat must be removed, and a frame part supporting a seat ring and pivotally attached in at least two points with the support part, whereby a straight line, which passes through the aforementioned points, represents an imaginary axis of rotation which forms a line perpendicular to a plane of symmetry through the toilet pan and lies ahead of its front edge, with a device acting between the support part and the frame part for causing the frame part to rotate relative to the support part between an inclined position in which the person in question can support himself with his back against the seat ring and a seated position in which the person can attend to his needs.An arrangement of this kind, which already exists on the market, makes use of two piston and cylinder units positioned on respective sides of the arrangement. The construction obtained in this way is certainly stable, although also expensive, and steps must be taken to ensure that both piston-cylinder units operate entirely synchronously in order for the frame part not to become warped. Also, the imaginary axis of rotation is in a comparatively low position; it lies approximately in the area around the calf of the person using the arrangement. What this means is that, when the person in question is to be helped from a sitting position into a standing position, the seat ring is tipped forwards without the front edge of the seat ring being raised to a sufficient extent at the same time, which means that the seat ring forms a 

 comparatively strongly inclined plane like a slide and can impart a sensation of insecurity to the person in question.The object of the present invention is to make available an arrangement of the kind referred to by way of introduction which does not suffer from the aforementioned disadvantages and which at the same time is of simple construction and can therefore be marketed at a competitive price. This object is met in that the aforementioned device acting between the support part and the frame part lies in the aforementioned plane and is in engagement with the support part and the frame part at points situated in front of the front edge of the toilet pan, but, at least as far as the point of engagement with the frame part is

Patent Claims
1. Arrangement for facilitating toilet visits essentially for an adult person with impaired mobility, comprising a support part (1) so arranged as to be installed on a toilet pan (4), in conjunction with which its regular toilet seat must be removed, and a frame part (2) supporting a seat ring (5) and pivotally attached in at least two points (6, 7) with the support part (1), whereby a straight line (8) , which passes through the aforementioned points (6, 7) , represents an imaginary axis of rotation which forms a line perpendicular to a plane of symmetry through the toilet pan (4) and lies ahead of its front edge (4b), with a device (3) acting between the support part (1) and the frame part (2) for causing the frame part (2) to rotate relative to the support part (1) between an inclined position in which the person in question can support himself with his back against the seat ring and a seated position in which the person can attend to his needs, characterized in that, the aforementioned device (3) acting between the support part (1) and the frame part (2) lies in the aforementioned plane and is in engagement with the support part (1) and the frame part (2) at points (lb, 2b) situated in front of the front edge (4b) of the toilet pan (4), but, at least as far as the point of engagement (2b) with the frame part (2) is concerned, behind the aforementioned imaginary axis of rotation (8) , which is positioned in such a way that it will lie in the immediate vicinity of the knees of the person using the device.
2. Arrangement in accordance with Patent Claim 1, clÎ¹__ra
<
__.eri_re_. in that the support part (1) is so 


 arranged exclusively as to rest against and as to be supported by the rim (4a) of the toilet pan.
3. Arrangement in accordance with any of the preceding Patent Claims, characterized in that the aforementioned device ( 3 ) acting between the support part (1 ) and the frame part (2) comprises an hydraulically or pneumatically operated piston- cylinder unit (3a) which interacts with an electrically or manually operated pump (3b). -
4. Arrangement in accordance with Patent Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the aforementioned device (3) acting between the support part (1) and the frame part (2) consists of a so-called ball-and-nut screw.
