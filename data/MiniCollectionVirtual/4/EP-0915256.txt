<ABSTRACT>
It comprises a flow detector (6) which provides a
pump-stop signal; a pressure detector (5) which has a

moving part associated with a membrane (14) and a fixed
part mounted in the housing (2) of the apparatus (1) in the

position of displacement of the moving part, the flow
detector (6) also being provided with a moving part (9),

which functions as a shutoff valve, and a fixed part
mounted in the housing (2) of the apparatus (1), said fixed

parts being magnetic sensors (12, 13); and means (7) for
urging the pressure detector (5).
It includes means for regulating the hydrostatic
pressure, mounted inside the apparatus (1), thus allowing

the pressure of the supply line to be regulated in function
of the flow of water through the apparatus.
Advantageously, the magnetic sensors (12, 13) are
connected in such a way that if at least one of said

sensors opens the circuit (24a) that supplies signal to the
hydraulic pump (1), then the pump will stop. The apparatus

takes into account a possible failure of the magnetic
sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
controlling the starting and stopping of a hydraulic pump
that permits regulation of the hydrostatic pressure, while
ensuring perfect operation of the hydraulic pump even in
the event of failure of any of the sensors.Known in the art are apparatus for controlling the
starting and stopping of a hydraulic pump that include a
chamber with an inlet and an outlet. A check valve closes
off the outlet and is associated with a sensor, which sends
a signal to a control device when the check valve is open.
The aforesaid apparatus also include another sensor for
capturing the hydraulic pressure inside the apparatus,
which also sends a signal to the control device upon
reaching a certain value. When there is no water flowing
through the circuit the first sensor ceases sending a
signal, leading to stoppage of the apparatus.EP 0219360 B1 describes an apparatus that includes a flow
detector providing, in the absence of flow, the stop down
signal for the pump, and a pressure detector providing, for
a predetermined value of the pressure, the start up signal
for the pump, and impeller means for the pressure detector,
consisting of a hydrosphere membrane upon which the inner
air acts. The pressure detector comprises a movable part
pushed by the membrane and a fixed part arranged in the
apparatus body at the displacement position of the movable
part. The flow detector comprises a part which is movable
and a fixed part which is arranged in the apparatus body.
The fixed parts of the two detectors are Hall effect cells.
The electronic circuit of the apparatus of the above
mentioned patent which supplies signal to the hydraulic
pump, connects the pump and keeps it in operation as long
as the Hall effect cell of the fixed part of the flow
detector cooperate with the magnet of the movable part of
the flow detector. The Hall effect cell and the magnet of
the flow detector constitute a sensor which sends a start
signal to the pump when it is closed.Said apparatus present the disadvantage of taking
account only of incorrect operation of the pump when there
is no water in the circuit, while they take no account of
cases of incorrect operation due to defect, wear or
breakage of the sensors. It is thus possible for the pump
to be operating continuously when it should not be doing
so, without the sensors detecting the situation, and this
can lead to damage of the pump.The aforesaid disadvantage must be considered to
be a major disadvantage, since with the passage of time it
has been
