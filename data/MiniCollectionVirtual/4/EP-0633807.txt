<ABSTRACT>
A separator device for separating solid material from liquid, particularly in sewage, has an outer casing (10) with respective solid material and liquid outlets (15, 14; 44, 46), a drum (20) rotatable within the casing and formed of mesh panels (28) for flow of liquid therethrough, spirals (32) within the drum for moving the solid material within the drum, upon rotation, towards an outlet therefrom positioned above the solid material outlet of the casing, the spirals being each supported at their outer periphery by the periphery of the drum and at their inner periphery by an inlet feed tube (33) and/or a central driven shaft (19) of the drum, and in-line bearings around the shaft (19) and a journal (35) outside respective opposite ends of the casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a separator device for separating solid material 
from liquid. International application No: PCT/SE87/00504 (published as WO 
88/03433) shows a rotatable drum sieve in which a liquids/solids mixture 
is fed to a pipe which is fixed to and extends internally within a rotatably 
driven horizontal drum. The pipe is fixed to the drum by a feed screw, 
and supply openings are provided along the pipe to feed mixture from 
the pipe into a drum space. Liquid drains away through sieve openings 
in the drum, whilst sieved solids material is moved along the drum by 
the feed screw, lifted back into a separated end section of the pipe and 
discharged therefrom by means of a discharge screw. Excess unsieved 
material is fed via a spillway for further sieving. An object of the invention is to provide such a separator device in an 
improved manner. According to the invention a separator for separating solid material from 
liquid comprises a casing, a liquid material outlet from the casing, a solid 
material outlet, the liquid material outlet being separate from the solid 
material outlet, a drum within the casing, the drum having first and 
second ends, an outlet, and an apertured surface for liquid to flow out of 
the drum, an inlet member for the supply of a mixture of said solid 
material and said liquid into the drum, the inlet member being 
concentric with said drum axis and being rotatable with said drum, a 
feed member for the supply of said mixture of said solid material and 
said liquid, the feed member being fixed relative to the inlet member  
 
and concentric therewith, a rotary seal between the inlet member and 
the feed member, a first journal at said first end of the drum, a bearing 
outside of an end of the casing, the first journal being supported by said 
bearing and rotating upon rotation of said drum and inlet member, drive 
means at said second end of the drum for rotatably driving the drum and 
inlet member, spiral means within the drum for moving said solid 
material within the drum towards said outlet therefrom where it passes to 
said solid material outlet, the spiral means having inner and outer 
peripheries and being supported for at least part of its length at the outer 
periphery thereof and for at least part of its length at the inner periphery 
thereof, a second journal at said second end of the drum, and a bearing 
which supports said second journal at said second end of the drum, the 
bearings which receive said first and second journals respectively being 
in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A separator for separating solid material from liquid comprising 
a casing (10), a liquid material outlet (14:46) from the casing, a solid 

material outlet (15:44), the liquid material outlet being separate from the 
solid material outlet, a drum (20) within the casing, the drum having first 

and second ends, an outlet, and an apertured surface for liquid to flow 
out of the drum, an inlet member (33) for the supply of a mixture of said 

solid material and said liquid into the drum, the inlet member being 
concentric with said drum axis and being rotatable with said drum, a 

feed member (42) for the supply of said mixture of said solid material 
and said liquid, the feed member being fixed relative to the inlet 

member and concentric therewith, a rotary seal (39) between the inlet 
member and the feed member, a first journal (35) at said first end of the 

drum, a bearing (38) outside of an end of the casing, the first journal 
being supported by said bearing and rotating upon rotation of said drum 

and inlet member, drive means (22) at said second end of the drum for 
rotatably driving the drum and inlet member, spiral means (32) within 

the drum for moving said solid material within the drum towards said 
outlet therefrom where it passes to said solid material outlet, the spiral 

means having inner and outer peripheries and being supported for at 
least part of its length at the outer periphery thereof and for at least part 

of its length at the inner periphery thereof, a second journal (19) at said 
second end of the drum, and a bearing (18) which supports said second 

journal at said second end of the drum, the bearings (38, 18) which 
receive said first and second journals respectively being in line,
 
characterised in that the outlet from the drum through which solid 

material passes to the solid material outlet (15:44) is at the periphery of 
the drum, in that the solid material outlet (15:44) extends from the casing 

(10) and is fixed relative thereto, in that the drum (20) is rotatable about  
 

an axis at an angle relative to the horizontal, in that one of the first and 
second ends of the drum is closed, in that the first and second journals 

(35, 19) are respectively received in said bearings (38, 18) and supported 
thereby against movement in any radial direction, and in that the inlet 

member extends centrally through the bearing (38) supporting the first 
journal (35). 
A separator according to Claim 1, wherein the drum (20) has a 
drum body member (25), the spiral means (32) comprise at least one spiral or 

part-spiral which is supportingly connected at its outer periphery to said 
drum body member, and the drum also comprises at least one mesh 

panel (28) for outflow of liquid from the drum.
