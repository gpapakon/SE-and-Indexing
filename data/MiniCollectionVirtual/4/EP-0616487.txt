in a cooking chamber. A gas sensor is placed about an exhaust 
port of the oven and senses amount of gas or vapor exhausted 

from the cooking chamber through the exhaust port during a 
thawing operation, and outputs a gas amount signal to a 

microprocessor. The microprocessor calculates a thawing time 
by operation of the output signal of the gas sensor and 

outputting a thawing control signal for driving the microwave 
oven. An output drive unit controls output level of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a microwave
oven and, more particularly, to an automatic thawing device of
the microwave oven and a method for controlling the automatic
thawing operation of the device.A microwave oven is generally provided with an automatic
thawing function for thawing of frozen food. The automatic
thawing operation of the microwave oven is carried out by an
automatic thawing device.With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown in a block
diagram a construction of a typical automatic thawing device
of a microwave oven. The typical thawing device comprises a
turntable 3 which is placed in a cooking chamber 1 of the
microwave oven and rotates with frozen food 2 loaded thereon,
thus to render the food 2 appropriately thawed. A weight
sensor 4 is mounted under the turntable 3 and senses the
weight of the food 2 loaded on the turntable 3. This weight
sensor 4 is connected to a microprocessor 5 and outputs a food 
weight signal to this microprocessor 5. The microprocessor 5
calculates a thawing time, required to thaw the frozen food
2, by operation of the weight signal of the sensor 4 and
outputs a thawing control signal for driving the microwave
oven. This microprocessor 5 is connected to a time display 6
which displays the thawing time thereon in response to the
thawing control signal of the microprocessor 5. An output
drive unit 7 is connected to the microprocessor 5 and outputs
a drive signal in response to the thawing control signal of
the microprocessor 5, thus to drive a magnetron 8 of the oven.
This magnetron 8 generates an electromagnetic wave of high
frequency or a microwave for the thawing time calculated by
the microprocessor 5.In Fig.1, the reference numeral 9 denotes an exhaust port
for exhausting vapor or gas generated from the food 2 in the
cooking chamber 1 to the outside of the oven.Fig. 2 is a flowchart of a method for control of the
thawing operation of the above thawing device.When the frozen food 2 is loaded on the turntable 3 in
the cooking chamber 1 in order to be automatically thawed, the
weight sensor 4 under the turntable 3 senses weight of the
food 2. Upon sensing the food weight, the sensor 4 outputs
the food weight signal to the microprocessor 5 where the
weight signal is operated in order to calculate the thawing
time required to thaw the frozen food 2. The microprocessor 5 in turn outputs the thawing control
signal to both the time display 6 and the output drive unit 7.
Upon reception of the thawing control signal, the time display
6 displays the thawing
