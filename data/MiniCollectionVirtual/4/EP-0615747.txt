<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a hemoglobin-encapsulating
liposome adapted for administration into an
organism. More particularly, this invention relates to a
hemoglobin-encapsulating liposome wherein the hemoglobin
encapsulated would undergo a minimized oxidation with
lapse of time after administration into an organism.Typical blood substitutes in current use include
plasma expanders such as gelatin lysate solutions, dextran
solutions, and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions. Such
blood substitutes, however, are preparations which have
been developed in order to make up for the plasma in blood
vessels and maintain blood circulation dynamics upon
large-volume hemorrhage or other emergent occasions.
Therefore, such blood substitutes are unable to substitute
for oxygen-transportation capacity intrinsic to natural
erythrocytes. Apart from such plasma expanders,
development of artificial oxygen carriers is on its way
for their use as blood substitutes provided with an
oxygen-transportation capacity analogous to that of the 
natural erythrocytes.At the initial stage of such development, chemically
synthesized products making use of a fluorocarbon emulsion
(perfluorochemical, PFC, often referred to as
fluorocarbon) having a high oxygen-dissolving capacity (20
times that of water) were investigated. Such chemically
synthesized products, however, have been found to have
such defects as an insufficient oxygen-transportation
capacity as well as accumulation in the organism.On the other hand, attempts have been made to utilize
hemoglobin from natural erythrocytes for the oxygen
carrier. Use of such free hemoglobin under free
conditions, however, is practically difficult since it
suffers from an extremely short half time (not more than 4
hours) in the living body as well as low oxygen-transportation
capacity to periphery and toxicity to
kidney. Consequently, interests of the development have
shifted to modified hemoglobins (stabilized hemoglobin,
polymerized hemoglobin, etc.) and hemoglobins incorporated
in liposomes, wherein the problems associated with the
free hemoglobin have been obviated.A typical hemoglobin-encapsulating liposome produced
by thin film process is reported by Miller (US Patent No
4,133,874). In this process, the hemoglobin-encapsulating
liposomes are produced by dissolving a liposome-forming
lipid in an adequate organic solvent such as chloroform,
distilling off the organic solvent from the resulting
solution to form a thin film of the lipid, adding a 
hemoglobin solution obtained by hemolysis
