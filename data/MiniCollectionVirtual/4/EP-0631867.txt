<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates preferably to a semishell-shaped gripper for sheet printing machines. The object of the invention is to develop a gripper of low weight which is attached without play on the gripper shaft and minimises the slip of the gripper tip on the printing carrier. This is achieved in that the gripper finger (2) which surrounds the gripper shaft (1) in a sector of a circle has congruent cutouts (11) in its side walls (17) in such a way that separate active surfaces (8, 9) are formed at its ends. The active surfaces (8, 9) are assigned to the gripper shaft (1) with frictional engagement and, in conjunction with the resulting force, form a triangle of forces. The gripper holder (4) has on its upper side a depression (12) extending parallel to the gripper shaft (1) and, with the lower edge of a web (16) connecting the side walls (17), forms a releasably positive-locking connection between the gripper holder (4) and the gripper finger (2). The gripper tip (3) has a raised holding surface (15) which has radii (R) which run out at its circumference.

Gripper for a sheet printing press with a gripper 
finger (2) releasably arranged surrounding the 

gripper shaft (1) in a circular sector in the shape 
of a box open outwardly turned away from the gripper 

shaft (1) having a floor and a central aperture, to 
which is arranged a gripper mounting (4) releasably 

connected with the driven gripper shaft (1) via the 
aperture of the gripper finger (2), using a 

compression spring (5) arranged between gripper 
shaft (1) and gripper support (6) and an oppositely 

lying adjustment element (13), characterised in that 
the gripper finger (2) arranged on the gripper shaft 

(1) in the peripheral direction in the floor of its 
side walls (17) has congruent apertures (11) and at 

its free ends of the floor separate working surfaces 
(8, 9) which are arranged frictionally locked to the 

gripper shaft (1), wherein the forces resulting 
directed through the gripper shaft centre point 

which 

with closed gripper (P
S
) are formed by the 
holding force at the gripper support (6) and 

the spring force of the compression spring (5) 
and 
with opened gripper (P
A
) by the spring force of 

the compression spring (5) and the stop force 
against the adjustment element (13) lie closely 

adjacent one another on the periphery of the 
gripper shaft (1) in quadrant I, 
 
that furthermore the gripper mounting (4) on the 

upper side has a depression (12) running parallel to 
the gripper shaft (1) and is releasably connected in 

positively interlocked fashion with the lower edge 
of a bar (16) of the gripper finger (2) connecting 

the side walls (17), as well as a gripper tip (3) 
being arranged on the gripper finger (2) which has a  

 
raised holding surface (15) which, at the periphery, 

has radii (R) running out towards the gripper tip 
(3). 
Gripper according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the working surfaces (8, 9) have integral lubricant 

supply for reducing moving friction. 
Gripper according to Claim 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the working surfaces (8, 9) have inlaid sliding 

bearing material. 
Gripper according to Claim 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the gripper tip (3) and the gripper finger (2) 

constitute a unitary component. 
Gripper according to Claim 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the radius (R) of the holding surface (15) runs 

in the direction of the undercut (14). 
Gripper according to Claim 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the radius (R) of the holding surface (15) has 

a range of 0.6 to 1.6 mm.
