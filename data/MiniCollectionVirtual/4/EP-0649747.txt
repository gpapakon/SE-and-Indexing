present invention comprises a velocity detecting portion 

for detecting the velocity of a printing wire, a comparator 
output signal generating portion for generating a first 

comparator output signal CMP and a second comparator output 
signal CMPR corresponding to the detected velocity, a first 

counter 101 for measuring a motion time T
S
 for the printing 
wire, a second counter 102 for measuring a print time T

for the printing wire, and a third counter 103 for 

measuring a return time T

 for the printing wire. When the 
signal level of the first comparator output signal CMP is 

repeatedly changed between a high level and a low level, 
the first counter 101 stops counting. Even if an armature 

is rebounded, the first counter 101 does not resume 
counting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wire dot impact
printer apparatus, in particular, a wire motion detecting
apparatus for a wire dot head.In a wire dot impact printer apparatus, a wire dot
head is disposed opposite to a platen through an ink ribbon
and a printing medium. A printing wire is banged on the
printing medium through the ink ribbon.
Such prior art printer apparatus is, for example, disclosed in
the JP-A-6-99640.With a wire motion detecting apparatus that detects
the motion of the printing wire dot head, the wire dot
impact printer apparatus prints data on various printing
mediums. In reality, in the printer apparatus, the
thickness of a printing medium for use (or the number of
copy papers) is detected by the wire motion detecting
apparatus and a sensor circuit of a print time detecting
portion. When the thickness of the printing paper is
changed, the distance between the forward edge of the wire
dot head and the printing medium (this distance is referred 
to as head gap) is optimally adjusted.However, in the wire motion detecting apparatus for
the conventional wire dot head, if a velocity wave form V1
is abnormal or if a sensor failure takes place, a motion
time TS, a print time TP, and a return time TR cannot be
precisely measured. A similar apparatus is further disclosed in
EP-A-0 539 210.An object of the present invention is to solve the
above-mentioned problem of a wire motion detecting
apparatus for a wire dot head according to the related art
reference and to provide both a wire motion detecting
apparatus for a wire dot head that can precisely obtain a
motion time, a print time, and a return time upon
occurrences of an abnormal velocity wave form or a sensor
failure and a wire dot impact printer apparatus for use
with the wire motion detecting apparatus for the wire dot
head.A first aspect of the present invention is a wire
motion detecting apparatus for a wire dot head, comprising
a first counter for inputting a printing trigger signal and
a first comparator output signal that is obtained by
comparing a velocity wave form of the printing wire of the
printer head with a first reference voltage and for
measuring a motion time of a printing wire corresponding to
the printing trigger signal and the first comparator output
signal, a second counter for measuring a print time of the
printing wire corresponding to the first comparator output 
signal, a third counter for measuring a return time of the
printing wire corresponding to the first comparator output
signal and a second comparator
