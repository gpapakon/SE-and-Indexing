<ABSTRACT>
A hot water dispensing device which includes a flexible tube 
or a 

bellows (31) which can be depressed by a solenoid (61) 
such that hot water can pass 

into the tube or bellows (31) and out an outlet (24) when the solenoid 
is energized. 

When the solenoid (61) is de-energized, the upper portion of the 
tube or bellows (31) 

forms a seal to prevent water overflowing if the machine is 
moved or is jolted. 

By varying the time of energization of the solenoid (61), the quantity 
of water can be 

adjusted. Another modification has a pivoted tube controlled 
by a solenoid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to liquid dispensers and in 
particular to a hot water dispenser that can be used, for example, in a 
coffee brewing machine or other device. In hot water dispensing mechanisms of the prior art, a solenoid 
valve has controlled the flow of hot water. However, it is difficult to precisely 
control the quantity of hot water with such prior art devices. See U. S. 
patents 3,311,266; 3,216,623 and 3,179,035. The present invention relates to means for moving the end of a tube 
below the level of water in a container so that a quantity of water will be 
delivered through the tube. The input end of the tube may engage a seal 
when water is not being delivered so as to prevent accidental discharge. 
The input end of the tube may be moved vertically below the water level to 
allow discharge or the tube may be rotated so as to cause the input end of 
the tube to be moved below the level of the water. The level of the water 
in the tank may be maintained at a constant level by a float valve and the 
input end of the tube can be moved by a solenoid below the water level for 
a fixed time so as to deliver a fixed quantity of water. The tube may be 
flexible so that it will flex so that its input end can be moved below the 
surface of the water. The tube may also be rigid and formed with a bend 
so that it can be rotated or pivoted so as to move the input end of the pipe 
below the water's surface.  The present invention comprises a bellows tube which is mounted 
in a container of hot water and which is coupled to a solenoid which when 
energized depresses the top of the bellows tube below the level of the hot 
water such that the hot water can pass through openings in the top of the 
tube through an outlet for dispensing. The time that the solenoid is 
energized controls the time that the top of the bellows tube is below the 
water level and thus controls the quantity of hot water which is dispensed. 
When the solenoid is de-energized, the top of the tube engages a plate 
which seals it so that hot water will not be discharged from the tube when 
the unit is moved or jostled because the top of the discharge tube is sealed. By varying the time of energization of the solenoid, the quantity of 
hot water dispensed can be adjusted. A float valve or other control device 
maintains the level of hot water in the container at a constant level. A 
heater allows the temperature of the hot water to be controlled. The invention provides a simple and accurate hot water dispenser 
which can be

Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer comprising, 
a container means with liquid therein, a supply tube with an outlet end and an 

input end, an actuating means connected to said supply tube so as to move 
said input end from a first position above the level of the liquid in said container 

means to a second position where said input end is below the level of the liquid 
in said container means so as to deliver liquid from said outlet end. 
Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer according to 
claim 1 wherein said actuating means includes a timing means for holding said 

input end below the level of the liquid for a pre-determined time. 
Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer according to 
claim 1 wherein said supply tube is flexible. 
Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer according to 
claim 1 including means for maintaining the level of the liquid substantially 

constant. 
Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer according to 
claim 1 including a heater means for heating the liquid in the container means. 
Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer according to 
claim 1 including means for sealing the input end of the supply tube when it is 

in the first position. 
Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer according to 
claim 2 wherein said actuating means is a solenoid or motor operated device 

coupled to said input end of said supply tube so as to move it from the first to 
second position when the solenoid is energized. 
Means for dispensing liquid for a beverage brewer according to 
claim 7 wherein said supply tube is formed with first and second portions which 

are pivotally connected together and said input end formed in said first portion 
and said outlet end formed in said second portion. 
A liquid dispenser comprising, a container which contains liquid 
that is maintained at a substantially constant level and an opening formed in 

said container below the level of said liquid, a compressible bellows tube 
mounted in said container and with its lower end attached to said container 

about said opening, and means for depressing the upper end of said 
compressible bellows below the level of said liquid for a selectable time to 

dispense liquid through said compressible bellows. 
A liquid dispenser according to claim 9, wherein the upper end 
of said compressible bellows engages a top wall of said container when said 

means for depressing the upper end of said bellows is not energized so as to 
seal the upper end of said bellows to prevent liquid from passing from the 

container through said bellows. 
A liquid dispenser according to claim 10 including a dispensing 
member connected to the upper end of said bellows and formed with a 

shoulder which engages the top wall of said container when said means for 

depressing the upper end of said bellows is not energized. 
A liquid dispenser according to claim 11 wherein said means 
for depressing the upper end of said compressible bellows comprises a 

solenoid or motor operated device which has an armature connected to said 
dispensing member so as to depress the upper end of said bellows. 
A liquid dispenser according to claim 12 wherein said armature 
is connected to said dispensing member by a shaft which is connected to said 

dispensing member and which is driven by said solenoid.
