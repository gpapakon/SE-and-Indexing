<ABSTRACT>
An anti-counterfeit security device for documents in 
general in the form of a tape-like or filament-like 

supporting element (1) made of polyester. On the tape or 
filament, a first security element (2;2a,2b,2c) is provided 

which can be detected by devices and is constituted by 
regions made of a material which can be detected by 

magnetoresistors and are arranged in succession to generate 
a signal that can be decoded by the magnetoresistors, and a 

second security element (10;30) is also provided, visually 
detectable in transmitted light, which is constituted by 

portions of the regions that are free from the 
magnetoresistor-detectable material in order to form 

graphic markings optically perceivable in transmitted 
light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-counterfeit security device for documents in general.As is known, security devices are currently inserted in many documents, such as for example bank notes; these devices are constituted by filaments with such characteristics as to increase the difficulties in reproducing these documents.Among known security devices, mention is made of the one disclosed in European Patent No. 310,707, which in practice consists in depositing, on a support made of flexible and impermeable material, such as for example a polyester tape, regions of magnetic material, such as iron oxide, which either due to their different thickness or due to their different deposition area have, when passing beneath a magnetic head, a signal/flux directly correlated to the amount of oxide, taking into account that the filament is generally manufactured with a constant width.It is customary to subsequently cover these regions of magnetic material with inks that are highly opaque to transmitted light, so that it is optically impossible to detect the presence and arrangement of the regions of magnetic material.This document, viewed in reflected light, has a barely perceptible line at the filament or tape, whereas in transmitted light it is fully opaque along the same line.These regions of magnetic material are magnetized by means of a permanent magnet which in practice charges the iron oxide so that it maintains the magnetic flux in order to be a signal-emitting element. The signals are detected by magnetic heads which, by means of appropriate electronic devices and associated programs, allow to form a decodable code, according to the thickness, density, position and/or succession of the magnetic regions.In order to detect the magnetic flux of the regions composed using iron oxide, these regions must be moving beneath the magnetic head; this movement increases the signal as a function of the speed in a substantially proportional manner.With this type of solution, it is not possible to detect the signal emitted by the iron oxide regions with magnetic heads if there is no relative motion between the magnetic regions and the heads.With this kind of security element, a counterfeiter can in practice detect only its presence but is unable to detect its arrangement.However, this security device is detectable only by means of specifically dedicated devices, and in practice cannot be detected visually, since, as mentioned above, visually it is only possible to identify the presence of a filament, without
