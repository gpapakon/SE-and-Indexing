<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for use as a catheter guidewire and a method for making a 
catheter guidewire. The apparatus comprises an elongate non-coiled wire 

having a proximal portion (11), a distal tip (12) and a flexible portion (13) 
located between the proximal portion and the distal tip having axially spaced 

grooves (14) cut therein. The method for making the guidewire includes 
burnishing one end of a wire to create a rounded distal tip and cutting a 

predetermined pattern of axially spaced grooves in a length of wire adjacent 
to the distal tip to create a flexible portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catheter guidewire 
and, more particularly, to a guidewire with a flexible tip 
that is made as a single part. Catheters are often used for diagnostic or therapeutic 
procedures that require the insertion of a catheter into 
the circulatory system to reach a predetermined site such 
as an artery near the heart. The catheter is positioned at 
the desired site by alternately advancing a guidewire ahead 
of the catheter from a body access site, through the 
circulatory system until reaching the desired site. The 
path that the guidewire and catheter must follow is 
tortuous. The catheter and guidewire must be quite flexible in 
order to follow the tortuous path to the desired site. 
However, because these guidewires are advanced through the 
circulatory system by applying a torque to the proximal end 
of the guidewire which is located at an external site, the 
guidewire must have sufficient column strength to allow the 
distal end of the guidewire to be manipulated from the 
external access site, which can be more than 150 
centimeters from the distal end. Current catheter guidewire designs attempt to meet 
these requirements by incorporating a tapered distal end 
region to increase the flexibility of the guidewire's 
distal end. Unfortunately, this reduces the column 
strength of the distal end. To remedy this problem, a wire 
coil is brazed or soldered onto the tapered section of the 
wire to increase the column strength of the tapered wire  
 
section without losing the flexibility. Guidewires of this 
type are disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 4,538,622, 
4,545,390, 4,582,181 and 4,846,186. Unfortunately, this type of guidewire construction 
requires many manufacturing steps including the tapering of 
the guidewire, the forming of the wire coil, cutting the 
coil to the desired length and fastening the coil to the 
distal end section of the guidewire. This method of 
construction is not only time consuming and costly to 
manufacture, but it also presents the danger of having the 
coil separate from the wire while it is in the patient. One attempt to eliminate the drawbacks of the current 
designs was to enclose the tapered distal end section in a 
polymer sleeve as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,095,915. 
The addition of the polymeric sleeve is used to increase 
column strength of the tapered distal end of the catheter 
guidewire without using a coil. Axially spaced grooves are 
then cut into the polymeric sleeve to increase the bending 
flexibility of the
