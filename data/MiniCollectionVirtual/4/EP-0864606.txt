<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a rubber composition
comprising 100 parts by weight of a diene rubber

component, 10 to 200 parts by weight of a reinforcing
agent, and 0.1 to 15 parts by weight of a fatty acid

salt. For example, the diene rubber preferably comprises
a diene rubber having a heteroatom-containing

polar group, the reinforcing agent preferably comprises
carbon black or silica, and the fatty acid salt preferably

comprises a metal salt of a C
1
 to C
36
 fatty acid.
This rubber composition yields a vulcanized rubber

showing improvements in heat build-up, tensile strength,
abrasion resistance and processability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rubber compositions
which yield vulcanized rubbers showing improvements in
heat build-up, tensile strength, abrasion resistance and
processability.In recent years, as growing importance is
attached to resource saving and environmental protection,
the demand for a reduction in the fuel consumption
of automobiles has become increasingly stronger. Also
for automobile tires, it is desired to reduce their
rolling resistance and thereby contribute to a reduction
in fuel consumption. In order to reduce the rolling
resistance of tires, it is common practice to use, as
the rubber material for tires, a rubber material which
can yield a vulcanized rubber showing a low degree of
heat build-up.Conventionally, it has been proposed to reduce
heat build-up by using, as the rubber material for
tires, a rubber composition comprising a diene rubber
into which, in place of carbon black, silica is incorporated
as a reinforcing agent. However, as compared with
carbon black-filled rubber compositions, such silica-filled
rubber compositions have the disadvantage that
they fail to achieve sufficient abrasion resistance and
tensile strength. One of the causes therefor is believed
to be that silica has a lower affinity for diene
rubbers than carbon black and hence fails to exhibit a
sufficient reinforcing effect.Conventionally, a method for enhancing the
affinity of silica for diene rubbers by using a silane 
coupling agent has been proposed (Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 252431/'91, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
252433/'91, etc.). However, in order to achieve a
satisfactory effect, this method requires the use of a
large amount of an expensive silane coupling agent.As another improvement, the use of a diene
rubber into which a substituent group having an affinity
for silica has been introduced is being investigated.
For example, diene rubbers having a tertiary amino group
introduced thereinto (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
101344/'89) have been proposed for diene rubbers formed
by emulsion polymerization; and diene rubbers having
introduced thereinto an alkylsilyl group (Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 188501/'89), a halogenated silyl
group (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 230286/'93) or a
substituted amino group (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
22940/'89) have been proposed for diene rubbers formed
by anionic polymerization.However, most of the diene rubbers having the
aforesaid substituent groups introduced thereinto show
poor processability because, when they are mixed with
silica, they cohere strongly
