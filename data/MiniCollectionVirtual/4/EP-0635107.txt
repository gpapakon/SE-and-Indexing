<ABSTRACT>
A sprag clutch having inner and outer concentric races (1, 2) with sprags (3) pivotally located between the races (1, 2). A circumferential garter spring (6) locates over the sprags (3) to bias them to a wedging position. Relative rotation of the races (1, 2) in one direction causes a centrifugal force (CF) to act on each sprag (3) to pivot it away from contact with the outer race (2). The centre of gravity (G) of each sprag (3) is located radially inwards of its centre of rotation (C) such that when the sprag (3) pivots the centrifugal couple (CF) increases to overcome the increased tension couple (SF) of the garter spring to allow a snap action lift off of each sprag (3). The snap action substantially reduces the contact time between the sprags (3) and the outer race (2) and hence wear is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sprag clutches comprising an inner race and an outer 
race and sprags located between the races. This invention is particularly concerned with centrifugal lift off sprag clutches which 
are well known in the art. Sprag clutches which use a centrifugal lift off action to effect lift off of the sprags from 
the outer race are known. The sprags are biased into engagement with both races to effect a 
wedging action preventing rotation of the races relative to each other in a first direction. 
Relative rotation of the races in a second direction (overrunning) is permitted. At a certain 
relative angular velocity in the second direction the centrifugal force acting on the sprags, due 
to the unbalanced mass created by the asymmetric geometry, increases to a magnitude which 
causes the sprags to pivot about an axis such that a clearance develops between the sprags and 
the outer raceway. The advantage of centrifugal lift off clutches is that the wear of the sprags against the 
contacting race is reduced during overrunning. However, as the sprags pivot to lift off a race the 
bias force urging the sprags into the locked position tends to increase. This results in an 
extended lift off time over a range of angular velocity during which the centrifugal force 
overcomes the increasing resilient bias force and hence a degree of wear still occurs. US-A-5046037 describes a one-way acting sprag clutch in which sprags 
automatically disengage from an outer raceway at a predetermined rotative speed of an inner 
raceway. Each sprag has asymmetric rocker lip portions creating an unbalanced mass. The 
unbalanced mass causes increased tilting movements of the sprags overcoming a biasing 
spring force at the predetermined rotative speed of the inner raceway. Each sprag has knife-edge 
shoulders which move radially outwardly to bear against a rim of a supporting cage and 
about which the sprag tilts during lift-off from the outer race. It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the aforesaid disadvantage. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a sprag clutch comprising a 
race, a plurality of sprags held pivotally in a cage concentric with said race, said sprags having a 
race engaging surface, and resilient means urging said sprags into contact with said race by 
imparting an urging couple to said sprags at a point of action  
 
whereby on attempted rotation of said cage in a first direction relative to said race said sprags 
move to an engaging

<CLAIMS>
A sprag clutch comprising a race (2), a plurality of sprags (3) held pivotally in a cage 
concentric with said race, said sprags (3) having a race engaging surface (5), and resilient 

means (7) urging said sprags into contact with said race (2) by imparting an urging couple to 
said sprags (3) at a point of action whereby on attempted rotation of said cage in a first direction 

relative to said race (2) said sprags (3) move to an engaging position to prevent said rotation, and on 
an attempted rotation of said cage and sprags (3) in a second direction relative to said race (2) a 

centrifugal force acts on each of the sprags (3) imparting a centrifugal couple (CF) to pivot it to 
a disengaged position to allow rotation of said cage and sprags (3), the centre of gravity (G) of 

each sprag (3) being so disposed that as each sprag (3) pivots the centrifugal couple (CF) 
increases at a greater rate than the urging couple (SF), characterised in that the centre of gravity 

(G) of each sprag (3) is disposed radially inwardly of a fixed pivot centre (C) of the sprag (3) so 
that the perpendicular distance of the centre of gravity (G) from the pivot centre (C) increases 

during the pivoting of each sprag (3) causing corresponding increase in the centrifugal couple 
(CF), and the perpendicular distance of the point of action (S) of said resilient means (7) from 

the pivot centre (C) decreases during said pivoting. 
A sprag clutch according to claim 1, comprising inner and outer races (1, 2) between 
which the sprag (3) and the cage are disposed, wherein in said engaged position the sprags (3) 

are in contact with both said inner and outer races (1, 2) and in said disengaged position the 
sprags (3) pivot out of contact with one of said races (1, 2). 
A sprag clutch according to any preceding claim wherein the resilient means (7) is a 
garter spring disposed circumferentially around the sprags (3) and located in a recess (6) in each 

sprag (3). 
A sprag clutch according to claim 3 wherein the garter spring (7) is a tension spring 
which acts in the recess (6) disposed radially outward of the pivot centre (C) of the sprag (3). 
A sprag clutch according to any one of claims 3 to 5 wherein the sprags (3) pivot out of 
contact with said outer race (2).
