<ABSTRACT>
A preferred embodiment of this invention comprises a conductive lightly 
donor doped perovskite layer (e.g. lightly La doped BST 
34
), and a high-dielectric-constant 
material layer (e.g. undoped BST 
36
) overlaying the 
conductive lightly donor doped perovskite layer. The conductive lightly 

donor doped perovskite layer provides a substantially chemically and 
structurally stable electrical connection to the high-dielectric-constant 

material layer. A lightly donor doped perovskite generally has much less 
resistance than undoped, acceptor doped, or heavily donor doped HDC 

materials. The amount of donor doping to make the material conductive (or 
resistive) is normally dependent on the process conditions (e.g. temperature, 

atmosphere, grain size, film thickness and composition). This resistivity may 
be further decreased if the perovskite is exposed to reducing conditio
ns. The 
lightly donor doped perovskite can be deposited and etched by effectively the 

same techniques that are developed for the high-dielectric-constant material. 
The same equipment may used to deposit and etch both the perovskite 

electrode and the dielectric. These structures may also be used for multilayer 
capacitors and other thin-film ferroelectric devices such as pyroelectric 

materials, non-volatile memories, thin-film piezoelectric and thin-film 
electro-optic oxides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to improving electrical connections to 
materials with high-dielectric-constants, such as in the construction of 
capacitors. Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is 
described in connection with current methods of forming electrical 
connections to high-dielectric-constant materials, as an example. The increasing density of integrated circuits (e.g. DRAMs) is 
increasing the need for materials with high-dielectric-constants to be used in 
electrical devices such as capacitors. The current method generally utilized 
to achieve higher capacitance per unit area is to increase the surface 
area/unit area by increasing the topography, such as in trench and stack 
capacitors using SiO2 or SiO2/Si3N4 as the dielectric. This approach becomes 
very difficult in terms of manufacturability for devices such as the 256 Mbit 
and 1 Gbit DRAMs. An alternative approach is to use a high permittivity dielectric 
material. Many perovskite, ferroelectric, or high-dielectric-constant 
(hereafter abbreviated HDC) materials such as (Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST) usually 
have much larger capacitance densities than standard SiO2-Si3N4-SiO2 
capacitors. Various metals and metallic compounds, and typically noble 
metals such as Pt and conductive oxides such as RuO2, have been proposed 
as the electrodes for these HDC materials. To be useful in electronic devices, 
however, reliable electrical connections should generally be constructed 
which do not diminish the beneficial properties of these high-dielectric-constant 
materials. The use of a perovskite conductor as an electrode contacting a layer of a high dielectric constant is generally known from US-A-5 155 658. As used herein the term high-dielectric-constant means a dielectric  
 
constant greater than about 150. The deposition of an HDC material usually 
occurs at high temperature (generally greater than about 500Â°C) in an 
oxygen containing atmosphere. The lower electrode structure should be 
stable during this deposition, and both the lower and upper electrode 
structures should be stable after this deposition. There are several problems 
with the materials thus far chosen for the lower electrode in thin-film 
(generally less than 5 um) applications; many of these problems are related 
to semiconductor process integration. For example, Ru is generally not a 
standard integrated circuit manufacturing material, and it is also relatively 
toxic. Pt has several problems as a lower electrode which hinder it being 
used alone. Pt
