<ABSTRACT>
An address generator capable of generating address data 
for sequentially accessing a memory from a selected memory 

location has a first dip switch for manually setting first 
reference address data and a second dip switch for manually 

setting second reference address data, a first counter for 
loading the first reference address data from the first dip 

switch, and in synchronization with a first clock pulse, 
producing lower M-bit address data, a second counter 20 for 

loading the second reference address data from the second dip 
switch, and in synchronization with a second clock pulse, 

producing higher M-bit address data, an AND gate for 
generating a second clock pulse, and a control unit for 

generating a first and a second control signals, wherein the 
first control signal is applied to the first and the second 

counters and the second control signal is applied to the AND 
gate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
generating address data; and, more particularly, to an 
apparatus for use in a test pattern generator, which is 
capable of generating address data for sequentially accessing 
a memory from an arbitrarily selected memory location. Heretofore, various test pattern generators have been 
used to generate test patterns for diagnosing a semiconductor 
integrated circuit(IC). A test pattern generator forms a part 
of an IC tester for testing semiconductor ICs and generates 
test patterns, each of the test patterns comprising test data 
to be applied to an IC being tested and a reference value for 
comparison with the output data from the IC tested. Typically, the test pattern generator includes a memory 
for storing a plurality of test patterns and an address 
generator which generates address data for sequentially 
accessing the test patterns stored in the memory. A conventional address generator, however, lacks the 
ability to generate address data having the flexibility of 
selectively accessing a certain portion of the test patterns  
 
stored in the memory. It is, therefore, a primary object of the present 
invention to provide an apparatus which is capable of 
generating address data for sequentially accessing a memory 
from an arbitrarily selected memory location. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided an apparatus for generating address data to 
sequentially access a memory from an arbitrarily selected 
memory location, the address data having lower address and 
higher address data, which comprises: a first means for 
manually setting first reference address data; a first 
counting means for loading the first reference address data as 
a first initial count in response to a first control signal, 
incrementing the first initial count by 1 and simultaneously 
providing the incremented count to the memory as the lower 
address data, and generating a carry signal when the 
incremented count reaches a predeterimined value; a second 
means for manually setting second reference address data; a 
second counting means for loading the second reference address 
data as a second initial count in response to the first 
control signal and incrementing the second initial count by 1 
in response to the carry signal and simultaneously providing 
the incremented count to the memory as the higher address  
 
data; a coupling means for, in response to a second control 
signal, coupling the carry signal to the second counting 
means; and a control
