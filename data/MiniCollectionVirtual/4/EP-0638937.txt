is an ohmic electrode in which an n⁺⁺-type regrown GaAs 

layer (32) regrown from the n⁺-type GaAs substrate (31) and a 
NiGe film (33) containing precipitates (34) composed of α'-AuGa 

are sequentially stacked. The ohmic electrode may be 
fabricated by sequentially stacking a Ni film, Au film 

and Ge film on the n⁺-type GaAs substrate, then 
patterning these films by, for example, lift-off, and 

thereafter annealing the structure at a temperature of 
400∼750°C for several seconds to several minutes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ohmic electrode,
its fabricating method and a semiconductor device, and
more particularly to an ohmic electrode for a III-V
compound semiconductor, its fabricating method, and a
semiconductor device using the ohmic electrode.From the viewpoint of improving the
performance and reliability of a device such as FET
using a compound semiconductor, reducing the contact
resistance of its ohmic electrode and improving its
thermal stability are of a great importance. However,
with regards those for compound semiconductors,
particularly, III-V compound semiconductors such as
GaAs semiconductors, there have been none that satisfy
the above-indicated requirements.Ohmic electrodes for GaAs semiconductors
which have been put in practical use or proposed can
generally be classified into the following three types.
In ohmic electrodes of the first type, an ohmic metal
used includes an element behaving as a donor impurity
for GaAs semiconductors. By annealing, the element is
diffused in the semiconductor and makes an n-type
region having a high impurity concentration along the
interface between the electrode metal and the
semiconductor such that an ohmic contact is established 
due to a tunneling effect or the like. In ohmic
electrodes of the second type, an ohmic electrode used
includes an element forming an intermediate layer of a
low energy barrier. By annealing, the element makes an
intermediate layer of a lower energy barrier between
the electrode metal and the semiconductor such that an
ohmic contact is established by lowering the energy
barrier in the region where carriers move. In ohmic
electrodes of the third type, an ohmic electrode used
includes an element reacting with GaAs semiconductors
when annealed and making a regrown semiconductor layer
and an element behaving as a donor impurity for GaAs
semiconductors. By annealing, such a regrown layer is
formed and changed into an n-type having a high
impurity concentration such that an ohmic contact is
established due to a tunnelling effect or the like.A typical example of ohmic electrodes of the
first type is shown in Figs. 1A and 1B. In this
example, a AuGe/Ni film 2 as an ohmic metal is formed
on an n+-type GaAs substrate 1 as shown in Fig. 1A.
Then, it is annealed at 400~500°C to make the ohmic
electrode as shown in Fig. 1B. In Fig. 1B, reference
numeral 3 denotes an n++-type GaAs layer, and 4 denotes
a layer including NiAs and β-AuGa.The ohmic electrode shown in Fig. 1B,
however, has a bad thermal stability. That is, in this
case,
