<ABSTRACT>
Disc brake (10) for textile yarns (11), with a vertical hollow disc shaft (13) which supports two brake discs (14, 26) and which is mounted pivotally adjustably in a bearing plate (36) which is fastened to a brake carrier (12) and which surrounds the disc shaft (13) on the outside above the brake carrier (12) and below the upper brake disc (14). In order to improve a disc brake (10) having the features mentioned in the introduction, in such a way that soiling and particularly internal soiling is avoided, it is designed so that the disc shaft (13) and the bearing plate (36) has or have at least one air channel (50) which, on the one hand, is connected to a compressed-air source and, on the other hand, opens out at fibre-dust collecting points (51) in the region of the lower disc (26).

Disc brake (10) for textile yarns (11), having a
vertical hollow disc axis (13) which supports two brake

discs (14, 26) and is mounted in a swivellingly
displaceable manner in a bearing plate (36) attached to a

brake support (12), which bearing plate surrounds the disc
axis (13) on the outside above the brake support (12) and

below the upper brake disc (14), characterised in that the
disc axis (13) and bearing plate (36) comprises or comprise

at least one air duct (50) which on the one hand is
attached to a source of compressed air and on the other

hand issues at fibre dust collecting points (51) in the
region of the lower disc (26).
Disc brake according to claim 1, characterised in that
the air duct (50) is a sealed annular groove (52) on the

disc axis (13), which comprises vertical outlet openings
(53) issuing directly below the lower disc (26).
Disc brake according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the under side (54) of the lower disc (26) and the

hollow space (55) of the disc axis (13) are connected to
each other with respect to the flow of air.
Disc brake according to one or several of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that a porous ring (28) supporting the

lower disc (26) in a yielding manner has compressed air
blowing through it from the outlet openings (53) of the air

duct (50).
Disc brake according to one or several of claims 1 to
4, characterised in that the annular groove (52) is

adjoined by radial blowing openings (56) issuing outside
the ring (28), which supports the lower disc (26), between 

this ring and the bearing plate (36).
Disc brake according to one or several of claims 1 to
5, characterised in that in the bearing plate (36) the air

duct (50) has radial air inlet slits (57) for bringing air
into the annular groove (52).
Disc brake according to claim 6, characterised in that
the air inlet slits (57) are connected to blowing bores

(58) which blow outside the ring (28), supporting the lower
disc (26), between this ring and the bearing plate (36).
Disc brake according to one or several of claims 1 to
7, characterised in that in the bearing plate (36) the air

duct (50) comprises an annular duct (59) for distributing
compressed air to blow air at the lower disc (26).
Disc brake according to claim 8, characterised in that
the annular duct (59) of the bearing plate (36) is

connected to the annular groove (52) of the disc axis (13)
by means of the air inlet slits (57).
Disc brake according to one or several of claims 1 to
9, characterised in that in a horizontal brake support (12)

intended for further disc brakes (10) an air supply line
(60) is disposed which comprises vertical connection bores

(66) to the annular ducts (59) of the bearing plate (36) of
the disc brakes (10).
Disc brake according to claim 10, characterised in
that a further parallel-disposed air supply line (61) is

allocated to the air supply line (60) and is connected to
the first air supply line (60) and/or is provided with

elastic blowing tubes (62) which each blow air at a disc
brake (10') of a lower spool level. 
Disc brake according to claim 10 or 11, characterised
in that the air supply line (60, 61) is fed at one end

and/or in the region of zone junctions of the spool frame.
