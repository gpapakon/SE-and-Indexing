<ABSTRACT>
The trailing hose system comprises a spreading boom (2) with a number of trailing 
hoses (4), which by means of hoses (5) are connected to a cutting distributor (6). 

The cutting distributor (6) comprises at least one circular cutter plate (7) with a 
number of outlet holes (8) along its periphery for connection of hoses (5) and a 

belonging cylindrically shaped cutter ring (10), whose thickness is less than the diameter 
of an outlet hole (8), and which has a plane under side (11), which comes to 

rest against a plane upper side (12) of the cutter plate (7). The cutter ring (10) is 
held pressed against the cutter plate (7) by a piston (13), which on the upper side is 

actuated by a spring force (21). Over the piston (13) and a plate (24), which are 
mutually meshing loosely along the edge, the cutter ring (10) is coupled to an excentric 

(27) on a shaft (28), which is driven by a motor (29). By the excentrical movement 
of the cutter ring (10) each of the holes (8) all round are opened and closed for 

each revolution of the excentric (27). The parts are so built into a housing that liquid 
manure is delivered to an area outside the cutter ring (10) and air to an area inside 

the cutter ring. Thereby the hoses (5) are under atmospheric pressure at the upper 
end. The cutting distributor (6) is mounted at such a height that the liquid manure 

drains itself out of the system by free fall, and it is oriented so that the holes (8) face 
the end of the boom (2), when the latter is swung out. The trailing hose system is 

floatingly suspensed by means of two sets of rods (36,37) - fig. 7 and 8 - which are 
placed at a distance from each other, and two hydraulic cylinders (41), which can 

raise and lower the trailing hose system, and whose pressure sides are mutually 
connected. Thereby the system i held in an approximately horizontal position irrespective 

of roughnesses in the terrain. At the lowest end of each trailing hose (4) is 
inserted a steel rod (45) which prevents the hose from breaking on contact with the 

ground. 
It is achieved that straw in the liquid manure is effectively shredded, whereby clogging 
up of the hoses is avoided. This prevents the hoses from breaking, gives a 

minimum of resistance in the system is minimal, and a maximum of efflux of liquid 
manure is achieved in an even flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a trailing hose system of the kind described in
the introductory part of claim 1.Such a trailing hose system is known from GB-A-2 251 166.It is a drawback in the said known system that the flow of liquid manure out into the
trailing hoses is pulsating, and uneven and that there is a great loss of pressure in
the system. The individual connecting hoses between the cutting distributor and
the trailing hoses have to be bent in order to be connected to the cutting distributor,
which results in a heavy wear on the hoses each time the booms are swung up
alongside the liquid manure tank vehicle and back again. Furthermore, the knife
function in the cutting distributor is insufficient, wherefore the system easily clogs
up with bits of straw which are present in the liquid manure.It is the purpose of the present invention to define a trailing hose system without
the drawbacks of the known systems. This is achieved by embodying a trailing hose
system of the kind described in the introductory part of claim 1 as stated in the characterizing
part of the claim.This ensures that the cutting distributor can be fitted with the cutter plate facing
the connecting hoses so that the hoses can be mounted without sharp bends. The
top end of the hoses at the cutting distributor is under atmospheric pressure
internally, whereby the liquid manure is passed through the hoses in an even flow
with a minimum pressure drop. Furthermore, a self-sharpening effect on the cutter
ring is achieved by the excentric movement of the latter in relation to the cutter
plate, whereby the straw pieces in the liquid manure are effectively shredded.Claim 2 relates to a preferred embodiment of a cutting distributor for a trailing
hose system according to the invention in which the cutting distributor is embodied
with a cutter plate and a belonging cutter ring.Claim 3 relates to a preferred embodiment of a cutting distributor for a trailing
hose system according to the invention in which the cutting distributor is embodied
with two cutter plates with belonging cutter rings. Claim 4 relates to a preferred placing of air admission openings to the cutting
distributor of a trailing hose system according to the invention.According to the description in claim 5 any liquid manure leaking into the innermost,
air-filled space, is hurled outward towards the outlet openings.According to the description in claim 6 the boom is kept in an essentially horizontal
position and as far as possible follows roughnesses in the terrain, and
