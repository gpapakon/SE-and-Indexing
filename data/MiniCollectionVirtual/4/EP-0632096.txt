<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dispersion powder composition containing     a) a base polymer from the group consisting of vinyl ester polymers, styrene polymers, acrylate polymers and vinyl chloride polymers, b) from 2 to 15 % by weight, based on the base polymer, of polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of hydrolysis of from 85 to 95 mol% and a Höppler viscosity of from 2 to 25 mPa.s, c) from 3 to 30 % by weight, based on the total weight of polymeric constituents, of fine antiblocking agent, and d) from 1 to 15 % by weight, based on the base polymer, of amino-functional polyvinyl alcohol which is soluble in cold water and has a Höppler viscosity of from 1 to 20 mPa.s and a saponification (hydrolysis) number of from 0 to 250 and which contains amino-functional vinyl units of the formula CH2 = CH-(CH2)x-NH2 where x = 0 to 4.   The novel dispersion powder composition is particularly suitable for use in building materials, in particular dry mortars, containing Portland cement as inorganic binder, where it results in increased adhesive strength of the mortars.
