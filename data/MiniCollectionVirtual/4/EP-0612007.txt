<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a data transfer system which uses a 
Centronics compatible parallel interface having a 

plurality of control signal lines to transfer signals, 
such as Auto Feed, Select In, PError, nFault, Select and 

Strobe, and a data line for parallel transfer of data 
having a predetermined bit width, and starts high-speed 

transfer at the timing of a change in level the signal 
Auto Feed, Select In, PError, nFault, Select or Strobe. 

In high-speed transfer mode, the data transfer system 
transfers data in parallel to the printer (2) at the 

time where the signal Strobe changes its level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transfer system according to the preamble
of claim 1.A host computer, such as a personal computer, prepares data and sends it to a
printer. The printer edits the received data from the host computer and prints it
out.A data transfer system, which comprises a host computer and a printer, controls
data exchange between the host computer and printer using an interface apparatus.Interface apparatus used in such a system typically use a Centronic compatible
parallel interface.In sending data to a printer from a host computer using a Centronics compatible
parallel interface, the host computer sets data (DAT) byte by byte on a data line
of its own interface, as shown in FIG. 15.When the DATA is set, the host computer then changes a signal Strobe on a
control signal line to a low level from a high level. When detecting this level change, the printer sets a signal BUSY on another
control signal line to a high level and receives the DATA from the host computer.When data reception is complete, the printer sets an signal nAck on another
control signal line to a low level.When the signal Busy on its control signal line is at a high level, the host
computer stops sending data to the printer. When detecting that the signal nAck
on its control signal line becomes a low level, the host computer confirms that the
printer has received the data, and prepares for transmission of the next data to the
printer.Popular printers for use in a system, which comprises a host computer and a
printer, receive a vast amount of data from the host computer and print the data,
such as a monochrome laser printer and a color laser printer.Such printers are demanded to print a variety of data from mainly characters to
characters mixed with graphics or image data, and the amount of data the printers
handle tends to ever increase.Laser printers, different from ordinary wire or thermal dot printers, employ an
electronic photographic system in their print mechanisms, so that printing, once
started, cannot be controlled to be temporarily stopped.To use a low-speed interface to send data from a host computer to a printer,
therefore, the printer is provided with a memory with a one-page capacity, called
a page memory, so that the printer stores all the received data from the host
computer into this page memory and then activates the print mechanism to print
that data.To print data of A4 at 300 dpi, for example, the page memory needs a capacity
of about 1 megabytes. Conventional Centronics compatible parallel

<CLAIMS>
A data transfer system for transferring data from a data transmission
apparatus to a printer via a parallel interface including a plurality of

control signal lines for signal transfer and a data line for parallel transfer
of data having a predetermined bit width, 
characterized in that
 said data
transmission apparatus (1) comprises:


high speed transfer means (11, 12, 16) for setting data in said data line,
changing a level of a data transmission signal to be sent over one of said

plurality of control signal lines from a high level to a low level or from a
low level to a high level, and transferring said data set in said data line in

parallel to said printer (2) at a timing at which said level of said data
transmission signal changes;
state transmission means (11, 12, 16) for changing levels of signals to be
sent over said plurality of control signal lines to predetermined states to

cause said high-speed transfer means (11, 12, 16) to start or end high-speed
transfer; and
synchronous control and error monitoring means for dividing said data to
be sent to said printer (2) into blocks and performing synchronous control

and error monitoring for each block when parallel transfer of said each
block is completed.
Data transfer system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said data
transmission apparatus (1) includes: means for sending test data to said

printer (2); and
 
means for determining a delay time (11, 12, 16) for determining timings at

which said data are set in said data line and at which said level of said
data transmission signal is changed, based on a result of discrimination of

a reception status of said test data received from said printer (2); and

that said printer (2) includes data discriminating means (21, 22, 25) for
receiving said test data from said data transmission apparatus (1),

discriminating a reception status of said test data and sending a
discrimination result to said data transmission apparatus (1),

whereby said data transmission apparatus delays said data to be sent based
on said delay time determined by said determining means (11, 12, 16),

sets said data in said data line, changes said level of said data transmission
signal to be sent over said one of said plurality of control signal lines from

a high level to a low level or from a low level to a high level, and
transfers said data set in said data line in parallel to said printer (2) at a

timing at which said level of said data transmission signal changes.
