<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine (11) 
having at least intake (22,23) port means cooperati
ng with the 
combustion chamber (21) for delivering a charge to the combustion 

chamber (22). In particular, means cooperating with the intake port 
means (22,23) are provided for causing the intake charge delivered to 

the combustion chamber to assume a tumble motion rotating (t,t') about 
a tumble axis (x) that extends transversely to the cylinder bore (13) 

axis, which tumble axis (x) is disposed substantially at the centre 
of the combustion chamber volume (21) when the piston (15) is travelling 

at its maximum speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine having a cylinder defining a cylinder
bore having an axis, a piston reciprocating in said cylinder bore, a cylinder head affixed to
said cylinder and having a surface defining with said cylinder bore and said piston a
combustion chamber, the volume of which varies cyclically upon reciprocation of said piston
within said cylinder bore, intake port means comprising three intake ports with associated
intake passages cooperating with said combustion chamber for delivering a charge to said
combustion chamber, and intake valves cooperating with said intake port means for causing
the intake charge delivered to said combustion chamber to assume a tumble motion.Such an internal combustion engine is known from EP-A-0 390 589. This document
discloses a stratified-combustion internal combustion engine comprising at least two intake
ports situated on one side of a combustion chamber, guide passages connected individually
to the intake ports, a fuel injector disposed in one of the guide passages. Each guide
passage has a straight region extending over a predetermined length from its
corresponding intake port. Thus, an air-fuel mixture and air, guided by the respective
straight regions of the guide passages to be supplied through their corresponding intake
ports to the combustion chamber flow, along the axial direction of a cylinder bore, thereby
forming barrel swirl flows separated in layers from each other.It has been recognized that there are certain advantages
in promoting turbulence in the combustion chamber,
particularly under at least some running conditions and
loads. One type of turbulence which is generated in the
combustion chamber, generally through the use of the
induction system, is "swirl." Swirl is a rotary motion
occurring about an axis that is either coincident with or
parallel to the cylinder bore axis. Another type of motion,
which has been proven to be more effective under at least
some running conditions, is called "tumble." Tumble is also
a swirling motion in the combustion chamber, but tumble
rotates about an axis that is disposed transversely to the
cylinder bore axis. That is, the intake charge is delivered
into the cylinder so as to flow toward one side thereof,
impinge upon the cylinder, be directed downwardly to strike
the head of the piston, and be redirected back toward the
other side of the cylinder so as to generate this tumbling
motion. Like swirl, tumble is generated primarily in the
configuration of the induction system. In
