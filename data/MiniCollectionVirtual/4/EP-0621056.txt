<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to respiratory protective
devices, and in particular to an improved powered
filtering device for use in a respiratory protective
device.As far as is possible, the terminology herein adopted
is in line with European Standard EN 132:1990 the object
of which is to achieve a uniform interpretation of terms
in this art so as to prevent ambiguous use of such terms.Powered filtering devices or turbo filtering devices
are known. In these devices air is delivered to a
facepiece by means of a powered blower normally worn by
the wearer by means of a body harness. The device may be
connected to the facepiece by means of a breathing hose.Powered filtering devices in some measure responsive
to a wearers demand are also known. For example GB 2 032
284 B (RACAL) discloses breathing apparatus including
detector means for detecting exhalation by the wearer
connected to control means for at least reducing flow of
air through filter means and flowing to the wearer during
at least part of each exhale part of the breathing cycle
of the wearer.Such known devices suffer, however, from a number of
problems/disadvantages. For example, in GB 2 032 284 B
the detector means are positioned at or near an inlet to a
hood or facemask, remote from the control means, and
connected thereto by an electrical cable. The cable thus
passes through a flexible breathing hose. The flexibility
of the hose causes the cable to become weakened and liable
to failure, in use.It is, therefore, an object of one aspect of the
present invention to obviate or mitigate the
aforementioned problem/disadvantage.Another problem with known powered filtering devices
is that they tend to be wasteful in that they deliver air 
to a wearer when the wearer has no need of such air.
This unnecessarily consumes filtration capacity and causes
discomfort to the wearer.Partially demand response devices, such as disclosed
in GB 2 032 284 B (RACAL), go some way to mitigating this
problem. However, these devices still waste valuable
electrical energy by overworking the device.It is, therefore, an object of another aspect of the
present invention to obviate or mitigate the
aforementioned problem.A further disadvantage of many known powered
filtering devices is that they provide no measurement of
air flow. Thus, for example, a wearer may be provided
with no indication of any fault occurring within the
device such as a drop in the air flow rate below a minimum
safe set level - for example, due to filter clogging.It is, therefore, an object of another aspect
