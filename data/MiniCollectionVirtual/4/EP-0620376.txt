<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic bearing apparatus, a rotating member (1) 
having an axis of rotation along the horizontal direction is 

supported by a pair of radial magnetic bearings (4,5) each 
including a plurality of electromagnets (4a,4b,5a,5b) in 

the radial direction with clearances with the rotating 
member (1) in two portions in the axial direction. The 

apparatus comprises a pair of position detecting sensors 
(31,32) for detecting the displacement in the radial 

direction of the rotating member (1) in the two positions in 
the axial direction of the rotating member (1) and a control 

device (6) for controlling magnetic attraction forces (F1,F2) 
produced by the electromagnets (4a,4b,5a,5b) on the 

basis of output signals from the respective sensors (31,32). 
The control device (6) determines the magnetic 

attraction force (F1,F2) produced by each of the radial 
magnetic bearings (4,5) on the basis of the output signal 

from each of the sensors (31,32), a value of a control 
current supplied to the electromagnets (4a,4b,5a,5b) in 

the radial magnetic bearing (4,5), and an attraction force 
coefficient of the electromagnets in the radial magnetic 

bearing (4,5), to determine the position of the center of 
gravity of the rotating member on the basis of comparison of 

the calculated magnetic attraction forces (F1,F2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic bearing apparatus of the
type as specified in the preamble of claim 1. Such an apparatus
is known from JP-A-2 097 714. In particular, the invention relates
to a magnetic bearing apparatus for raising a spindle of
a machine tool and controlling the position thereof.There has been conventionally a magnetic bearing
apparatus so adapted as to support a rotating member, for
example, a rotor of a spindle of a machine tool by magnetic
forces of two magnetic bearings disposed in two positions in
the axial direction with clearances between the magnetic
bearings and the rotor, detect the position of the rotor by
a position sensor, and control a current supplied to
electromagnets in the two magnetic bearings on the basis of
a detection signal of the position sensor, thereby to hold
the rotor in a reference position (a target position).Furthermore, in the above described control, the
translation motion and the tilt motion concerning the center
of gravity of the rotor are separately controlled.In the above described magnetic bearing apparatus,
however, when a tool such as a grindstone or a cutter 
mounted on an end of the rotor is replaced on the way, the
quantity of state such as the position of the center of
gravity of the rotor is changed, so that position control
becomes unstable, for example.Therefore, there is provided a control device so
adapted as to input the weight of a tool by inputting means
when the tool is replaced to determine, for example, the
position of the center of gravity (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Gazette No. 97714/1990 = JP-A-2 097 714).In the above described control device, however, the
weight of the tool must be previously grasped, so that it
takes a lot of time and labor to replace the tool.An object of the present invention is to provide a
magnetic bearing apparatus which can automatically determine
new position of the center of gravity even if an addition
heavy product is mounted on a rotating member and can be
suitably used particularly when the translation motion and
the tilt motion concerning the center of gravity of the
rotating member are separately controlled.The above object is solved by an apparatus
as defined in claim 1. Further developments
are covered by the subclaims.Thus in order to attain the above described object, the
present invention provides a magnetic bearing apparatus
comprising first and second radial magnetic bearings each
including a plurality of electromagnets for exerting
magnetic attraction forces produced by the
