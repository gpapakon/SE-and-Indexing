<ABSTRACT>
Process for the isomerisation of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock 
substantially boiling in the gasoline range which feedstock 

comprises linear paraffins having at least five carbon atoms by 
contacting the feedstock in the presence of hydrogen at elevated 

temperature and pressure with a catalyst comprising a MeAPO and/or 
MeAPSO medium-pore molecular sieve and at least one Group VIII metal 

component, wherein Me is at least Mg, Mn, Co or Zn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
isomerisation of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling 
in the gasoline range which feedstock comprises linear paraffins 
having at least five carbon atoms. One of the main objects in nowaday's oil refining is to produce 
gasolines fulfilling the increasing environmental demands on product 
quality and having a high octane number. This means for gasoline that the octane specification has now 
to be established without lead-containing additives, less aromatics, 
in particular benzene, less olefins and lower gasoline vapour 
pressure. Components which improve the octane quality of gasoline include 
branched paraffins. Object of the present invention is to provide 
branched paraffins. Therefore, the present invention relates to a process for the 
isomerisation of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling 
in the gasoline range which feedstock comprises linear paraffins 
having at least five carbon atoms by contacting the feedstock in the 
presence of hydrogen at elevated temperature and pressure with a 
catalyst comprising a MeAPO and/or MeAPSO medium-pore molecular 
sieve and at least one Group VIII metal component, wherein Me is at 
least one of Mg, Mn, Co or Zn. In this way a very attractive high yield of branched paraffins, 
predominantly existing of mono-branched paraffins, can be obtained. 
The mono-branched paraffins obtained in accordance with the present 
process can as such suitably be applied for the production of multibranched 
paraffins, which constitute even more attractive high 
octane gasoline components. In the context of the present invention a MeAPO medium-pore  
 
molecular sieve is defined as a crystalline microporous metal 
aluminophosphate composition having a three-dimensional framework 
structure of interconnected MeO₂, AlO₂ and PO₂ tetrahedral units, 
which framework structure has a medium-pore size. This type of 
molecular sieve and its preparation have for instance been described 
in US 4,567,029 which is hereby incorporated by reference. Moreover, in the context of the present invention a MeAPSO 
molecular sieve is defined as a crystalline microporous metal 
silicoaluminophosphate composition having a three-dimensional 
framework structure of interconnected MeO₂, AlO₂, SiO₂ and PO₂ 
tetrahedral units, which framework structure has a medium-pore size. 
MeAPSO molecular sieves and their preparation have for example been 
disclosed in EP 158348, EP 158975, EP 161489 and EP 161490 which are 
hereby
