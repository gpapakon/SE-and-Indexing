<ABSTRACT>
During a reactive ion etching process (FIG. 5) for making lens 
elements 

(15, FIG.4) in a silica substrate (12), the gas constituency in the 
reactive ion etch 

chamber (17) is changed to adjust the curvature of lens elements (15) 
formed in the silica 

substrate (12) and to reduce the aberrations of such lens elements (15). 
For example, two 

gases, CHF₃ and oxygen may be supplied to the reactive ion etch 
chamber and, 

during the reactive ion etch process, the proportion of oxygen is 
significantly 

reduced, which reduces the aberrations of the lens elements (15) formed 
by the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microlens arrays and, more particularly, to 
microlens arrays made by reactive ion etching. Miniature lenses or microlenses are increasingly in demand for such 
purposes as coupling light from a laser to an optical fiber and coupling light from an 
optical fiber to a photodetector. The U.S. patent of Basavanhally, No. 5,135,590, 
granted August 4, 1992, describes a method for arranging optical fibers in a matrix 
configuration as is required, for example, for free-space switching. Such uses would 
normally require a matrix array of microlenses for containing light projected from 
the optical fiber ends. Thus, considerable effort has been made in developing 
methods for making arrays of microlenses which can be used as a unit, or from 
which individual lenses can be selected for use. One promising method for making microlens arrays comprises the steps 
of forming an array of photoresist elements on a silica substrate, melting the 
elements to cause them to have curved or dome-shaped upper surfaces and thereafter 
solidifying the elements. The photoresist elements and the substrate are then 
subjected to reactive ion etching, that is, etching by a reactive gas in which the 
reaction is enhanced by applied radio frequency power. The photoresist elements 
cause differential etching in the substrate such that, after all of the photoresist has 
been etched, the dome shapes of the original photoresist elements are replicated in 
the silica substrate. This method is for example described in EP-A-458 514. We have found that the reactive ion etching (RIE) method of making 
microlens arrays often results in lenses having undesirable aberrations. Such 
aberrations can result in significant losses of optical energy and can limit the 
functions of optical apparatus. Accordingly, there is a continuing need in the 
industry for dependable methods for making high quality microlens arrays. In accordance with the invention, during the reactive ion etching process 
described above, the gas constituency in the reactive ion etch chamber is changed to 
adjust the curvature of lens elements formed in the silica substrate and to reduce the 
aberrations of such lens elements. For example, two gases, CHF3 and oxygen, may  
 
be supplied to the reactive ion etch chamber and, during the reactive ion etch 
process, the proportion of oxygen is significantly and deliberately reduced, which 
reduces the aberrations of the lens elements formed by the process. These and other objects, features and benefits of
