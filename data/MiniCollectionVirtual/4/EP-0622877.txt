<ABSTRACT>
A tunable laser whose lasing frequency can be changed by varying the 
absorbance of absorber layers (1041 1042) that are placed in a standing wave of the 

laser cavity. Changes in the absorbance of the layers are accomplished by varying 
the strength of the absorber layers through application of voltage to the layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Tunable lasers are increasingly finding specialized use in a wide variety 
of applications, such as spectroscopy and metrology. Use of tunable lasers is likely 
to be expanded in the near future because of recent technological breakthroughs that 
are very likely to lead to the use of tunable lasers as an apparatus for a) optical 
modulation and switching, and b) wavelength division multiplexing in diverse 
applications, such as information processing and networking. The potential expanded technological base for tunable lasers has raised 
the hope that a resulting increase in tunable lasers' volume of production would lead 
to economies of scale that may cause a reduction in their cost. That cost reduction in 
turn, would allow optical devices or optoelectronic devices incorporating tunable 
lasers as one of their components, to compete against other technologies' devices on 
the basis of price in additional markets. That self-fueling cycle of increased 
production and cost reduction for tunable lasers requires design versatility and 
flexibility for those lasers in order to meet the diverse requirements of different 
markets. More specifically, tunable lasers have to be simply controllable and rapidly 
adjustable to desired wavelengths. Unfortunately, market penetration of tunable lasers is inhibited by the 
limitations of existing tunable lasers. One of the limitations of conventional tunable 
lasers relates to the tuning technique of controlling lasers' wavelength by combining 
in a non-integrated fashion, semiconductor-based lasers with optical filters that are 
typically hard to adjust rapidly. The problem associated with the difficulty of laser's 
rapid adjustment also exists with tuning techniques that rely on mechanical 
adjustment of the angle of a grating or prism. The non-integrated merger of the laser 
electronic components with the filtering device optical components and/or the 
mechanically adjusted gratings or prism prevent the creation of readily 
manufacturable, cost-effective Opto Electronic Integrated Circuits (OEIC) that 
incorporate tunable lasers. Newer laser tuning techniques have overcome to a certain extent, the 
integration deficiencies mentioned above, by controlling the lasers' wavelength 
through changes in the refractive index of a material inside the laser. However, those  
 
newer techniques present some undesirable characteristics that limit the scope of 
usage of tunable lasers. For example, these techniques are constrained by the 
difficulty of making large refractive
