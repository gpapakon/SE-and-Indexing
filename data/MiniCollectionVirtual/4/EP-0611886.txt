<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid
injection nozzle according to the preamble of the enclosed
patent claim 1.Generally, in the fuel injection nozzle to be
used in the internal combustion engine, a valve member is
slidably received in a guide hole formed axially in a
valve main body and an injection hole opened in a tip end
portion of the valve main body is opened and closed by
the vertical movement of the valve member. For this
reason, the valve member is controlled accurately in its
lift in opening the valve for the purpose of obtaining an
appropriate fuel injection amount.Examples of the prior art include a fluid
injection nozzle disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. 61-104156 in which a large number of
slit-like orifices are provided in front of the injection
hole so that, by making fuel coming from the injection
hole pass through the slit-like orifices, it is possible
to obtain a spray of fuel atomized and dispersed through
over a wide angle. In the preamble of the patent claim 1, however it is proceeded
from a nozzle with a perforated body as shown in the
printed publication document US 5,402,937 (D1) corresponding to the prepublished EP-A-0 476 298. This
document shows a fluid injection nozzle comprising a first
plate having a first hole and a second plate having a
second hole of a predetermined form, wherein the first and
second plates overlap each other. Thereby, the two holes
form a penetrating opening which penetrates through both
plates so that fluid can be injected through said two
holes into a low pressure space of an internal combustion
engine. As can be seen especially from Fig. 2 of this document, a
cross-sectional area of the first hole and second hole of
said first and second plate, respectively, gets gradually
wider from the upstream side to the downstream side. This
means that especially in the area of the border line
between the first and second plates the fluid flow will be
dammed so that an atomization of the fluid
injected from the second hole can be achieved.In view of the state of the art according to US 5,402,937, it is an
object of the present invention to atomize injection fluid
into fine particles with a fluid injection nozzle having a
simple construction.This problem is solved by a fluid injection nozzle
according to the invention having the technical features
cited in the enclosed patent claim 1. Therefore, the
invention consists in that an area of overlap of the first
hole of said first plate and the second hole of said
second plate is smaller
