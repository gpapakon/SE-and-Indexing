<ABSTRACT>
The present invention involves monoclonal antibodies which recognize a common determinant found on separate and distinct adhesion molecules. The monoclonal antibodies are used for blocking cellular adhesion. Monoclonal antibodies are also described that are capable of binding to a common determinant expressed on separate and distinct selectins and in particular antibodies that bind to both E-selectin (also known as ELAM-1) and L-selectin (also known as LAM-I, LECAM-1, Leu-8, TQ-1, gp 90 MEL-14 and peripheral lymph node homing receptor). The monoclonal antibodies are useful in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases associated with inflammation. The monoclonal antibodies are used for detecting cells bearing selectins. Cell lines capable of producing the above described antibodies are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antibodies that bind to
multiple adhesion molecules and to such antibodies for use in methods for treatment of
diseases. Another aspect of the invention relates to
immunoassays for detection of adhesion molecules.Peripheral blood in the circulatory system of
humans and mammals is comprised principally of red blood
cells, i.e. erythrocytes, and white blood cells, i.e.
leukocytes. The family of white blood cells is comprised of
monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and various
types of lymphocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils
are known as "granulocytes" because of their content of
cytoplasmic granules.Neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils
are known as phagocytes because their primary function in
the human immune system is to phagocytize or ingest
bacteria, microorganisms and other types of foreign
materials. These cells are produced from common progenitor
cells in the bone marrow of a human or animal and are known
to circulate in peripheral blood and finally, enter tissues
as necessary for control of infection or to participate in
inflammatory reactions. However, each of the phagocytes has
different functions and behaves as a related but separate
system.The neutrophil is the most common leukocyte in
human and animal peripheral blood. One microliter of normal
human whole blood contains, on average 5,000 leukocytes of
which 3,075 are neutrophils, 150 are eosinophils, 25 are 
basophils, 250 are monocytes, and 1,500 are lymphocytes.In the response to infection or inflammation, most
leukocytes are activated first to migrate to the appropriate
area in response to chemo-attractant factors such as certain
bacterial products, complement component, cytokines, and
other factors. In addition to leukocytes, these signals can
also activate endothelial cells. As a result of activation,
leukocytes and endothelial cells become adhesive.This attraction process is termed "chemotaxis".
Once in an area of inflammation or infection, most
leukocytes must establish a firm attachment to their
targets. Cell adhesion is mediated through various
ligand-receptor interactions. Examples include cell
receptors for complement; cell receptors for the Fc or cell
binding portion of antibodies; fibronectin receptors and
other adhesion molecules. Most of the receptors associated
with adhesion are glycoproteins.Neutrophils primarily interact with and exit the
arterial-venous system (i.e., extravasate) through the
endothelium of postcapillary venules. During an acute
inflammatory
