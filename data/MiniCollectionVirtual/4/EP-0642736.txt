<ABSTRACT>
An ingredient collector (1) for collecting individual ingredients for common processing includes a row (2) of containers for receiving the different ingredients and a collecting trolley (4), which can be moved on running rails (7) along the row (2) of containers, for receiving the ingredients, each container (3) of the row (2) of containers having a discharging device (6) and the collecting trolley (4) being capable of being held against the discharging device (6) of each of the containers (3), as desired. In order to make it possible to collect ingredients with structural means which are as simple as possible, the collecting trolley (4) has a gravity and/or a clockwork drive (13; 14; 18) and there is provided a locking device (8) for stopping the collecting trolley (4) on the running rails (7) in the region of each container (3).
