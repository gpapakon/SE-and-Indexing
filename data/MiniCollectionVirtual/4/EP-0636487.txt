<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus for recording an image on a recording medium. In this case, as image forming apparatuses, an 
electrophotographic copying machine, a laser beam printer 
(LBP), an LED printer, a facsimile apparatus, a 
wordprocessor, and the like are included. The background art of the present invention will 
be described below. In recent years, a demand has arisen for a 
smaller image forming apparatus with improved 
operability. In order to satisfy this demand from the 
market, the present applicant has 
previously made an invention as disclosed 
in Japanese Patent Application No. 03-07719 (Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 04-240864). The invention of the present application is an 
improvement of the previous invention. It is a concern of the present invention to 
provide an image forming apparatus which can realize a 
further reduction in size.  
 Japanese Patent Abstract No. JP-A-3093576 discloses 
an image forming apparatus having an 
electric circuit board and a conductive cover. In accordance with tile present invention there is 
provided an image forming apparatus as set out in 
claim 1. In order that the present invention may be more 
readily understood embodiments thereof will now be 
described by way of example and with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a sectional side view of a laser beam 
printer to which an embodiment of the present invention 
is applied; Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing the outer 
appearance of the laser beam printer in Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing the interior 
of the laser beam printer in Fig. 1; Fig. 4 is a plan view of a portion near a composite 
electric circuit board; Fig. 5 is a partially cutaway perspective view of 
a portion of an opening/closing cover; Fig. 6 is a side view showing a process cartridge 
mounted within the printer;  
 Fig. 7 is a schematic functional block diagram; Fig. 8 is a sectional side view of another embodiment of 
a laser beam printer according to which the present 
invention is applied; Fig. 9 is a sectional side view of a portion near 
an electric equipment unit; and Fig. 10 is a perspective view showing a method of 
mounting an AC inlet. An image forming apparatus according to an 
embodiment of the present invention will be described 
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a sectional side view of a laser beam 
printer as an image forming apparatus to which the 
present invention is applied. The overall

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus for forming an image on 
a recording medium (2), the apparatus comprising: 


an electric circuit board (16) having power supply 
means (403) and control means (200) for controlling the 

operation of the image forming apparatus, said power supply 
means being adapted to supply power to process means (8, 

10, 11) acting on an electrophotographic photosensitive member 
(7); and 
conveying means (3b, 3c, 3c) for conveying a 
recording medium (2) along a conveying path so that an 

image can be transferred onto the recording medium from 
the electrographic photosensitive member; and 
said circuit board (16) being 
housed in a conductive cover (40, 41) which provides in 

operation a guide for the recording medium as it is 
conveyed along said conveying path, and an 

insulative member (38) being disposed between said circuit 
board and said conductive cover, said conductive cover 

including grounding means (45) for grounding it. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
conductive cover comprises a conductive upper cover (41) 

and a conductive lower cover (40) surrounding said 
electric circuit board, and said insulative member is an 

insulative sheet disposed between said electric circuit  
 

board and said conductive lower cover. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
insulative member is of a material selected from the 

group of denaturated polyphenylene oxide resin (PPO), 
polycarbonate resin (PC), acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene 

copolymer (ABS) resin, and high impact styrole resin. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
conductive cover comprises sheet metal coated with 

aluminum.

16
Ω. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said conductive cover is adapted in operation to guide 

the recording medium fed out from a supply cassette to 
a transfer area where a toner image formed on said 

photosensitive member is transferred to the recording 
medium. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, wherein said  
 

conductive cover is further adapted to guide the 
recording medium having a toner image transferred from 

said photosensitive member to a fixing means (5) for 
fixing the toner image on the recording medium. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
