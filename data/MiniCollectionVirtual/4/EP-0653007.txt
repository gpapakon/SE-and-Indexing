<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement in an elongated working platform (2) which at each end is carried by a mast via a drive support (8) movable along the mast. The drive support includes an electric motor unit by means of which the drive support is drivable along the mast, said drive support pivotally carrying the corresponding end of the platform. At each motor unit an operating means for manual release of a motor brake for lowering the platform in case of power failure, is connected to a levelling device (24-38). The levelling device is arranged to be triggered in order to prevent movement of a drive support resulting in deviation of the platform from a position essentially corresponding to the horizontal position, said transmission being arranged to return the operating means to a position activating the motor brake, if the manual release of the motor brake causes triggering of the levelling device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement in an 
elongated working platform which at each end is carried by 
a mast via a drive support movable along the mast and 
including an electric motor unit by means of which the 
drive support is drivable along the mast, said drive 
support pivotally carrying the corresponding end of the 
platform. The object of the invention is to make possible, in a 
platform of the above indicated kind, lowering of the 
platform in a safe way in case of power failure. According to the invention this is attained in that, at 
each motor unit, an operating means for manual release of a 
motor brake, for lowering the platform in case of power 
failure, is connected to a levelling device 
which comprises a transmission (38) and which is 
arranged to be triggered in order to prevent movement of a 
drive support resulting in deviation of the platform from a 
position substantially corresponding to the horizontal 
position, said transmission being arranged to return the 
operating means to a position activating the motor brake, 
if the manual release of the motor brake causes triggering 
of the levelling device. Thus, by means of the invention tilting of the working 
platform is prevented when the motor brakes are manually 
released, so that the platform by its own weight slides 
along the mast. An embodiment of the invention shall now be described 
more closely below with reference to the attached drawings, 
on which 
Figure 1 is a sideview illustrating a two mast working 
platform of the kind in which the invention can be used, Figure 2 to a greater scale illustrates a part 
in connection with the left 
hand mast of the platform shown in Figure 1, and Figure 3 likewise to a greater scale shows a view 
perpendicular to Figure 2 of said part. Figure 1 illustrates how an elongated working platform 
2, built up by means of framework sections, at each end is 
carried by a framework mast 4 and 6, respectively, via a 
respective drive support 8 and 10 movable along the mast. 
More particularly, the drive support, in a manner known per 
se and not shown, by means of rollers can abut against 
longitudinally extending roller races of the mast and be 
carried via tooth wheels on a tooth rack extending along 
the mast. The tooth wheels are driven by an electric motor 
unit 12 and 14, respectively, only schematically 
illustrated in Figure 1, so that the respective drive 
supports 8 and 10 can be driven along the mast. The drive supports 8 and 10 pivotally carry the 
platform 2 at the

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement in an elongated working platform (2) 
which at each end is carried by a mast (4,6) via a drive 

support (8,10) movable along the mast and including an 
electric motor unit (12,14) by means of which the drive 

support is drivable along the mast, said drive support 
pivotally carrying the corresponding end of the platform, 

characterized in that, at each motor unit (12,14), an 
operating means (54) for manual release of a motor brake 

(50,52), for lowering the platform in case of power 
failure, is connected to a levelling device (24-38) 

which comprises a transmission (38) and which 
is arranged to be triggered in order to prevent movement of 

a drive support resulting in deviation of the platform from 
a position substantially corresponding to the horizontal 

position, said transmission (38) being arranged to return 
the operating means (54) to a position activating the motor 

brake, if the manual release of the motor brake causes 
triggering of the levelling device. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 
that the levelling device at each drive support comprises a 

mechanism (24-32) acting upon tilting of the platform (2) 
with respect to the corresponding mast, and by means of 

which the levelling device is connected to the transmission 
(38). 
An arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterized 
in
 that the mechanism includes a mechanical means (24), 
reacting by a mechanical movement on tilting of the 

platform (2), and being mechanically connected with the 
transmission, which is deviced as a mechanical transmission 

device (38), so that said mechanical movement is 
transferred to a return movement of the operating means 

(54). 
An arrangement according to claim 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the mechanical means comprises a cam (28), the 
movement of which being sensed by a cam follower (30), 

which is connected to the transmission which is arranged as 
a Bowden cable (38), link train or similar. 
An arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterized 
in
 that the movement of the cam (28) is a translatory  
 

movement, and that the cam follower (30) forms part of a 
two arm lever (32), which is pivotally carried between its 

ends, of which one abuts the cam and the other one (36) is 
connected to the transmission (38).
