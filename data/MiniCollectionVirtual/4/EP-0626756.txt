<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device, and more particularly, to an improvement of a
metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) output circuit.In a MOS memory device such as a dynamic random
access memory (DRAM), a prior art output circuit is formed
by two MOS transistors in series between a positive
potential power supply Vcc such as 5V or 3.3V and a
ground potential power supply Vss (=0V). When two input
signals at two input nodes are supplied to gates of the
respective MOS transistors, as a result, an output
signal is obtained at an output node between the MOS
transistors in accordance with the input signals. In this
case, if the output signal is too low or high, an off-state
of one of the two transistors is changed to ON.
Particularly, as a result, if minority carriers are
generated, data stored in memory cells may be destroyed.
In order to avoid this, an additional MOS transistor is
provided between one of the input nodes and the output
node.However, there are actually a plurality of
output circuits in a MOS memory device. As a result, one
output circuit may be erroneously operated by the
operation of the other output circuits. This will be
explained later in detail. A semiconductor device according to the preamble of claim 1
is disclosed in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 22,
No. 3, August 1979, pages 939-940. This semiconductor
device is a driver protection circuit in which the gate of
the third transistor is biased in order to prevent that
both the first and second transistors are in the conducting
state.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
output circuit which can avoid interference with other
circuits.This object is achieved by a semiconductur device as
defined in claim 1; the dependent claims are related to
further developments of the invention. The present invention will be more clearly
understood from the description as set forth below, as
compared with the prior art, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, wherein:
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a prior art
semiconductor device;Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of a semiconductor device
where a plurality of circuits as illustrated in Fig. 2
are arranged;Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating a first
embodiment of the semiconductor device according to the
present invention;Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram of a semiconductor device
wherein a plurality of circuits as illustrated in Fig. 3
are arranged;Fig. 5A is a partial plan view of Fig. 3;Fig. 5B is a partial cross-sectional view taken along
the line
