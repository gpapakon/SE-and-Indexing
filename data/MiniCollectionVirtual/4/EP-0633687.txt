<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is disclosed for reading out by scanning an image on a 
transparent sheet (10) such as photographic film in medical 

applications. The apparatus comprises illumination means (22), 
scanning means (21) with at least one photosensitive element, and 

transport means for transporting said sheet between said 
illumination means and said photosensitive element, wherein said 

transport means is formed by : 

means for keeping at least the portion of the sheet which is 
being illuminated in an upright position ; 
a planar substantially horizontal sheet support (35) for keeping 
contact with the bottom edge (19) of said sheet (10), thereby to 

guide the bottom edge of said sheet in a substantially horizontal 
plane ; and 
a carrier (23) arranged for movement in a plane parallel to the 
sheet support (35) and for abutting against the upstanding rear 

edge (18) of the sheet, thereby to move the sheet forward over 
the support (35) by such abutting contact. 
 
These arrangements guarantee a uniform slowscanspeed, fixed angular 

orientations, accurate vertical and transversal positioning during 
scanning. Vertical pressure means (45), operative on the top edge of 

the sheet (46) can supplement the force of gravity. Compact design, 
ease of use and high throughput are improved by a U-shaped guide 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for reading out an
image on a transparent sheet and is intended in particular for use
in medical or graphical applications.In clinical or private radiology departments, patients are
examined by means of non-invasive techniques, such as X-ray imaging,
computed tomography, magnetic resonance, ultrasound etc. All these
techniques deliver images : directly on transparent photographic
film for use in medical imaging ; or computer images, that can be
recorded on this type of film too.These films are very useful for the radiologist to examine the
pathology in detail. The same film can also be transported to other
departments and other physicians. The film can be stored for years
and retrieved whenever necessary for comparison with the current
situation.Problems arise when the same images must be available at two
different locations at the same time for examination, or when the
locations are so distant that the transport time becomes critical.
The storage organisation and storage area pose also a problem in
some hospitals, where by preference the patient carries the films
home to keep them. Mostly, these films are even more difficult to
retrieve, because the patient has lost them. These problems can be
solved by scanning and digitising the films, used for visual
examination, directly as they are produced (developed and dry) or
before they leave the radiology department, to produce computer
images from the films. These computer images can then be stored
consistently by electronic means in digital format.Nowadays, a lot of image processing can be done on images in
digital format. E.g. in order to compare semi-automatically older
medical images on film with currently acquired data, the images on
the older films must be made available in digital format as computer
images.Reproduction of images from a transparent sheet on other media,
is described in the European patent application EP 0 452 570 A1 
"Processing and digitizing apparatus for medical radiographic film."
by H. A. Primo et al.The conversion of images - on transparent hardcopy media such as
medical imaging photographic film - to computer images in digital
format, needs the process of digitising the film.Digitising is the process of converting optical densities of an
image on a transparent sheet to binary (digital) electrical signals
that represent the varying intensities of the transmitted light and
thus said densities.The optical densities are measured by transmission of a light
beam from a calibrated light
