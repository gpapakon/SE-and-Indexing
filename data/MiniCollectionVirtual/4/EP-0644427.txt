<ABSTRACT>
A differential variable capacitance acceleration sensor 
includes a sandwich structure having three stacked plates (10, 

40, 60) of silicon with the centre plate (10) mounted such that 
its centre portion (12) is enabled to move in a sealed cavity 

with each side thereof moving toward and away from a fixed 
cooperating plate (40, 60) forming the opposite side of a 

capacitive circuit. The centre portion (12) or mass of the 
centre plate (10) is suspended from its rim (14) by means of a 

large number of integral fingers (18, 20) extending from the rim 
(14) to the top and bottom surfaces of the centre portion (12). 

This centre mass (12) includes a number of through holes (16) to 
permit the passage of air from one side to the other and may also 

include grooves to aid in the flow of air. The fixed top plate 
(40) or lid and the base (60) also have, or may have, grooves 

(46, 66) to assist in the passage of air. The integral fingers 
(18, 20) are formed in sinuous curves or other form varying from 

straightness but having a significant tension such that when the 
centre mass (12) is displaced during a sensed acceleration, the 

fingers (18, 20) tend toward straightness. In an alternative 
embodiment, the fingers are bars (108) having corrugations 

stepped between different planes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a capacitive 
transducer and more particularly to a differential 
capacitive acceleration transducer or sensor which 
utilizes a layered sandwich-type structure wherein a 
movable plate in a central layer is mounted to move in 
piston-like fashion in a cavity toward and away from a 
pair of outer layers consisting of fixed plates to provide 
an exceptionally large area of movement of the movable 
plate and wherein the movable plate is suspended in a 
differential manner from supports in two separate planes. A capacitive transducer of the general type 
here under consideration is described in U.S. Pat. No. 
4,825,335. As described in that patent the movable plate 
is suspended from a rim on two sets of suspending members 
or fingers extending from the opposite surfaces of the 
movable plate. The movable plate utilizes a plurality of 
spaced holes or passages for movement of fluid 
therethrough. The fluid (air) moves through the 
passages as the plate moves back and forth. Grooves on 
the surfaces of the plate direct the flow of fluid toward 
and away from the passages. Also taught is the use of 
spots of glass as stops over the movable plate. In the 
event of an overload the stops prevent electrical shorting 
of the plates. The spots, in addition, prevent two forms 
of latch-up in an overload. In very sensitive 
capacitive sensors, the attractive force of the 
electrical bias or carrier will exceed the spring force of 
the membrane mounting the movable piston at some proximity 
in the movement of the piston-like plate toward the fixed 
plate. Therefore, the plates latch together. Another latch-up problem can take the form of 
pneumatic latch-up. That is, as flat plates are brought 
into very close proximity with each other, the flow  
 
resistance into the space between them becomes very high. 
It may take a long time (several seconds) for gas to re-enter 
this space in a sensitive capacitive sensor, and 
allow the moving plate to return to its normal position 
after an overload. The stop spots spaced over the surface 
of the plate keep the space open between the two plates to 
allow gas flow and rapid recovery. An additional feature taught in the above patent 
is the use of small silicon knobs, ridges, bars or other 
protuberances on the core which are jammed into an 
aluminum film on an opposing part of the sandwich, which 
has the effect that the knobs are held in contact by 
elastic deformation of the underlying material which makes 
for a stable connection between the

A differential variable capacitance transducer

a rim of insulating material (42) and a surface (44) thereof 
acting as a first plate of a capacitor, a second layer (60) of 

semiconductor material having a rim of insulating material
