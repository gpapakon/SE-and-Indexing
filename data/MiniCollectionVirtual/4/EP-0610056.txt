<ABSTRACT>
A hydrogel dressing is provided which is suitable for 
adherence to an adhesive coated backing of a bandage. The 

dressing consists of a layer of hydrogel in face-to-face 
relationship with a substrate. The hydrogel facing 

surface of the substrate preferably comprises fibers 
projecting into the hydrogel and the opposed surface 

preferably comprises a hydrogel occlusive polymeric film. 
The hydrogel is crosslinked, in situ, on the substrate and 

thereby firmly anchors thereto. The occlusive film 
assures adhesion of the dressing to an adhesive coated 

bandage backing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydrogel bandages.The use of hydrogels in the treatment and management
of burns and wounds is well known in the art. Hydrogel
dressings are further desirable because wound exudate does
not generally dry and consolidate with hydrogels or
hydrogel laminates. Consequently, removal of a hydrogel
dressing is usually neither painful nor detrimental to the
healing process. It has been suggested that hydrogel
dressings may be particularly desirable for treatment of
burns because they may accelerate healing. Although the
mechanism by which hydrogels stimulate healing is not
fully elucidated, it is documented that the high water
content of hydrogels enables them to effect an immediate
cooling of the wound surface and to sustain the reduced
temperature for up to six hours. Davis, et al., "A New
Hydrogel Dressing Accelerates Second-Degree Burn Wound
Healing," Poster Presentation, Wound Healing Society First
Annual Meeting, Galveston, Tx, Feb. 6, 1991. In addition,
water swollen hydrogels may provide a cushioning effect
that helps protect the burn or wound from physical trauma.U.S. Patent 4,438,258 relates to hydrogels which may
be used as interfaces between damaged skin tissue and its
external environment. As disclosed therein, hydrogels may
be polymerized about some type of support, such as a mesh
of nylon, used as an unsupported film, spun in fibers and
woven into a fabric, or used as a powder. Further, 
hydrogels may be used to provide a controlled release of
medical composition.U.S. Patent 4,552,138 discloses a wound dressing
material of at least one layer of polymeric, hydrophilic
gel wherein the gel is cross-linked and acetalized with
formaldehyde. As disclosed therein, a gel film may be
formed by spreading a pre-crosslinked gel on an auxiliary
carrier, drying and at the same time cross-linking the
same by heat treatment. As used in this disclosure,
uncrosslinked polyvinyl alcohol is dissolved in water,
acidified, preferably by hydrochloric acid, and combined
with an aqueous formaldehyde solution and left to react or
pre-crosslink at 50-80Â°C for several hours to obtain a
gelatinous mass wherein no further free aldehyde can be
detected. Such gel films may be placed on the wound as
such, but they are preferably processed to a laminated
product with one or more carrier materials and used in
this form. The carrier layers are laminated into or onto
the pre-crosslinked gel layer and may be further cross-linked
to bond more firmly with the gel.U.S. Patent 4,554,317 discloses a synthetic

A hydrogel dressing suitable for use in a pressure sensitive adhesive bandage
comprising:


a layer of hydrogel, said hydrogel comprising a cross-linkable polymer and
water;
said hydrogel layer being in a face-to-face relationship with a substrate, said
substrate having a hydrogel facing surface and an opposed surface;
said hydrogel facing surface comprising a fibrous layer having a thickness of
0.127-0.381 mm and said hydrogel facing surface having anchoring projections

extending into said hydrogel layer;
said opposed surface being hydrogel occlusive and comprising an extruded
polymer film; and said hydrogel being cross-linked, in situ, on said hydrogel facing

surface and thereby anchored to said surface.
The dressing of claim 1 wherein said fibrous layer comprises fibres selected
from the group consisting of rayon, polyester, wood pulp, cotton, cotton linters, wool

fibres or combinations thereof.
The dressing of claim 2 wherein the fibres are in the form selected from the
group consisting of paper, board or fabric.
The dressing of claim 3 wherein the fabric is a non-woven fabric.
The dressing of claim 1 wherein the fibres of said fibrous layer have a length of
from 0.8 mm (1/32 inch) to 76.2 mm (3 inches).
The dressing of claim 1 wherein the fibres of said fibrous layer have a denier per
filament of from 0.5 to 2.
The dressing of any preceding claim wherein the fibrous layer has a thickness of
0.203 mm (8 mil) to 0.305 mm (12mil).
