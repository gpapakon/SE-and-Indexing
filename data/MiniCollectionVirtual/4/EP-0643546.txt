<ABSTRACT>
In a data communication system, a non-ISDN terminal transmits 
a signal at twice the rate of the ISDN basic interface to the ISDN where it 

is divided into B1 and B2 channel signals and sent over separate 
channels to a distant periphery of the network where they are byte-interleaved 

into a single data stream. A terminal adapter for protocol 
conversions between non-ISDN terminal and the ISDN network includes 

a data receiver for receiving a data stream from the ISDN network at 
twice the rate of the basic interface. The received data stream is byte-deinterleaved 

into first and second frame sequences corresponding 
respectively to the separate channels. An earlier one of these frame 

sequences is stored into a buffer memory until the other frame 
sequence arrives and read therefrom to one of the inputs of an 

interleaver where it is byte-interleaved with the other frame sequence 
into a single data stream and supplied to the non-ISDN terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ISDN (integrated services 
digital network) terminal adapter for coupling non-ISDN terminal 
equipment to the ISDN network. The ISDN terminal adapter is a device that is used to provide 
protocol conversions between non-ISDN terminal equipment such as 
X.25 data terminal equipment and the ISDN. Transmission of a 128 
kbps signal from such terminal equipment is carried out by using the B1 
and B2 channels of the basic rate of the ISDN interface. The transmitted 
signal is divided into 64-kbps component signals at the entry point of 
the network and transmitted over separate paths to an exit point of the 
network where they are byte-interleaved into a 128-kbps data stream 
and forwarded to the destination terminal equipment. Since the 
separate paths are established independently in the network, there is a 
difference in path length between the transmitted signals, so that they 
arrive at the destination at different times. In order to compensate for the path length difference, the 128-kbps 
signal received at the destination terminal is byte-deinterleaved 
into component signals and respectively stored into two buffer 
memories each with a capacity sufficient to hold the respective 
component signal. If the unit of data to be transmitted is 500 kilobytes, 
each buffer memory is required to store 250 kilobytes of data. 
Therefore, it is desired to reduce the amount of memory for timing 
difference compensation.  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an 
ISDN terminal adapter that allows reduction in memory capacity for 
compensating for the timing difference between signals transmitted 
over separate paths of the ISDN network. According to the present invention, there is provided an ISDN 
terminal adapter connected to a non-ISDN terminal equipment which 
generates a signal at twice the rate of the ISDN basic interface. The 
terminal adapter comprises a data transmitter for transmitting the signal 
to an ISDN network where the signal is divided into two channel signals 
and carried on separate channels to a distant periphery of the network 
where the channel signals are byte-interleaved into a single data stream 
for transmission to a destination terminal. A data stream at twice the 
rate of the basic interface from the ISDN network is received and byte-deinterleaved 
into first and second frame sequences so that they 
correspond respectively to the separate channels. First and second 
switching circuits are provided and a buffer memory is
