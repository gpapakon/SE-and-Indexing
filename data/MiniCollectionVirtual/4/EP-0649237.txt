<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an AFC 
circuit, and more particularly, to an AFC circuit for a QPSK 
demodulator which is effective for a QPSK (quadrature-phase 
shift keying) modulated signal demodulation system which is 
utilized in fields of a satellite communication or a 
satellite broadcasting. There is a digital modulation technology useful for 
improvement of high quality transmission and frequency 
utilizing efficiency available for systems for transmitting 
video signals and/or audio signals and has been so far used 
in the fields of microwave ground communications and business 
use satellite communications. As the digital modulation 
system, 16QPAM (16-points Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) 
and 64QPAM (64-points Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), which 
have a good frequency utilization efficiency, are used for 
ground microwave telecommunication circuits, etc. On the 
other hand, a BPSK (Bi-Phase Shift Keying) modulation system 
and a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation system, 
etc. which have a relatively low transmission code error rate 
have been generally used for satellite telecommunication 
circuits. FIGURE 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional 
demodulator. A QPSK modulated signal input to an input 
terminal 1 is parallelly supplied to both an in-phase  
 
detector 2 and a quadrature-phase detector 3. Local 
oscillation signals given to the detectors 2 and 3 are local 
oscillation signals generated from a fixed frequency local 
oscillator 5, which are divided to a 0° phase local 
oscillation signal and a 90° phase local oscillation signal 
by a distributor 4. Signals detected by the detectors 2, 3 
are supplied to A/D converters 6, 7, respectively for 
conversions into digital values. These digitized detection 
signals are supplied to digital low-pass filters (LPFs) 8, 9 
which have the same frequency transmission characteristic, 
respectively, for shaping their spectrums. These digital 
LPFs 8, 9 provide transmission characteristics required for 
preventing intersymbol interferences in a digital data 
transmission. These digital LPFs 8, 9 are also designed so 
that so-called roll off characteristics can be generally 
obtained when then are associated with filter characteristics 
in transmission part. Therefore, the detection signals are 
spectrally shaped through these digital LPFs 8, 9 to make the 
eye-aperture rate sufficiency large. These filtered signals 
from the digital LPFs 8, 9 are each branched into two paths 
so that ones are supplied to a
