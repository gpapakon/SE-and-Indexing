<ABSTRACT>
Magnetic bar (strip) (10) including an elongate magnetised core (11) along a mid-line (L) trapped between two pole pieces (12,13) which are parallel to one another and run along the side of this magnetised core transversely to its permanent magnetisation, characterised in that this magnetised core comprises substantially, along this mid-line, discontinuous succession of separate identical magnets (14). The invention applies particularly to the production of magnetic bearings or magnetic thrust bearings.
