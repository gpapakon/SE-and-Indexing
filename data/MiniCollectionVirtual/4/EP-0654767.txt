<ABSTRACT>
The printer (10) of a POS terminal possesses a first connector (52) through which it exchanges 
data with a PC control unit (11) on a logical level, and a second connector (51) through which 

it exchanges data with an external device, for instance a display module. The printer is housed 
inside the first body frame in which both these connectors are installed. The PC control unit 

possesses a data processing system (20) driven by a general-purpose OS, and a control device 
connector which is connected to the first connector (52). The control unit is housed inside a 

second body frame in which the control device connector is installed. The second body frame 
is installed at or in said first body frame in a detachable manner so that both body frames are 

integrated as a single unit, and the control device connector is connected to the first connector. 
Thereby a POS terminal is provided that can be made compact and inexpensive by integrating 

the printer and control unit to single unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to POS terminals, and more particularly to POS terminals in which a
personal computer is employed as the control device for the printer and other equipment.A POS terminal consists of a control device that generates the data to be displayed or printed
based on data input by sales personnel, such as the name and price of products purchased, a
display module that displays said data after receiving it, and a printer that prints out said data.
The conventional approach is to dedicate a unit as a POS terminal, integrating all of these
devices. However, because the devices are integrated as one unit, this type of POS terminal
lacks versatility and expandability. Furthermore, because it is developed exclusively for specific
POS applications, its production volume tends to be small. Consequently, these POS terminals
tend to be high in cost, and become obstacles against computerization in the POS field. To
solve these problems, more efforts are being made toward the development of PC-POS
systems, that use a general-purpose personal computer (hereafter referred to as "PC") as the
control device, to which a display module and a printer are connected via general-purpose
interfaces. In a PC-POS system, the same hardware can be used for many types of applications
through the use of dedicated software for each POS application. Furthermore, by using a
commercially available printed circuit board set, the PC that makes up the control device can be
configured inexpensively, and its functions can be easily expanded and changed. Therefore,
PC-POS systems are quite effective for computerizing the POS field.However, conventional PC-POS systems require the type of connection shown in the block
diagram in Figure 13, because of the requirement that the general-purpose interface provided in
the PC be used. In the figure, 60 is a display module, 61 is a printer, and 62 is the control unit
which sends data to display module 60 and printer 61. Display module 60 is equipped with a
pass-through function. (This function does not forward a command or data sent by a device
upstream to a device downstream, if the command or the data is intended only for the display
module itself. The function will send the command or the data to a device downstream, if the
command or the data is not intended for the display module itself, or if it is intended for both
the display module and the device downstream.) As shown in the figure, in this POS terminal,
the data from control unit 62 is input into display module 60, and the data
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A POS terminal including at least a printing apparatus (10) and a control unit (11)
for sending data containing print data and/or control commands to said printing apparatus,

wherein:

said printing apparatus comprises a first body frame (70) housing,
first connector means (52) for electrical connection to said control unit (11) to allow
exchange of data between the control unit (11) and the printing apparatus (10),
second connector means (51) for electrical connection to an external device (35) other
than said control unit (11), and
first data processing means (50; 50') for processing first data input via said first
connector means (52) and second data input via said second connector means (51); and
said control unit (11) comprises a second body frame (71, 72) housing,
second data processing means (20) controlled by a general-purpose operating system,
and
third connector means (56);
said first body frame (70) and said second body frame (71, 72) being detachably
mounted to each other so as to form one unit, and the third connector means (56) being

detachably connected to said first connector means (52).
A POS terminal according to Claim 1, wherein said printing apparatus (10) further
comprises;


a connection verifying means (DET) for detecting the connection between said first
and third connector means (52, 56);
said first data processing means (50; 50') selectively processing said first data, when
connected, and said second data, when disconnected, corresponding to an output of said

connection verifying means.
A POS terminal according to Claim 2, wherein said printing apparatus (10) further
comprises;

   data transfer means for transferring data input via said first connector means (52) to
said second connector means (51).
A POS terminal according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein said second body frame (71, 72)
has a protruding section (73) at a position to cover said second connector means (51) of the

printing apparatus so as to prevent the latter from being connected to an external device.
A POS terminal according to Claim 4, wherein said printing apparatus (10) further
comprises


fourth connector means (57) for connecting a display means (35), and
data transfer means (54) for transferring data input via said first connector means (52)
to said fourth connecting means (57).
A printing apparatus for a POS terminal comprising:

first connector means (52) adapted to be connected to an external control device (11)
for exchanging first data including print data and/or control commands with said external

control device,
second connector means (51) adapted to be connected to a device (35) other than
said external control device (11) for exchanging second data similar to said first data with the
