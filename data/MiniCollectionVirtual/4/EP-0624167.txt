<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the separation and 
partial recovery of components of a complex mixture of 
organic compounds and inorganic compounds. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a process for the 
separation of mixtures of compounds resulting from the 
preparation of an olefin polymerization catalyst precursor. The polymerization of lower α-olefins to produce 
thermoplastic polymers is an industry of substar.cial 
commercial importance. The polymeric products of such a 
process, e.g., polypropylene, polyethylene and ethylene/ 
propylene copolymers, are materials of commerce because of 
the relatively low cost of the polymers and the desirable 
properties they possess. The polymerization of ethylene is 
relatively uncomplicated because the polyethylene polymer 
exists in only one steric form. Higher α-olefins such as 
propylene form polymers of several steric types because of 
the pendant alkyl group of the olefin monomer. The cost 
and value of polypropylene, for example, will be greatly 
influenced by the steric form in which the polymer is 
produced. Most commercial Poly-propylene is crystalline 
and highly stereoregular and is usually isotactic. 
Polypropylene which is not stereoregular is termed atactic 
and is not crystalline. This amorphous polymer is less 
desirable and, if present in substantial quantities, must 
usually be removed as by extraction before the poly-propylene 
will have commercially attractive properties. In 
recent commercial polypropylene production, it is virtually 
mandatory for economic reasons to employ a polymerization 
catalyst which is highly stereoregular and sufficiently 
active so that polypropylene of acceptable properties will  
 
be produced without the need for extraction or deashing 
steps. The production of such an active, stereoregular 
catalyst is frequently a rather complicated process with 
much of the complexity being encountered during the production 
of what is conventionally termed the olefin polymerization 
procatalyst. This catalyst precursor is frequently 
a titanium-containing solid and often contains 
moieties of magnesium and halide, particularly chloride. 
Such procatalysts are described in numerous patents and 
other references and vary in chemical character, depending 
upon the particular catalyst desired. One class of procatalyst 
results from the reaction of a magnesium compound, 
often a magnesium alkoxide compound, with a tetravalent 
titanium halide in the presence of a halohydrocarbon 
reaction diluent and an electron donor

<CLAIMS>
A process for the separation of titanium 
tetrachloride and halohydrocarbon from a mixture thereof 

with at least some of titanium tetraalkoxide, tetravalent 
titanium chloroalkoxy compounds, alkyl esters of aromatic 

carboxylic acids and complexes thereof by adding to the 
mixture a separation solvent of boiling point intermediate 

to (1) the titanium tetrachloride and halohydrocarbon and 
(2) the remaining mixture components, passing the resulting 

mixture to a first distillation zone from which a mixture 
of titanium tetrachloride and halohydrocarbon is obtained 

from the upper portion of the zone, passing the bottoms 
product of the first distillation zone to a second 

distillation zone wherein separation solvent is obtained 
from the upper portion of the zone and bottoms product is 

removed from the lower portion of the zone. 
The process of claim 1 wherein each distillation 
zone operates at reduced pressure. 
The process of claim 2 wherein each alkoxide 
is alkoxide of up to 4 carbon atoms inclusive. 
The process of claim 3 wherein the halohydrocarbon 
is chlorobenzene. 
The process of claim 4 wherein the 
separation solvent is dichlorobenzene or chlorotoluene. 
The process of claim 5 wherein separation 
solvent from the second distillation zone is returned to 

the first distillation zone. 
The process of claim 6 wherein the first 
distillation zone operates at a pressure from 50 mbar 

to 200 mbar and in a temperature range from 49°C to 71°C 
(120°F to 160°F) at the top of the zone to from 82°C to 104°C 

(180°F to 220°F) at the bottom of the zone. 
The process of claim 7 wherein the second 
distillation zone operates at a pressure from 50 mbar 

to 200 mbar and within a temperature range of from  
 

49°C to 82°C (120°F to 180°F) at the top of the column and 
from 82°C to 116°C (180°F to 240°F) at the bottom of the 

column. 
The process of claim 8 wherein each alkoxide 
is ethoxide. 
The process of claim 9 wherein the separation 
solvent is dichlorobenzene. 
The process of claim 9 wherein the separation 
solvent is ortho-chlorotoluene. 
The process of claim 9 wherein the proportion 
of titanium tetrachloride separated in the first 

distillation zone is greater than the proportion of 
titanium tetrachloride present in the product mixture.
