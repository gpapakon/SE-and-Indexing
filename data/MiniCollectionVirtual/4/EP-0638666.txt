<ABSTRACT>
The novel jumper switch means of the invention is directed to by-passing 
an electrolyzer in a row of electrolyzers electrically connected 

in series to permit removal of the by-passed electrolyzer for 
maintenance. The jumper switch means comprises one or more internal 

bus bars connected to suitable arrays of switches. Said internal bus 
bars are dimensioned in such a way that when substantially all the 

electrolysis current flows through the jumper switch means, the voltage 
at its two connection terminals and therefore at the contact points of 

the by-passed electrolyzer, is close to, but in any case lower than the 
voltage spontaneously reached by the electrolyzer when electrolysis 

current is no more fed. Further, the present invention offers the 
possibility of housing said array of switches and said internal bus bars 

in a structure having a U-shape wherein the planar part has a limited 
height. Said limited height does not hinder the lateral removal of the by-passed 

electrolyzer by a suitable fork-lift truck.

<DESCRIPTION>
The industrial products of greatest interest in the electrochemical field, 
that is chlorine and caustic obtained by electrolysis of aqueous 
solutions of sodium chloride, and hydrogen and oxygen obtained by 
water electrolysis, are produced in plants comprising a large number of 
electrolyzers electrically connected in series to an electric power source. 
When one of these electrolyzers needs maintenance, a suitable jumper 
switch means is connected to the electrolyzers immediately preceding 
and following the electrolyzer to be by-passed so that a low resistance 
path is formed which is preferentially flown by electric current. In this 
way the by-passed electrolyzer, wherein electric current no more travels, 
is shut down and removed from the row to be sent to maintenance. 
The electric current continues to travel through the electrolyzers circuit 
and, in correspondence of the point where the electrolyzer has been 
removed, it flows through the jumper switch means. When maintenance 
is over, the serviced electrolyzer is positioned again in the row and 
electrically connected through the relevant connections to the 
immediately preceding and following electrolyzers. Then the jumper 
switch means is disconnected following a sequence of operations 
allowing electric current to be fed again to the serviced electrolyzer. The connection of the jumper switch means, which is the initial stage of 
the removal of the electrolyzer to be serviced, poses several problems. 
The first of these problems is related in particular to high current 
monopolar electrolyzers, wherein connection of the jumper switch  
 
means may cause a current shift which may damage the internal 
components of the electrolyzers immediately preceding and following the 
electrolyzer to be bypassed. This problem may be overcome as taught in 
US patents nos. 3,930,978 - 4,078,984 and in the European publication 
no. 0492551 A1, by using jumper switch means provided with multiple 
extension arms and positioned beneath the electrolyzers supporting 
base or above the electrolyzers, by means of cranes. Both 
configurations, which result from the presence of the multiple 
extension arms, permit also to solve the second problem typically 
affecting the jumper switch means of the prior art. These latter 
conventionally have the form of carts which can be moved along the 
supporting base of the electrolyzers and laterally with respect to the 
electrolyzers row. As the vertical size of said jumper switch means carts 
is remarkable, the electrolyzer
