<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a new derivative of 2-piperazinylindol, 
3-[2-(1-(4'-piperonylpiperazinyl)) 
indolyl]-carboxaldehyde, useful as an agent acting on the 
central nervous system. In accordance with the invention, a compound of 
formula (I) is provided, 3-[2-(1-(4'-piperonylpiperazinyl)) 
indolyl]-carboxaldehyde: 
   and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Patent ES 454234, applied for on 14.12.76 
(Hoechst), describes and claims a method to obtain an indole 
derivative of general formula (II):     where R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and m represent a 
multitude of possible replacements, due to 
which this general formula takes in 
millions of different products, of which 
only a very small number are specifically 
described. It is stated in said patent ES 454234 that these 
products derived from Indole possess valuable 
pharmacological properties, being especially efficacious for 
cardiac circulation. The product object of the present patent, 3-[2-(1-(4'-piperonylpiperazinyl))indolyl]-carboxaldehyde, 
is not 
described in the aforesaid patent ES 454234, although it is 
included within the scope of the general formula claimed in 
that patent. It has been found that the 3-[2-(1-(4'-piperonylpiperazinyl))indolyl]-carboxaldehyde, 
object of the  
 
present invention, possesses suprisingly interesting 
pharmacological properties, especially in the treatment of 
anxiety disorders, depression and as a memory stimulant. This invention also provides a pharmaceutical 
composition including a compound of formula (I) or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of same together with a 
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent. The composition is 
preferably presented in the form of tablets, capsules, 
injectable liquid, solution or suspension. The invention of formula (I) also provides a 
pharmaceutical compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt of same for use in the treatment of anxiety 
disorders, depression and as a memory stimulant. The compound of formula (I) can be obtained by two 
different procedures. In a general process (A), in 
accordance with this invention, it is obtained by 
nucleophilic replacement reaction of a leaving group X in 
position 2, such as chlorine, bromine, methanosulphonate or 
toluenesulphonate, of the indolic compound of formula (III) 
with piperonyl-piperazine (IV). 
The starting compound (III) is obtained from 2-oxoindole 
(V), by treatment with phosphorus oxychloride and 
N,N-dimethylformamide or N,N-dimethylacetamide in a 
chloroform medium, as can be found described in the 
li
