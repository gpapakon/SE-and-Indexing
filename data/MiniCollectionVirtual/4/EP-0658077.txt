<ABSTRACT>
A dual in-line package 12 for an integrated circuit 10 has 
pins 14 which engage the holes of a complementary socket 16, 

having two rows 16a and 16b. A portion of one row 16b is 
omitted, allowing the holes 22 of a cable connector 24 to engage 

the corresponding pins 20 of the package 12.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to integrated circuit packaging, 
and has particular relation to modems in a modular, replaceable 
package. Modem technology often advances faster than the technology 
which it supports. It therefore is desirable to retrofit 
existing electronic devices with new modems, or to use newly 
developed modems when manufacturing devices which have been in 
production for some time. Both activities are made easier by 
having a socket on the device into which the modem -- replacement 
or newly developed -- may be plugged. A socket, however, consumes a lot of space. Space, always 
in short supply in electronics, is in even shorter supply here, 
because a space-consuming interface connector (RS232, DAA, LED, 
or the like) must also be mounted on the device, to be connected 
to the socket and, through the modem, to interface with the 
device. From US-A-4 971 564 there is 
known a method of and apparatus for connecting electronic 
components, using the component pins for insertion in 
the end of insulated electrical wire. The pin and the 
electric conductor are held in galvanic contact by the 
insulation around the wire and a bracket is provided for 
holding wire ends in the correct configuration for receiving 
component leads. The present invention as claimed eliminates the need for the 
interface connector. The modem, in a dual in-line package, has 
pins which engage the holes of a complementary socket. A portion 
of the socket is omitted, allowing the holes of an external cable 
connector (not an interface connector) to engage the 
corresponding pins of the package directly.  
 One of the holes of the cable connector may be filled in, 
and the corresponding pin of the package omitted, to assure that 
the cable connector is attached to the proper pins of the 
package. Likewise, one of the holes of the socket may be filled 
in, and the corresponding pin of the package omitted, to assure 
that the package is properly attached to the socket. The package is particularly suited to housing a modem. It 
allows a cable, carrying telephone or other electronic signals 
and terminating in the cable connector, to mate with a 
motherboard mounting the socket. The portion of the motherboard 
opposite the pins for the cable connector is omitted, allowing 
access between the package and the cable connector. The packaged 
modem may be removed and replaced with a modem which is 
identically packaged, but upgraded. The identical packaging 
avoids the need to make any change in the cable connector, the 
socket,

<CLAIMS>
A combination comprising: 

(a) a package (12) for an integrated circuit, the package including 
a plurality of pins (14); 
(b) a socket (16) which includes means defining a plurality of 
holes (18), some of which are situated to engage complementary 

pins of the package; and 
(c) a cable connector (24) which includes means defining a 
plurality of holes (22), some of which are situated to engage 

complementary pins of the package, different from the pins 
situated to engage the holes of the socket. 
The combination of Claim 1, wherein at least one of the 
pins of the package is so situated that an inverting of 

the cable connector removes all holes of the cable 
connector from engaging with the pin. 
The combination of Claim 1, wherein at least one of the 
pins of the package is so situated that an inverting of 

the package removes all holes of the socket from engaging 
with the pin. 
The combination of Claim 3, wherein at least one of the 
pins of the package is so situated that an inverting of 

the cable connector removes all holes of the cable 
connector from engaging with the pin.  

 
The combination of Claim 1, further comprising a 
motherboard mounting the socket. 
The combination of Claim 5, further comprising means 
defining a hole in the motherboard opposite the pins 

complementary to the cable connector. 
The combination of Claim 6, wherein the integrated circuit 
comprises a modem. 
The combination of Claim 7, further comprising a cable 
attached to the cable connector. 
The combination of Claim 8, further comprising means 
defining a hole in the motherboard opposite the pins 

complementary to the cable connector.
