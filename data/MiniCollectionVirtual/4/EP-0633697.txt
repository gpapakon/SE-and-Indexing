In a video signal distribution system in which a plurality of video signals are 
modulated onto individual carrier signals spaced over a band of frequencies to form 

a composite signal for transmission over cables of the system, a point-to-point radio 
link forming part of the distribution system is provided in which the composite signal 

is transmitted as double side band amplitude modulation of a single microwave carrier 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video signal distribution systems, and in 
particular to such systems including point-to-point radio links. According to the invention in a video signal distribution system in which a 
plurality of video signals are modulated on respective sub-carriers of respective 
different frequencies spaced over a band of frequencies to form a wide-band composite 
signal for transmission along cables of the system, there is provided a microwave 
point-to-point radio link over which said composite signal is transmitted as double 
side-band amplitude modulation of a single microwave carrier signal. A video signal distribution system incorporating a microwave point-to-point 
radio link in accordance with the present invention will now be described with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:- 
Figure 1 shows schematically a transmitter station of the system, Figure 2 shows schematically in more detail one form of the up convertor or 
modulator of Figure 1, Figure 3 shows schematically in more detail a second form of the up convertor 
or modulator of Figure 1, Figure 4 shows schematically a receiver station of the system, Figure 5 shows schematically a return path transmitter of the system, and Figures 6 and 7 illustrate diagrammatically range/loss characteristics of the 
system. Referring first to Figure 1, the first part of the transmitter consists of a source 
of millimetre wave power sufficient to drive the modulator/upconverter. This may 
be a stabilised GUNN oscillator, synthesised source or any convenient method known  
 
to the art with stability and spectral purity adequate for the application. The source 
is to be provided with an electronic tuning port capable of frequency shift modulation 
up to the rate necessary for the return path application. The output of the source is 
taken via a low pass filter to limit the level of even order harmonics of the source 
frequency applied to the modulator. The modulator is shown in Figure 2. The input signal is split into two paths 
by means of a -3dB, 180° hybrid coupler. The carrier reference path is fed via a 
microwave isolator to the input port of a second reversed -3dB, 180° coupler. The 
modulation path takes the output from the second port of the first coupler and feeds 
this signal via a phase shifter and a level set attenuator to the balanced modulator. 
The modulator match is isolated from the modulation path by means of microwave 
isolators on its input and output ports. The modulation port of the modulator is fed
