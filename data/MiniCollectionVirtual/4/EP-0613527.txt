<CLAIMS>
Machine for exchanging energy between, on the one hand, 
a mechanical member which includes a mobile component (14, 61) 

having a rectilinear reciprocating movement and, on the other 
hand, a piston (9) co-operating with a cylinder (3) in order 

to transfer a fluid under pressure, with a connection of one 
of them to the mobile component (14) and a connection of the 

other to a fixed component (11), the connection of the piston 
including a joint (10) with two degrees of angular freedom, 

characterised in that the connection of the cylinder (3) also 
includes a joint with two degrees of angular freedom, such as 

a ball joint (7, 7', 10, 22, 22', 54, 73) or a Cardan joint 
(46). 
Machine as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that at 
least one of the joints also includes two degrees of freedom 

of displacement perpendicular to the rectilinear movement by 
means of surfaces which are perpendicular to this movement and 

offer mutual sliding support. 
Machine as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised 

in that the mobile component (14) forms part of a gearing 
consisting of a fixed ring gear which has internal teeth and 

co-operates with a planet gear of half size. 
Machine as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised 
in that the mobile component (54) forms part of a Watt linkage. 
Machine as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, with a 
first piston (3) which is movable in a fixed housing (1) and 

having a bore which co-operates with a fixed piston (9), 
characterised in that the first piston (3) is driven by two 

connecting rods (8, 8') which are connected by two ball joint 
(7, 7') and in that the fixed piston (9) is connected by a  

 
ball joint (10) to a wall (11) fixed on the housing (1). 
Machine as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the 
connecting rods (8, 8') are connected by two ball joints (16, 

16'), through the intermediary of a compensator (15), to a 
mobile component (14) having a rectilinear movement. 
Machine as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, characterised 
in that the first piston (3) and the housing (1) constitute a 

stage for transfer of fluid under pressure. 
Machine as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 7, characterised 
by a plurality of identical channels (18, 18') in the 

piston (3), connected to one another by circuits (20, 21) and 
each receiving a piston (19, 19') fixed by a ball joint (22, 

22') connected to a cylinder head (2) borne by the fixed 
housing (1). 
Machine as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 8, characterised 
in that the fixed piston (9) includes a bore which co-operates 

with a mobile piston (23) connected by a ball joint 
to a cylinder head (4) fixed on the first piston (3).
