Device for loading a weighing device, connected in 
series ahead of a packaging device, with fragile 

foodstuffs of irregular size and similar products, 
especially potato crisps (4), having 


a metering chute (1) with a delivery end (8), 
a weighing receptacle (3) and/or 
a fore-container (2) preceding the weighing container 
(3), 
 
characterised in that 


the metering chute (1) is closed at its delivery end 
(8) with a closing wall (9), 
on the delivery side (8) an outlet opening (10) is 
present in the bottom (5) of the metering chute (1), 
the size of the outlet opening (10) defines a maximum 
desired size relative to the size of the foodstuffs (4) 

to be weighed and packaged respectively, 
the bottom (5) of the metering chute (1) forms a 
perimeter region (11) around the outlet opening (10) 

and a support for foodstuffs (4) exceeding the desired 
size, 
at least one breaking device (12, 13) connected in 
series ahead of the weighing device arranged over the 

outlet opening (10) and both movable and controllable 
in the vertical direction, and 
means (26) for controlling the breaking device (12, 
13) are provided. 
Device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the breaking device (12, 13) is constructed as a 

plunger (12) operable directly or indirectly by driving 
means (13). 
Device according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that
  
 

the plunger (12) is restricted in its vertical path in 
the direction of the outlet opening (10) by the means 

(26) and/or a control device of the weighing device in 
such a way that excessively large foodstuffs (4) or 

similar products located on the outlet opening (10) are 
just evenly broken. 
Device according to one of the aforementioned claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the outlet opening (10) is round, oval, angular or 

shaped in a different manner. 
Device according to one of the aforementioned claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the section of the metering chute (1) containing the 

outlet opening (10) with the perimeter region (11), and 
the closing wall (9) forms a mouthpiece (14) which is 

detachable and replaceable with respect to the 
remainder of the metering chute (1). 
Device according to Claim 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the mouthpiece (14) can be connected to the metering 

chute (1) without tools by means of one or more quick-action 
closures (19) and/or by other fastening 

elements. 
Device according to Claim 5 or 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the metering chute (1) and/or the mouthpiece (14) is 

equipped with guide elements (16, 17, 18). 
Device according to one of the aforementioned claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the breaking device (12, 13) is fastened to a retaining 

element (20) arranged above the metering chute (1). 
Device according to Claim 8,
  
 

characterised in that
 
the retaining element (20) is straight, curved, closed 

in annular manner or shaped in another fashion. 
Device according to Claim 8 or 9,
 
characterised in that
 
the retaining element (20) disposes of means (27, 28) 

for the transmission of energy and/or is itself 
constructed as an energy carrier. 
Device according to one of Claims 8 to 10,
 
characterised in that
 
the retaining element (20) consists of several 

individual parts (21, 22) capable of connection to one 
another. 
Device according to Claim 11,
 
characterised in that
 
the individual parts (21, 22) of the retaining element 

(20) possess rigid, flexible, pivotable and/or 
rotatable or other types of fastening or coupling 

elements (23, 24) for establishing a linkage among 
themselves and/or additional adapters (29) for the 

means (27, 28) for the transmission of energy. 
Device according to one of Claims 8-12,
 
characterised in that
 
the retaining element (20) is a tube (21, 22).
