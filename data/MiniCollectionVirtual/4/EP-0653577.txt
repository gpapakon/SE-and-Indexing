<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of forming a
hydraulic damper. By hydraulic damper is meant a
suspension strut or shock absorber.A hydraulic damper for use in the suspension
system of a motor vehicle typically comprises a tube;
a piston sealably slidably mounted in the tube and
attached to a piston rod, the piston separating a
compression chamber from a rebound chamber within the
tube; a compression stroke valve mounted on the piston
which allows fluid flow from the compression chamber
to the rebound chamber; and a rebound stroke valve
mounted on the piston which allows fluid flow from the
rebound chamber to the compression chamber. The
piston rod extends out of the tube at one end thereof,
and is sealably slidably mounted in that one end.
Such hydraulic dampers either comprise an inner tube
and an outer tube (sometimes referred to as a twin
tube damper) in which the piston sealably slides in
the inner tube, or comprise a single tube (sometimes
referred to as a monotube damper).It is usual practice to form the or each
tube of a hydraulic damper by rolling a sheet of steel
and welding together the adjacent longitudinal edges.
External parts, such as the spring seat and the
mounting bracket or steering knuckle, which are also
formed from steel, are then welded to the single tube
or the outer tube. The other end of the tube is
sealed closed by welding on an end plate or by
arc-heating and rolling the tube end, and the internal
components of the suspension strut (such as those
mentioned above) are inserted into the tube by way of
the one end thereof, which is then sealed closed. The
use of several welding steps has disadvantages in that
welds are time consuming operations. Further, welds 
are susceptible to corrosion. Still further, the use
of steel has disadvantages with regard to weight.DE-U-1931028 discloses a method in
accordance with the preamble of claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
overcome one or more of the above mentioned
disadvantages.A method of forming a hydraulic damper in
accordance with the present invention comprises
extruding a tube of aluminium or aluminium alloy;
forming a mounting means of aluminium or aluminium
alloy; securing the mounting means to the extruded
tube; and closing an end of the extruded tube by flame
heating the end of the extruded tube and rolling the
flame heated end.This invention removes the steps of welding,
thereby removing time consuming operations. Further
the use of aluminium or aluminium alloy has advantages
with regard to weight when
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a hydraulic damper
comprising extruding a tube (12) of aluminium or

aluminium alloy; forming a mounting
means (46) of aluminium or aluminium alloy; and securing

the mounting means to the extruded tube; characterised by closing
an end (28) of the extruded tube by flame heating the

end of the extruded tube and rolling the flame heated
end.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein

the mounting means (46) is formed by extrusion.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
the mounting means (90) is formed by casting.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 3, wherein the mounting means (46) is formed with

a tubular portion (43) which overlies and is secured
to a portion of the extruded tube (12).
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein
the mounting means (46) is secured to the extruded

tube (12) by punching or pressing a tangentially
extending groove (47) in the tubular portion (43) and

the extruded tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein
the mounting means (90) is secured to the extruded

tube (12) by heating the tubular portion (92), placing
the tubular portion in the required position on the

extruded tube, and cooling the tubular portion to form
a frictional grip between the tubular portion and the

extruded tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein
the mounting means (70) is secured to the extruded

tube (12) by forming a screw thread (74,78) on the
extruded tube and in the tubular portion (76) and 

screw threading the tubular portion to the extruded
tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein
the mounting means (110) is secured to the extruded

tube (124) by applying adhesive between the tubular
portion (112) and the extruded tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 8,
comprising forming a number of circumferentially

extending grooves (130) of predetermined depth in the
extruded tube (124) and inserting the adhesive in the

grooves.
A method as claimed in Claim 9,
comprising forming two axially extending grooves (118)

in the inner surface of the tubular portion (112) and
forming a through hole (122) connecting with each

groove, wherein the adhesive is inserted through one
hole and one axial groove into the circumferential

grooves (130) in the extruded tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 4, wherein
the mounting means is secured to the extruded tube by

forming an external circumferentially extending bead
in the extruded tube, sliding the tubular portion onto

the extruded tube and into engagement with the bead,
and forming a second external circumferentially

extending bead in the extruded tube to trap the
tubular portion between the two beads.
A method as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 11, wherein the mounting means (46) is

formed to define a mounting bracket having at least
one arm (42) for securing the mounting bracket to a

motor vehicle.
A method as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 11, wherein the mounting means is formed

as a steering knuckle (90). 
A method as claimed in any
one of Claims 1 to 13, wherein the extruded tube (94)

has one or more external longitudinally extending ribs
(96,98) which engage with corresponding grooves

(100,102) formed in the mounting means (90) to locate
the mounting means on the extruded tube in a

predetermined position.
