<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of making a
hose coupling and a ferrule.It is known to make a hose coupling that
comprises a ferrule having opposed ends and an
insert interconnected to one of the ends of the
ferrule so that an end of a hose can be inserted
into the other of the ends of the ferrule and over
the insert to be subsequently clamped between the
ferrule and the insert the ferrule being formed by
radially inwardly deforming a tubular member,
as illustrated in US-A-4 653 779, which document is considered to be the closest prior art.It is one of the features of this
invention to provide a new method of making a
ferrule for a hose coupling wherein the ferrule can
be made from tubular stock in a simple and
effective manner.In particular, the prior known method of
making such a ferrule from tubular stock required
the making of dies that radially inwardly compress
a tubular member therebetween in order to form the
ferrule from the tubular member whereby a different
set of dies was required for each ferrule that had
a different diameter.However, it was found according to the
teachings of this invention that by merely rotating
a length of tubular stock and while the stock is
rotating, radially inwardly swedging a part thereof
in a desired location in a simple and effective 
manner, ferrules can be uniquely formed from such
rotating stock.Accordingly, it is an object of this
invention to provide a new method of making a hose
coupling.Another object of this invention is to
provide a new method of making a ferrule for a hose
coupling.These objects are realised by the subject-matter of the appended claims. The features of the invention, and its
technical advantages, can be seen from the
following description of the preferred embodiments,
together with the claims and the accompanying
drawings, in which:
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a
hose coupling ;FIG. 2 is a rear perspective view of the
hose coupling of FIG. 1;FIG. 3 is a schematic view illustrating
one of the steps of the method of
making the hose coupling of FIG. 1;FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 and
illustrates another step in the method
wherein rotating tubular stock is
radially inwardly swedged;FIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG. 4 and
illustrates how the swedged stock of FIG. 4 is
internally cut;FIG. 6 is a view similar to FIG. 5 and
illustrates another step
for finishing the outer peripheral
surface of a portion of the swedged tubular stock;FIG. 7 is a view similar to FIG. 6 and
illustrates how a portion of the swedged tubular
stock is cut

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a
ferrule (31, 31A) for a hose coupling (30, 30A)

that comprises said ferrule having opposed ends
(33, 34) and an insert (32, 32A) interconnected to

one of said ends of said ferrule (31, 31A) so that
an end (48) of a hose (49) can be inserted into the

other of said ends of said ferrule (31, 31A) and
over said insert (32, 32A) to be subsequently

clamped between said ferrule and said insert,
characterized by the steps of forming

said ferrule (31, 31A) from a length of tubular
stock (54, 54A) that has opposed ends by rotating

said stock, inwardly swedging said stock (54, 54A)
at a predetermined location (37, 37A) thereof that

is spaced inwardly from one end (55, 55A) of said
stock (54, 54A) to define said one end of said

ferrule (31, 31A) while said stock is rotating,
then forming the internal peripheral surface (36)

of said ferrule (31, 31A) to have a plurality of
radially inwardly directed annular projections (51,

51A), and then cutting off a portion (66, 66A) of
said stock (54, 54A) at a desired location thereon

that is spaced inwardly from said one end (55, 55A)
of said stock (54, 54A) to form said ferrule (31,

31A) so as to permit said stock to have another
ferrule formed therefrom in the same manner.
