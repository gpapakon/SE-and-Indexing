A system for producing liquid nitrogen (239,447) from a 
nitrogen-containing hydrocarbon stream (200,301) wherein excess 

refrigeration existing in a nitrogen rejection unit (Fig.1) or 
in an integrated nitrogen rejection unit-helium 

rejection unit system (Fig.2) is utilized to effectively 
generate a liquid nitrogen product stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to hydrocarbon 
processing employing nitrogen 
rejection systems integrated with a helium processing 
system. One problem often encountered in the production of 
natural gas from underground reservoirs is nitrogen 
contamination. The nitrogen may be naturally occurring 
and/or may have been injected into the reservoir as 
part of an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or enhanced gas 
recovery (EGR) operation. Natural gases which contain 
a significant amount of nitrogen may not be saleable, 
since they do not meet minimum heating value 
specifications and/or exceed maximum inert content 
requirements. As a result, the feed gas will generally 
undergo processing, wherein heavier components such as 
natural gas liquids are initially removed, and then the 
remaining stream containing primarily nitrogen and 
methane is separated cryogenically. A common process 
for separation of nitrogen from natural gas employs a 
single column or a double column distillation cycle 
wherein the feed is separated into a nitrogen-enriched 
vapor and methane-enriched liquid. Liquid nitrogen is a desirable product in that it 
may be employed to provide refrigeration for a process 
such as a freezing process, or may be stored for 
subsequent vaporization and use for inerting, 
nitrogenation or other purposes. The nitrogen 
generated as a result of a hydrocarbon nitrogen 
rejection operation is a convenient source of nitrogen.  
 
However, production and recovery of nitrogen as liquid 
is costly because considerable additional equipment is 
required to use excess refrigeration in the process to 
condense nitrogen without upsetting the stability and 
separation efficiency of the process. A method for producing nitrogen according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from 
US-A-4 878 932. The nitrogen-enriched vapor withdrawn from the column is warmed by 
indirect heat exchange by subsequently passing through three heat exchangers prior to being 
recovered as product. It is an object of this invention to 
provide a system for the production of liquid nitrogen 
which is effectively employed in conjunction with a 
hydrocarbon processing system using a nitrogen 
rejection unit. The above and other objects of which will become 
apparent to one skilled in the art upon a reading of 
this disclosure are attained by the present invention, 
one aspect of which is: A method for producing liquid nitrogen comprising: 
(A) passing a feed comprising nitrogen and methane into a column and separating the

(A) passing a feed (216, 316) comprising nitrogen and methane into a column (106, 
213) and separating the feed in the column into a nitrogen-enriched vapor (224, 

431) and a methane-enriched liquid (217, 222; 411, 414);
