<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is applied in the field of electrostatography, 
more specifically upon mixing an electrostatographic developer 
containing toner particles and carrier particles. In electrostatography a latent image is formed by (i) applying 
an imagewise charge distribution to a dielectric, (ii) developing 
the latent image, i.e. converting it in a visible image by 
depositing thereon selectively light-absorbing particles, called 
toner particles. The toner particles are mostly electrically 
charged. The image, made visible by the deposition of toner 
particles on the latent image that was present on the dielectric, is 
then transferred to a substratum and fixed thereon to yield the 
final copy. In electrophotography, which is a special embodiment of 
electrostatography, the dielectric is a photoconductor and an image 
is formed by (i) uniformly charging a photoconductor, (ii) imagewise 
discharging it so as to obtain a latent image, (iii) developing the 
latent image, i.e. converting it in a visible image by depositing 
toner particles on the latent image. The image, made visible by the 
deposition of toner particles on the latent image that was present 
on the photoconductor, is then transferred to a substratum and fixed 
thereon so as to yield the final copy. For the application of toner development two methods are known : 
"dry-powder" and "liquid-dispersion" development. At present the 
dry-powder method is the most commonly used. More details on the 
dry-powder development can be found a.o. in IEEE Transactions on 
Electronic Devices, Vol. ED-19, no. 4, April 1972, pp. 495-511. In the dry-powder process the toner particles are charged 
triboelectrically by mixing them, viz. shaking them together with 
the carrier particles (toner- and carrier particles have an opposite 
charge). The mixture of carrier particles and toner particles, that 
are attracted electrostatically by the carrier particles, is the 
developer. During development the toner particles are released by the 
carrier particles and deposited on the latent image that has been 
applied to a dielectric. The toner particles are thus the  
 
consumable in the developer. This implies that the developer gets 
exhausted upon being used, i.e. very few toner particles are left in 
the mixture with the carrier particles. For being able to continue 
developing latent image, toner has to be added. This fresh toner 
particles are still uncharged and have to be mixed (shaken) again in 
the apparatus with the carrier particles for charging them 
triboel
