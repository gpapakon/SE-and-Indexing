<ABSTRACT>
The snowplough described has a blade (1), which scrapes the snow up from the ground, and an upper plough element (2) with a flexible plate designed to deflect the stream of snow. The curvature of the flexible plate (3) can be adjusted by means of a mechanism (7.1, 7.2, 9, 11, 14, 40). The invention calls for the plate (3) to be held by the mechanism by means of a floating mounting (17). In this way, the plate (3) is not affected by direct internal stresses caused by temperature or other reasons. The flexible plate (3) is held at its upper and lower edge, the two edges being controlled so that they are always parallel to each other.

Snowplough having a flexible plate (3) which diverts
the snow mass and the curvature of which can be

adjusted with a mechanism, characterised in that the
mechanism (7.1, 7.2, 9, 11, 14, 40) holds the plate

(3) at its top edge and its bottom edge in a manner
such that it floats in the direction of the x and y

co-ordinates situated in its local plate plane, and
that the mechanism (7.1, 7.2, 9, 11, 14, 40) always

keeps the two edges parallel to one another, with the
result that during adjustment the position and

direction of the top edge of the plate (3) are always
predetermined in such a way that the bending force

essentially only operates locally perpendicularly to
the plate (30).
Snowplough according to claim 1, characterised in
that the mechanism includes a dual-lever system (11,

40) in which two levers (11, 40) of different lengths
and whose rotational axes (12, 19) are spaced apart

from one another predetermine the position and
direction of the top edge of the plate (3).
Snowplough according to claim 2, characterised in
that the mechanism (7.1, 7.2, 9, 11, 14, 40) includes

a hydraulic system (7.1, 7.2) which synchronously
actuates the two levers (11, 40) of the dual-lever

system.
Snowplough according to claim 3, characterised in
that at least two dual-lever systems are provided

which are adapted to be actuated with at least one
hydraulic cylinder in each case, and that the various

hydraulic cylinders are connected via flow dividers. 
Snowplough according to any of claims 1 to 4, having
a plough blade (1) which scrapes the snow from the

ground (25) and which is joined on beneath the
plough's upper part (2), characterised in that the

plough blade (1) has a plurality of individually
hinged elements (26) joined on laterally one

alongside the other.
Snowplough according to claim 5, characterised in
that the elements (26) are mounted in such a way that

whenever they hit an obstacle they turn around the
impact point and - without being lifted off the

ground - assume a negative position (D) in order to
then clear the obstacle.
Snowplough according to claim 5 or 6, characterised
in that the hinged elements (26) are respectively

mounted for rotation on a lever (28) which in the

rest position (C) is substantially horizontal and is
adapted to swivel vertically.
Snowplough according to claim 7, characterised in
that the element (26) is drawn into a positive rest

position (C) by a cable (34, 35, 36) whose point of
application is above the joint (27) between the lever

(28) and the element (26), and the cable includes a
deflection roller (35) and a substantially vertically

aligned spring (36).
Snowplough according to claim 7 or 8, characterised
in that the lever (28) is mounted in eccentric bushes

for precisely setting a gap (38) between the element
(26) and the plough's upper part (2).
Snowplough according to any of claims 5 to 9,
characterised in that the elements (26) are adapted

to be tilted slightly in the transverse direction, so 
as to enable them to adapt locally to the slope of

the ground.
Method for varying the curvature of a flexible plate
(3) which diverts the snow mass in the case of a

snowplough, the flexible plate (3) being adjustable
in its curvature by means of a mechanism,

characterised in that the plate (3) is held at its
top edge and its bottom edge in a manner such that it

floats in the direction of the x and y co-ordinates
in its local plate plane and that the two edges are

always kept parallel to one another, with the result
that during adjustment the position and direction of

the top edge of the plate (3) are always
predetermined in such a way that the bending force

essentially only operates locally perpendicularly to
the plate (3).
