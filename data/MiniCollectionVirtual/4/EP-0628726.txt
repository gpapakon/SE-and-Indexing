<ABSTRACT>
A primary vane pump suitable for an aircraft jet engine 
fuel pump has a rotor with vanes, and an intermediate casing, 

which is also rotatable, both mounted in a fixed housing. The 
rotor vanes are enclosed in the casing and provide a primary 

pumping stage. The intermediate casing has outer vanes enclosed 
with the fixed housing, which provide a governor stage vane pump 

when the casing rotates. An inlet annulus supplies fuel to 
passages in the rotatable casing leading to the primary pumping 

stage and other passages in the rotatable casing conduct pumped 
fluid out to a discharge annulus. A closed fluid loop is 

established from discharge annulus to the governor stage vane 
pump, out through a valve and back to the discharge annulus. 

The reaction on the casing caused by the primary pump rotor 
tends to rotate the intermediate casing, while pressure drop 

through the valve in the closed fluid loop resists rotation. 
Adjustment of the valve adjusts rotational speed of the 

intermediate casing and varies the delivery rate of fuel by the 
primary vane pump.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to positive displacement, 
variable delivery pumping apparatus of the vane pump-type driven 
by either a constant speed or a varying speed power source and 
delivering controlled variable flow of a pumped liquid, such as 
fuel. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved 
two stage vane pump apparatus for delivering fuel to an aircraft 
jet engine or gas turbine at a controllable fuel flow rate which 
is independent of the driven speed of the pump. Typically, liquid fuel is pumped to a gas turbine, such as a 
jet aircraft engine, using positive displacement, variable 
delivery pumping apparatus. Such positive displacement pumps 
have included gear pumps, vane pumps and piston pumps. Variable 
delivery has been achieved by changing the geometry of the 
positive displacement pump or by bypassing liquid to the inlet,  
 
both of which decrease the overall efficiency and require power 
as the flow is varied. As gas turbine engine technology advances, engine 
manufacturers are requiring fuel systems which are light, 
compact, very efficient, and preferably operate from a single 
fuel demand control signal without regard for speed of the 
engine, and suitable for driving by any power source, i.e., the 
engine itself or a dedicated motor. For example the fuel needs 
of an aircraft jet engine are quite different during takeoff and 
during high altitude cruising. Two stage pumping arrangements for jet engine fuel are also 
known which are combined with various accessory apparatus to 
meet the particular requirements of aircraft jet engines, which 
involve a large number of hydromechanical accessory devices in 
the overall fuel control system. All of the above add to the 
cost. It would be desirable to have a simplified positive 
displacement, variable delivery pumping apparatus which provides 
for variable flow of the pumped liquid suitable for either 
constant speed or variable speed drive and without the need to 
change the geometry of the pump hardware. Furthermore it would 
be desirable to have an improved variable delivery, positive  
 
displacement pumping apparatus which will operate without 
bypassing flow back to the inlet using simplified controls. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved positive displacement, variable delivery 
pumping apparatus which provides variable flow with simplified 
controls and more efficiently than existing pumping apparatus. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved 
fuel
