<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a base film having a
high dimensional stability which can be advantageously used
as a support for an original film for a photomechanical
process, an original film for a printed circuit board, etc.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a base
film further having high transparency, i. e., an excellent
light transmission in the near ultraviolet region. The
present invention also relates to a photographic light-sensitive
material comprising such a base film.As a support for an original film for a
photomechanical process, an original film for a printed
circuit board (PCB), etc. (hereinafter sometimes simply
referred to as a "support"), a polyethylene terephthalate
film having a relatively good dimensional stability against
the variation of relative humidity (hereinafter sometimes
abbreviated as "humidity") or temperature has been used.
This is because an original film for a photomechanical
process is liable to cause color drift in the lamination of
four colors, i.e., cyan, magenta, yellow and black, when the
positions of the exposure of the films are deviated from each
other due to the variation of humidity or temperature. In 
the case of an original film for a printed circuit board, if
image drift occurs due to the variation of humidity or
temperature when printed circuit boards obtained by the
exposure of these films are laminated on another, drilling
for making through-hole may damage the circuit.A polyethylene terephthalate film exhibits a
relatively small dimensional change against the variation of
humidity or temperature among high molecular films.
Nevertheless, it is inevitably liable to cause some
dimensional change. Thus, it is necessary that an original
film for a photomechanical process, an original film for a
printed circuit board, etc. be used in a special room that is
considerably finely controlled to a humidity of about from 55
to 60 %RH and a temperature of from 20 to 27Â°C all the time
and these films be exposed in this working atmosphere for a
prolonged period of time, so that they are moisture- and
temperature-conditioned. This drastically reduces the
working efficiency.JP-A-5-289236 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means
an unexamined published Japanese patent application) corresponding to EP-A-0 549 028 proposes
a photographic light-sensitive material comprising at least
one hydrophilic image pre-colored layer on a support having a
barrier layer made of SiOx (in which x is in the range of
from 1.2 to 1.8) provided on a hydrophobic polyester
