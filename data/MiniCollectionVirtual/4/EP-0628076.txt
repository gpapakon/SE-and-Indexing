<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a method for producing a recombinant protein having a preselected binding affinity and specificity for a given antigen. Generally, the method combines spleen fragment culture for the in vitro somatic mutation of B cells in response to antigen, followed by preferential amplification of RNA encoding heavy and light chains of desired antibodies produced by those B cells. The amplified RNA is then converted to DNA and incorporated into expression vectors; transfected host cells then express the antibody chains or a single chain antibody having preselected characteristics. Also disclosed are generic degenerate primer pools for the efficient amplification of RNA encoding mouse IgG.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PRODUCTION OF MONOCLONAL RECOMBINANT ANTIBODIES WITHOUT THE USE OF HYBRIDOMAS BY IN VITRO SPLEEN FRAGMENT CULTURE COMBINED WITH ISOTHERMAL SELF-SUSTAINED SEQUENCE REPLICATION OF RNAThis is a continuation of US patent application serial number 07/978,835, filed November 19, 1992.Portions of the research described in this application were supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, and the U.S. government may have certain rights in this invention.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to methods for the production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. The methods of the instant invention are based oh in vitro spleen fragment culture of B cells which produce monoclonal antibodies combined with the technique known as isothermal self-sustained sequence replication (3SR) , which amplifies RNA encoding the antibodies of interest. The invention also relates to generic degenerate primer pools for use in replication of RNA encoding monoclonal antibodies of interest.Background of the inventionMonoclonal antibodies are used in therapy, diagnostics, and basic research. For in vivo therapy, monoclonal antibodies are directed against a toxin or a tumor surface antigen to mount the patient's immune response against the targeted toxin or pathogenic cell. Alternatively, a monoclonal antibody may be conjugated with a toxin, thereby directing the toxic action to the tumor cell. Ex vivo. or extracorporeal immuno-therapy 

 involves the removal of the patien 's bone marrow or blood and isolation of a selected cell population by means of binding a predetermined antigen on the cells' surface with a monoclonal antibody against that cell surface antigen. The monoclonal antibody may be chemically bound to magnetic beads which facilitate the removal of the cells bound to the antibody. Depending on the type of therapy being administered, the isolated cells may be discarded or they may be returned to the patient at a later date. Isolation of hemopoietic cells also offers the possibility of genetic manipulation of the patient's cells to correct a genetic defect or to expand a desired population of hemopoietic cells, which are thereafter returned to the patient. Immunodiagnostic tests are based on the generation of a signal proportional to the extent of binding of a monoclonal antibody to a specific substance (antigen) in a patient's blood or tissue.Immunotherapy and reproducible immunodiagnostic tests require antibodies of standardized specificity and affinity for the antigen of interest.
