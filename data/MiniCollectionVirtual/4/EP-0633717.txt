<ABSTRACT>
A printed circuit, masked in accordance with an image with a solder resist mask, is described whose surface has been reacted with an organic silyl compound. The reaction with the silyl compound takes place after the solder resist mask has been generated and cured. This treatment improves the resistance of the circuit to corrosion by air humidity and prevents the accumulation of solder metal beads and threads on the surface of the mask.
