<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to heat
exchangers for motor vehicles and, more specifically, to a
folded tube and method for making same for a heat exchanger
in a motor vehicle.It is known to provide a tube for a heat exchanger such
as a condenser in an air conditioning system of a motor
vehicle. The tube typically carries a first fluid medium in
contact with its interior while a second fluid medium
contacts its exterior. Typically, the first fluid medium is
a liquid and the second fluid medium is air. Where a
temperature difference exists between the first and second
fluid mediums, heat will be transferred between the two via
heat conductive walls of the tube.It is also known to provide corrugated fins or ribs in
the interior of the tube to increase the surface area of
conductive material available for heat transfer to cause
turbulence of the fluid carried in the interior of the tube
and to increase the burst strength of the tube. One known
method of making such a tube is to physically insert a
corrugated fin into the generally flattened tube after the
tube has been manufactured. This is an extremely difficult
process since the corrugated fin to be inserted into the
tube is extremely thin and subject to deformation during the
insertion process.Another known method of forming a tube for a heat
exchanger is to extrude the tube in an extrusion process.
In this construction, internal ribs are formed during the
extrusion. However, these extruded tubes are relatively
expensive to produce.Yet another known method of forming a tube for a heat
exchanger is to provide a flat, elongated sheet with lugs
and the ends of the sheet are folded to form the tube. The
ends of the tube are then brazed. An example of such a tube
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,386,629. In this 
construction, the tube may have flow paths between the lugs
having a hydraulic diameter of less than 0.050 inches.
Hydraulic diameter is conventionally defined as the cross-sectional
area of each of the flow paths multiplied by four
and divided by a wetted perimeter of the corresponding flow
path. While a hydraulic diameter of less than 0.050 inches
optimises heat transfer efficiency, it is relatively
expensive to produce.Although the above tubes have worked well, they suffer
from the disadvantage that the extruded tubes are relatively
costly to manufacture. Another disadvantage of the above
tubes is that the lugs are not folded and squeezed. Yet
another disadvantage of the above tubes is that the
hydraulic diameter of the flow paths are
