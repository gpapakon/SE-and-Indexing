A connector system for connecting liquid containers, in particular such containers 
holding medical liquids, and for connecting one of said containers with a transfer set or 

another container, said connector system being provided with first and second connector 
means (1, 2) so as to maintain the predetermined connection sequence, each connector 

means having a first connector (1A, 2A) designed for connection with the connector 
of a particular liquid container, and a second connector (1B, 2B),
 
as well as
 
an intermediate member (3) with two interconnected connectors (3A, 3B), the first (3A) 

of which is adapted to be releasably connected to the second connector (1B) of a first 
connector (1B) of a first connector means (1) and to a connector member (6) of a 

transfer set and the second (3B) of which is adapted to be permanently connected to the 
second connector (2B) of the second connector means (2), the intermediate member (3) 

being adapted to be disposed inside the first connector means (1) and terminating 
substantially flush with the second connector (1B) thereof. 
The connector system of claim 1, characterized in that a nonreturn valve (4) is 
arranged in said intermediate member (3), said valve allowing a liquid flow from said 

first (3A) to said second connector (3B) of said intermediate member (3), yet blocks the 
flow in the opposite direction. 
The connector system of claim 2, characterized in that said nonreturn valve (4) may 
forcibly be opened against its blocking effect when connecting said first connector (3A) 

of said intermediate member (3) and a further container (BIII) or a transfer set, thereby 
allowing a liquid flow from said second connector (3B) to said first connector (3A).  

 
The connector system of one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said first and 
second connectors (1A;2A, 3A, 1B, 2B, 3B) of said first and/or second connector 

means (1, 2) and/or said intermediate member (3) are disposed coaxially. 
The connector system of one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the connection 
between said second connector (1B) of said first connector means (1) and said first 

connector (3A) of said intermediate member (3) is arranged as a threaded connection. 
The connector system of one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the connection 

between said second connector (2B) of said second connector means (2) and said 
second connector (3B) of said intermediate member (3) is arranged as a snap-in connection. 
The connector system of one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that said first connector 
(3A) of said intermediate member (3) is provided on its outer surface for connection 

to said second connector (1B) of said first connector means (1) and has its inner 
surface designed as a female Luer cone for connection to a further container (BIII) or 

a conduit connector with a male Luer cone. 
The connector system of claims 2 and 7, characterized in that said nonreturn valve 
(4) of said intermediate member (3) is disposed in the receiving portion of the male 

Luer cone and is opened by the same upon connection of a further container (BIII) or 
a conduit connector.
