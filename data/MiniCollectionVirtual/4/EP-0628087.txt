<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method relating to the manufacturing of steel strips, comprising continuous treatment of the steel strip in an annealing furnace (7) at a temperature exceeding the recrystrallization temperature of the steel. The steel strip (4A) is fed into the annealing furnace at a certain feeding-in rate and is drawn out of the furnace at another, higher feeding-out rate, wherein the steel strip is subjected to a pulling force in the annealing furnace at said temperature exceeding the creep limit of the steel at said temperature, resulting in a permanent stretch (elongation) of the steel strip corresponding to the difference between the feeding-out and feeding-in rates, and in a reduction of the cross section of the strip corresponding to the elongation, including a reduction of the strip thickness as well as of the strip breadth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method relating to the manufacturing of steel
strips, comprising continuous treatment of the steel strip in an
annealing furnace at a temperature between 1000°C and 1250°C.The rolling of steel strips usually is carried out from several
reasons. A primary objective is to afford the steel strip a desired
thickness. The rolling usually is performed as hot rolling down to a
thickness in the dimension range 1-12 mm, preferably 1-6 mm, whereupon
continued reduction of the thickness to desired final thickness is
performed through cold rolling. In connection with the cold rolling,
usually one or more annealing operations are included for the
recrystallization of the steel structure.In connection with this technique, it is difficult to achieve the
desired final thickness in a simple and practical way.Another problem concerns the breadth of the strip. The end product
shall have a certain desired strip breadth, which must at least be
reached. In order to meet with this requirement it is conventional to
use, as starting material for the cold rolling operation, hot rolled
strips having a breadth which substantially exceeds the desired final
breadth. This implies that larger amounts of edge scrap is formed at
the manufucturing than what is required for the more or less
unavoidable conditioning of the edges of the strip. The formation of
this scrap material from the edge portions, which is due to poor
adaptation of the breadth of the raw strips to the breadth required by
the customer and also due to the fact that there are no possibilities
to adjust the breadth of the strips in the cold roll mills, represents
very large losses.SU-A-384903 discloses correction of strip geometry by heating a steel strip to recrystallization point under tension to obtain a longitudinal extension of 0.2-1.5 %.DE-A-1 260 798 discloses continuous heat treatment of a
metal strip in a furnace comprising plastic elongation of
the strip obtained by a feeding-out velocity that is
higher than the feeding-in velocity. The purpose of the invention is to solve the above mentioned problems.
This can be achieved therein that the invention is characterised in by
what is stated in the appending claims. The method of the invention
has been developed particularly for austenitic stainless steels but
can be used also for other steel grades, stainless as well as other
alloyed steels, and also for carbon steels. The principles of the
invention per se also can be utilized for the manufacturing of metal
strips, which do not consist of

<CLAIMS>
Method of manufacturing steel strips, to obtain a desired breath of the strip by controlling the pulling force in
continuous treatment of the steel strip in an annealing furnace (7)

at a temperature exceeding the recrystallization temperature of the
steel, wherein the steel strip (4A) is fed

into the annealing furnace at a certain feeding-in rate and is drawn
out of the furnace at another, higher feeding-out rate, and wherein the

steel strip is subjected to a pulling force in the annealing furnace
at said temperature exceeding the creep limit of the steel at

said temperature, resulting in a permanent stretch (elongation) of the
steel strip connesponding to the difference between the feeding-out

and feeding-in rates, and in a reduction of the cross section of the
strip corresponding to the elongation, including a reduction of the

strip thickness as well as of the strip breadth.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the
steel strip is subjected to the said pulling tension at a temperature

between 1000° and 1250°C.
Method according to claim 2, 
characterised
 in that the
steel strip is subjected to the said pulling tension at a temperature

between 1080° and 1200°C.
Method according to any of claims 1-3, 
characterised

in that the strip after hot rolling is subjected to at least one cold
rolling operation causing a first strip thickness reduction before the

strip is subjected to said continuous annealing and stretching in the
annealing furnace resulting in a second thickness reduction.
Method according to claim 4 for the production of strips having a
certain desired breadth and thickness, 
characterised
 in
that the strip is continuously stretched so much in the annealing

furnace that the breadth of the strip is reduced to a certain final
breadth at the same time as said second thickness reduction is

achieved, and that the strip is worked in the preceding cold rolling
operation to an extent depending on the finishing second thickness 

reduction, so that the total thickness reduction achieved through the
cold rolling and through the elongation in the annealing furnace

affords the strip a thickness after annealing which corresponds to the

desired strip thickness of the end product.
