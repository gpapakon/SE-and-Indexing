<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a two-piece golf ball comprising a 
core comprising a rubber composition of a base rubber, 

a co-crosslinking agent and an organic peroxide, and a 
cover. The core of the golf ball contains 20 to 30 

parts by weight of the co-crosslinking agent based on 
100 parts by weight of the base rubber. The hardness 

of the core, measured by a JIS-C type hardness tester, 
is within a range of from 70 to 80 at any part from 

the center to the surface and a difference in hardness 
at any part is not more than 5. The amount of 

compression deformation of the core formed between 
initial loading (10 kg) and final loading (130 kg) is 

3.1 to 3.8 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two-piece golf 
ball. More particularly, it relates to a two-piece golf 
ball having excellent shot feel. A two-piece golf ball has widely been used because 
of its excellent flight performances. However, there is 
a problem that shot feel of the two-piece golf ball is 
hard in comparison with a thread wound golf ball and it 
exhibits a harder feeling when it is mis-hit. 
Therefore, two-piece golf balls having an excellent shot feel 
are a desiratum. Recently, various efforts have been made in order to 
obtain a shot feel which is similar to that of the thread 
wound golf ball. For example, the shot feel may be 
improved by softening the core of the two-piece golf ball 
to decrease the total hardness of the ball. 
However, the golf ball obtained by this method lacks a 
suitable hardness distribution in the core. Further, 
the golf ball feels soft but exhibits a heavy feeling 
and, therefore, it does not necessarily have a shot 
feel which is similar to that of the thread wound golf 
ball. GB-A-2127303 relates to a two-piece solid golf ball. Under these circumstances, the present inventors 
have paid attention to the hardness distribution of the  
 
core and compression strength and studied intensively 
about them. As a result, it has been found that, by 
making the hardness distribution of the core uniform 
within a range from the center to the surface, adjusting 
the compression strength of the core and optimizing both 
of these, it has become possible to obtain a suitable softness of the 
core and a suitable hardness of the cover, thereby affording a 
two-piece golf ball which is soft and superior in shot 
feel and which has excellent flight distance in 
comparison with a conventional golf ball. As a matter of 
course, the resulting two-piece golf ball has a long flight 
distance when hit with an iron and has excellent 
control properties. That is, the main object of the present invention is 
to provide a two-piece golf ball having a shot feel 
which closely approaches that of a thread wound golf 
ball by controlling the characteristics of the core of the 
two-piece golf ball. This object as well as other objects and advantages 
of the present invention will become apparent to those 
skilled in the art from the following description. The present invention provides a two-piece golf 
ball comprising a core comprising a rubber composition 
of a base rubber, a co-crosslinking agent and an 
organic peroxide, and a cover covering the core, the 
core containing 20 to 30
