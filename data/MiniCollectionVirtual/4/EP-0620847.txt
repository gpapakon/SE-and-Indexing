<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made in the course of research
sponsored by the NIH grant number NS18616. The Government
has certain rights in this invention.Mature mammalian neurons are incapable of cell
division and cannot, with the exception of olfactory
neurons, be generated from stem cells in the adult nervous
system. Thus, continuous dividing clonal cell lines with
neuronal characteristics have proven to be very useful to
neurobiologists studying almost every aspect of the nervous
system. Such cell lines allow the generation of large
numbers of homogeneous cells and the manipulation of these
cells through gene transfer to yield novel derivatives
expressing foreign gene products. These advantages have
led to the development and characterization of a variety of
neuronal cell lines, some of which have been useful for
cell biological, biochemical, and molecular biological
studies. The utility of these different cell lines and
their ability to approximate aspects of the neuronal
phenotype vary widely. However, studies conducted over the
past decade have shown that the usefulness of a cell line
primarily depends on two characteristics: 1) the extent to
which a particular cell line resembles post-mitotic
neurons; and 2) the doubling time. Frequently, these two
key characteristics are inversely related. Many
differentiated properties of neurons are not fully
articulated in vivo until the stem cell becomes
post-mitotic. However, rapidly dividing neuronal cell 
lines usually do not possess the phenotypic properties of
terminally differentiated non-dividing neurons, instead,
they often resemble in vivo neuroblasts or embryonic
neurons. For example, many of these cell lines elaborate
immature neurites with an immature cytoskeleton but lack
most of the morphology and neuritic differentiation of
post-mitotic neurons. Nevertheless, since they divide
rapidly, these cell lines are useful for biochemical and
transfection experiments. Naturally occurring neoplastic
derivatives of many neuronal cell types of the central
(CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems usually fall in
this category (e.g., neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas and
medulloblastomas). At the other end of the spectrum are
cell lines exemplified by HCN 1 (Ronnett et al., 1990,
Science, 248:603-605). These cells have many
characteristics of differentiated neurons, but they divide
so slowly (i.e., doubling time of 72 hours when
undifferentiated) that they are not amenable to many
experimental manipulations. Even PC 12 cells, the classic
example of a neuronal cell
