<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
magneto-optic recording mediums, and more particularly
to a magneto-optic recording medium which is suited for
the so-called mark edge recording system.When recording information on a magneto-optic
recording medium, marks of inverted magnetic domains
are formed on the magneto-optic recording medium by use
of a recording laser beam and an external magnetic
field. In addition, when reproducing information from
the magneto-optic recording medium, the recorded
information is read by use of a deflected reproducing
laser beam and utilizing the magneto-optic effect.Recently, due to the demands to improve the
information recording density of the magneto-optic
recording mediums, there are demands to use a
semiconductor laser which outputs a laser beam having a
short wavelength as a light source of the recording
laser beam and to employ the mark edge recording
system.Presently, the wavelength of the laser beam
used for recording information on a magneto-optic disk
is 780 nm or 830 nm, for example. If the wavelength of
the recording laser beam is set to the short
wavelength, it is possible to make the recording marks
formed on the magneto-optic disk small and accordingly,
improve the recording density of the magneto-optic
disk. Hence, it may be regarded that a high density
recording can be realized by use of a laser beam which
has a wavelength of approximately 680 nm and is about
to be reduced to practice. However, the magneto-optic
disk which is reduced to practice at the present is
made on the precondition that the recording laser beam
used has a wavelength in a vicinity of 800 nm. For 
this reason, even if the wavelength of the recording
laser beam is simply reduced to 680 nm, for example,
there were problems in that the magneto-optic effect
obtained will become small and that the quality of
signals recorded on the magneto-optic disk will
deteriorate.According to the mark edge recording system,
the edge of the recording mark formed on the magneto-optic
disk corresponds to information (data) value "1".
Hence, compared to the conventional so-called mark
position recording system according to which the
recording mark itself formed on the magneto-optic disk
corresponds to the data value "1", the mark edge
recording system can record the information on the
magneto-optic disk with a higher density. It is
conceivable to apply the mark edge recording system to
the existing magneto-optic disk, however, no such
magneto-optic disk has been reduced to practice at the
present
