<ABSTRACT>
In a slide projector having a chute (37) for feeding the 
slides (21, 24) to be projected to the projection gate and 

also having a stack loader (9) with a first and a second 
storage chamber (17 and 19), each to take a stack of slides 

which are in contact with one another, the stack loader (9) 
has a movable receiving member (31) with two slide 

compartments (35 and 36), said receiving member serving as a 
movable intermediate tray whose slide compartments can be 

selectively aligned with the opening of the chute (37) and 
can be selectively loaded and unloaded again with an end 

slide (21, 24) of the stack of slides in one of the storage 
chambers (17 or 19) by transport means (47, 49, 61, 63).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a slide projector with a chute for
feeding a slide to be projected to the projection gate, a
projector drive for actuating a movable arm for ejecting the
slide in the chute out of said chute, a stack loader adapted
to be mounted above the opening of the chute and having a
first and second storage chamber each to hold a stack of
slides which are in contact with one another, a feeding
device for pushing the stack of slides in at least one of
the storage chambers relative to the opening of the chute
and into a position in which the end slide of the stack is
movable out of said storage chamber as the slide to be
projected and into the chute and in which a projected slide
is movable out of the chute by the arm and into the other
storage chamber.Slide projectors with a chute to feed the slides to the
projection gate under the effect of gravity and with a
driven arm to move the slide out of the upper opening of the
chute are already known. Such projectors are frequently
operated in conjunction with a circular tray mounted on top
of the projector which has slide compartments open on the
underside and which can be aligned with the chute, see
US-PS 3 276 314.A known slide projector of the generic type, see
DE-AS 1 285 205, offers the user the possibility of
projecting slides automatically without previously having to
load the slides into a slide tray. With this known projector
it is only necessary to place a stack of slides which are in
contact with one another into the one storage chamber of the
stack loader which is mounted above the chute instead of a
tray. When the slides have been projected, the stack of
slides can then be taken out of the second storage chamber
of said loader.Although this known projector relieves the user of the
necessity for loading the slides into a tray, a projector of 
this type has certain limitations with respect to its
universal applicability. For example, it is not possible to
project the slides "backwards", as slides already projected
and loaded into the second storage chamber cannot be
projected a second time without being taken out of the
second storage chamber and placed into the first storage
chamber again. The above known projector is not suitable
either for the projection of slides of different
thicknesses, for example slides with different mounts.It is the object of the invention to create a slide
projector of the type in question which, in contrast to such
known projectors, is characterised by universal
applicability.This object is attained

stack loader (9) adapted to be mounted above the
opening of the chute and having a first and second

storage chamber (17 and 19) each to hold a stack of
slides which are in contact with one another, a feeding

device (27, 28) for pushing the stack of slides in
one of the storage chambers relative to the

opening of the chute (37) into a position in which
the end slide (21, 24) of the stack is movable out of

said storage chamber
into the chute (37) as a slide to be projected and for moving a projected slide

out of the chute (37) by the arm into the

other storage chamber, characterized in that the stack
loader (9) has a slide receiving member (31) which

is designed in the form of a segment
of a circular tray rotatably movable about a central journal

(3) of the projector by means of a drive element (5)
of the projector drive, and which

comprises a first and a second slide
compartment (35, 36) open on the underside

relative to the chute (37) and the projector drive in
order to alternatively align the opening in the bottom of the

slide compartments (35, 36) with the opening of the
chute (37); and in that slide transport means (47, 49, 61, 63)

are provided which are controllable in response to the
movement of the receiving member (31), wherein

the receiving member is rotatably movable about said
central journal between:
a first position in which the end slide of
the stack to be projected in the first storage chamber

(17, 19) can be inserted by the slide transport means (47, 49,
61, 63) in the first slide compartment (35, 36) 

and the second slide compartment (35, 36)
has its opening aligned with the chute so that a

projected slide ejected by the movable arm from the
chute can be received in the second slide

compartment (35, 36), and
a second position in which the first
slide compartment (35, 36) has its opening

aligned with the chute so that said end slide to be
projected can drop under the effect of the gravity

into the chute and the projected slide in the second
slide compartment (35, 36) can be removed by

the slide transport means (47, 49, 61, 63) from said second
slide compartment (35, 36) and returned

as end slide to the stack in the second storage chamber
(17, 19).
