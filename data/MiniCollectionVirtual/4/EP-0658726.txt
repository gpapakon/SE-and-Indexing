<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiator consisting of a plate-like base material with a very low heat conductivity, on which at least one electric heater element is deposited, on which a heat-reflecting foil is deposited, on which a heat-insulating mat (5) is situated. The radiator is characterised in that the base material (1) consists of natural stone, fireclay, ceramic or the like, on which the electric heating foil (2) is deposited, the foil being joined to a plastic sheet (4) with deposited metal layer as fixed component of the heating foil, and in that the base material is surrounded by an edge band (6) made of the same material, which forms a natural heat barrier against unnecessary heating of the control electronics (3) mounted on the rear side and of the region of the operating elements.
