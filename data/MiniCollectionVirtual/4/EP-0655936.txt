<ABSTRACT>
Described is a pressure filter with a liquid space having a liquid feed inlet and at least one filter surface with a multiplicity of apertures, one side of the filter surface being bounded by the liquid space while the other side is bounded by a filtrate space with a filtrate discharge outlet, the device also having a back-flushing device. The back-flushing device has a head which passes over the filter surface and seals off part of the filter surface with respect to the liquid space. The back-flushing head delimits a back-flushing space with at least one suction chamber which presents a slit-like opening towards the filter surface and to which a reject line is connected. The slit-like opening of the suction chamber is designed in such a way that each aperture in the filter surface is passed over by the slit-like opening approximately for the same length of time, irrespective of its radial position. This ensures uniform cleaning of the filter surface by the back-flushing head.

A pressure filter comprising a fluid compartment (21)
with a fluid inlet (18), two parallel circular filter

elements (12) having a plurality of apertures and
having one side restricted by the fluid compartment

(21) and another side restricted by a filtrate
compartment, the filtrate compartment having a

filtrate outlet (19), and a backwashing means with a
backwashing head sweeping over the filter element (12)

and sealing a part of the filter element (12) with
respect to the fluid compartment (21), the backwashing

head restricting a backwashing compartment having a
suction chamber with a slot-like opening open to the

filter element (12) and having connected thereto a
reject drain (25) so that each aperture of the filter

element (12), independent of its radial position, is
swept over by the slot-like opening in approximately

the same period of time, characterized in that the
backwashing head is formed by a plurality of hollow

slats (8) formed as a semi-arc of a helix and carried
by a carrier plate (5) with recesses between the

hollow slats (8), that the fluid compartment (21) is
disposed axially outside of the filter element (12),

and that the hollow slats (8) are resiliently pressed
against the axially outer side of the filter element

(12) adjacent to the housing (3). 
The pressure filter according to claim 1,
characterized in that the slot-like opening has the

form of a semi-arc of a helix of about 190Â°.
The pressure filter according to claim 1,
characterized in that the slot-like opening is formed

by a plurality of helically disposed and adjacent
linear single slots (30).
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the reject drain from

the backwashing compartment extends through a hollow
shaft (9) for driving the backwashing head and from

there out of the filter.
The pressure filter according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the hollow slats (8)

have a suction part on the side of the carrier plate
(5) adjacent to the filter surface and a reject drain

part (7) on the side of the carrier plate facing away
from the filter surface.
