<ABSTRACT>
In a method for controlling a burner (2) for a burner-operated furnace installation, which burner can be switched over in a stepped or modulating manner with regard to output, for controlling the residual oxygen content by means of an O2 probe (8) in the outgoing gas (7), a control device (9) with a PID control is used. The control parameters for the PID control are calculated individually for the existing output steps of the burner (2) from measurements of step responses on the open control circuit. From the control deviation, the PID control calculates an output-independent manipulated variable which contains an output-independent integral part. The output-independent manipulated variable is subsequently multiplied by an output-dependent system gain. An actuator, for example an air flap (6), is controlled from output-independent manipulated variable and output-dependent system gain according to the product. In switching over from a first output step to a second output step, the output-independent integral part of the output-independent manipulated variable is used as the starting value for the output-independent manipulated variable during operation of the burner (2) on the second output stage. By means of the use of the PID control and the introduction of the output-independent manipulated variable, a reduction in the harmful substances produced is achieved and energy losses are decreased on switching over of the burner (2) between the output steps.

modulating mode, comprising: 

an O
