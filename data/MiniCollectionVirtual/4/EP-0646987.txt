<ABSTRACT>
The connection assembly comprises a duct open at a front end, an insulation-displacement contact with front and rear IDC tines (forks) in the duct and a front pusher mounted so as to slide in the duct and onto the contact. It is characterized in that the contact (4) can move between a pushed-down position and a raised position in the duct (1) and in that the duct (1) includes, transversely to the contact, in its rear terminal part, a conductor input (14). Application: connection of telephone lines.

A connection device including firstly an insulation-displacement
contact (4) having a "front" insulation-displacement fork (10) and a

"rear" insulation-displacement fork (11) at respective opposite ends
of the contact, which contact is mounted in a sleeve (1) that is open

at a "front" end and that is provided with a conductor inlet (17) for
receiving a conductor to be connected to said rear insulation-displacement

fork (11), and secondly a front plunger mounted to move
in the sleeve and on the contact, which plunger is provided with

holding means (24, 25, 27) for holding a wire to be connected to said
front insulation-displacement fork (10), said contact (4) itself

being mounted to move in said sleeve (1) between an "out" position,
in which said front insulation-displacement fork (10) projects

outwardly at least in part relative to said front end of the sleeve
(1) and said rear insulation-displacement fork (11) is set back

relative to the conductor inlet (17), and an "in" position, in which
said front insulation-displacement fork (10) and said rear

insulation-displacement fork (11) extend respectively in the "front"
end portion of the sleeve (1) and in the "rear" end portion thereof,

by said plunger (5) being pushed into the sleeve until it reaches a
"closed" position in which it is closed on the front end, said

connection device being characterized in that said plunger (5) and
said contact (4) are provided with coupling means (30, 12) for

coupling them together, so that said contact (4) is entrained in said
sleeve (1) from said in position to said out position by actuating

said plunger so that it goes from said closed position to a "fully-pulled-out"
position.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that said contact
(4) includes two opposite and projecting side tabs (14), and in that

said sleeve (1) includes two internal facing slots (15) receiving
said side tabs of the contact and defining the stroke of the contact

between its in position and its out position.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 2, characterized in
that it includes locking means (14A, 16) for locking said contact (4)

in the in position. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that said locking
means include at least one transverse arm (14A) provided on said

contact (4) and projecting outwardly from the sleeve via a
corresponding window (15A) in the sleeve, and a retaining plate (16)

for holding each arm stationary, which plate is removably mounted on
the outside of the sleeve.
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in
that said sleeve (1) is constituted by a rear sleeve (3) and a front

sleeve (2), which sleeves are mounted end-to-end, are secured
together, and are open to each other at the join between them.
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that said slots
(15) extend in a front portion of said rear sleeve (3).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that said conductor inlet (17) is constituted firstly by two holes in

the respective rear portions of the walls of the sleeve that are
parallel to the contact (4) and secondly, on the outsides of the

walls, by a guide trough (18) opening out in one of the holes, and by
a stop (19) facing the other hole.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that said coupling means (30, 12) are provided with an elongate

aperture (12) in an intermediate portion of the contact (4), and with
a lug (30) disposed on said plunger (5) and captively received in

said aperture.
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that said aperture
is a resilience-imparting aperture associated with either the front

insulation-displacement fork (10) or with the rear insulation-displacement
fork (11) of the contact, thereby delimiting a possible

stroke for the plunger relative to the contact between a "closed"
position in which the plunger (5) is closed on the front end (2A) of

the sleeve (1), and a "half-pulled-out" position. 
A device according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that said
sleeve is provided with a front and almost-end internal shoulder (32)

serving as an end-of-stroke abutment for the plunger, in a "fully-pulled-out"
position beyond said half-pulled-out position.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in
that said sleeve (1) is filled with grease.
A connection strip, characterized in that it is formed by a
series of devices, according to any one of claims 1 to 11, juxtaposed

in at least one row.
