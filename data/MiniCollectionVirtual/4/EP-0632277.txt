<ABSTRACT>
A testing device for indicating the existence of the electric voltage in high-voltage or medium-voltage systems or the like has a coupling part (11) which is capacitively coupled via a coupling electrode (2) to a high-voltage-carrying component (1) and is designed for supplying a display device (7). In order to make it possible to carry out a check of the functional capacity of the coupling part, the display device (7) has an additional measuring path which generates an additional control signal producing a separate test-current indication signal, in the event of a minimum test value lying above a predetermined working-current value by a predetermined differential value.
