<ABSTRACT>
An antenna has a quarter wave resonant strip (10) and first and 
second parasitically excited strips (12 and 14) resonant at a lower and 

upper frequency, respectively, of the antenna bandwidth. The strips (10, 
12 and 14) have trim tabs (20, 22 and 24) for adjusting the resonant 

frequency of each strip. The location of a feed (30) is set to provide a 
desired impedance match for use by a radio (60) such as a pager. A 

ground plane (40) provides a grounding for the strips (10, 12 and 14) and 
inhibits undesirable radio frequency interaction between the radio (60) 

and the strips (10, 12 and 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to antennas for receiving and
transmitting UHF radio frequency signals ranging between 800 MHz and
3,000 MHz, and more particularly to such antennas for use in miniature
portable devices.With the advent of new paging systems operating in the radio
frequency range between substantially 800 MHz and 3,000 MHz, a new
problem arises in designing a miniature antenna having the bandwidth
necessary for such systems. Conventional pager antennas have a
bandwidth limited to about 1% of the receive frequency. This does not
provide for frequency hopping in the 902 to 928 MHz band. Furthermore, a
single conventional loop antennas cannot both transmit in the 901 to 902
MHz band while receiving in the 929 to 932 or 940 to 941 MHz paging
channels as is necessary for new ack-back paging systems.Thus, what is needed is an antenna for use in a miniature paging
device which has a wider bandwidth.It is generally known to use parasitic resonators for increasing the bandwidth of an antenna, as shown for example in GB-A-2 067 842. Such parasitic resonators will be used in the invention.In accordance with the invention, a miniature radio is provided as
set forth in claim 1.FIG. 1 shows a top view of an antenna in accordance with the
preferred embodiment of the invention.FIG. 2 shows a side view of the antenna in accordance with the
preferred embodiment of the invention. FIG. 3 shows a Smith chart representation of the input impedance
resulting from experimental characterization of the antenna of the
preferred embodiment.FIG. 4 shows a plot of the standing wave ratio (SWR) resulting
from experimental characterization of the antenna of the preferred
embodiment.FIG. 5 shows a top view of an alternate embodiment of the present
invention.FIG. 6 shows a cross sectional view of the alternate embodiment of
FIG. 5.FIG. 1 shows a top view of an antenna in accordance with the
preferred embodiment of the invention. The antenna comprises a
driven resonant strip, 10, a first parasitically excited strip, 12, and a second
parasitically excited strip 14. Parasitically excited strips, 12 and 14, are
separated from the resonant strip, 10, by a predetermined distance 16.
The strips 10, 12 and 14 are affixed to a first surface of a low loss dielectric
substrate 18.FIG. 1 also shows three trim tabs, 20, 22 and 24, for adjusting a
resonant frequency of each strip of the antenna, wherein a first of the
three trim tabs, 20, is attached the resonant strip, 10, a second of said three
trim tabs, 22, is attached to the first
