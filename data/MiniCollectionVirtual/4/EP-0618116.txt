<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
hydraulically operated brake system of a motor vehicle, and 
more particularly to an improvement in accuracy of control 
of the brake pressures for the vehicle wheels to maintain 
the slip ratios of the wheels within an optimum range. An anti-lock brake control device, a wheel 
traction control device, and a brake control device adapted 
to provide a desired braking effect are known as an 
apparatus for controlling the brake pressure for a motor 
vehicle. The anti-lock brake control device and the wheel 
traction control device are designed to regulate the brake 
pressure so as to prevent an excessive slip ratio of the 
vehicle wheels upon braking or acceleration of the vehicle. 
The brake control device adapted to provide a desired 
braking effect is designed to regulate the brake pressure so 
that the actual braking effect given to the vehicle 
coincides with a desired value determined by a brake 
operating amount such as the operating force applied to a  
 
brake pedal or the operating amount of the brake pedal, 
irrespective of variations in the friction coefficient of 
friction members of wheel brakes, amount of load of the 
vehicle and gradient of the road surface. An example of such brake pressure control 
apparatus is disclosed in JP-A-2-310161, which includes (1) 
wheel speed obtaining means for obtaining the actual 
rotating speed of a wheel of the vehicle, (2) reference 
wheel speed obtaining means for obtaining a reference speed 
of the wheel as a desired wheel speed, on the basis of a 
running speed of the vehicle, (3) commanding means for 
generating brake control commands for increasing or 
decreasing the brake pressure to be applied for braking the 
wheel, on the basis of the actual wheel speed obtained by 
the wheel speed obtaining means and the reference wheel 
speed obtained by the reference wheel speed obtaining means, 
and (4) pressure regulating means operated according to the 
brake control commands, to regulate the brake pressure. The brake pressure is increased or decreased by 
the pressure regulating means indicated above, which is 
operated on the basis of the brake control commands. It 
takes some time after an increase or decrease in the brake 
pressure, and before a change in the actual wheel speed 
occurs as a result of the brake pressure increase or 
decrease. Thus, the known brake pressure control apparatus 
suffers from a control delay. In view of this drawback, the  
 
commanding means is commonly adapted to generate the
