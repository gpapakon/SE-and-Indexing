<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel improved 
process for producing a modified phenolic resin. This 

process comprises extracting a polycondensation reaction 
product with a specific extraction solvent, optionally 

performing a neutralization treatment, to thereby produce a 
modified phenolic resin containing substantially no acid so 

that it does not corrode metal. In combination with an 
epoxy resin, the modified phenolic resin provides a resin 

molding having excellent electrical insulating properties and 
thermal and moisture resistances. An advantageous molding 

material based on the modified phenolic resin and an 
advantageous material for electrical or electronic parts and 

semiconductor sealant each produced utilizing the molding 
material are provided by the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for 
producing a modified phenolic resin, a molding material 
based on the modified phenolic resin, and a material for 
electrical or electronic parts and a semiconductor sealant 
(sealing compound) each produced utilizing the molding 
material. More particularly, the present invention is concerned 
with a process for producing a modified phenolic resin 
which contains substantially no acid so that it does not 
corrode metal and which can provide, in combination with an 
epoxy resin, a resin molding having excellent electrical 
insulating property and thermal and moisture resistances. 
Further, the present invention is concerned with a molding 
material based on the modified phenolic resin and a 
material for electrical or electronic part and a 
semiconductor sealant each produced utilizing the molding 
material. Phenolic resin provides moldings excellent in 
mechanical properties, and hence has widely been employed 
from of old either independently or in the form of a blend 
with another resin, such as an epoxy resin. However, the 
phenolic resin per se and blendsthereof have drawbacks in 
that light and alkali resistances are relatively low, 
that they are likely to absorb water or an alcohol to 
thereby suffer from changes in dimension and electrical 
resistance, and that the thermal resistance, especially the 
oxidation resistance at high temperatures, thereof is poor. In order to overcome these drawbacks, various 
modifications of the phenolic resin have been studied. For 
example, various modified phenolic resins have been 
proposed, which have improved resistances to deterioration 
and oxidation due to light and chemicals by virtue of 
a modification using fats and fatty oils, a rosin or a 
neutral aromatic compound. Among the various proposals, Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open Publication No. 235413/1986 discloses 
a preparation of a phenol-modified aromatic hydrocarbon 
resin having excellent thermal resistance by selecting 
reactants thereof. However, the phenolic resin obtained by 
this method is disadvantageously not cured unless it is 
maintained at a high temperature for a prolonged period of 
time in the manufacture of a molding which uses it. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 
274714/1990 discloses that a modified phenolic resin useful  
 
as a molding material, having excellent thermal and 
oxidation resistances and mechanical strength as cannot be 
expected from a conventional phenolic resin, is obtained 
by
