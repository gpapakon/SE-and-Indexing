<ABSTRACT>
An improved aqueous fabric cleaning shampoo composition contains a combination of (a) about 0.5-20% by weight of a fabric cleaning polymer which is a solid at 25  C and water dispersible or water soluble upon neuturalization with an alkaline compound such as a polymer of methacrylic acid/styrene/n-butyl acrylate, (b) about 0.1-10% by weight of a specific type of wax having a melting point of at least 50  C such as pressure-emulsified polyethylene wax and (c) about 0.05-5% by weight of a silicone betaine polymer in addition to an effective amount of at least one conventional anionic, nonionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactant in water at a pH of from about 7 to about 10.5. Such a fabric cleaning shampoo composition not only provides good cleaning and conditioning to fabrics, particularly synthetic fibre fabrics, such as those used in carpets as well as to upholstery and pile fabrics, but also provides soil resistance to the fabric cleaned with such a composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved aqueous fabric
cleaning shampoo composition containing a combination of a
fabric cleaning polymer, a specific type of wax and a
silicone betaine polymer in addition to at least one
conventional surfactant to provide a fabric cleaning shampoo
composition which not only provides good cleaning and
conditioning to fabrics, particularly synthetic fibre
fabrics, such as those used in carpets as well as to
upholstery and pile fabrics, but also provides improved soil
resistance to fabrics cleaned with such a composition.Shampoo compositions for use on fabric materials such as
carpets and upholstery have existed for a number of years.
These types of products are used on fabrics that are large in
size or fixed in place on furniture and thus cannot be easily
removed from their current location for cleaning. In the
case of carpets and rugs, these fabrics tend to receive high
foot traffic and may get dirty rather quickly. Because of
their size or location, such fabrics are not cleaned very
often and thus it is beneficial to provide such fabrics with
soil repellent treatments. Unlike articles of clothing that
can be laundered in a clothes washing machine, the
surfactants used to clean such fabrics cannot readily be
rinsed from the fabric with water since the carpet or
upholstery is fixed in place. Therefore there has been a
constant desire to provide fabric cleaning compositions that
can remove soil from carpets or upholstery with a minimum
amount of water to speed drying of the fabric being cleaned
while removing as much of the surfactants as possible since
they tend to attract soil. Excess water can also cause
shrinkage and warping of carpeting and may also promote mold
growth. It is further desirable to have the cleaning
composition impart anti-soiling properties to the fabric 
being cleaned to increase the time span between cleanings.
Conditioning of the fabrics as a part of the cleaning process
is also desirable.Anti-soiling or soil repellency is described as the
ability of a fabric such as a carpet to resist subsequent
resoiling as a result of normal use such as foot traffic on
carpets and ordinary use of furniture. It is a rough measure
of the attraction or repulsion power of the products used to
clean the fabric. Most carpeting and, often fabric furniture
upholstery, is treated with a soil-resisting layer during the
manufacture of the fabric or shortly before it is provided to
the consumer. Examples of such treatments are the TEFLON®
carpet treatment from E. I. Du Pont De
