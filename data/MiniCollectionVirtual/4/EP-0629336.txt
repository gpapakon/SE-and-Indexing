<ABSTRACT>
In a furrow-clearing device for an agricultural seed drill, with two rolling bodies which rotate about horizontal axes and which between them receive a coulter (46), are arranged at an angle to one another and pick up material residues and convey them laterally outwards, the rolling bodies are designed as pressing wheels (52, 54) with a uniform periphery rolling on the ground and retaining material residues, the coulter having a cutting edge (99), by means of which material residues drawn apart from one another by the two pressing wheels (52, 54) can be cut up.

<CLAIMS>
A furrow cleaning device for an agricultural seed drill with two rolling bodies
rotating about horizontal axles which receive a

coulter (46) therebetween and are inclined relative to one another for engaging and moving crop
residues laterally to the outside, characterized in that the rolling bodies are in the form of press

wheels (52, 54) with uniform peripheries rolling on the ground and holding crop residues fast,
wherein crop residues pulled apart by the two press wheels (52, 54) can be cut by the cutting

edge (99) of the coulter (46).
A device according to claim 1, characterized by two connecting parts (43, 45) extending forwards
in operational use, each of which pivotally receives a pivoted arm (48, 50) at its front end, on the free end

of which arm a press wheel (52, 54) is rotatably mounted.
A device according to claim 2, characterized by a third connecting part (44) extending forwards
in operational use, which receives a disc coulter (46) rotatably at its front end, the coulter being

provided with a cutting edge (99) at its periphery.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that each pivoted arm (48, 50) is subject to the
action of two springs (68, 72) independent of one another.
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that each spring (68, 72) can be tensioned by an
adjustable positioning rod (84).
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the pivotal
movement of each pivoted arm (48, 50) can be limited by a stop plate (95).
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that each positioning rod (84) can be fitted in one
of at least two bores (86) provided in the first and seco
nd connecting parts (43, 45).
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that each spring (68,
72) comprises a bent end (78, 88) which can be fitted in an opening (80) in the corresponding

pivoted arm (48, 50), and a tangential end (82, 92) which bears against the corresponding
positioning rod (84), wherein the springs (68, 72) are provided on the two sides of the

corresponding first or second connecting part (43, 45) and fit on a pivot pin (66) connecting the 
pivoted arm (48, 50) to the connecting part (43, 45).
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims in combination with a seed drill which
comprises a furrow opener (22), characterized in that the press wheels (52, 54) lie ahead of the

furrow opener (22) in relation to the direction of travel and in relation to a planting line (PL)
determined by the furrow opener (22) are arranged in V formation on the two sides of this

planting line.
