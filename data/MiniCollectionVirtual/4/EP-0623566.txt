<ABSTRACT>
An artificial stone (brick, building block) made of densified, essentially granular material bound by means of cement is described. According to the invention, it is provided that the material up to a height (h) of at least 70% of the stone consists of building rubble from which wood, plastics and metals have been sorted out and which has been crushed to a particle size of up to 15 mm, and that the material in the region of the remaining height (h') of the stone, including the face (A), contains no building rubble.

<CLAIMS>
Artificial stone consisting of compressed, cement-bound, 
essentially grained material, 
characterized in 
that
 up to a height (h) of the stone of at least 70 %, 
the material consists of demolition waste crushed to a 

grain size of 15 mm at the most, from which wood, 
plastics and metals were selected and that the material 

contains no demolition waste in the region of the 
residual height (h') of the stone, including the 

visible face (A). 
Stone according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
demolition waste is crushed to a grain size of 0 to 8 

mm. 
Stone according to claim 1, characterized in that, in 
order to increase the fine grain portion, the material 

consisting of demolition waste is enriched with natural 
sand up to 8 % by volume, and that other additives such 

as plasticizers and/or blowing agents are added in only 
minor quanities. 
Stone according to claim 1, characterized in that, in 
order to reduce the fine grain portion, the material 

consisting of demolition waste is enriched with coarse 
grain up to 8 % by volume, and that other additives  

 
such as plasticizers and/or blowing agents are added 

only in minor quantities. 
Stone according to at least one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the residual height (h') which 

does not contain demolition waste, consists of a 
material which comprises concrete in a mixture of sand 

with fine gravel, wherein the sand has a grain size of 
preferably 0 to 2 mm and the fine gravel has a grain 

size preferably 1 to 3 mm. 
Stone according to claim 5, characterized in that his 
compressive strength is at least 50 kN/cm
2
. 
Stone according to at least one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the height (h) consisting of 

demolition waste is 90 % of the total height. 
Stone according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
height consisting of demolition waste is 7,2 cm and the 

residual height is 0,8 cm.
