<ABSTRACT>
A technique is described for the preparation of a 
thin film of a silicon nitride diffusion barrier to 

gallium on a silicon integrated circuit chip. The 
technique involves reacting nitrogen and silane in a ratio 

of 53:1 to 300:1 in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor 
deposition apparatus. The described technique is of 

interest for use in the monolithic integration of 
interconnected GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructures, 

modulators and silicon MOSFET structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of silicon nitride 
as a gallium diffusion barrier during molecular beam 
epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide compounds on silicon 
sub-micron metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) electronics. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
technique for the deposition of silicon nitride films by 
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in which 
the composition of the gas employed during the deposition 
process is controlled within a specific range. The use of optical interconnects for silicon 
integrated circuits has been employed heretofore to take 
advantage of the greater capacity of optoelectronics for 
communications while retaining the computational 
advantages of silicon electronics. The integration of 
optoelectronic devices directly on silicon circuits offers 
the added advantage that such devices need not be located 
along the chip edge, thereby enhancing the potential for 
increasing the "pinout count" of the chip. Accordingly, 
those skilled in the art have focused their interest upon 
the molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium 
arsenide/aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs/AlGaAs) multiple  
 
quantum well modulators on submicron MOS electronics. During the growth of gallium arsenide on MOS devices 
by heteroepitaxy, it is necessary to protect the silicon 
device from the affect of gallium which readily diffuses 
into the silicon, so resulting in the formation of a 
conductive oxide. In order to obviate this limitation, 
the use of a silicon nitride layer over the oxide has been 
found to result in a diffusion barrier during molecular 
beam epitaxial growth. However, in order to assure 
success of the nitride barrier it is essential that the 
barrier evidence sufficient resistance to hydrofluoric 
acid used to clean the silicon surfaces prior to growth. 
Furthermore, the nitride barrier must evidence sufficient 
mechanical stability to withstand oxide desorption at 
temperatures in excess of 900 degrees Centigrade which 
are necessary for the successful growth of gallium 
arsenide on silicon without effecting cracking or loss of 
adhesion. The mechanical stability is especially critical 
for submicron MOS electronics which have as their top 
dielectric layer a glass which liquefies at 850 degrees 
Centigrade to round the edges of contact holes. It is 
this liquification of the reflow glass which tends to 
cause failure of the nitride diffusion barrier. In accordance with the present invention, the 
limitations of the prior art methodology are
