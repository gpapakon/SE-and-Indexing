<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhancing adherence to the skin of a 
skin care preparation containing an active ingredient by 

incorporating into the skin care preparation a film forming 
agen
t as an ingredient and applying the skin care preparation 
containing the active ingredient and the film forming agent 

to the skin. The invention is characterized by the film 
forming agent being an aqueous latex of a crosslinked 

polydiorganosiloxane. Sunscreen preparations and eye 
cosmetics are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to personal care and, 
more particularly, to skin care products including color 
cosmetics, which have been found to possess improved skin 
substantivity characteristics. Water and wear resistance are vital properties to 
skin protection products, since contact with water by 
perspiration and swimming, can destroy the effectiveness of 
an otherwise beneficial skin care product. Where greater 
protective qualities, high water resistance and substantive 
barrier characteristics, are desired in a skin care product, 
it is customary in the art to incorporate various organic 
waxes, organic resins and organic polymers, into the skin 
care product in order to achieve these goals. What has been discovered in accordance with the 
present invention is that certain silicone based materials 
can be employed as viable alternatives to the organic waxes, 
resins and polymers, customarily used heretofore. 
Specifically, the silicone based material is an aqueous latex 
of a crosslinked polydiorganosiloxane. While the aqueous latex of the crosslinked 
polydiorganosiloxane is described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,584,341 issued April 22, 1986, the use of the aqueous 
latex of the '341 patent in the manner setforth in accordance 
with the present invention, has not been previously 
exploited. Thus, insofar as the '341 patent is concerned, 
the use of the aqueous latex therein is described with 
reference to (i) coatings and impregnants for paper or fabric 
products, (ii) construction coatings, (iii) film cast 
products, (iv) thick cast parts, (v) caulking and (vi) 
electrically conductive films.  
 There is no suggestion in the '341 patent that the 
aqueous latex compositions described therein would possess 
utility in the personal care arena. EP A 0 388 582 describes a cosmetic comprising a 
specific acryl-silicone graft copolymer (A) having an 
organosiloxane side chain prepared by radical 
polymerization of a dimethylpolysiloxane and an acrylate or 
methacrylate monomer. The copolymer (A) can be used in 
various types of cosmetic compositions including oil-in-water 
type emulsion cosmetics to provide an improved range 
of properties including good adhesiveness. The invention relates to a method of enhancing the 
adherence to the skin of a skin care preparation containing 
an active ingredient such as a pigment, sunscreen, 
moisturizer or emollient. The method involves incorporating 
into the skin care preparation a film forming agent as an 
ingredient thereof and applying the skin care preparation

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cosmetic method of enhancing adherence to the skin of 
a skin care preparation comprising an active ingredient 

selected from pigments, sunscreens, moisturizers and 
emollients, comprising the step of incorporating into the 

skin care preparation 5-20 percent by weight of a film 
forming agent as an ingredient thereof and applying the skin 

care preparation containing the active ingredient and the 
film forming agent to the skin; the film forming agent being 

an aqueous latex of a crosslinkable polydiorganosiloxane 
prepared by a method comprising: 


(A) homogenizing a mixture comprising (1) one 
hundred parts by weight of a polydiorganosiloxane of the 

formula HO(R
2
SiO)
x
H wherein R is a radical selected from 
methyl, ethyl, propyl, phenyl, vinyl, allyl and 

3,3,3-trifluoropropyl and x is an integer having an average 
value of three to one hundred; (2) 15-75 millimoles of 

surface active anionic catalyst per kilogram of polydiorganosiloxane 
wherein said catalyst is selected from 

dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid and hydrogen lauryl sulfate; and 
(3) water, to yield an oil in water emulsion; 
(B) admixing 0.5-15 parts by weight of an alkoxy 
silicon compound selected from (i) silanes of the formula 

R'
a
Si(OR
3
)
4-a
 wherein R' is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical 
having up to twelve carbon atoms, R
3
 is an alkyl radical 
having one to six carbon atoms and a has a value of zero or 

one; (ii) a partial hydrolyzate of the silane which is 
soluble in the polydiorganosiloxane; and (iii) mixtures of 

the silane and the partial hydrolyzate;  
 
(C) maintaining the emulsion at a temperature of 15 
to 30Â°C. for at least five hours at a pH of less than five 

until a crosslinked polymer emulsion is formed; 
(D) admixing sufficient base to raise the pH of the 
crosslinked polymer emulsion to greater than seven; and 

optionally 
(E) admixing greater than one part by weight of 
colloidal silica sol or colloidal silsesquioxane; 

to yield a latex which produces an elastomer upon removal of 
the water at room temperature. 
The cosmetic method according to claim 1 in which the 
skin care preparation is a sunscreen composition which 

includes as the active ingredient thereof at least one 
ultraviolet light absorbing compound. 
The cosmetic method according to claim 2 in which the 
ultraviolet light absorbing compound is 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate 

or 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone. 
The cosmetic method according to claim 1 in which the 
skin care preparation is an eye cosmetic composition selected 

from eyebrow pencils and liquids, eye shadows, eyeliners, eye 
creams and mascara. 
The cosmetic method according to claim 4 in which the 
eye cosmetic composition is mascara which includes an active 

ingredient selected from waxes, oils and pigments.  
 
A sunscreen preparation containing a film 
forming agent and at least one ultraviolet light absorbing 

compound as the active ingredient thereof, characterized by 
the film forming agent being an aqueous latex of a cross-linkable 

polydiorganosiloxane prepared by the method comprising steps 
(A) to (D) and optionally step (E) as defined in claim 1. 
The sunscreen preparation according to claim 6 
in which the ultraviolet light absorbing compound is

forming agent is an aqueous latex of a crosslinkable polydiorganosiloxane 
prepared by the method comprising steps (A) to (D) and 

optionally step (E) as defined in claim 1.
