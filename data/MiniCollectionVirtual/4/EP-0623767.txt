<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for 
cooling a gear system. The gear system 

comprises a box (1) and transmission 
gears (11,12) fitted inside it. The box 

(1) of the gear system is at least 
partially filled with a fluid (15). 

According to the invention, the gearbox 
(1) is provided with a heat transfer tube 

(16) going through the box (1) in its 
fluid-filled portion. To remove heat from 

the gear system, air is blown through the 
tube (16) by means of an air impeller 

(17). The exterior and interior surfaces 
of the tube (16) are provided with fins 

for more efficient heat transfer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for cooling the gear 
system of a crane according to the preamble of claim 1. In the intermediate gears transmitting the torque in gear 
systems, part of the power to be transmitted is converted into 
heat in the gears, friction surfaces and bearings. For example, 
in the gear system of a 100-kW crane, the propor-tion of this 
power consumption is of the order of about 5%. At least part 
of the power converted into heat must be dis-sipated so as to 
prevent the operating temperature of the gear system from 
rising too much, which would cause a de-terioration of the 
lubricating power and reduce the service life of the gear 
system. In certain crane applications, the gear system is also 
used as a brake, which means that a large proportion of the 
braking power is converted into heat in the gear system. In 
such applications, the amount of heat to be dissipated is still 
larger. In earlier technology, the heat developed in gear systems has 
been dissipated via natural conduction of heat from the gear 
box into the ambient air. For more efficient cooling, the 
outside surface of the gear box has been provided with cooling 
fins increasing the external area of the box, thereby enhancing 
the conduction of heat. In cooling systems engineering, 
solutions are known where an operating machine or a separate 
mechanism is used to create a flow of cooling air along the box 
walls. E.g. in the gear system of a crane, which is operated 
intermittently, it is not possible to use a fan mounted on the 
shaft of the gear system to produce a sufficient ventilation. 
On the other hand, installing an extra fan on the outside to 
create an air flow along the box walls is out of the question 
because of the costs and the extra space required for the fan. 
In applications where the braking power is converted into heat 
in the gear system, the volume of the gear box has also been 
increased, allowing a larger amount of thermal power to be 
stored and increasing the box surface area conducting heat.  The object of the present invention is to achieve a cooling 
system for a gear system which is simple and cheap to manufacture 
and produces a sufficient cooling power in all situations. 
To accomplish this, the invention is characterized by 
the features specified in the characterization part of claim 
1. Other embodiments of the invention are character-ized by the 
features presented in the subclaims. The solution of the invention provides a high cooling capacity. 
It is easy to fit in
