<ABSTRACT>
A metallic dowel (1) of an insulation anchor exhibits an expansion sleeve (2), at one end of which there is fitted a retaining plate (3) which exhibits a central opening. The retaining plate (3) exhibits an inner border region (17) which is bent over into the expansion sleeve (2) and has an inner border (20) binding the opening. Furthermore, provision is made for a covering cap (21) which consists of an elastically compliant material of low thermal conductivity and exhibits a covering plate (22) and a retaining pin (23) projecting therefrom, the external diameter of the retaining pin (23) being greater than the internal diameter of the inner border region (17).
