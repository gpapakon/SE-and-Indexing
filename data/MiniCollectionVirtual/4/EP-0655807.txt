<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector has matable halves 
(110,118) having a position assurance device (150). The 

position assurance device (150) has locking arms (158) 
for latching the position assurance device (150) in 

first and second positions. The position assurance 
device cannot be fully advanced to the second position 

unless the matable halves (110,1218) are fully mated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector 
which is matable to another connector. In particular, 
the invention is directed to an electrical connector 
which has a connector position assurance device that can 
only be moved to a fully inserted position when the 
connectors are completely mated. U.S. Patent 4,370,013 is directed to a lock member 
which is designed to assure that a pair of male and 
female electrical connectors, which are initially fully 
coupled and positively locked together by a manual 
assembly operation, remain locked by means of the lock 
member. The lock member avoids the problem of the 
electrical connectors being decoupled by vibration or 
some other environmental influence during subsequent use 
and, in effect, is intended to prevent, without 
disclosure of the fact, the disassembly of the 
connectors. U.S. Patent 4,634,204 discloses two connectors, 
which when mated, have a connector position assurance 
and assist device inserted axially along a tracked slot. 
If the connectors are only partially interconnected, 
upon initial insertion of the connector position 
assurance and assist device though the connector it will 
assist the two connectors to become fully and rigidly 
mated, whereas if the device is improperly inserted into 
the connector it will refuse the further mating of the 
connectors. U.S. Patent 5,120,255 teaches of a complete locking 
confirming device for confirming the complete locking of 
an electrical connector assembly. The device has a 
locking detector slider mounted on either housing so as 
to be positioned at an indicating position only when the 
housings are coupled completely. The above references teach electrical connectors 
which have some type of connector position assurance  
 
member. However, it would be beneficial to provide 
electrical connectors with connector position assurance 
members which cannot be moved to the final position 
until a mating connector is mated to the electrical 
connector. The invention is directed to a connector position 
assurance device for use with mating connectors. The 
connector position assurance device has a locking arm 
which extends from a body portion. The locking arm is 
stiff and is dimensioned to cooperate with a respective 
portion of a first mating connector. At least one 
latching arm cooperates with the mating connectors to 
movably maintain the connector position assurance device 
on a respective connector. The at least one latching 
arm being movable between a first and a second position. The

<CLAIMS>
A connector position assurance device (150) 
for use with mating connectors, the connector position 

assurance device comprising: 
   a locking arm (152) which extends from a body 

portion (154), the locking arm being stiff and being 
dimensioned to cooperate with a respective portion of a 

first mating connector (118); and 
   at least one latching arm (158) which cooperates 

with the mating connectors to movably maintain the 
connector position assurance device (150) on a respective 

connector (110), at least one latching arm being movable 
between a first and a second position. 
A connector position assurance device as 
recited in claim 1 wherein the locking arm (152) engages a 

section of the first connector (118) to prevent the movement 
of the connector position assurance device (150) from the 

first position to the second position unless the first 
mating connector (118) and a second mating connector (110) are 

properly mated together. 
A connector position assurance device as 
recited in claim 1 wherein the at least one latching arm (158) 

is spaced from the body portion (154) to allow a free end 
(162) thereof to be resiliently deformed. 
A connector position assurance device as 
recited in claim 3 wherein at least two latching arms 

are provided on the body portion (154), wherein the 
longitudinal axis of the latching arms (158) is essentially 

parallel to the longitudinal axis of the locking arm (152). 
A connector position assurance device as 
recited in claim 4 wherein each latching arm (158) has first 

angled surface (170) proximate the free end, a first 
locking shoulder (172), a second angled surface (174), 

and a second locking shoulder (176).
