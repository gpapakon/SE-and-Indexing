<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for detecting a flashover between conductors in power transmission lines of different voltage levels suspended from the same towers and wherein the power lines are included in a power network where one of the power lines is stated to be a high-voltage power line (1) and where the other power lines are connected to the high-voltage line via transformers of a known transformer ratio (am) and internal impedance (ZXm) and wherein the line impendances (ZL) are known. Specific to the invention is that the fault current which is caused by a flashover is set to be equal to a detected current change in any of the phases in the high-voltage line. With this assumption an equation system can be set up with the aid of which the relative distance to fault n (0
<
n
<
1) can be determined. If the produced value of n lies within the stated region, this is interpreted as if an internal flashover has occurred.

<DESCRIPTION>
For environmental and cost reasons, particularly in densely 
populated areas, several power transmission lines with 
different voltage levels are allowed to be suspended from 
the same towers. This arrangement will hereinafter be 
referred to as a multi-circuit transmission line. Each one 
of the lines included is in the usual manner provided with 
protective devices in the form of impedance protection, 
ground-fault protection, differential protection etc. and 
with devices for fault location. All of these protective 
devices are based on current and voltage measurement either 
at one or at the other end or on simultaneous measurement at 
both ends of the respective line. Since the lines in a multi-circuit system are normally suspended 
in such a way that there may be only a few metres 
between conductors belonging to different voltage levels, 
factors such as heavy wind, ice formation on the individual 
conductors, fallen trees and other things may cause these 
conductors to come into contact with each other. In certain 
unfortunate cases, the contact between the conductors may 
last for quite a long time, among other things because of 
the conductors being welded together or the like. In the 
following such a fault will be referred to as a flashover 
fault. If the flashover fault occurs within the protective 
zone of the protective devices, the fault will be called an 
intersystem fault. Even if it is a question of a fault of 
very short duration, an intersystem fault gives rise to 
changed current and voltage conditions at the fault location 
and may in certain cases also entail a risk of personal 
injury. Such faults should, of course, be identified and be acted 
upon in some way as quickly as possible. However, the above-mentioned 
protective devices provide no, or insignificant,  
 
information as to the occurrence of an intersystem fault. 
The present invention relates to a method and a device for 
detection of an intersystem fault in a multi-circuit 
transmission line. A method for detecting an intersystem fault in the multi-circuit 
transmission line which comprises two lines of 
different voltages is described in Cigre Conference paper 
34-206, Paris 1990, by H Becker, J Nilges and H Dittrich 
entitled "Distance protection of double-circuit lines with 
different rated voltages during intersystem faults". The 
method is based on the distance protection principle. To be able to selectively detect a short circuit according 
to the above-mentioned principle, it is necessary, when a 
short circuit
