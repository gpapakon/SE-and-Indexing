<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
hydraulically operated brake system of a motor vehicle, and 
more particularly to an improvement in accuracy of control 
of the brake pressures for the vehicle wheels to maintain 
the slip ratios of the wheels within an optimum range. An anti-lock brake control device and a wheel 
traction control device are known as an apparatus for 
controlling the brake pressure for a motor vehicle. The anti-lock brake control device is designed to 
regulate the brake pressure so as to prevent an excessive 
slip ratio of the vehicle wheels upon braking of the 
vehicle, and the wheel traction control device is designed 
to achieve the same purpose upon acceleration of the 
vehicle. An example of such brake pressure control 
apparatus is disclosed in JP-A-3-128754, which includes 
wheel speed obtaining means for obtaining the rotating speed 
of a wheel of the vehicle, and pressure regulating means for 
regulating the brake pressure to brake the wheel, on the  
 
basis of the wheel speed obtained by the wheel speed 
obtaining means, the running speed of the vehicle and a 
predetermined optimum slip amount of the wheel. The brake pressure is increased or decreased by 
the pressure regulating means indicated above, which is 
operated on the basis of the wheel speed obtained by the 
wheel speed obtaining means. A change in the actual wheel 
speed actually occurs some time after an increase or 
decrease in the brake pressure is commenced. Thus, the known brake pressure control apparatus 
tends to suffer from a control delay. In view of this 
drawback, the pressure regulating means is commonly adapted 
to determine the points of time of increase and decrease of 
the brake pressure, on the basis of not only the wheel speed 
but also the wheel acceleration value. However, the wheel acceleration value is likely to 
be influenced by external disturbances such as the waviness 
or bumpiness of the road surface and the vibration of the 
wheel. The use of a filter for effectively smoothing the 
wheel acceleration value so as to remove the external 
disturbances causes a delay in obtaining the wheel 
acceleration value, and offsets the advantage of introducing 
the wheel acceleration value for the determination of the 
points of time at which the brake pressure is increased and 
decreased. Thus, it has been difficult to suitably determine 
the points of time of the brake pressure increase and  
 
decrease, and this has been an obstacle to the improvement 
in the accuracy of control of
