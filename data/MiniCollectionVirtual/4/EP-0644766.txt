<ABSTRACT>
Dermatological compositions comprising nitrous oxide and at least one essential fatty acid or lower alkyl ester thereof in a dermatologically acceptable carrier medium is useful in the treatment of a variety of skin, muscle and joint disorders including psoriasis, shingles, fever blisters, chicken pox, acne, chilblains, eczema, chloasmas, alopecia, dermatitis, ringworm and burn wounds. The composition preferably also includes additional ingredients selected from coal tar, collagen, nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, lanolin, vitamin E, methyl salicylate, arnica, and H1-antagonist antihistamines or combinations thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to dermatological compositions.
The compositions of this invention are suitable to be
applied to the human skin for the treatment of a
variety of skin, muscular, joint and peripheral
circulation conditions.It is known in the field of dermatology to make use of
coal tar preparations in the treatment of certain skin
conditions, for example, psoriasis [Hunter J.A.A.,
Savin J.A. and Dahl M.V., Clinical Dermatology,
Blackwell Scientific Publications p.49].It has also been suggested that essential fatty acids,
including evening primrose oil may be used in the
treatment of skin conditions such as eczema [see
references cited by July Graham, Evening Primrose Oil,
Thorsons, pp. 127-128].Various other compositions are known to be used in the
treatment of these and other skin conditions. GB-A-105919
and EP-A-0213827 disclose skin treatment compositions
which contain N2O as a propellent rather than as an
active ingredient and which do not contain an essential
fatty acid or ester thereof as required by the present
invention. According to the present invention there is provided a
dermatological composition having as active ingredients
nitrous oxide and at least one essential fatty acid or
ester thereof selected from the group consisting of
linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, linolenic acid,
gamma-linolenic acid, and the lower alkyl esters
thereof in a dermatologically acceptable carrier and
the use of nitrous oxide as an active ingredient in the manufacture of
a dermatological composition for use in the treatment of skin conditions.The composition may further include one or more supplementary
ingredients selected from the group consisting
of liquid picus carb. [also known as coal tar
solution], collagen, nicotinamide, nicotinic acid,
lanolin, vitamin E, methyl salicylate, and known
H1-antagonist antihistamines.In the preferred form of the invention the composition
is saturated with nitrous oxide.Also in the preferred form of the invention the
essential fatty acid component of the composition
comprises a mixture of esters of the fatty acids listed
above. Thus in the most preferred form of the
invention the fatty acid component of the composition
is constituted by the complex known as Vitamin F and in 
this regard it is preferred to make use of the ester
form of Vitamin F known as Vitamin F Ethyl Ester. This
product is commercially available under the trade
description of Vitamin F Ethyl Ester CLR 110 000 Sh.L.
