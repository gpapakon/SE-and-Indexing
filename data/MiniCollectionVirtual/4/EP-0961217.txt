<ABSTRACT>
For receiving clear image data of symbols applied to
the front surface or back surface of an article that is

moved by, for example, a conveyor and for which the
reading distance is constantly changing, a symbol reading

device is provided with an image data input focus point
control section that outputs position data of the article

from a front surface/back surface position detector to an
image data input focus point modifier such that the focus

point of a camera or waist position of a laser beam for
image data input can be constantly matched to the front

surface or back surface of the article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a symbol reading
device according to the preamble of claim 1, and particularly to an optical symbol reading
device for reading symbols on the front and back
surfaces of an article moved by, for example, a
conveyor.When an article is moved by, for example, a
conveyor and bears symbols to be read, movement
caused by the conveyor brings the front surface of the
article toward the symbol reading device and then moves
the back surface away from the symbol reading device.
In other words, when reading symbols on the front or
back surface of an article, the input of the image data
of the symbols must be carried out while the reading
distance, which is the distance between the reading
device and the symbols, is in a constantly changing
state.Typical methods of receiving optical image data
include the use of a camera such as an image pickup tube
or CCD, or directing a laser beam scan light onto the 
surface to which symbols are applied and detecting the
reflected light.. In the prior-art symbol reading device of Fig. 1,
article detector (light projection) 26a and article
detector (light reception) 26b first detect that an
article bearing a bar code to be read has entered the
read zone, following which image data input unit 10,
which constitutes image data input section 1, directs a
laser beam scanning light upon the surface of the bar
code label, a photo-sensor detects the light of the
laser beam scanning light that is reflected from the
surface of the bar code label, an electric signal
converter converts the detection lights to electric
signals and these are interpreted by interpreter 2, and
the interpretation results are then outputted by way of
interpretation result output section 3 to an external
device. Image data input section 1 that uses a camera is
made up by a camera that uses an image pickup tube or
CCD.As can be understood from focusing a camera, a
clear image free of blurring can be obtained in image
data input by camera of the prior art by focusing such
that the reading distance, which is the distance between 
the camera and the symbol, i.e., the article to be read,
is equal to the focal length of the camera lens.In other words, clear images that are free from
blurring cannot be obtained when reading symbols on the
front and back surfaces because the above-described
reading distance is constantly changing as described
above.Similarly, regarding the method of the prior art in
which a laser beam scan light is irradiated, it is
common knowledge that the beam diameter of
