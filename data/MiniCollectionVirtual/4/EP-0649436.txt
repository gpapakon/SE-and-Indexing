<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a stable moulding or spinning compound containing cellulose, a tertiary amine oxide, in particular N-methylmorpholin-N-oxide and optionally water, plus a stabilizer. The compound is characterized in that a mixture of glucosides of gallic acid and m-digallic acid is used as the stabilizer. The stabilizer proposed is superior to gallic acid propyl ester as regards its long-term stabilization action on cellulose dissolved in a tertiary amine oxide.

<CLAIMS>
Stable moulding material or spinning material containing 
cellulose, a tertiary amine oxide, especially N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide, 

a stabiliser and optionally 
water, characterised in that a mixture of the glucosides of 

gallic acid and m-digallic acid is provided as the 
stabiliser. 
Stable moulding material or spinning material in accordance 
with Claim 1, characterised in that tannic acid is provided 

as the stabiliser. 
Stable moulding material or spinning material in accordance 
with Claim 1, characterised in that tannin is provided as 

the stabiliser. 
Stable moulding material or spinning material in accordance 
with one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 

stabiliser is present in a concentration of a maximum of 
0.05% by weight, based on the weight of the cellulose. 
Use of a mixture of glucosides of gallic acid and m-digallic 
acid for the stabilisation of a moulding material 

or spinning material containing cellulose and a tertiary 
amine oxide.
