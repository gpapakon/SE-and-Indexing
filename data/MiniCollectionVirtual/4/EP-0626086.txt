<DESCRIPTION>
 DUAL CHANNEL GLASS BREAK DETECTORBackground of the Present InventionThe following invention relates to a glass break detector and more particularly to an acoustic sensing device that senses two different frequency char¬ acteristics of breaking glass and provides an alarm upon the detection of both occurrences within preselected time frames. The invention results from the discovery that breaking glass produces highly characteristic patterns of acoustic waves, and in particular, produces a charac¬ teristic positive low frequency acoustic wave and a high frequency set of acoustic waves that follow the initial low frequency phenomenon. In the past, glass break detectors have attempted to eliminate the occurrence of false alarms by focusing on high and low frequency characteristics of breaking glass. The U.S. patent to ϊanagi, No. 4,091,660, detects signals in a frequency range of less than 50,000 cycles and of greater than 100,ooo cycles, producing an enabling aignal for an alarm when both frequency components are present at the same time. Other devices recognize that different frequency components may be present at different times. In Davenport et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,668,94.1, it is presumed that breaking glass produces an initial low frequency thump centered around 350 Hz followed by a high frequency component centered at around 6.5 kHz. The 6.5 kHz signal is indicative of glass that breaks as it falls on the floor and shatters producing a tinkling sound. But as pointed out in Abel et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,837,558, one can not always presume that glass once broken will produce the tinkling sound, particularly if the glass pane or window is situated above a carpet in an office or residence. For some time intrusion detectors have made use of the phenomenon that the opening of a door or window produces an infrasonic pressure wave that may be detectedSUBSTITUTESHEET 

by a sensitive microphone or other acoustic transducer having a frequency response in the region of one to five or ten cycles per second. An example of such a device is shown in Yarbrough et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,853,677. The Yarbrough device also includes a glass break detector circuit that is coupled to the same microphone. Either a high frequency or a low frequency event will trigger an alarm if either produces the appropriate frequency spectrum. Furthermore, it has been recognized that the opening of a door or window produces negative-going air pressure in the first instance and acoustic detectors which are intrusion detectors have been

<CLAIMS>
What is Claimed is:
1. A glass break detector for detecting the breaking of a window or the like comprising: (a) an acoustic transducer;
(b) flex detection means responsive to the acoustic transducer for detecting a low frequency positive acoustic wave generated by an inward flex of the window; and (c) alarm means responsive to the flex detection means for generating an alarm.
2. The glass break detector of claim 1, further including high frequency bandpass filter means for detecting high frequency acoustic waves character¬ istic of breaking glass, and logic means for enabling said alarm means when said low frequency positive acoustic wave is detected by said flex detection means during a predetermined time window initiated by said high frequency acoustic waves.
3. The glass break detector of claim 2, further including alarm inhibit means for detecting a low frequency negative acoustic wave and for disabling said alarm means if said low frequency negative acoustic wave is detected during said time window.
4. The glass break detector of claim 3, further including signal processing means responsive to said high frequency bandpass filter means for sensing a preselected parameter of said high frequency acoustic waves and for providing an alarm-enabling signal if said parameter is present after said predetermined time window. 


 5. The glass break detector of claim 4 wherein the preselected parameter is the frequency of the high frequency acoustic waves.
6. The glass break detector of claim 5 wherein said signal processing means comprises frequency- to-voltage converter means having an output whose- ampli¬ tude varies with frequency and window comparator means for providing upper and lower frequency limits for said parameter of said high frequency acoustic waves.
7. The glass break detector of claim 6, further including alarm timing means for activating said alarm when said high frequency acoustic waves are within the frequency limits of said window comparator at a predetermined time after said alarm means is enabled by said logic means.
8. The glass break detector of claim 1 wherein said acoustic transducer is an electret microphone having a wide frequency response.
9. The glass break detector of claim 6 wherein said window comparator is prebiased to be within its upper and lower frequency limits.
10. A method of monitoring the breaking of glass incident to an intrusion, comprising the steps of:
(a) detecting the occurrence of high frequency acoustic waves generated by breaking glass;
(b) detecting a positive low frequency acoustic wave characteristic of an inward flex of the glass within a short time window coincident with the first occurrence of said high frequency acoustic waves; and 


 (c) initiating an alarm after performing steps (a) and (b) .
11. The method of claim 10, further including the step of detecting the occurrence of high frequency acoustic waves that lie within predetermined frequency limits for a time period after the expiration of the time window of step (b) and prior to performing step (c) .
