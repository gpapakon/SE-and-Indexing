<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of soil
stabilization, and more particularly to methods and
apparatus for increasing in-situ either the compressive or
shear strength or both of selected portions of earthen
material.The problem addressed by the invention concerns
stabilizing earthen material by improving its load bearing
strength under conditions of soft or unstable soil and
rock. Such conditions occur and are of concern primarily
in the areas of building support foundations and of steep
rock or soil slopes such as at a building excavation site
or on the side of a hill or mountain.It often occurs that a construction project, be it a
building, a bridge or another structure, is intended to be
placed on land which is made up of unstable, or weak,
foundation soil. The instability may be the result of
inadequate compressive strength of the surface soil, of
soil subject to excess settlement, or of a firm surface
layer which resides over a soft or unstable underlayer.
Conditions sometimes exist where an underlayer contains a
high water content which is susceptible to lateral
shifting or liquefaction. These conditions may be due, in
some circumstances, to land which has been built up as a
result of waste deposits such as landfills, sludge beds,
mine tailings or earth dredged from under a body of water. Soil liquefaction can take place in subterranean
layers of water saturated sand. When the earth is
vibrated such as during an earthquake, the sand particles
lose grain-to-grain contact and are reoriented and
densified to the point where the water pore pressure
causes the subsurface layer to act as a liquid. Since
water has no shear strength, the sand layers lose all
stability causing existing surface structures to
immediately settle, tilt, fall on their sides, or
collapse. Soil liquefaction is the single largest factor
in building destruction during earthquakes.Many methods have been devised over the years to
compensate for such soil conditions. Prominent among
these methods have been the practices of driving load
supporting piles into the ground or constructing an
oversized load supporting foundation capable of "floating"
on the weak soil. Very weak soil cannot be adequately
stabilized with driven piles and, at great expense, must
be excavated and replaced with stable foundation
materials. In the distant past, excavated soil was
sometimes heat treated in processing ovens and returned to
the same site in a more stable condition. This procedure
is not considered economically viable today.Driving piles into the
