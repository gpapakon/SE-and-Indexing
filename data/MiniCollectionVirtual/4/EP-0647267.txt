<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to storing stem cells
without unacceptable loss of cell function.Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which are
pluripotent -- i.e., they can differentiate into cells
which have diverse functional characteristics. They are
not fully differentiated, and they retain the ability to
duplicate. Of particular interest are
lymphohematopoietic stem cells which differentiate into
lymphoid and myeloid cells. Lymphohematopoietic stem
cells include the following cells, as well as many
others: a) cells that are colony-forming cells for
granulocytes/monocytes (CFC-GM); b) cells that are
colony-forming for erythrocytes (BFU-E); c)
colony-forming cells for eosinophiles (CFC-Eo); d)
multipotent colony forming cells (CFC-GEMM; e) immature
lymphoid precursor cells, including precursors of B-cells
and T-cells; and f) pluripotent stem cells. Fig. 1 is a
commercially distributed chart depicting the various
cells including stem cells involved in hematopoiesis.Stem cells are essential for transplantation, for
example, bone marrow transplantation. Typically bone
marrow transplants involve harvesting marrow cells,
washing them with a buffer to remove undesired cells and
material (e.g., T-cells and/or malignant cells), and
suspending in a suitable medium (e.g. RPMI, autologous
serum, and DMSO). The resulting material is either
immediately infused into the recipient or it is
cryopreserved (frozen well below 0°C) for later use.
The same cryopreservation is described in FR-A-2 600 671 for cells, in particularly blood cells,
gametes and embryos.
Peripheral blood stem cells are also used for bone marrow
transplantation. Stem cells are obtained from peripheral
blood by leukapheresis, with similar subsequent
processing. Civin U.S. Patents 4,714,680; 4,965,204; and
5,035,9994 describe a monoclonal antibody specific for an
antigen on human pluripotent lymphohematopoietic stem
cells, and not for antigens on normal mature human
lymphoid and myeloid cells. Tsukamoto et al. U. S.
5,061,620 describe human hematopoietic stem cells, their
separation, characterization, and use.
These and
other rapidly advancing technologies may make bone marrow
transplants and other medical procedures available to a
far larger patient population than can currently receive
this treatment.The lymphocyte family includes lymphoid stem cells
as well as the differentiated cells resulting from them
(T-cells, B-cells, and plasma cells). See Fig. 1. In
various situations, it is desirable to obtain cell
populations enriched in certain lymphocytes
