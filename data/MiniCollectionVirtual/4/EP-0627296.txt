<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of blow-molding a hollow 
vessel, wherein when a nozzle (1) for blowing air is thrust into a parison 

extruded from an extruder to thereby blow the air thereinto, the air 
is blown at least downward into the parison, an opening (8) is formed in 

the parison in the vicinity of a blow nozzle thrust-in portion (7) or thereabove 
after the hollow vessel is shaped by the blown air, and the blown 

air is circulated in the hollow vessel and then discharged therefrom. The 

invention also relates to a blow air cylinder suitably used for said method 
and has a particular construction wherein there is provided the blow 

nozzle (1) having an opening capable of blowing air at least downwardly 
at a rate of 30 % or above of the whole flow quantity of the blown 

air. The invention makes it possible to shorten the cooling time of the 
molded item after blow-molding and produce molded items excellent in 

accuracy of dimensions effectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for blow-molding hollow
container and to a blow air cylinder and, more particularly, to
a blow-molding method which enables one to shorten the time for
cooling moldings immediately after being blow-molded and to
produce moldings having good dimensional accuracy and to a
blow air cylinder-particularly adapted for the blowing method.In molding hollow container from a thermoplastic resin
according to blow molding technique, it has been well known to
pierce the upper portion of a parison having been melt extruded
through a die head of an extruder with a blow nozzle for
introducing blow air, and blow a compressed air into the
parison through the nozzle to thereby press the parison against
the wall of a metal mold for shaping and cooling.The blow nozzle for use in the blow molding is a member
which, upon blow molding, pierces the upper wall of the parison
and which functions to introduce a compressed air through a
blowing inlet or inlets provided at the tip of the nozzle or in
the vicinity thereof, and has a sophisticatedly designed
structure.For example, Japanese Examined Utility Model No. S52-19033
describes the structure of a blow molding nozzle which has a
pin with a sharp tip, said pin having a passageway for blowing
air formed at its center extending in the direction of central
axis and pores connecting to the passageway almost at a right
angle therewith in the vicinity of the tip of the pin and
having one or more linear grooves outside between the tip and
the pores. The form of the nozzle tip for blow molding must be so
designed as to facilitate piercing of the wall of parison
having been extruded in a heated state with the nozzle and
subsequent smooth blowing. The form of the blowing inlets of
the above-described utility model, too, has grooved blowing
inlets toward the tip from this viewpoint.Japanese Unexamined Utility Model No. 57-169510 discloses
the structure of a blow molding nozzle wherein the tip is of a
shape of closed injection needle with an angular cut of 10 to
45 degrees and which has two air-blowing holes formed on the
way to the tip at a right angle with a blow air passageway. In
this utility model, too, the nozzle tip has a specific
structure which facilitates piercing of the wall of a parison
with even a thick nozzle.In a horizontally blow molding method, a blow nozle
pierces the wall of a parison having been heat-extruded into a
metal mold and, after closing the metal mold, a compressed air
(blow air) is introduced into the parison to completely

A blow molding method by horizontal blow molding comprising the steps
of:


piercing the wall of a parison having been extruded by an extruder with a
blow nozzle (1) by moving forward the blow nozzle (1),
introducing blow air via blowing inlets, formed in the upward and
downward direction with the amount of blow air introduced in the direction

towards the bottom, i.e. opposite to the bottle neck being greater, and
after shaping of a hollow container by the blow air forming an opening (8)
in the parson at a position in the vicinity of or above the blow nozzle-pierced

portion and a discharge outlet (13) by moving backward said blow nozzle (1) to
discharge the blow air having circulated inside the hollow container.
The blow molding method as described in claim 1, wherein
said opening is formed by thinning part of the wall of the

parison by blow air till it breaks.
The blow molding method as described in claim 1, wherein
said opening is formed by piercing part of the wall of the

parison with a needle-like member from outside.
Blow molding method as described in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
blowing inlets are formed in the vicinity of the tip of the blow nozzle.
The blow molding method as described in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein
introduction of the blow air is continued after the formation of the opening (8). 
The blow molding method as described in one of claims 1

direction toward the bottom, i.e., opposite to the bottle neck
is 30 % or more of the whole blow air amount.

having the blowing inlets located slightly at the back of the tip portion where the

outer diameter is larger than that at the tip portion and smaller than that at the
central portion and capable of introducing blow air downward in an amount of
