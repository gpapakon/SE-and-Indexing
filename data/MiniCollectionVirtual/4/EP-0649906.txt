<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an immunogenic composition comprising all or part of the amino acid sequence (VIII) of urease, as well as the fragments (VI), (VIII) and (X) of urease, and a process for the production of an immunological complex between fragments and antibodies formed against the protein with urease activity in C. pylori.

<CLAIMS>
A nucleotide sequence corresponding, in accordance with the universal genetic code,
to the sequence included between the amino acids located at positions 206 and 338 of

sequence (VIII).
A nucleotide sequence, 
characterized in that
 it is delimited by two restriction sites of
Figure 2 included between sites H1 and B2 and including sites H1, H2, H3, H4, B1

and B2.
Peptide fragments, 
characterized in that
 they are selected from:

a) the 87 kDa amino acid sequence (X);
b) a fragment of sequence a), said fragment having a urease activity and not being a
peptide fragment of sequence (VI) or (VIII).
A method for producing an immunological complex between a protein with urease
activity expressed by 
C. pylori
 or fragments of the latter in accordance with claim 3
and antibodies, said method being 
characterized by
 bringing said protein or said
peptide fragments into contact with a biological liquid containing said-antibodies.
Use of sequences according to claims 1 and 2 as a probe for detecting the presence of

C. pylori
, in an in vitro detection method, in a sample that is suspected of containing
it.
Use of fragments according to claim 3 in the manufacture of a composition for
inducing the synthesis of specific antibodies against said fragments or an immune

response.
Use of peptide fragments selected from a) the 26 kDa amino acid sequence (VI); b)
the 61 kDa amino acid sequence (VIII); and c) a fragment of one of sequences a) or

b), said fragment having a urease activity, in the manufacture of a composition for
inducing the synthesis of specific antibodies against said fragments or an immune

response.
