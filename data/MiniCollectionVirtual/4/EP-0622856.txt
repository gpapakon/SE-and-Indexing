<ABSTRACT>
An optoelectronic detector includes multilayered semiconductor 
structures (107) that are placed at particular positions in a standing wave pattern in 

order to measure the intensity of the light beams passing through said structures' 
layers. The detector is made sensitive to particular wavelengths by either changing 

the light beams intensity or varying the absorbance of the layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detectors. More specifically, this invention 
relates to wavelength-sensitive optical and optoelectronic detectors. Optical sensors and detectors are increasingly replacing other 
technologies-based detectors in specific applications, such as environmental 
applications, primarily because of their ability to operate in harsh or contaminated 
surroundings. Market penetration of optical detectors in other applications, however, 
has been inhibited by a series of factors. Prominent among those factors is the fact 
that existing optical detectors use many different elements which cannot be 
integrated onto one chip, therefore resulting in bulky, high cost systems. Other 
factors preventing mass-production of optical detectors include a) restriction of their 
wavelength sensitivity to specific spectral regions b) inability to make simple and 
rapid changes to optical detectors in order to make them sensitive to particular 
wavelengths. Other aspects of a related wavelength control technique, as applied to a 
tunable laser, are discussed in the commonly assigned co-pending United States 
patent application, Serial No. 08/055,492 entitled "Tunable Lasers Based on 
Absorbers and Standing Waves". The present invention is directed to a detector whose sensitivity to 
particular wavelengths is measured by the amount of light absorbed by absorbing 
materials placed in a standing wave formed by the interference of light beams. In 
accordance with the invention, the wavelengths to which the detector is sensitive can 
be changed through variations in the sensitivity of those absorbing materials. 
Changes in the sensitivity of those materials can be achieved, for example, by either 
varying the strength of the absorbing materials or changing the weighting of signals 
applied to specific sections of the absorbing materials. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a set of absorbing layers, 
such as semiconductor photodiodes, are configured to act as light intensity detectors 
by being positioned within a standing wave pattern formed by interfering at least two  
 
light beams. Because the positions of the maxima and minima in the standing wave 
pattern depend on the wavelength of the light, the signal from the light intensity 
detectors also varies with the wavelength, thus making a detection system whose 
output depends on the wavelength of the light. Appropriate selections of the 
positions of the light intensity detectors allow particularly useful wavelength 
dependences of the detector
