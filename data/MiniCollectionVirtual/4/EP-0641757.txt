<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel 2-alkoxy- or 
acyloxy-2-aryl-1,3-propanediol or dioxane derivative from 
which a 2-aryl-1,3-propanediol, a precursor or 
intermediate for synthesizing physiologically active 
substances such as felbamate of the formula (A): 
that acts as an antiepileptic, can be derived in a high 
yield, and a process for producing the same. The present 
invention also relates to a process for producing a 2-aryl-1,3-propanediol 
obtained from that derivative, and a 
process for producing a glycol monoether that can serve as 
a starting material for synthesizing the derivative. Hitherto, 2-aryl-1,3-propanediols are produced by a 
process in which an aryl-substituted malonate is reduced, 
a process in which a 2-nitro-2-aryl-1,3-propanediol is 
subjected to catalytic hydrogenation, or a process in  
 
which an ester of 1-hydroxymethyl-1-phenyl acetic acid is 
reduced. As the above process for producing 2-aryl-1,3-propanediols 
by reduing malonates, specifically a process 
in which an expensive metal hydride reducing agent such as 
lithium aluminum hydride is used in a stoichiometric 
amount [U.S. Patents No. 5,091,595 and No. 4,982,016 and 
J. Org. Chem., 54, 1198 (1989)] and a process in which 
hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of copper 
chromite catalyst under application of a pressure of as 
high as 5,000 p.s.i. [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 70, 3121 (1948)] 
are known in the art. These processes, however, have economical and 
operational difficulties from the viewpoint of their 
application in an industrial scale, and have room for 
greater improvements. The process in which a 2-nitro-2-aryl-1,3-propanediol 
is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation (U.S. 
Patents No. 5,072,056 and No. 4,868,327) has the problem 
that nitroalkane derivatives full of danger of explosion 
must be handled. The process in which an ester of 1-hydroxymethyl-1-phenyl 
acetic acid is reduced (U.S. Patent No. 5,239,121) 
also has the problems that the ester of 1-hydroxymethyl-1-phenyl 
acetic acid itself may readily undergo dehydration  
 
to form an active acrylic acid derivative and that 
expensive metal hydride reducing agents must be used. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
compound that can be safely and readily converted into 2-aryl-1,3-propanediols 
serving as precursors for 
synthesizing felbamate, and a process for producing an 
intermediate for synthesizing the compound. The present invention provides a novel 2-alkoxy- or 
acyloxy-2-aryl-1,3-propanediol or dioxane derivative 
represent
