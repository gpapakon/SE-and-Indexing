<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a quick release removable top nozzle 
assembly (12) for use with a nuclear fuel element assembly 

(11). The top nozzle assembly (12) disclosed herein is 
comprised of a top plate member (16), an enclosure frame 

(17) and an adaptor plate (18) having a plurality of spaced 
openings (19) therein. A plurality of tubular insert 

support members (22) each adapted to fit within a selected 
opening (19) in the adaptor plate (18) has an enlarged 

collar section (23) adapted to contact and support the 
underside of the adaptor plate (18). The assembly also 

includes a plurality of quick release joints (26) each 
adapted to fit within another selected opening (19) in the 

adaptor plate (18). Each quick release joint (26) has a 
tubular lock insert (28) which fits within the selected 

opening (19) of the adaptor plate (18). The upper portion 
of the tubular lock insert (28) is provided with a 

circumferential groove (32) below a plurality of lobes 
(33). A locking ring (29) is retained in a recess in the 

top of the adaptor plate (18) by a retainer ring (30). The 
locking ring (29) is adapted to rotatably engage the 

circumferential groove (32) and the lobes (33) whereby 
rotation of the locking ring (29) locks or releases the 

tubular lock insert (28) from the opening in the adaptor 
plate (18) and allows an easy locking or release of the 

entire top nozzle assembly (12) from the rest of the 
nuclear fuel element assembly (11) for easy replacement of 

a fuel rod.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel element assemblies 
for nuclear reactors of the type used in pressurized water 
nuclear power stations. It relates particularly to a quick 
release top nozzle assembly for use in a fuel element 
assembly. The fuel for a nuclear reactor of the type used in 
pressurized water nuclear power stations is a plurality of 
sintered cylindrical (about 10.2 mm. [0.4 inches] in 
diameter) uranium dioxide pellets stacked inside a long 
Zircalloy tube closed at both ends to form a fuel rod. 
Individual fuel rods, are inserted into cells of a series 
of spaced, parallel metal support grids joined together 
with thimble tubes. The grids typically arrange the fuel 
rods into a 14 x 14 or 17 x 17 square array, to comprise a 
fuel element assembly. A series of such fuel element 
assemblies are then arranged in parallel groups to comprise 
the core of the nuclear reactor. When fuel element assemblies are in operation in 
a nuclear power plant, the fuel rods may become damaged and 
result in the escape of radioactive materials into the 
primary coolant in the reactor. If this occurs, the 
utility must remove the fuel element assembly containing 
the damaged fuel rod from the reactor to a separate location 
during the refueling outage, remove the damaged fuel 
rod from its particular grid cell in the fuel element 
assembly, insert a new fuel rod into the grid cell and then 
return the fuel element assembly back to its place in the  
 
reactor core. It is vital that such replacement of a 
damaged fuel rod be accomplished as easily and quickly as 
possible since fuel shuffles are usually on the critical 
path of the refueling outage. Fuel element assemblies are usually provided with 
removable top nozzle assemblies that provide access to the 
individual fuel rods. A typical prior art removable top 
nozzle assembly is shown in FIGURES 1a and 1b, which 
illustrate the prior art removable top nozzle assembly 
unassembled in FIGURE 1a, and assembled in FIGURE 1b. As shown in FIGURES 1a and 1b, the typical prior 
art removable top nozzle assembly 1 was comprised of a 
metal top adapter plate 2 having a bore 3 with a 
circumferential groove 4 adapted to receive a mating 
circumferential rib or bulge 7 on the slotted upper end of 
a metal tubular nozzle insert 5. The tubular nozzle insert 
5 was retained in the bore 3 of the top adapter plate 2 by 
a ribbed metal lock tube 6 inserted into the top of the 
nozzle insert 5, as shown in FIGURE 1b. The lower end of 
the nozzle insert 5 was provided with a
