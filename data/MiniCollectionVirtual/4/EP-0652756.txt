 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND USE OFDILINOLEOYLPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE (DLPC) FOR TREATMENT ANDPREVENTION OF CIRRHOSIS AND FIBROSIS IN THE LIVERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention is in the field of prevention and treatment of liver cirrhosis.Description of the Prior ArtLiver fibrosis, regardless of its cause, is characterized by marked accumulation of extracellular matrix in the perisinusoidal space (Rojkind M, Giambrone MA, Biempica L. Collagen types in normal and cirrhotic liver. Gastroenterology 1979; 76: 710-719; Murata K, Kudo M, Onuma R, Motoyama T. Changes of collagen types at various stages of human liver cirrhosis. Hepato- Gastroenterology 1984; 31: 158-161). Many efforts have been made to identify the cellular sources of extracellular matrix proteins in intact liver. Some observations have suggested that parenchymal liver cells play a central role in the production of interstitial collagen (Martinez-Hernandez A. The hepatic extracellular matrix. I. Electron immunohistochemical studies in normal rat liver. Lab Invest 1984; 51: 57-74; Sakakibara K, Igarashi S, Hatahara T. Localization of type III procollagen aminopeptide antigenicity in hepatocytes from cirrhotic human liver. Virchows Arch [A] 1985; 408: 219-228; Chojkier M, Lyche KD, Filip M. Increased production of collagen in vivo by hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis. Hepatology 1988; 8: 808-814). Other experiments, however, have led to the conclusion that hepatic extracellular matrix production is largely a function of mesenchymal liver cells (Milani S, Herbst H, Schuppan D, Hahn EG, Stein H. In situ hybridization for procollagen types I, III and IV mRNA in normal and fibrotic rat liver: evidence for predominant expression in nonparenchymal liver cells. Hepatology 1989; 10: 84-92; Friedman SL, Roll FJ, Boyles J, Bissell DM. Hepatic lipocytes: the principal collagen-producing cells of normal rat liver. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1985; 82: 8681-8685). Lipocytes (fat-storing or Ito cells), the principal cells in the Disse space of the liver, were found to synthesize and release different types of collagen (Clement B, Grimaud JA, Campion JP, Deugnier Y, Guillouzo A. Cell types involved in collagen and fibr-onectin production in normal and fibrotic human liver. Hepatology 1986; 6: 225-234), and they are considered to play an important 

role in the development of alcohol-induced liver fibrosis (Minato Y, Hashamura Y, Takeuchi H. The role of fat-storing cells in
