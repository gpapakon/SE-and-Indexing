<ABSTRACT>
There is described a novel processor-based ABIST circuit 
(20) that generates self-test patterns for high speed SRAM 

macros with short access and system cycle times. It is 
comprised of three main blocks. First, a conventional 

address generator block (20-A) to generate the CNOOP, 
STADD, STBA0E and STWA0E signals. The two latter signals 

are used in the control logic main block (20-B), which 
generates four control signals TS0, TS1 and their complements 

CTS0, CTS1. These control signals are determined by 
the type of test patterns and the ABIST cycle. The role of 

the control logic main block (20-B) is to force a proper 
signal sequencing of the processing main block (20-C) 

during the ABIST mode. Processing main block (20-C) has 
the key role of generating the STDATA, the EXDATA, and the 

STRW signals, in response to the said control signals. The 
processing main block (20-C) first includes three data 

generators (26-1 to 26-3), that are designed to be very 
fast from a circuit point of view. The three data generators 

prepare the STDATA and STRW signals to be used on a 
following cycle. It further includes three latch pairs (27-1 

to 27-3), one for each data generator, to output the 
STDATA and STRW signals one cycle later Finally, the 

STDATA signals are stored in two latch pairs (28-1, 28-2) 
to generate the corresponding EXDATA signals one cycle 

later.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to integrated circuits of the memory 
type, such as stand-alone SRAMs or logic arrays with embedded 
SRAM macros, provided with built-in self-test capabilities 
for logic and memory fault detection and fabricated 
in semiconductor chips. It more particularly relates 
to a new processor-based ABIST (Array Built-in Self-Test) 
circuit. As memories get faster, more complex, and denser, 
there is an increasing demand on ABIST structures offering 
high speed and high test coverage, while consuming minimal 
area on the semiconductor chip. For sake of illustration, Fig. 1 shows the block diagram 
architecture of a state of the art SRAM macro 10 provided 
with an ABIST unit 11. A similar architecture is described 
in Ref. D1: US-A-5 173 906 assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention. The functional units shown in Fig. 1, 
either form a part of a stand-alone SRAM or the SRAM macro 
of a logic array of an integrated circuit chip. In the 
latter case, the chip may include a plurality of such 
macros, each being provided with its own dedicated ABIST 
unit. The said integrated circuit chip is part of a wafer 
fabricated in a very large scale integration (VLSI) semiconductor 
technology and is designed according to level-sensitive 
scan design (LSSD) rules. As known for those ordinary skilled in the art, the SRAM 
macro 10 of Fig. 1 has three basic operating modes. The 
first one is the SYSTEM mode, according to which the SRAM 
macro 10 is in normal operation, i.e. where the memory 
unit 12 is either read or written, using the data-in signals 
DATAIN1 to DATAINM, the SRAM address signals ADDIN1 
to ADDINP, and the read/write control signal R/WIN (wherein  
 
M and P are the respective bit widths of the data-in 
bus DATAIN and the SRAM address bus ADDIN). The second 
mode is required because of the LSSD construction: the 
SCAN mode which is used for initializing/analyzing (SCAN-IN/SCAN-OUT) 
all the data of the latch pairs, which are 
used extensively in the SRAM macro architecture of Fig. 1, 
to form the LSSD chain. Finally, the third mode is the 
ABIST mode, in which the memory unit 12 functionality is 
tested. It is a self-test which is first performed in the 
manufacturing environment, before the chip is commercially 
released. A slightly different, more relaxed self-test is 
performed while the chip is incorporated in a system, for 
example at the customer location, and thus in the system 
environment. As a result, the ABIST mode is used in different 
environments referred to
