<ABSTRACT>
The roller seam welding machine (1) is provided with a contour-controlled tool table (2) for the receptacle (3) to be welded. The table is driven in a known manner by a pinion (4) and a pantograph (16). In order to also be able to weld three-dimensionally running welding flanges (6) of the receptacle (3), the welding rollers (10, 11) are arranged on a vertically traversable head (14) of the machine. The welding rollers can thus be traversed in accordance with the rising or falling welding flange (6). Owing to the fact that the tank is moved only in a conventional manner in a horizontal plane and in addition the welding rollers are moved vertically, the possibility of also welding three-dimensionally running welding flanges of receptacles with high precision irrespective of weight or size of the receptacles is obtained in a simple manner.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the roller seam welding of a container, in 
particular a motor vehicle fuel tank, in which the welding 

flange does not lie in one plane, characterized in that the 
motions executed by the tank during welding are entirely in 

one plane, a contour-guided table being provided to hold the 
tank and an arm driven in at least two axes being provided 

for the table, and in that when welding the non-level sections 
of the welding flange the axes of the welding rollers 

are shifted, as a unit, with respect to the movement plane so 
that the welding rollers follow the profile of the welding 

flange. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
welding rollers are mounted on a vertically traversable and 

tiltable head. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
drive to a support arm section is via a parallelogram linkage. 
Resistance roller seam welding machine for carrying out 
the process according to Claim 1, characterized by a workpiece 

table (2) positively driven along a contour thereof for 
motion in a horizontal plane, a two-part driven arm (16) 

mounted away from the workpiece table drive axis (U) and determining 
the position of the workpiece table with respect to 

the welding rollers (10, 11), and by welding rollers which 
are traversable, as a unit, in a vertical direction (Z) during 

the welding operation. 
Resistance roller seam welding machine according to 
Claim 4, characterized in that the rollers are tiltable, as a  

 
unit, about a horizontal axis during the welding operation. 
Resistance roller seam welding machine according to 
Claim 5, characterized in that the rollers are mounted on a 

carriage (14) which is vertically traversable and tiltable 
about a horizontal axis. 
Resistance roller seam welding machine according to any 
one of Claims 4 to 6, characterized in that the arm (16) has 

a hinge (19) and a drive mechanism for the arm section (18) 
extending from the hinge to the workpiece table, the motor 

(21) of the said drive mechanism acting on the arm section 
via a parallelogram linkage. 
Resistance roller seam welding machine according to 
Claim 7, characterized in that the drive motor (21) for the 

forward arm section (18) is fixed to the machine in the 
region of the opposite end of the arm (16) to that which 

carries the table.
