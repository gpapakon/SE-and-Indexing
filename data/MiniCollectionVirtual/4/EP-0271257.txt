<ABSTRACT>
The specification describes thermal ink jet (TIJ) 
processes and device structures produced thereby wherein either 

heater resistors or heater resistor-diode combinations are 
constructed vertically upward from a common supporting substrate. 

A lower or first metal level conductor pattern provides one part 
of an X-Y matrix multiplex connection to the resistor/diode 

components, and a second, upper metal level conductor pattern 
forms the seco
nd part of the X-Y matrix multiplex connection. In 
this manner, the multiplex drive circuitry for the TIJ printhead 

resistors/diodes may be fabricated (integrated) directly on the 
thin film resistor (TFR) printhead substrate. Additionally, the 

second level metal conductors which overlie the resistive heater 
and diode elements also serve as a barrier shield to ink 

corrosion and cavitation wear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to thermal ink 
jet (TIJ) printing and more particularly to new and improved 
thermal ink jet printhead device structures employing vertical 
resistors and a metal ink barrier having improved resistance to 
ink corrosion and cavitation wear. In the field of thermal ink jet printing, it has become 
a common practice to provide heater resistors on a common substrate 
and align these heater resistors with individual ink 
reservoirs and corresponding ink ejection orifices in an outer 
nozzle plate. These heater resistors are physically defined and 
electrically driven by conductive traces which are photolithographically 
formed on the surface of a suitable resistor layer 
material, such as tantalum-aluminum. These heater resistors have 
been traditionally isolated from the overlying ink reservoirs by 
highly inert dielectric materials such as silicon carbide and 
silicon nitride. This type of thermal ink jet printhead is described, 
for example, in the Hewlett Packard Journal, Vol. 36, No. 
5, May 1985, incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the current flowing in this type of printhead 
flows laterally in the conductive trace material and then down 
and again laterally through the resistive tantalum aluminum layer 
where no trace material appears and then back up and again 
laterally through the conductive trace material.  
 EP-B-0154515 (Xerox Corporation) discloses a thermal 
ink jet printing device comprising a multilayered lateral 
heating resistor in contact with an ink reservoir. The 
lateral heating resistor comprises a resistor layer of doped 
polycrystalline silicon, a dielectric isolation layer atop 
the resistor layer and a protective layer of tantalum atop 
the dielectric isolation layer to protect the dielectric 
isolation layer from ink corrosion and cavitation wear. 
Electric current to heat the resistor flows laterally 
through the resistor layer via electrodes connected across 
the resistor layer. The electrodes are electrically 
insulated from the protective layer of tantalum. According 
to one embodiment of the thermal ink jet printing device 
disclosed in EP-B-0154515 the above resistor is formed on a 
substrate of highly doped, conductive silicon. A thin, 
lightly doped p-type epitaxial layer separates the resistor 
from the substrate. The conductive substrate serves as one 
of the electrodes supplying electric current to the 
resistive layer, contact with the resistive layer being made 
through a small phosphorus-doped region of the epitaxial
