<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control unit for fitting in a replaceable manner onto an apparatus lower part (30), which is equipped with switching elements, of a service apparatus (30, 40) which is used for the direct connection of loads. An interface to make contact with the apparatus lower part is provided, as well as a contact rocker (42), which acts as a switch and/or momentary-contact switch and in whose region at least one command receiving element (45) for passing commands onto an electronics unit (E) is located, which electronics unit (E), for its part, acts on the switching elements (8) of the apparatus lower part (30) in a manner corresponding to the contact rocker (42), but as an alternative thereto. To this end, the electronics unit (E) is fitted with its own evaluation electronics device (1), which is separated from the apparatus lower part (30), is arranged, for its part, in the control unit, and is connected to a receiving stage (4) which is provided in order to detect the control signals coming from the command receiving element (45). An interface logic element (6) is provided for the output to functional groups of the apparatus lower part (30), and plugging onto the apparatus lower part (30) is carried out via a mechanically and electrically common interface which is constructed such that a plurality of control units (40) having a different control function can be combined with a plurality of apparatus lower parts (30) which are suitable for different switching, control or actuating tasks, such that autonomous service apparatuses having a different method of operation are produced.
