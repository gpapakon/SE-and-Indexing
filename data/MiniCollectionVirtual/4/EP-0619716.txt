<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of contrast media in
electrical impedance imaging.Electrical impedance imaging (EII), also referred to as
electrical impedance tomography and applied potential
tomography, is a medical imaging technique that was brought
to a practical level during the 1980's, in particular by the
Sheffield group of B H Brown, D C Barber et al.The technique involves generation of images indicative of
spatial, and if desired temporal, variations in electrical
impedance or resistivity; images which, when of human or
animal subjects, can provide information about the structure
and functioning of the imaged tissues. The technique is
attractive as a medical diagnostic tool since it is
non-invasive and does not involve exposing the patient to
potentially harmful ionizing radiation, it does not require
the administration of radioactive species and it does not
require the generation of strong, highly uniform magnetic
fields.In the version of EII developed by Brown, Barber et al., an
array of evenly spaced electrodes is attached to the body
about the region of interest, a very low alternating current
is applied successively between adjacent pairs of electrodes
and the potential difference between all other pairs is
determined. Image construction is effected using a back
projection technique.Alternative approaches to data collection do exist and are
described in the literature.Thus for example reference may be made to Seagar et al. IEE

therein.Spatial variations revealed in electrical impedance (EI)
images may result from variations in impedance between
healthy and non-healthy tissues, variations in impedance
between different tissues and organs or variations in
apparent impedance due to anisotropic effects resulting for
example from muscle alignment. Thus for example the
difference in impedance between body fat and muscle tissue
is such that the two should be differentiable in static EI
images. Dynamic imaging techniques may be used to follow
gastric emptying, heart and lung function and the like.Static imaging is
