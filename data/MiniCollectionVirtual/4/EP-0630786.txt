<ABSTRACT>
For determining the coefficient of friction between a motor vehicle tyre and a road surface by means of a circuit (1), the vehicle speed, the speed of rotation of a wheel (2-5) and the wheel brake pressure (p) are continuously measured. The angular velocity of the wheel is calculated from its speed of rotation and the coefficient of friction mu  for a selected wheel determined from the angular velocity and the brake pressure by means of a recursive estimating algorithm. It is advisable to use an estimating algorithm according to the method of least squares. The coefficient of friction determined as a function of the wheel slip serves for more precise control of an antilock system (10) or a traction control system.
