<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a FIFO buffer used as
a buffer for buffering signals waiting for processing in
the signal processing or as a buffer for absorbing
collision.in an interconnection network of an exchanger.
and more particularly, to a photonic frequency division
multiplexed FIFO buffer used in an optical computer or an
optical exchanger for processing high speed optical
signals.WO 91/04642 discloses a buffer which uses a plurality of loop
shaped optical waveguide delay lines for storing time
multiplexed signals. Time multiplexed signals are input in
frames to a first stage loop shaped optical waveguide delay
line serving as buffer and a buffer control means controls
each of the delay line buffers. The loop shaped optical
waveguide delay lines are connected in series between a
single input highway and a single output highway.EP 0 411 562 A2 describes a fast packet and frequency switch.
A certain number of different wavelength optical carriers are
modulated by serial information flows organized into packets.
The packets are phase-realigned and their label is converted
upon the control of external processes designated to set up
break connections. Then frequency conversion of the optical
carriers assigned to the packets is carried out and the
packets are recombined into a unique fibre by a passive
recombination network in order to be stored into a loop
shaped optical waveguide delay line serving as an optical
loop memory. This document does not relate to several stages
of loop shaped optical waveguide delay lines as the
aforementioned document.In the proceedings, International Switching Symposium 1990,
28 May - 1 June 1990, Vol. 1, pages 67 - 74, Stockholm, SE,
XP130823, A. de Bosio et al. "Electro-optical switching node
based on fast packet and frequency switching techniques" it
is described that the combined utilization in a switching
node of fast packet and frequency division switching
techniques seems the best way to accelerate the optical
technology integration in the evolving B-ISDN and to assure
high switching node performance. The electro-optical ATM
switching node comprises a label conversion subsystem, a
memory subsystem including a frequency converter and a space-frequency
switching subsystem.As a photonic buffer using a wide bandwidth optical
delay line, and especially as a photonic FIFO buffer for
connecting signals from a plurality of input highways to a
single output highway, there has been a configuration as
shown in Fig. 1, in which a one input one output FIFO
buffer is
