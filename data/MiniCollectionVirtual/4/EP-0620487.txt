exposed photographic silver halide material containing 
at least one dye image-forming colour coupler which

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic
processes and is more particularly concerned with the
processing of colour photographic paper using redox
amplification chemistry.Redox amplification processes have been
described, for example in British Specification Nos.
1,268,126, 1,399,481, 1,403,418 and 1,560,572. In
such processes colour materials are developed to
produce a silver image (which may contain only small
amounts of silver) and then treated with a redox
amplifying solution (or a combined developer-amplifier)
to form a dye image.The developer-amplifier solution contains a
colour developing agent and an oxidising agent which
will oxidise the colour developing agent in the
presence of the silver image which acts as a catalyst.Oxidised colour developer reacts with a colour
coupler to form the image dye. The amount of dye
formed depends on the time of treatment or the
availability of colour coupler and is less dependent
on the amount of silver in the image as is the case in
conventional colour development processes.Examples of suitable oxidising agents include
peroxy compounds including hydrogen peroxide and
compounds which provide hydrogen peroxide, eg addition
compounds of hydrogen peroxide; cobalt (III) complexes
including cobalt hexammine complexes; and periodates.
Mixtures of such compounds can also be used.A particular application of this technology is in
the processing of silver chloride colour paper,
especially such paper with low silver levels. Redox amplification processes can be carried out
in one a number of ways, for example, in a single
developer/amplifier (DEV/AMP), in a developer followed
by a peroxide (or other amplification agent) amplifier
(DEV, AMP) containing no developing agent, in an
amplifier followed by a developer or developer/amplifier
(AMP, DEV or AMP, DEV/AMP) or in a
developer followed by a developer/amplifier (DEV,
DEV/AMP).When the development and amplification process is
to be carried out the ways described above there are
chemical stability advantages to holding at least some
of the developing agent and oxidant in separate baths.
However there is a difficulty in achieving a
sufficiently high Dmax.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a method of processing photographic paper
using redox development and amplification processes
which produce improved results.In accordance with one aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a method of forming a
photographic colour image by a redox amplification
method from an imagewise exposed photographic
