<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a silicon-containing 
material which exhibits sufficient hydrophilicity 

and sufficient electropositivity to bind DNA from a 
suspension containing DNA and permit elution of the DNA 

from the material. Generally, the hydrophilic and 
electropositive characteristics are expressed at the 

surface of the silicon-containing material. Preferred 
silicon-containing materials of the present invention 

include boron silicate, aluminum silicate, phosphosilicate, 
silica carbonyl, silica sulfonyl and silica 

phosphonyl. The silicon-containing materials of the 
present invention are particularly useful in processes 

for purification of DNA from other cellular components. 
In these processes, a suspension of cellular components 

is placed in contact with the silicon-containing 
material, the silicon-containing material is washed to 

remove all cellular components other than DNA which are 
bound to the material, and the bound DNA is eluted from 

the material. Several of the silicon-containing 
materials are capable of binding and eluting DNA using 

only water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
purification of DNA by solid phase extraction, and more
specifically to silicon-containing materials which are
capable of binding DNA and eluting DNA under suitable
conditions.The preparation of high-purity double-stranded (ds)
plasmid DNA, single-stranded (ss) phage DNA, chromosomal
DNA and agarose gel-purified DNA fragments is of
critical importance in molecular biology. Ideally, a
method for purifying DNA should be simple, rapid and
require little, if any, additional sample manipulation.
DNA rendered by such a method should be immediately
amenable to transformation, restriction analysis,
ligation or sequencing. A method with all of these
features would be extremely attractive in the automation
of DNA sample preparation, a goal of research and
diagnostic laboratories. Typically, the preparation of
plasmid DNA from crude alcohol precipitates is
laborious, most often utilizing CsCl gradients, gel
filtration, ion exchange chromatography, or RNase,
proteinase K and repeated alcohol precipitation steps.
These methods also require considerable downstream
sample preparation to remove CsCl and other salts,
ethidium bromide and alcohol. Similar arguments extend
when using any of these methods for purifying DNA
fragments. A further problem with these methods is that
small, negatively-charged cellular components can co-purify
with the DNA. Thus, the DNA can have an
undesirable level of contamination.DNA can also be purified using solid phases.
Conventional solid phase extraction techniques have 
utilized surfaces which either (1) fail to attract and hold
sufficient quantities of DNA molecules because of surface
design to permit easy recovery of the DNA molecules during
elution, or (2) excessively adhere DNA molecules to the
surface, thereby hindering recovery of the DNA molecules
during elution. Conventional surface materials which cause
these problems when utilized in solid phase extraction include
silica surfaces such as glass and Celite. Adequate
binding of DNA to these types of surfaces can be achieved
only by utilizing high concentrations of chaotropes or alcohols
which are generally toxic, caustic, and/or expensive.
For example, it is known that DNA will bind to
crushed glass powders and to glass fiber filters in the
presence of chaotropes. The chaotropic ions typically are
washed away with alcohol, and the DNAs are eluted with low-salt
solutions or water. Importantly, RNA and protein do
not bind. However, a serious drawback in the use of crushed
glass powder
