<ABSTRACT>
A form-fill-seal type combined bag maker and packaging 
machine uses a longitudinal sealer to seal together 

mutually overlapping side edges of an elongated bag-making 
material wrapped around a loading cylinder (91) in a 

tubular form. The longitudinal sealer has a sealing unit 
(20) with a heater (28) supported by a mobile member (56) 

which can be selectably moved linearly or rotationally such 
that the sealing unit can be not only correctly positioned 

but also properly oriented with respect to the loading 
cylinder currently installed on the packaging machine. The 

mechanism for moving the sealing unit is supported on an 
elongate member (2) rotatably supported by the packaging 

machine so as to be easily moved away when the loading 
cylinder is removed and replaced by another of a different 

kind.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a longitudinal sealer for a form-fill-seal 
combined bag maker and packaging machine 
(hereinafter simply referred to as a packaging machine), and 
more particularly to a device for adjusting the position of a 
heater in such a sealer. The invention further relates to a 
packaging machine incorporating such an improved sealer. Consider, for example, a so-called vertical pillow type 
packaging machine which uses a former to bend an elongated web 
of thermoplastic sheet into a tubular form, while pulling it 
down over the peripheral surface of a loading cylinder through 
which articles to be packaged are dropped. The mutually 
overlapping side edges of the tubularly formed sheet are 
sealed together by a heater in a vertical (or longitudinal) 
sealer, and a horizontal (or transverse) sealer disposed below 
the loading cylinder seals the top edge of a bag and the 
bottom edge of the next bag at the same time. The vertical 
sealer is usually provided with a vertically extended endless 
belt such that the filling and sealing of the bags can be 
carried out continuously.  
 Packaging machines of this type are required to be able to 
produce bags of different shapes and sizes, depending upon 
both the nature and the amount of the articles to be packaged. 
For this reason, many kinds of formers with different shapes 
and sizes are customarily provided and they are selectively 
used with a packaging machine. Japanese Patent Publication 
Tokkai 5-124606 discloses a packaging machine, of which the 
position of its sealing heater can be changed, depending on 
which of many available formers is installed. Since there are 
fluctuations in the shape and size of the formers due to 
production errors, the position of the sealer may require 
additional adjustments both in the radial and tangential 
directions. Moreover, the sealer may have to be tilted, even 
after it is correctly positioned, such that its tip will be 
accurately opposite to the surface of the former. Thus, whenever a different former is installed for producing 
bags of a different kind, it becomes necessary not only to 
remove the endless belt and to adjust its position but also to 
carry out adjustments of the position of the sealing heater. 
In particular, since a prior art vertical sealer is usually so 
structured that its heater is axially supported by a shaft in 
its exterior, the tangential position of the tip of the heater 
with respect to the former is affected as the heater is 
rotated against this support shaft. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A longitudinal sealer for a packaging machine, 
comprising a sealing unit (20) including a heater (28); a 

mobile support member (56) supporting said sealing unit; 
and Y- adjusting means (45) provided with a first mechanism 

for selectably moving said support member (56) 
translationally in a Y-direction, a second mechanism for 

rotating said support member (56) around an axis (29) extending 
through said sealing unit and a switching means (53) for 

switching from one mechanism to the other 
mechanism. 
The longitudinal sealer of claim 1, wherein said Y- 
adjusting means (45) is unitized with said mobile support 

member (56) and comprises a mutually parallel pair of 
shafts (46,50) each extending in said Y-direction; and 

switching means for selectively causing said shafts 
to rotate at the same rate or at different rates 

proportional to the distance from said sealing unit (20); 
wherein said mobile support member (56) supports said 

sealing unit (20) at one end thereof in an X-direction 
perpendicular to said Y-direction and is connected with 

said pair of shafts (46,50) through engaging means (59,60) 
engaging with said shafts. 
The longitudinal sealer of claim 2 wherein said Y- 
adjusting means further comprises a frame structure (37) 

which rotatably supports said pair of shafts (46,50); a
