<ABSTRACT>
A projector (1) has at least one projection objective lens (2) and a carriage (4) associated to the projection objective lens (2) movable approximately parallel to the optical axis (3) of the projection objective lens (2) from a first working position (projection position) to a second working position (exchange position) within the projector (1). The carriage (4) carries at least one holder for the translucent original picture to be projected (slide crib 7). At least one condenser system for lighting the translucent original picture is associated to each projection objective lens (2). The condenser system has at least one lamp (10), a concentrating reflector (9), at least one condenser lens (11) and at least one thermal insulation for the original picture and the slide crib (7). The condenser system comprises a first subassembly (lamp carrier 8) fixed in the projector and containing at least the lamp (10), the concentrating reflector (9) and one condenser lens (11), and a second subassembly arranged on the carriage (4) containing at least the slide crib (7).

<CLAIMS>
Projector (1) having at least one projection objective 
(2), a carriage (4) which is associated with the 

projection objective (2) and movable substantially 
parallel to the optical axis (3) of the projection 

objective (2) out of a first operating or projection 
position into a second operating or slide-changing 

position inside the projector (1) and which carries at 
least one holding device or slide stage (7) for a 

transilluminable image copy which is to be projected, and 
having at least one condenser system associated in each 

case with a projection objective (2) for illuminating the 
transilluminable image copy, the condenser system 

comprising at least one lamp (10), a concave mirror (9), 
at least one condenser lens (11, 14) and a thermal 

screening device for the image copy and the holding 
device or slide stage (7), 
characterized in
 that the 
condenser system comprises a first subassembly (8), which 

is fixed in the projector and comprises at least the lamp 
(10), the concave mirror (9) and a condenser lens (11), 

and a second subassembly, which is disposed on the 
carriage (4) and comprises at least the holding device or 

slide stage (7). 
Projector according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the 
optical axis (12) of the first subassembly (8) is 

disposed at an angle to the direction of movement of the 
carriage (4) and that the carriage (4) further comprises 

a mirror (13), which is provided on the carriage (4) at 
an angle midway between optical axis (12) and the 

direction of movement of the carriage (4). 
Projector according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the 
optical axis (12) of the first subassembly (8) is 

disposed at right angles to the direction of movement of 
the carriage (4).  

 
Projector according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in
 
that the mirror (13) is a cold-light mirror. 
Projector according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the 
cold-light mirror (13) is the thermal screening device 

for the image copy. 
Projector according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in
 that the second subassembly disposed on 
the carriage (4) additionally comprises a further 

condenser lens (14).
