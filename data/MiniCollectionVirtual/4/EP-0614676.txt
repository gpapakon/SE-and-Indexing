<ABSTRACT>
An implantable catheter apparatus for self-administration 
of drugs to the penis of a human patient 

comprises
 

   an elongated catheter (10) having a flexible wall 
(20) surrounding a lumen (22)

 
   the catheter having

 
   a distal portion (31) having a closed distal end 

and adapted to be placed within the corpus 
cavernosum of the penis of a human patient, a 

proximal portion (14) adapted to be implanted in 
the body of the patient at a location remote 

from the penis, and an intermediate portion 
connecting the proximal and distal portions and 

adapted to be implanted within the body of said 
patient,

 
   resealable injection port means (16) located at the 

proximal end providing fluid access from a source of fluid 
to the lumen,

 
   the distal portion of the catheter being provided 

with longitudinal slits (36) to permit fluid to flow from 
the lumen to the exterior of said catheter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a device for use
in the treatment of men afflicted with impotence. More
particularly, it relates to an improved apparatus for
self-administration to the penis of drugs that can
provoke an erection.Administration of vasodilator drugs directly to the
penis has been investigated as a method for treating
penile erectile dysfunction. However, inasmuch as the
procedure requires inserting a needle into the base of
the penis, the procedure tends to be both frightening and
painful to the patient. Furthermore, repeated
administration of drugs by direct injection can lead to
undesirable side effects such as hematoma, infection and
eventually fibrosis. An additional problem is the
reluctance of some patients to administer the drugs to
themselves. Consequently, they have the injections made 
at clinics with the accompanying evident obstacles to convenient or normal
sexual relations.Accordingly, a need has continued to exist for a safe, effective, painless
and convenient method for a patient afflicted with impotence to inject himself
with a vasoactive drug to achieve a normal erection without risking the side
effects of local injection.GB-A-2192135,
which is used as a basis for the preamble of claim 1,
discloses implantable apparatus for self-administration of
vasoactive drugs to the human penis, the apparatus comprising a distal portion
comprising a flexible tube having a closed distal end, which is formed with at
least one opening, a proximal portion adapted to be implanted in the body at a
location remote from the penis and having a proximal end, and an intermediate
portion connecting the distal and proximal ends and adapted to be implanted in
the body.According to the present invention there is provided an implantable
catheter apparatus for self-administration of drugs to the penis of a human patient
comprising:
a catheter having
a flexible wall surrounding a lumen, a distal portion adapted to
be placed within the corpus cavernosum of the penis of a human
patient, said distal portion having a closed distal end, a proximal
portion adapted to be implanted in the body of said patient at a
location remote from said penis, said proximal portion having a
proximal end, and  an intermediate portion connecting said proximal and said
distal portions and adapted to be implanted within the body of
said patient, and resealable injection port means located at said proximal end providing
fluid access from a source of fluid to said lumen, characterised by:
said distal portion of said catheter

<CLAIMS>
An implantable catheter apparatus for self-administration of drugs
to the penis of a human patient comprising:


a catheter (10) having

a flexible wall (20) surrounding a lumen (22),
a distal portion (31) adapted to be placed within the corpus
cavernosum of the penis of
 a human patient said distal portion
having a closed distal end (30);
a proximal portion (14) adapted to be implanted in the body of
said patient at a location remote from said penis said proximal

portion having a proximal end (12), and
an intermediate portion (15) connecting said proximal and said
distal portions (14, 31) and adapted to be implanted within the body of

said patient, and
resealable injection port means (16) located at said proximal end
providing fluid access from a source of fluid to said lumen, characterised by:


said distal portion (31) of said catheter (10) having a plurality of longitudinal slits
(36) piercing said wall of said catheter said slits (36) being at different distances from

said distal end (30) of said catheter (10) such that adjacent slits (36) have an overlapping
staggered configuration.
The catheter apparatus of claim 1 additionally comprising a
circumferential close-fitting sheath (24) covering said slits (36), said sheath (24) having a

proximal end (25) attached to the outer surface of said catheter (10) proximal to said slits (36),
and a free distal end (27) positioned distally of said slits (36).
The catheter of claim 2 wherein said distal end (30) of said catheter (10) is
provided with a transverse hole (32) that does not intersect the lumen (22) of said catheter (10).
The catheter of claim 2 additionally comprising flexible cuff means (40)
located near said distal end (30) for suturing said catheter (10) to surrounding tissues.
The catheter of claim 4 additionally comprising a circumferential
node (42) located distally of said cuff (40).
The catheter of claim 2 containing a pair of said slits (36).
The catheter of claim 2 wherein said slits (36) have a length of about 5
millimeters.
The catheter of claim 2 wherein said port means comprises a
pierceable septum (16) sealing said proximal end (12) of said lumen (22). 
The catheter of claim 2 additionally comprising a blade member (34)
removably secured to said distal end (30).
