<ABSTRACT>
The process according to the invention comprises a first step in which the material which is intended to form the support (12) for a tarsia decoration is worked by means of a digitally controlled (DC) milling machine which is programmed in such a way as to obtain, by means of diamond-tools acting on the surface to be decorated, areas which reproduce, by means of grooves (14) and notches, a decoration pattern. A slab (11) constituted by the material forming the decoration is then worked by means of a DC milling machine in order to form on the slab, in relief, a decoration pattern. Said slab (11) is then placed on the material (12) to be decorated, in the grooves of which a suitable bonding agent is previously laid down, in such a way as the reliefs are embedded in said grooves. Then, the upper portion of such a sandwich is removed, normally by means of a longitudinal cut, thereby freeing the decorated material, which is successively smoothed and polished.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR TARSIA-WORKING OF MARBLE, GRANITE ETC.* * * * * The present invention relates to a process for tarsia-working of materials such as marble, stone or grani te.More particularly, the present invention relates to a process allowing a tarsia decoration of any shape and/or size to be obtained on blocks, panels or slabs made of stone-like material in a quick and economical way, said process being able to be continuously reproduced on industrial scale.Furthermore, the invention relates to a material such as marble, stone or granite provided with a tarsia decoration obtained by means of such process.The invention may be mainly applied in the field of marble, stone, granite and similar materials workin industry. Several methods are known in the art for obtaining tarsia decorations on a surface.According to the traditional method for tarsia- working of stone-like materials, which is known since ancient times, the decoration supporting surface is hand-milled in order to obtain grooves and/or notches suitable for housing the elements forming the decoration, which are individually obtained by manually cutting and milling small material blocks.Each of the elements forming the decoration is then laid down on the supporting surface and glued to the lat ter .Finally, the decorated surface is further treated, 

 by means of polishing, sandblasting operations etc..This working method involves several disadvantages and drawbacks, since it is extremely dispersive in terms of time and costs which are needed for laying down the 5 decorated surface.According to another method, which is mainly used for obtaining relatively thin tarsia-decorated slabs, the slab to be decorated is firstly worked by means of an automatic machine of a type which is commonly- Q designated as "water-jet machine", which deeply digs the stone-like material by means of a very thin water jet which is mixed with suitable abrasive powders and which is sent at a very high pressure, until an element having a predetermined shape may be detached from the slab.15 The process is continuously repeated for each slab and decoration element, and finally the elements are laid down on a suitable support and assembled on it like a mosaic by glueing the elements to the support by means of resins or bonding agents.20 Finally, the decorated slab undergoes suitable treatments, such as smoothing, polishing etc..This method also involves several drawbacks and disadvantages in terms of time and costs, which are essentially due to the necessity of individually

CLAIMS
1. Process for tarsia-working of stone-like materials as marble, stone, granite or the like, in which a first supporting element (12) accomodates on its visible surface at least a second element (11) forming a decorative tarsia pattern, characterised in that said first element is machined by means of a digitally controlled (DC) machine tool in order to form on it a series of grooves and/or notches (14), in that a suitable bonding agent is laid down on said grooves and/or notches, in that said at least a second elemnt is machined by means of a digitally controlled (DC) machine tool in order to form on it, in relief, a decorative pattern or portions of a decorative pattern, in that said at least a second element is embedded in said grooves and/or notches, and in that the supporting material belonging to said at least a second element is removed from the formed block, thereby enabling the sight of the decorative pattern formed on said first element .
2. Process according to claim 1, characterised in that said first element is configurated as a block, or a tile, or other .
3. Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, characterised in that said suitable bonding agent is constituted by a glue or by a resin.
4. Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, characterised in that said DC machine tool is provided with diamond or hard-metal cutters in order to form said notches and/or grooves and said decorative pattern in relief on said first and at least a second element.
5. Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, 


characterised in that the final product is smoothed and/or polished and/or sandblast.
6. Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, characterised in that a plurality of second elements (11) provided with areas in relief suitable to be accomodated in said grooves and/or notches are superimposed to said first element (12).
7. Process according to anyone of the preceding claims, characterised in that the surface on which the tarsia working is carried out is flat and/or curved.
8. Product constituted by a tarsia-worked stone-like material as marble, stone, granite or the like, in which a first element forming a support is provided with a tarsia decorative pattern constituted by at least a second material, characterised in that said product is obtained by means of a process according to anyone of the preceding claims.
