<ABSTRACT>
A process which consists in introducing inside a pipe 
(1) which carries substances which eventually leave a 

meltable residue, a cylindrical travelling element or pig (2) 
made of low density high elasticity foam having added to its 

body, for example packed in cavities or soaked within its 
pores, a mixture of reagents (3) which after a certain period 

of time will cause a highly exothermic reaction to occur so 
that by displacing the pig (2) past the meltable residue 

within pipe (1), said residue will melt and will be carried 
to a place from which they will be removed together with the 

pig.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a process for removing from 
inside a pipe accumulated matter which can be melted to be 
later dragged by a travelling element moving inside the pipe. 
It applies specifically to the use of a polymeric cylindrical 
element driven by a fluid flowing in the pipe. This travelling element (from now on referred to as a 
pig) is heated either by means of a chemical reaction or 
through a physical-chemical effect. Inside a pipe in which there is a flow of liquid 
products, deposits are created which reduce the effective 
liquid flow area and cause problems for the flow. These 
problems are all the more serious when the flow through these 
pipes is of crude oil or its refined products often over 
large distances. To remove or to clean such debris it is 
very common to introduce, at a certain point, an object or 
device (named a pig) which fits the pipe internal dimensions. 
This pig is moved by the fluid (liquid or gas) pressure, 
flowing (preferably at a high speed) and dragging (scraping) 
the deposit to a place in which it is removed together with 
the "travelling" object. However, such a process presents 
certain drawbacks concerning the shape and constitution of 
the "travelling" device. One of the most serious drawbacks 
is the lack of clearance between the device and the inner 
pipe walls, as the device (or pig) is designed to scrape 
these walls in its movement with a risk of becoming jammed or 
destroyed. These problems may require the pipe disassembly 
for the removal of the pig. More recently pigs or scrapers have been designed which 
are made of a polymeric foam which is of very low density as 
compared to the existing foams. This can be seen in EP-A-0581616. 
Besides being of reduced costs, such a pig can be 
introduced and driven along pipes subject to large diameter 
variations, thanks to its large elasticity and wear resistance.  
 In the case of paraffinic oils, when there is a 
paraffinic wax accumulation on the walls, it would appear as 
an immediate solution to the operators of the pipe (or, more 
specifically an oil pipeline) to cause melting of the deposit 
by means of a local heating. However, to succeed in heating 
such a pipe is sometimes not an easy task since, in general, 
one is dealing with pipes of considerable extent in which the 
accumulation points are not easily accessible. The prior art has made very little progress in this 
field, except in very few cases of electrical heating at 
points of easy access and, even so, in pipes of small extent, 
although

<CLAIMS>
A process for removing accumulated deposits in 
pipes by means of a travelling element, said 

travelling element being a scraper or cylindrical pig (2) 
made of a low density, high elasticity polymeric foam; 

characterised by adding to said pig (2) reagents which, by 
chemical reaction or physical-chemical modification cause a 

highly exothermic reaction; immediately afterwards introducing 
the pig together with the reagent into a pipe (1); and 

causing the displacement of said pig (2) by means of a 
flowing fluid so that, by displacement of the pig, the 

reagents added to the pig are reacted and generate heat so 
that, as said pig (2) passes by a meltable deposit accumulated 

within said pipe (1), the heat of reaction causes the 
melting of the deposit and carries it to an opening of the 

pipe (1) wherefrom pig and deposit are taken out. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the 
reagents (3) are placed inside a cylindrical cavity within 

the pig (2). 
A process according to claim 2, wherein the 
reagents (3) are added inside an annular cylindrical cavity 

in the body of the pig (2). 
A process according to either of claims 2 and 3, 
wherein the reagents are packed in containers which are 

easily ruptured by pressure at the moment they are introduced 
in the cavity of the pig (2). 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the 
reagents (3) are soaked within pores of the body of the pig 

(2). 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein a standard scraper pig (4) is introduced immediately 

after the pig (2) which contains the reagents (3) causing the 
exothermic reaction.  

 
A process according to claim 6, wherein before 
the standard scraper pig (4) is introduced in the pipe but 

after the introduction of the pig (2) which contains reagents 
(3), an intermediate bed (5) is introduced which is made up 

of chemical reagents which together with the other elements 
constitute a cleaning train. 
A process according to any of claims 2 to 5, 
wherein the reagents which are to be brought into contact are 

previously mixed at the very moment of their placement inside 
the cavity of the pig (2) and of the placement of said pig 

(2) inside the pipe (1) for the displacement of the pig (2) 
throughout the pipe.
