<ABSTRACT>
A brushless motor which includes a stator (9) and a rotor 
(8) rotatably supported inside the stator. The rotor has a rotor 

yoke (10) formed by laminating a large number of steel plates, 
the rotor yoke has an even number of magnetic pole portions 

(8a) protruding outward, and a field magnet (11) is fitted to 
each of the magnetic pole portions or every other magnetic pole 

portions. A magnetic sensor (16) is disposed within the range 
in which the sensor (16) can directly detect a magnetic flux 

leaking outside from an end face (8b) of the rotor (8) and is 
less affected by irregular fluxes near the rotor end face (8b), so 

that this sensor can detect a peak point of a flux density 
around the rotor. A magnetic sensor is disposed within the 

range where the influences of the irregular fluxes are small. A 
magnet (17) to be detected is fitted to the rotor end face (8b), 

and a magnetic sensor (16X) for one direction and a magnetic 
sensor (16Y) for the other direction are disposed near the trajectory 

of rotation of the magnet to be detected, and these sensors 
are disposed in the opposite direction to the rotating direction 

of the rotor in the arrangement such that they are deviated 
from one another by predetermined angles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a brushless motor which has a
rotor having field permanent magnets inserted into a rotor
yoke made of laminated steel plates and as magnetic sensor
disposed to oppose to the end face of the rotor.Generally known conventional brushless motors consist of
a rotor which has a plurality of field permanent magnets
inserted into a rotor yoke made of laminated steel plates,
and a stator which has a magnetic pole portion opposed to the
outer peripheral face of the magnetic portion of the rotor
with a small gap therebetween. A motor of this type is, for
example, disclosed in chapter 4 of "The Principles and the
Basis of Brushless DC Motor" of the Japanese technical book
"DC Servo-Motor for Mechatronics" (published: June 21, 1982,
Japan).This type of brushless motor is proposed, to detect a
rotational position of the rotor, to adhere to an end face of
the rotor magnet piece to be detected for specifying a
rotational position of the rotor, to dispose a magnetic
sensor near the trajectory of rotation of the magnet piece to
be detected, and to use the magnetic sensor to detect
magnetism of the magnet piece to be detected, thereby
detecting the rotational position of the rotor. Fig. 37 shows a vertical sectional view of the above
brushless motor having the magnet pieces. A brushless motor
51 has a pair of housing members 53, 54 fastened with bolts
52, and these housing members 53, 54 rotatably support a
rotatable shaft 57 with ball bearings 55, 56. To the
rotatable shaft 57, a rotor 58 is fixed, and one end of the
rotatable shaft 57 is structured to protrude from the end
face of the housing member 53 to externally transmit a
rotary force of the rotor 58. A stator 59 is disposed
around the rotor 58 and held between the housing members 53,
54.The rotor 58 consists of a rotor yoke 50 which has many
steel plates laminated, and a plurality of field permanent
magnets 61 which are inserted into the rotor yoke 50. The
stator 59 consists of a stator yoke 62 made of laminated
steel plates, and stator coils 63 wound on the stator yoke
62. A part of the inner peripheral face of the stator yoke
62 forms a magnetic pole portion 59a of the stator, and the
stator magnetic pole portion 59a is opposed to the outer
peripheral face of a magnetic pole portion 58a of the rotor
58 with a small distance therebetween.A magnet piece 64 to be detected is adhered to an end
face 58b of the rotor 58. A magnetic sensor board 66 having
a plurality of magnetic sensors 65 disposed is fixed to the 
housing member 53 near the
