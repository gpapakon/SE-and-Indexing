<ABSTRACT>
Processing apparatus are well-known in which 
photosensitive materials are pass from one chamber to 

another during processing. In some arrangement, the 
material passes from one chamber to another through a 

wall structure dividing the two chambers. However, 
there may leakage of processing solutions between 

adjacent chambers through the wall structure. 
Described herein is an improved through-wall structure 

(100) which reduces the amount of leakage. The wall 
structure (100) comprises upper and lower wall portions 

(20, 22), and a pair of sidewall portions which define 
a passage opening. A pair of parallel contacting 

rollers (28, 30) are placed into the opening to guide 
the material from one chamber to the next. The rollers 

(28, 30) have a compliant sublayer (37, 39) which 
elastically deforms in a radial direction and an outer 

layer (41, 43) made from a material having a low 
coefficient of friction to allow the rollers (28, 30) 

to be easily rotatably driven and providing a fluid 
seal between the rollers (28, 30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processing
apparatus and is more particularly concerned with such
apparatus which include through-wall structures for
separating processing chambers within the apparatus.In the field of film processors, such as
those for X-ray film, a sheet of photosensitive
material typically undergoes a number of sequential
processing steps; that is, at least one developing
step, one fixing step, and a washing operation. In
each of these steps, the photosensitive material is
brought into contact with a processing liquid
(developer, fixer solution, and so forth) to produce a
desired chemical interaction with the film substrate or
to wash chemical residue away from the substrate
surface.Because it is not desirable to intermix
processing fluids of differing chemistries due to their
generally antagonistic nature, it has been known to
place quantities of different processing fluids in
separate, discrete chambers positioned within a
processing apparatus.In processors of the prior art, a sheet of
photosensitive material is passed through a series of
open topped containers, each containing a quantity of
processing fluid, by a series of rollers over a
generally sinusoidal transport path into and out of
each open topped container. A typical processor of
this kind is shown in US-A-4 994 837.There are a number of disadvantages with a
processor of this type. First, the lengthy transport
path impedes the ability to realize a high processing
throughput. Exposing a film substrate to atmospheric
conditions between processing chambers is not conducive
to processability because no chemical interaction takes 
place during exposure. In other words, exposure to the
atmosphere is nonproductive, or "dead" time.In addition, the photosensitive material is
more susceptible to scratching or marring due to the
stresses induced as the material remains in substantial
contact with the multiple sets of rollers which are
required to traverse a serpentine transport path in a
processor of this type.A number of attempts have been made to deal
with the problems described. Processing apparatus
using more direct transport paths, extending directly
through the walls of adjacent closed tank chambers
containing processing liquid have been utilized. In
processors of this type photosensitive material enters
a chamber partially full of a processing liquid through
an opening in the chamber wall, the opening being above
the level of the processing liquid which is contained
therein. The material is then brought into contact
with the
