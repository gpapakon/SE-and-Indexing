<ABSTRACT>
Subscriber apparatus with connections for special additional appliances are known. Digital telephone sets whose components may be interconnected by a digital bidirectional bus are also known. A new subscriber apparatus has one or several modules interconnected by a bidirectional bus which conveys both digital and analogical signals. The modules carry out different telecommunication functions, such as telephone, telefax and others. Each module contains a storage with a module-specific control program. The control unit may control the whole subscriber apparatus. When a new module is connected to the bus, an identification is attributed thereto which determines at the same time the start address for the module-specific control program. This modular design makes operation substantially more user-friendly. The universal bus allows the extension of the subscriber apparatus with particularly powerful modules which will be later developed. This new modular subscriber apparatus can be used in all communication networks for telephonic connections and provides the user with a versatile combination of devices of any kind for the transmission of information.

<CLAIMS>
Modular subscriber apparatuses which have a connection
(AL) to a telecommunications network and whose modules are

connected via plug devices to a bus (B) which comprises
lines for the signals of the telecommunications network,

for data, addresses and control signals and also for the
voltage supply, a module implementing a certain performance

feature, in particular a speech control system or a call
number storage or a terminal appliance, in particular a

telephone set, telephone answering machine or telefax
machine, characterized in that each module has a memory

which contains a module-specific control program and a list
containing the identifications (K) of all the modules

connected to the same bus (B), in that the start address of
the memory for the module-specific control program is fixed

at the same time by the identification (K) of a module, in
that, as a result of the user actuating control elements, a

module is selected whose control unit takes over the
control of the bus (B), and in that the modules which have

not been selected perform only functions in which they do
not access the bus (B).
Modular subscriber apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterized in that plugs and sockets are provided at

mutually opposite side faces of the modules, as a result of
which modules can be plugged together without lateral gap

and at least the front and top of the modules form a flat
face, or in that, to connect 
two modules, a cable is used,
as a result of which modules can also be set up remotely

from one another.
Subscriber apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that each module is assigned by the

currently active control apparatus when it is put into
service on the bus (B) an identification (K) which no other

modules connected to the same bus (B) have. 
Subscriber apparatus according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized and configured in that, for

the purpose of data exchange on the bus (B) connecting all
the modules, the control unit of a second module newly

activated by the user first outputs its own identification
(K) via a control signal line of the bus (B), as a result

of which the control of the bus (B) is requested by a
hitherto active first module, in that the control unit of

the first module hitherto active is deactivated and outputs
the control of the bus (B) as a result of the

identification (K) of the newly activated second module
being outputted by the first module via the control signal

line, in that the newly activated second module only then
transmits signals via the bus (B) in that inactive modules

output no signals to the control signal line as soon as an
identification (K) has been detected for the first time on

the control line, and in that inactive modules can again
output their identification (K) again via the control

signal line as soon as an identification (K) has been
detected for the second time on the control signal line.
