<ABSTRACT>
An image processing apparatus for controlling an 
execution order of a plurality of processing operations 

comprises an input device for inputting a plurality of 
jobs for image processing, a storage device for storing 

the plurality of jobs input by the input device, a 
processing device for executing the plurality jobs 

stored in the storage device and a controller for 
sorting an execution order of the plurality of jobs 

stored in the storage device in accordance with times 
required for processing of each of the jobs and/or 

whether contents of each of the jobs correspond to an 
image input or an image output, wherein the controller 

executes each of the jobs according to the execution 
order of the plurality of sorted jobs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to control of an
execution order of a plurality of processing operations
in an image processing apparatus with multiple
functions.In recent years, a multiple functions apparatus,
which performs facsimile communication using a scanner
and a printer of a digital copying machine, or
developing code data from a computer into bit map data
and printing out the developed data using the printer
of the digital copying machine has become commercially
available.In such a multiple functions apparatus, at least
three of, e.g., a copying function, a facsimile
function, a printer formatter function, an image filing
function, an image memory function, and the like are
incorporated in one unit.In a multiple functions image processing apparatus
with the above-mentioned arrangement, the respective
functions share a scanner and printer, thus realizing
space saving and reduced cost. Furthermore, upon execution of each function in the
multiple functions image processing apparatus,
input/output processing of image data during execution
of functions utilising a scanner and a printer is
executed using a half-duplex video bus which also
provides easy control and reduced cost.However, in order to allow a plurality of functions
to share a single scanner and printer, and since input
and output image data between copying function processing
and another function processing are transferred using the
half-duplex communication type video bus, for example,
image data developed by a printer formatter processing
unit cannot be output to the printer simultaneously while
the scanner is being used for image reading processing
for facsimile transmission. In addition, image data
searched by the image filing function cannot be printed
out simultaneously while document data received by the
facsimile function is being printed out.It is a concern of the present invention to provide
an image processing apparatus which can eliminate the
above-mentioned drawbacks.European Patent Specification No. EP-A-0469865
discloses a method of automatically sorting jobs in a
print queue according to the characteristics of the job
to be printed and the selected printing priority. The
sorting is carried out by user selectable sort options.Japanese Patent Abstract No. JP-A-04305777 discloses
a job sorting system which either executes short jobs
with priority or executes jobs in accordance with a user 
request.Neither of these prior documents solves the problem
set out in the earlier part of the present specification.In accordance with a

<CLAIMS>
An image processing apparatus comprising:

image input means (1) for inputting image data;
image output means (2) for outputting image data;
image data storage means (9, 904, 905);
input means (1,4,6,7) for inputting a plurality of
job instructions, each of the job instructions

independantly relating either to an image input operation
wherein the image input means (1) inputs an image or an

image output operation wherein the image output means (2)
outputs an image;
storage means (9) for concurrently storing the
plurality of job instructions input by said input means;

and
processing means (10) for processing respective
image input and impage output jobs corresponding to each

of the stored job instructions,

   characterised by further comprising:

discrimination means (10) for discriminating whether
each individual stored job instruction corresponds to an

image input operation or an image output operation; and
control means (10, Figs. 17a-17c) for sorting the
stored job instructions into an execution order, the

execution order being such that when the stored job
instructions comprise a number of input jobs and a number

of output jobs, then jobs relating to image input 
operations and jobs relating to image output operations

are alternately processed in accordance with the output
of said discrimination means.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in
that said control means is adapted additionally to sort

the execution order on the basis of the time taken for
individual jobs.
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in
that said control means (10) sorts the execution order

by estimating the time taken for each of the individual
jobs on the basis of the page number information included

in each of the job instructions.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that said control means (10) sorts the

execution order of all stored job instructions except for
a job which is currently being processed.
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein the image input device (1) is an image

reader, and the image output device (2) is a printer.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims and including an image input device in the form

of a facsimile unit (4) and a format unit (8) for 
converting data received from a computer into a visual

image. 
A method of processing a plurality of sets of image
data representing a plurality of jobs, which jobs include

both image input jobs and image output jobs,
the processing being carried out on the

basis of a plurality of different job instructions, each
of the job instructions independently relating either to

an image input operation wherein an image input means (1)
inputs an image or an image output operation wherein an

image output means (2) outputs an image, and in which the
execution order of the jobs is controlled in accordance

with the nature of the job instructions,

   characterised in that the method comprises:

concurrently storing the plurality of job
instructions in a storage means (9);
discriminating whether the nature of each individual
job instruction corresponds to a job relating to an image

input operation or a job relating to an image output
operation; and
controlling the execution order of each of the
individual job instructions such that when the job

instructions include a number of jobs relating to image
input operations and a number of jobs relating to image

output operations, then input and output jobs are
alternately carried out in accordance with the result of 

the discrimination.
A method according to claim 7, wherein additional
control of the execution order is carried out on the

basis of the time taken for individual jobs, so that
input and output jobs are carried out alternately, with

shorter jobs given priority.
A method according to claim 7 or claim 8, wherein
the control does not include a job which is currently

being processed.
A method according to claim 8, wherein the control
on the basis of time is carried out on the basis of the

number of information pages included in each of the job
instructions.
A method according to any of claims 7 to 10, in
which the discriminating is also carried out in

accordance with which of a number of input or output
devices is to be used for the job corresponding to each

of the job instructions.
