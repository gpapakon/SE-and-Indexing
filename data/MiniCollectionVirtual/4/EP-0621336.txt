<ABSTRACT>
The control of a fermentation unit which operates with a horizontal fermenter (4) in plug-flow mode is extremely difficult, in particular when a high proportion of dry matter is employed. Previously, influence was only exerted on the biogenic degradation in the fermenter by returning (2) a proportion of the digested material from the outlet (8) of the fermenter to the inlet (3) of the fermenter. According to the invention, the control method is now supplemented by measuring the pH and the dry matter content at various positions (21) of the fermenter (4) and, on the basis of this measurement, controlling the fermenter in such a way that the measured data lie within certain stipulated ranges. In addition, the pH and the dry matter content can be adjusted by feeding press water laden with methane bacteria from the digested material to inoculation sites (20) in the fermenter.

Process for the control of a fermentation plant, in which the biogenic 
waste to be fermented is chopped up and preheated and supplied to a fermenter, 

where biogenic decomposition takes place by means of methane bacteria, the 
fresh, biogenic waste to be fermented at the inlet of the anaerobic fermenter 

being inoculated in controlled manner with the substantially fermented, 
methane bacteria-enriched, biogenic waste from the fermenter outlet and in the 

fermenter the biogenic waste is decomposed in plug flow operation with controlled 
intermixing and accompanied by the formation of biogas and is then 

supplied to an aerobic rotting process, characterized in that the methane 
bacterial decomposition is monitored and adjusted at several points of the 

feed path in the fermenter at least with respect to the pH-value and dry 
matter fractions and the flow rate is controlled as a function of these 

measured values on the one hand by the supply of biogenic waste to be fermented 
and on the other by the recycling of largely fermented, biogenic waste. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the partly decomposed, 
biogenic waste is compressed prior to introduction into the aerobic rotting 

process and then through the supply of the bacteria-containing compression 
water a desired dry matter desired value and a desired pH-value are set in 

the anaerobic fermenter. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the pH-value and 
dry matter fraction is determined in the feedline (2) in the vicinity of a 

feed and mixing section (2') at a measuring point (21') and correspondingly 
set by the supply (18') of methane bacteria-containing compression water. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the content of the 
anaerobic fermenter is circulated stepwise and without advance. 
Process according to claim 2 and 3, characterized in that the compression 
water is introduced into the fermenter (4) in the vicinity of the different 

measuring points (20). 
Process according to claim 2 and 5, characterized in that the compression 
water, prior to introduction at the corresponding point in the fermenter, is 

heated approximately to the temperature prevailing there.  
 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that at the measuring 
points (20) the temperature prevailing there is also measured. 
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that the fermenter (4) is 
controllably heated segmentwise in the longitudinal direction.
