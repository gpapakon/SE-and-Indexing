<DESCRIPTION>
 HYDANTOIN DERIVATIVES HAVING AN INHIBITORY ACTIVITY FOR FARNESYL TRANSFERASETECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a novel hydantoin derivative represented by the following formula (I) which shows an inhibitory activity against farnesyl transferase, and thus can be used as an effective therapeutic agent against anti-proliferative diseases, such as resfenosis, Rheumatitis arthrititis and particularly cancer:[Formula I]or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in which Ri, R2, R3 and R4 are defined as described below.The present invention also relates to a process for preparation of the compound of formula (I), and to an anti-cancer composition comprising the compound of formula (I) as an active ingredient.BACKGROUND ARTMammalian Ras proteins act as molecular switches in the signalling events associated with cell growth and differentiation. The ras proto-oncogene family consists of three members, N-, K-, and H-ras, which code for highly homologous four types of proteins; i.e., H-, N-ras 

proteins of 189 residues and two isomorphic K-ras-4B and K-ras-4A proteins of 188 and 189 residues, respectively. The chemical basis for the switch mechanism involves cycling of the protein between the inactive (off) guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound state and the active (on) guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound state (Bourne, H.R.; Sanders, D.A.; McCormick, F.; Nature, 1991, 349,117). Biochemical and structural studies have shown that point mutations of the residues 12, 13, and 61, positioned in the neighborhood of phosphoryl group of GTP, resulting in the decrease of guanosine triphosphatase activity are associated with many human cancers, particularly, pancreatic cancer, urinary bladder carcinoma, colon cancer, etc. (Bos, J.L., Cancer Res., 1989, 49, 4682).Ras protein is synthesized as a cytosolic precursor that is ultimately localized to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane after a series of posttranslational modification (Gibbs, J.B., Cell 1991, 65, 1). These series of biochemical modifications, by changing the electrical charge state or spacial structure to increase the hydrophobicity allow Ras protein to attach to cell membrane more easily. The first and obligatory step in the series is the addition of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine residue of the C-terminal CAAX motif (C, cysteine; A, usually aliphatic residue; X, any other amino acid) in a reaction catalyzed by farnesyl protein transferase (FTase). This modifications is essential for Ras function, as demonstrated by the inability of Ras
