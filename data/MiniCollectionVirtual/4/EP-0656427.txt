<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oil-tempered wire
improved in spring formability and efficiency of nitriding
treatment, and also to a process for producing the oil-tempered
wire.Since oil-tempered wires have poor surface lubricity,
high-speed spring formation therefrom causes seizing on the
wire surface or yields coiled springs having fluctuations in
free length or coil diameter. There has been another
drawback that a so-called stick slip noise is produced to
impair the working environment. These drawbacks become more
serious as the wire strength becomes higher.For overcoming such problems, the following attempts
have conventionally been taken:
(i) A 2 to 5 µm-thick oxide film consisting mainly of
magnetite (Fe3O4), which has relatively high lubricating
properties among iron oxides is formed, on a wire surface to
thereby improve the lubricity of the wire surface.(ii) The bending part of a coiling machine is rotated
with the progress of the wire to reduce the coefficient of
friction between the wire and the bending part to thereby
enable high-speed spring formation.However, the technique of improving lubricity by
means of an oxide film (attempt (i) above) is defective in
that since the necessary oxide film thickness is large (e.g.,
2 µm or more), debris of the remaining surface layer
consisting mainly of the oxide film scatter during spring
formation to impair the working environment. In addition,
this technique has had another drawback that oxidation occurs
occasionally at grain boundaries during the formation of an
oxide film and this causes microcracks on the wire surface
during spring formation, resulting in reduced fatigue
properties of the spring.In JP-A-58 135 719 a surface film of uniform thickness of
art least 2 µm is formed on the wire to be coiled to spring consisting
of a lubricating agent residue and an oxide generated at the
time of heat treatment.In general, nitriding treatment is conducted after
spring formation for the purpose of improving the fatigue
property of the spring. The thicker the oxide film, the
lower the efficiency of the nitriding treatment (as described
in JP-A-5-177544). (The term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application.) There
has hence been a problem that a step for removing the oxide
film prior to the nitriding treatment is necessary or much
time is required for the nitriding treatment.An object of the present invention is to provide an
oil-tempered wire and a process for producing the same, in
which the above-described prior
