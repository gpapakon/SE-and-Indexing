<ABSTRACT>
A quantitative viral assay comprises capturing virus particles, releasing viral RNA or DNA and, where necessary, reverse transcribing viral RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA), amplifying the viral DNA or cDNA by a nested multi-stage PCR reaction, capturing the PCR product using an immobilised binding partner specific to a binding agent introduced in the PCR product and quantifying the captured PCR product. The assay is particularly useful in the determination of viral load and in the determination of the relative proportions of different viral forms, for example as produced by a point mutation. The assay may be used to follow the development of drug resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
 QUANTITATIVE VIRAL ASSAY The present invention relates to a new viral assay which may be used either to measure the amount of virus in a serum sample or to determine the relative proportions of virus in closely related viral forms, such as wild-type and a mutant caused by a point mutation at a single base in viral DNA or RNA.Existing methods for estimating the amount of virus present in a serum sample rely on serial dilution in tissue culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems. However known systems are labour intensive and time consuming. This renders them unsuitable for the investigation of the large number of specimens which are generated in clinic trials and in routine testing of patients subject to or suffering from viral infection. Similarly, existing methods for the quantification of point mutations are inconvenient and cumbersome in that they involve the sequencing of whole DNA fragments, which is-... inconvenient and impractical on a large number of samples.A new quantitative assay has now been devised which can be used for both these applications, which possesses significant advantages in terms of convenience and the time involved. This may render the assay suitable for use in clinical trials, for example in determining whether a virus is developing resistance to a drug by following both the proportion of mutated virus compared to unmutated (wild type) virus and the quantity of virus in the serum removed from a patien .Accordingly the present invention provides a quantitative viral assay which comprises: 

(a) capturing virus particles from serum and removing the residue of the serum;(b) releasing viral RNA or DNA from the virus particles;(c) where necessary, reverse transcribing viral RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) using a transcription primer having a sequence complementary to a portion of the RNA sequence;(d) amplifying the viral DNA or cDNA by a nested multi-stage polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using in a first stage a first pair of PCR primers and in the final stage a second pair of PCR primers complementary to portions of the DNA sequence which lie within a region defined by the portions of the DNA sequence complementary to the first pair of- PCR primers; one of the second pair of PCR ~ primers being tagged with a specific binding agent capable of binding to a specific binding partner; and where reverse transcription is used to obtain complementary cDNA, the first pair of PCR primers having sequences complementary to portions of the cDNA which define a region such that the
