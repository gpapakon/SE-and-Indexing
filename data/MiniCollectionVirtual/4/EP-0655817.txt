<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a screw-in insertion device (1) for use on collars or housings (14). This insertion device (1) consists of an insertion sleeve (2) onto which a cap nut can be screwed. Located in the interior of the insertion sleeve (2) is a compression sleeve (6) by means of which an annular seal (consisting of sealing material and compression washers arranged at the sides) is deformed until the required adhesion of the sealing material to the sealing surfaces with which contact is to be made is achieved. Pressure equalisation subsequently takes place automatically, so that no permanent pressure is exerted on the inserted cable (11).

<CLAIMS>
Screw-fitting entry device at entry openings of 
sleeves or housings having a compressible annular seal, 

an entry sleeve (2) with an external thread (9) being 
firmly and tightly arranged at the entry opening of the 

sleeve or of the housing (14), a union nut (3) with an 
internal thread (8) being able to be screwed onto the 

entry sleeve (2), a compression sleeve (6) being arranged 
in the union nut (3) in such a manner that an annular 

groove (7) is formed in relation to the internal thread 
(8) of the union nut (3), into which groove the entry 

sleeve (2) enters when the union nut (3) is tightened, a 
longitudinally split annular seal (4, 16) having an 

internal diameter coarsely matched to the cable (11) to 
be inserted being pushed in the entry sleeve (2) as far 

as an annular stop (10), and the annular end face (27) of 
the compression sleeve (6) being able to be pressed 

against the end of the annular seal (4, 16) with the aid 
of the union nut (3), characterized in that the entry 

sleeve (2.1) and/or the union nut (3.1) and/or the 
compression sleeve (6.1) are longitudinally split and, 

following assembly, can be fixed to one another in a 
complementary manner, the longitudinally split annular 

seal (4, 16) being arranged between two annular, 
longitudinally split compression washers (5, 15).
