A nutrient concentrate for stimulation and as a growth aid for the
accelerated cultivation and growth of hydrocarbon-consuming

microorganisms for their use in the biological degradation of organic
components, containing water-soluble and/or oil-soluble compounds of

phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) present in admixture with other water-soluble
and/or oil-soluble organic mixture components which are at least

partly endowed with nutrient character for the growth of the microorganisms,
characterized in that it is in the form of a liquid water-based

preparation and contains an ester of phosphoric acid as emulsifier and P-source
and 10 to 40% by weight of urea as N-source.
A nutrient concentrate as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it
contains biocompatible surfactants except for glycerol esters as a further

component, but preferably nonionic surfactants.
A nutrient concentrate as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that it contains


10 to 40% by weight of phosphoric acid ester as emulsifier,
10 to 40% by weight of urea and
water to 100% by weight.
A nutrient concentrate as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that it contains


20 to 30% by weight of phosphoric acid ester as emulsifier,
15 to 30% by weight of urea and
0.5 to 5% by weight of nonionic surfactants and
water to 100% by weight.
A nutrient concentrate as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that it contains phospholipids, alkyl phosphates and/or alkylether

phosphates as the phosphoric acid ester.
A nutrient concentrate as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that it contains glycerophospholipids as the phosphoric acid ester. 
A nutrient concentrate as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that it contains P-containing hydrolysis products of glycerophospholipids as

the phosphoric acid esters.
A nutrient concentrate as claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that it contains alkyl glycoside compounds prepared from preferably linear

fatty alcohols containing 8 to 24 carbon atoms and mono- and/or oligoglycosides;
partial sugar esters of C
8-24
 monocarboxylic acids, sorbitan
esters, biosurfactants of biological origin, such as sophorose lipid,

trehalose lipid and lipopeptides, as nonionic surfactants.
A process for the remediation of polluted soils or waters, characterized
in that a nutrient concentrate of the type claimed in claims 1 to 8 is

diluted with water to a volume of 10- to 50-fold and is incorporated in the
contaminated soil sample one or more times in a quantity of 5 mg to 200

mg per g of pollution.
The use of the nutrient mixtures claimed in claims 1 to 9 in
combination with concentrates of microorganisms which are capable of

degrading hydrocarbon compounds and which are preferably of natural
origin.
The use claimed in claim 10, characterized in that microorganism
concentrates which have been isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated

localities of natural origin are used.
The use claimed in claims 10 and 11, characterized in that
concentrates of microorganism strains which form biosurfactants as

metabolism products are used.
The use claimed in claims 10 to 12, characterized in that the nutrient
mixtures are used for the remediation of soils, fresh water and/or salt water,

more particularly for the elimination and/or accelerated degradation of oil
contamination and/or other contamination based on hydrocarbon

compounds on land and/or water and for the cleaning of working

equipment, pipes, large vessels, including marine tankers and the like. 
The use of the nutrient mixtures claimed in claims 10 to 13 in
combination with microorganism concentrates capable of degrading

hydrocarbons for the disposal of oil-wetted cuttings from biological land-supported
or offshore drilling, for example from the development of

valuable geological occurrences.
The use claimed in claim 14, characterized in that the nutrient
mixtures are used for the biological disposal of invert drilling muds based

on oleophilic carboxylic acid esters, oleophilic carbonic acid esters,
oleophilic ethers and/or oleophilic alcohols.
