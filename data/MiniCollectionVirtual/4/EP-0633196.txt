<ABSTRACT>
A vent assembly (24) for the seal (12) of a food container (10) 
including a vent opening (30) in the seal panel (14) at least partially 

surrounded by an upperwardly opening recess (26) with the vent 
opening and recess being below the plane of the upper face of 

the panel. A vent cover (34) pivotally mounts to the seal and, 
when selectively closed over the vent hole, partially overlies 

the recess to allow for engagement of fingers with the cover 
in the recess for upwardly opening of the cover. The closed 

cover does not project above the plane of the top panel of the 
seal as to interrupt the planar nature thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Food storage containers, conventionally of an 
appropriate plastic or synthetic resinous material such as 
polypropylene, are frequently also used as convenient 
containers for the heating or reheating of foodstuffs within a 
microwave oven. However, in order to accommodate the buildup 
of internal pressures during heating, the seal of the 
container must be removed or at least partially released. 
Complete removal of the seal is often not desirable because of 
potential spillage problems, an exposure of other goods within 
the oven to fumes emitted from the container stored goods, and 
the like. Similarly, a partial opening of the seal, normally 
by an upward stripping of one section of the frictionally 
engaged edge flange, is inexact, particularly when dealing 
with round containers and seals, and could lead to an 
accidental release of the entire seal as a result of internal 
pressures.  The present invention comprises a seal for use with 
a storage and/or microwave heating container which 
incorporates a separate covered vent. The vent is selectively 
openable without disruption of the seal, that is without 
requiring partial release or removal of the seal. The vent is integrally formed within the top panel 
of the seal and so oriented as to provide no projection or 
raised interruption in the planar upper face of the seal 
panel. This is of significance in that storage containers of 
the general type herein involved are conventionally stacked, 
one upon the other, thereby requiring substantially planar 
upper and lower stacking faces. The vent cover, notwithstanding the flush 
positioning thereof when closed, is easily grasped and opened, 
even by the infirm or elderly. In addition, to facilitate 
cleaning, the cover, including the hinge assembly thereof, is 
removable from and remountable to the seal. Structurally, the vent assembly is incorporated in 
the planar top panel of the seal, adjacent the peripheral 
flanged edge thereof. The vent assembly includes an annular 
depression in the seal panel inward relative to the outer or 
top face thereof and surrounding a central vent hole defined  
 
at the upper end of a truncated generally conical stem at a 
height slightly below the outer top face of the seal panel. The vent cover is generally planar and includes an 
integral depending sealing plug selectively snap-locked within 
the vent opening for a sealing thereof. The cover, in the 
closed sealing position thereof, presents an upper surface 
substantially coplanar with the outer face of the

<CLAIMS>
A vented seal (12) for a container (10), said seal comprising a 
panel (14) having an outer face (18) and an inner face (20), a vent hole (30) 

defined through said panel (14) between said outer and inner faces, a portion of 
said panel laterally adjacent said hole being depressed inwardly relative to said 

outer face and defining an outwardly opening recess (26), a reclosable cover (34) 
for said vent hole (30), means (38,40) for releasably retaining said cover (34) in a 

closed position overlaying and closing said hole (30), said cover (34) being 
outwardly releasable from said closed position, said cover (34), in said closed 

position, extending laterally beyond said hole (30) and partially overlaying said 
recess (26), said recess, beyond said cover (34), providing access to said cover 

inward thereof for manual engagement with and outward release of said cover. 
The vented seal of claim 1 wherein said cover (34) includes an 
outer surface which, in said closed position, is in substantially a common plane 

with said outer face (18) of said seal panel (14). 
The vented seal of claim 2 including means (42,44,48) hingedly 
mounting said cover (34) to said seal panel (14) for pivotal movement toward and 

away from said closed position. 
The vented seal of claim 1, wherein said recess (28) is elongate 
and extends peripherally around at least a major portion of said vent hole (30). 
The vented seal of claim 2 or 3 or 4 wherein said recess (26) is 
substantially annular with said hole (30) defined generally centrally thereof and at a 

level inward of said outer face (18) of said seal panel. 
The vented seal of claim 4 wherein said means hingedly 
mounting said cover comprises a hinge bar (42) and a living hinge (44) integrally 

joining said cover (34) to said bar (42), said hinge bar including projecting lug 
means (48), said seal panel including outwardly opening socket means (54,58) 

receiving and releasably snap-locking to said lug means (48). 
The vented seal of claim 6 wherein said socket means (54,58) is 
in said recess (26) in inwardly spaced relation to said seal panel outer face (18), 

said socket means opening outward relative to said recess. 
The vented seal of claim 4 or 5 or 7 wherein said cover (34), in 
said closed position, partially overlays said recess (26) along at least a major 

portion of the length of said recess around said vent hole (30). 
The vented seal of claim 5 including a central hollow stem (28) 
defined from said seal panel (14) by said substantially annular recess (26), said 

stem (28) having an outer end inward of said outer face and defining said vent hole 
(30). 
The vented seal of claim 9 wherein said recess (26) is 
substantially semicircular in cross
-section, and said stem (28) is of a truncated 
substantially conical configuration.
