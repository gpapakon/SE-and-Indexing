<DESCRIPTION>
 ASSAY MODULE TRANSPORT APPARATUS FOR USE IN AN AUTOMATED ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to automated analytical instruments and more particularly to automated analytical instruments for use in conducting assays for components of interest in fluid samples. In recent years, a number of automated instruments have been developed to perform analyses of fluid samples. As is known in the art, such instruments may be used to test various types of biological fluids for substances of interest, for example, to find evidence of disease, to monitor therapeutic drug levels, and the like. Typically, such automated analytical instruments utilize either liquid reagents or dry reagents to assay for a substance of interest. Various different types of assay devices are known for use in such automated instruments including, for example, dry thin-film multilayer assay elements which are typically mounted in an assay module and capillary assay devices. 

 Generally speaking, the testing system portion of automated analytical instruments which use assay modules to test for a component of interest typically include a fluid dispensing system for metering out a quantity of the fluid sample to be analyzed to an assay module, a temperature controlled chamber for holding the assay modules at the appropriate temperature to allow the reaction to take place, an analyzing system for measuring a detectable change brought about by the presence of the substance of interest in the fluid sample and some mechanism for conveying the assay module to each of the foregoing components in the proper order.The assay modules may be provided by various techniques. In one type of automated analytical instrument an assay module to be used is manually loaded into an assay module transfer device. The assay module is then transferred to the test system. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,152,390, there is described an automated analytical instrument which includes, in addition to the testing system, a supply unit for holding a plurality of assay modules and a transfer apparatus for transferring an assay module from the supply unit to the testing system. The assay modules are stacked in containers, which may be received in a nest of the analyzing apparatus with a spring biased plunger arranged to enter the container through an opening. The plunger engages a movable element located in the container behind the stack of modules to urge the top module forwardly towards the testing system portion of the instrument. The
