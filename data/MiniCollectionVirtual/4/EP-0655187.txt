<ABSTRACT>
Broadcaster for distributing fertilisers and the like on agricultural areas, with a supply container and with at least two rotary-driven centrifugal disks which are arranged underneath the supply container and on which at least one throwing element consisting of two parts is arranged, at least the outer part of the throwing element being displaceable to different positions to obtain different lengths of the throwing element, being adjustable in length relative to the inner part of the respective throwing element and being lockable in different positions, and the respective throwing element consisting of an inner and an outer part being designed as a telescopically extendable and retractable throwing element. In order to simplify this setting substantially in a simple way, provision is made for obtaining a first smaller range in the working width for spreading, in the retracted position of the outer part (14, 16), and for obtaining a second larger range of the working width for spreading, in the extended position of the outer part (1).

Centrifugal broadcaster for distributing fertilisers and the like over
agricultural areas, having a hopper and at least two rotatably driven

centrifugal discs disposed beneath the hopper, on which centrifugal discs
at least one throwing element, comprising two parts, is disposed, at least

the outer part of the throwing element being displaceable into various
positions for achieving various lengths of the throwing element, said

outer part being longitudinally adjustable relative to the inner part of the
particular throwing element and being lockable in various positions, and

the particular throwing element, which comprises an inner part and an
outer part, being configured as a telescopically extendable and retractable

throwing element, a first, smaller range of broadcasting width being
achieved in the retracted position of the outer part (14, 16), and a second,

larger range of broadcasting width being achieved in the extended
position of the outer part (1), characterised in that the inner part (13, 15)

and the outer part (14, 16) are displaceable relative to each other in only
two positions.
Centrifugal fertiliser broadcaster according to claim 1,
characterised in that the outer part (14, 16) is configured in such a way

for the extended position that the upwardly extending wall portion of the
outer part lies on the same plane as the upwardly extending wall portion

of the inner part.
Centrifugal fertiliser broadcaster according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that a larger range and a smaller range

of broadcasting width are obtainable by securing the outer part (14, 16)
of the throwing vane (11, 12) in two positions relative to the inner part 

(13, 15) of said vane, in that, for the larger range of broadcasting width,
the outer part (14, 16) of the throwing vanes (11, 12) is respectively

displaceable into such a position that the circumferential speed at the
broadcasting edges (25) of the throwing vanes is substantially between

18 and 37 m/sec, preferably approx. 23 m/sec for the shorter throwing
vane (11) and approx. 30 m/sec for the longer throwing vane (12), and/or

in that, for the smaller broadcasting widths, the circumferential speed at
the broadcasting edges (25) of the throwing vanes (11, 12) is

substantially between 13 and 26 m/sec, preferably approx. 17 m/sec for
the shorter throwing vane (11) and approx. 21 m/sec for the longer

throwing vane (12).
Centrifugal fertiliser broadcaster according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer extendable part (14, 16)

has a lower guide face (17) which can be sec in various positions.
Centrifugal fertiliser broadcaster according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the throwing vanes (11, 12) are

disposed on the broadcasting discs (10) so as to be angularly pivotable in

the disc plane and able to be set at different angles radially.
Centrifugal fertiliser broadcaster according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer extendable part has an

upper guide face which can be set in various positions.
Centrifugal broadcaster according to claim 1, characterised in that,
at least two throwing elements (11, 12) are disposed on each centrifugal

disc (10), and in that the two outer parts (14, 16) of the throwing 
elements (11, 12) are selectively extendable, the one outer part (14, 16)

being usable in the retracted position and the other outer part (14, 16)
being usable in the extended position.
Centrifugal fertiliser broadcaster, more especially according to
claim 1, characterised in that the inner parts of the throwing elements

(13, 15) have an identical configuration.
