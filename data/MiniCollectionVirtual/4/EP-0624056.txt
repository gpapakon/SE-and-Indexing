<ABSTRACT>
A safety system operating as follows: when someone gets too close to the power take-off or the driven machine, a rocker system A actuated by a sensor or an electronic beam immediately and automatically blocks the rotational motion of the cardan drive and separates it from the power take-off. As a result, the machine stops and is no longer driven, the cardan drive falls to the ground and stops moving so that it no longer threatens to cause an accident or injure the user or a careless onlooker.

Safety coupling for power take-off for transmitting 
the movement from the power take-off to the driven 

shaft of a machine, characterized by: 

an element (F, H) integral with the output shaft 
(M) of the safety coupling, 
an intermediate element (E) arranged so that it 
engages with the previous element (F, H) and locks and 

unlocks the power take-off on the one hand and the 
element (F, H) integral with the output shaft (M) on the 

other hand, so as to transmit or to interrupt the movement 
from the power take-off to the output shaft (M), 
an uncoupling control member (A, B) arranged for 
blocking the intermediate element (E) in order to unlock 

the fixture and interrupt the drive. 
Safety coupling according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the element (F, H) integral with the output 

shaft (M) is of tapered shape composed of two components 
(F and H) and provided with studs (G) which are blocked 

in the groove (C) of the power take-off in the case of 
normal running and is provided with round bars (I). 
Safety coupling according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the intermediate element (E) of tapered 

shape is provided with a stop (D) and with slideways (J) 
intended to accommodate the round bars (I) borne by the 

element (F, H) integral with the output shaft (M). 
Safety coupling according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the uncoupling control member includes a 

feeler which remotely controls a pivoting lever (A) of 
the control member which blocks the stop (D) and causes 

the tapered intermediate element (E) to stop and thereafter  
 

unscrew the round bars (I) out of the slideways 
(J), separating the tapered elements into three 

components which are no longer driven by the power take-off. 
Safety coupling according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that it is supported by a ring (B) of the control 

member sliding along the power take-off. 
Safety coupling according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by a first pin (L) integral with the 

tapered intermediate element (E) and a second pin (K) 
integral with one of the components (F, H) of the other 

tapered element (F, H) and by a spring placed between 
these two pins (L, K) so that the components can be 

screwed fully together at the time of assembly and so 
that the round bars (I) remain in the slideways (J) 

during normal running; the spring allows the tapered 
elements (E, F, H) to be unscrewed during the phase in 

which the pivoting lever (A) is actuated. 
Safety coupling according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by a feeler consisting of a means allowing 

the pivoting lever (A) to be actuated remotely. 
Safety coupling according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by a feeler consisting of a proximity 

detector. 
Safety coupling according to Claims 1 to 5 and 7 
to 8, characterized by a feeler whose radius of action 

may range from the rear of the driving machine as far as 
the end of the driven machine. 
Safety coupling according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by an output shaft (M) either in the form 

of a length of shaft, which is splined like the power 
take-off (C), or in the form of a cardan (journal cross).
