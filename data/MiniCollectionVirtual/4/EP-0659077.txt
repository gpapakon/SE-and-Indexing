<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for treating a patient suffering from xerostomia, xerophthalmia or excessive intraocular pressure. The method comprises administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of pilocarpine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in an amount sufficient to maintain a blood serum level of pilocarpine in said patient of from about 5 to about 40 ng/ml, for a period of at least 6 hours. Controlled release unit dosage forms containing pilocarpine are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONTROLLED RELEASE PILOCARPINE DELIVERY SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to xerostomia, commonly known as "dry mouth syndrome", and to xerophthalmia, a dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea. More particularly, the present invention relates to method for alleviating the symptoms of xerostomia or xerophthalmia in an affected patient. Additionally, this invention relates to a method for alleviating excessive intraocular pressure.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNormally an individual produces 0.5 to 1 liter per day of saliva. Although varying greatly between individuals, on average 65 percent of saliva is submandibular, 23 percent from the parotids, 8 percent from the minor mucous, and 4 percent sublingual.Xerostomia is a condition in which the salivary glands do not produce sufficient quantities of saliva. This causes discomfort which can in some cases be quite severe. Without saliva, the mouth burns and the throat and tongue can undergo radical changes. Teeth can decay rapidly and the tongue can become smooth, cracked and vulnerable to infection. There is often a loss of taste and, because saliva contains important digestive enzymes, there are often problems with digestion.The persistence of a dry mouth at night can disturb sleep causing the individual suffering from it to waken frequently, even every hour. Furthermore periodontal disease and increased tooth decay as well as loss of teeth can be a result of xerostomia.The mouth is one of the body areas most exposed to the external environment. Normally, mucous forms a continuous protective layer in the nose, mouth and throat. A patient suffering from xerostomia not only has decreased fluid in 

the mouth, but also an insufficient quantity of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides to hold fluid in contact with the cells and create a barrier to irritation and infection. The onset of the effects of xerostomia is insidious with no clear line of demarcation when one has or has not the malady. Also different individuals may have different symptoms to a differing extent in a different succession. Dry mouth is the most common symptom. Alteration of taste sensation leads to change in the selection and perception of food. After alteration comes taste desensitation, which may lead to lack of any taste.Sores on any of the mucous tissues of the oral area (tongue, gums, mouth, cheeks etc.), ulcerations, fissures, swellings, bleeding, coatings, even erosion of the tongue are all possible. With the decrease in saliva comes incomplete digestion,

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS
1. A method for treating a patient suffering from xerostomia, xerophthalmia, or excessive intraocular pressure, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of pilocarpine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in an amount sufficient to maintain a blood serum level of pilocarpine in said patient of from about 5 to about 40 ng/ml, for a period of at least 6 hours.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the patient is to receive radiotherapy and the pilocarpine is administered in a prophylactically effective amount, prior to the commencement of radiotherapy.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the patient is to receive chemotherapy and the pilocarpine is administered in a prophylactically effective amount, prior to the commencement of chemotherapy.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the xerostomia or xerophthalmia is chemically induced xerostomia or xerophthalmia.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the xerostomia or xerophthalmia is age related xerostomia or xerophthalmia.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the xerostomia or xerophthalmia is seasonal induced xerostomia or xerophthalmia. 


 7. A formulation in unit dosage form comprising an intimate admixture of pilocarpine and calcium polycarbophil, wherein from about 5 to about 30 mg of pilocarpine is present and the ratio of calcium polycarbophil to pilocarpine is from about 10:1 to about 20:1.
8. The dosage form of claim 7 wherein from about 0.1 to about 30 percent, by weight, of carbomer polymer is present.
9. The dosage form of claim 7 wherein from about 0.1 to about 30 percent, by weight, of hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy propylmethyl cellulose, or a mixture thereof is present.
10. The dosage form of claim 9 wherein from about 0.1 to about 30 percent, by weight, of carbomer polymer is present.
