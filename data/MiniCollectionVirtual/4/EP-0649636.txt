<ABSTRACT>
A multistrand surgical cerclage cable having a multistrand fixation 
portion (10) and a multistrand leader (11) is disclosed. 

The cable is very 
flexible and the leader (11) is more malleable and stiffer than 

the fixation portion (10) allowing the leader (11) to be shaped to be 
fed or 

directed around and between tissue in the patients body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical cables, 
particularly cerclage cables that are used in surgical 
procedures to stabilize fractures and to secure various 
types of prosthesis to bones. Cerclage fixation by wires, sutures and cables has been 
used for some time to repair fractured bones and to secure 
prosthetic devices to bones, particularly in the spine. 
Originally, surgical fixation was achieved by stiff 
stainless steel wires which could be molded into shape and 
passed around or between various bones and then twisted 
together to tighten the wire around the bone or around the 
prosthesis. The use of surgical cable or wire devices of 
this type for this purpose is disclosed in the following 
Stephens, et.al. 4,604,995; Dove, et.al. 4,790,303; 
Steffee, 4,686,970 and Mehaland 5,092,868. The wire used to repair fractured bones or to secure the 
prosthesis to bone have generally been monofilament 
stainless steel or titanium. These materials had 
sufficient malleability to enable the physician or 
operating room personnel to shape the wire into the 
desired configuration to pass the wire between or around 
bones. An example of this technique is shown in the above 
mentioned U.S. Patent 5,092,868. The problem with wires of this type is that they were 
extremely hard and stiff, and for that reason great care 
had to be exercised in the operating room in moving the 
wire around bones since it could cause serious or  
 
irreparable damage to the underlying soft tissue if the 
tissue was inadvertently contacted with excessive force. 
This is particularly true in the spinal column in 
procedures in which a prosthesis or a bone graft is 
affixed to the vertebrae to stabilize the vertebrae. More recently, there has become available a relatively 
soft and flexible cable, 
see e.g. JP-A-02 211 164, 
which avoids the problem of the 
stiff wires previously used. These new soft flexible 
cables have comparable strength to the stiff cables 
previously used. They are made with multiple wire 
filaments fully work hardened and twisted together to form 
a strand and then a plurality of these strands are twisted 
together around a core strand to make a strong flexible 
cable. These cables are a marked improvement over the 
wire which have previously been used. However, because of 
the flexibility and relatively little ductility they are 
difficult to form and pass around bone segments in the 
vertebrae or around bones that are not readily accessible. The present invention provides a highly flexible cable 
with a
