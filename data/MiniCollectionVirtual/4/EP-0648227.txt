<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a glycoprotein obtainable from grey matter, e.g. from mammalian sources, and capable of inducing growth cone collapse. The glycoprotein is implicated in neurodegeneration and so can be used as the basis of attempts to stimulate nerve regeneration by interfering with the functioning of the glycoprotein, e.g. by use of antibodies thereto. The invention thus also provides a method of inhibiting neurodegeneration or promoting neuroregeneration comprising administering to a patient a substance that interferes (up or down regulates) with the functioning of glycoprotein of the invention. The invention finds applicability in the treatment of conditions and diseases such as acute brain injury, Alzheimer's Disease or motor neurone disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: Improvements in or relating to NeuroregenerationThis invention relates to neuroregeneration.Background to the InventionVarious mammalian diseases are known which involve progressive chronic degeneration of central nervous system (CNS) and/or peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons. Examples of such diseases that have been closely studied in humans include Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease and various motor neurone diseases.In Alzheimer's Disease, lesions occur in cerebral cortex neurons, in particular cholinergic neurons projecting from the substantia innominata to the cortex. Treatment regimes are aimed at enhancing the activity of the remaining neurons.Motor neurone disease, in which there is a chronic degeneration of CNS and PNS motor neurons resulting in a loss of muscle strength and control, can be treated in similar ways.Acute conditions involving brain injury include the following:1 ) acute mechanical trauma with axotomy (for example, 

penetrating brain injury and spinal cord transection);2) cerebrovascular accident due to haemorrhage, thrombosis or embolism;3 ) brain and spinal cord damage due to bacterial or viral infection, and tumour or abscess expansion.A disadvantage common to the known treatments of the diseases and conditions outlined above is that the treatment is aimed at enhancing the activity of remaining neurons rather than in replacing lost neurons or halting the degeneration that causes the disease. As a result, higher doses of relevant drugs are required as the disease progresses. Further, it is likely that in time the disease goes beyond the point at which treatment can be effective.A further disadvantage is that there are side effects associated with the drugs used for treating the diseases.The present invention aims to mitigate at least some of these disadvantages.Davies et al, 1990 describes the isolation from the posterior half of chick embryo somites of a glycoprotein fraction that causes growth cone collapse of chick sensory neurons. The glycoproteins bind to the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and were shown by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions to have two major components with apparent molecular weights of 48K and 55K.The present invention is based on the extraction from grey matter of one or more glycoproteins that have been 

implicated in neurodegeneration.Summary of the InventionIn one aspect the present invention provides glycoprotein obtainable from grey matter, and capable of inducing growth cone collapse.It is not at present clear whether there are
