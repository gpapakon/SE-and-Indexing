<ABSTRACT>
A surgical method for removing cataracts from the eye by disrupting them but minimizing the danger of piercing neighboring tissue through the use of a phaco-shield (30). The phaco-shield has two flexible flaps (23) which are guided by a Y-shaped wire guide (26) to surround the nucleus of the lens (11). A disrupting probe (40) is inserted through a central opening (24) in the base (22) of the phaco-shield to break up the cataract nucleus (16). The flaps are of a length to cover the end of the probe prior to the probe's contact with the posterior capsule (21) in order to prevent damage to the capsule.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cataract surgery and, more
particularly, to the process of surgically removing the
"diseased" lens or cataract more safely than heretofore.
Specifically, the present invention relates to a specially
designed shield for performing the emulsification of the
diseased lens (phaco-emulsification) and removing the
"emulsion" in a safe, effective manner.As shown in Figure 1 (the drawing showing the various
parts of the eye), the lens 11 is perhaps the most critical
element within the eye in providing vision for the human or
animal. It is suspended behind the cornea 12, the anterior
chamber 13 and the iris 14 by the zonular fibre's which
connect it with the ciliary body of muscles 15 around its
periphery.The lens is composed of a central region, the nucleus
16, surrounded by a softer outer region, the cortex 17. It
is encapsulated in the lens capsule 18, which is a thin
transparent membrane. The front part of the membrane is 
called the anterior capsule 20, and the rear part, the
posterior capsule 21. The function of the lens is to focus light rays upon the
sensitive retina 19. To focus light from a distant object,
the ciliary muscles 15 relax, thus tightening the zonular
fibers and reducing the thickness of the lens to its minimal
dimension. To focus light from a near object, the ciliary
muscles 15 release the tension on the zonular fibers to
increase the thickness of the lens, the lens assuming a near
spherical shape. This change increases the lens refractive
power to again obtain focusing of the light rays on the
retina 19.The lens consists of about 35% protein and 65% water.
When the proteinaceous material hardens or becomes suffused
with minerals, the lens becomes cloudy or opaque. A cloudy
lens or an opaque, non-functional lens is a cataract. Most
cataracts are not visible to the casual observer until they
become dense enough to cause blindness.Cataract surgery involves the removal of the "diseased"
lens from the eye. Two principal procedures for lens
extractions are practiced currently. Intracapsular surgery
involves removal of the lens together with its surrounding
capsule. Where the posterior capsule may be attached
slightly to the vitreous membrane, extracapsular extraction 
of the lens is much preferred. Rupturing the vitreous
membrane, a definite hazard in intracapsular surgery, has
serious consequences, including vitreous loss, vitreous
haemorrhage, retina detachment etc.This invention relates to extracapsular extraction, the
procedure considered the safest. However, even

<CLAIMS>
A phaco-shield (30) for placement over an eye, the eye
having a cornea (12), an anterior capsule (20), a nucleus

(16) and a posterior capsule (21), the phaco shield (30)
comprising


a base (22) being so sized and configured that in use
the base (22) is able to fit over the surface of the cornea

(12), the base (22) having
a central opening (24) being adapted to receive
therethrough a probe (40) having a sharp leading edge that,

in use, enables penetration of the anterior capsule (20)
and disruption of the nucleus (16) of the eye characterised

in that
the base (22) is sufficiently flexible that in use it
is able to conform to the surface of the cornea (12),

and
the phaco-shield (30) comprises at least one flap (23)
extending longitudinally and directly from the base (22) on

at least one side of the opening (24) and being so sized
and configured and sufficiently rigid that, in use, said at

least one flap (23) is able to be passed through the
anterior capsule (20) and sufficiently flexible that, in

use, said at least one flap (23) is able to be deformed
upon contact with the posterior capsule (21) to cover the

sharp leading edge of
a probe (40) received through the central opening (24)

thereby preventing
contact between the sharp leading edge and the posterior

capsule (21) of the eye.
A phaco-shield (30) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
phaco-shield (30) comprises two flaps (23) extending

longitudinally and directly from the base (22), one on one
side of the opening (24) and the other on the opposite side

of the opening (24).
A phaco-shield (30) as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein the base is substantially flat.
A kit of parts for use in a method of surgically
removing a cataract from an eye, the kit comprising


a phaco-shield (30) as claimed in any of the preceding
claims and
a phaco-shield guide (26) comprising a handle (25), a
body and split ends (27) integral with the body, the split

ends (27) adapted to separate when forced over a relatively
solid object and the body of the guide (26) is rotated

about its longitudinal axis.
