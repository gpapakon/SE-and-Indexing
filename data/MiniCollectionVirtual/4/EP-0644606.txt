<ABSTRACT>
A portable radio communication device has an 
antenna (1) which can be extended for use and retracted for 

storage, and can transmit a signal at the same level of 
electric energy when the antenna is stored as when the 

antenna is extended. When the antenna (1) is retracted and 
stored, the stored condition is detected by a detecting 

switch (2). In response to a detected signal from the 
detecting switch, a transmission output controller (5) 

produces an increased transmission output control signal to 
increase the level of electric energy of the signal to be 

transmitted which is higher than a normal level of electric 
energy of signals transmitted from the antenna. When the 

increased transmission output control signal is generated, a 
power amplifier (3) amplifies a signal to be transmitted 

which is supplied from a transmission signal generator (4), 
and supplies the amplified signal to the antenna. Therefore, 

even when the antenna is stored, it can radiate the signal at 
the same level of electric energy as when the antenna is 

extended. The antenna comprises an antenna which operates as 
a loaded antenna when it is extended and as a helical antenna 

when it is stored.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present inventon relates to a portable radio communication device
having an antenna which can be extended for use and retracted for storage, and more
particularly to a portable radio communication device of the type specified in the
preamble of claim 1.A portable radio communication device of the type referred to
hereinabove is known from GB-A-2 235 588.A radio transceiver including a control section for setting a transmitting
output level higher or lower than a prescribed output level within a tolerance range, in
response to a signal from a level conversion circuit, is known from EP-A-0 392 079.
In said transceiver, the level conversion circuit may designate a lower transmission
output level to reduce power consumption, and may designate a higher transmitting
output level in the presence of high noise levels, without providing dependence of
such designation on a current condition of a multi-condition antenna.Generally, recent years have seen widespread use of portable radio
communication 
devices such as portable telephone sets. Such portable radio communication devices
are required to be small in size and light in weight, and have antennas that are extended
when in use and stored when not in use.On small-size portable radio communication devices, the antenna is
positioned closely to those components, including the housing of the device and the
printed-circuit board in the housing, which affect the characteristics of the antenna.
When the antenna is stored, it is positioned in the housing closely to the printed-circuit
board, resulting in a reduced antenna gain. During storage of the antenna, the
gain of the antenna is also lowered because the effective length of the antenna is
smaller.To meet the requirements for small sizes and low weights, there have 
been demands for portable telephone sets, cordless telephone sets, and low-power
radio communication devices which have smaller and lighter circuit components and
batteries, and smaller and higher-performance antennas.Generally, portable radio communication devices are designed to radiate
a predetermined amount of electric energy while the antenna is being extended.The user of a portable telephone set extends its antenna before making an
outgoing call through the portable telephone set. However, when an incoming call
from another party arrives, the antenna has usually been stored in the housing of the
portable telephone set. Upon arrival of the call, the user extends the antenna for use.More specifically, when a portable telephone set receives an
