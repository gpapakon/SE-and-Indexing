<ABSTRACT>
Rotating stirring device, particularly for mixing heterogeneous 
systems in mechanical stirred reactors, fit to be joined 

to a drive shaft coaxial with respect to the device rotation 
axis, which comprises a plurality of extended and substantially 

C-shaped stirring elements, symmeterically arranged 
with respect to the rotation axis and joined each other at the 

respective ends correspondently with the rotation axis. Such 
a device permits to obtain a very efficient material exchange 

among different phases, substantially remaining constant with 
the increase of the volume of the mass put under stirring, 

and it is also characterized by high mixing homogeneity and 
particularly low shear stress values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylinder-shaped reactor 
comprising a rotating stirring 
apparatus, particularly for mixing heterogeneous systems. Various kinds of mechanical stirred reactors are known in 
the art, generally of cylindric shape, in which processes are 
carried out where a continuous and uniform mixing of various 
components and an efficient mass exchange between different 
phases (for instance, gas-liquid, gas-liquid-solid, liquid-solid, 
liquid-liquid, etc.) are required. The mechanical 
stirring is commonly carried out through a stirrer put inside 
the reactor in axial position. The particular stirrer shape 
(turbine, blade, propeller, etc.) is mainly chosen according 
to the viscosity of the mass to be put under stirring (to this 
purpose see "Advances in Chemical Engineering", vol. 17, pag. 
5-8, Academic Press, 1992). A common limit to all the stirring devices of the art is 
represented, in the case of gas-liquid systems, by a generally 
not high mass transfer coefficient between the phases and 
which considerably decreases when an increase with time of the 
volume of the mass put under stirring occurs. This is the 
case, for instance, of polymerization reactions in emulsion or  
 
in suspension in which at least one of the monomers is present 
in the gas phase: during the polymerization a gradual increase 
of the volume and of the solid content of the liquid phase 
occurs. A lowering of the mass transfer between the gas phase 
and liquid phase and consequently a reduction of the process 
yield derives therefrom. The difficulty to obtain satisfactory mass exchanges 
between the various phases imposes moreover some limits in the 
reactor shape. In particular, with the traditional stirring 
systems the use of reactors with a high height/diameter ratio, 
which would assure a more efficient thermal exchange, is in 
fact impossible. In the gas-liquid systems, in order to improve the mass 
exchange between the phases, the use of devices distributing 
the gas inside the liquid phase (spargers) is known. They are 
in practice toroidal shaped devices, endowed with holes, through 
which the gas is bubbled. Such devices require however a 
very frequent maintenance, as they tend to be easily clogged, 
especially in the case in which in the liquid phase a solid 
phase is present or is formed during the reaction (it is the 
case, for instance, of the polymerization reactions). The Applicant has now found a new type of rotating stirring 
device as described hereinunder, particularly suited 
for
