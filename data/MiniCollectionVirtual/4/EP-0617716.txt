<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain flame retardant polyamides and
more particularly to such polyamides where the polyamides are copolymers
of polyamide 6.6.The use of melamine and melamine derivatives such as melamine
cyanurate as flame retardant agents for polyamides has been known for
many years (U.S. Patent 3,660,344 and U.S. Patent Re 30,402). In the case
of polyamide 6.6, which is specifically used for its better thermal aging
properties, versus polyamide 6, this has not been achieved with melamine
because its volatility creates a large amount of melamine white mold
deposition. Additionally, blooming of melamine from molded pieces under
various simulated use conditions has been noted previously (U.S. Patent
4,525,505) as a reason why this art has not been practiced commercially.
The volatility of melamine and its tendency to sublime at typical polyamide
6.6 molding temperatures (270°C-290°C) has generally rendered melamine-containing
polyamide 6.6 compositions unattractive from a commercial point
of view. The alternative to melamine has been the use of melamine
derivatives or its condensation products such as melamine cyanurate; but,
although these have presented solutions to the melamine blooming issues,
they have proved difficult to scale-up to typical commercial processes
without some loss of flammability control.The object of the invention is to provide unreinforced flame
retardant polyamide molding compositions which have melamine as the
flame retardant and which consistently meet the UL94 V-O criteria at all the
specified thicknesses according to standards described for commercial
acceptability based on statistical representation whilst at the same time
minimizing any blooming of melamine during the molding process without
reducing the thermal resistance properties of the polyamides.EP-0,461,097 provides a flame retardant polyamide
molding resin made by adding a glycol and a phthalate ester to
a process wherein a polyamide is melt-blended with melamine
and cyanuric acid in presence of water. EP-0,241,702 describes polyamide compositions which
are reinforced with unsized glas fibers and which have been
made flame retardant by adding melamine or melamine cyanurate.
The polyamide is preferably polyamide 6 or 6.6.The present invention provides a flame retardant
polyamide composition consisting essentially of:
(a) a modified polyamide 6.6 having a
melting point below 250°C obtained by
copolymerizing hexamethylene diamine and adipic
acid with at least one other monomer
copolymerizable therewith,
