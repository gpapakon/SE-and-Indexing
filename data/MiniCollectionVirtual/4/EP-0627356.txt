<ABSTRACT>
A socket end closure arrangement comprises a socket 4 in an 
article 5 and a closure 1 for the socket end. The closure 1 

comprises a plug 2 for fitting into the socket 4, and to 
which plug 2 is attached, preferably tangentially, a disc-like 

flange 3. The plug 2 has spherically arranged surfaces 
having a curvature substantially derived from the surface of 

a sphere and permitting selection of the orientation of the 
plug in fitting of the plug 2, preferably in interference 

fit manner, into the socket 4 from a plurality of 
alternative orientations about at least one axis transverse 

to the longitudinal axis y of the socket 4. The flange 3 
preferably locates into a surface recess 7 to become flush 

with the surface of the article 5. The plug may be 
physically structured in prov
iding resilience and 
accordingly may be segmented 24. The axis y may be non-perpendicular 

to the plane of, or tangent to, the article 
surface and the axis x of the recess 7 may not be aligned 

with axis y. In a second aspect, the invention provides a 
socket end closure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a closure arrangement for a socket
end and particularly but not exclusively for a tubular
socket providing a recessed fixing hole in an article,
particularly a moulded article. The invention also relates
to a closure for a socket end.It has long been the tradition to conceal fixings such as
screws in articles assembled together by providing a recess
for the screw head and then closing off the recess above the
screw head. In cases where the recess has comprised a
tubular socket, this has been achieved with a piece of
wooden dowelling or with a plastics closure.Because of the greater convenience provided by plastics
closures, these have been generally favoured where they are
aesthetically acceptable. This is particularly so in the
case of moulded plastics articles where colour-matching of
a closure with the moulded article can be readily achieved
by the moulder.Traditionally, such plastics closures have had a cap-like
profile providing a short spigot for insertion into the
recess or socket above the screw head for example, and a
substantially flat or domed top to sit proud of the surface
of the article. Such plastics closures still detract from a
pleasing appearance being presented by the fixed article.FR-A- 901 562 discloses a hollow stopper made of a resilient
material and which has a part-spherical body and a flange.
The body fits inside the neck of a container to provide a
seal for the container, and the flange enables the stopper
to be removed without damage to the stopper.In the environment of the interior of motor vehicles, the
avoidance of unnecessary surface roughness is desirable from
a safety, as well as aesthetic, point of view. However, if
removal of the closure is a requirement in order to gain
access to the fixing for the purpose of removing the
article, then a closure having a top which fits the recess
would present difficulty in gaining its efficient removal.
Still further, in the environment of the interior of a motor 
vehicle it is important that such closures are not easily
displaced from the recesses by vibration or by simply being
dragged out by the passage of clothing, for example, passing
over them.While the provision of deeply recessed fixing holes, for
example fixing holes at the bottoms of sockets, permit the
use of closures having a longer spigot to assist their
retention, these present the problem that for sockets having
an axis non-perpendicular to the plane of the surrounding
surface of the article or to a tangent drawn at a point
where the axis

<CLAIMS>
A socket closure arrangement comprising a socket (4) in
an article and a socket end closure (1) for the end of the

socket, which closure comprises a plug (2) for fitting into
the socket from an open end and having attached thereto a

disc-like flange (3) for closing off said end, wherein the
plug has spherically arranged surfaces having a curvature

substantially derived from the surface of a sphere for
contacting the inner wall of the socket in fitting the plug

into the socket and permitting selection of the orientation
of the plug in the fitting of the plug into the socket from

a plurality of alternative orientations about at least one
axis transverse to the axis (y) of the socket characterised

in that a surface recess (7) is provided at least partly

around the open end of the socket (4) into which the flange
(3) is adapted to locate.
A socket closure arrangement as claimed in Claim 1
wherein the plurality of alternative orientations are about

at least two axes perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (y)
of the socket (4).
A socket closure arrangement as claimed in Claim 2
wherein the alternative orientations are about all axes

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (y) of the socket
(4).
A socket closure arrangement as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 3 wherein the fitting of the plug (2) into the

socket (4) is in interference fit manner.
A socket closure arrangement as claimed in any one of
Claims 1 to 4 wherein the longitudinal axis (y) of the

socket (4) is non-perpendicular to the plane of a surface 
(5) surrounding the socket or to a tangent drawn at a point
