<ABSTRACT>
A sonic generator comprises a resonant bar (11), a 
housing (20) and magnetic excitation (13) units connected between the 

resonant bar (11) and the housing (20). The magnetic excitation 
units (13) 

are connected to the bar (11) at highly stressed points using a 
mounting connection (14) which is a sleeve having an inside 

diameter slightly greater than the outside diameter of the 
bar (11). A resilient elastomer (21) such as urethane is mounted 

between the sleeve (14) and the resonant member (11). The sonic 
generator may be used for grinding purposes and, in 

particular, may be used to grind material exceptionally fine 
with reduced power consumption. The bar (11) is substantially 

unrestrained so as to allow substantially free vibration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for grinding material 
employing a sonic generator used 
for the transmission of energy into fluid mediums and, more 
particularly, to a sonic generator in which the resonant 
member is substantially unrestrained when vibrating. Sonic generators used to convert electrical energy 
into acoustic and kinetic energy for transmission to fluid 
mediums are known. Such devices are illustrated, for 
example, in U.K. Patent Specification 2,152,728 to Bodine 
and U.S. Patent 2,468,515 to Robinson. The sonic generators there disclosed, however, 
suffer disadvantages. For example, the apparatus taught by 
Bodine in the aforementioned U. K. patent utilizes resonant 
drives similar to the types described in Bodine's U.S. 
Patents 3,633,877, 3,684,037, 3,360,056 and 4,265,129. Such 
drives limit the upper range of frequencies such units can 
transmit to a fluid medium. Since the transmission of 
acoustic power between the resonant bar and the fluid is 
less efficient at lower frequencies, the frequency 
limitation lowers the acoustic efficiency of the Bodine 
apparatuses. Bodine also necessarily utilizes a coupling 
between his orbiting mass oscillators and his resonant bar 
which attempts to isolate the inertial forces of the 
vibrating bar from the oscillators. Without such a 
coupling, the magnitude of the forces generated are 
sufficient to cause relatively rapid failure of the orbiting 
mass oscillator drive motors, be they hydraulic or electric.  
 The above-identified Robinson reference teaches 
restraining a resonating bar with steel bushings at 
respectively oppositely located end portions of the bar. 
such supports cause energy to be lost through the steel 
bushing support structure which energy would be better 
utilized in the fluid medium. This is so since Robinson's 
method does not allow for free and unrestrained vibration of 
the resonant member. Rather the resonant member is forced 
to assume a specific mode shape by the steel retaining 
bushings. Robinson's structure also imposes a very high 
stress concentration on the resonant member both at the 
support point and at the point of maximum bending stress. 
Such stress concentration can eventually cause unnecessary 
damage to the resonant member and/or premature failure. It 
also limits the mechanical stresses that can be sustained by 
the member without failure. Existing vibratory grinders generally consist of a 
rigid housing containing the grinding media such as steel 
balls mounted on a spring system
