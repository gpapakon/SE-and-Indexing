<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organo-aluminoxy products. The 
term "organo-aluminoxy" as used herein refers to organic compounds having a 
multiplicity of groups having the functionality 
wherein R is a hydrocarbyl radical. In another aspect, the present 
invention relates to a non-aqueous method for producing aluminoxanes. In 
still another aspect, the present invention relates to olefin 
polymerisation catalysts prepared using the inventive organo-aluminoxy 
materials as a cocatalyst. In still another aspect, the present invention 
relates to a process for polymerizing olefins using such catalyst 
compositions. Organic aluminoxanes are one form of aluminoxy composition which 
has been found suitable for use in catalyst systems for polymerizing 
olefins. The most common techniques employed commercially for producing 
aluminoxanes, are believed to involve adding water in predetermined amounts 
and under controlled conditions to an alkyl aluminum compound. The  
 
reaction of water with alkyl aluminums is often a violent reaction and 
therefore strict process control conditions are generally required when 
using such a method. European Published Patent Application No. 348,126 discloses a 
method for producing hydrocarbyl aluminoxanes by reacting a hydrocarbyl 
aluminum compound with a trihydrocarbyl boroxine. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided still 
another method for preparing aluminoxanes suitable for use as cocatalysts 
in the polymerization of olefins. In accordance with still another aspect 
of the present invention, there is provided new aluminoxy products. In accordance with still yet another object of the present 
invention, there is provided catalyst systems comprising the aluminoxy 
composition and a polymerization catalyst. In yet still another aspect of the invention, there is provided a 
process for the polymerization of olefins. In accordance with the present invention organic aluminoxy 
compounds are prepared by reacting a trihydrocarbyl aluminum compound with 
an organic boron compound having boron acid functionality. Also in 
accordance with the present invention polymerisation catalyst systems are 
prepared using the inventive organic aluminoxy compounds. In accordance with the present invention the inventive 
organo-aluminoxy compounds are produced by reacting a trihydrocarbyl 
aluminum compound with an organic boron compound having boron acid 
functionality under suitable reaction conditions.  It is contemplated that a wide range of trihydrocarbyl aluminum
