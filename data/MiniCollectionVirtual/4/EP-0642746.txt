<ABSTRACT>
To improve quality control a cigarette filter manufacturing line 
is provided with a testing station (28) which periodically removes a 

filter to test the diameter (at 34) and resistance to draw (at 33). 
The mean diameter and RTD of a number of filters is calculated (at 

36) and compared to acceptable ranges. Adjustments are made to the 
manufacturing line to correct any unacceptable values according to a 

set of priorities dependent on the degree and sense of the 
inaccuracies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for measuring the 
resistance to draw of a cigarette filter. One known quality control system for cigarette filter 
manufacture is sold under the trade mark QUARTET by Filtrona 
Instruments and Automation Limited. This system provides an 
automated statistical analysis of current quality trends which 
enables a machine operator to take whatever corrective action is 
deemed necessary. The system operates by picking up filters from 
the production line, measuring a number of filter parameters for 
each filter, displaying the measured parameters and developing a 
statistical analysis of the filter parameters. The system has a 
disadvantage in that it leaves the corrective action necessary to 
the machine controller to determine and implement. This is both 
slow and prone to inaccuracies. One parameter it is desirable to measure is the resistance to 
draw. Apparatus for measuring resistance to draw (RTD) is 
known from EP-A-007 836 and from FR-A-2493 683. The present invention aims to provide an improved 
apparatus for measuring resistance to draw.  
 According to the invention there is provided apparatus for 
measuring the resistance to draw of a cigarette filter, 
characterised by a gauging head having a gas inlet and a gas 
outlet, receiving means arranged within the gauging head for 
receiving a filter and having corresponding apertures for inlet 
and outlet of gas allowing passage of gas across a filter inserted 
in the receiving means, a base portion having a port communicating 
with the receiving means for the passage of gas to assist the 
ejection of filters from the receiving means, and means for 
inverting the gauging head and receiving means for filter 
ejection. Preferably, a further gas port is provided in the base 
portion for admittance of a gas jet to position correctly the 
filter in the filter receiving means. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described 
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a sketch of the process for manufacture of 
cigarette filters; Figure 2 is a block diagram of a control apparatus for 
control of the production of cigarette filters; Figures 3 and 4 show a filter pick-up device for use in the 
apparatus of Figure 2; Figures 5 and 6 show, schematically, an RTD gauging head 
embodying the invention; and Figure 7 is an exploded view of the gauging head of Figures 
5 and 6. Referring to Figure 1, tow is drawn from a bale 1 through 
banding jets 2 and pre-tension rollers 3 by drawing rollers
