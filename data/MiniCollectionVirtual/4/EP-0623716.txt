<ABSTRACT>
The scaffolding comprises standards (1) to which 
respective ledger or tie tubes (5) and diagonal braces 

(5') are attached to form a removable three-dimensional 
truss. The ledger tubes (5) and the braces (5') are 

attached to the standards (1) by means of a fastening at 
bores (3) and (4) in discs (2) fixed at regular intervals 

on the actual standards (1), which fastening takes place 
by hooks (7) belonging in parts (6) attached at the ends 

of such elements (5) and 5'), fastening being assisted by 
wedge keys (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a multidirectional 
scaffolding forming a truss made of standards to which 
ledger and tie tubes and diagonal braces are attached, to 
yield a three-dimensional metallic truss that is 
particular in that all its elements are removable and the 
attachments at the ends of both the ledger and the tie 
tubes and of the diagonal braces are fitted with 
fastening means. The Spanisch Patent of Invention SP-A-8903094 
claims a node for reticular structures, mainly designed 
to form scaffolding, based upon the use of upright 
standards or posts upon which ledger and tie tubes meet 
at various heights, together with stiffening braces laid 
obliquely or diagonally. Each upright standard in the 
truss or scaffolding obtained on the basis of the node 
claimed in such patent of invention, is fitted with a 
number of fixed rings in regular and suitable 
distribution, the rings being shaped as a diabolo, which 
defines a double annular pan facing opposite directions, 
suitable for receiving the clamping effect of the 
respective couplings provided to such end on the ledger 
and tie tubes, a part of the coupling being fixed and the 
other mobile in order for a wedge to be used for 
tightening during assembly. Though the node having the aforesaid features fully  
 
effectively and pleasingly solved the problems inherent 
in conventional scaffolding, its drawback was that its 
cost was higher than what was desirable. Patent FR-2 527 711, has standards provided with 
rings having holes, which holes are regularly 
distributed in the ring for the braces hook that form 
part of the scaffolding, and all of them being placed at 
the same distance of the standard shaft, the possibility 
of longitudinal variation between the standards or the 
braces not been possible. The scaffolding subject hereof, based upon a 
scaffolding comprising standards to which ledger and tie 
tubes and braces are joined to form a three-dimensional 
metallic truss, is particular in that the means of 
attachment of the ends of the ledger and tie tubes and 
indeed the braces use a simple catch comprising a sort of 
hook working with a wedge key, whereas the diabolo shaped 
rings referred to in the above paragraph are replaced by 
simple discs attached at regular intervals to the 
respective standards, which discs can indeed have a 
geometry other than a circle, although tending to have a 
round contour, being fitted with a number of bores that 
tend to be shaped as a trapezium, progressively narrowing 
towards the centre, being

<CLAIMS>
A multidirectional scaffolding of the kind 
constituting a removable three-dimensional metallic 

truss 

comprising standards (1) to which a number of ledger or 
tie tubes (5) or stiffening braces (5') are remov
ably 
attached, the latter obliquely and diagonally, 
each standard being integrally fitted with a number of 
dis-shaped bodies (2) having first bores (3) for the 

fastening of hooks (7) belonging to attachment parts (6) 
provided at the ends of the ledger or tie tubes (5) or 

stiffening braces (5'), said first bores being open 
towards the inside of the respective disc-shaped body 

(2) and closed by the side surface of the standard (1) 
to which said disc-shaped body (2) is attached, 
 
whereby
 
wedges (8) are used for the locking of the attachment 

parts (6), said wedges passing through slots (9) 
provided at the end of each attachment part (6), in 

which end the fastening hooks (7) is formed,
 
characterised in that
 
the disc-shaped bodies are provided with second bores 

(4) arranged in staggered order with the first bores 
(3), said first (3) and second (4) bores being at 

different distances from the centre of the standard.  
 
An improved multidirectional scaffolding, 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the parts (6) 

in which the fastening hooks are conformed are integrally 
attached to the ends of the respective ledger and tie 

tubes (5) whereas the same parts (6) are linked to the 
diagonal braces (5') through bolts (12) that form a part 

of a bracket (11) integrally attached to the actual part 
(6), and arranged in inclination to the latter.
