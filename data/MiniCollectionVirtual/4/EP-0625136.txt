<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGHER ALDEHYDE SEPARATION PROCESSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the separation of higher primary aldehydes from solutions, particularly from solutions containing the mixed aldehyde products of hydrofor ylation processes.DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTAldehydes that contain at least seven carbon atoms and that are free of alpha substituents (hereinafter referred to as "higher primary aldehydes") are useful in the production of flavors, fragrances, lubricants *and pharmaceuticals. When so used, it is often desirable, or even essential, that the aldehydes be relatively free from other materials.It is known that hydroformylation processes are useful in producing aldehydes from alpha olefinÎµ, carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., a rhodium-ligand complex). Generally, such processes produce a mixture of normal aldehydes (normal aldehydes are linear primary aldehydes) and "iso" aldehydes (in the hydroformylation field, aldehydes having an alpha methyl substituent are called iso aldehydes). The mole ratio of the normal and iso aldehydes in such mixtures (usually called the N/I ratio) is often not the optimum ratio for the end use envisioned for the aldehydes. Accordingly, some means must be employed to separate the aldehydes.When mixtures of lower normal and iso aldehydes are produced by hydroformylation processes, the normal aldehyde is fairly readily separated from 

 the iso aldehyde by distillation. However, when mixtures of higher normal and iso aldehydes are produced, separation of mixtures of such aldehydes by distillation is not practicable due to the fact that the boiling points of the higher aldehydes are close to each other and are elevated. In addition, at such elevated temperatures,undesirable reactions (e.g., condensation of the aldehydes to produce "heavies") tend to occur to an increased extent. Hence a variety of other methods have proposed to effect the separation of mixtures of higher normal and iso aldehydes produced by hydroformylation processes.U.S. Patent 4,041,081 discloses that mixtures of higher aldehydes produced by a hydroformylation process can be separated by selectively precipitating the normal aldehyde using, as a precipitating agent, an alkali metal hydrogen sulfite in aqueous solution which forms an insoluble addition product with the normal aldehyde. The addition product is separated by filtration and the higher normal aldehyde is regenerated by reacting the addition product with a carbonyl compound containing from one to four carbon

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A process for separating an aldehyde that contains at least seven carbon atoms and that is free of alpha substituents from a solution containing the aldehyde and a non-polar organic liquid which process comprises contacting the solution with water under conditions such that a solid hydrate of the aldehyde forms and separating the solid hydrate from the solution.
2. A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the solution is the crude reaction product of a hydroformylation process and contains an aldehyde as defined in claim 1 (first aldehyde) and an aldehyde (second aldehyde) that is an isomer of the first aldehyde and wherein the second aldehyde remains in the solution after the formation of the solid hydrate of the first aldehyde.
3. A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the solid hydrate that is separated from the solution is then heated to regenerate the aldehyde.
4. A solid hydrate having the formula:

 wherein R is a hydrocarbyl group containing from 5 to 25 carbon atoms inclusive. 


 5. The solid hydrate of normal heptanal.
6. The solid hydrate of normal nonanal.
7. The solid hydrate of normal undecanal.
8. The solid hydrate of normal tridecanal.
9. The solid hydrate of normal pentadecanal.
10. The solid hydrate of normal hydrocinnamic aldehyde.
