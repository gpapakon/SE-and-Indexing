<ABSTRACT>
A gas or oil fired enclosed boiler (1) comprises a base (2), a top (3), a main rear tank (4), a main front tank (5) and a pair of main side tanks (6, 7) which define an enclosure through which flame and hot gases are led from a burner (12) to an exhaust flue (16). The top (3) includes a removable cover for cleaning access. Four baffle assemblies are provided in the boiler. Adjacent transverse baffle plates (30, 31, 32, 33) are longitudinally spaced-apart to define interconnected transverse passageways. Deflectors (50, 51, 52, 54) are welded to each baffle plate (30, 31, 32, 33) and direct flame and hot gases against the water-carrying surface of the boiler. The baffle plate assemblies are removable through the top of the boiler for cleaning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to boilers and especially to an 
enclosed boiler particularly a boiler which is fired by an 
oil or a gas burner. Many different constructions of enclosed boiler are known; see, 
for example, FR-A-2 129 118. There is, however, a need for an improved construction of 
such boilers which are as thermally efficient as possible 
and yet may be easily cleaned. This invention is directed towards providing such an 
improved construction of boiler. According to the invention, there is provided an enclosed 
boiler comprising the features according to the first portion of claim 1.  
 Many different constructions of enclosed boiler are known. 
There is, however, a need for an improved construction of 
such boilers which are as thermally efficient as possible 
and yet may be easily cleaned. This invention is directed towards providing such an 
improved construction of boiler. This invention is characterised in that 
the sidewall means is substantially rectangular in 
transverse cross section and comprises a front portion, 
a rear portion and a pair of side portions extending 
between the front and rear portions, at least portion 
of the sidewall means being arranged for carrying water 
to be heated; in that the enclosure has an accessway through which access is 
gained for cleaning; and in that the heat exchanger means includes: 
at least two generally rectangular transverse 
baffle plate means extending transversely across 
the enclosure; the transverse baffle plate means being spaced-apart 
one above the other to define therebetween 
a transverse flue gas passageway through which hot 
gases are led, each transverse baffle plate means defining an 
opening, adjacent transverse bridging means being longitudinally 
spaced-apart to define therebetween transverse 
passageway means through which hot gases are led; each bridging means defining an opening, the opening in 
one bridging means defining an inlet through which hot 
gases are introduced into the transverse passageway 
means and the opening in a following bridging means 
defining an outlet through which the hot gases are led 
from the passageway means; and deflecting means within the transverse passageway for
