<ABSTRACT>
In order to construct an insulating material in board (10) or web form for new structures and structures to be renovated for placing on bearing walls (11), consisting of a multi-layer construction board with a generally rectangular body or of a web of polyurethane foam, polystyrene particle foam, extruded polystyrene or mineral fibre as a heat insulating material (15), in which the heat insulating material (15) has a covering material on at least one of its large sides, in such a way that the heat insulation and the necessary bonding layer can be applied to the bearing walls in one operation so that the walls are ready to take the facing, it is proposed that, as a covering material, a bearing layer (16) for wall or insulating material cover materials (14) be applied to the heat insulating material (15) as a facing material.

<CLAIMS>
An insulating material as a board (10) or as a continuous 
roll for putting on a bearing walling (11) of 

new buildings and those which need to be renovated, 
which insulating material, being a multilayered building 

board comprising an approximately rectangular board 
body or a continuous roll, uses polyurethane foam, polystyrene 

particle foam, extruded polystyrene or mineral 
fiber as heat insulating material (15),said heat 

insulating material (15) being provided with a covering 
material on at least one of its large-surface 

sides, said heat insulating material (15) as covering 
material being provided with a base layer (16) for covering 

materials of brickwork- resp.insulating material 
as a facing material,
 
characterized in
 
that said base layer (16) consists of a non-woven fabric 

of synthetic materials and/or textile materials 
and/or a fabric of synthetic or glass fibers or organic 

fibers as jute ot suchlike,and that said base layer 
(16) on its side (17) facing said heat insulating material 

(15) is provided with a coating (18), said coating 
(18) being used as a liquid resistive layer and 

put on said base layer (at 19) so as to penetrate into 
the latter at a penetration depth of 1/10 to 1/2 of the 

thickness of said base layer.  
 
The insulating material according to claim 1,
 
characterized in
 
that said coating (18) is defined as a connecting layer 

between said insulating material (15) and said base 
layer (16). 
The insulating material according to any of the claims 
1 or 2
 
characterized in
 
that said base layer (16) is a non-woven fabric on polyester 

basis. 
The insulating material according to any of the claims 
1 to 3,
 
characterized in that said coating (18) is a resin, especially 

an artificial resin. 
The insulating material according to claim 4,
 
characterized in
 
that said coating (18) is an epoxy resin. 
The insulating material according to any of the claims 
1 to 5,
 
characterized in
 
that its side (20) opposite to said heat insulating 

material (15) said base layer (16) comprises an open-pore 
and/or profiled upper surface (21) for the application 

and adhesiveness of cement mortar, synthetic  
 

resin mortar or a synthetic plaster or granular synthetic 
plaster or suchlike. 
The insulating material according to any of the claims 
1 to 6,
 
characterized in
 
that said heat insulating material (15) is provided 

with a stabilizing or reinforcing fabric (27). 
The insulating material according to any of the claims 
1 to 7,
 
characterized in
 
that on the face (23) opposite to said base layer (16) 

said heat insulating material (15) is provided with 
diffusion channels (24). 
The insulating material according to any of the claims 
1 to 8,
 
characterized in
 
that on the face (23) opposite to said base layer (16) 

said heat insulating material (15) is covered with a 
metal foil (26). 
Method for preparing insulating boards for new buildings 
and those which need to be renovated for putting 

them on a bearing walling, which insulating boards, 
being multilayered building boards comprising an approximately 

rectangular board body, use polyurethane 
foam as heat insulating material, said heat insulating  

 
material on at least one of its large-surface sides being 

provided with a covering material
 
characterized in
 
that, by using two parallely movable endless conveyor 

belts, a non-woven fabric web is put on one of said 
conveyor belts after having provided it with a one-side 

coating a foaming polyurethane foam is applied to the 
coated side of said non-woven fabric and, thereafter, 

after having passed said two conveyor belts, is cut into 
boards from the endless piece as a hardened molded 

body.
