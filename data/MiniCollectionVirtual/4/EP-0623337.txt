<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low-irritant shampoo composition for the
treatment of pediculosis, which contains at least one kind of pyrethroid compound in a
physically and chemically stable state as an active ingredient.In recent years, attention has been directed mainly to the occurrence of
Pediculushumanushumanus in the group of school children on a nationwide scale.
With a rapid increase in the number of passengers, there has been also found scattered
occurrence of Pediculushumanushumanus; however, it is difficult to grasp the real state
of such occurrence because its prevalence does not come to the surface, which is now
becoming an object of public concern (see, e.g., Hifu-rinsho, Vol. 31, No. 7 (1989),
863-866; and J. Aichi Med. Univ. Assoc., Vol. 17, No. 5 (1989), 679-693).The surfactant to be blended in shampoo compositions is required to have a
low irritativeness against the skin and eyes.In particular, with respect to therapeutic agents for pediculosis caused by
Pediculushumanushumanus, which will be often applied to the infant stratum such as
school children, there has been a demand for pediculicides having as low irritativeness as
possible, which can be conveniently used.In WO-A-90/00859 a composition against lice is
disclosed comprising a pyrethroid compound in combination
with soap.Object of the present invention is to provide
a low-irritant shampoo composition containing at least one kind of pyrethroid
compound as an active ingredient in a physically and chemically stable state.
It has been found that a low-irritant shampoo composition containing a pyrethroid
compound in a stable state without any deterioration of washing and foaming properties
which are essential features of shampoos can be obtained by the use of selected nonionic
surfactants in place of ionic surfactants.Thus, the present invention provides a shampoo composition characterized in
that it comprises: 
(a) a combination of nonionic surfactants consisting of:
(1) an amine oxide of the general formula:

wherein R1 is C8-C16 alkyl, and R2 and R3 are the same or different and are C1-C2
alkyl
or hydroxyethyl;(2) a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block polymer; and(3) at least one selected from polyoxyethylene sorbitan carboxylates and
polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers; and(b) at least one pyrethroid compound as an active ingredient, which is
selected from the group consisting of:
3-phenoxybenzyl (1RS)-cis-trans-chrysanthemate (phenothrin);3-phenoxybenzyl
