<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus is designed to perform a division of the dividend number A formed from "m" words expressing a base "b", by a divider D. It includes a random-access memory (2), a multiplication device included within a computing unit (8) and furnished with a first input (xi) for "x" words of a multiplicand, with a second input (Ai) for "y" words of a multiplier. Means of accumulation are provided for adding a multiple of a quantity dbk.b

 calculated by the said multiplication device to locations of the memory (2), test means for providing an indication of the zero value of a separator S in said location and for activating the means of accumulation until the test means provide the said indication and means of decrementation for decrementing the value J with each indication. The remainder of the division is held in the lattermost locations and the quotient in the foremost locations. Application to RSA encryption.

<CLAIMS>
A device for carrying out a division of a dividend A formed by "m"
words by a divisor D formed by "n" words expressing a base "b" so as to obtain a

quotient Q and a remainder R, which device is provided with at least:

a memory for holding at least "m" words forming the dividend A
addition means for obtaining a value Q' by carrying out the operation:

A+Q'db
k
 
<
 Q''.b
n+k
+S.b
k
+R'
>

in which 
db
k
 = b
n+k
-D
 with k â‰¥ 1, until the value S becomes zero in the result which
can be written as: Q'' taking the value of Q and R' the value of R for S=0.
A device for carrying out a division, as claimed in Claim 1, of the
dividend A formed by "m" words with a base "b" by the divisor D, comprising a

active memory, a multiplication member provided with a first input for "x" words of a
multiplicand and with a second input for "y" words of a multiplier, characterized in that

the said active memory comprises locations set aside for containing at least the "m"
words of the dividend, in that accumulating means are provided for adding at these

locations a multiple of a quantity db
k
.b
J
 worked out by the said multiplication member,
testing means are provided for providing a indication of the zero value of a separator S

defined by "k" and by "J" in the said location and for activating the accumulating
means until the said testing means provide the said indication, and decrementation

means are provided for decrementing the value J by x+y at each indication, and in that
at the end of the decrementation operation the remainder of the division is contained in

the "n" last locations and the quotient is present in front of the "n+k"
th
 location at the
end of the decrementation of "J".
A device for carrying out a division as claimed in Claim 2, characterized

in that the testing means are active in a verification phase by adding a quantity db
k
.b
J
 to
the quantity contained in the portions of the said location defined by J in order to

examine whether this addition provides a carry-over and to actively add this quantity 
db
k
.b
J
 if a carry-over is indeed the result.
A smart card provided with a device as claimed in ay of Claims 1 to 3.
