<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing a coating 
equipment and an operation method thereof which can 

promptly produce coating strips of a variety of kinds 
required by users at production cost approximate to 

that of hot rolling coating materials, without rolling 
thin strips which cannot be easily rolled by a hot 

strip mill. 
The coating equipment of the invention comprises 
coil uncoilers 50a, 50b, a strip welder 2, a picking 

tank 5, a heating and deoxidizing furnace 12, a 
coating pot 13 and a coiler 51 sequentially disposed 

in order named. At least one stand of rolling mill 7 
is interposed between the pickling tank 5 and the 

heating and deoxidizing furnace 12. A first step of 
opening the rolling mill 7 for empty pass and carrying 

out coating treatment in the coating pot 13 and a 
second step of carrying out the coating treatment in 

the coating pot 13 after cold rolling is effected by 
the rolling mill 7 are selectively carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coating system for 
coating hot rolled strip material. As described, for example, in "SEITETSU KIKAI 
SETSUBI SORAN" (Handbook of Iron Manufacturing Machine 
and Equipment; published on March 25, 1980), in a 
coating equipment for producing a coated strip with a 
material of hot-rolling strip coil (which will be 
sometimes referred to as a "hot coil"), the hot coil 
is passed sequentially through a coil uncoiler, a 
strip welder, a pickling line and a heating and 
deoxidizing furnace, then coated in a coating pot, and 
thereafter passed through a skin pass mill, etc, to 
provide a product. The product manufactured by such 
an equipment is called a "coating strip of hot 
rolling". On the other hand, as described, for example, in 
JP-A-122611/1981, a coating 
strip of cold rolling is produced by an equipment 
wherein a hot coil is first passed through a pickling 
line, then through a tandem type cold rolling mill 
having a differential speed rolling mill at its 
preceding stage, and thereafter through a coating line 
for coating strip of cold rolling. In this equipment, 
the pickling line, the rolling mill, the coating line, 
etc, are generally constituted as mutually independent 
equipments, and each of them is equipped with an 
uncoiler and a coiler for sequentially passing the hot  
 
coil through each of these independent lines. 
According to this technology 
a treatment 
process as independent equipments and its continuing 
treatment process are selected by providing an 
uncoiler and a coiler to each of the pickling line, 
rolling mill and coating line so as to combine them 
as independent equipments, combining them and 
controlling the matching between them by a process 
computer. Further, the JP-A-64403/1982 
describes an equipment in which a hot coil is passed 
through a descaling apparatus, rolled by a plurality 
of passes through a reverse cold rolling mill and 
thereafter passed through a cold-rolled material 
coating line. This equipment is provided with strip 
storage devices on the entry and exit sides of the 
reverse cold rolling mill, respectively. Among the equipments described above, integrated 
steel makers producing steel products from hot coils 
mostly use a tandem type cold rolling mill in the 
rolling line, whereas merely-rolling manufactures who 
do not produce hot coils by themselves but purchase 
them from other manufacturers mostly employ a reverse 
cold rolling mill. However, the prior art technologies described 
above are not free from the following
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A coating system for continuously coating hot rolled 
strip material comprising the following sequentially disposed 

system stations: 

a hot rolling coil uncoiler station (50a, 50b), 
a pickling tank station (5), 
a cold rolling mill station (7) including a cold rolling 
control system (9, 29 to 34) for effecting single pass rolling of the 

strip material (1) with a predetermined thickness reduction 
during operation with strip material thicker than desired 

for coating and for effecting passage of the strip material 
through the cold rolling mill station without rolling 

during operation with strip material of a desired thickness 
for coating, 
a heating and deoxidizing furnace station (12) and 
a coating station (13). 
Coating system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a skinpass mill station (19) and a coiler station (51) is arranged 

in sequence downstream of the coating station (13). 
Coating system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a strip welder station (2) is arranged between the hot 

rolling coil uncoiler station (50a, 50b) and the pickling station (5), 
said strip weld station including welding means for welding together 

separate strip material sections from the uncoiler station to 
thereby provide a continuous strip of strip material for 

processing in said other stations. 
Coating system according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that said 

cold rolling mill station consists of a single cold rolling mill 
stand (7).  

 
Coating system according to one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that said 

cold rolling mill station includes a plurality of 
cold rolling mill stands (7A to 7C) arranged in series and control 

means or controlling said rolling mill stands so that a 
selected one of said mill stands permits pass through of 

said strip material without rolling while at least one 
other of said rolling mill stands cold rolls said strip 

material in a single pass. 
Coating system according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that at least one of said 

cold rolling mill stands is a six high rolling mill stand 
having work roll bending means and intermediate rolls shifting 

means. 
Coating system according to Claim 5, characterized in that said 
cold rolling mill station includes three cold rolling mill stands 

(7A to 7C) being selectively operable with rolling at two stands to 
facilitate continuous operation while changing rollers at the third 

stand.
