<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for generating pulses, in particular resetting pulses for counters or microprocessors (30) is proposed, which contains a comparator (10) which compares a voltage which can be tapped from a capacitor (12) to a predetermined threshold value. The circuit arrangement contains a semiconductor switch (23) which influences the voltage across the capacitor (12), for example by short-circuiting to earth (21), as a function of a signal (31) to be monitored which is output by the microprocessor (30). A lower limit frequency for the signal (31) to be monitored is predetermined by a high-pass arrangement (27). An upper limit frequency for the signal (31) to be monitored is established using a protective circuit of the semiconductor switch (23), which circuit lowers the limits of the switching frequency to the desired value. The limiting of the switching rate is possible, for example, using a high-resistance design of the control circuit.

Circuit arrangement for producing pulses,
particularly reset pulses for counters or

microprocessors (30), having a comparator (10)
which compares a voltage which can be tapped off

on a capacitor (12) with a prescribed threshold
value, and having a switching transistor (23) for

influencing the capacitor voltage, whose control
input (25) is connected to a high-pass filter

arrangement (26) and is driven by a signal (31)
which is to be monitored, 
characterized in that
 a
resistor (24) is connected in series with the

switching path of the switching transistor (23) to
the latter's collector, and the dimensioning of

the resistor (24) limits the upper limit of the
switching frequency of the switching transistor

(23) to a prescribed value which corresponds to a
prescribed maximum permissible frequency of the

signal (31) to be monitored.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the switching transistor
provided is a transistor whose base connection or

gate connection is connected via a further nonreactive
resistor (27) to the signal (31) to be

monitored.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 1
or 2, 
characterized in that
 the circuit 
arrangement outputs the produced signals as a

periodic pulse train if the signal (31) to be
monitored falls below or exceeds a prescribed cut-off

frequency.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 1
to 3, 
characterized in that
 a voltage monitoring
circuit (34) is provided which outputs an output

signal (35) which overlies the produced pulses.
Circuit arrangement according to one of Claims 2
to 4, 
characterized in that
 the further resistor
(27) is part of the high-pass filter arrangement

(26) which contains the further resistor (27) and
a capacitor (28).
