<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic powder is disclosed which is characterized by 
possessing a powder compression characteristic such that the 

magnetic powder, after being packed in a closed container, 
pressed at a load of 400 kgf/cm³, and relieved of the load, 

exhibits a packing density in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 g/cm³ and 
a geometric standard deviation of not more than 1.5 in the 

particle diameter distribution. A magnetic recording medium 
using the magnetic powder mentioned above has high packing 

and, consequently, secures high output, and has ample 
diminution of noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
magnetic recording medium using a magnetic powder.A magnetic recording medium of the type which is produced
by application of a coat is composed of a supporting substrate
made of such a nonmagnetic material as polyethylene
terephthalate and a magnetic layer formed mainly of a magnetic
powder and a binder resin and superposed on the supporting
substrate.The magnetic powders heretofore used for magnetic
recording media include needle like magnetic powders such as
of γ-Fe2O3, Co-coated γ-FeO3, Co-doped γ-Fe2O3, Co-coated Fe3O4,
and metallic Fe, for example. For the magnetic recording
media using these needle like magnetic powders, the
longitudinal magnetic recording method utilizing the
magnetization which is effected in the longitudinal direction
relative to the surface of a magnetic layer has been adopted.This longitudinal magnetic recording method, however, has
proved unfit for high-density recording and reproducing
because the effect of a demagnetized field gains in
conspicuity in proportion as the recording density exalts. In recent years, therefore, the perpendicular magnetic
recording method utilizing the magnetization which is effected
in the perpendicular direction relative to the surface of a
magnetic layer has been proposed. This perpendicular magnetic
recording method may well be regarded as optimal for high-density
recording because this magnetization gains all the
more in stability in proportion as the recording density
exalts.As magnetic recording media fit for this perpendicular
magnetic recording method, the magnetic recording media which
are obtained by depositing a Co-Cr alloy on a supporting
substrate, for example, by such a vacuum technique as the
vacuum deposition method or the spattering method and the
magnetic recording media which are obtained by applying a
hexagonal system ferrite powder having an axis of easy
magnetization in a direction perpendicular to a surface
together with a binder resin to a supporting substrate have
been known.The magnetic recording media which are produced by the
vacuum technique have various problems pertaining to ability
to withstand weather conditions, capability of mass
production, and production cost, whereas the magnetic
recording media which are produced by the coating technique
have great promise of success and are attracting attention
because they allow ready use of conventional manufacturing
facilities and, what is more, excel in capability of mass
production.As concrete examples of the hexagonal system ferrite 
powder
