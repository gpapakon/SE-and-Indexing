<ABSTRACT>
To solve problems when using an AUDIO type memory, with defective cells without having to run the risks of the presence of groups of defective cells in such memories, there is provision to store the sounds to be recorded at random, or rather pseudo-random, addresses in the memory. It is shown that by acting in this way it is possible, when reading by following one and the same pseudo-random sequence, to restore a coherent sound whilst moreover being rather undemanding as regards the quality of the memory circuits used.

<CLAIMS>
Device for storage of coherent data following on from each 
other in memory words of a random access memory having a 

pseudo-random address generator for distributing the 
successive data to pseudo-random addresses in the memory, 

characterised in that it includes, in the pseudo-random 
address generator, a first circuit for successively delivering 

pseudo-random binary words of P bits representing first parts 
of address signals, and a second circuit for successively 

delivering contiguous binary words of Q bits representing 
second parts of address signals, a device for making the first 

and second circuits evolve in synchronism and a circuit for 
concatenating first and second address signal parts and thus 

creating a random address of P+Q bits, so as to distribute 
successive data in different geographical sectors of the 

memory. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
includes, in the memory, an arrangement of N (N=4) integrated 

storage circuits each organized into 2
M
 (M=22) memory words 
whose length is R (R=1) bits, these N integrated circuits 

being connected, by their data bus with R conductors, 
respectively to R different conductors of a data bus with NxR 

conductors of the memory, these N integrated storage circuits 
being connected in parallel to one and the same address bus 

with M conductors. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
first and second circuits have forcing inputs to force their 

outputs into a given state. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
first and the second circuits have a pseudo-random period of 2
P
 
binary states and in that the second circuit has a period of 2
Q
 
binary states.  

 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that R is 
equal to 1. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that it includes a circuit for calculation of a preceding 

random address on the basis of knowledge of a current 
addresses. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
calculation circuit includes a microprocessor and a program 

memory, the microprocessor being connected to this program 
memory to run a microprogram contained in this program memory. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the concatenation circuit includes a multiplexer. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that the memory is a dynamic memory.
