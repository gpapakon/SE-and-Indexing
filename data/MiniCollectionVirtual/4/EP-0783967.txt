<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to ink jet printing apparatus, and
more particularly, to ink jet printing apparatus for
driving a plurality of ink jet printheads, see for example
US-A-5 477 245.Ink jet printing systems are available which have either
a single printhead, or multiple printheads. In systems
having multiple printheads, a separate printhead
controller/driver circuit is provided for each
printhead. Although providing a separate printhead
controller/driver for each printhead simplifies the
design implementation, such duplication typically
results in an increase in cost for each printhead
controller/driver added to the system.The invention provides an ink jet printing apparatus
which includes a single printhead controller capable of
controlling a plurality of printheads. The printhead
controller of the invention includes a printhead driver
circuit having a set of ink jet nozzle control outputs
and a printhead select circuit providing a plurality of
possible printhead select outputs. Each printhead of
the invention includes a plurality of ink jet nozzles, a
plurality of individually controllable ink jet nozzle
firing circuits, and a printhead enable circuit. The
printhead enable circuit of each printhead is
electrically coupled between the plurality of
individually controllable ink jet nozzle firing circuits
of the printhead and the set of ink jet nozzle control
outputs of the printhead driver circuit. The set of ink
jet nozzle control outputs is common to each of the
plurality of printheads. The printhead enable circuit
is electrically coupled to receive the plurality of
printhead select outputs and enables the electrical
conduction of the plurality of controllable ink jet 
nozzle firing circuits of that printhead upon receipt of
a printhead select signal from the printhead select
circuit.The printhead select circuit supplies a printhead select
signal to the enable circuit of one of the plurality of
printheads via one of the printhead select outputs to
select that printhead for printing. The printhead
driver circuit then supplies control signals via the set
of ink jet nozzle control outputs to control the
plurality of individually controllable ink jet nozzle
firing circuits of the selected printhead for
controlling the output of ink from the ink jet nozzle
corresponding to each ink jet nozzle firing circuit.Other features and advantages of the invention may be
determined from the drawings and the following detailed
description of an embodiment of the invention given by
way of example only.Fig. 1
