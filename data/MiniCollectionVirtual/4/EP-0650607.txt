<ABSTRACT>
Imageable articles containing interfacial barriers comprising a layer of a polymeric organic acid containing carboxyl and/or sulfo groups in direct contact with an adjacent layer comprising a basic polymer capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the polymeric organic acid are disclosed. A crosslinked barrier is formed at the interface between the layers which has substantial impermeability to chemical diffusion. In a preferred embodiment, the imageable article is a photothermographic, dry silver-based imageable article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to imageable articles and more particularly, this
invention relates to photothermographic articles which contain barrier layers
composed of interpolymer complexes.Multilayer imageable articles are known in the art with various color-forming
layers separated from each other by barrier interlayers. Additionally, it is common
practice in the imageable arts to apply a protective barrier layer to the top surface of
an imageable construction in order to prevent abrasion and environmental
deterioration of the imageable construction. In both of these applications,
impermeability to chemical diffusion is an important factor in determining the
success of the barrier layer.Photothermographic articles having at least two or three distinct color image-forming
layers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,021,240 and 4,460,681. The barrier
layers are "functional" when ingredients active in the formation of color are included
therein. The layers are considered "non-functional" when no ingredients active in the
formation of dye images or silver images are included within that layer.U.S. Pat. No. 4,021,240 discloses the use of interlayers of polyvinyl alcohol
for preserving the integrity of multiple color-forming layers. Other hydrophilic
polymers, such as gelatin, are also disclosed as being useful. The use of other
synthetic polymeric binders, alone or in combination, as vehicles or binding agents
in various layers is described. Useful resins such as polyvinyl butyral, cellulose
acetate butyrate, polymethyl methacrylate, ethyl cellulose, polystyrene, polyvinyl 
chloride, chlorinated rubber, butadiene-styrene copolymers, and vinylchloride-vinyl
acetate copolymers are also disclosed.By the present invention, it has now been discovered that effective barrier
layers to chemical diffusion of ingredients between the imaging layers of an
imageable article may be made by coating a layer comprising a polymeric organic
acid containing carboxyl andlor sulfo groups adjacent to a layer comprising a basic
polymer capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl and/or sulfo groups
of the polymeric organic acid. The resulting crosslinked, hydrogen bonded structure
can be chemically termed "an interpolymer complex."Thus, the present invention provides an imageable article comprising a layer
comprising an acidic polymer containing carboxyl andlor sulfo groups, the layer being
adjacent to another layer comprising a basic polymer capable of forming hydrogen
bonds with the polymeric acid.In one possible arrangement,
