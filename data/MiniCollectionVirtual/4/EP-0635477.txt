<ABSTRACT>
Carbonates containing aromatic ester groups can be prepared by reaction of aromatic monohydroxy compounds with phosgene or with chlorocarbonic acid esters of aromatic monohydroxy compounds, the reaction being carried out at a temperature in the range from 50 to 350 DEG C in the presence of aluminium oxides as heterogeneous catalysts.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing aryl carbonates by reacting 
aromatic monohydroxy compounds with phosgene or 

chloroformates of aromatic monohydroxy compounds, 
characterised in that the reaction is performed at a 

temperature in the range 50 to 350°C at a pressure of 
0.2 to 20 bar in the presence of one or more aluminium 

oxides as heterogeneous catalysts. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
one or more activated aluminium oxides or α-aluminium 

oxides with a surface area determined by the BET 
method of 2 to 500 m
2
/g are used as catalysts, in 
amounts of 0.5 to 100 wt.%, with reference to the 

amount of monohydroxy compound, in a not fully 
continuous mode of operation or with amounts of 0.1 to 

20 g of monohydroxy compound per g of catalyst per 
hour in a fully continuous mode of operation.
