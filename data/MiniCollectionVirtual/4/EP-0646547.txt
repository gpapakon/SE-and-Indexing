<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for treating biogenic residues, in particular sewage sludges arising in biological waste water purification, liquid manure, other microbiological and growing biomasses and biogenic residual refuse fractions. According to the invention it is proposed that the biogenic masses are subjected to both a heat-activated liquid phase hydrolysis and also to an anaerobic fermentation, essentially a hydrolysate containing the water-soluble cleavage products, a gas usable for combustion, a utilisable or landfillable residue substantially freed from organic components and pollutants and a separate heavy metal fraction arising.
