<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel catalyst for
producing an aromatic vinyl compound polymer and a process
for producing an aromatic vinyl compound polymer by using the
same. More particularly, it pertains to a novel catalyst
which comprises a trivalent titanium compound and is capable
of efficiently producing a polymer or a copolymer of an
aromatic vinyl compound having such a high degree of syndiotactic
configuration in its aromatic vinyl chain of the polymer or
copolymer (hereinafter sometimes referred to generically as
"(co)polymer") that the proportion of the racemic diads is at least 75% and a process for producing a polymer or a
copolymer of an aromatic vinyl compound by the use of said
catalyst.Heretofore, styrenic polymers produced by the radical
polymerization method have an atactic
configuration in stereostructure and are molded to various
shapes by various molding methods such as injection molding,
extrusion molding, blow molding, vacuum molding and cast
molding, and they have been widely used as domestic
electrical appliances, office machines, household goods,
packaging containers, toys, furnitures, synthetic papers,
sheets, films and other industrial materials.However, such styrenic polymers having atactic 
configuration have disadvantage that it is inferior in heat
resistance and chemical resistance.The group to which the present inventor belongs has
previously succeeded in developing styrenic polymers having a
high degree of syndiotacticity (see Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open Nos. 187708/1987, 179906/1988,
241009/1988, 249504/1992 etc.).Since the styrene polymers having a syndiotactic
configuration have melting points which are different from
those of the conventional atactic polystyrenes, and are
higher than those of the isotactic polystyrenes known so far,
they are expected to be used as heat-resistant resins in
various field.However, in order to obtain a high performance catalyst
capable of efficiently producing a styrenic polymer having a
syndiotactic configuration, it has heretofore been necessary
to prepare the catalyst by the use of a tetravalent titanium
complex, thus complicating the preparation procedures
including synthesis and purification and generally lowering
the synthetic efficiency. On the other hand, the use of a
catalyst prepared by using a trivalent titanium compound
results in a decrease in the catalytic activity and in the
formation of a styrenic polymer having a low degree of
syndiotacticity and/or mixture of a styrenic polymer having a
syndiotactic
