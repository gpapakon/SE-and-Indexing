<ABSTRACT>
The wire (conductor) connecting device for weak-current installations, having means for solder-free wire connection, comprises at least one longitudinal channel (2), for accommodating a wire (30), on a housing part (1). In this case, each longitudinal channel (2) interacts in its axial direction with a contact region (6), which extends tangentially with respect to the inserted wire, of a contact pin (16), and with at least one clamping pin (7), which likewise extends tangentially with respect to the inserted wire. The contact region (6) of the contact pin (16) and the clamping pin (7) in this case project into the longitudinal channel (2) in such a manner that, when the wire (30) is inserted, a predetermined contact pressure can be produced on the stripped region of the said wire (30).

A conductor connecting device for low-current
installations, with devices for solderless wiring,

comprising at least one longitudinal channel on an
enclosure part to accommodate a conductor of a

data cable, etc., where each longitudinal channel
works together in its axial direction with an

insulation piercing connecting device terminal
that extends tangentially to the inserted conductor

and projects into the longitudinal channel,

characterized in that

the insulation piercing connecting device terminal
comprises, on one side of an inserted conductor

and tangential to it, a contact cutting device (6)
of a contact pin (16) and at least one clamping

post (7) or clamping cam (7') of a data cable,
etc., on the other side of the inserted conductor

and tangential to it,
where the contact cutting device (6) of the
contact pin (16) and the clamping post (7) or

clamping cam (7') project into the longitudinal
channel (2; 2') in such a way that a predetermined

contact pressure can be adjusted on the stripped
area of the inserted conductor (30).
A conductor connecting device according to claim
1, characterized in that the central spacing (66)

of the contact cutting device (6) on the contact
side is smaller that the radius of the stripped

conductor, and the central spacing (77) of the
clamping post (7) or clamping cam (7') is smaller

than or equal to the radius of the stripped
conductor.
A conductor connecting device according to claim
1, characterized in that the longitudinal channel 

(2) extends as a hole in a block-shaped wire
enclosure (1) having cross holes (3, 4) running

through it tangentially from both sides in its
axial direction to accommodate at least one

contact cutting device (6) of a contact pin (16)
or to accommodate at least one clamping post (7)

on a clamping plate (17).
A conductor connecting device according to claim
1, characterized in that parallel trough-shaped

longitudinal channels (2') with integrally molded
clamping cams (7') and arranged contact pins (16)

run along enclosure part (1') having a swing cover
(60) intended for crimping the conductor (30).
A conductor connecting device according to claim
1, characterized in that a clamping post (7) or

clamping cam (7') and a contact cutting device (6)
are opposite each other on the two sides of the

longitudinal channel (2; 2').
A conductor connecting device according to claim
1, characterized in that the contact cutting

device (6) stands in the gap between two opposing
clamping posts (7) or clamping cams (7') to force

the conductor into a wave pattern along its
extent.
A conductor connecting device according to claim
1, characterized in that the clamping posts (7) or

clamping cams (7') and the respective contact pins
(16) or contact cutting edges (6) are arranged in

the gaps or in succession in the longitudinal
extent of the conductors (30), to contact each of

the tightly arranged conductors.
A conductor connecting device according to claim 
3, characterized in that the contact pins (6, 16)

and the clamping posts (7) can be pressed into the
wire enclosure (1) from the same side or from the

opposite side.
A conductor connecting device according to claim
4, characterized in that the swing cover (60) is

provided with side flanges (61) overlapping with
the external side walls of the enclosure part (1')

with practically no play.
