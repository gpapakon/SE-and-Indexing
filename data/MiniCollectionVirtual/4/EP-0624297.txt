<ABSTRACT>
A communication system comprises a signal carrying medium (8) coupled to a series of end station ports (2-5). The end station ports (2-5) enable respective end stations (21) to transmit signals onto and receive signals from the medium (8). A controller (7) is provided to control the connection of the end stations (21) to the medium (8) via the ports (2-5). Monitors (9-12) are connected to the controller (7) to monitor characteristics of signals generated by the end stations (21) coupled to the ports. The monitors (9-12) are connected in parallel to the medium (8) and supply information relating to the monitored signals to the controller (7) in use. This system allows faulty end stations to be identified and removed from the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a communication system, for
example a ring communication system or a bus based system,
having a number of end station ports which enable
respective end stations (such as computers and word
processing terminals) to transmit onto and receive signals
from a signal carrying medium.Communication systems of this type are highly
sophisticated and rely on complex protocols to enable
communication to be achieved between end stations connected
to the signal carrying medium. Examples of such protocols
are the token ring protocol and the FDDI system. These
protocols incorporate certain fault recovery procedures if
a fault should arise within the system. However, with
increasing numbers of end stations being connected to
communication systems, the existing fault recovery
techniques tend to be slow and in addition the existing
fault recovery procedures provide incomplete protection
against the erroneous operation of the end stations
themselves, nor against any out of specification operation
of the system.Conventionally, ports are grouped into so-called hub
units which themselves can incorporate certain intelligence
to enable faults to be detected. For example, in one type
of hub unit, additional stations are incorporated on the
system within the hub which are used simply to detect if
the network or system is operational or faulty. Internal
control circuits can then process the information returned
by these additional stations and force other end stations
connected to the hub to be removed in turn until the
network or system is again operational.EP-A-0431635 describes a ring-type LAN which includes
a fault processing system in which when the occurrence of
a fault is detected at a station at the downstream side of
the station at which the fault has occurred, the
neighbouring downstream station continues transmitting a
fault notifying frame and when the transmission time 
exceeds a predetermined time, a loopback is formed at the
upstream side and a loopback is also formed at the
downstream side.In EP-A-0222669, a segmentation process is carried out
when a fault is detected on a port of the hub. The hub
will reconnect a "segmented" port when reception is
completed with no errors.As mentioned above, these fault recovery techniques
are slow particularly in practical implementations where
more than 80 end stations may be connected to a single hub.
Multiple faults will further increase fault recovery time.In accordance with the present invention, a local area
network communication system comprises a
