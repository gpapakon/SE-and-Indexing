<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to synchronous semiconductor
circuit assemblies and particularly to synchronous dynamic
random access memories packaged in a multiple memory unit or
module.Synchronous memory devices are a recent addition to the large
portfolio of semiconductor memories. Virtually all of currently
available semiconductor Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and
Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) devices use asychronous
clocking systems in that the clocking signals necessary to
perform memory access functions are not synchronized to that of
an associated system processor. Although memories are
initiated by signals sent by the processor, the exact time
interval between the time a request is sent to a memory and the
time a response will be received is dependent on the
particular internal features of the memory. Thus, it becomes
necessary for system designers to allow for the "worse case"
response time between requests for information and the
anticipated time the information will be available. Such
clocking systems have led to great amounts of wasted time in
the handling of memory functions in computer processors.While semiconductor processing technologies have enabled logic
components such as microprocessors to operate at in excess of
100 megahertz (MHz) clock rates, memory systems have until
recently not met the same rates because of the nature of the
operations necessary to be performed.In order to meet the challenge of high speed processors,
synchronous memory devices have been described. These memories
are responsive to a high frequency clock signals generated by
the processor, or at least in synchronization with the 
processor, which render all internal activity within the memory
"synchronous" with other devices responsive to the same clock
signals.Currently, several synchronous memory designs have been
proposed and fabricated. These memory devices have the
capability of utilizing external clock rates of nearly the same
rates as that of processors.A particular problem presented by the proposed use of
synchronous memory devices lies in the packaging and clock
distribution of clock signals within memory packages. Due to
the extremely high frequency of the clock pulses used the
successful design of clock distribution networks has been
frustrated by failure.Referring to Fig. 1 there is shown a typical DRAM SIMM package
10 having a plurality of memory modules 12 mounted on one or
both sides. Input/output pins 14 are provided to access
modules on the package. Synchronous clocking signals are
