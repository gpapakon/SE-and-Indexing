<ABSTRACT>
An earth-boring bit (11) has a bit body (13) and at least 
one cutter (21,23,25) rotatably secured to the bit body 

(13). The cutter (21,23,25) has a cutter shell surface 
including a gage surface (31) intersecting a heel surface 

(41). A plurality of hard metal inserts are arranged in 
generally circumferential rows on the cutter (21,23,25) and 

include a heel row of heel inserts (43) on the heel surface 
(41) of the cutter (21,23,25) and a gage row of gage inserts 

(33) on the gage surface (31) of the cutter (21,23,25). At 
least one scraper insert (51), formed of material more 

wear-resistant than that of the cutter shell surface, is 
secured to the cutter shell surface generally at the 

intersection of the gage and heel surfaces (31,41). The 
scraper insert (51) includes a gage and heel insert surface 

(57,55). The gage and heel surfaces (57,55) of the scraper 
insert (51) converge to define a cutting edge (59) for 

engagement with the sidewall (205) of the borehole, the 
insert surface defining a positive rake angle with respect 

to the sidewall (205) of the borehole of between 0 and 15 
degrees. The cutting edge (59) projecting from the heel 

surface (41) an amount not greater than the lesser of 
one-half the projection of the heel inserts (43) from the 

heel surface (41) and 30% of the pitch between the heel 
inserts (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
earth-boring drill bits. More particularly, the present
invention relates to improved cutting structures or
geometries for earth-boring drill bits.The success of rotary drilling enabled the
discovery of deep oil and gas reservoirs. The rotary rock
bit was an important invention that made the success of
rotary drilling possible. Only soft earthen formations could
be penetrated commercially with the earlier drag bit, but
the two-cone rock bit, invented by Howard R. Hughes, U.S.
Patent N° 930,759, drilled the caprock at the Spindletop
field, near Beaumont, Texas with relative ease. That
venerable invention within the first decade of this century
could drill a scant fraction of the depth and speed of the
modern rotary rock bit. The original Hughes bit drilled for
hours, the modern bit drills for days. Modern bits sometimes
drill for thousands of feet instead of merely a few feet.
Many advances have contributed to the impressive
improvements in rotary rock bits.In drilling boreholes in earthen formations by
the rotary method, rotary rock bits having one, two, or
three rolling cutters rotatably mounted thereon are
employed. The bit is secured to the lower end of a
drillstring that is rotated from the surface or by downhole
motors or turbines. The cutters are mounted on the bit roll
and slide upon the bottom of the borehole as the drillstring
is rotated, thereby engaging and disintegrating the
formation material to be removed. The roller cutters are
provided with teeth that are forced to penetrate and gouge
the bottom of the borehole by weight from the drillstring.The cuttings from the bottom and sides of the
borehole are washed away by drilling fluid that is pumped 
down from the surface through the hollow rotating
drillstring, and are carried in suspension in the drilling
fluid to the surface. The form and location of the teeth or
inserts upon the cutters have been found to be extremely
important to the successful operation of the bit. Certain
aspects of the design of the cutters become particularly
important if the bit is to penetrate deep into a formation
to effectively strain and induce failure in the formation
material.The current trend in rolling cutter earth-boring
bit design is toward coarser, more aggressive cutting
structures or geometries with widely spaced teeth or
inserts. These widely spaced teeth prevent balling and
increase bit speed through relatively soft, low compressive
strength formation materials such as shales and siltstones.
