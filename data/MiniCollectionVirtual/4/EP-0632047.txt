<ABSTRACT>
The sulphonation of arylphosphines, that is mono-, di-, oligo- and polyphosphines which contain at least one aromatic radical which can be sulphonated, is carried out according to the invention in the presence of a Lewis acid. The novel process is distinguished by avoidance of side reactions, in particular the formation of phosphine oxides. When working up the sulphonation mixture, the Lewis acid can be removed together with the sulphuric acid.

A process for preparing sulfonated arylphosphines by
sulfonation of aryl-containing mono-, di-, oligo- or

polyphosphines with oleum, which comprises carrying
out the sulfonation at temperatures between 0 and

80째C in the presence of Lewis acids.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
sulfonation of the arylphosphine is carried out at

temperatures between 10 and 50째C.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
sulfonation is carried out by adding oleum to a

solution of arylphosphine and Lewis acid in concentrated
sulfuric acid.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
3, wherein the Lewis acid is a boron compound.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the boron
compound is boric acid.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
5, wher
ein the Lewis acid is used in at least a
molar amount based on the P(III) atoms contained in

the arylphosphine to be sulfonated.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1,
2, 3, 5 and 6, wherein the solution of arylphosphine

in concentrated sulfuric acid is saturated with
boric acid.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
7, wherein the sulfonation mixture is diluted with

water and the aqueous solution obtained is extracted
with the solution of a water-insoluble amine in a

water-insoluble organic solvent, using from 0.5 to
3 mol of the amine per chemical equivalent of 

sulfonic acid, the organic phase is separated off
and brought into intimate contact with the aqueous

solution of a base, after which the aqueous phase is
separated off and the sulfonated arylphosphine is

isolated therefrom.
The process as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
sulfonation mixture is, while maintaining a temperature

between 0 and 40째C, in particular 0 and 20째C,
admixed with the amount of water required to dilute

the sulfuric acid present to from 0.5 to 50% by
weight, preferably from 25 to 35% by weight.
The process as claimed in claim 8 or 9, wherein from
0.5 to 2.5 mol of amine are used per chemical

equivalent of sulfonic acid.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 8 to
10, wherein the concentration of the amine in the

amine solution is from 1.0 to 35% by weight, preferably
from 10 to 30% by weight and in particular

from 13 to 25% by weight, in each case based on the
solution.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 8 to
11, wherein the water-insoluble amines are open-chain,

branched or unbranched aliphatic amines
having from 10 to 60, preferably from 13 to 36,

carbon atoms.
The process as claimed in claim 12, wherein the
amine is tri-n-octylamine, triisooctylamine,

diisooctylamine, tri-2-ethylhexylamine or tridodecylamine.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 8 to
13, wherein the water-insoluble organic solvent is

an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon or a hydrocarbon
mixture. 
The process as claimed in claim 14, wherein the
solvent is toluene or kerosine.
