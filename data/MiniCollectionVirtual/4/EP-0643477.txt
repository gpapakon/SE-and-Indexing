<ABSTRACT>
A sigma-delta signal converter is implemented using switched capacitor 
switching elements in which a first switch (31) serves as a mixer (11). 
The 
output of the mixer is directed to the second input of an adder (16), and its 

second input is the feedback signal (f1) of the sigma-delta signal converter, 
which is also directed into a base-frequency output signal through a 

decimator (14) and low-pass filtering (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a receive arrangement for receiving a modulated
carrier signal.EP 0 461 720-A1 describes a known receive arrangement for receiving a
modulated carrier signal, comprising a mixer/demodulator driven with a
sinusoidal oscillator of carrier frequency fc, at least one adder, a low-pass
filter, a pulse shaper constituting a one-bit sigma-delta signal converter, all
included in a closed signal loop, the pulse shaper being driven with sampling
frequency fs, and further comprising a digital decimation filter. In this type
of receive arrangement the modulated carrier signal is demodulated in the
closed signal loop by the mixer/demodulator, the output signal of which is
converted after passing through the low-pass filter into a digital signal by the
sigma-delta converter.A typical prior art sigma-delta converter arrangement is described in greater
detail with reference to Figure 1 of the drawings.An incoming intermediate frequency IF carrier signal is provided to each
branch of the receive arrangement. In each branch the incoming signal is
filtered through bandpass filter 1 and mixed to a baseband signal in a linear
mixer 2 using a sinusoidal local oscillator signal LO1 at the IF frequency. A
high time constant capacitor 3 is provided on each of the incoming signal
branches to remove direct currents from the baseband signal. The gain of the
circuit is controlled through Automatic Gain Controllers (AGC) 5 and the
baseband signals are converted to digital signals in modulators 6. After
modulation the signals pass through respective decimators 7 and post filters
8 to remove spurious signals created by the decimators. The specific details 
of the local oscillator frequency and phase shifts of the particular
arrangement illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:
PHI1 = +45°PHI2 = -45°PHI3 = PHI4 = 0°LO1 = IFLO2 = oversampling frequencyThe demodulation, i.e., the mixing of the intermediate frequency (bandpass-filtered)
int-signal down to the base frequency is traditionally based on the
use of a multiplier. Thus the modulated IF-signal is multiplied by the
sinusoidal oscillator signal (LO1). In the synchronous demodulation the
frequency and the phase of the oscillator are locked to the carrier wave with
the aid of a phase-locked loop (PLL), for instance. The frequency spectrum of
the mixed product consists of the desired base-frequency component and the
component spectrums which are removed by low-pass filtering prior to
entering the sigma-delta converter. Such a mixing process may be described
by
