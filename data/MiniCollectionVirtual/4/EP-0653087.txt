<ABSTRACT>
Described is a system for remotely reading out data from a multiplicity of measurement units (10), the system operating by radio transmission at a single frequency. The various measurement units (10) deliver their sets of data within stochastically selected time windows of short duration. In this way, the measurement units can have simply designed circuitry and can be operated over very long periods from long-life batteries.

A method for transferring measured data from a 
plurality of metering units (10) to a central processing 

unit (16), wherein 

a) the metering units (10) are connected to the processing 
unit (16) at different times through a radio 

data transfer channel; 
b) the measured data to be transferred and an identifying 
signal characterizing the respective metering unit 

(10) are combined in the metering unit (10) to form 
a data set; 
c) the metering units (10) supply their data sets to 
the data transfer channel at times being determined 

in stochastic manner; and 
d) the processing unit (16) eliminates from the succession 
of signals received at the operating frequency those 

corresponding to overlapping data sets and accepts 
the successions of signals remaining after such elimination 

and corresponding to a single data set for 
further processing; 
 
characterized in that
 
   e) the metering units (10) store measured data sets 

in regular intervals and define a plurality of stochastically 
distributed transmission times lying between 

the data storing times.  
 
The method as in claim 1, characterized as in that the metering units (10) store the previously sent 
measured data and in that stochastic determination of 

the next send time is effected or activated only then, 
when the actual measured data differ from the previously 

sent measured data by more than a predetermined amount. 
The method as in claim 1 or 2 characterized in that 
the metering units (10) calculate from the measured 

data to be transferred a check number in accordance with 
a predetermined algorithm and in that a corresponding 

check signal is associated to the measured data to form 
an extended data set, in that the processing unit (16) 

separates the check signal from the extended data set, 
calculates in accordance with said predetermined algorithm 

a countercheck-check number from the measured data and 
stores a transferred data set only, if the check number 

corresponding to the transmitted check signal and the 
countercheck-check number are equal. 
The method as in one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the processing unit (16) stores the time, when 

a data set was received, together with a data set, which 
has been recognized as a correct data set. 
The method as in claim 4, characterized in that a 
clock circuit (50) of the processing unit (16) is 

intermittently reset to standard time. 
The method as in one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the processing unit (16) compares a correctly 

transmitted data set with at least one of the previously 
received data sets recurring to predetermined criteria 

and stores a new data set only, if the latter satisfies 
these criteria.  

 
The method as in claim 6, characterized in that the 
processing unit (16) records data sets not satisfying 

said predetermined criteria, preferably storing these data 
sets together with the time, when they have been received, 

and the kind of non-compliance with these criteria. 
The method as in one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that determination of the stochastic send times 

by means of random signal generator (30) is carried out 
using a basic number being characteristic for each of 

the metering units (10), respectively. 
The method in accordance with claim 8, characterized 
in that determination of the stochastic send times 

is made additionally considering a physical variable 
changing in unpredictable manner.
