<ABSTRACT>
A method for interactively selecting and displaying 
a distribution of all data fields in a selected database. 

The primary function of the methodology is to allow a user to 
view the data contained within a selected database in a 

graphical format. Additionally, the user has the capability 
of selecting specific sets of data for more detailed display 

as well as determining the effect of the selection on all 
remaining data fields which comprise the selected database. 

The first step in the process is the accessing of the 
particular database from the host system. Once the selected 

database has been accessed, a distribution matrix for each 
field in the selected database is constructed from the data 

contained within the selected database. The distribution 
matrix is then graphically displayed on any type of graphical 

display unit. From this initial graphic display, the user 
can make various selections for detailed graphical display 

and study and analyze the data structure and data content of 
the database.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a general indexing
and compression scheme for supporting graphics and data
selection, and more particularly, to a method for displaying
and selecting a distribution of all data fields in a selected
database. The method of the present invention allows a user
to choose fields in a particular database, build a
distribution of the data in the fields, graphically view the
data structure, and select specific sets of data to determine
the effect of adding or subtracting data to the selected sets
on the remaining data fields.Over the past twenty years or so, advancement in
the art of computerized information storage and retrieval has
significantly expanded man's capability for efficiently
accessing information. Todays computers with enhanced
integrated circuit technology are capable of storing
tremendous amounts of information, or to be more exact, data.
Accordingly, there is an ever increasing need for the
development of systems and processes capable of managing the
data and which permit the efficient utilization of the data.
The efficiency of computerized information storage and
retrieval systems is directly related to how efficiently the
database can be searched and how quickly records from the
database can be retrieved. There are a plurality of
systems and methods currently available which utilize various
combinations of filing schemes, indexing schemes, and data
compression schemes to enhance the efficiency of data
manipulation; however, the efficient retrieval of data is
really only the first step in the process. The display of
the data in a way that is meaningful to the system user is a
second and necessary step of the process, because no matter
how fast one can access data, if the data retrieved is
arbitrarily displayed on the screen or monitor, then the data
is meaningless to the user. In addition to displaying the 
data in a meaningful way, the system user should have the
capability of selectively displaying certain detailed aspects
of the data structure and determining the effect of adding or
deleting data to the selected sets on the remaining data
fields.The prior art references individually disclose
systems and methods for the filing, indexing, compression,
retrieval, and the display of data in a computer system;
however, there appears to be no reference disclosing a system
or method for the filling, indexing, compression, retrieval,
and display of data in one single embodiment wherein the
system user has the capability of selecting specific sets of
data to

<CLAIMS>
A method for selecting and displaying data stored in a selected database comprising a
plurality of tables, wherein a data value is stored in a data field, at least one data field

forms a data record and at least one data record is stored in a table, comprising the
steps of:


(a) accessing said selected database (100) resident on a host system and reading said
data records from selected tables to determine the structure of said data within said

selected database;
(b) building a distribution matrix (200) for each of said selected tables on the basis of
the determined structure and on the basis of a distribution algorithm varying for each

data type utilised in the selected database, each of said distribution matrices having a
matrix header and an array of data bins, whereby a data bin comprises a bin header

which contains information about the content of the bin and information about data
records from the respective table;
(c) generating a display (300) from said distribution matrices to provide a graphical
representation of the distribution of data values contained in said selected tables.
The method for selecting and displaying according to claim 1, wherein said step of
building said distribution matrices (200) further comprises the step of compressing

(240) all information contained in said distribution matrices into respective compressed
distribution records.
The method of selecting and displaying according to claim 2, wherein said step of
generating a display (300) from said plurality of distribution matrices for said selected

database further comprises the step of expanding the compressed information contained
in said compressed distribution records.
The method for selecting and displaying according to claim 2, wherein in step (c)
said display (300) is a first display having a range of data values for selected data, and

further including the step of updating every field of data values for selected data in said
first display, and thereafter generating a second display to determine the representative

effect of said updating upon the compressed distribution records.
The method of selecting and displaying according to claim 4, wherein said method
