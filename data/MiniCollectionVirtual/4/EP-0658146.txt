<ABSTRACT>
A security document is produced from a paper substrate having invisible hydrophobic toner blended into the paper. The clear toner is produced by milling (11) and classifying (12) a polyester resin, mixing it with a silica flowing agent (13), and then electrostatically imaging the toner (16) onto the paper substrate. An infrared absorbing or UV responsive dye may be added to the toner so that it is visible under infrared/ultraviolet light respectively. When applied to the paper the toner is snow white, but after infrared heat fusing (18) it blends into the paper and is substantially invisible. The security indicia is easily made visible by passing a conventional marker nib over it, or other mechanism for applying a water based low concentrate colored ink (20) which is readily absorbed by the surrounding paper, but not by the hydrophobic security indicia.

<DESCRIPTION>
There are many circumstances in which it is desirable
to print invisible indicia or areas on a paper substrate,
and then make those areas visible in a simple and easy
manner. Such a need exists in the production of
educational forms, but is particularly useful in the
security document area. Especially with the introduction
of modern color copiers, amateur and professional
counterfeiters can reproduce all sorts of valuable
documents, such as admission tickets, passes, coupons,
certificates, bank checks, lottery tickets, money orders,
and the like. Many businesses and agencies suffer
substantial losses as a result of the production and
distribution of such bogus documents, yet most cannot
justify the cost of security devices that are
conventionally available to protect against this type of
fraud.JP-A-01126659 and JP-A-01101558 each disclose a toner
incorporating a fluorescent dye or the like imaged onto a
substrate and which only becomes visible when exposed to
ultra violet light.JP-A-01142689 discloses a toner image which becomes
visible only when a transfer layer that overlays the toner
printed layer is heated to transfer its thermoplastic resin
to the toner image.US-A-5286061 discloses a ticket which has validation
data printed on it, using an ink jet printer, which data
can be developed using a developing agent. It does not
disclose a hydrophobic toner.US-A-4940690 discloses a laminated structure which
creates an image by breaking capsules with pressure and
developing an image using a chemical color changing
reaction.US-A-5139572 discloses a color forming area printed in
an ink containing a first color changing agent changeable
from invisible to visible by a color former. EP-A-090130 also discloses printing which uses an ink
which is made visible by a chemical reaction.The present invention in general terms discloses a
method and product in which essentially invisible indicia
or spots are easily applied, utilizing conventional
equipment, to a paper substrate. By using a simple
conventional highlighting marker, or the like, one can
easily test the document for authenticity, or otherwise
utilize the document, by making the hidden indicia clearly
visible. Since the invention utilizes very simple
components, conventional equipment, and simple techniques,
it can produce a security document such as a ticket, bank
check, stock certificate, coupon, or the like, at almost no
increase in cost compared to a non-protected document.The basic aspect of the present invention is the
utilization of a clear toner which

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing security indicia on a paper
substrate using a toner, comprising the steps of:


(a) charging and applying the toner in the form of
security indicia to the paper substrate;
(b) heat fusing the toner so that it blends into the
paper and becomes substantially invisible to the naked

eye and color copiers when illuminated with ambient
light characterised in that the toner is hydrophobic

and heat fused into the substrate such that the
surface of the substrate part incorporating the toner

is not absorptive to an aqueous based solvent while the
remainder of the substrate is absorptive to an aqueous

based solvent.
A method as recited in claim 1 characterised in that
step (a) is practised by electrostatic imaging.
A method as recited in claim 1 or claim 2
