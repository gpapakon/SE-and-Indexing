<ABSTRACT>
Genes encoding opioid receptors can be retrieved from vertebrate libraries using the murine probe disclosed herein under low-stringency conditions. The DNA sequence shown in Figure 5 or its complement can be used to obtain the human delta, kappa and mu genes as well as the murine mu gene. The probe provided encodes the murine delta opioid receptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to substances involved
in vertebrate nervous systems, and in particular to the
opioid receptors and activities mediated thereby.
Accordingly, the invention concerns recombinant
materials useful for the production of opioid
receptors
and methods of using the receptor to screen
for drugs that modulate the activity of the receptor.The term "opioid" generically refers to all
drugs, natural and synthetic, that have morphine-like
actions. Formerly, the term "opiate" was used to
designate drugs derived from opium, e.g., morphine,
codeine, and many semi-synthetic congeners of morphine.
After the isolation of peptide compounds with morphine-like
actions, the term opioid was introduced to refer
generically to all drugs with morphine-like actions.
Included among opioids are various peptides that
exhibit morphine-like activity, such as endorphins,
enkephalins and dynorphins. However, some sources have
continued to use the term "opiate" in a generic sense,
and in such contexts, opiate and opioid are
interchangeable. Additionally, the term opioid has
been used to refer to antagonists of morphine-like
drugs as well as to characterize receptors or binding
sites that combine with such agents. Opioids are generally employed as analgesics,
but they may have many other pharmacological effects as
well. Morphine and related opioids produce their major
effects on the central nervous and digestive systems.
The effects are diverse, including analgesia,
drowsiness, mood changes, respiratory depression,
dizziness, mental clouding, dysphoria, pruritus,
increased pressure in the biliary tract, decreased
gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, and
alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous
systems.A significant feature of the analgesia
produced by opioids is that it occurs without loss of
consciousness. When therapeutic doses of morphine are
given to patients with pain, they report that the pain
is less intense, less discomforting, or entirely gone.
In addition to experiencing relief of distress, some
patients experience euphoria. However, when morphine
in a selected pain-relieving dose is given to a pain-free
individual, the experience is not always pleasant;
nausea is common, and vomiting may also occur.
Drowsiness, inability to concentrate, difficulty in
mentation, apathy, lessened physical activity, reduced
visual acuity, and lethargy may ensue.The development of tolerance and physical
dependence with repeated use is a characteristic
feature of all opioid drugs, and the possibility of
developing
