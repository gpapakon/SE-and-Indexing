<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a digital data signal intended particularly to be received by AM/VSB demodulator receivers. The signal of the invention comprises a pilot frequency fp (41), an unused frequency band fp to fp + P. DELTA f (42) carrying no useful signal and a plurality of carrier frequencies fp + P. DELTA f to fp + Q. DELTA f (43), each of the said carrier frequencies being modulated by separate data elements representative of a source digital signal to be transmitted. The plurality of carrier frequencies forms, for example, a COFDM signal. The pilot frequency (41) makes it possible to carry out demodulation of the plurality of carriers (43) by use of a conventional AM/VSB demodulator. The unused band (42) allows correct operation of the carrier-recovery circuits of the receivers.
