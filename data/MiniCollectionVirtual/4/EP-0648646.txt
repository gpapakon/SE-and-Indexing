<ABSTRACT>
A passenger side air bag deployment opening (18) is formed by 
interfit unequal triangular door substrate panels. 

In a first embodiment four triangular 
door substrate panels (20,22,24,26) fit into an asymmetric 

quadrangular deployment opening in the instrument panel (14) and are 
able to be hinged open by the inflating air bag. In a second 

embodiment three triangular door 
substrate panels form a triangular 

deployment opening. The door patterns of each embodiment allow the 
door substrate panels to avoid damage to the windshield (16) and injury 

to a passenger when forced open.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns air bag safety systems and more 
particularly, air bag installations utilizing one or more 
deployment door panels fit into an opening formed in an interior 
trim piece of an automobile passenger compartment. The door panels 
when hinged open enable the air bag to be deployed into the 
passenger compartment upon inflation from a storage container 
located behind the interior trim piece. Air bag safety systems comprise one or more air bags each of 
which stored in a folded condition within an air bag canister. 
These systems include means for rapidly inflating the air bag upon 
sensing the beginning of a relatively severe collision. The 
inflated air bag is intended to cushion the driver or passenger to 
prevent injury as the vehicle is rapidly decelerated as a result of 
the collision. Currently, a driver's side air bag is stored in a location 
within the steering wheel, while the front passengers are intended 
to be protected by an air bag stowed behind the instrument panel. 
Additional air bag locations are currently under consideration. The present invention concerns particular problems associated 
with the front passenger air bag installations. Since the stored 
air bag is stored behind a trim piece, i.e., the instrument panel, 
an opening must be formed in the trim piece in order to allow the 
air bag to exit from its storage location and into the passenger 
compartment upon inflation. This is done by opening of the hinged door panels described 
above which swing open as the air bag is inflated, typically by the 
air bag itself pushing the door panels out of the way. The 
construction of the deployment doors is important inasmuch as they 
should provide secure protection against tampering and yet allow 
instantaneous opening upon the occurrence of a crash event. Since the door panels are fit within the trim structure in a 
highly visible location, i.e., in the steering wheel cover or the 
instrument panel, in the case of the driver's side and the  
 
passenger's side air bags respectively, styling is important. Such 
considerations have led to the so-called invisible seam type 
installation, in which the deployment door panels are covered with 
a smooth expanse of the trim piece outer layer and cannot be 
detected visually. Various door patterns have been employed including, in the 
case of a double door, an "H" pattern in which two doors are hinged 
respectively at the top and bottom region of the trim piece and 
hinged along horizontal axes. An X pattern has also been

activation of said air bag system; 

   said air bag deployment construction formed by a plurality of 
generally triangular door substrate panels each hinged along one 

side of said triangular shape to said trim structure, said door 
substrate panels interfit together with the remaining sides of each 

of said triangular door substrate panels contiguous with next 

adjacent door substrate panels to close off said deployment opening 
when said door substrate panels are hinged to a closed position, 

said generally triangular door substrate panels not all of the same 
size and arranged in an asymmetrical pattern. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 1 wherein said passenger compartment has an instrument panel 

located at a forward side of said passenger compartment extending 
transversely to the longitudinal axis of said vehicle, said 

instrument panel comprising said interior trim structure formed 
with said deployment opening. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 2 wherein four of said vehicle said door substrate panels are 

included, forming a quadrangle when in said closed position. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 2 wherein three of said door substrate panels are included, 

forming a triangle when in said closed position. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 3 wherein said four door substrate panels interfit to form a 

quadrangle when in said closed condition, and are arranged so that 
said quadrangle extends generally along said instrument panel. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 5 wherein right and left triangular door substrate panels 

each have a hinging side of said triangular shape which define 
 

either side of said quadrangle, said left door section 
substantially larger than said right door section. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 6 wherein a forward and rear triangular door substrate panels 

are positioned between the hinging sides of said right and left 
triangular door substrate panels, said hinging side of said rear 

door section skewed with respect to said instrument panel by having 
the left end thereof forward of the right end. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 6 wherein the base hinging side of said right door section is 

skewed by having the forward end thereof to the left of said rear 
end thereof. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 4 wherein an apex of said triangular deployment opening is on 

the right side of said instrument panel, with a base side of said 
triangle extending generally in the direction of the longitudinal 

axis of said vehicle to open to the left, said door substrate 
panels each having a vertex meeting the vertex of the other door 

substrate panels. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
claim 9 wherein said two other triangular door substrate panels 

have their hinging sides extending along said instrument panel to 
open forwardly and rearwardly respectively. 
The air bag deployment door construction according to 
any one of claims 2 to 10 wherein said deployment opening and door 

substrate panels are overlain with a smooth covering layer to be 
invisible from within said passenger compartment.
