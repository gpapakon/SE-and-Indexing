<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure the amplitude and the phase of the reflection coefficient of a structure (S) such as a protective radome of a radar, in particular after repair, a measuring device is proposed, a portable part (10) of which makes it possible to convert the microwave measurement and reference signals into low-frequency signals. These low-frequency signals are then transferred via flexible cables (16,17) to a computation part (12,14), without it being possible for phase distortions to be created by torsion of the cable. The signals are converted by providing the portable part, in addition to the main microwave generator (18), with a second microwave generator (32), the frequency (f2) of which differs from that (f1) of the main generator by a given low frequency (f0). Microwave mixers (38,42) use the radiation emitted by the second generator (32) in order to give the measurement signal and the reference signal, initially at frequency (f1), the low frequency (f0).
