characterized in that
 the spring (60) takes the form of a 
tension spring which is clamped between the hinged wall 

(40) and an undercarriage-fixed point, preferably a mast 
support block (48), and exerts a torque directed in the 

direction of the operating position upon the hinged wall. 
Automobile concrete pump according to one of claims 1 to 
5, 
characterized by
 a detent device (64, 70) which is 
disposed 
between the hinged wall (40) and an 
undercarriage-fixed part, preferably a mast support block  

 
(48), and is automatically latchable into position in the 

operating position of the hinged wall (40). 
Automobile concrete pump according to claim 6, 

characterized in that
 the detent device (64, 70) is 
automatically releasable under the action of the 

distributor mast (18) swivelling in the direction of the 
supporting point (48). 
Automobile concrete pump according to claim 6 or 7, 

characterized in that
 the hinged wall (40) after release 
of the detent connection (64, 70) may be swivelled, 

preferably under the action of the distributor mast (18) 
swivelling in the direction of the supporting point (48), 

out of its operating position in the direction of its 
travel position. 
Automobile concrete pump according to one of claims 6 
to 8, 
characterized in that
 the detent device comprises a 
fixed detent element (70) preferably disposed on the 

undercarriage-fixed part and a detent element (64), which 
is preferably disposed on the hinged wall (40), is 

automatically latchable by means of a leading bevel (66) 
onto the fixed detent element (70) and is capable of 

swivelling to a limited extent about a horizontal axis. 
Automobile concrete pump according to claim 9,
