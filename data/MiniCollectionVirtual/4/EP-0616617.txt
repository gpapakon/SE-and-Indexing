<DESCRIPTION>
Photoinitiators having a fluoroalkyl moiety are useful 
for photopolymerizing and photocuring fluorinated monomers, 
especially fluorinated acrylic monomers. Cure of polymer coatings by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) 
or other radiation offers the advantages of speed, cost 
efectiveness and avoidance of the need for solvents. Photocuring coating compositions are usually comprised 
of three components: the monomer, a photoinitiator, and 
(optionally) additives. Acrylic coatings based on fluoroalkyl acrylic ester 
monomers (herein sometimes referred to as "F-acrylates") 
possess highly desirable properties such as high thermal and 
chemical stability, low surface energy, low friction, and low 
refractive index. Photoinitiators conventionally employed for 
polymerizing the usual acrylic monomers are not miscible with 
some highly fluorinated acrylate monomers, and there are no 
ready means for photocuring such acrylate monomers. UV curing 
of such fluorinated acrylate monomers without the aid of a 
photoinitiator, while feasible, gives less than optimum 
properties, is time consuming and expensive. This invention provides a method of polymerizing and curing 
fluorinated acrylic monomers of the formula (A) or (B) set out below, 
using certain fluorine-containing photoinitiators which are 
compatible with highly fluorinated acrylate monomers.  
 Fluorinated photoinitiators used according to the invention have 
the formula (I) 
 
wherein at least one of the R1 through R4 groups is a 
terminally fluorinated group of the formula 
-W-(X)q-Y-Rf 
   wherein 
W and Yare independently selected groups of the 
formula 
-(CH2)p--(CH2CH2O)p--[CH2CH(OH)CH2O]p- 
wherein p is an integer of from 1 to 10, 
and 
-Ar-, 
wherein Ar is 
Xis -O-, -OC(O)-, -C(O)O- or -C(O)-; qis zero or 1, provided that when q is zero, 
then W and Y may not both be present together; 
and Rfis selected from the group consisting of 
-(CF2)nZ-CF(CF3)[OCF2CF(CF3)]nZ and-CF2-(OCF2CF2)n-(OCF2)mZ 
wherein 
m and nare integers of from 1 to 40,  
 
provided that in -CF2-(OCF2CF2)n-(OCF2)mZ, 
one of m and n, but not both, may be 0, 
and Zis H or F;  
wherein the remaining R1 through R4 groups, if any, are 
independently selected from the group consisting of 
H, -OH, R, -OR, -NR2 
and 
 
   wherein R is alkyl, straight chain, branched or 
cyclic, having from 1 to 20 carbons; phenyl, 
biphenyl or naphthyl;
