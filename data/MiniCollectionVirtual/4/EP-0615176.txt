<ABSTRACT>
In a scavengeless development apparatus, an electrode wire (42) is disposed between 
a donor roll (40) and a latent image to form a powder cloud of toner to develop the latent 

image. A magnet (100) is disposed along the electrode wire, and low-frequency AC is passed 
through the electrode wire. The electromagnetic forces acting on the wire from the 

interaction of the AC with the magnetic field are adapted substantially to cancel mechanical 
vibration of the electrode wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to developer apparatus for electrophotographic 
printing. An important variation to the general principle of image development in 
electrophotographic printing is the concept of "scavengeless" development. The purpose and 
function of scavengeless development are described more fully in, for example, US-A 
4,868,600. In a scavengeless development system, toner is made available to the photoreceptor 
by means of AC electric fields supplied by self-spaced electrode structures, commonly in the 
form of wires extending across the photoreceptor, positioned within the nip between a donor 
roll and photoreceptor. Because there is no physical contact between the development 
apparatus and the photoreceptor, scavengeless development is useful for devices in which 
different types of toner are supplied onto the same photoreceptor, as in "tri-level" or 
"recharge, expose, and develop" highlight or image-on-image color xerography. A typical "hybrid" scavengeless development apparatus includes, within a developer 
housing, a transport roll, a donor roll, and an electrode structure. The transport roll operates in 
a manner similar to a developer roll, but instead of conveying toner directly to the 
photoreceptor, conveys toner to a donor roll disposed between the transport roll and the 
photoreceptor. The transport roll is electrically biased relative to the donor roll, so that the 
toner particles are attracted from the transport roll to the donor roll. The donor roll further 
conveys toner particles from the transport roll toward the photoreceptor. In the nip between 
the donor roll and the photoreceptor are the wires forming the electrode structure. During 
development of the latent image on the photoreceptor, the electrode wires are AC-biased 
relative to the donor roll to detach toner therefrom so as to form a toner powder cloud in the 
gap between the donor roll and the photoreceptor. The latent image on the photoreceptor 
attracts toner particles from the powder cloud, forming a toner powder image thereon. Another variation on scavengeless development is single-component scavengeless 
development, also known as scavengeless SCD. In scavengeless SCD, the donor roll and the 
electrode structure create a toner powder cloud in the same manner as the above-described 
scavengeless development, but instead of using a magnetic brush to convey toner particles 
from the toner supply in the developer housing to the donor roll, a portion of the donor roll is 
exposed directly to a supply of
