<ABSTRACT>
The present invention involves an inductively 
activated silicon switch (TRIAC, SCR) for a 

control and protection circuit for motors and 
compressors. The circuit includes a logic gate 

(G1) for combining both motor control and 
protection functions. The logic gate has inputs 

from a thermostat (7), a compressor shell 
temperature circuit (21), a fan overheat detection 

circuit (28), a motor start relay circuit (29), 
and motor load sensing circuits (24, 25, 26). The 

logic gate output is connected to an oscillator 
(30) for inductively activating the power output 

stage (31), as well as a compressor shell 

temperature hysteresis circuit (22), and a fan 
timer circuit connected to the fan control circuit 

(27). The control circuitry further includes an 
over-ride circuit (23) for manually allowing a 

limited number of immediate restart attempts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to control and
protection circuitry for refrigeration systems.
More particularly, the field of the invention
involves circuitry for activating and deactivating
a compressor and a fan motor.Motor protection devices generally include
electro-mechanical or solid state electronic
devices for protection and control of motors or
compressors. Conventional motor protection
devices seek to regulate the current drawn by the
compressor motor under various loads and
conditions. By limiting the amount of current
provided to the compressor motor, conventional
motor protection devices protect the compressor's
windings from damaging effects of high currents
and high temperatures.For example, one conventional motor
protection device is a snap disc placed in series
with the windings of the compressor motor. The
snap disc is composed of bi-metallic layers which
are in physical contact with the contact points
which close the circuit. Typically, a resistive
heating element which heats the bi-metallic layers
is connected in series with contact points such
that when the heat generated by compressor current
passing through the resistive element exceeds the
allowable threshold, the different metals of the
bi-metallic layer expand at different rates,
causing the disc to bend. This bending of the
disc breaks the connection to the contact points,
thereby opening the circuit to the compressor
motor. Another arrangement involves placing the
snap disc device in close proximity to the
compressor motor so that the snap disc device may 
open and close in response to the temperature of
the compressor motor.Several problems may occur with a
conventional snap action bi-metallic motor
overload protector. One problem with the snap
disc device is that the overload condition may be
detected only after a significant amount of time
has passed since the condition originally
developed. During this lag time, significant
damage to the windings of the motor can occur.
Also, conventional snap disc overload protection
devices are generally imprecise and non-dynamic.
For instance, the temperature and current set
points of a snap disc cannot account for different
environmental or motor loading conditions.
Finally, once the snap disc has opened the circuit
to the motor windings, the restoration period of
the bi-metallic device is typically excessively
lengthy.Additional motor protection devices include
solid state electronic devices which control the
power delivered to the compressor motor. In
contrast with the
