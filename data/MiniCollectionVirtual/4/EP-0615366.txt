<ABSTRACT>
The message to be transmitted consists of one or more 
transmission words which each consist of, in the sequence 

of transmission, a start section, a data word of a certain 
number of bits and a stop section. At rest, the link is in 

a first state. During transmission of the start section, 
the link is set to a second state, and during transmission 

of the stop section the transmission is set to the first 
state. For each bit of the data word, the link is set, 

depending on the logical level of the bit, to the first 
state or the second state. Each station monitors the state 

of the link and refrains from transmission if the station 
detects an occupied state as a result of a transmission by 

another station of the link.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for safeguarding 
the integrity of data in the case of asynchronous 
transmission over a link which is common to more than two 
transmitting/receiving stations, a message to be transmitting 
consisting of one or more transmission words which 
each consist of, in the sequence of transmission, a start 
section, a data word of a certain number of bits, and a 
stop section, the link at rest being in a first state, 
during transmission of the start section the link being in 
a second state, during transmission of the stop section the 
link being in the first state, and for each bit of the data 
word the link being set, depending on the logical level of 
the bit, to the first state or the second state. A method of the abovementioned type is known in 
practice. The two states of the link can be represented, 
for example, by two different voltage levels or two 
different audio frequencies. The lengths of the start 
section and of the stop section are equal, for example, to 
the duration of the transmission of one bit. The RS485 bus, 
for example, is such a link where the two states are 
different voltage levels of the link. The known method has the drawback that without 
special measures collision may take place on the link, that 
is to say that two or more transmitting/receiving stations 
may transmit simultaneously, which in general results in 
corruption of the transmission words sent, owing to which 
these cannot be received correctly, resulting in 
communication from each of the transmitting stations 
failing. In the known method, the special measures taken 
consist, for example, of the use of a master station, the 
other stations being slave stations and the master station 
interrogating the slave stations in turn whether they wish 
to transmit. If a polled slave station wishes to transmit, 
said slave station reports this to the master station,  
 
whereupon said slave station may engage the link for 
transmission of data to another station. The time during 
which the slave station may occupy the link for a 
transmission to another station may be a predetermined 
fixed time or a variable time which has to be stated in 
advance and depends on the length of the message to be 
transmitted. After said time has elapsed, the master 
station may continue with the cyclic polling of the slave 
stations. The special measures to be taken with the known 
method may also consist of granting in turn to the stations 
permission for transmission, where said permission may 
consist of a

Method for safeguarding the integrity of data in 
the case of asynchronous transmission over a link which is 

common to more than two transmitting/receiving stations, a 
message to be transmitted consisting of one or more 

transmission words which each consist of, in the sequence 
of transmission, a start section, a data word of a certain 

number of bits, and a stop section, the link at rest being 
in a first state, during transmission of the start section 

the link being in a second state, during transmission of 
the stop section the link being in the first state, and for 

each bit of the data word the link being set, depending on 
the logical level of the bit, to the first state or the 

second state, characterized in that each station monitors 
the state of the link and refrains from transmitting if the 

station detects an occupied state of the link as a result 
of a transmission by another station and the station is not 

authorized to perform a response transmission. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that, 
if a station finds that the link is in the second state, it 

starts, for itself, an interval of occupation of a longer 
duration than the transmission duration of a transmission 

word, or restarts if the interval of occupation is already 

running, and the current interval of occupation indicates 
the occupied state. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that 
a restart of the interval of occupation is inhibited during 

a start inhibit interval, the duration of the start inhibit 
interval is longer than the transmission duration of a 

transmission word minus a stop section, the duration of the 
start inhibit interval is shorter than the transmission 

duration of a transmission word plus a start section, and 
the start inhibit interval commences at the same time as 

the starting or restarting of the interval of occupation. 
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that 
there is assigned to each station a unique address, a first 

station which commences a communication with a second 
station, incorporates the address of the second station as 

a destination address in a first message, the second 
 

station is authorized to perform a transmission in a 
reaction interval which follows the transmission by the 

first station of the first message, the reaction interval 
terminating, at the latest, with the termination of the 

interval of occupation, and the first station deciding that 
the communication has taken place correctly if the first 

station receives back a valid second message which 
commences within the reaction interval. 
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that 
a transmitting station determines for itself the interval 

of occupation and the reaction interval of this station 
terminates at the latest at the end of said interval of 

occupation. 
Method according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that if the first station, subsequent to the transmission 

of the first message commencing within the reaction 
interval does not receive a valid second message, the first 

station repeats the transmission of the first message after 
a delay interval following the reaction interval has 

elapsed, said delay interval having a high probability of 
being different for different stations. 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the first station, prior to each occurrence of the delay 

interval, defines a random duration of the delay interval. 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the delay interval is a function of the address of the 

first station. 
Method according to any one of claims 4 to 8 
inclusive, characterized in that each message contains the 

address of the transmitting station, the second message 
contains a destination address, and the first station, upon 

receiving a second message destined for the first station, 
decides that the communication has taken place correctly if 

it finds that the destination address of the first message 
is identical with the sender address of the second message. 
Communication system containing a number of 
transmitting/receiving stations which are linked by means 

of a common link which is suitable for asynchronous 
transmission of messages between the stations, the system 

 
being suitable for use of a method according to any one of 

the preceding claims.
