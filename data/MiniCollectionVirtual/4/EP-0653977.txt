<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus for manufacturing 
a truss, a press head for use therein and a method of 
connecting timber members together. Until recently, roof trusses have exclusively been 
manufactured manually. However, over the years, various 
developments have been made which have assisted in the 
manufacturing process. For example, machines having a 
plurality of press heads each having an integral platen 
have been developed wherein the press heads and platens 
are manually positioned at the joints of the truss and 
locked in position. The members forming the truss are 
positioned on the platens and all of the press heads are 
then operated simultaneously and from a central control 
to press connectors into the joints to form a self 
supporting structure. Another type of known jig 
consists of separate platens and press heads wherein the 
platens are first laid out at their required joint 
locations (often they are strung together to form long 
continuous sections for ease), and suspended or floor 
mounted press heads are then individually moved into 
position at each joint and operated. A further type of 
known jig consists of a solid roller used to press 
connector plates into the joints. The plates are  
 
loosely fixed at the joints by hammering and then the 
entire truss assembly is fed into the roller mechanism 
which acts rather like a mangle to press the connectors 
into the joints and fix the truss members together. It is also known to provide a large truss table 
whereon stops are manually located at required 
positions, continuous platens are laid at and between 
all joints and then a travelling beam press traverses 
the truss stopping at each joint under manual control 
and presses the joints together. US patent No. 4943038 
discloses a similar truss assembly table having a 
plurality of sections in each of which a plurality of 
jig stops is provided which can be positioned to enable 
the truss members to be accurately positioned with 
respect to one another on the table prior to 
connection. The jig stops are each positioned by means 
of a lead screw driven by a manually operated drill. 
However, although each jig stop is positioned by a 
power-operated device, these devices are manually 
operated and each jig stop therefore requires individual 
attention. There has been some attempt to automate the 
manufacture of trusses and US Patent No. 3599562 
discloses one such attempt. In the disclosed device, a 
plurality of power-actuated press devices are adjustably 
supported for

Apparatus for manufacturing a truss, comprising a 
plurality of press heads (8) arranged in a single plane 

about a fixed datum point (12) and movable within the 
plane about the datum point (12), wherein the press 

heads (8) are each connected to powered driving means 
and to control means for controlling the powered driving 

means and for automatically determining the desired 
position of each head (8) with respect to the datum 

point (12) such that each head (8) can be automatically
