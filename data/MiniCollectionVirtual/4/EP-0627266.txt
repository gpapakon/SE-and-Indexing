<ABSTRACT>
A nebuliser for atomising a substance into a stream of 
gas including a casing and nozzle head (103). The nozzle head (103) 

has at least one gas outlet (113) and a reservoir (114) disposed around 
said at least one gas outlet (113) for receiving the substance 

and from which the substance is atomised by the stream of 
gas. The nebuliser also includes means for introducing 

substance to the atomiser into the nebuliser, at least two 
holes opening into the reservoir and an airflow control 

device. The at least two holes opening (110) into the reservoir (114) 
through which the substance to be atomised is drawn by the 

stream of gas issuing from said at least one gas outlet (113). 
Airflow control device has a bridge bar (105) which is located 

for interception of the gas issuing from said at least one 
gas outlet (113) so as to be freely angularly displaceable for 

deflecting the stream of gas issuing from said at least one 
gas outlet (113) across the reservoir (114).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to atomizers and nozzles for atomizers used for atomising fluids or powders carried in a stream of pressurised gas. A nebulizer having the features of the preamble of claim 1 is known from GB-A-838 453. The invention is particularly useful for introducing a medicament in the form of a medicinal fluid or powder into gas for inhalation by a patient, thereby administering a medicine to the patient. The substance may typically be a powder, a liquid or a particulate suspension. German Patent Specification DE 34 29 411 describes a nozzle for atomising, distributing and mixing fluid or powdery substances by means of a stream of gas and, in particular for producing aerosols for the purposes of inhalation. More specifically claim 1 of DE 34 29 411 claims such as a nozzle consisting of a nozzle body and an airstream control device which can be mounted on the nozzle body, wherein the stream of pressurised gas emerging centrally from the head of the nozzle through a pressurised gas duct draws in the material to be atomised from two intake ducts which are adjacent the pressurized gas ducts and are diametrically opposite one another, and wherein the airstream control device comprises a rebound bar in the outlet cone of the pressurized gas which bar is connected to a ring which can be mounted on the head of the nozzle body and is characterized in that the rebound bar (11) is shaped as a wedge in a manner known per se on its side opposite the nozzle opening (29);
in that two parallel guide surfaces (15) are provided on the ring (14) and corresponding guide surfaces (17) which are adapted to the first guide surfaces and are aligned therewith are provided on the nozzle head (16) in such a way that, when the airstream control device is mounted, the rebound bar (11) extends transversely to the connection line between the outlet openings (30, 31) of the intake ducts (5, 6); andthat the outer contour of the ring (14) of the airstream control, device (3) projects over the edge of the nozzle head (16) on all sides.For reference, copies of Figures 1, 2 and 3 of DE 3429411 are appended to this specification indicating those components mentioned above and bearing reference numbers (11), (29), (15), (14), (17), (16), (30, (31), (5), (6) and (3).
Accurate alignment of the rebound bar is vital to the correct function of such a conventional atomizer as described in DE 34 29 411.There are several disadvantages to the atomizers that have been used hitherto. The atomizers are often used by elderly or infirm
