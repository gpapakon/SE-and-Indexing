<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the manufacture of methyl mercaptan (methanethiol) by catalytic hydrogenation of dimethyl disulphide over a catalyst based on sulphide(s) of at least one transition metal. By carrying out the reaction in the presence of water and/or of hydrogen sulphide, the selectivity towards methyl mercaptan is considerably improved.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the selective preparation of methyl
mercaptan by catalytic hydrogenation of dimethyl

disulphide (DMDS) on a catalyst supported on an inorganic
support and based on sulphide(s) of at least one

transition metal, characterized in that the process is
performed in the presence of water and/or hydrogen

sulphide, and in that the H
2
/DMDS molar ratio is between
0.5 and 10.
Process according to Claim 1, in which the
proportion of water or of hydrogen sulphide ranges from

0.01 to 50 % by weight relative to the dimethyl
disulphide, and is preferably between 0.1 and 15 %.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the H
2
/DMDS molar ratio is between 0.8 and 4.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which the process is performed at a temperature ranging

from 50 to 400°C, preferably between 100 and 250°C.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in
which the process is performed at atmospheric pressure or

at a greater pressure which may range up to 50 bar.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in
which the catalyst is based on sulphide(s) of nickel,

cobalt, molybdenum and/or tungsten.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in
which the catalyst consists of nickel and molybdenum

sulphides on an alumina support.
