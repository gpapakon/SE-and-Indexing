<ABSTRACT>
In this method, polymers with carboxyl, amino and/or phenolic-hydroxy groups are reacted with delta-2-oxazolines substituted in the 2-position by a phenyl group or by a long-chain alkyl or alkenyl group with 7 to 23 C-atoms. The reaction goes rapidly and leads to an improvement in the stability of polyesters and polyamides to hydrolysis. The use of the corresponding bis-oxazolines gives, in addition, an increase in the molecular weight.

<CLAIMS>
A process for modifying polymers containing carboxyl, amino and/or 
phenolic hydroxyl groups by reaction with delta
2
-oxazolines, characterized in 
that mono- or bis-oxazolines substituted in the 2-position by a long-chain, 

optionally substituted alkyl or alkenyl radical containing 11 to 23 carbon 
atoms in a linear chain are used as the delta
2
-oxazolines. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which waste plastics are used as 
the polymers and bis-oxazolines are used as the delta
2
-oxazolines. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which polyesters, preferably 
polyethylene terephthalate and/or polybutylene terephthalate, are used as the 

polymers. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which polyamides, preferably 
polyamide 6 or polyamide 6,6, are used as the polymers. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which aromatic polyamides, 
preferably polyamides obtainable from aromatic diamines and aromatic 

dicarboxylic acids, are used as the polymers. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, in which mono-oxazolines bearing the 
alkyl/alkenyl group of ricinoleic acid, oleic acid or the soybean oil fatty acid 

mixture in the 2-position are used as the delta
2
-oxazolines.
