<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous aerosol lacquer for holding and/or fixing hair. This lacquer contains, dissolved in water and as film-forming substance, a copolymer essentially consisting of repeating units derived from the polymerisation:   (i) of at least one unsaturated sulphonic acid in a proportion of 30 to 90% by weight and having the following general formula: 
<

  in which:     R1 represents a hydrogen atom or the CH3 radical,   X represents -O- or -NH-, and Y represents a linear or branched alkylene chain having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and   (ii) of at least one N-monoalkylacrylamide or methacrylamide in a proportion of 10 to 70% by weight and having the following general formula:
