<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a new process for the preparation of 3-(3-carboxypropyl)-5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (I), characterised in that 6-carbethoxy-6-p-methoxyphenylhydrazonohexanoic acid (II) and a carboxylic acid having 1-3 C atoms are subjected to a cyclisation reaction, the resulting mixture of I, the two monoethyl esters of I and the diethyl esters of I are treated with a strong inorganic base, and the resulting salt is treated with a strong acid to convert it into the free acid I.

Process for the preparation of 3-(3-carboxy-propyl)-5-methoxyindole-2-cabroxylic 
acid (I), characterized in that 6-carboethoxy-6-p-methoxyphenylhydrazono-hexanoic 

acid (II) is cyclized using a carboxylic 
acid which contains 1-3 carbon atoms, the resulting mixture comprising I, 

the two I monoethyl esters and I diethyl ester is treated with a strong 
inorganic base, and the resulting salt is converted into the free acid I by 

treatment with a stron acid.
