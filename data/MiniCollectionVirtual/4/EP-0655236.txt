<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a meltable composition comprising, in an aqueous medium, at least one quaternary ammonium salt containing at least one ester function, and at least one fat which is liquid at a temperature not exceeding 40 DEG C, the fat and the concentrations of ammonium salt and of fat being chosen so that the composition has a viscosity equal to at least 0.6 Pa.s when undisturbed and before use. This composition is intended, in particular, for hair care and/or treatment.
