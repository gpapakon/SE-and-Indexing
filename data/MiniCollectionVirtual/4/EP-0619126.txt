<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle exercising stand is disclosed. A frame (1) 
includes positioning sockets (9, 12) for engaging an axle (Ra) 

of hub (H) and positioning a drive wheel (B) of a bicycle, and 
holding mechanism arranged substantially opposite to the 

positioning sockets (9, 12) which are movable between extended 
and contracted positions wherein the holding mechanism is 

arranged to engage the other hub (H) of the bicycle in the 
extended position to cooperate with the positioning sockets 

(9, 12) to rotatably hold the drive wheel (B) which is lift 
off of the floor. A pedal (26) is mounted to a lower portion 

of the frame (1) and coupled to the holding mechanism for 
moving the holding mechanism between the extended and 

contracted positions by operating the pedal (26) by foot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a bicycle 
exercise stand. More particularly, it relates to an exercise 
stand which lifts the drive wheel of the bicycle off of the 
floor and holds the wheel, and permits a user to perform 
pedaling exercise while a resistance applying device applies 
a drag force to the drive wheel. Bicycles have long been used as indoor training devices 
over decades. Such training generally requires a stand which 
lifts a drive wheel (rear wheel) of the bicycle off of the 
floor and a resistance device which applies a drag force to 
the drive wheel. Representative prior art stands are 
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,768,782 and 4,969,642. These 
stands each includes a frame constructed with a pair of front 
and rear pipes and having at least a pair of upward extending 
support legs. The legs in turn carry substantially 
horizontally extending longitudinally aligned support arms 
having facing sockets on their facing ends. The sockets are 
arranged to engage the hubs of the bicycle's wheel in a manner 
that lifts the wheel slightly off of the floor or ground. The 
outer periphery of the drive wheel's tire is also placed in 
frictional contact with a resistance applying device that is 
mounted on the frame. With this arrangement, the user may  
 
perform a stationary pedaling exercise by riding the bike in 
a normal manner.
 
In the stand disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,768 782, the 
support arms take the form of opposing threaded bolts. Thus 
to mount the bicycle on the stand, the user must lift the rear 
wheel to a position where the bicycle hubs correspond in 
height to the height of the support arms. The sockets are 
then positioned over the hubs by rotating knobs on the outer 
ends of the bolts. Thus, the user must hold the upper rear 
portion of the bicycle with one hand while at the same time, 
rotating one of the bolts to properly mount the bicycle. 
Although knobs on the end of the bolts make them easier to 
rotate, it requires a fair amount of dexterity to 
simultaneously hold the bicycle in position and turn the knob. 
Accordingly, the actions required to set the bicycle on the 
stand are somewhat difficult. The stand disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,969,642 is quite 
similar to the stand described above. In effect it simply 
replaces one of the threaded bolts with a hand lever actuated 
cam and piston arrangement. That is, one of the support arms 
has a lever mounted thereon. The lever has a cam surface that 
drives a piston laterally to position the second socket.

<CLAIMS>
In an exercise stand for supporting the drive wheel of 
bicycle wheel to facilitate using the bicycle for stationary 

exercise, the exercise stand having a frame (1), positioning 
means (9, 12) provided on the frame (1) for supporting a first 

hub of a drive wheel (B) of the bicycle to position the drive 
wheel (B), and holding means (15, 16, 17) positioned 

substantially opposite to said positioning means (9, 12) for 
supporting a second hub of the drive wheel (B), wherein the 

drive wheel (B) being rotatably held, the improvement 
characterized by: 

   said holding means (15, 16, 17) being arranged to be 
rotatable between a first and a second positions, wherein the 

holding means (15, 16, 17) is aligned against the positioning 
means (9, 12) in the first position, and the holding means 

(15, 16, 17) is offsetted against the positioning means (9, 
12) in the second position; 

   pedal means (26) mounted to the frame (1) for moving the 
holding means (15, 16, 17). 
A bicycle exercise stand as set forth in claim 1, wherein 
said pedal means includes a pedal (26) which is mounted on the 

lower part of the holding means (15, 16, 17). 
A bicycle exercise stand as set forth in claim 2, further 
including a motion converting mechanism (19, 21 25) for 

 
linking the pedal (26) to the holding means (15, 16, 17) and 

converting operation of said pedal (26) into a horizontal 
motion of the holding means (15, 16, 17). 
A bicycle exercise stand as set forth in claim 3, wherein 
motion converting means includes: 

   a rod (25) a first end of which is linked to said pedal 
(26) to extend upward, said rod (25) being moved substantially 

vertically according to the pedal operation of the pedal (26); 

   first linkage means (19) for linking a second end of the 
rod (25) and end of the holding means (15, 16, 17); 

   second linkage means (21) for linking the second end of 
the rod (25)and end of the frame (1); and 

   said first and second linkage means (19) (21) converting 
the substantially vertical movement of the rod (25) into a 

rotational movement to transmit to the holding means (15, 16, 
17). 
A bicycle exercise stand as set forth in anyone of claims 
1 through 4, wherein said holding means further includes: 

   a supporting arm (15) rotatably coupled to the frame (1);
