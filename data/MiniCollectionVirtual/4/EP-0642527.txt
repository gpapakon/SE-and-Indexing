formula I 


 
wherein 


R¹ denotes a hydroxyl or amino group or an acylated or 
alkylated or polyoxyethylene-substituted amino group, 

the acyl or alkyl group of which is straight-chained or 
branched, has 1 to 24 carbon atoms and up to 2 double 

bonds and may be substituted by an aromatic group; 
R² denotes H, F, a 2-bromovinyl group or a straight-chained 
or branched C₁₋₂₄-alkyl group; 
R³ and R⁴ are identical or different and denote H, 
hydroxyl, halogen and azido; 
R⁵ denotes a nucleoside group of formula II 

 
wherein 


R⁶ denotes a hydroxyl or amino group or an acylated 
or alkylated amino group, the acyl or alkyl group of

the two remaining groups are identical or different and 
denote H, hydroxyl, halogen or azido; 
R⁵ may also denote OH if R¹ and/or R² represent 
lipophilic groups; and 
R¹ and/or R² denote lipophilic groups and R⁶ and/or 
R⁷ denote hydrophilic groups or vice versa or the groups 

R¹, R², R⁶ and R⁷ are selected so that, together, they 
impart an amphiphilic nature to a dinucleoside phosphate 

analogue; and the corresponding salts of the acid forms 

of these compounds.
