 DRAG REDUCERS FOR FLOWING HYDROCARBONS BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONSummary of the Invention The present invention provides an alpha-olefin polymer or copolymer paste for reducing drag in the transportation of hydrocarbons through conduits and a method for preparing the same. Further, the present invention provides a drag reducer comprising a slurried alpha-olefin polymer or copolymer. The present invention also provides a process for precipitating an alpha-olefin polymer or copolymer which has been formed by solution polymerization. Background of the Invention The preparation of alpha-olefin polymers or copolymers for use as drag reducers in the transportation of hydrocarbons through conduits is well known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,584,244 describes the preparation of a drag reducer having an increased dissolution rate in flowing hydrocarbons. The process described includes the steps of grinding the polymer to a powder in the presence of a coating agent in order to preclude clumping. Additionally, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,771,799 and 5,165,440 discuss the use of a drag reducing polymer solution, commonly referred to as a gel, which is formed into threads or filaments in order to increase the rate of polymer gel dissolution when placed into a hydrocarbon stream.While the foregoing approaches successfully achieve their goals, each method has inherent handling problems. For example, when using a powdered drag reducer, special equipment is required to place the polymer powder into a pipeline and to ensure complete dissolution of polymer within the hydrocarbon stream. The gel or solution 

drag reducers of Patent Numbers 4,771,799 and 5,168,440 are shown to dissolve more readily. However, the introduction of the drag reducer gel to the hydrocarbon stream according to these disclosures necessitates the use of special equipment and pressurized containers. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a drag reducer in a form which allows for rapid dissolution of the polymer and does not require transportation of solvents or high pressures.It is an object of the present invention to provide an alpha-olefin polymer or copolymer paste capable of providing a drag reducer for use in flowing hydrocarbons which is easier to handle. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the following disclosure. BRIEF DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIn general, the present invention provides a process for precipitating an alpha-olefin polymer or copolymer (hereinafter collectively referred to as
