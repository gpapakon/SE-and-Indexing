<ABSTRACT>
In a charging arrangement (1) for the time-controlled charging of at least 
one rechargeable cell (2), comprising a supply device (21) for the charging current 

supply, a switching device (25) for stopping a charging current supply, and a control 
device (27) having a time signal generation stage (28), which upon expiry of a time 

interval after a beginning of a charging current supply supplies a time signal (H) which 
controls the switching device (25) so as to stop a charging current supply, the time 

signal generation stage (28) comprises a temperature measurement device (32) for 
measuring the ambient temperature of the charging arrangement (1), which temperature 

measurement device in the case of a variation of the ambient temperature controls the 
time signal generation stage (28) for the time-shifted supply of the time signal (H).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a charging arrangement for the time-controlled
charging of at least one rechargeable cell, comprising a supply device which enables a
charging current to be supplied to the at least one rechargeable cell, a switching device
which enables a charging current supply to the at least one rechargeable cell to be
started and stopped, and a control device provided to control the switching device and
comprising a time signal generation stage which, upon expiry of a time interval after a
beginning of a charging current supply, supplies a time signal which controls the
switching device so as to stop the charging current supply.Such a charging arrangement of the type defined in the opening paragraph
is known in different variants and is described in, for example, the February 1988 issue
of the Dutch magazine "Elektuur", pages 74 to 79. In the known circuit arrangements
the time signal generation stage supplies the time signal to terminate a charging current
supply to a rechargeable cell upon expiry of a time interval after the beginning of a
charging current supply, which time interval may be adjustable by hand but for the rest
remains always the same. Consequently, all the charging operations are ended after a
given constant charging time. The charging time may be, for example, eight hours, and
the charging current may then have a value between 0.1 C and 0.3 C. By means of the
known charging arrangements nickel-cadmium batteries (NiCd batteries), whose
charging characteristics are substantially independent of the ambient temperature, can be
charged without any problems but this is not so in the case of batteries such as nickel-metal-hydride
batteries (NiMH batteries), whose charging characteristics depend
comparatively strongly on the ambient temperature.It is an object of the invention to construct and improve a charging
arrangement of the type defined in the opening paragraph in such a manner that
batteries, such as NiMH batteries, whose charging characteristics are dependent on the
ambient temperature, can be charged without any problems. To this end the invention is
characterised in that the time signal generation stage comprises a temperature 
measurement device for measuring the ambient temperature of the charging
arrangement, which temperature measurement device in the case of a variation of the
ambient temperature controls the time signal generation stage for the time-shifted supply
of the time signal to stop a charging current supply after a beginning of this charging
current
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A charging arrangement (1) for the time-controlled charging of at least
one rechargeable cell (2), comprising a supply device (21) which enables a charging

current (I) to be supplied to the at least one rechargeable cell (2), a switching device
(25) which enables a charging current supply to the at least one rechargeable cell (2) to

be started and stopped, and a control device (27) provided to control the switching
device (25) and comprising a time signal generation stage (28) which, upon expiry of a

time interval after a beginning of a charging current supply, supplies a time signal (H)
which controls the switching device (25) so as to stop the charging current supply,

characterised in that the time signal generation stage (28) comprises a temperature
measurement device (32) for measuring the ambient temperature of the charging

arrangement (1), which temperature measurement device in the case of a variation of
the ambient temperature controls the time signal generation stage (28) for the time-shifted

supply of the time signal (H) to stop a charging current supply after a beginning
of this charging current supply,

thereby to adapt the charging time to changes in the charge
storage capacity of the at least one rechargeable cell (2)

as the ambient temperature changes.
A charging arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the
time signal generation stage (28) comprises an oscillator (30) for generating an

oscillator signal, which oscillator includes the temperature measurement device (32) as a
frequency-determining element, and a counting circuit (31) adapted to count the periods

of the oscillator signal and following the oscillator (30), which counting circuit upon
reaching a given count initiates the supply of the time signal (H) to stop a charging

current supply.
A charging arrangement as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the time signal generation stage (2) comprises a resistor with a negative temperature

coefficient as temperature measurement device (28).
