<ABSTRACT>
An element of elongate shape (18) is fixed on the closest spacer plate (8a) of the steam generator to the curved parts (10'c, 10''c, 10'''c) of the tubes (10) of the bundle, in a central free zone of the bundle, straight above the small curves (10''c) of the tubes of the bundle. Antivibration bars (15) of an assembly of bars intended to be placed between any two adjacent sheets (20) of the bundle of tubes are fixed by their internal end on a connection piece (16) in the shape of a fan. The piece (16) comprises means of hooking onto corresponding means of the elongate element (18). The assembly of antivibration bars (15) intended to come in a space comprised between two successive sheets (20) of the bundle of the heat exchanger is thus put in place in a single operation. The invention applies in particular to the steam generators of pressurised water nuclear reactors.
