<ABSTRACT>
In a station for cleaning, restoring and protecting 
the nozzles (26) of an ink jet printer, a cleaning blade 

(34) is connected to the nozzle restoring and protecting 
device (40) and controlled by it when moved by the motion 

of the print head (22) into its operating position. The 
restoring device (40) comprises two covers (50) that are 

selectively coupled to one or the other of two heads for 
printing in black or in color, respectively. The 

restoring device sets the cleaning blade in the best 
position for cleaning the two heads, by means of a rocker 

(80). The service station is of a simple construction and 
uses a small number of component parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a service station
for an ink jet printer.United States Patent US-A-5,155,497 (Martin et al.)
discloses a service station which includes a cleaning
member which removes residues of ink from the print head,
and also includes means for isolating the head from the
external environment to maintain it in an efficient
condition. The service station uses a support that can
be rotated selectively through 180Â°. This support carries
on one side a first cleaning blade and a first elastic
cover, and on the opposite side a second blade and a
second elastic cover. Depending on what type of head the
printer is using, i.e. either a head for printing in black
or a head for printing in colors, the support is rotated
as required in order selectively to couple the first blade
and cover or the second blade and cover, to one or the
other head.This service station is therefore of complex
construction in view of the large number of component
parts, and is very space-hungry, especially if it is to be
fitted to a small printer.An object of the present invention is therefore to
provide a service station of simple construction that
takes up relatively little space.The invention is defined in the independent claims
below, to which reference should now be made.
Advantageous features of the invention are set forth in
the appendant claims.A preferred embodiment is described in more detail
below, in which an ink jet printer has a station for
cleaning, restoring and protecting the nozzles of the 
print head. A cleaning blade is coupled to the nozzle
restoring device and is controlled by it when moved, by
the motion of the print head, into its operating position.
The restoring device comprises two covers, or caps, that
can be selectively coupled to one or the other of two
heads for printing in black or in color respectively.
The restoring device sets the cleaning blade in the best
position for cleaning the two heads, by means of a rocker.
The preferred service station is of relatively simple
construction and uses only a small number of component
parts.The invention will be described in more detail, by
way of example, with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows an ink jet printer
comprising a service station embodying the invention;Fig. 2 shows a front view of the service station at
rest;Fig. 3 shows the service station of Fig. 2 in
operation;Figs. 4 to 6 show on an enlarged scale front, side,
and plan views respectively of a support of the service
station shown in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A service station for an ink jet printer, said
printer including a carriage (14) that moves with respect

to a printing support (28), said carriage comprising a
trigger member (90); and a print head (22) of a first kind

carried on said carriage having a plurality of nozzles for
depositing drops of ink on said printing support, said

service station comprising:

cleaning means for cleaning said print head (22)
on said carriage when said carriage is moved toward said

service station, said cleaning means including a flexible
blade (34) that slides over said print head to remove

residues of ink thereon, said blade being movable from a
position of interference with said print head to an

inactive position spaced away from said print head;
nozzle restoring and protecting means (40) for
restoring and protecting said nozzles of said print head

when said carriage is located at said service station,
said restoring and protecting means including a support

(42), said support including ink collecting means (46) for
collecting the ink purged from said nozzles and supporting

a cover (50) for protecting said nozzles, said support
being mounted on and capable of pivoting around a shaft

(44) perpendicular to the motion of said print head (22)
from a rest position, in which said cover is away from

said print head, to an operating position, in which said
cover is in contact with said print head;

characterized in that said support (42) has a rib (94)
slidingly coupled to a lever (91), said lever being

engageable by said trigger member (90) during the movement
of said carriage toward said service station, for pivoting

said support from said rest position to said operating
position, said support being connected to said blade (34)

by means of a rocker (80) so as to move said blade to said
inactive position spaced away from said print head

simultaneously with the movement of said support to said
operating position to bring said cover in contact with

said print head (22).
A service station according to Claim 1,
characterized in that said ink collecting means is

provided with a hole (66) of elongate section through
which said shaft (44) passes, to allow said ink collecting

means to move with respect to said support.
