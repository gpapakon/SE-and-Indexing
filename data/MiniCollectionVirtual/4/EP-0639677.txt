<ABSTRACT>
A building composed of modules of prefabricated units is distinguished in that each module (1) exhibits a frame structure which is welded to form a steel skeleton (2), which is composed of a rectangular base frame (3), of a rectangular cover frame (4) and of four vertical supports (5), and of which the outer surfaces (10 and 11) and, if required, also inner surfaces (12 and 13) are clad (lined), to provide heat insulation and sound insulation, with lightweight building panels (14, 15, 16), and of which the floors (6) and ceilings (7) are designed with prefabricated, self-supporting, concrete slab elements (20, 21) which can be pushed into guides (47) formed by steel sections (30) of the base frame and cover frame (3, 4).

Building composed from modules of prefabricated units, whereby
each module (1) has a frame structure weldable to form a steel

skeleton (2), which frame structure consists of a rectangular base
frame (3), a rectangular ceiling frame (4) and four vertical supports

(5), the outer surfaces of which frame structure (10 or 11
respectively) and where necessary also the inner surfaces (12 or 13

respectively) are lined for heat- and sound-insulating purposes with
lightweight building boards (14 - 16), and the floors (6) and ceilings

(7) of which frame structure are formed with prefabricated self-supporting
concrete slab elements (20, 21) insertable into

guideways (47) formed by steel sections (30) of the base frame or
ceiling frame (3, 4) respectively,
characterized in that

the base frame (3) of a steel skeleton (2) has double-T longitudinal
and transverse girders (30), e.g. IPB 160, welded at right-angles to

each other, the lower outer-wall-side flanges (31) of which girders
have at intervals welded-on, cantilevered flat bars (28a, 28b) with

vertical guide stays (26a, 26b), which stays are formed as brackets
for layable outside-wall lining slabs (15).
Building according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the ceiling frame (4) consists of square-section tubes (35), to which
tubes, at intervals, steel angles (36) pointing inwards and formed as

supports for the ceiling slabs (21) are prewelded.
Building according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that

several steel skeletons (2) forming one building are connected by 
tie rods (40, 41) with connecting elements in standard use in

mechanical engineering or steel construction respectively.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 3,
characterized in that

the longitudinal girders (32) of the base frame (3) are rigidly welded
at one end to a transverse girder (33), whereas the transverse girder

(34) of the other end is connectable with the longitudinal girders
(32) by using detachable connectors in standard use in

mechanical engineering or steel construction.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 4,
characterized in that

U-section girders, e.g. U 160, insertable between the flanges (29) of
the double-T longitudinal girders (32) are welded in as transverse

girders (33 or 34 respectively).
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 5,
characterized in that

lightweight concrete slabs (15) made of aerated or gas concrete or
of expanded concrete and/or of concrete containing pulverized

fuel ash, fibres or waste from synthetic or organic material are
provided for the outside wall lining, which slabs have a weight of

between 1100 and 1400 kg/m
3
.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 5,
characterized in that

the inside walls are also lined with boards (16) which consist of
lightweight building materials and are preferably gypsum-bound

products such as staff boards or sandwich-type plaster boards,
gypsum-bound expanded plastic boards with a porous structure or

other familiar gypsum building materials. 
Building according to claim 7,
characterized in that

inside-wall lining boards (16) consisting of gypsum building materials
have a weight of between 450 and 800 kg/m
3
, preferably between
550 and 750 kg/m
3
.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 5,
characterized in that

the lining boards (15, 16) consist to at least 80% of recyclable
plastic waste.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 9,
characterized in that

lining boards (16) for inside walls (12, 13) are formed with integrated
supply and drainage lines for electricity and water as prefabricated

components.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 10,
characterized in that

the outside-wall lining of a module (1) is in multi-layer form with a
lightweight building board layout (14, 15) with an insulating gap

between the layers.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 11,
characterized in that

the base frame (3) is assigned a strip foundation (22) which bears a
steel supporting and fixing plate (23) anchored in the foundation

(22).
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 12,
characterized in that

modules (la, 1b, 1c, etc.) located adjacent to one another or on
one another are insulated reciprocally against the spreading of

structure-borne sound by intermediate layers (50) of sound-insulating 
plasticized resilient material such as neoprene rubber.
Building according to one or more of claims 1 through 13,
characterized in that

a stairway (8) assemblable from prefabricated elements is
placeable in front of it and that it is coverable with a roof (9).
