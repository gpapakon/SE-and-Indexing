<ABSTRACT>
A lifting apparatus for lifting equipment 220 into position on the 
lower surface of a horizontally extending projection 200, such as a 

weapon station 200 on an aircraft is described. The apparatus comprises 
a main body 100 positioned above the projection 200, from which lifting 

cables 115, 120 are lowered and attached to the equipment 220 to be 
raised or to a tray 140 on which it is positioned. A drive mechanism 130 

is used to raise the equipment 220 into position below the projection 
200. The equipment 220 is fixed in position and the apparatus removed. 

Guide bars 105, 110 may optionally be used, to control the movement of 
the equipment 220 whilst it is being raised.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for lifting loads into 
position on an aircraft, and more specifically for lifting weapons into 
position on a rotary winged aircraft (helicopter) using a single person 
who may be located remotely. Operational, rotary winged aircraft (helicopters) are frequently 
deployed from surface ships having decks from which the helicopters take 
off, land and are sometimes refuelled, serviced and rearmed. These decks 
are usually positioned at the rear of the ship to allow the helicopter 
easier access to and from the deck during landing and take off. Because 
of their positioning at the rear of the ship, the deck is subject to 
considerable movement such as vertical movement caused by the ship 
pitching and yawing caused by the ship turning and by waves. Refuelling, 
servicing and rearming a helicopter during such movement poses 
considerable problems with the handling of heavy objects such as weapons 
which can move uncontrollably as the ship pitches and yaws. Conventionally, during weapon arming, the weapons, which are of 
considerable weight, were controlled by using a number of crew members to 
stabilise the weapons while they were being lifted. With modern ships 
the number of crew is being reduced for a variety of reasons, including 
economic ones. During a turn-around between landing and take off of the 
helicopter many tasks, including refuelling and servicing of the 
mechanical and electrical systems of the helicopter must be completed by 
the crew. With the restricted space available on the deck of the ship, 
the total number of crew available to work on the helicopter is 
restricted. Whilst members of the crew are assisting with the 
stabilisation of the weapons being lifted into position they are not able 
to complete the other required tasks. In addition there is a risk of 
injury to the crew by being hit by a heavy moving weapon. Helicopters, such as the Sea King and Lynx helicopter have weapon 
stations which protrude from the side of the helicopter and to which the 
weapons are affixed below these stations. The weapons are lifted into 
place by fixing a frame in the shape of a tripod to the helicopter above  
 
the upper surface of the weapon station. Lifting cables are then lowered 
from the apex of the A and attached to the weapon. The weapon is carried 
on a trolley. A winch or similar mechanism is then used to hoist the 
weapon into position below the weapon station. More modern helicopters have multiple weapons affixed to the same 
weapon station.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for loading equipment (220) into position on an 
aircraft, the aircraft having a substantially horizontally extending 

substantially planar projection (200) to which the equipment (220) is to 
be attached, the apparatus comprising: 

   a body (100), of length sufficient to overlap the projection (200), 
positioned, in use, adjacent to the aircraft and above the projection 

(200); 
   two or more lifting cables (115, 120), for lifting the equipment 

into position below the projection (200); and 
   drive mechanism means (130), attached to the body (100), causing 

the lifting cables (115, 120) to lift the equipment into position below 
the projection (200). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 further comprising a tray (140) 
to which, during loading, the lifting cables (115, 120) attach and on 

which the equipment is transported to the aircraft. 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim further comprising 
one or more guide bars (105, 110), the guide bars (105, 110) being 

substantially "U" shaped, and pivoting at the centre of the "U", on a 
horizontal axis perpendicular to the major axis of the body (100), from a 

stowed position in which the arms are substantially parallel to the body 
(100) to an operating position in which the arms extend towards the 

equipment (220) being loaded. 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the aircraft 
is a rotary winged aircraft. 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the 
projection (200) has affixed to it two or more pieces of equipment (220). 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the drive 
mechanism means (130) is powered electrically and is capable of being 

remotely controlled by an operator. 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the 
equipment is a weapon 220.
