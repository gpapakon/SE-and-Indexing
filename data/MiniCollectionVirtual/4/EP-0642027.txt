<ABSTRACT>
A method is specified for measuring earth faults on the conductors of electrical machines, in which method the fault resistance (Rf) is directly calculated from the injected voltage (Ui) and the measured voltage (URE) in a digital evaluation unit (7). Since the fault resistance is explicitly calculated and indicated, it is independent of the influences of the earth reactance. In addition, it is not necessary to record characteristic curves, with the aid of which the fault resistance is reduced, for each machine. Furthermore, by virtue of the digital calculation, the influence of deterioration, temperature fluctuations, injection-level fluctuations etc. is eliminated.
