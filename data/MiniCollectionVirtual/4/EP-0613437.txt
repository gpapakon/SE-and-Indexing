<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement in a vessel for loading or unloading of a flowable medium, especially oil, the vessel (1) being provided with a submerged downwardly open receiving space (3) for receiving and securing a submarine buoy (2) which is anchored to the sea bed (4) and is coupled to at least one transfer line (6) for medium. The receiving space (3) is arranged at a submerged location at the outer side of the hull of the vessel and has an at least partly downwards essentially conically enlarged shape, for mating with a buoy (2) of a corresponding outer shape. In connection with the receiving space (3) there is provided a service shaft (9) connecting the receiving space (3) with the deck (8) of the vessel. The receiving space (3) preferably is formed from a module built into the bow portion of the vessel (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement in a vessel for
loading or unloading of a flowable medium, especially oil, the
vessel being provided with a submerged downwardly open receiving
space for receiving and securing a buoy which is anchored to the
sea bed and is coupled to at least one transfer line for medium.There are previously known various embodiments of
loading/unloading systems for the transfer of oil by means of a
submerged buoyancy unit or buoy which, during operation, is
received and secured in a submerged receiving space on a vessel,
especially at the underside thereof. A system comprising a vessel
of the above-mentioned type is known from e.g. US patent
specification No. 4 604 961 (corresponds to Norwegian patent
specification No. 167 906). This known system is based on a
vessel having a through-going deck opening in a central region
of the vessel, the lower part of the through opening forming the
receiving space for a mooring element in the form of a submerged
buoy. In the receiving space there is arranged a rotating body
(turret) which is rotatably mounted in the hull of the vessel and
is designed for receipt and attachment of the mooring element,
the latter to this end being provided with a hydraulically
actuated locking mechanism for attachment to the rotating body.
Further, the vessel is provided with a derrick for the lowering
of a retrieval string having a retrieval connector at its lower
end for interconnection with the mooring element, so that this
may be pulled up and into the receiving space. The interconnection
is obtained in that the mooring element is provided with a
conical centering receptacle having a socket arranged at the
bottom wherein the retrieval connector may be received and
secured, e.g. by means of a bayonet lock. The lower end of the
retrieval string preferably is provided with sonar and TV
equipment to ensure positioning of the retrieval connector in the
centering receptacle.The known system is encumbered with some drawbacks
which will be discussed below.As mentioned, the vessel of the known system is based
on a through-going deck opening, which reduces the strength of 
the vessel and poses demands for additional reinforcements
in the bottom and the deck of the vessel. Experience has
also shown that ships having a through-going deck opening
are subject to fatigue in the hull. A ship having such a
through-going shaft or opening has to be constructed with
its definite objective kept in view, and it will be a very
expensive solution to carry out modifications of

<CLAIMS>
A vessel including an arrangement for transfer of a
flowable medium to or from cargo tanks on the vessel (1),

the arrangement comprising a downwardly open receiving
space (3) arranged in the vessel, a buoy (2) comprising a

central member arranged to be anchored to the sea bed (4)
and coupled to a transfer line (6) for the medium and an

outer member rotatably mounted thereon, and adapted to be
releasably secured in the receiving space by locking means

(45, 46) in the space, and hoisting means (11) arranged on
a deck (8) of the vessel (1) for hoisting the buoy (2) into

the receiving space (3), characterized in that the
receiving space (3) is arranged in a submerged part of the

bow portion of the vessel (1) and has an upwardly tapering
shape at least partly corresponding to the outer shape of

the buoy (2) and arranged for forming a seal between the
buoy (2) and the receiving space (3) when the buoy is

secured in the receiving space, that the receiving space
(3) communicates with the deck (8) via a service shaft (9)

for allowing the lowering of a sink line (12) through the
receiving space (3) for connection with and hoisting of the

buoy by the hoisting means (11), and in that the locking
means (45, 46) is arranged for ensuring sealing between the

buoy and the receiving space when the buoy is secured in
the receiving space.
A vessel according to claims 1 having a shutter (10)
in the receiving space (3) at the lower end of the shaft

(9) for shutting-off the shaft (9) from the sea when the
receiving space is not in use.
A vessel according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the shaft
(9) is provided with a closing means (51) at the upper end

thereof.
A vessel according to claim 3 wherein the service
shaft (9) is connected to an inert gas and ventilation

arrangement (50) on the vessel (1).
A vessel according to any preceding claim wherein the
receiving space (3) has a downwardly facing sealing flange

(48) arranged to form sealing abutment against a cooperating 
abutment surface (47) of the buoy (2) when the

buoy is in the receiving space, so that the space above the
buoy is sealed against the surrounding sea.
A vessel according to any preceding claim wherein the
receiving space (3) is coupled to at least one drainage

conduit (49) for drainage of liquid from the receiving
space (3) and the shaft (9).
A vessel according to any preceding claim wherein the
receiving space (3) communicates with a thruster space (17)

accommodating thrusters (18) of the vessel (1), whereby the
receiving space is accessible from the thruster space, and

vice versa.
A vessel according to any preceding claim wherein the
locking means comprises at least two hydraulically actuated

locking dogs (45), the dogs being mounted for rotation
about horizontal axes (46) at the side of the receiving

space (3) between locking and release positions.
A vessel according to any preceding claim having in
the receiving space (3) a coupling unit (35) connected to

a tube system (36) of the vessel (1), the coupling unit
