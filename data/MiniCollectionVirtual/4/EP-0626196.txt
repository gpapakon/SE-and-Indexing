<ABSTRACT>
A device for metering solids present in a gas/solids stream includes a fluidised-bed apparatus (1) in which gas and solids are present as a free-flowing mixture in a fluidised bed (2) at least in the region of an outlet orifice (3) provided in an outlet line (4) for drawing off the gas/solids stream. Means are provided by which a driving force acting between the level of the outlet orifice (3) and the end region of the outlet line (4) is set, independently of the type and amount of the particular solid present. The height (H) of the fluidised bed (2) and/or the pressure above the fluidised bed (2) are adjusted, preferably simultaneously. At least one gravimetric measuring device (15) for determining the mass throughput of solid flowing out of the outlet orifice (4) and/or at least one differential pressure meter is (are) provided, a pressure measurement point (12') being provided - in particular just above - the bottom (11) of the fluidised-bed apparatus (1), preferably at the level of the outlet orifice (3) - and a second pressure measurement point (16) assigned to the end region of the outlet line (4) and, if appropriate, at least one further pressure measurement point (12e) being provided in the fluidised-bed apparatus (1) above the fluidised bed (2).

an at least partly gas permeable - especially

porous, practically consisting of sintered metal -
wall (7) and is at least partially coaxially

surrounded by a gassing channel (8);
b) at least one, especially annular, gassing

nozzles symmetrically positioned with regard to
the outlet opening (3) - ends directly at the

discharge opening (3) in the fluidised bed
apparatus (1).
A device according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that at least the floor of the

fluidised bed apparatus (1) is of a funnel shape
wherein areas separated from one another have been

provided to which fluidising gas can be admitted -
if applicable by way of annular lines (9) or lines

(25) reaching into the interior of the fluidised
bed apparatus (1) - independent of the others.
A device according to one of the preceding claims
wherein - at least in the floor area - several

funnel-shaped areas (14a, 14b) are provided
characterised in that fluidising gas can be 

admitted to each of these funnel-shaped areas
(14a, 14b) independent of the others.
A device according to one of the preceding claims

following characteristics is provided:

a) a gassing nozzle assigned to the discharge
opening (3) constructed as a hollow body (5) and

at least an additional pressure measuring point is
arranged in the hollow body (5);
b) a - especially memory programmable - control
device (34) for the control of at least one valve

provided in at least one pressure line admitting
fluidising gas to the floor (11) of the fluidised

bed apparatus (1) and/or one valve provided in a
pressure line (10, 10') admitting fluidising gas
