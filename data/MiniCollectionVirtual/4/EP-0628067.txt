<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an asphalt (or bitumen) composition, and its
process of preparation.The elimination of used tires is becoming an increasingly difficult
problem throughout the world. As an example of the importance of the problem,
over 200,000 tons of waste tires and tubes are produced each year in Canada. In the
United States of America, that amount is close to 4,000,000 tons.Although it is very attractive to consider the possibility of using waste
rubber products such as tires or tubes in asphalt (or bitumen) compositions, there
are a number of significant obstacles related to such use. Scrap tires contain
different types of vulcanized rubber, for example polyisoprene, polybutadiene,
styrene-butadiene, butyl, ethylene-propylene-diene, as well as fillers, plasticizers,
surfactants and the like. Sometimes, tires contain up to 31 different elastomers.
Ground rubber or crumb rubber does not disintegrate readily, because of the crosslinking
of the polymeric material that takes place by the vulcanization process with
sulfur. The additional chemical bonds created during this vulcanization render
impossible the complete dissolution of the polymer in hot bitumen, thus causing
problems of stability and storage of the material. Furthermore, such mixtures are
not homogeneous, and form two phases of different density which are partially
dispersed one in the other. The system tends to decant and causes the upper layers,
which have a lower density, to be constituted of polymer, while the lower layers,
which have a higher density, are constituted of bituminous material.At high temperature, conventional asphalt compositions, that is
asphalt cement for use in pavement which meet ASTM-D-946-74 or ASTM-D-3381-83
specifications, become fluid and even sticky, causing aggregate deformation or
rutting, while at lower temperatures, they become fragile and crack easily.
Toughness and durability of asphalt compositions are directly proportional to the
resistance of the asphalt to deformation under the effect of stress.DE 38 19 931 discloses polymer-modified bitumen compositions
comprising bitumen in admixture with an olefin, the latter having been oxidized
before being mixed with bitumen. These compositions are alleged to be binders in 
hot-mix asphalt such as pavements. These compositions, as useful as they could be,
are however extremely expensive, because of the use of virgin olefins, that is, brand
new synthetic olefins which have never been used before.CA 1,109,191; CA 1,209,295; CA 1,137,242 and CA 1,137,243

<CLAIMS>
A process for obtaining a homogeneous asphalt
composition comprising the steps of :


a) mixing asphalt with synthetic or natural
rubber particles obtained from waste tires or tire inner-tubes

at a temperature of from 160 to 200°C in order to
have the particles in suspension in the asphalt;
b) raising the temperature to 200 to 260°C;
c) allowing the mixture of step a) to stand in
at least one reactor for a period of time varying from 1

to 15 hours;
d) injecting air in the mixture at a pressure
of from 69 to 345 KPa;
e) homogenizing the mixture;
f) incorporating a vulcanizing agent chosen
from elemental selenium, organo-selenium, selenium salt,

elemental sulfur, organo-sulfur and sulfur salt or mixtures
thereof, and agitating; and
g) recovering the homogeneous asphalt composition.
A process according to claim 1, wherein step
d) is performed by injecting air from the bottom of the

reactor.
A process according to claim 1, wherein step
e) is performed with a dispersing device consisting of a

vessel comprising one or more toothed and rotating discs.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the
rubber particles are up to 1.27 cm thick.
A process according to claim 1, wherein step
f) is performed by incorporating an accelerator with the

vulcanizing agent, said accelerator being chosen from
thiazol, thiuram derivatives, mixtures of zinc oxide and

stearic acid or mixtures thereof.
A process according to claim 1, wherein a
petroleum fraction consisting of light or medium cycle 

oil is incorporated in the mixture of step a).
A process according to anyone of the
preceding claims, wherein step a) comprises mixing from

60 to 99 % by weight of asphalt with 1 to 40 % by weight
of rubber particles, and step f) comprises incorporating

0.01 to 3 % by weight of the vulcanizing agent and agitating
for 0.5 to 5 hours.
An homogeneous asphalt composition obtained
by carrying out a process according to anyone of claims 1

to 7, said composition comprising :

from 60 to 99 % by weight of asphalt;
from 1 to 40 % by weight of synthetic or
natural rubber dissolved in the asphalt; and
from 0.01 to 3 % by weight of a vulcanizing
agent selected from elemental selenium, organo-selenium,

selenium salt, or mixtures thereof.
An homogeneous asphalt composition according
to claim 8 comprising :


from 80 to 95 % by weight of asphalt;
from 5 to 20 % by weight of synthetic or
natural rubber; and
from 0.1 to 0.3 % by weight of such vulcanizing

agent.
An homogeneous asphalt composition
according to claim 8 or 9, wherein said composition

comprises :

89.9 % by weight of asphalt;
10.0 % by weight of synthetic or natural
rubber;
0.1 % by weight of elemental selenium as a
vulcanizing agent.
An homogeneous asphalt composition according
to claim 8 or 9, further comprising from 2 to 20 % by

weight of a petroleum fraction consisting of light or
medium cycle oil, and/or from 0.01 to 3 % by weight of an 

accelerator chosen from thiazol, thiuram derivatives,
mixtures of zinc oxide and stearic acid or mixtures

thereof.
An homogeneous asphalt composition
according to claim 8 or 9, wherein said synthetic rubber

comprises one or more compounds selected from styrene-butadiene-styrene
(SBS) and styrene-butadiene-rubber
