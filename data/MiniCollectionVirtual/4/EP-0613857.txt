<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - The invention relates to the 
purification of argon. More particularly, it relates 
to the improved production of high purity argon 
product. Description of the Prior Art - In current commercial 
practice, cryogenic distillation of an argon-containing 
gas stream produces low pressure argon of approximately 
97% purity, having a 2% oxygen and 1% nitrogen content. 
This crude argon is then compressed, typically to 70 
psia, cooled and mixed with hydrogen over a noble metal 
catalyst in deoxo, i.e. catalytic combustion, units. 
The hydrogen reacts with the residual oxygen content of 
the crude argon to form moisture and generate heat. 
After cooling and condensate removal, the resulting 
purified argon stream is passed through an adsorption 
system to dry the gas to a suitable dew point. During 
periods of high ambient and/or cooling water 
temperature, the feed gas to the adsorption system may 
be as hot as 115Â°F, representing both a significant 
increase in its moisture content and a reduction in the 
capacity of the adsorbent material to adsorb the 
moisture from the purified argon stream. Such 
circumstances leads to operational problems, such as 
premature moisture breakthrough from the adsorption 
system and/or reduced adsorbent cycle time. The latter 
problem results in increased product loss upon 
blowdown, i.e., depressurization of the adsorbent 
vessel, and an increase in the back purge requirements 
of the system.  There is a genuine desire in the art for reduction 
in temperature sensitivity and improvement in the 
operational stability of drying the purified argon 
stream recovered from a deoxo unit. Such desirable 
benefits need to be achieved, for practical commercial 
purposes, in a simple, low cost manner. It is an object of the invention, therefore, to 
provide an improved process and system for the 
production of dry, high purity argon. It is another object of the invention to provide 
an improved process and system for the purification of 
crude argon streams. It is a further object of the invention to provide 
a simple, low cost process and system for reducing the 
temperature sensitivity, and improving the operational 
stability of crude argon purification operations. With these types and other objects in mind, the 
invention is hereinafter described in detail, the novel 
features thereof being particularly pointed out in the 
appended claims. A membrane dryer is used to dry a purified argon 
stream that has passed through a catalytic 
deoxygenation, i.e.,
