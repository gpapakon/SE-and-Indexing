<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses an antenna switched 
diversity receiver comprising a plurality of physically 

separated antennas, a switching unit for selectively switching 
to one of the plurality of antennas to receive a burst in a 

time series, a decoding unit for decoding transmission data 
contained in the received burst in a reversed manner to coding, 

a bit-error-detecting unit for detecting a bit error in decoded 
data in each received burst, and a control uni
t for controlling 
the switching unit in accordance with the bit-error detection 

result. The receiver may additionally include a RSSI checking 
unit for checking a RSSI of a switched antenna and a RSSI 

holding unit for holding a RSSI. The receiver constructed as 
above controls switching based on a bit error in each burst 

alone or together with the RSSI. As a result, the receiver 
obtains excellent diversity effect while being compact and 

economical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital radio system
in which data are transmitted in bursts by Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA), Time Division Duplex (TDD) or packets,
and more particularly, to an antenna switched diversity
receiver.In a radio system, a transmission channel over radiowave
propagation paths is susceptible to environments. Radiowave
signals traveling through propagation paths are subject to
"fading": a radiowave becomes weaker or transmission
characteristics vary at a receiving point. For example,
"multipath-fading" occurs when incoming waves, each having
their respective phases and amplitudes, interfere with each
other at a receiving point due to reflections or diffractions
from obstacles along the transmission paths.The multipath-fading is critical in a mobile radio
system because it causes considerable fluctuation in received
signal strength (electric field strength of a radio wave) each
time a mobile station moves. Similarly, in a digital radio
system, the multipath-fading causes an output decrease or
waveform distortion, resulting in a high bit-error-rate (BER); 
BER represents a ratio of erroneously received bits to total bits in a received signal. Bit
error rate detection can be used for selecting an antenna to receive a digital radio signal
from a plurality of receiving antennas by noting when the error rate exceeds a certain
threshold. A scheme for bit error rate detection is outlined in EP-A-0 400 983.Given these problems, "diversity technique" has been proposed in a variety
of embodiments. Basically, two or more branches having a small cross-correlation, i.e. a
small probability of simultaneous fading, are used to reduce the fading effects by
selecting or combining the output signals from the branches.The diversity technique divides into several schemes, which includes "space
diversity", depending on the branches used. [For further information, see "Mobile
Communications Engineering", William C. Y. Lee, McGraw-Hill Book Company] The
digital radio system, which uses a single carrier, employs the space diversity: two or
more transmission paths are constructed by setting physically separated antennas
(usually spaced out about a carrier's wave length or more) in a matching number,
making a cross-correlation small.Further, the space diversity sub-divides into "combining diversity" and
"selective-combining diversity". Two or more received signals are combined in the
combining diversity, while a received signal having the best quality is selected by
means of switching in the
