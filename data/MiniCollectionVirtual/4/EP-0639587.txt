<ABSTRACT>
Diene polymers or copolymers having improved raw polymer 
viscosity and reduced hysteresis in the cured and carbon black 

reinforced state are provided. These diene polymers or 
copolymers are prepared by a method which involves first 

terminating substantially all of the living diene polymer or 
copolymer chains obtained by anionic polymerization with a 

compound having multiple-bonded nitrogen atoms selected from 
the group consisting of aromatic nitriles and substituted 

imines having the formula 

and then coupling a portion of the resultant terminated 
polymer chains with a polyfunctional reagent selected from the 

groups consisting of silicon polyhalides, polyisocyanates, 
phosphoryl halides and polycarboxylic acid halides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to diene polymers or copolymers 
having improved raw polymer viscosity which are adapted to 
form elastomer compositions having reduced hysteresis 
properties and tire treads having reduced rolling resistance. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a method for 
preparing such diene polymers or copolymers which involves 
terminating the polymer chains with a compound having 
multiple-bonded nitrogen atoms and partially crosslinking the 
polymer chains with a polyfunctional reagent.  
 In recent years, those active in the tire industry have 
greatly increased their emphasis on the development of tires 
having both reduced rolling resistance and good wet traction 
properties. As is well known, that portion of the tire which 
exerts the greatest influence on rolling resistance and 
traction is the tread or tread rubber portion. Low rolling 
resistance is desirable from a fuel consumption standpoint 
while good wet traction is desirable from a safety standpoint. 
However, as a general rule, these properties have been found 
to conflict with each other. Thus, a reduction in rolling 
resistance generally leads to an almost directionally 
proportional reduction in wet traction while an increase in 
wet traction generally leads to an almost directionally 
proportional increase in rolling resistance. The prior art has proposed a number of approaches to the 
solution of this problem. Such approaches have generally 
involved modifying the properties of the elastomer or 
elastomer composition utilized to form the tire tread in order 
to achieve the best possible balance between rolling 
resistance and traction. The approaches involving 
modification of the elastomer have generally been based on 
improving the interaction between the elastomer and the carbon 
black used in compounding the elastomer to prepare the tire 
tread composition in order to improve the dispersion of the 
carbon black into the elastomer. This has the effect of 
reducing the hysteresis of the elastomer composition which in 
turn results in lower rolling resistance of the treads formed 
therefrom. One known approach to modifying the diene polymer or 
copolymer elastomer to reduce the hysteresis of elastomer 
compositions formed therefrom involves coupling the living 
diene polymer or copolymer chains with metal halides. Thus, 
U.S. patents 4,383,085 and 4,515,922 describe the coupling of 
living diene polymer or copolymer chains obtained by anionic 
polymerization using an organolithium initiator with metal  
 
halide
