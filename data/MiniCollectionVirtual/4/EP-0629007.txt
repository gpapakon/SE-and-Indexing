<ABSTRACT>
A piezoelectric device includes an at least 
locally thin-walled ceramic substrate (2) and at least one 

film-type piezoelectric transducer (3) on the substrate. 
The substrate is locally formed with at least one cavity (4) 

defined by at least one peripheral wall (2c) and a bottom wall 
(2a) having a reduced thickness. The piezoelectric 

transducer is arranged on the outer surface opposite to 
the bottom wall and includes a first electrode layer, 

a piezoelectric layer and a second electrode layer which 
are sequentially laminated with each other. The outer 

surface of the substrate has relatively thick-walled regions 
(2d) adjacent to and surrounding said peripheral wall 

of the cavity. Each thick-walled region is formed with 
at least one groove (5) extending along the peripheral wall 

and having a depth which is greater than the thickness 
of the bottom wall. The groove (5) is arranged so as to 

permit simultaneous displacements of the bottom wall and 
the thick-walled region between the cavity and the 

groove, to thereby cause a volume change of the 
cavity (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric 
device for converting an input mechanical quantity into 
an output electrical quantity, and vice versa. As generally known in the art, piezoelectric 
devices are typically used to convert an input mechanical 
stress into an output electric charge (voltage) and also 
to convert an input electric voltage into an output 
mechanical distortion. In the latter case, the device 
is sometimes called as an electrostrictive device. 
The term "piezoelectric device" as used herein is to be 
interpreted in its broadest sense, as encompassing an 
electrostrictive device as well. Similarly, the term 
"piezoelectric material" as used herein is to be 
interpreted in its broadest sense as encompassing an 
electrostrictive material as well. When the output of 
the piezoelectric device is a mechanical distortion, 
such distortion can be used to generate mechanical force, 
displacement or vibration. Conventionally, piezoelectric devices have been  
 
used for various purposes. For example, in the field of 
optics or precision engineering, there is a progressive 
demand for actuators capable of adjusting lengths and/or 
positions of the optical path on a sub-micron order, or 
for sensors capable of detecting a fine mechanical 
displacement. There have been various proposals 
directed to such demands in conjunction with application 
of piezoelectric devices. Specifically, there is known 
unimorph- or bimorph-type piezoelectric device which 
undergoes bending or flexural deformation upon 
application of an input electrical voltage, and which 
can be used for ink jet printing heads, acoustic 
radiators (i.e., loudspeakers and the like), vibrators, 
etc. The unimorph- or bimorph-type piezoelectric device 
can also be used to convert a bending or flexural 
deformation into an electrical voltage, e.g., as a 
microphone or sensor. With reference, for example, to 
ink jet printing heads including a unimorph- or bimorph-type 
piezoelectric device, in view of customers' or end 
users' requirement for a high-quality and high-speed 
printing performance, it is highly desirable to realize 
a high density piezoelectric device having a minimized 
size, which operates at a low driving voltage and yet 
provides a satisfactory response characteristic and an 
operational reliability. For realizing the above-mentioned desired  
 
properties of the piezoelectric device, because the 
substrate in the region of each piezoelectric transducer 
functions as a diaphragm, it has been generally 
considere
