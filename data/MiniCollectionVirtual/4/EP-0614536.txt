<DESCRIPTION>
Copending U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. USSN 800, 336
filed contemporaneously herewith and meanwhile published with document US-A-5,157,090
contains subject matter related to that disclosed herein.This invention relates to a laser-based distance measurement device
more particularly to laser diode coherent interference-
according to the
precharacterizing part of claim 1.It is known that semiconductor lasers, such as laser
diodes, may be used for measuring distances as described
by: G. Behein et al, "Range Finding Using Frequency-Modulated
Laser Diode", Applied Optics, Volume 25, No. 9
(1986).A laser diode typically has an optical cavity
comprising two opposing polished ends (called facets)
each having a known index of refraction and having a
light amplifying medium therebetween. Light is generated
inside the diode cavity by passing electric current
through the p-n junction of the diode (typically using
ends of the diode other than the facets). The light
inside the diode cavity is reflected from a first (e.g.,
front) facet to a second (e.g., rear) facet in a
repetitive manner, thereby providing stimulated emission
and the well known laser action. Typically, the front
and rear facets are partially transparent (i.e., not 100%
reflective). Thus, some light exits the laser from both 
the front and rear facets. The amount of light exiting
an uncoated facet is determined by its index of
refraction.The behavior of a laser diode, as is known, can be
significantly affected by external optical feedback,
i.e., feedback of a portion of the laser output light
back into the laser cavity from an external reflecting
surface, as described in the article: R. Lang et al,
"External Optical Feedback Effects on Semiconductor
Injection Laser Properties", IEEE Journal of Quantum
Electronics, Volume QE-16, No. 3 (March 1980). A laser
diode together with an external reflective surface, e.g.,
a reflective target, can be viewed as a compound or
coupled laser cavity consisting of the diode cavity and
an external cavity formed by the reflective target and
the laser diode facet facing the target (e.g., the front
facet). The distance from the laser to the external
surface must be no longer than one-half the coherence
length (the distance over which the photons remain in-phase)
of the output light because the light must remain
coherent over the entire distance traveled (i.e., out to
the target and back to the laser). Coupled-cavity
effects in conventional lasers are well known, as
described in document US-A-4,550,410 entitled

<CLAIMS>
A laser-based distance measuring device for measuring the distance
to a target (26), comprising:


a) a laser (10),

having a variable optical operating frequency,
having a first facet (12) and a second facet (14) for
emitting a first output light from said first facet (12)

toward the target (26) and for emitting a second output
light from said second facet (14);
the first output light being incident on the target (26) and
having a wavelength which allows it to be scattered by the

target (26) back into said laser (10); and
the second output light having an intensity related to the
distance from said first facet (12) to the target (26) due to

coherent interference within said laser (10) between the
scattered light from the target (26) and light within said

laser (10);
b) laser drive means (104), for providing a variable laser drive
signal (16) to said laser (10) for varying the optical operating

frequency of said laser (10),
c) optical detection means (30),

responsive to the second output light,
for providing a feedback signal indicative of the intensity
of the second light; and
d) distance measurement means (18),

responsive to said feedback signal (32) from said optical
detection means (30),
for providing a signal (34) solely proportional to the
distance from said first facet (12) to the target (26);
characterized in that:
e) said laser drive signal (16) has a predetermined periodic sweep
frequency set to minimize speckle noise,
f) and said laser drive signal (16) comprises a sequence of single
ramp portions interspersed with stepped-down flat slope

portions.
Apparatus of claim 1 wherein said distance measurement means (18)
further comprises means (118, 262) for blanking out a portion of

said feedback signal (32) coincident with discontinuities of said laser
drive signal (16).
Apparatus of claim 1 or 2 wherein said distance measurement
means (18) further comprises means (118, 262) for blanking out a

portion of said feedback signal (32) coincident with discontinuities
caused by processing said feedback signal (32).
Apparatus of any of claims 1 to 3 wherein said distance
measurement means (18) further comprises means (138) for

counting pulses of said feedback signal.
Apparatus of any of claims 1 to 4 wherein said distance
measurement means (18) further comprises focusing means (22),

placed in the path of the first output light, capable of focusing the
first output light at a predetermined distance from said focusing

means (22).
Apparatus of any of claims 1 to 5 wherein said laser (10) comprises
a laser diode.
