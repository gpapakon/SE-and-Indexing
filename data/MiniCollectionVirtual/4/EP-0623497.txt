<ABSTRACT>
An accumulator conveyor, in particular an overhead conveyor (1) is described which has an elongated drive element (13). The drive element (13) is connected to conveyor means (4) in terms of drive. A dynamic pressure-actuated disconnection device (16) for temporarily disconnecting the drive connection when there is a blockage is provided. In order to design the conveyor (1) in a constructionally simple manner in such a way that it can be used universally, it is proposed to use an expansion device (16) as disconnection device in order to increase the distance between the conveyor means (4) and the drive element (13) so as to disconnect the drive connection.

Accumulable conveyor, in particular suspension 
conveyor (1), comprising an elongated drive member (13) 

which is in drive communication with conveyor means (4), 
and an impact-pressure actuated separation means (16) for 

temporarily disconnecting the drive connection in the 
accumulation area, 
characterized in
 that said separation 
means includes a spreader device (16) for increasing 

the distance between conveyor means (4) and drive member 
(13) for disconnecting said drive connection. 
A conveyor according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that 
said conveyor means (4) is swingingly hung via rollers (5a, 

5b) onto a rail (2) in a direction transverse to the 
conveying direction and is adapted to be pivoted away by 

said spreader device (16) in a direction transverse to 
conveying direction (B) from said drive member (13) 

extending laterally next to said conveyor means (4). 
A conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 
that said drive member is a friction belt (13). 
A conveyor according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in
 that said spreader device (16) has at 
least one abutment surface (19, 22) and at least one 

counter-surface (25, 26) which are arranged on conveyor 
means (4) successive in conveying direction (B), extend in 

a direction oblique to conveying direction (B) and abut on  
 

each other in the accumulation area such that said conveyor 
means (4.1, 4.2) which is the leading one in conveying 

direction (B) is separated from said drive member (13). 
A conveyor according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in
 that said spreader device (16) comprises a 
spring element (17) which is disposed between a contact 

surface (14) arranged outside said drive member (13) and in 
parallel therewith and said conveyor means (4). 
A conveyor according to claim 5, 
characterized in
 that 
said spring element (17) is movable into contact with said 

contact surface (15) by an actuating means (23) arranged on 
an immediately neighboring conveyor means (4). 
A conveyor according to claim 6, 
characterized in
 that 
said spring element is a spring web (17) which is secured 

with one of its ends (17a) to said conveyor means (4) and 
whose other end (17b) is provided with an abutment surface 

(19), and that said actuating means comprises a spreader 
projection (23) provided with said counter-surface (25, 

26), which can be brought into engagement with said 
abutment surface (19) of said conveyor means (4) which is 

directly adjacent in conveying direction (B), said conveyor 
means (4) being pivoted by the co-action of said spreader 

projection (23) and said abutment surface (17) for 
disconnecting said drive connection, and said spring web 

(17) being pressed into contact with said contact surface 
(15).  

 
A conveyor according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 

characterized in
 that there are provided two abutment 
surfaces (19, 22) which are arranged at an angle (α) and 

form a recess, as well as two counter-surfaces (25, 26) 
which are arranged relative to one another at an angle (β) 

and form a spreader projection (23) shaped like a blade, 
said recess formed by said abutment surfaces (19, 22) being 

closer to a center line (7) of said conveyor means (4) by 
an amount (b) than an edge (24) shaped like a blade and 

formed by said counter-surfaces (25, 26) of said spreader 
projection (23). 
A conveyor according to claim 8, 
characterized in
 that 
the height of said spreader projection (23) in conveying 

direction (B) is greater than the depth of the recess 
formed by said abutment surfaces (19, 22) in conveying 

direction (B). 
A conveyor according to claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in
 
that said angle (α) between said abutment surfaces (19, 22) 

is smaller in the relaxed state of spring web (17) than 
said angle (β) between said counter-surfaces (25, 26) of 

said spreader projection (23). 
A conveyor according to any one of claims 7 to 10, 

characterized in
 that said spring web (17) and said 
spreader projection (239 are each molded onto a plastic 

member (29) to be secured to said conveyor means (4).  
 
A conveyor according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 

characterized in
 that a spreader means (16) is provided at 
each side of said conveyor means (4).
