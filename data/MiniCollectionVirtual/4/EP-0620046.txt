interrupting the transfer of coating material so as 
electrically to isolate the source from the electrostatic 

dispenser, the interrupting means comprising a coupling 
device (20) having first and second coupling members (19,28) 

communicating with the source and the electrostatic 
dispensing device, respectively, the coupling members (19,28) 

engaging to transfer coating material from the source 
through the coupling device, and disengaging so as 

electrically to isolate the source from the electrostatic 
dispenser, characterised in that the coupling device (20) 

comprises means (254,242) for creating a suction at at least one of

thereof, so as substantially to prevent drippage of 
coating material as the coupling members disengage. 
At least one coupling member (19,28) comprises 
a one-way valve (214, 236), the or each 

one-way valve (214, 236) being moved to a valve-open position upon 
engagement of the coupling members to allow coating 

material to flow therethrough and, on disengagement of the 
coupling members (19,28) being moved to a valve-closed position 

to prevent the flow of coating material therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a divisional application of 
European Patent Application No. 0467626. This invention relates to electrostatic spray 
coating, and, more particularly, to an apparatus for 
electrostatically isolating a source of supply of 
conductive coating materials such as water-based paint 
from electrostatic coating dispensers, and for pumping 
such coating materials between the source and dispenser. Electrostatic spraying techniques have been used 
in industry for many years. Typically, the coating 
material is discharged in atomised form, and an 
electrostatic charge is imparted to the atomised particles 
which are then directed toward a substrate maintained at 
a different potential to establish an electrostatic 
attraction for the charged atomised particles. In the 
past, coating materials of the solvent-based variety, such 
as varnishes, lacquers, enamels, and the like, were the 
primary materials employed in electrostatic coating 
applications. The problem with such coating materials is 
that they create an atmosphere which is both explosive and 
toxic. The explosive nature of the environment presents 
a safety hazard should a spark inadvertently be generated, 
such as by accidentally grounding the nozzle of the spray 
gun, which can ignite the solvent in the atmosphere 
causing an explosion. The toxic nature of the workplace 
atmosphere created by solvent coating materials can be a 
health hazard should an employee inhale solvent vapours. The use of water-based coatings reduces the 
problems of explosiveness and toxicity. Unfortunately, 
the switch from electrostatically spraying solvent-based 
coatings to water-based coatings has sharply increased the 
risk of electrical shock, which risk was relatively minor 
with solvent-based coatings. The risk of electric shock 
with water-based coatings is due to their extreme 
electrical conductivity, with  
 
resistivities of such water-based coatings often falling 
within the range of 100 to 10,000 ohm centimetres. This 
is in contrast to resistivities of 200,000 to 100,000,000 
ohm centimetres for moderately electrically conductive 
coatings such as metallic paint, and resistivities 
exceeding 100,000,000 ohm centimetres for solvent-based 
lacquers, varnishes, enamels and the like. The relative resistivity of the coating material 
is critical to the potential electrical shock which may 
arise during an electrostatic coating operation. With 
coating materials which are either not electrically 
conductive or only moderately electrically conductive,
