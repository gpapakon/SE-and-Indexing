<ABSTRACT>
Laser light from LD (laser diode) is guided 
through a fiber to be projected onto a reflector. A 

receiver detects a return beam of modulated light 
reflected by the object and outputs a signal 

reflecting a phase difference between the laser light 
and the modulation signal. The frequency of the 

modulation signal is changed based on the signal value 
so as to finally achieve phase lock. When the phase 

lock fixes the frequency of the modulation signal, the 
frequency always corresponds to a distance from LD to 

the reflector or a group index of a substance filling 
the optical path. Thus, the distance to the object or 

the group index of the substance filling the optical 
path at the time of phase lock can be determined in a 

simple manner and with a high accuracy, based on the 
outpu
t frequency at the time of phase lock.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
measuring apparatus. Such a measuring apparatus can be
used for example for accurately measuring a distance to a
target object or a group index of an optical path, using
optical techniques.One example of a conventional rangefinder is an
ultrasonic rangefinder, which cannot present high-accuracy
results but a rough guide. That is, a problem
with an ultrasonic rangefinder is that a measuring
position can not be finely determined, because there are
difficulties in fully converting a beam and specifying a
beam-focused position. Another problem is the inability
to achieve a satisfactory measurement accuracy, because
the temperature dependence of the measurement was great.An example of an optical rangefinder is an electro-optical
rangefinder that uses a phase-difference method,
in which the intensity of signal light is modulated by a
sine wave or the like, the signal light is projected onto
a target object, a phase of the modulation signal between
transmission and reception is measured from a sinusoidal
intensity change of reflected light, and a distance is
determined based on the phase. Such a rangefinder,
however, has the problem that the circuit system therefor
is complex and expensive.An electro-optical rangefinder that uses the phase-difference 
method can also be used as a group index meter
in which the intensity of signal light is modulated by a
sine wave or the like, the signal light is projected onto
a reflector grounded at a known distance, a phase of the
modulation signal between transmission and reception is
measured from a sinusoidal intensity change of reflected
light, and a group index of a substance filling the
optical path is determined based on the phase. This type
of rangefinder, however, also suffers from the problem
that the circuit system therefor is complex and
expensive.Research Disclosure No. 252, April 1985, pages 187-189
(D1) describes several different range finder
circuits in which a photosensor is connected to a
multiplier via a high pass filter and a limiting
amplifier.The present invention aims to solve the above
problems. The present invention aims to provide an
optical measuring apparatus for measuring a distance to a
target object in a simple manner and with a high
accuracy.The present invention also aims to provide an
optical measuring apparatus for measuring a group index
of an optical path in a simple manner and with a high
accuracy.According to the invention there is provided an
