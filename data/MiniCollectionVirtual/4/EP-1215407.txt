<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sleeve bearing arrangement using a new
material, and more particularly, the invention provides a maintenance-free
sleeve bearing that does not require resupply of oil during operation. At the
same time, it is an object of the invention to provide a sleeve bearing using a
high-tech eco-material (state-of-the-art material excellent in ecological
adaptability) obtained from biomass type resources, different from
conventional industrial material.In the past, sleeve bearings made of resin such as polyacetal,
polyamide, etc. have been in use for rotating parts which are light in weight
and slow in rotation speed because such sleeve bearings are available at a
low cost in comparison with sleeve bearings made of metal.However, as a lubricating oil is required between a shaft and a sleeve
bearing, a method of lengthening a service life of the sleeve bearing has been
under study. There are available various methods such as a method of
increasing an mount of oil by increasing a volume of a shaft impregnated
with oil, a method of replenishing oil by providing an oil pan, a method of
preventing spilling of oil by devising an oil seal, and so forth. However, any
of these methods has both merits and demerits, and there is room left for
improvement.The inventor of the present invention has conducted intense studies,
and found out that a porous material is obtained by a process comprising the
steps of mixing degreased bran derived from rice bran with a thermosetting
resin before kneading, subjecting a kneaded mixture to a primary firing in
an inert gas at a temperature in a range of 700 to 1000°C, pulverizing the
kneaded mixture obtained after the primary firing into carbonized powders
sieved through mesh 100, mixing the carbonized powders with a 
thermosetting resin before kneading, pressure-forming a kneaded mixture
thus obtained at a pressure in a range of 20 to 30 MPa, and applying a heat
treatment again to a formed kneaded mixture in the inert gas at a
temperature in a range of 100 to 1100°C, and the porous material thus
obtained (referred to hereinafter as CRB ceramics) has ideal characteristics
as material suitable for use in sleeve bearings.Further, it has been found that the CRB ceramics described above are
insusceptible to damage, light in weight, and has a long service life, having
in addition ability to retain oil and grease for a long period of time. It has
also been found that the porous material has not only the ideal
characteristics as the material suitable for use in the
