<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a long distance optical transmission system comprising transmitting means (1) and pulse receiving means (2) and an optical line (3) extending between said transmission and reception means and comprising alternating sections (3a, 3b) of sign dispersion fibres with opposite chromatic dispersion, and a plurality of amplifiers (4). The invention is characterised in that the optical line includes several pairs of sign dispersion fibre sections with opposite chromatic dispersion between two amplifiers, and the cumulated dispersion C of the majority of the sections of the optical line verifies the relationship |C|  DELTA  nu 
<

>
<
0.3 wherein C is expressed in ps/nm and wherein  DELTA  nu  is the spectral value at mid-height of the pulses expressed in THz.
