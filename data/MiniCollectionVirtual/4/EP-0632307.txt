<ABSTRACT>
A progressive power lens comprising, along a 
principal meridional curve dividing a lens refracting 

surface into a nasal side region and a temporal side 
region, a portion for distant vision having a 

refracting power corresponding to a distant view, a 
portion for near vision having a refracting power 

corresponding to a near view and an intermediate 
portion, located between the portion for distant vision 

and the portion for near vision, for continuously 
connecting the refracting powers of the portions for 

distant and near vision, wherein the principal 
meridional curve is displaced with respect to a 

vertical direction in the state with the lens worn 
toward the nasal side in the intermediate portion and 

the portion for near vision, and an astigmatic 
difference distribution in a horizontal direction in 

the worn state is symmetrical with respect to the 
principal meridional curve in the intermediate portion 

and asymmetrical with respect to the principal 
meridional curve in the portion for near vision.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a progressive
power lens used to assist an accommodation power of an
eye.As spectacle lenses for assisting an accommodation
power when an accommodation power of an eye becomes too
weak to see a near point, various progressive power
lenses have been known. Such a progressive power lens
has a distant vision correcting region (referred to as
a "portion for distant vision" hereinafter), a lower
near vision correcting region (referred to as a
"portion for near vision" hereinafter) and a
progressive region (referred to as an "intermediate
portion" hereinafter) located between the above upper
and lower portions in which a refracting power is
continuously changed. When worn by a user, the portion
for distant vision is located above the portion for
near vision. In the present invention, it is to be
noted that "upper", "lower", "horizontal" and
"vertical" are used to point positions of the
progressive power lens in the state that it is actually
worn by a user. For example, the lower portion of the
portion for distant vision is a position within the 
portion for distant vision close to the intermediate
portion. Also, the difference between the refracting
power of the portion for near vision and the refracting
power of the portion for distant vision is called an
additional power.In a progressive power lens of this type, in
general, when wide clear vision areas of the portions
for near and distant vision are kept and coupled by the
progressive power range, lens aberrations are
concentrated on side areas of the progressive power
range. As a result, blurring and distortion of an
image occur in these side areas. Therefore, when a
user wears spectacles formed of these power lenses and
shifts his eyes laterally, he perceives the distortion
of an image as the fluctuation of the image and has an
unpleasant feeling.In order to solve such a problem of visual
characteristics, in known progressive power lenses,
various designs and evaluations have been made from a
variety of viewpoints.Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view showing the
divisions of regions of a progressive power lens
designed symmetrically. The progressive power lens
has, in the state with it worn by a user, an upper
portion F for distant vision, a lower portion N for
near vision and an intermediate portion P in which the
refracting power is changed continuously between the 
upper and lower portions F and N. As for the shape of
a lens surface, the intersecting curve MM' of the
object-side lens surface and a cross section along a
meridi

A progressive power lens comprising, along a principal meridional curve
(MM') dividing a lens refractive surface into a nasal side region and a

temporal side region, a portion (F) for distant vision having a refracting
power corresponding to a distant view, a portion (N) for near vision having

a refracting power corresponding to a near view and an intermediate portion
(P), located between said two portions (F, N), for continuously connecting

the refracting powers of said portions (F, N), wherein the principal
meridional curve (MM') passes through the geometric center (OG), the

center for distant vision (OF) and the center for near vision (ON) of the lens,
and wherein the center for near vision (ON) is nasally displaced with respect

to the principal meridional curve (M,M') in the distant vision portion (F);

characterized in that

the astigmatism distribution in a direction being horizontal in the worn state
of the lens is approximately symmetrical with respect to the principal

meridional curve (MM') in the intermediate portion (P) and asymmetrical
with respect to the principal meridional curve (MM') in the portion (N) for

near vision, wherein approximately symmetrical means that the maximum
difference of the absolute astigmatisms of points spaced away the same

distance from the meridional curve in the horizontal direction is 0.13 dpt.
The lens according to claim 1, wherein

the portions of the principal meridional curve in the near vision portion (N)
and in the intermediate vision portion (P) are inclined differently. 
The lens according to claim 1, wherein

the portions of the principal meridional curve in the near vision portion (N)
and in the intermediate vision portion (P) extend in the same direction.
The lens according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein

a clear vision area of the portion (N) for near vision is wider on the temporal
side than on the nasal side, wherein a clear vision area is an area including

the principal meridional curve sandwiched by the isoastigmatic difference
curves of 0.5 dpt.
The lens according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein

the astigmatism distribution is asymmetrical with respect to the principal
meridional curve (MM') in the portion (F) for distant vision.
The lens according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein

a clear vision area of the portion (F) for distant vision is wider on the
temporal side than on the nasal side, wherein a clear vision area is an area

including the principal meridional curve sandwiched by the isoastigmatic
difference curves of 0.5 diopter.
