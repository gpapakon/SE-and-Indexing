<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fixing device for securing 
elongate articles such as conduits to support structures, in 
particular cableways/cable risers, and of the kind that is 
disclosed in the preamble of the independent claim 1 
hereinbelow. When mounting elongate articles such as conduits on underlying 
support structures such as cableways and cable risers, in 
structures at sea and on land, the conduits are secured and 
held in place by means of conduit clamps. In their simplest 
form, such clamps consist of a u-shaped body attached by the 
side edge at the bottom of the U-opening to the support 
structure by means of screws and nuts or by means of hooks 
which are brought into engagement with holes, slots or edges 
in the support structure. Conduit clamps of this kind ought to be easy to mount to the 
underlying support structure and also ought to be easy to 
release to enable a change in position or the removal of the 
clamps to be carried out during the relaying of pipelines or 
the moving thereof, and optionally for installing cables which 
require other fixing devices. The objective of the present invention is thus to provide a 
fixing device in the form of a clamp which firstly can easily 
be adapted to different conduit dimensions 
like the fixing device diclosed by DE-A-3 511 265 and where the 
securement and release of the conduit are such that the 
objective of providing a clamp which is easy to mount on the 
support structure and is also easy to dismount therefrom is 
attained. The above desired objectives are, according to the invention, 
fulfilled by means of the characteristic features which are  
 
disclosed in the characterizing clause in independent claim 1 
hereinbelow and also in the subsequent dependent claims. The invention will be explained in more detail hereinbelow with 
reference to the drawing which illustrates an exemplary 
embodiment of the fixing device according to the invention and 
which also shows how said device is mounted and how the conduit 
is positioned in the clamp of the fixing device. Reference is now made to the drawing wherein: Figure 1 is a perspective view of the fixing device seen at an 
angle from above with the jaw and the ratchet arm taken apart 
from one another and with the resilient movable attaching 
member locked in the engagement position by means of an 
eccentric member turned to the closure position by means of an 
operating arm, said operating arm also being indicated in 
dotted lines with the eccentric member in the passive position.
