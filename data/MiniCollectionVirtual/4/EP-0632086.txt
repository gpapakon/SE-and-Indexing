<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a semiconducting material 
comprises reacting one or more of halogenosilanes with 

an alkali metal and/or an alkaline earth metal in an 
inert solvent to give a condensate and thermally 

decomposing the condensate. The condensate is dissolved 
in a suitable solvent such as toluene and 

tetrahydrofuran and applied by casting to a suitable 
substrate. The resulting semiconductor material in its 

film form has an optical band-gap (EO) of usually 
0.1-4.0 eV.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing a
semiconducting material for use in the formation of
diodes, transistors, field effect transistors,
thyristors and like semiconductor elements.A gas-phase crystal growth procedure has found
extensive use in the production of thin films of
amorphous silicone or compound semiconductors in which
their low molecular weight feedstock in gaseous phase is
thermally decomposed or chemically reacted in high
vacuum to deposit on a substrate. This method however
would involve prohibitive costs to reduce to practice
for making large semiconductor films because there will
be required large-scale vacuum devices on one hand and
there is a limitation imposed upon the rate of film
deposition on the other.With the foregoing drawbacks of the prior art in
view, the present invention seeks to provide an improved
method of producing semiconducting materials at a
maximum rate of efficiency and a minimum of costs. JP-A-05 025 281 describes a process for producing an organo-silicon
polymer useful for forming SiC precursors. The
process involves subjecting methylphenyldichlorosilane and
n-butyltrichlorosilane to a desalting reaction by the action
of metallic sodium. JP-A-05 025 282 is directed to a similar
process to that described in JP-A-05 025 281 the difference
lying in the reactants used in the process; methylphenyldichlorosilane
and phenyltrichlorosilane.DE-A-4 110 917 discloses a thermal treatment for producing
silicon carbide from a polysilane. The described process is
concerned with the use of certain metals as catalysts using
temperatures in excess of 800 degrees Celcius.EP-A-0 445 306 discloses the reaction of halosilanes
with alkali metals at 100°C to prepare a
polysilane composition useful as an organic semi-conductor. According to the invention there is provided a method of
producing a semiconducting material which is characterized by
reacting one or more halogenosilanes of the group consisting
of :
   halogenomonosilanes of the formula

   wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from the
group consisting of X, secondary alkyl, tertiary alkyl and
cycloalkyl groups having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, primary,
secondary and tertiary aralkyl groups having from 8 to 12
carbon atoms and silyl groups having the formula:
R3 R4 R5 Si--
   wherein R3, R4 and R5 are independently selectd from the
group consisting of alkyl groups having up to 8 carbon atoms
and aryl groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms and X which
is chlorine, bromine or iodine,
   halogenodisilanes
