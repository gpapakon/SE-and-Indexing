<ABSTRACT>
A floor box (16) for providing electrical terminals in an 
underfloor cabling system comprises a box frame (20) for 

mounting in an aperture (14) in the floor and a carpet frame 
and lid assembly, the box frame having a retractable blade (30, 

130) at each corner for engaging under the edges of the 
aperture (14). Each blade (30) may have a serrated ramp 

surface, and is preferably biassed outwardly by a tension 
spring (102). A top blade (160) may be attached above each 

main blade to raise the level of the ramp in order to 
accommodate thin floors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to floor boxes, and more especially 
electrical outlet boxes which provide electrical terminals in 
an underfloor cabling system and to which flying leads can be 
connected from above floor telephones, electrical equipment, 
computers and the like. Mountings for floor boxes basically comprise a box frame for 
securing the box to the edge of an opening in the floor, and 
a carpet frame and lid assembly which holds down the edge of 
the carpet around the floor opening. Both the box frame and 
the carpet frame and lid assembly require to be secured to the 
floor and there exist several known arrangements for this 
purpose. Tn one arrangement, the box frame fixes to the floor 
and has an internal projecting flange to which an inner edge 
of the carpet frame beneath the lid secures by fixing screws. 
In another arrangement, in which the carpet frame and box frame 
are integrally connected, the box frame carries a member which 
engages the underside of the floor, and the carpet frame screw 
fixes to this member to clamp the entire assembly in position. 
Another recent proposal is to replace the fixing screw of the 
first-mentioned arrangement by a ratchet mechanism. In NL-A-8801336 there is disclosed a floor box of a type having 
a frame unit constituted by an integral or interconnected box 
frame and a carpet frame and lid assembly, wherein the box 
frame carries a plurality of retractable fingers which in use 
engage beneath the floor at the edge of the floor box opening 
to clamp the frame unit in position. Such a floor box is 
hereinafter referred to as a floor box of the type described.  
 It is an object of the invention to provide an improved a floor 
box of the type described which enables the box to be more 
easily and quickly mounted in a floor opening. According to the invention, there is provided a floor box of 
the type described characterised in that the fingers comprise 
blades slidable along a wall of the box frame. The blades are preferably spring urged outwardly of the box 
frame to engage beneath the floor, and are manually retractable 
from the extended position. When a floor box is mounted in position, it is generally 
necessary for the mounting to be adaptable to different 
thicknesses of carpet or other floor covering. In the known 
arrangements, this adaptability is catered for by the fixing 
screws or the ratchet mechanism, or by adjustability of the 
clamp member on the box frame. In accordance with a preferred feature of the present 
invention, the blades, at

<CLAIMS>
A floor box having a frame unit constituted by an integral 
or interconnected box frame (20) and a carpet frame and lid 

assembly (18), wherein the box frame carries a plurality 
of retractable fingers (26) which in use engage beneath the 

floor (10) at the edge of the floor box opening to clamp the 
frame unit in position, characterised in that the fingers 

comprise blades (26) slidable along a wall (32) of the box 
frame. 
A floor box according to claim 1 in which the blades (26) 
are spring urged outwardly of the box frame to engage beneath 

the floor, and are manually retractable from the extended 
position. 
A floor box according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the 
blades, at the regions thereof which engage under the floor, 

have a tapered surface (30), preferably a serrated ramp (162). 
A floor box according to any one preceding claim in which 
four blades (26) are provided, one adjacent each corner of the 

box frame. 
A floor box according to any one preceding claim in which 
each blade (26) is provided with a tension spring (102) which 

independently biasses the blade outwardly of the box frame 
(20). 
A floor box according to any one of claims 3 to 5, in which 
a separate top blade (160) is attachable over each main blade 

(126), the top blade having a similar tapered surface and being 
engageable over the main blade so as effectively to raise the 

level of the ramp.  
 
A floor box according to any one of claims 2 to 6, in which 
the blades are latchable in the retracted position by a pawl 

(35) and detent (40) device provided between the box frame and 
each blade. 
A floor box according to claim 7 in which each blade has 
a partially severed portion bent out to act as the pawl (35) 

which latches into a detent aperture (40) in the wall of the 
box frame. 
A floor box according to any one of claims 2 to 8 in which 
the blades (30) are disposed in two pairs of opposed blades, 

and a cover (41) is provided for the blades which also acts as 
a spring retainer, the blade of each pair being biassed 

outwardly by a single compression spring acting between them.
