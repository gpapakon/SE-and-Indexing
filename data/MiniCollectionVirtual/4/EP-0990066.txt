<ABSTRACT>
Articles especially adapted for in-home dry cleaning comprise a carrier sheet which is impregnated with a cleaning composition. The articles are designed to be rolled for packaging, and to be unrolled for use. Rolling the articles help maintain them in an open configuration especially during use in a hot-air clothes dryer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ROLLED DRY CLEANING ARTICLEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to cleaning articles which are especially adapted for use in appliances such as laundry dryers.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBy classical definition, the term "dry cleaning" has been used to describe processes for cleaning textiles using nonaqueous solvents. Dry cleaning is an old art, with solvent cleaning first being recorded in the United Kingdom in the 1860's. Typically, dry cleaning processes are used with garments such as woolens which are subject to shrinkage in aqueous laundering baths, or which are judged to be too valuable or too delicate to subject to aqueous laundering processes. Various hydrocarbon and halocarbon solvents have traditionally been used in immersion dry cleaning processes, and the need to handle and reclaim such solvents has mainly restricted the practice of conventional dry cleaning to commercial establishments.Together with the soil and stain removal aspects of a typical dry cleaning process, there is also a consumer need for what can be termed fabric "refreshment". Thus, garments which have lint, hair or other solid debris clinging to their surfaces, or which may have adsorbed malodors, or which have become wrinkled or otherwise lost their fresh appearance, are often subjected to conventional commercial dry cleaning processes mainly to reestablish their freshness aspect.Attempts have been made to provide in-home dry cleaning systems. One type of non-immersion, in-home system for cleaning and refreshing garments comprises multiple single-use carrier sheets containing various liquid or gelled cleaning agents and a re-usable plastic containment bag. The garments are placed in the bag together with a sheet, and then tumbled with heating in a conventional clothes dryer. In one embodiment of such in-home products, multiple single-use sheets and a single multi- use plastic bag are provided in a single package. Since the planar sheets are relatively large, they are folded for ease-of-packaging. In use, a planar-folded sheet is unfolded, placed in the reusable bag together with the fabrics to be cleaned, and tumbled in a conventional hot air clothes dryer. During the heating/tumbling, the cleaning composition is released from the sheet. Such release is most efficiently achieved when the sheet remains in a substantially open, unfolded configuration. Unfortunately, it has been discovered that such sheets have a tendency to partially or completely re-close by re-folding along the "hard" creases which comprise
