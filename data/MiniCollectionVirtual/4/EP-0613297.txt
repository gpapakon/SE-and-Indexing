<ABSTRACT>
A signal processing system for a high 
resolution digital video tape recorder (VTR) includes 

circuitry which processes the high resolution video 
signal to produce a relatively low resolution video 

signal which may be recorded on the tape with the high 
resolution video signal. The low resolution video signal 

is encoded using intra-frame techniques and recorded in 
fixed-length segments which appear at predetermined 

locations in the tape tracks. Low resolution segments 
representing images in different frames may be recovered 

and combined to produce an image which is suitable for 
display in trick-play modes. During normal play modes, 

the data stream representing the high resolution image is 
recovered in sequence. Accordingly, this high resolution 

image may be encoded using predictive coding techniques 
as well as intra-frame techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video tape
recorder for recording high definition television (HDTV)
signals and in particular to a recorder which records
motion compensated compressed high definition television
signals and yet allows trick-play features such as
viewing during fast-forward and reverse.Digital high definition television production
schemes have been under development for several years.
These schemes typically produce higher quality television
images and sound than conventional television systems.
To do this, these systems convey more information than is
conveyed in a conventional television signal.Recent regulations issued by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), however, require that
this larger amount of information be sent within the same
band of frequencies as a conventional television signal. 
To fit the relatively large band width High Definition
Television (HDTV) signal into a standard television
channel, the information content of the HDTV signal must
be compressed.Because of the relatively large degree of
spatial redundancy and temporal redundancy in the HDTV
signals, relatively high levels of data compression can
be achieved in most television signals.One method by which spatial redundancy is
removed from a television signal is to generate a
discrete cosine transform representation of the image.
This representation resolves an image frame into
coefficient values representing its various spatial
frequency components. Portions of an image which are the
same from pixel to pixel or which exhibit a repetitive
pattern are resolved from many pixel values to a
relatively small number of frequency coefficient values.
In addition, since the human eye is less sensitive to
quantization errors in image components having high
spatial frequencies than in image components having
relatively low spatial frequencies, the high spatial
frequency coefficients may be coarsely quantized to
further reduce the amount of data used to represent the
image.Temporal redundancy in an image is removed by
encoding only the areas of a given frame which are
different from corresponding areas of a previously
encoded frame. This is generally known as predictive
coding. Temporal redundancy can be further exploited to
achieve even higher levels of data compression by
performing motion compensation. Using this scheme,
before a image block is encoded, the blocks surrounding
it in a previously encoded frame are searched for one
block which most closely matches the block in the current
frame. The current block is
