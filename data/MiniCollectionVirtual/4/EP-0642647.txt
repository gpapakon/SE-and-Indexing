<ABSTRACT>
The hot and polluted gas issued from a thermal reactor (10) including a combustion and supplied with combustive air are introduced into a filter (20) and scrubbed before going back to the atmosphere. A mass and heat exchange is effected in an exchanger (150) between, on the one hand, the hot and filtered gas, and on the other hand, the air taken from the atmosphere so as to recycle the residual enthalpy contained in the filtered and scrubbed hot gas, in the form of hot and very damp air intended to form at least one portion of the combustive air introduced through a line (154) into the reactor (10). The exchanger (150) provides for the rejection to the atmosphere through an outlet conduit (152) of relatively dry combustion gas having a temperature slightly higher than that of the ambient temperature. Application particularly to a reactor for the treatment of waste materials.

Process for the treatment of hot and polluted
gases output by a thermal reactor (10) for the treatment

of waste which includes a combustion and is supplied with
combustion air, in which the hot gases output by the

reactor (10) are filtered and then the filtered hot gases
are scrubbed before they are discharged into the atmosphere,

   characterized in that the filtered hot gases are
scrubbed by making them pass through a scrubber-condenser

stage (157) of a water-vapour pump while the combustion
air is introduced into a scrubber-evaporator stage (156)

of the said water-vapour pump in order to preheat and
humidify this combustion air before its entry into the

thermal reactor so that the operations of scrubbing the
filtered hot gases and of mass and heat exchange between

the filtered and scrubbed hot gases and the air taken
from the atmosphere are thus combined, the residual

enthalpy contained in the filtered and scrubbed hot gases
being recycled in the form of very wet hot air intended

to constitute at least part of the said combustion air,
and the combustion gases discharged into the atmosphere

being relatively dry and having a temperature barely
greater than that of the ambient temperature, and in that

water is collected at the bottom part of the scrubber-condenser
stage (157) of the water-vapour pump, this

water passing through an exchanger (60) where it gives up
some of its heat to an external utilization circuit

before being introduced into the top part of the
scrubber-evaporator stage (156) of the water-vapour pump 

in order to preheat and humidify the combustion air.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, for the scrubbing operation, water is used which is

subjected to a treatment process before its discharge to
the outside.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that, for the scrubbing operation, water

is used which is subjected, before the scrubbing operation,
to a preheat by heat exchange with scrubbing water

which has already served for a scrubbing operation.
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that, for the scrubbing operation, recycled water is

used which is subjected to a treatment process and then
to a preheat, by heat exchange with scrubbing water which

has already served for a scrubbing operation and has
already given rise to a first heat recovery by heat

exchange with a heating system located near the
reactor (10).
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the air taken from the atmosphere is introduced into

a first chamber (156) constituting the said scrubber-evaporator
stage, the said air is humidified and

preheated in the said first chamber (156) by means of
preheated water introduced into the said first

chamber (156), the air heated and highly laden with water
vapour in the first chamber (156) is used as combustion

air for the thermal reactor (10), the cold water which
has served for scrubbing the air in the first

chamber (156) is introduced into a second chamber (157)
constituting the said scrubber-condenser stage, in order

to constitute the water for scrubbing the filtered hot
gases, which are also introduced into the second

chamber (157), to be subjected to an operation of scrubbing
and of condensing the water vapour contained in the

said filtered hot gases, and, on the one hand, the
relatively dry combustion gases which are discharged into

the atmosphere and, on the other hand, the water formed
in the second chamber (157) which is itself recycled in

order to be introduced into the first chamber (156) are 
extracted from the second chamber (157) so that the

operations of scrubbing the filtered hot gases and of
mass and heat exchange between the filtered hot gases and

the air taken from the atmosphere are combined by the
implementation of a scrubbing-evaporation operation

applied in the first chamber (156) to the air taken from
the atmosphere and of a scrubbing-condensation oper
ation
applied in the second chamber (157) to the filtered

combustion gases.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the filtered hot gases subjected to

the scrubbing operation have a temperature of about 200
to 300°C, in that the air taken from the atmosphere has

a temperature of about 15 to 25°C, in that the water
serving for the scrubbing operation is introduced at a

temperature of about 45 to 55°C and in that the water
which has served for the scrubbing operation is removed

at a temperature of about 65 to 75°C, allowing heat
recovery by heat exchange with a heating system located

near the reactor (10).
