<ABSTRACT>
Device and its use for the melt-spinning of multifilament yarns from thread-forming polymers at winding speeds of at least 2000 m/min by means of a spinneret, a cooling device for consolidating the threads, a combining member for the filaments and a winding apparatus, an essentially vertical spinning line being provided at least between the nozzle and combining member, the cooling device being a porous tube open in the spinning direction and arranged concentrically relative to the spinning line, and the porous tube being neither preceded nor followed by any further devices feeding or discharging a cooling medium, characterised in that the porous tube is followed by a further non-porous tube. It has proved particularly expedient, at the same time, if the porous tube has a length of 10 to 800 mm. A length of 200 to 800 mm has been shown to be especially advantageous for the further non-porous tube following the porous tube.

Device for the melt spinning of multifilament yarns 
from yarn-forming polymers at winding speeds of at 

least 2000 m/min, having a spinneret, a cooling device 
for stabilizing the yarns, a combining element for the 

filaments and a take-up device, a substantially 
vertical spinning line being provided at least between 

spinneret and first combining element, the cooling 
device being a porous tube open in spinning direction 

and disposed concentrically relative to the spinning 
line, and there being no further devices for supplying 

or discharging a cooling medium disposed upstream or 
downstream of the porous tube, characterized in that a 

further, non-porous tube is disposed downstream of the 
porous tube. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
further, non-porous tube is formed by a cover disposed 

on the porous tube. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
an up to 300 mm long device, which prevents cooling of 

the filaments and which the porous tube adjoins, is 
disposed directly below the spinneret. 
Device according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the porous tube has a length of 

10 to 800 mm. 
Device according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the further, non-porous tube 

disposed downstream of the porous tube has a length of 
200 to 800 mm.  

 
Use of the device according to one or more of claims 1 
to 5 for manufacturing filament yarns, the filament 

yarns being wound at speeds of up to 10,000 m/min. 
Use according to claim 6, the filament yarns being made 
of polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polyamide 6, 

polyamide 6.6, their copolymers or mixtures of said 
polymers. 
Use of the device according to one or more of claims 1 
to 5 for manufacturing polyester filament yarns, the 

polyester filament yarns being wound at speeds of up to 
10,000 m/min. 
Use of the device according to one or more of claims 1 
to 5 for manufacturing polyester roving yarns, the 

polyester roving yarns being wound at speeds of 2000 to 
6000 m/min. 
Use of the device according to one or more of claims 1 
to 5 for manufacturing filament yarns, the filament 

yarns being wound at speeds of 2000 to 8000 m/min, 
whereby the filaments of the filament yarns have a 

filament titre of 0.1 to 6 dtex.
