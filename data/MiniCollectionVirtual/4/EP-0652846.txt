<ABSTRACT>
There is described a trolley (20) comprising a frame (22), at least four wheels (21) coupled to the frame for movement of the trolley (20) along a bearing girder (30), and a winch drum (30) rotatably mounted in the frame (22), around which a hoist rope or hoist chain (65) is wound. This trolley (20) is improved in that the winch drum (60) is provided with a helical groove for receiving the hoist rope (65), and in that a hold-down roller (70) is arranged along the winch drum (60) for holding down the hoist rope (65) in the grooves of the winch drum (60). As a result, it is accomplished that the trolley (20), at a constant or event increased hoisting capacity, can be reduced in a vertical direction so that a cargo vehicle can be loaded more efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a trolley comprising a frame; at 
least four wheels coupled to the frame for movement of the 
trolley along a bearing girder; and hoist means carried by the 
frame. Such a trolley is known in practice and is used for 
displacing objects along the bearing girder. The trolley used in practice is quite satisfactory in 
locations where sufficient height is present, such as, for 
instance, in constructional shops. An object to be displaced 
is lifted to a desired height by the hoist means, displaced 
along the bearing girder, while, possibly, the bearing girder 
itself is in turn displaced at right angles relative to its 
longitudinal direction, until the object has been brought to a 
desired location, whereafter it is lowered by the hoist means. However, the trolley used in practice is less 
satisfactory in places where the available height is limited, 
for instance when used in the loading space of a cargo 
vehicle. Such a use is described in, for instance, British 
patent application 2,105,294. It will be clear that in the 
case of such a trolley, suspended below the bearing girder, 
the maximum accessible height to which an object can be lifted 
is limited. More particularly, the loading space in a cargo 
vehicle wherein such a trolley is applied can then be used up 
to a limited height only, and the objects to be transported in 
this cargo vehicle are limited in height, which is a drawback 
from an economic point of view. French patent specification 1,441,669 discloses a trolley 
of the above-mentioned type, where respectively two front 
wheels and two rear wheels are provided on both sides of the 
frame, the hoist means comprising a winch drum rotatably 
mounted in the frame substantially at the level of the wheels, 
around which a hoist rope or hoist chain is wound. The trolley 
disclosed in the French patent specification 1,441,669 
provides an improvement over the above-mentioned trolley, 
known from practice, insofar as it takes up less space in  
 
vertical direction, so that a cargo vehicle can be loaded more 
efficiently and higher objects can be loaded. The object of the invention is to further improve this 
trolley disclosed in French patent specification 1,441,669. The object of the invention is in particular to provide a 
trolley that allows for a further gain of height. Starting 
from the known trolley, this could in principle be achieved by 
reducing the vertical dimensions thereof, but that implies 
that the diameter of the winch drum is reduced, which is 
irrevoca

that the winch drum (60) extends in the longitudinal direction 

of the trolley (20). 
A trolley according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
winch drum (60) is coupled to a motor (62) mounted in the 

frame (22) in line with the rotary shaft of the winch drum 
(60).

claims, characterized in that the hoist rope (65) is attached 

by a free end (66) to the frame (22), and that a gripping 
element (11), such as a lift eye, can move freely over the  

 
hoist rope portion (67) between said free end (66) and the 

winch drum (60). 
A trolley according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
free end (66) of the hoist rope (65) is attached in the 

vicinity of the top of the frame (22) and that the hoist rope 
(65), viewed from said free end (66), is wound up starting at 

the top of the winch drum (60). 
A trolley according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the front wheels (21) are mounted on a 

common front shaft (41), and that the rear wheels (21) are 
mounted on a common rear shaft (42). 
A trolley according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that there is provided at least one guide 

wheel (43; 44), placed in the frame (22), for guiding the 
hoist rope or hoist chain (45).
