<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method 
for the preparation of geometrical isomers which are important 

as constituents of synthetic pheromones, synthetic perfumes, 
terpenes and the like (i.e., a method for the isomerization of 


cis
-alkenyl compounds to their 
trans
-isomers). In this method, 
the above-described object is accomplished by reacting a 


cis
-alkenyl compound in the presence of nitric acid used as the 
sole catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the preparation of 
geometrical isomers which are important as constituents of 
synthetic pheromones, synthetic perfumes, terpenes and the 
like. More particularly, it relates to a method for the 
isomerization of cis-alkenyl compounds to their trans-isomers. In recent years, the technique of utilizing synthetic sex 
pheromones to predict the breeding of harmful insects or 
disturb communications between harmful insects has made great 
progress for the main purpose of controlling harmful insects of 
the order Lepidoptera. Thus, the utilization of synthetic sex 
pheromones is now in the stage of practical application. Sex pheromones produced by lepidoptera are composed chiefly 
of unsaturated aliphatic compounds, and most of them are 
alkenes and alkadienyl compounds. Moreover, the position of an 
unsaturated bond or bonds in these components, their 
geometrical structure (i.e., cis- or trans-form), and the 
mixing ratio of these components have already been determined. 
The results thus obtained constitute an important factor to be 
considered in the synthesis of sex pheromones.  
 In general it is known to perform processes for the 
isomerization of cis-unsaturated compounds into their trans-isomers 
in the presence of nitric acid. It is believed that 
the following documents, however, do not teach how a high 
degree of isomerization and high selectivity may be obtained 
by using a nitric acid as the sole catalyst:

99:121780g (& Huaxue Xuebao 1983, 41(6), pp.

61-62; Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 86 (1977), Abstract N° 
86:171653v (& JP-A-51113802). Conventionally known techniques for the isomerization of 
cis-isomers to trans-isomers are as follows:  
 An isomerization reaction using a mercapto-containing 
compound or a disulfide as a catalyst is described in Japanese 
Patent Publication Nos. 57608/'87 and 58337/'87. Moreover, an isomerization reaction using elemental selenium 
(Se) as a catalyst is described in Journal of Am. Oil Chem. 
Soc., 26, 83, 1949. Furthermore, an isomerization reaction using a mineral acid 
(e.g., nitrous acid, sulfurous acid or the like) as a catalyst 
and conducted in an organic solvent is described in
