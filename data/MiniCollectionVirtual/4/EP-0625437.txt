<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stud link for tyre chains having a link body (1) which has at least one receiving opening (2; 3) for the connection of connecting links and is provided on the bottom with a face (4) for resting against the tyre and at the top with a ground-side resting face which is formed by the surfaces (9) of the tread bar (5), which surfaces are each bounded, in the longitudinal direction of the link body (1), by essentially transversely running depressions (8). In the case of a stud link of this type, each side wall (6), which leads from one tread bar (5) to the bottom (7) of an adjacent depression (8), runs essentially perpendicularly with respect to the surface (9) of the tread bar (5). At the same time, each depression (8) extends transversely to the longitudinal direction of the link body (1) but only over about half of the width thereof. The bottom (7) of each depression (8) is formed by a flat sloping face which slopes downwards from the central region of the ground-side resting face of the link body (1) up to the point where the depression (8) merges into one of the two longitudinal side faces of the link body (1).
