<ABSTRACT>
A retractable, concealable peripheric gas station for refuelling in particular military vehicles, which is connected to a main station supplying it both with fuel and hydraulic fluid and includes an outer metal tank (10) closed by an upper cover (11) hinged thereto, a metal frame (14) hinged under said cover so as to pivot between a lowered rest position and a raised operating position, a take-up reel (15) for a hose supplying fuel, and a hydraulic assembly (24) operating between the frame and the tank under control of the oleodynamic main station which causes the frame to pivot between the lowered and raised positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refuelling station system 
including peripheral refuelling points 
especially, but not exclusively, suitable for 
delivering fuel to military vehicles. Such a refuelling point is intended to operate together 
with a number of identical refuelling points of protected, 
concealable fuel delivering installations especially, 
but not exclusively, for military plants in which it is 
necessary to carry out the socalled "hot refuelling", 
i.e. delivering fuel at the same time to several 
vehicles with running motors. US-A-2642957 describes a gasoline dispensing 
system having submerged fuel storage tanks and 
distributing piping leading to a number of elevatable 
units normally contained within a submerged pit casing 
having a platform extension movable to a position to 
bridge across the wing of an airplane for fuel 
servicing therof. DE-U-7318246 describes an underground concealable 
fuel dispensing station for aircrafts or motor vehicles 
comprising a hinged cover on which a support for a reel 
of a dispensing hose is secured which is supplied with 
fuel from an underlying storage tank and a pump and 
electric motor unit. The refuelling station system of this invention is defined in 
attached claim 1; preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent 
claims.  
 The peripheric refuelling point according to the 
invention can take on both a rest position because 
of its s tructure described above, in which 
all of the component parts are received into the tank 
as well as protected by the cover plate and concealed, 
and an operative position in which  
 
the cover plate is pivoted and the frame projects upwards 
from the ground so that the hose can be unwound from the 
take-up reel in order to reach the vehicle to be 
refuelled, and the refuelling station can be operated and 
controlled. As mentioned above, the drive system for the peripheric refuelling point is of the 
oleodynamic type and includes a cylinder and piston 
assembly which operates between the hinged frame and the 
wall of the tank. The raising of the frame causes the 
cover plate to pivot, the arrangement being such that the 
station has a reduced height size in the raised position. This invention will now be described more in detail with 
reference to the accompanying drawings which show an 
embodiment of the invention arranged at an airport. In the drawings: 
Fig. 1 is the airport lay-out, in which there are shown 
the fuel tanks, the delivering main station, and four peripheric 
stations according to the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A refuelling station system of the protected and 
concealable type, comprising 


a) a fuel supply source (SS1,SS2); 
b) a main remotely controlled delivering station (CCL) 
including 


an electropump for delivering fuel from said fuel 
supplying source, 
an oleodynamic control unit for delivering hydraulic 
fluid, 
an electric power supply; 
c) a fuel delivering piping network (RRC) to be fed by 
said electropump; 
d) a hydraulic fluid delivering piping network (RF1) to 
be fed by said oleodynamic control unit; 
e) an electric network (REL) connected to said power 
supply; and 
f) several peripheric refuelling points (PPR) connected 
to said main remotely controlled delivering station (CCL) 

trough said fuel delivering piping network (RRC), said 
hydraulic fluid delivering piping network (RF1) and said 

electric network (REL) 
 
characterised in that each peripheric refuelling point 

(PPR) comprises: 

an outer metal tank (10) of a parallelepipedic shape 
received into the ground; 
an upper cover (11) for said tank (10) which is hinged at 
one side thereof; 
a metal frame (14) which is hinged at said side of the 
tank under the hinge (12) of said cover so as to pivot 

between a lowered position, said metal frame and said 
cover being engaged so as to drive the cover to pivoting 

on pivoting of the frame; 
a take-up reel (15) pivotally supported by said metal 
frame and a fuel delivering hose (16) carried by said 

take-up reel in fluid communication with said fuel 
delivering piping network (RRC); a hydraulic motor  

 
(19)for rewinding said take-up reel supported by said 

frame and controlled with the hydraulic fluid supplied 
from said main station through said fluid delivering 

piping network (RRC); 
a cylinder and piston assembly (24) operating between 
said hinged frame and the wall (22) of said tank for 

causing the frame to raise and lower, said cylinder and 
piston assembly being operated by the hydraulic fluid 

delivered by oleodynamic control unit in said main 
remotely controlled delivering station through said fluid 

pipe network (RF1); 
control means for remotely controlling said main 
delivering station through said electric network (REL), 

said electric network consisting of low voltage electric 
lines. 
A refuelling station system as claimed in claim 1, in 
which said low voltage is 24 volt. 
A refuelling station system as claimed in claim 1, in 
which said fuel supplying source (SS1, SS2) is a pipe of 

a fuel piping system or one or more buried tanks.
