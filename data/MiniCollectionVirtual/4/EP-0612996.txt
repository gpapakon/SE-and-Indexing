<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method is provided for identifying a 
diffusely-reflecting material (F), such as a textile fabric. 

A light source (14, 114, 214) transmits radiation onto the 
unknown material, and a detector (24, 124, 224) receives 

radiation diffusely reflected by the unknown material, and 
generates signals indicative of diffuse-reflection 

characteristics of the unknown material. A processor (246) 
is coupled to the detector, and includes diffuse-reflection 

data on a plurality of reference materials. The processor 
(246) compares (342) the diffuse-reflection characteristics 

of the unknown material based on the signals of the detector 
to the reference data, and by a process of elimination, 

identifies the unknown material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods 
and apparatus for optical sensing, and more 
particularly, to such methods and apparatus 
employing infrared, diffuse-reflection 
spectroscopy for sensing and classifying 
diffusely-reflecting materials. There have been various uses of 
spectroscopy for characterizing or understanding 
the make-up of materials. A test technique for 
distinguishing wool from polyester-fibre and 
cotton fabrics employing photoacoustic 
spectroscopy is discussed in the article, Davidson 
and King, "A Method of Distinguishing Wool from 
Polyester-fibre and Cotton Fabrics", J. Text. Inst., 
Vol. 74, p. 382 (1983). This technique  
 
makes use of the absorption spectrum of the fabric 
in the near infrared, which is the complement of 
the reflection spectrum. A major disadvantage of 
the proposed technique is the inability to control 
the resonant cell's sample wall in real-use 
conditions. Another article, Derkson and Monahan, "A 
Reflectometer for Measuring Diffuse Reflectance in 
the Visible and Infrared Regions", J. Opt. Soc. Am., 
Vol. 42, p. 263 (1952), discusses an 
instrument for measuring diffuse reflectance of 
materials, and employs as targets, among other 
things, cotton twill and wool serge. This 
instrument operates in the infrared, and in the 
visible-wavelength range for visual appearance 
purposes. Another instrument is reported by Timo 
Hyvarinen, "Rugged Multiwavelength NIR and IR 
Analyzers For Industrial Process Measurements", 
SPIE Conference Proceedings, Vol. 1266, p. 99 
(1990), European Congress on Optics, The Hague. 
This device is a hand-held, battery-operated meter 
for optically measuring the moisture content of 
peat. A tube is inserted into a peat bog, and a 
trigger is pulled in order to display the moisture 
measurement on a display. This device uses a  
 
miniature tungsten lamp, and a detector including 
two side-by-side lead-sulfide (PbS) 
photoconductive cells located behind interference 
filters peaked at 1.80 and 1.94 microns, the 
useful sensing bands for water. The PbS cells and 
interference filters are mounted in a windowed, 
N₂-filled, hermetically-sealed container, to 
prolong filter life. The light source is 
electrically modulated at 35 Hz and transmitted 
through a quartz window into the peat, and the 
radiation diffusely reflected by the peat is 
measured by the detector, which provides output 
signals indicative of the moisture content of the peat. It would be desirable to provide a method 
and apparatus for identifying unknown 
diffusel
