<ABSTRACT>
A radiation image storage panel, on which a
radiation image has been stored, is exposed to

stimulating rays, which cause it to emit light in
proportion to the amount of energy stored thereon during

its exposure to the radiation. The emitted light is
photoelectrically detected on the front surface side of

the radiation image storage panel, which is the
stimulating ray incidence side, and on the back surface

side, two image signals being thereby obtained. The
image signal components of the two image signals are

added to each other, which represent corresponding
picture elements on the front and back surfaces of the

radiation image storage panel, an addition signal being
thereby obtained. The addition ratio for the two image

signals is changed in accordance with at least a single
factor selected from the group consisting of the dose of

the radiation irradiated to the radiation image storage
panel, the kind of the radiation image storage panel, the

spatial frequency of interest in the radiation image, and
the conditions under which the radiation was irradiated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a superposition
processing method and apparatus for a radiation image,
wherein two image signals, which have been independently
detected from opposite surfaces of a radiation image
storage panel, are superposed one upon the other.It has been proposed to use stimulable
phosphors in radiation image recording and reproducing
systems. Specifically, a radiation image of an object,
such as a human body, is recorded on a sheet provided
with a layer of the stimulable phosphor (hereinafter
referred to as a stimulable phosphor sheet or a radiation
image storage panel). The stimulable phosphor sheet, on
which the radiation image has been stored, is then
scanned with stimulating rays, such as a laser beam,
which cause it to emit light in proportion to the amount
of energy stored thereon during its exposure to the
radiation. The light emitted by the stimulable phosphor
sheet, upon stimulation thereof, is photoelectrically
detected and converted into an electric image signal.
The image signal is then processed and used for the
reproduction of the radiation image of the object as a
visible image on a recording material. Techniques for carrying out superposition
processing on radiation images have heretofore been
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,356,398. In
general, radiation images are used for diagnoses of
illnesses and for other purposes. When a radiation image
is used for such purposes, it is required that even small
differences in the radiation energy absorption
characteristics among structures of an object can be
detected accurately in the radiation image. The extent,
to which such differences in the radiation energy
absorption characteristics can be detected in a radiation
image, is referred to as the contrast detection
performance or simply as the detection performance. A
radiation image having better detection performance has
better image quality and can serve as a more effective
tool in, particularly, the efficient and accurate
diagnosis of an illness. Therefore, in order for the
image quality to be improved, it is desirable that the
detection performance of the radiation image may be
enhanced. Practically, the detection performance is
adversely affected by various noises.For example, in radiation image recording and
reproducing systems using stimulable phosphor sheets, it
has been found that the noises described below occur
during the step for recording a radiation image on a
radiation image storage panel and reading out the
radiation image therefrom.
