<DESCRIPTION>
 SCREENING METHODS FOR IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS This invention was made in the course of work supported by the U.S. Government, which has certain rights in this invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The immune response is coordinated by the actions of cyto ines produced from activated T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes having a broad spectrum of antigen receptors are produced in the thymus as a product of the processes of selection and differentiation. When these T cells migrate to the peripheral lymphoid organs and encounter antigen, they undergo activation, during the process of which they produce large numbers of cytokines that act upon other cells of the immune system to coordinate their behavior to bring about an effective immune response. T lymphocyte activation involves the specific regulation of many genes from minutes after the antigen encounter until at least 10 days later. T cells may also be activated by stimuli such as the combination of a calcium ionophore (e.g., ionomycin) and an activator of protein kinase C, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) . Several lectins, including phytohemagglutinin (PHA) may also be used to activate T cells (Nowell, P.C. (1990) Cancer Res. 20:462-466). The T cell activation genes are roughly grouped based on the time after stimulation at which each gene is regulated. Early genes trigger the regulation of subsequent genes in the activation pathway.Because of the critical role of the T lymphocyte, agents that interfere with the early activation genes, such as cyclosporin A and FK506, are effective immunosuppressants. These early activation genes are regulated by transcription factors, such as NF-AT, that in turn are regulated through interactions with the antigen receptor. These transcription factors act through enhancer and promoter elements on the early activation genes to modulate their rate of transcription. 

 A typical early gene enhancer element is located in the first 325 base pairs upstream of the start site of the interleukin-2 gene. This region has been used extensively to dissect the requirements for T lymphocyte activation. This region binds an array of transcription factors including NF-AT, NFkB, AP-1, Oct-1, and a newly identified protein that associates with Oct-1 called OAP-40. These different transcription factors act together to integrate the complex requirements for T lymphocyte activation. NF-AT appears to be the most important element among the group mentioned above in that it is able to direct transcription of any genes to activated T cells
