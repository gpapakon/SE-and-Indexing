Separating device for sheet laminating machines for
separating the sheet coated with a continuous layer of

film during sheet-by-sheet conveyance by cutting into the
exposed film layer in the peripheral region of the

overlap region by means of a moving blade, characterised
in that at least one, preferably a plurality of tilting

blades (3) with a substantially radial cutting edge (3a)
is pivotably mounted on and distributed equidistantly

over the circumference of a rotary disk (1) engaging
beneath the sheet web (14), which tilting blade can be

lowered by a cam control from a raised position (Fig. 4)
into an operating position sliding upon the sheet web

(14) after passing over the sheet web edge (13) and can
be raised again upon leaving the sheet web, and the

circumferential velocity of the blade section cutting
into the film layer (17) is substantially higher than the

conveying velocity of the sheet web (14).
Separating device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the tilting blades (3) are each

secured at the upper end of a support element (5) which
penetrates the ro
tary disk (1) in a recess (8), is
mounted at its lower end on an axle (7) on the rotary

disk (1) and is provided with a cross arm (9) with a
feeler roller (10), which runs along a fixed cam disk

(11) beneath the rotary disk (1).
Separating device according to claim 2,
characterised in that the support element (5) is

prestressed by a spring (12) into the lowered operative
position of the tilting blade (3).
Separating device according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that ramps (4) for the edge of the sheet 

web (14) are secured to the rotary disk (1) - in front of
the tilting blades (3) in the direction of rotation of

the rotary disk (1).
Separating device according to claim 4,
characterised in that the ramps (4) are arranged on an

outer annular section (1b) of the rotary disk which is
rotatable and releasably lockable relative to the inner

central region (1a) of the rotary disk (1).
Separating device according to claim 4 or 5,
characterised in that the ramps (4) are replaceably

arranged in recesses (20) in the rotary disk (1) with a
sunken front edge (18).
Separating device according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the rotary disk (1) is adjustable

in its height relative to its support section which can
be secured to the sheet conveyor frame.
Separating device according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the rotary disk (1) is adjustable

transversely to the sheet running direction by means of a
hand wheel (21).
Separating device according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised by a direct current motor driving the

rotary disk (1).
