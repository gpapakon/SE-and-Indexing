<CLAIMS>
A supporting arrangement for a vibrating component 
(1), comprising a support (23) which is supported on a 

machine part (24), a bearing mount which is supported on the 
support (23) by a spring body, and an inertia mass (32) 

which can be moved back and forth by a drive parallel to the 
direction of the operationally introduced vibrations, is 

spring-mounted, can be moved in a controlled manner in the 
opposite direction relative to the exciting vibration and is 

connected to the support (23) by means of a spring (28), the 
inertia mass (32) and the spring (28) not being contacted by 

a liquid, characterized in that the inertia mass (32) and 
the spring (28) are held in a housing (33) which is separate 

from the arrangement consisting of the support (23), the 
bearing mount and the spring body. 
A supporting arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the ratio of the respective sizes of 

the inertia mass (32) and the vibrating component (1) is 
from 1/100 to 1/1000. 
A supporting arrangement according to either of 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the housing (33) is 

attached to the side of the machine part (24) remote from 
the support (23). 
A supporting arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the support (23) is a rubber mount.
