<ABSTRACT>
The solenoid valve has a plastic coil former (7) which is arranged within a cylindrical housing shell (10), around which is wound an excitation coil (15) and in the axial through opening (16) of which an armature arrangement (1, 2) is seated. The solenoid valve also has, within a valve seat (9), a spherical valve element (14) which can be actuated by way of the armature arrangement. The valve seat is likewise composed of plastic. The coil former furthermore has an extension (7a), which is formed integrally in the direction of the valve seat and to which the valve seat is welded at the end, e.g. by ultrasonic welding. Advantage: simplicity of construction, reduced production costs.

A solenoid valve having a spherical valve body (14)
disposed inside a valve seat (9) made from plastics and

having a cylindrical housing shell (10) inside which an
exciting coil (15) is wound on a coil shell (7) made from

plastics and is disposed in an axial through-aperture
(16) of the coil shell (7), and wherein the spherical

valve body (14) can be actuated via the armature device
(1, 2),
characterised in that
 the coil shell (7) comprises a
projection (7a) which is moulded on in the direction of

the valve seat (9), to which the valve seat (9) is welded
at the end side.
A solenoid valve according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the valve seat is attached at the
end side to the projection (7a) of the coil shell (7) by

an ultrasonic welded joint.
A solenoid valve according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 disposed between the projection
(7a) of the coil shell (7) and the valve seat (9) is an

annular groove (18) for housing a sealing ring (5).
A solenoid valve according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 disposed on one end side of the
coil shell (7) faced away from the valve seat (9) is a

pole core (8) having a flange-type construction,

in that
 a part of this pole core (8) projects into the
axial through-aperture (16) of the coil shell (7) and

lies opposite the armature device (1, 2),
and in that
 this part of the pole core (8) is provided
with a central aperture (17), inside which a pressure

spring (4) is disposed, by which axial pressure can be 
exerted on the armature device (1, 2) to actuate the

valve body (14).
A solenoid valve according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the armature device (1, 2)
comprises an armature (1) and a stem (2) securely

connected to the armature,

and in that the stem (2) is provided to actuate the
spherical valve body (14).
A solenoid valve according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the coil shell (7) is provided on
its end side faced towards the valve seat (9) with an

annular recess (13), in which an annular protuberance
(19) of the valve seat (9) can be inserted by means of a

snug fit connection.
A solenoid valve according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the valve seat (9) and coil shell
(7) are made from the same plastics material.
A solenoid valve according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 a metal plate (11) is disposed
inside the projection (7a) and the coil shell (7) and

orthogonally to the axial through-aperture (16) of the
coil shell (7),
and in that
 the plate (11) has a diameter which is at
least equal to the external diameter of the exciting coil

(15).
A solenoid valve according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 the plate (11) is a stamped product
or sintered product. 
A solenoid valve according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that
 on one end side faced away
from the valve seat (9) the pole core (8) is

provided with a wall extending up to the cylindrical
housing shell (10),
and in that
 the wall of the pole core (8) forms an
end limitation of the solenoid valve and is

connected to the cylindrical housing shell (10) by
a caulked joint.
