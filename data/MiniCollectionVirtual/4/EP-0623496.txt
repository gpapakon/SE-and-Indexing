A screen wiper (10), especially for a motor 
vehicle, of the type including a screen wiper arm (12) 

which carries at least one wiper blade and which is 
articulated about a pivot axis (X-X, 24), on a drive 

head (16) of the screen wiper arm (12), and including 
at least one spring (17) interposed between the drive 

head (16) and the screen wiper arm, and of the type 
which includes a strut (30) interposed between a 

portion of the upper surface of the body (26) of the 
drive head (16) and a portion (22), in facing 

relationship therewith, of the end portion (14, 18) of 
the screen wiper arm articulated on the drive head 

(16), characterised in that the strut (30) is 
removable, and in that the strut is extended 

longitudinally towards the other end of the screen 
wiper arm by a hooking lug (38, 44), which cooperates 

with a hooking surface (27) formed on the screen wiper 
arm (28, 29). 
A screen wiper according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the hooking lug (38) comprises an elongate 

body, at the end of which a hooking nib (44) is formed. 
A screen wiper according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the elongate body (38) of the hooking lug  

 
includes a laterally projecting portion (42) which lies 

facing the spring (17). 
A screen wiper according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the said end 

portion of the screen wiper arm articulated on the 
drive head has two parallel side elements (20), between 

which the pivot pin (24) extends, and which are joined 
together through a spine (22). 
A screen wiper according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the strut (30) is interposed between the upper 

face of the body (26) of the drive head (16) and the 
inner face of the spine (22) of the end portion of the 

screen wiper arm. 
A screen wiper according to Claim 5 taken in 
combination with Claim 2 or Claim 3, characterised in 

that the elongate body (38) of the hooking lug is in 

the form of a web which extends substantially parallel, 
and along, the internal face of one of the side 

elements (20) of the end portion of the screen wiper 
arm. 
A screen wiper according to Claim 5 taken in 
combination with Claim 3, characterised in that the 

said laterally projecting portion (42) which faces 
towards the spring (17) is disposed between the latter 

and the internal face of the spine (22) of the end 
portion of the screen wiper arm.  

 
A screen wiper according to any one of Claims 4 to 
7, characterised in that the screen wiper arm includes 

an arm body (28) in the form of a flattened bar, which 
extends between the side elements (20) of the said end 

portion of the screen wiper arm, and on the end portion 
of which the said hooking surface (27) for the hooking 

nib (44) of the hooking lug of the strut (30) is 
formed. 
A screen wiper according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the strut (30) 

has a symmetry of design with respect to a median 
longitudinal plane of the drive head and of the screen 

wiper arm. 
A screen wiper according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that it includes two strut portions disposed 

symmetrically with respect to the said median plane 
(P), the said strut portions being joined together 

through a connecting lug (46). 
A screen wiper according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that the connecting lug (46) is 

substantially U-shaped, with each of the side branches 
(48) of the U being joined to one of the hooking lugs, 

the central branch (50) of the U constituting a 
gripping member of the strut. 
A screen wiper according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that the side branches of the  

 
connecting lug extend in a direction substantially at 

right angles to that of the hooking lugs. 
A screen wiper according to any one of Claims 10 
to 12, characterised in that the said spring (17) is a 

helical spring which is received between the internal 
faces, in mutual facing relationship, of the two 

hooking lugs. 
A mounting strut adapted to be fitted on a screen 
wiper in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 13.
