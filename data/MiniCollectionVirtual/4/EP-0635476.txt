<ABSTRACT>
Carbonates containing aromatic ester groups can be prepared by reaction of aromatic monohydroxy compounds with phosgene or with chlorocarbonic acid esters of aromatic monohydroxy compounds, the reaction being carried out at a temperature in the range from 50 to 350 DEG C in the presence of aluminosilicates as heterogeneous catalysts.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing aryl carbonates by reacting 
aromatic monohydroxy compounds with phosgene or 

chloroformates of aromatic monohydroxy compounds, 
characterised in that the reaction is performed at a 

temperature in the range 50-350°C under a pressure of 
0.2 to 20 bar in the presence of one or more 

aluminosilicates as heterogeneous catalysts. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
one or more aluminosilicates selected from the group 

of zeolites of the formula

in which 


M
represents cations such as protons or cations of 
metals from Mendeleev's periodic table of the

 precipitation catalysts are used in an  
 

amount of 0.5-100 wt.%, with reference to the amount 
of monohydroxy compounds, when using a suspended 

catalyst or with loads of 0.1-20 g per g of catalyst 
per hour when using a fixed bed arrangement for the 

catalyst.
