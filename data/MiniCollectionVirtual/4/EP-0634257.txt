<ABSTRACT>
A green body molded in a pressurized slip casting 
machine is loaded onto a pallet and sent down a conveyor. An 

image of the green body is picked up from above by a CCD 
camera, and whether the green body is a rectangular tank or 

a triangular tank is distinguished. When the green body is 
a rectangular tank holes are made in it by a first holemaking 

device, and when the green body is a triangular tank holes 

are made in it by a second holemaking device. After that, 
water removal, shape correction, deburring and the like are 

carried out automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method, employed in the
manufacture of ceramic products such as sanitary earthenware,
of finishing a green ceramic body (hereinafter referred to as a
'green body'), and particularly to a method of finishing a
green body of vessel or tank-like shape (see e.g. EP-A-0 059 002).As an example of manufacture of a ceramic product,
the manufacture of a low tank for supplying water to a
lavatory will be described. Raw materials such as clay and
pottery stone which includes silica and sericite etc.
are pulverized and made into a slip (a water
slurry), and moldings (green bodies) of a predetermined shape
are molded using molds such as gypsum molds and porous resin
molds. After these green bodies have been dried they are
made into products by glazing and firing.Holes are made in the green bodies for mounting a
metal fitting therearround, the dodies are corrected in
shape, and they are then sent to a drying process.In slip casting such as pressurized slip casting, slip
is injected under pressure into a casting cavity surrounded 
with a porous mold, and water channels provided in the
mold are depressurized, so that water in the slip is
absorbed by the mold. The water absorbed into the mold is
discharged to outside the mold. After body material has
adhered to the required thickness to the inner surface of
the mold, the mold is opened. Before taking out the body,
air pressure is applied to the water channels of the mold,
so that water is effused to the inner surface of the mold
to form a thin layer of water at the interface of the
adhered material (the green body) and the mold.After a lower part of the mold is released, and a
pallet is in positioned just below an upper part of the
mold. Then air pressure is applied to the upper mold to
form a water layer on the inner surface thereof, the green
body separates from the upper mold and drops onto the pallet.When a vessel-shaped green body such as a tank drops
in the manner described-above molded by pressure slip
casting, water of a layer produced at the inner surface of
the mold during mold opening drops and collect in the green
body. If this water remains there, crackes from in the
molding during drying of the green body. To deal with
this, conventionally a worker has wiped off the inside of
the green body.In pressurized slip casting, because slip is
pressure-injected into the mold, slip gets between the mating
surfaces of the molds and burrs tend to form. Especially
when a mold is worn, large burrs form easily. 
Conventionally, these burrs

<CLAIMS>
A method of finishing a green ceramic body in which a green
body of vessel-like shape is finished by steps preceding a

drying step, comprising the following steps carried out under
automatic control:


a recognition step wherein the shape of the green
body is recognised by a shape determining device;
a holemaking step wherein a hole is made in the green
body by a holemaking device being applied to a predetermined

location corresponding to the recognised shape;
a water removing step wherein a water-removing suction
device is operated in conformity with a movement pattern

corresponding to the recognised shape and water is removed
from inside the green body;
a correcting step wherein a mold having a shape
conforming to that required of the outer surface of the green

body is selected in correspondence with the recognised
shape and applied to the outer surface of the green body and

a movable pressure plate is inserted into the green body and
presses a side surface of the green body from the inner side

against the mold to correct the shape of the side surface of
the green body;
a suction-holding step wherein with the mold in position
on the outer surface of the green body a suction pad is

pressed against an inner surface of the green body and the 
green body is suction-held; and
an outer surface finishing step wherein the suction-held
green body is lifted and brought into contact with an outer

surface finishing device and finishing of the outer surface
of the green body is carried out.
A method of finishing a green body as set forth in
claim 1, wherein:


the steps from the recognition step to the
suction-holding step are carried out with the green body,

having been molded in a casting step, loaded on a pallet;
a pallet from which the green body has been unloaded in
the suction-holding step is washed, dried and stored; and
a stored washed and dried pallet is supplied to the
casting step.
A method of finishing a green body as set forth in
claim 1, wherein:


an image of the green body is picked up from above by a
CCD camera and whether the green body is rectangular or

triangular is recognised.
A method of finishing a green body as set forth in
claim 1, wherein:


water is removed from the inside of the green body by
the inside of the green body being wiped by a water removing

robot provided with a water absorbent sponge.
A method of finishing a green body as set forth in 
claim 1, wherein:


burrs are removed from the green body by a rotating
cylindrical mesh being brought into contact with the green

body.
A method of finishing a green body as set forth in
claim 1, wherein:


silt and clay residue are removed from the surface of
the green body by a rotating sponge being brought into

contact with the surface of the green body.
