<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic element which is particularly well suited for
use with a near-infrared laser. More specifically, this invention relates to a unique dye which
can be used in the photographic element. Even more specifically this invention relates to the
use of these unique dyes in an antihalation layer of a photographic element.It is well known in the art of photographic science to add dyes to the structure of a
photographic element in such a way as to absorb deleterious light. The dye can be located in
several positions including: between the exposure source and the photosensitive emulsion;
between the photosensitive emulsion and the support; and on the opposite side of the support
to inhibit halation. Specific applications are illustrated, for example, in Research Disclosure,
No. 308, December 1989, Item 308119.Antihalation is particularly important when a film is exposed with a laser such as in the
use of long wavelength laser films for medical imaging. The high intensity of long wavelength
light (i.e. near-infrared) emitted by the laser is difficult to filter completely. If high levels of a
dye are used it is typically difficult to remove the dye during processing and the result is a
coloration, or dye stain, which is undesirable.
Indolenine dyes are known as suitable antihalation dyes. E.g.,
EP-A-0 483 740 discloses dyes of the formula

wherein X is F, Cl, or Br; R is a hydrocarbon moiety containing from two to five
carbon atoms; and Y is a cation; and
EP-A-0 430 244 discloses dyes of the formula
 
where
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are same or different and each represents a substituted or
unsubstituted alkyl group;Z1 and Z2 each represents a non-metallic atomic group necessary for forming a substituted or
unsubstituted benzo-condensed ring or naphtho-condensed ring;Z3 represents a non-metallic atomic group necessary for forming a 5-membered or 6-membered ring;Y represents a hydrogen atom or a monovalent group;X represents an anion; andn represents 1 or 2, and when the dye molecule forms an intramolecular salt, n is 1.Moreover, Anal. Chem. 65, 601-605 (1993) mentions near-infrared dyes of the
formula

wherein X is p-S-C6H4-NCS and Ya and Yb are -(CH2)4SO3- or -C2H5, said dyes being
suitable for labeling proteins.The development of the gallium-arsenic semiconductor laser, or diode laser, is
expected to extend the use of lasers for medical imaging into the wavelength range of 780-830
nm. This application requires a film which is sensitive in this wavelength range and has an
antiha
