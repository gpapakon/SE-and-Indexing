<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing an alkanone and/or an 
alkanol by oxidizing an alkane and/or alkene having from 3 

to 30 C atoms with oxygen to form an alkylhydroperoxide, 

followed by decomposition of the alkylhydroperoxide in the 
presence of a catalyst which contains a metal compound 

immobilized on a carrier material, during the 
decomposition a separate water phase with a pH higher than 

8.5 is present and the metal of the catalyst being chosen 
from the group comprising Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu and the 

carrier material being stable in the presence of the 
separate basic water phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing
a cyclo alkanone and/or a cyclo alkanol by oxidizing a cyclo alkane
and/or cyclo alkene having from 4 to 18 C atoms with oxygen to
form a cyclo alkylhydroperoxide, followed by decomposition of
the cyclo alkylhydroperoxide formed in the presence of a
catalyst which contains a metal compound immobilized on a
carrier material.A similar process is described in EP-A-96798.
This publication describes the preparation of
cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, in which cyclohexane is
first oxidized to a cyclohexylhydroperoxide-containing
oxidation mixture and in which the cyclohexylhydroperoxide
is subsequently decomposed into cyclohexanone and
cyclohexanol. In that process, the decomposition is
effected in the presence of a heterogeneous decomposition
catalyst consisting of cobalt immobilized on a zeolite.
This decomposition catalyst is claimed in EP-A-96798 to
have a longer life and to be more resistant to acids and
water than metal-on-carrier catalysts known in the art,
such as cobalt on carbon as described in US-A-2851496.A disadvantage of the above-mentioned process is
that it employs a zeolite as carrier material, which
zeolite is difficult to get. Another disadvantage is that
with such a cobalt-on-zeolite decomposition catalyst a
small amount of cobalt little by little dissolves in the
reaction mixture, resulting in limited catalyst life. A
further disadvantage is that the presence of a separate
water phase during the decomposition of the
alkylhydroperoxides further diminishes the catalyst
activity by encouraging the cobalt to dissolve in the
reaction mixture. The separate water phase thereby causes 
a significant decrease in the activity of the
decomposition catalyst over a short period of time (e.g. a
few hours). The separate water phase forms as a byproduct
in the oxidation reaction of cyclohexane and in the
decompostion reaction. The negative effect of a separate
water phase on the life of a heterogeneous decomposition
catalyst is also described in, for instance, US-A-4042630.The object of the invention is to provide a
process in which a readily obtainable decomposition
catalyst is employed, which catalyst retains its activity
in spite of the (possible) presence of water in the
oxidation mixture.This object is achieved in that an amount of a
basic, aqueous solution is present in the oxidation
mixture so that a separate water phase with a pH higher
than 8.5 is present during the decomposition and in that
the metal of the catalyst is chosen from the group
compris
