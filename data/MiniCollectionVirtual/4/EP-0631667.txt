<ABSTRACT>
An assay for determining the presence of a threshold concentration of an analyte in a sample comprises first reacting the sample with an amount of anti-analyte selected to reduce the free analyte to a marginally detectable concentration. The sample is then contacted with anti-analyte immobilized on a test region or indicator zone on a solid phase, whereby the residual free analyte may be bound. The binding of free analyte to immobilized anti-analyte is detected by a variety of techniques to indicate the presence of the threshold concentration. By employing limited amounts of anti-analyte on the solid phase, the change between maximum binding of label and no binding of label will be responsive to very small changes in the analyte concentration originally present in the sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ASSAY HAVING IMPROVED DOSE RESPONSE CURVE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to immunoassays for analyte detection and more particularly to immunoassays which rely on a change in a signal to detect analyte concentrations which exceed a preselected threshold value.Immunoassays which produce a visual signal, such as color change, fluorescence, luminescence, or the like, are particularly useful for the detection of threshold concentrations of an analyte. Desirably, such immunoassay systems will provide an extreme signal condition when the concentration of analyte in a sample is below the preselected concentration value and will provide the opposite extreme signal condition when the analyte concentration exceeds the concentration value even by a small amount.Of particular interest to the present invention are membrane assays of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 4,818,677, and lateral flow assays of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 4,943,522, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain membrane assays utilize a reaction cell having a microporous membrane placed over an absorbant capable of drawing a liquid sample perpendiculary through the membrane. A capture reagent, typically an antibody, specific for the analyte is immobilized on the membrane. Sample which is applied to the membrane is drawn therethrough by the absorbant, with any analyte present being captured by the reagent. Signal can be produced by further applying labelled antibodies or other reagents which specifically recognize the analyte and mediate the production of a signal, such as color, fluorescence, or luminescence.Lateral flow assays also utilize a porous membrane for performing a detection reaction. Instead of 

drawing the sample through the membrane perpendicularly, however, the sample is permitted to flow laterally from an application zone to a reaction zone on the membrane surface. The capture reagent is present in the reaction zone, and the captured analyte can be detected by a variety of protocols, including direct visualization of visible moieties associated with the captured analyte (as described in copending application Serial No. 07/639,967, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) .By employing antibodies having a high affinity for the analyte as the capture reagent, a steep or rapid change in the visual signal can be achieved. That is, the signal will change over a very narrow concentration band. While such a rapid or sharp change is
