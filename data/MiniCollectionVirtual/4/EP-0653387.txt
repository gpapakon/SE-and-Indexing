<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a glass composition having a 
bronze color and a luminous (visible) transmittance of 70% or greater. 

The base glass is a soda-lime-silica composition and iron and selenium are 
added as colorants. In one particular embodiment of the invention, a 

bronze colored glass with a luminous transmittance (C.I.E. illuminant A) of 
70% and higher at a thickness of 4.1 millimeters may be attained by 

using as colorants: 0.38 to 0.48 wt. % Fe₂O₃, up to 0.13 wt. % FeO 
and 3 to 15 PPM Se, and preferably 0.395 to 0.465 wt. % Fe₂O₃, 0.075 

to 0.12 wt. % FeO and 6 to 12 PPM Se. In addition, it is preferred that 
the total solar energy transmittance be no greater than 65%.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves a bronze colored glass that has a
luminous transmittance that makes it highly desirable for use in forward
vision areas of a vehicle, such as a windshield and front door windows.
In particular, the glass has a luminous transmittance of 70% or greater.
In addition, the glass of the present invention generally exhibits infrared
and total solar energy transmittance comparable to typical green glasses
used in automotive applications to reduce heat gain in the interior of the
enclosure. The glass is also compatible with flat glass manufacturing
methods.Various heat-absorbing glass substrates are known in the art.
The primary colorant in typical green tinted automotive glasses is iron,
which is usually present in both the Fe2O3 and FeO forms. As is
conventional, the total amount of iron present in a glass is expressed
herein as Fe2O3, regardless of the form actually present. Typical green
tinted automotive glass has about 0.5 percent by weight total iron, with
the ratio of FeO to total iron being about 0.25.Some glasses include nickel oxide as a colorant to provide a
yellow brown to green brown color component to the glass. For example,
U.S. Reissue Patent No. 25,312 to Duncan et al., includes nickel oxide as
a colorant to produce a gray colored glass. However, inclusion of nickel
containing materials must be carefully controlled because the presence of
nickel during the melting process sometimes leads to the formation of
nickel sulfide stones in the glass. Additional potential problems faced
when using nickel include haze formation on the glass surface due to
reduction of the nickel in the tin bath and change in the glass color when
it is heat treated.To avoid this problem, nickel-free bronze and gray glasses
containing iron oxide, cobalt oxide, and selenium were developed as
disclosed in US-A-3,296,004 to Duncan et al., US-A-3,723,142
to Kato et al. and GB-A-1,331,492 to
Bamford. In US-A-4,104,076 to Pons, instead of nickel, Cr2O3
or UO2 are used in combination with iron oxide, cobalt oxide, and 
selenium to produce gray glass. A more recent, nickel-free version of gray
glass is disclosed in US-A-5,023,210 to Krumwiede et al.
which uses iron oxide, cobalt oxide, selenium, and chromic oxide as
colorants.From FR-A-2 690 437 or the corresponding DE-A-43 13 215 colored glass
sheets for cars are known having a base glass portion and a colorant
portion comprising CeO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, CoO, NiO and Se. The bronze colored
glass has a luminous transmittance of at least 70 % at a thickness of 4
mm
