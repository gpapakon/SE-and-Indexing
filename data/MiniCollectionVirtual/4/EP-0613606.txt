<ABSTRACT>
A remote control system including a hand held remote control unit (200) with an alphanumeric information display (209), for controlling and communicating with a first controlled device (100), such as a digital music tuner connected to a community antenna television (CATV) cable, and for controlling a selected one of a plurality of second controlled devices (300), such as CATV set-top-units, VCRs, or televison sets. A first, high speed, error free display information communications protocol is utilized for transmitting program content or other information from the first controlled device (100) to the remote control unit (200) for display. A second or control communications protocol is utilized by the remote control unit (200) for controlling the first controlled device (100) and a selected one of the second controlled devices (300). The first controlled device (100) utilizes a first clock signal embedded in digital music signals provided via the cable to derive clocking signals for implementing the display information communications protocol, resulting in an efficient, low cost electronic design.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to remote control
systems and, more particularly, to a hand held remote control unit for
communicating with a first controlled device by using a first
communications protocol and controlling either a first controlled device
or a second controlled device by using a selected second
communications protocol and, furthermore, that displays program
information associated with a program for the convenience of
listeners/viewers as they are listening/viewing the program.Presently, program content information, for example,
song title, artist, record label, etc., is communicated to the
customer/listener by announcers or disc jockeys (DJs) for audio
programs transmitted by broadcast stations. In the case of video
programs transmitted by broadcast means, video text messages are
presented between programs and during interruptions of programs. In
the case of many premium services, it is undesirable to interrupt
programs for presentation of program content information. It may also 
be undesirable to have any form of announcer or DJ between programs
or selections of music.The cable television (CATV) industry is currently
introducing audio-only services. Program content information is printed
in a separate listing. These cable "radio stations" may play a continuous
succession of musical selections without commercial interruptions.
These services may not use a "disc-jockey" to identify the musical or
other selections.The announcements or interruptions of a program may
be undesirable in some services. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to
communicate program content information. Frustration of customers,
and possible loss of revenue due to subscription cancellation can occur
if a subscriber has no method of knowing the title, composer, or artist
of the particular selection of music. Currently, a subscriber viewing a
premium video program must consult a separate listing, tune to a
different channel, or wait till the end of the program for its
identification. To the music industry, identification of the recording
label and the musical selection is critical to the sale of recordings. To
lovers of music, having such information as music tide, composer, artist
and record label is vital. Without this information, the service will be
reduced to the level of generic background music.The prior art has recognized the requirement to
communicate program content information associated with a broadcast
performance. It is known to use a display to communicate program
information associated with a
