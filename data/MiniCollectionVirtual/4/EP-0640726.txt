<ABSTRACT>
A loader (18) includes a pair of rear supports (20) projecting 
transversely outwardly from a longitudinally extending vehicle 

frame (12). The loader (18) further includes a pair of posts (22) 
having receptacles (98) at the bottoms thereof which are received 

about the rear supports (20) when the posts (22) are in upright 
dispositions, the receptacles (98) being shaped for then retaining 

the posts (22) on the supports (20). A front end structure 
like a weight bracket forms a bumper at the forward end of the 

vehicle (10) and a yoke extends forwardly from the posts (22) and 
has a bight portion including a remotely operable releasable 

latch mechanism which releasably latches the bight portion to the 
front end structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a loader including a pair of
transversely spaced upright posts respectively releasably secured
to a pair of rear supports carried by a vehicle frame, a yoke
coupled to the upright posts including a pair of legs extending
forwardly from the post along opposite sides of the vehicle and
having forward ends joined together by a bight portion releasably
secured to a transverse front end structure fixed to the forward
end of the vehicle frame.Designers have spent a lot of effort trying to come up with designs
which permit a loader to be easily attached to, or detached
from, a tractor. As considered when mounted on a tractor, these
loaders typically include a pair of spaced apart, upright masts
or standards respectively having lower ends coupled to frame
members extending outwardly from the tractor frame. The rear ends
of a pair of loader arms are pivotally attached to upper ends of
the masts and a pair of boom cylinders are coupled between the
masts and the arms for raising and lowering the arms relative to
the tractor. A yoke or U-shaped brace structure has a pair of
legs respectively rigidly attached to the masts at locations
below the upper ends thereof and joined together by a transverse
bight portion extending ahead of and releasably coupled to a
forward end of the tractor. It is the connections between the
bottom ends of the masts and the tractor-mounted frame members
and between the bight portion of the yoke or brace and the front
end of the tractor that designers have been trying to simplify.
The present invention relates to the connection of the yoke bight
portion to the forward end of the tractor.Typically, a tractor is provided with brackets or hangers adapted
for having the yoke releasably attached thereto. These brackets
or hangers are usually intended to stay with the tractor even
when the loader is detached and, in the case of relatively small
tractors, such as those used for lawn and garden work, sometimes
present a hinderance to the attachment of other front accessories
such as blades, snowblowers, brooms and front mowers. In any
event, these mounting brackets or hangers are an additional component 
required for the complete loader package and thus add to
the cost of such a package. Furthermore, attaching hardware is
often required for securing the yoke to the mounting brackets or
hangers and makes it necessary for an operator to take care not
to lose or misplace the hardware. U.S. Patent No. 4,470,751 granted
to Masuzawa et al on 11 Sept. 1984 and U.S. Patent

latch (66) extending between and being pivotally mounted to
said bight portion (27) for rotation about a substantially

horizontal axis, between a rearward closed position wherein
it is in engagement with said horizontal surface and a

forward open position wherein it is spaced away from said
top surface and control means (82) for remotely moving said

latch (66) between said open and closed positions.
Loader defined in claim 1, characterized in that said front
end structure (21) includes a forward and the horizontal

surface, which is a top surface, whereas both surfaces are
joined at substantially at right angle and in that said

latch (66) is formed as a plate having an inverted L-shaped
cross section and including a first leg (68) extending upwardly

from said axis and a second end (70) joined to and
extending rearwardly from a top end of said first leg (68). 
Loader defined in claim 2, characterized in that said front
end structure (21) is a weight bracket having a front, upright

wall (40) in the form of a rectangular plate, as viewed
from the front, and in that at least one locating tab

(74) formed from a strap having a lower end fixed to a forward
surface of said cross member (58), whereas said locating

tab (74) has an upper rearwardly inclined portion (76)
for guiding the front upright wall (40) of the front end

structure (21) into a space between the cross member (58)
and the latch (66) during mounting of the loader (18) to

the vehicle (10).
Loader defined in claim 3, characterized in that said front
end structure (21) includes a rear upright wall (42) disposed

in parallel relationship to said front wall (40),

located between the two stiffener ribs of each

pair of ribs (48, 50) whereby during mounting of the loader
