<ABSTRACT>
The process for coating metal substrates, in particular steel sheet or aluminium sheet in strip form, with a covering layer of metal or metal alloy comprises cleaning, degreasing and activating of the substrate, it being intended that firmly adhering covering layers can be applied to metal substrates without major pollution of the environment. For this purpose, the application of an adhesion promoter layer after the activation is envisaged, and the device for carrying out the process is equipped in such a way that an additional coating section 4 for applying the adhesion promoter layer is provided in the vacuum section between the activation section 3 and the coating section 7 for applying the covering layer.
