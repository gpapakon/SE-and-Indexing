<ABSTRACT>
A stapler is provided which allows confirmation of the remaining number or leg
length of staples stored in a case from the outside. A plurality of through holes 15

is opened along a guide rail 20 in the case 10 in the walls 10B, 10C of the case 10
of the stapler. In this case, confirmation of the position of the staple pushing part

43 is facilitated by the provision of a mark 47 on the staple pushing part 43. The
remaining number of staples 30 is determined based on the position of the staple

pushing part 43. It is possible to confirm the leg length of the staples 30 from the
longitudinal through hole 15 above the staple ejecting mouth 10D.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stapler used when stapling documents for
example, and in particular relates to improvements in confirming the remaining
number or leg length of staples which are stored in the case of the stapler.A stapler (paper fastener) functions by pressing out gate shaped staples one
by one from a staple ejecting part in order to fasten an object such as documents.
Staples are disposed on a guide rail provided in the case of the stapler. The
staples are adapted to reach a staple ejecting mouth on the lower tip of the guide
rail by being pushed by a staple pushing member. The staples are ejected one by
one from the staple at the head of the staples. When staples are used up, new
staples are supplied on the guide rail by a manual operation. Staples used in the
stapler have a plurality of types differing with respect to leg length. Fastening
operations are adapted by changing the staple leg length in response to the
thickness of the object to be fastened.Thus when a stapler is in use, it is convenient to know the leg length or the
remaining number of staples which are stored in the case. However the case of a
conventional stapler is formed from non-transparent metal and thus the staples in
the case can only be seen to a limited extent from an aperture provided in proximity
to the staple ejecting part. As a result, a user of a stapler has not been able to 
confirm a remaining number of staples until the number of staples has reduced to
such an extent as to be visible from the aperture provided near the staple ejecting
part. Furthermore when it is desired to confirm the leg length of the staples in the
case, it has been necessary to eject a staple for example in an empty operation.In order to solve the above problem, small staplers in the prior art (staples
operated with one hand) are provided with a case formed from a transparent
member, comprised of resin for example, in order to render the interior of the case
visible. However such a resin case does not have sufficient strength and can not
be used to form the case of large staplers (desktop type staplers) which withstand
relatively large loads. That is to say, large staplers require the use of metals of a
certain strength as materials to form the case and thus it has not been possible to
provide transparency allowing visual confirmation of the state of staples in the case.The present invention is proposed to solve the above problem and has the
object of providing a stapler which allows confirmation from the outside of the leg
length
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stapler comprising:

a guide rail on which staples are disposed slidably;
a staple pushing member which pushes the staples from behind toward a
staple ejecting part, the staple pushing member disposed to slide on the guide rail,

and
a case storing the guide rail and the staple pushing member characterized in
that an observation port allowing viewing of the staples is formed in the case along

the guide rail.
A stapler as defined in Claim 1 characterized in that at least a part of the
observation port has a predetermined length in a vertical direction which allows

viewing of a lower end of staples disposed on the guide rail irrespective of a leg
length of staple used in the stapler.
A stapler as defined in Claim 1 characterized in that the observation port
comprises a plurality of through holes aligned in a lateral direction of the guide rail.
A stapler as defined in Claim 3 characterized in that at least one of the through
holes has a predetermined length in a vertical direction which allows viewing of a

lower end of staples disposed on the rail irrespective of a leg length of staple used in
the stapler.
A stapler as defined in any one of Claim 1 to Claim 4 characterized in that a
mark is provided on the staple pushing member which is visible from the

observation port.
A stapler as defined in Claim 5 characterized in that the mark is colored in a
color which is different from the color of the staples or the staple pushing member.
A stapler as defined in any one of Claim 1 to Claim 6 characterized in that the
guide rail is colored in a color which is different from the color of the staple pushing

member.
A stapler as defined in any one of Claim 1 to Claim 7 characterized in that the
staples are colored in a color which is different from the color of the staple pushing

member.
