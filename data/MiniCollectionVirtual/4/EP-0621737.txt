<ABSTRACT>
A stereo ultradirectional microphone apparatus for 
detecting a sound to produce stereo sound signals, 

comprises: first and second ultradirectional microphones 
arranged side by side with a given distance in parallel for 

converting a sound into first and second sound signals 
respectively, first and second delays for delaying an 

output of the first and second microphones by a delay time τ 
respectively, and first and second subtractors for 

subtracting for subtraction between the first sound signal 
and an output of the second delay and subtracting for 

subtraction between the second sound signal and an output 
of the first delay. The delay time τ corresponds to a 

difference between the timings of a sound from a sound 
source in a direction making a clockwise angel ϑ from the 

front where a dead angel should be made. The subtraction 
provides the dead angle. Similarly, a dead angle on the 

side is also made to obtain a stereo characteristic. The 
directivity in the frequency characteristic of microphone 

is equalized to cancel the sensitivity in the dead angle. 
A stereo apparatus for forming the dead angles with two set 

of two filters having respective transfer characteristics 
determined
 by measurement and an adder is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stereo ultradirectional 
microphone apparatus for receiving and converting a sound 
into a set of stereo sound signals. Sets of stereo microphones are known. As a simple, 
a set of stereo microphones comprising two directional 
microphones are used. Each of these directional 
microphones has a unidirectional characteristic showing a 
high sensitivity in a direction (hereinafter this direction 
in which the microphone shows a high sensitivity is 
referred to as a main lobe). Two directional microphones 
are arranged to obtain a stereo effect such that a lobe of 
one directional microphone is directed to +  direction and 
a lobe of the other directional microphone is directed to - 
 direction with respect to the front thereof wherein  is 
selected from the range 45° ≦ |  | ≦ 90°. Such general 
type stereo microphones aim to record sounds from sources 
existing in a wide angle range viewed from the recording 
point, i.e., a location of the stereo microphones. However, 
if a sound from a source existing a predetermined narrow 
angle range is recorded using general type of stereo  
 
microphones, it is impossible to record the sound with a 
sufficient SN ratio because such stereo microphones have 
too large width of the main lobe, so that sounds coming 
from directions other than the predetermined narrow angle 
rage are recorded as noises. In the actual recording scene, 
such situations may occur frequently. As a solution to 
this problem, in place of the unidirectional microphone, an 
ultradirectional microphone having a more sharp directional 
characteristics is studied to be applied to the directional 
microphone apparatus (GERLACH H, "Stereo sound recording 
with shotgun microphones", J Audio Eng Soc, Vol. 37 No. 10 
Page 832-838 '89). This document discloses examples of a 
stereo recording apparatus to which the ultradirectional 
microphones is applied, namely, XY and MS structures. The 
XY structure has two ultradirectional microphones are used 
where one is directed in +  direction and the other is 
directed in -  direction with respect to the front thereof 
on recording. The MS structure has one ultradirectional microphone 
and a bi-directional microphone wherein a main lobe of the 
ultradirectional microphone is directed to the front and 
the lobe of the bi-directional microphone is directed to 
have an angle of 90° from the front. Left side and right 
side outputs are obtained by adding or subtracting between 
the outputs of these two microphones. Both XY and MS
