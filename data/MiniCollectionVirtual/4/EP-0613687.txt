<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a use of pregnane 
derivatives of the following general formula: 


in which R = H₂, (H,OH), (H,OAcyl), or O, and especially 
the pregnane derivative(7α,17α)-17-hydroxy-7-methyl-19-nor-17-pregn-5(10)-en-20-yn-3-one 

(compound I), for the 
manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or 

treatment of tumors.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the endocrine therapy of breast cancer, patients
may be treated with hormones, like progestogens (G.H.
Bakker et al. in Hormonal Manipulation of Cancer:
Peptides, Growth Factors, and New (Anti) Steroidal
Agents, edited by Jan G.M. Klijn et al., Raven Press,
New York, 1987, p. 39) and androgens (M.N. Teller et
al., Cancer Res. 26, No.2, Pt.1, 245, 1966; S. Dauvois
et al., Ann.N.Y.Acad.Sc. 595, 413, 1990). Cancer
treatment with progestogens gives, however, undesirable
side-effects, especially when applied in high dosages,
such as abdominal distension and pain, nausea, headache,
depression, and the like. When androgens are applied,
also a number of unfavourable side-effects occurs, of
which virilizing phenomena like hoarseness, hirsutism
and alopecia are most frequently observed.The use of other drugs not having the above-mentioned
undesired side-effects would be highly
favourable. However, it is known that such drugs are not
permitted to have estrogen activity: drugs with estrogen
activity cannot be used in patients having breast cancer
due to the apparent estrogen sensitivity of mammary
tumors (R.W. Brueggemeier et al., Cancer Research 48,
6808, 1988; Y.J. Abul-Hajj, J. Steroid Biochem., 34,
439, 1989).We now have found compounds which are suitable for
preventing or treating cancer, in particular mammary
tumors, with improved properties with respect to side-effects. The invention relates to the use of pregnane derivatives
of the following general formula:

in which R = H2, (H,OH), (H,OAcyl), or O, for the
preparation of a medicament for the prevention or
treatment of tumors. These compounds, in particular the
derivatives in which R = (H,OH) or O, and especially the
pregnane derivative in which R = O, (7α,17α)-17-hydroxy-7-methyl-19-nor-17-pregn-5(10)-en-20-yn-3-one
(compound
I), have in rats a clearly established estrogen activity,
apart from a very weak androgen activity; progestogenic
activity could not be demonstrated in this species
(J. de Visser et al., Arzneim. Forsch. 34, 1010, 1984).
Although it can be anticipated that the estrogen
activity of this compound would prevent its application
in breast tumor therapy, it is surprisingly found that
this compound has no negative estrogen-like, tumor-increasing
effects on DMBA-induced mammary tumors in rats.
Contrary to expectation, tumor growth was significantly
decreased on treatment with the compound of the invention.
This compound can, therefore, be used as a
medicament in anti-tumor therapy without having
unfavourable side-effects.The term acyl
