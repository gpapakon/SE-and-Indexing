<ABSTRACT>
A low depth nestable tray (20) for holding cans of similar capacities and body diameters but with varying top and bottom rim diameters. The tray comprises floor (50), a band (30) around the periphery of the tray and columns (70) interconnecting the band (30) to the floor (50). Nesting ledges are disposed on columns (70) and on corner posts (100) of the wall structure. The ledges are equal in height and act as supports for the weight of a stack of nested empty trays (20) which prevents the walls from having to support the weight and results in the walls maintaining their shape and structural integrity. The floor (50) is configured with support areas (53) for the containers and has features for accommodating bottom rims of varying diameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low depth, nestable tray for transporting
and storing beverage containers having substantially equal diameters and differently
sized top and bottom rims. Examples of such containers are twelve-ounce
aluminum cans (ca. 0,34 kg) which are made with similar body diameters and different top and
bottom rim diameters.Cans for soft drinks, beer and other beverages are often stored and
transported during the distribution stages thereof in trays or boxes. Previously,
single serving sized cans such as those which hold twelve fluid ounces were made
in generally uniform sizes. The body diameters and the bottom and top rim
diameters were generally consistent so that a tray could accommodate any can in
stacked and cross-stacked configurations. However, currently the beverage
industries are manufacturing cans having substantially equal body diameters and
smaller top and bottom rim diameters.An explanation for the varying diameters of the top and bottom rims on
aluminum cans is economics. The cost of manufacturing is decreased by making
cans with smaller top and bottom rims. Therefore, as the beverage industries
switch to cans having smaller top and bottom rims, there has been a need for a
returnable and reusable tray for storing, displaying and transporting cans which is
light weight, easy to handle and economical. The prior art does not provide a tray 
which can accommodate cans with varying top and bottom rim diameters in both
stacked and cross-stacked configurations.Examples of returnable and reusable single purpose trays are disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,932,532; U.S. Patent 4,823,955 and U.S. Patent No.
5,031,774. The previous trays are configured for use with cans of substantially
the same top and bottom rim diameters. A bottler or distributor which uses the
newly introduced cans with smaller top and bottom rims cannot effectively use the
prior trays since any interlocking features for stacking or cross-stacking loaded
trays would not fit correctly. The result may be unstable loads of stacked and
cross-stacked trays, and inefficiency.Plastic low depth cases have been developed wherein the side walls are
lower than the height of the stored containers. Since containers placed in the cases
would extend above the side walls, the containers in a lower case support the
weight of the other cases stacked on top of them. Metal cans generally have the
structural integrity to bear the compressive loads of loaded and stacked trays.Some major problems experienced with previous nestable
