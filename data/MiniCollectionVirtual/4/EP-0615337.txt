<ABSTRACT>
In a method for setting the volume in an audio device of motor vehicles, in which a nominal volume level is predetermined by a volume control, the nominal level is compared with a frequency-dependent reference curve of the noise in the interior of the vehicle for a noise reference level. The frequencies, the nominal levels of which are above the reference level, remain unchanged and the frequencies, the nominal levels of which are below the reference level, are raised to an actual level which is on or above the reference level.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the setting of volume levels for an audio unit of motor 
vehicles, wherein a volume target level (2, 3) is specified by a volume 

setting device, the target level is compared with a pre-established 
frequency-dependentvehicle interior noise reference curve for a noise 

reference level (1, 1', 1"), the frequencies, which have a target level 
above the reference level, remain unchanged and those frequencies 

which have a target level below the reference level are elevated to an 
actual level (4, 5) which lies at or above the reference level, wherein 

the reference curve is established and set before installation. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the reference 
curve can be changed in a manner which is vehicle-speed dependent.
