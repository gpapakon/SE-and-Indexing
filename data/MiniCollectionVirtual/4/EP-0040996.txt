<ABSTRACT>
Digital pressure measuring system including a pri­
mary pressure transducer [24]
 with a pressure sensitive 
capacitor [C
s
] and a pressure insensitive reference ca­

pacitor [C
r
]; these capacitors [C
s
, C
r
] are excited by 

out-of-phase signals and their outputs combined at a 
summing junction [12]
; the output of the summing junc­
tion [12]
 controls the incrementation of a counter [16] 

whose output is converted to a nonlinear negative feed­
back signal by means of a digital-to-analog converter 

[26] and a feedback pressure transducer [105]
 including 
a pressure sensitive capacitor [C
fs
] and a pressure in­

sensitive reference capacitor [C
fr
] which are excited by 

out-of-phase signals from said converter [26]; a closed 

loop is formed by applying the nonlinear negative feed­
back signal appearing at the output of feedback pressure 

transducer [105] to the summing junction [12]
; the 
counter [16]
 is incremented in a direction to null the 
loop such that its output is representative of the meas­

ured pressure.
