<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for the demodulation of coded pulse trains which have been transposed into modulated signals, in particular pulse trains for digitized radio speech transmission. The method requires the minimum of technical resources and can be carried out with circuits designed using integrated-circuit technology. The signal to be demodulated is subjected to quadrature modulation. One of the two quadrature components thus obtained is subjected to differentiation or integration and the signal thus obtained is fed, after analogue/digital conversion, to a comparator (9, 10), as is the other quadrature-component signal. The digital output signals from the two comparators (9, 10) are combined using a coincidence gate (11) to form the coded pulse train.

Method for demodulating pulse messages, which
have been converted into modulated signals, by using

quadrature modulation (2...7), the quadrature components
which have been obtained in the form of analog signals

being converted from analog to digital with reference to
a threshold value and subsequently assembled digitally by

means of coincidence gate logic, characterized in that,
of the two quadrature components which have been obtained

from the quadrature modulation (2...7) in the form of
analog signals, one quadrature component is differentiated

or integrated prior to the analog-to-digital
conversion, and in that the quadrature components converted

from analog to digital are assembled digitally by
means of coincidence gate logic to form the pulse message.
