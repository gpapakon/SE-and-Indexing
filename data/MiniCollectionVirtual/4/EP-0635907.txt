(12) having a plurality of electrical terminal members 

(70) disposed in respective terminal receiving 
passageways (18), a like plurality of electrical 

components (80) disposed in component receiving 
passageways (22), a ground means including a plate-like 

portion (40) disposed adjacent a forward face (14) of 
the housing member (12), a rear plate (56) disposed 

adjacent the rearward face (16) of the housing member 
(12), and resilient conductive means (90) to bias the 

electrical components (80) and complete an electrical 
path from the terminal members (70) to a respective 

component to ground. The components (80) are of the 
type having a pair of spaced external electrodes 

(82,84). The component receiving passageways (22) are 
essentially parallel to and spaced from respective 

associated terminal receiving passageways (18). The 
ground (40) and rear plates (56) define forward and 

rearward stop surfaces respectively for the component 
receiving passageways (22). The rear plate (56) further 

includes conductive paths (64) that extend between 
respective component receiving passageways (22) to 

respective terminal receiving bores (62) and into 
electrical engagement with the terminals disposed 

therein. The resilient conductive means (90) is under 
compression in each component receiving passageway 

adjacent one of the plates, electrically connecting one 
of the component electrodes (82,84) to the one plate and 

biasing the component against the other plate and the 
other electrode into electrical engagement therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors,
and more particularly to filtered electrical connectors
for providing protection against electromagnetic
interference.Electrical circuitry often must be protected from
disruptions caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI)
entering the system.Frequently today's electronic circuitry requires
the use of high density, multiple contact electrical
connectors. There are many applications in which it is
desirable to provide a connector with a filtering
capability, for example, to suppress EMI. One method of
achieving filtering capability is to incorporate a
circuit board having a plurality of electrical
components mounted thereto. The components include
multilayer ceramic capacitors or transient suppression
diodes or the like, typically of the type having a pair
of spaced external electrodes, which are soldered or
adhered with conductive adhesives to circuit paths on
the board. Accordingly, the solder or otherwise adhered
interconnections are subject to stresses caused by
movement of the board whether from thermal expansion or
contraction or when used in an environment subject to
constant vibration. Document US-A-4,729,752 discloses
a board having transient suppression diodes thereon.To retain the convenience and flexibility of the
connector, however, it is desirable that the filtering
capability be incorporated into connectors in a manner
that will permit full interchangability between the
filtered connectors and their unfiltered counterparts.
In particular, any filtered connector should also in
many instances retain substantially the same dimensions
as the unfiltered version and should have the same
contact arrangement so that either can be connected to
an appropriate mating connector. A filtered connector is disclosed including a
dielectric housing member having a plurality of terminal
receiving passageways extending between a forward face
and a rearward face thereof. The housing member further
includs a like plurality of component receiving
passageways extending between the forward and rearward
faces, each of the component receiving passageways being
associated with a respective one of the terminal
receiving passageways and being spaced therefrom. A
plurality of terminal members are provided, each being
disposed in a respective terminal receiving passageway
of the housing, the terminal members having a forward
contact section and a rearward contact sections. A
ground means is provided and includes a plate-like
portion disposed adjacent the forward face of
