<ABSTRACT>
A slot antenna (18) has a substantially reduced 
ground plane by defining the slot within a loop of a narrow 

conductive strip (23), for example a deposited metal, around 
a slot opening less than one half the wavelength of the 

intended signal frequency to be received by the antenna. A 
conductor such as a central conductor (26) of a coaxial 

cable (32) coupled to the conductive strip (23) on one side 
of the slot, while another conductor (28) such as the ground 

shield of the coaxial cable (32) is terminaled at a position 
across the slot from the central conductor terminal. In 

addition, the gain and bandwidth of the antenna may be 
improved by adding a similarly constructed loop or loops of 

slot antenna in parallel to the first slot to form an 
overlapping series of loops. Such a modification forms a 

ground plane with an overlapping series of loop conductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to antennas
and, more particularly, to motor vehicle antenna
constructions in the form of slot antennas.A number of antennas has been developed to replace
typical monopole antennas which are still widely used in
motor vehicles because of their simple structure and
effectiveness. However, because such antennas protrude from
exterior surfaces of the vehicle, they are exposed to
destructive impacts and create aerodynamic disturbances that
affect performance or create noise as the vehicle travels.
Moreover, retractor mechanisms for such antennas
substantially increase the cost of supplying the component,
and they displace the monopole from an operable, exposed
position to an inoperative, retracted position where
reception is obstructed by adjacent conductive parts such as
engine parts, chassis parts or body panels.One previous way to overcome such problems has been
to incorporate the antenna in other body panels. For
example, conductive body panels such as expanded areas of
sheet metal may be employed to form slot antennas by cutting
a slot into an expanded ground plane made of conductive
material. Sheet metal panels of the vehicle have previously
been employed to form the slot antenna. Conductor terminals
are secured at locations on opposite sides of the slot to
transfer the voltage signal received by the antenna.
Adjusting the relative positions of the terminals on the
ground plane affects the impedance of the antenna, but the
ground plane is generally very large in relation to the size
of the slots. Moreover, the surface area of ground plane
would typically be enlarged in order to enhance the
performance of the antenna. A shield of a coaxial cable may
be attached to one side of the slot and the centre conductor
of the coaxial cable secured to the opposite side of the
slot, the impedance being adjusted by moving the feed point 
along the length of the slot and adjusting the dimensions of
the slot itself. Typically, a slot would be a half
wavelength long. For example, a slot in the ground plane
would be 18.75 inches long for reception of a signal at 315
megahertz.Moreover, the directional sensitivity of the antenna
is affected by the alignment of the antenna, and horizontal
panels of the motor vehicles are not most advantageous for
reception of higher frequency signals, for example on the
order of a 315 megahertz signal used for remote keyless
entry systems, or a 820-895 megahertz signal used for
cellular phone systems. For example, U.S. Patent No.
