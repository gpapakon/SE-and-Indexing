<ABSTRACT>
An optical waveguide is described which has an essential planar substrate and a waveguiding layer applied to the substrate. The invention consists in that the substrate is made from plastic or from a material which has a large organic component. This has the advantage that the high refractive index of the inorganic waveguiding layer is combined with the material properties of the plastic substrate, such as for example fracture resistance, plastic and thermoplastic deformability, photochemical structurability and others.
