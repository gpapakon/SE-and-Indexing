<ABSTRACT>
A helical scan magnetic tape recorder 
includes a rotary head scanner (50) and an air 

lubricated bearing magnetic tape guidance system 
(42),(44),(46),(48) for correcting magnetic tape 

position errors in a gentle and precise manner without 
damage to the tape. The magnetic tape guidance system 

includes several magnetic tape guiding elements 
(42),(44),(46),(48) including a nonrotatable air 

lubricated bearing (62), and spaced magnetic tape edge 
guides (64),(68) for contacting the edges of guided 

magnetic tape. One of the edge guides (64) is rigidly 
mounted (66) and the other edge guide (68) is 

compliantly mounted (70). The rigidly mounted edge 
guide (64),(66) is adjustable. Any adjustment of the 

rigid edge guide (64),(66) to change the lateral 
position of guided magnetic tape is absorbed by the 

compliantly mounted edge guide (68),(70) without 
adjustment thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to helical 
scan magnetic tape recorders and relates, more 
particularly, to an all air support tape guidance 
apparatus in helical scan magnetic tape recorders. Helical scan magnetic tape recorders are 
widely used to record and reproduce analog and digital 
video and data information. In a helical scan magnetic 
tape recorder, magnetic tape is transported around a 
magnetic tape path from a supply reel to a takeup reel 
past a rotary head scanner. The rotary head scanner 
includes one or more rotating magnetic heads. The 
magnetic tape is transported around the rotary head 
scanner in a helical path so that the rotating magnetic 
head(S) records on (or reproduces from) slant tracks 
across the width of the tape. In transporting the magnetic tape around the 
tape path it is desirable to transport the tape in a 
manner which avoids physical damage to the tape and 
consequent loss of recorded information. At the same 
time, the tape must be guided at a precise angle 
relative to the rotary head scanner so that the 
rotating magnetic heads record parallel tracks on the 
tape and accurately reproduce information from the 
recorded tracks. US-A-3,912,144 and US-A-3,227,343, 
disclose air bearing guides for guiding magnetic tape 
relative to magnetic heads. The air bearing guides 
have both rigid and compliant edge guides. However, 
there is no disclosure in either of these patents of 
easily guiding and controlling the tape in the vicinity 
of the magnetic heads to correct for errors in tape 
angle and in tape bending moment. There is thus a problem in the field of 
magnetic tape recording and reproducing apparatus in 
providing for correction of tape position errors (such  
 
as tape angle and tape bending moment) in a gentle and 
precise manner without damage to the magnetic tape. According to the present invention there is 
provided a solution to the problems of the prior art of 
magnetic tape recording and reproducing apparatus in 
the correction of magnetic tape position errors in a 
gentle and precise manner without damage to the tape. 
In general, according to the present invention, there 
is provided in a helical scan magnetic tape recorder an 
air support magnetic tape guidance system including a 
plurality of air lubricated tape guiding elements on 
either side of a stationary magnetic head(s) or a 
rotary head scanner. Each of the tape guiding elements 
has an adjustable, rigidly mounted, tape edge guide and 
a compliant tape edge guide. The rigid tape edge 
guide
