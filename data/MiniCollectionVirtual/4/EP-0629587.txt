<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing fluoride glass, including 
the steps of: introducing a raw material for fluoride 

glass into a heating vessel; and heating the raw material 
in the heating vessel, while causing the heating vessel 

to have a negative internal pressure and introducing an 
inert gas into the heating vessel, thereby to melt the raw 

material under heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and an
apparatus for producing fluoride glass containing less
impurity to be mixed therein, which may suitably be used
for an optical fiber. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a process and an apparatus for
producing fluoride glass which is capable of reducing
transmission loss and may suitably be used for an optical
fiber.Heretofore, as an apparatus for producing fluoride
glass in an atmosphere of inert gas, there has been known
an apparatus disclosed in a reference "Fluoride Glass
Optical Fibers", by P. W. FRANCE et al., published by
Blackie, 1990, pp 110 - 112. This apparatus comprises a
glove box wherein work or treatment is to be conducted in
an atmosphere of inert gas, and a furnace for melting or
fusion connected to an upper part of the glove box. This
furnace comprises a core tube made of quartz glass (or
silica glass). In such an apparatus, a crucible
containing therein a raw material for glass can be moved
from the melting furnace into the glove box and can be
moved from the glove box into the melting furnace, as 
desired.A process for producing fluoride glass by using the
above-mentioned apparatus is briefly described below.Thus, there is provided a raw material comprising a
component such as ZrF4, BaF2, LaF3, AlF3, NaF and PbF2, to
which a fluorinating agent of NH4HF2 has been added in an
amount of 5 to 30 weight % based on the total weight of
the raw material. The raw material is placed in a
platinum (Pt) crucible and is fluorinated under heating
at 400 °C.
A reaction formula for this fluorination is as follows:
ZrO2 + NH4 HF2 → ZrF4 + H2O + NH3Subsequently, the raw material is melted under
heating at 850 °C - 950 °C to provide a molten mixture.
Thereafter, the resultant molten mixture is vitrified by
casting.However, when the above-mentioned apparatus and
process are used, there is posed a problem such that fine
crystals are formed in the resultant glass after
quenching or rapid cooling.An optical fiber comprising fluoride glass is
excellent in transmission characteristic in a long
wavelength range, as compared with that of an optical
fiber comprising quartz glass. In addition, it is
theoretically predicted that an optical fiber comprising
fluoride glass can provide a transmission loss of 10-2dB/km or less. Accordingly, it is expected that such an
optical fiber comprising fluoride glass is useful as an
optical fiber for long-distance communication and a host
fiber for optical amplification. However, at present,
fluoride glass
