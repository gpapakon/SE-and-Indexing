comprising a hollow mandrel (18), the hollow mandrel (18) having an 

outer surface with the groove (17) shaped to the form of the reinforcing 
member, means (19) for applying a closed end of the bag like member into 

the hollow mandrel (18) and an open end of the bag like member over the 
hollow mandrel (18) at the outer surface with the groove (17), the 

reinforcing member being located with respect to the bag like member at

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for and a method of
welding a reinforcing member to a bag like member.It is known from FR-A-1136378 to provide an apparatus for
welding a reinforcing member 78 to a bag like member 74
comprising a hollow mandrel 71 having an outer surface and
means for welding the reinforcing member to the bag like
member.The present invention is characterised in that the outer
surface of the mandrel has a groove shaped to the form of the
reinforcing member; means are provided for applying the
closed end of the bag like member into the hollow mandrel
and an open end of the bag like member over the hollow
member at the outer surface of the groove, the reinforcing
member being located with respect to the bag like member at
the position of the groove.Preferably the means for applying the bag like member
include means for gripping the bag like member at a
plurality of sites on a circumference of the open end of
the bag like member. The means for applying the bag like
member may include means for expanding the open end of the
bag like member, and also the means for welding the
reinforcing member may include means for applying heat
and/or pressure.The reinforcing member may be located in the groove prior
to the application of the bag like member.The means for gripping the bag like member may include a
plurality of prongs positionable within the open end of the
bag like member and cam means for moving the prongs from a
position in which they are separated from one another to
expand the open end of the bag like member. The gripper prongs may be in the form of captively held
rollers rotatable on axes parallel to one another and to
the bag like member. The prongs in the expanded condition
preferably provide an opening therein, and the welding
means is in the form of a head which can pass through the
said opening.Means may also be provided for removing surplus material at
the open end of the bag like means extending beyond the
reinforcing member. The means for removing the surplus
material may be provided by movement of the prongs after
welding has taken place.One or more gas injectors may be provided to open and/or
maintain open the open end of the bag like member.The mandrel may be mounted on a turntable which rotates the
mandrel to operational positions, in which the bag like
material is applied thereto, welded thereto and removed
therefrom.In one convenient arrangement the bag like member and the
reinforcing members are annular.According to another aspect of the present invention is a
reinfor

Apparatus for welding a reinforcing member to a bag
like member (10) comprising welding means and a

hollow mandrel (18) adapted
to receive in its interior a closed end of the bag like

member (10) with the reinforcing member to be welded to the
bag like member over the outer surface of the mandrel

by said welding means

characterised in that
 the outer surface of the mandrel
has a groove (17) shaped to the form of the reinforcing

member; means are provided for applying the closed end of
the bag like member into the hollow mandrel and an open end

of the bag like member over the hollow mandrel at the outer
surface of the groove (17), the reinforcing member being

located with respect to the bag like member at the position
of the groove.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the means
for applying the bag like member includes means (19) for

gripping the bag like member at a plurality of sites on a
circumference of the open end of the bag like member.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which
the means for applying the bag like member includes means

(20, 21, 22, 23, 24) for expanding the open end of the bag
like member.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims in which the means for welding the reinforcing

member includes means (51) for applying heat and/or
pressure.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims in which the reinforcing member is located in the

groove (17) prior to the application of the bag like
member. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 3, 4 or 5 in which
the means for gripping the bag like member includes a

plurality of prongs (20, 21, 22, 23, 24) positionable
within the open end of the bag like member and cam means

(30, 31 and 32) for moving the prongs from a closed
position in which they enter the bag like means and a

position in which they are separated from one another to
expand the open end of the bag like member.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, in which the
gripper prongs are in the form of captively held rollers

(44) rotatable on axes parallel to one another and to the
bag like member.
