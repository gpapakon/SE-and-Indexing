<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stable liquid preparation
of complex vitamin for internal use, and more
specifically to a liquid preparation of complex vitamin
for internal use, which remains stable even when stored
for a long period at room temperature.Like vitamin B6, vitamin B1 and vitamin B12 are
closely associated with nervous functions and are effective
for the improvement of neuroses such as neuralgia,
arthralgia, peripheral neuritis and peripheral
paralysis. A variety of tablets and capsules added
with these vitamins are therefore available on the
market.As a dosage form, a liquid preparation generally
features that compared with such tablets and capsules,
the liquid preparation is more readily absorbed in the
body and is easier to take. Nonetheless, no stable
liquid preparation added with both vitamin B1 and
vitamin B12 has been available on the market. This is
attributed to the poor storage stability of a liquid 
preparation containing both of them.As causes for the poor storage stability of the
liquid preparation added with both vitamin B1 and
vitamin B12, it is known that the stable pH ranges of
these vitamins in an aqueous solution are different,
i.e., pH 2-4 for vitamin B1 and pH 4.5-5 for vitamin
B12 and also that SH-containing decomposition products
of vitamin B1 extremely lower the stability of vitamin
B12.Further, sucrose is generally used as a sweetening
agent in liquid preparations for internal use.
Sucrose may however lower the stability of vitamin B1
and vitamin B12, depending on its concentration and the
pH. Liquid preparations for internal use are also
added with a corrigent, a flavoring agent, a buffer
agent, a preservative and the like. These additives
may also give adverse effects on the stability, thereby
making it more difficult to formulate a liquid preparation
for internal use, which contains vitamin B1 and
vitamin B12.JP 02240025 A2 describes the preparation of
stable aqueous solutions containing vitamins B1 and B12.
The solutions further contain polydextrose as a
stabilizer for the vitamins.An object of the present invention is therefore
to provide a liquid preparation for internal use, which
contains vitamin B1 and vitamin B12 and remains stable 
even when stored for a long period at room temperature.With the foregoing circumstances in view, the
present inventors have proceeded with extensive research.
As a result, it has been found that the above-described
problem can be overcome by the addition of
vitamin B1 and vitamin B12 to a particular solution
base, leading to the
