<ABSTRACT>
An electronic timepiece, which always displays the accurate current local time of 
a city/region without requiring any manual change-over to and from the summer time. 
In an electronic timepiece, to adjust time automatically at change-over to and 
from the summer time, there is provided a city's summer time date memory means (111) 

for storing the starting, the ending, etc. date value of a selection of cities, a summer time 
period comparing means (107) for judging if it is summer time by comparing the time 

calculated by city's current time calculating means (106) with the summer time value 
stored in the city's summer time date memory means (111), a time adjusting means (108) 

for adjusting time when judged by the summer time period comparing means (107) that it 
is summer time, and a displaying means (109) for displaying time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic timepiece in which the displayed time is 
adjusted to compensate for "summer time". The term "summer time" used herein indicates any seasonal variation made to 
standard time. In some places such a variation is made for a particular period of the year 
so that maximum use may be made of daylight hours. The term "summer time" is 
interchangeable with daylight saving time. The term "city" is used herein for the sake of brevity. However, any reference to 
a "city" should be taken as a reference to any type of region, such as a town, state, 
country or the like. One known the type of timepiece is illustrated in Fig. 10 of the drawings, and 
will hereinafter be referred to as a "World Time" timepiece. The World Time timepiece 
comprises a dividing circuit 1002 for dividing the standard signal from an oscillating 
circuit 1001, time counting means 1003 for keeping time using the signal from the 
oscillating circuit 1002, date counting means 1004 for determining the date using the 
signal from the time counting means 1003, city selecting means 1005 for selecting a city, 
and city's current time calculating means 1006 for calculating the local time of the city 
selected by the city selecting means 1005 with the time counting means 1003 and the 
date counting means 1004. A summer time adjusting means 1008 is provided for adding 
an hour to or subtracting an hour from the time calculated by the city's current time 
calculating means 1006 during summer time. The time is displayed by a displaying 
means 1007. A special switch baton is provided in order to control whether the time 
displayed is adjusted to display summer time or not. The provision of such a switch is 
disadvantageous, inter alia, because it adds to the complexity of the timepiece. 
Furthermore, the timepiece will only display the correct time if the user remembers to 
adjust the switch at the beginning and end of summer time. In order to do this, the user 
will have to be aware of the date of the beginning and end of summer time, which varies 
from city to city, country to country, etc.  Fig. 11 shows a second type of timepiece, hereinafter referred to as a "Summer 
Time" timepiece. The Summer Time timepiece comprises a dividing circuit 1102 for 
dividing the standard signal from an oscillating circuit 1101, time counting means 1103 
for keeping time using the signal from the dividing circuit 1102, and date counting 
means 1104 for determining the date using the signal from the time counting means 
1103. A
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electronic timepiece characterised by including a date memory means (111) in 
which the time period during which a seasonal variation is made to the time of a plurality 

of regions are stored, selecting means (105, 110) for selecting one of said plurality of 
regions, and time adjusting means (107, 108) for adjusting the time displayed according 

to the stored time period of the selected region. 
A electronic timepiece according to claim 1, including time calculating means 
(106) for determining the time of the selected region. 
An electronic timepiece according to claim 2, wherein said time calculating 
means includes time value memory means (313) for storing the difference between the 

time of the selected region and the time at a reference region, which stored data is 
accessed by the time calculating means for determining the time of the selected region. 
An electronic timepiece according to claim 1, 2 or 3, comprising a hand which is 
controlled such that it can indicate, at separate times, both time information and the 

selected region. 
An electronic timepiece according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the selecting means 
(105, 110) comprises a rotary bezel switch which is arranged such that different regions 

can be selected according to the degree of rotation of the bezel. 
An electronic timepiece according to any preceding claim, comprising means 
(1612) for altering the time periods stored in said date memory means (111). 
An electronic timepiece comprising: 
   a dividing circuit (102) for dividing the standard signal output from an oscillating 

circuit (101), time counting means (103) for counting time value, etc. with the output 
signal from the oscillating circuit (101), and date counting means (104) for counting the 

date with the output signal from the time counting means (103), characterised by region, 
city or the like selecting means (105) for selecting a region, city or the like, region, city 

or the like designating means (110) for displaying the selected region, city or the like, 
current time calculating means (106) for calculating the local time at the region, city or 

the like selected by the selecting means (105) with the output signal from the time 
counting means (103) and the output signal from the date counting means (104), region, 

city or the like summer time date memory means (111) for memorising such a value as 
the starting and the ending date, etc. of the summer time of the region, city or the like, 

summer time comparing means (107) for judging if it is in the summer time period 

through comparing the time counted by the time calculating means (103) with the 
summer time value memorised in the summer time date memory means (111), time 

adjusting means (108) for adjusting the time in case judged by the summer time 
comparing means (107) that it is in the summer time, and displaying means (100) for 

displaying the adjusted time above.
