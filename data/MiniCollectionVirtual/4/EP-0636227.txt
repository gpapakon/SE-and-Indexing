<ABSTRACT>
A light apparatus is provided for illuminating a subject with ''soft light'', i.e. diffused light that does not cast a defined shadow. The apparatus includes lamp holder (16), a lamp (14), a reflector (12) for reflecting light from the lamp towards the subject, a diffuser or a baffle (23) located in front of the lamp for preventing light from the lamp from passing directly onto the subject; the reflector has a reflecting surface at least 500 mm in diameter and composed of a plurality of convex light-reflecting elements less than 20 mm in diameter; the light reflecting elements (28) constitute at least 90 % (by area) of the reflecting surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of lighting, especially for use in 
television, filming, theatre and photography. In order to soften the shadow edges of high-powered lamps used on film and 
television sets, it is known to reflect light from the lamps off a reflector onto the subject 
being lit. The reflecting surface of the reflector is not smooth and so light reaches the 
subject from several parts of the reflecting surface, thereby giving a soft edge shadow; 
a crinkled or concave stippled sheet of reflecting material has traditionally been used as 
the reflecting surface. Such an arrangement has a low efficiency and provides an 
unsatisfactory penumbra region in the shadow; also a significant proportion of the light 
emitted from the lighting apparatus is wasted and/or is degraded to heat which must be 
ventilated from the apparatus. EP-A-0 430 410 describes a car lamp comprising a bulb and a fresnel 
mirror reflecting light from the bulb in a desired direction. The mirror is constructed 
as a series of annular concentric ridges 
US-A-1 915 842 describes a flood light with a stippled reflector. It is an object of the present invention to provide a lighting apparatus that is 
effective in producing diffused light without sharp shadows (so-called "soft light"). According to the present invention there is provided a lighting apparatus as claimed in the accompanying claims. Light from the individual elements of the reflector will fall on the subject being 
lit and each element can thus cast a separate shadow; however, if the diameter of each 
element is sufficiently small, no multiple shadow edge will, in practice, be discernible to 
an onlooker or, in particular, to a camera filming the scene. We have found that the 
diameter of each element is preferably less than 15 mm and more preferably is less than  
 
10 mm. If each element is too small, reflecting surface becomes more like a plane surface 
and so the harder the shadow will appear. We thus prefer that each element is at least 0.5 
mm in diameter and preferably more than 1 mm in diameter; we have found that an 
optimum diameter is in the range of 2 to 10 e.g. 3 to 9 mm. The element preventing light from passing from the lamp onto the subject can be a diffuser, e.g. a frosted and/or opalescent 
screen, that diffuses such direct light or a baffle or reflector that blocks all direct light 
and generally reflects it back onto the main reflecting surface. It is preferred that each element is immediately adjacent to all its neighbouring 
elemen

A lighting apparatus for illuminating a subject without causing an 
appreciable shadow, which apparatus comprises a holder (16) for holding a lamp, a 

reflector (12) for reflecting light from the lamp towards the subject, an element (23)

diameter of from 0.5 mm to 20 mm, said light reflecting elements constituting at least 
90% (by area) of the reflecting surface.

convex reflecting elements (28) constitute at least 95% (by area) of the area of the 

reflecting surface.

reflecting element has a mirrored surface. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the tangent 

of each convex element at the place where it meets an adjacent element is at an angle (x) 
of 25° to 75°, e.g. 45° to 60°, to the orthogonal to the reflector surface at that place.
