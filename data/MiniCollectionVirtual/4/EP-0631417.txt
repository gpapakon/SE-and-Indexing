<ABSTRACT>
In a radio telephone system control apparatus and 
met
hod, the radio telephone sets 5,5' are arranged to 
receive a paging signal intermittently and at different 

periods of time to one another. A master apparatus 4 
sends a paging signal to the radio telephone sets 5,5'. 

A radio telephone set 5' which receives the paging 
signal responds and the master apparatus 4 sends a 

channel designating signal when it receives the paging 
response signal. The radio telephone set 5' which has 

previously sent the paging response signal then switches 
to the designated channel on receiving the channel 

designating signal. The remaining radio telephone 
set(s) 5, which did not receive the paging signal are 

set to a wait state on receiving the channel designating 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radio telephone system
control apparatus and a method for controlling the connection
of a master apparatus connected to wired telephone
channel and a plurality of radio telephone sets connected
to the master apparatus through radio channels with the
master apparatus, and more particularly an apparatus for
controlling the connection in response to a paging made
through lines for wired telephone sets.Among radio telephone systems comprising a master
apparatus connected to wired telephone channels and one or
more radio telephone sets connected to the master apparatus
through radio channels may be mentioned a so-called
cordless telephone apparatus, for example
c.f. Kawasaki, R.: Cordless Telephone Using
Multi-Channel-Access Technique; Japan
Telecommunication Review, Vol. 26, No. 2
April 1984, Tokyo J.P pages 101-105. The cordless
telephone apparatus is constituted by a master apparatus
connecting apparatus connected to wired telephone channels,
and a wireless telephone set provided for the master
apparatus in a one to one correspondence, and the
frequencies of its signals are fixed such that up radio
channels from the radio telephone sets to the master
apparatus utilizes signals of frequency f1, while down 
telephone channels from the master apparatus to the radio
telephone sets utilize signals of frequency f2. As a
consequence, where two radio telephone sets are utilized,
it is necessary to install two master apparatus.With such a radio telephone system utilizing two
radio telephone sets and two master apparatus, however,
two radio telephone sets are not usually used simultaneously,
so that provision of two master apparatus is not
economical.In recent years, for the purpose of efficiently
utilizing allocated frequencies, a so-called multi-channel
access system has been adopted wherein a frequency being
used is determined by utilizing a common channel, for
example, a control channel between a plurality of master
apparatus, and then the channel is switched to a speech
channel corresponding to the frequency. However, when
such multi-channel access system is adopted, there is a
problem in the case where a master apparatus is provided
for each of the two radio telephone sets that a paging is
made from a wired telephone set, the two master apparatus
start connection control using respective control channels
simultaneously, whereby radio waves from these control
channels interface with each other. Thus, the connection
control is sometimes made impossible.It is therefore an object of
