<ABSTRACT>
An information recording-reproduction method wherein: 
upon reproducing, recorded information corresponding to a 

predetermined number of sectors from the leading sector of 
each of a plurality of information tracks on an optical 

disk (1) is preliminarily stored on a buffer memory (19), and 
during a period in which the optical pickup (3) is shifted to 

another information track, the recording information, 
stored in the buffer memory (19), is reproduced; and upon 

recording, during a period in which the optical pickup (3) is 
shifted to another information track, recording 

information is temporarily stored in the buffer memory (19), 
and after completion of the recording, the recording 

information is recorded on the optical disk (1). In this 
method, information tracks, which are formed on the 

optical disk discontinuously with one another, are 
regarded as if they were continuous tracks, and the 

apparent recording and reproducing operation is carried 
out continuously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention, which is applied to, for
example, information processing apparatuses, such as
magneto-optical-disk recording-reproduction apparatuses
using magneto-optical disks and compact-disk reproduction
apparatuses, relates to an information recording-reproduction
method for recording and reproducing digital
information by using a recording medium having a plurality
of information tracks formed into spiral shapes.Conventionally, an optical-disk recording-reproduction
apparatus has been used for recording and
reproducing, for example, digital video information, that 
is, consecutive digital information. In such an
apparatus, for example, as illustrated in Fig. 6, an
optical disk 1 is used as a recording medium, whereon
information tracks in the shape of spirals are formed
discontinuously with each other.This optical disk is provided with the first spiral
information track 26 and the second spiral information
track 27, both of which are the information tracks in the
shape of spirals. For example, the CLV (Constant Linear
Velocity) system is adopted for its recording format.Moreover, for example, as illustrated in Fig. 9,
recording and reproducing operations are available in the
above-mentioned apparatus: upon recording, analog video
information is inputted through an input terminal 124, and
is converted into digital video information in an A/D
converter 114.The digital video information, made through the
conversion, is inputted to an information-compression
processing circuit 120. In the above-mentioned circuit
120, an information-compressing operation is carried out,
wherein, for example, the amount of data, approximately
160 M bps (bit per second), which has been converted to
digital video information of the current television signal
(NTSC system), is compressed into the amount of data,
approximately 5 M bps. The information, thus compressed, is further
converted into a form suitable for recording in a
recording-data processing circuit 111, and is applied to a
coil 104 through a coil driver 105. Thus, the coil 104
applies a modulated magnetic field corresponding to the
recording information to an optical disk 1.Meanwhile, upon receipt of an instruction from a
controller 116, a laser driver 106 allows an optical
pickup 103 to project a light beam of high power onto the
optical disk 1, and the temperature of the optical disk 1
is thus raised locally so as to allow desired information
to be recorded thereon.Additionally, absolute addresses are preliminarily
recorded on the optical disk 1 as
