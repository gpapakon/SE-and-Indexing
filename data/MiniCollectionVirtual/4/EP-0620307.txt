<ABSTRACT>
A method for surface treatment of wet fabric webs 
in a finishing machine containing an external housing, 

provided with an inlet zone and an outlet zone, through 
which a fabric web to be treated is run, and at least 

one grinder roller rotatably arranged inside it, 
against which said fabric web is caused to slide, in 

which method the surface treatment of the fabric is 
carried out by using abrasive diamond material as the 

grinding material for the grinder roller. 
Furthermore, a finishing machine for surface 
treatment of wet fabrics is discussed, which comprises 

an external housing (12), provided with an inlet zone 
and an outlet zone, through which a fabric web to be 

treated (11) is caused to run, and at least one grinder 
roller rotatably arranged inside it, against which the 

fabric web (11) is caused to run, in which, in order to 
carry out the treatment, the grinder roller (13, 15) is 

provided with an external surface equipped with 
abrasive diamond material (14, 17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relate to a method and an 
apparatus for surface treatment of wet fabric webs in a 
finishing machine. At present, methods and apparatuses are known and 
used which, in order to carry out the surface treatment 
of dry fabrics, use one or more revolutionary rollers 
coated with a conventional abrasive tape. Such a treatment method, usually referred to as 
"fluffing", makes it possible a treated fabric to be 
manufactured, from the surface of which some fibrous 
material has been partially removed. Consequently, the 
fabric displays a more or less marked surface fluff. In 
that way, a modification is accomplished in the treated 
fabric from both the visual and tactile viewpoints, 
which unfortunately causes, as a negative 
characteristic, a certain loss of strength of said 
fabric. Furthermore, the use of the abrasive tape implies 
the drawback that it does not allow the surface 
treatment of wet fabrics to be carried out owing to the 
sudden degradation of said tape, which must be 
frequently replaced. However, the need exists always for obtaining new 
"hand" and visual surface effects. For example, hand 
effects are required which are such as to soften the 
fabric while simultaneously preventing surface grind to 
be formed. Furthermore, also visual effects are 
required which determine a fabric appearance which  
 
resembles a discoloration and/or ageing, as shown by an 
already used fabric. The purpose of the present invention is hence of 
providing a solution for the above requirements through 
methods and apparatuses which overcome the drawbacks 
and disadvantages of the methods and apparatuses 
already known and used in the prior art. This purpose according to the present invention is 
achieved by providing a method for surface treatment of 
wet fabric webs in a finishing machine containing an 
external housing, provided with an inlet zone and an 
outlet zone, through which a fabric web to be treated 
is run, and at least one grinder roller rotatably 
arranged inside it, against which said fabric web is 
caused to slide, characterized in that the surface 
treatment of the fabric is carried out by using 
abrasive diamond material as the grinding material for 
the grinder roller. Furthermore, according to the present invention, a 
finishing machine for surface treatment of wet fabrics 
is proposed, which comprises an external housing, 
provided with an inlet zone and an outlet zone, through 
which a fabric web to be treated is caused to run, and 
at least one grinder roller

fabrics, which comprises an external housing (12), 

provided with an inlet zone and an outlet zone, through  
 

which a fabric web (11) to be treated is caused to run, 
and at least one grinder roller rotatably arranged 

inside it, against which the fabric web (11) is caused 
to slide, characterized in that, in order to carry out 

said fabric surface treatment, the grinder roller (13,
