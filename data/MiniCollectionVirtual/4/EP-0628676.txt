<ABSTRACT>
An inner window reveal (3), in particular for a flat roof window (2), consists partly of chromium-nickel sheet steel which is polished to a high lustre. It consequently exhibits reflective surfaces (30), on which diffuse and direct sunlight is reflected to the maximum extent. There is thus a greater amount of light in the attic room (D), and the room has better light.

<CLAIMS>
Interior window embrasure (3), especially for roof windows (2), which has at
least one reflective face, characterised in that the one or more reflective

faces have angles of inclination such that the quantity of light entering a room
is increased.
Interior window embrasure according to Claim 1, characterised in that it has
two reflective lateral faces (30).
Interior window embrasure according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
reflective side faces (30) are inclined with respect to the perpendicular of the

window surface.
Interior window embrasure according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
reflective lateral faces (30) in the area (30') close to the window have an

inclination which diverges more sharply from the perpendicular of the window
surface than in the area (30") furthest from the window.
Interior window embrasure according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
lateral faces (30) have two part-faces (30',30") with different angles of

inclination.
Interior window embrasure according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
difference between the angles of inclination of the part-faces (30', 30") is

approximately 20Â°.
Interior window embrasure according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
reflective part of the window embrasure (3) consists of highly-polished

chrome nickel steel sheet.
Interior window embrasure according to one of the Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that each lateral face (30) is made of a single piece of the

reflective material, which piece has fixing means (32) at its edge furthest from
the window, by means of which the lateral faces (30) can be fixed to the rafter

(11).
Interior window embrasure according to one of the Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that it can be assembled at least partially in a modular

manner.
