<ABSTRACT>
Seat upholstery comprising at least one thin layer (1) of an elastomer in which is partially embedded a continuous layer (2) of helical springs, the axes of which lie substantially parallel to the faces of said elastomer layer (1). The layer (2) of springs protrudes from only one side of the elastomer layer (1).

Upholstery for a seat characterised in that it comprises at least 
one thin layer (1) of a compact elastomer, in which layer there is partially 

embedded a continuous layer array (2) of coil springs with their axes 
substantially parallel to the faces of said layer (1), the layer array (2) 

of springs projecting on just one side out of the layer (1) of compact 
elastomer. 
Upholstery according to claim 1 characterised in that the layer 
array (2) of springs projects out of the layer (1) of compact elastomer by a 

thickness representing approximately 60 to 70% of the diameter of the turns 
of the springs. 
A seat element comprising upholstery according to one of claims 1 
and 2 which is fixed with respect to a framework (4), said seat element 

being characterised in that interposed between the upholstery and the 
framework is a layer (5) of an expanded polymer which is of a thickness 

greater than that of the layer (1) of compact elastomer of the upholstery 
and which supports the face thereof from which the layer array (2) of 

springs projects, the part of said layer array (2) which emerges from the 
layer (1) of compact elastomer being embedded in the layer (5) of expanded 

polymer. 
A seat element according to claim 3 characterised in that it 
comprises a plurality of contiguous portions of upholstery according to one 

of claims 1 and 2 which are assembled and held in shape by the same layer 
(5) of an expanded polymer, in which are embedded the parts of the turns of 

the springs which emerge from the layer (5) of compact elastomer of each of 
said upholstery portions. 
A seat element according to one of claims 3 and 4 characterised in 
that the external face of the layer (1) of compact elastomer is covered by a 

sheet (6) of fabric, which conceals the framework from sight and which can 
be fixed to said framework.  

 
A process for the production of a seat element provided with one or 
more parts of upholstery according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in 

that said upholstery is shaped, that a mixture of a polymerisable liquid 
resin which is capable of expanding is applied to said upholstery on the 

side of the layer array (2) of springs, that said mixture is subjected to 
conditions such as to cause polymerisation and expansion of said resin to 

form a layer of expanded polymer supporting the layer (1) of compact 
elastomer of the upholstery, and in which is embedded the part of the layer 

array (2) of the springs of said upholstery which emerges from the layer of 
compact elastomer, that the upholstery provided with said layer (5) of 

expanded polymer is disposed on a framework with the layer of compact 
elastomer (1) directed outwardly, and that the resulting assembly is covered 

with a covering of fabric (6).
