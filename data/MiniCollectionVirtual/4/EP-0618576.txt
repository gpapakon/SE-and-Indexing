<ABSTRACT>
A digital data modulation system having, a separator for 
separating a consecutive binary data sequence to four-bit 

code-words, a four-to-nine ([4.9]) converter for converting 

the four-bit code-words into nine-bit modulated code-words 
and a code selector for selecting a code among nine-bit code-words 

containing minimum three bits of "0" between a 
preceeding bit of "1" and its following bit of "1" so that 

there should not be less than two consecutive bits of "0" 
between a selecting code and a modulated code-word which is 

to be converted later by the [4.9] converter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a digital data 
modulation/demodulation system, and more particularly to a 
modulator/demodulator which is used for digital data 
recording/reproducing to/from optical discs etc., or 
communication transmission. As, there are an EFM (Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation) 
system using fixed length words used for an audio-soft or 
audio signal storing CD (Compact Disc) as disclosed in the 
Japanese Patent Disclosure (Tokkai-Sho) 57-48848 (now granted 
as Tokko-Hei 05-19332) and a Run-Length Limited two-to-seven 
(hereinafter referred to as RLL [2,7]) modulation system 
adopted for writable optical disc, as disclosed in the 
Japanese Patent Disclosure (Tokkai-Sho) 50-142131 (or 
corresponding USP 3.689.899). However, there was such a problem that in order to 
achieve more high-density recording in the conventional EFM 
modulation system and a two-to-seven (hereinafter referred to 
as [2,7]) modulation system, a short-wave laser had to be 
developed while it couldn't be able to fully cope with the 
realization of large capacity storage media for image data 
etc., which are currently under development. In the modulation systems described above, regarding 
modulated codes after conversion, such characteristic  
 
parameters as a bit interval T, a minimum inversion interval 
Tmin, a maximum inversion interval Tmax, a detection window 
width Tw, a digital sum value DSV, etc., have been 
established. In particular, when it is intended to achieve 
the high-density recording, it is necessary to make the 
minimum inversion interval Tmin and the detection window 
width Tw large while keeping the maximum inversion interval 
Tmax as small as possible. The minimum inversion interval 
Tmin is the most important parameter as it directly affects 
the shortest bit length that can be reconstructed on an 
optical disc. Here, a shortest writable or readable bit length on a 
disc is determined by an attribute of the light source, i.e., 
a wavelength of a laser beam generated from an optical head 
for writing or reading optical data on a disc, as well as a 
numerical aperture NA of an optical objective lens to 
minimize a light spot diameter as small as possible, etc. 
Therefore, in order to make the bit length more short and 
increase a recording density, it is needed to develop a laser 
with short wavelength beam and expand the numerical aperture 
NA, but it was difficult to limit a writable disc bit length 
to below a fixed value as it was difficult to use them in 
practical use. Thus, in
