<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-adhesive label 
carried on a backing of release material and to a method of 
producing a succession of self-adhesive labels carried on a 
backing of release material. The present invention particularly relates to 
self-adhesive labels in the form of a tag having an aperture 
into which a neck of a bottle may be received. EP-A-0306125 discloses a tag attachment system for the 
application of tags to the necks of bottles. The tags suffer 
from the disadvantage that tag presents only a relatively 
limited area for carrying printed information and in addition 
the construction is rather complicated which renders the tag 
relatively expensive to produce. GB-A-2207411 discloses a 
label including a tear-off portion which is insertable into a 
pocket of the label. DE-U-8 611 782 discloses a label comprising a folded sheet adhered to a tag for attachment to the neck of a bottle. The present invention aims to overcome the disadvantages 
of known tags. Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
self-adhesive label in the form of a tag for attachment to a 
neck of a bottle, the label being carried on a backing of 
release material, the label comprising a printed sheet which 
is folded so as to form a body portion and tag portion 
adjacent thereto, the printed sheet being folded about at 
least one longitudinal fold line so as to form a multiple-ply 
strip and the multiple-ply strip being folded about at least 
one transverse fold line to form the body and tag portions, 
an aperture which extends through the tag portion, a weakened 
tear line which extends through the sheet between the body 
and tag portions, and a layer of adhesive disposed on a 
rearwardly directed surface of the body portion which 
releasably adheres the label to the backing of release 
material and by which the body portion may be adhered to a 
bottle. The present invention also provides a method of 
producing a succession of self-adhesive labels carried on a 
backing of release material, the method comprising the steps 
of:- (a) providing a plurality of printed sheets; (b) folding  
 
each printed sheet to form a body portion and an adjacent tag 
portion; (c) providing a web of release material carrying a 
series of patches of adhesive; (d) applying the folded 
printed sheets in succession to respective patches of 
adhesive; and (e) die-cutting through each folded printed 
sheet to form an aperture through each tag portion whereby 
the tag portion may be attached to a neck of a bottle and a 
weakened
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A self-adhesive label in the form of a tag for 
attachment to a neck of a bottle (55), the label being carried on 

a backing of release material (34), the label comprising a printed 
sheet (2) which is folded so as to form a body portion (30) and tag 

portion (32) adjacent thereto, characterized in that the printed sheet is folded 

about at least one longitudinal fold line (4,6,8) so as to form a 
multiple-ply strip (24) and the multiple-ply strip is folded 

about at least one transverse fold line (10,12) to form the body and 
tag portions, an aperture (52) extends through the tag 

portion, a weakened tear line extends through the sheet 
between the body and tag portions, and in that a layer of adhesive (38) 

disposed on a rearwardly directed surface of the body portion 
releasably adheres the label to the backing of release 

material and allows the body portion to be adhered to the 
bottle. 
A self-adhesive label according to claim 1, wherein 
further comprising a first adhesive region (20) which adheres 

together the plies of the sheet (2) forming the tag portion (32). 
A self-adhesive label according to claim 2, further 
comprising a second adhesive region (26) which releasably adheres 

together two adjacent folded parts of the body portion (30) so as 
temporarily to retain the body portion in a folded 

configuration. 
A self-adhesive label according to any foregoing claim 
further comprising an aperture in the backing of release 

material which is coextensive with the aperture (52) in the tag 
portion (32).  

 
A self-adhesive label according to any foregoing claim 
wherein the layer of adhesive (38) disposed on the body portion is 

a dry peel adhesive. 
A method of producing a succession of self-adhesive 
labels carried on a backing of release material, the method 

comprising the steps of:- 

(a) providing a plurality of printed sheets; 
(b) folding each printed sheet (2) to form a body portion (30) 
and an adjacent tag portion (32); 
(c) providing a web of release material (34) carrying a 
series of patches of adhesive (38); 
(d) applying the folded printed sheets in succession to 
respective patches of adhesive; and 
(e) die-cutting through each folded printed sheet to 
form an aperture (52) through each tag portion (32) whereby the tag 

portion may be attached to a neck (56) of a bottle (55) and a weakened 
tear line (46) which extends through the sheet between the body 

and tag portions. 
A method according to claim 6, wherein in die-cutting 
step (e) the aperture (52) is additionally cut through the 

adjacent release material (34) and the cut-out parts of the tag 
portion and the release material are blown away from the web 

carrying the labels thereon. 
A method according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein in 
folding step (b) the printed sheet is folded about at least 

one longitudinal fold line (4,6,8) so as to form a multiple-ply strip (24) 
and the multiple-ply strip is folded about at least one 

transverse fold line (10,12). 
A method according to claim 8, further comprising the 
step of adhering together the plies of the sheet forming the 

tag portion so as to retain the tag portion (32) in a folded 
configuration.  

 
A method according to claim 8 or claim 9, further 
comprising adhering together two adjacent folded parts of the 

body portion (30) so as temporarily to retain the body portion in 
a folded configuration. 
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 10, wherein 
the patches of adhesive (38) are composed of dry peel adhesive.
