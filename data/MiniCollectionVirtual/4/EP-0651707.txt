<ABSTRACT>
In order to continuously adjust the distance between a reaction disk and the second part of a valve piston having two parts which co-operates with the reaction disk (the so-called z dimension) in a completely assembled vacuum brake servo already mounted in a motor vehicle, a tubular sleeve (32) coaxial to a piston rod (7) which actuates the valve piston (8) engages the first part (21) of the valve piston (8) which is linked to the second part (22) of the valve piston by a thread and transmits a torque to the first part (21) of the piston. For that purpose, the sleeve (32) is provided at its end that projects out of the control housing (5) with an extension (42) which allows the sleeve (32) to be rotated.

A vacuum brake power booster including a booster housing 
(10) which is sealingly subdivided by an axially movable 

wall (4) into a vacuum chamber (20) and a power chamber 
(23), the wall (4) being subjectible to a pneumatic 

pressure differential, and a control valve (11) which 
controls the pressure differential and is accommodated 

within a control housing (5) and actuatable by a valve 
piston (8), that is slidable by means of a piston rod (7) 

and is in a force-transmitting connection with a 
force-delivering member (16) through an elastic reaction 

disc (15), the valve piston including a first piston part 
(21) which interacts with the piston rod (7) and is 

rotatably supported within the control housing (5), and a 
second piston part (22) which is guided within the control 

housing (5) so as to be secured against rotation and is in 
abutment against the reaction disc (15), the first and 

second piston parts being coupled to each other by means of 
a threaded union so as to be movable relative to each other 

within limits in an axial direction,
characterized
 in that a tubular sleeve (32) 
which is arranged coaxially to the piston rod (7) is in 

engagement with the first piston part (21), the sleeve (32) 
having an extension (42) at its end projecting from the 

control housing (5) which permits rotation of the sleeve 
(32).  

 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the extension (42) 
includes means (43, 48) for permitting manual adjustment of 

the sleeve (32). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the extension (42) 
includes means (49, 50, 51, 52, 53) for permitting the 

electromechanical adjustment of the sleeve (32). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that the means comprises an 
electric motor (49) which drives the sleeve (32). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the electric motor (49) 
is arranged coaxially to the sleeve (32). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 4 or claim 
5,
characterized
 by further comprising means 
(54) for permitting actuation of the electric motor (49) in 

response to the load condition of the vehicle. 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 6,
characterized
 in that the means includes a 
load sensor (54) which cooperates with an evaluating 

electronics (55) that produces control signals to actuate 
the electric motor (49).  

 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the sleeve (32) has a 
radially enlarged portion (43) at its end to receive means 

(44 to 47) for limiting the range of adjustment. 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the means for limiting 
the range of adjustment comprises a check nut (44) which is 

arranged on the piston rod (7) so as to be adjustable 
within limits in an axial direction and interacts with a 

stop (45) provided on the piston rod (7). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claim 9,
characterized
 in that the stop (45) on the 
piston rod (7) is axially adjustable, the stop taking the 

form of a stop nut (46), for example, which is secured 
against axial re-adjustment by a counter nut (47). 
A vacuum brake power booster as claimed in claims 8 to 10, 
and claims 4, 6 or 7,
characterized
 in that the enlarged portion 
(43) is part of a gear unit (50) positioned between the 

sleeve (32) and the electric motor (49).
