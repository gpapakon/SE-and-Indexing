<ABSTRACT>
A seal particularly suitable for a security bag in which there are two generally coextensive layers of ink and adhesive, in different patterns. The ink layer is therefore broken up by the adhesive and its own pattern obviously disrupted in the event of tampering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tamper indicating
packages and labels, and in particular, to packages made of
plastics materials, of a type which are commonly used for
transporting cash or other valuables, and which are arranged
so as to ensure that no tampering with the contents is
possible, without such tampering being made immediately
obvious on inspection.One known system of this kind is shown in our
WO91/04199 entitled
"Tamper Indicating Package", which discloses, inter-alia, a
tamper indicating sealing tape, label or package including a
transparent or translucent flexible plastics base material,
a pattern printed on the base material in a silicone
acrylate which forms a discontinuous release layer, a layer
of opaque ink applied over the release pattern, and a layer
of adhesive applied over the opaque ink.The effect of this arrangement is that if the seal
is peeled apart, the ink will be left on the base material,
in the intervening spaces formed by the silicone acrylate
release pattern, whereas they will come away from the base
film, in the filled areas of the silicone acrylate pattern,
because the adhesive will cause them to adhere more strongly
to the overlying material in those areas.The pattern of the release layer preferably spells
out some wording such as "void", and thus, if the ink layer
is opaque, and the base film is transparent or translucent,
these words will be revealed, as soon as the seal is pulled
apart, and it will then be very difficult for the
interrupted areas of ink to be reconstituted in such a way
that the wording is no longer visible.Basically, systems of this kind depend on the fact 
that the ink has low cohesive strength, and will adhere to
whichever surface has the greatest surface energy. In
particular, seals of this kind are useful to prevent opening
of the bag by freezing it, which reduces the adhesivity of
the adhesive. In most such existing systems, the adhesive
layer, and the ink layer are made continuous, and the
discontinuities are provided by the silicone release layer.
However, such an arrangement does have the disadvantage that
it is necessary to apply three successive coatings to the
material, i.e. the release layer, the ink, and the adhesive.The present invention therefore seeks to provide a
tamper evident sealing system which has improved performance
and at the same time is simpler to manufacture.Accordingly, the present invention provides a
closure for a security bag or a security label, comprising a
seal for two surfaces which can be contacted together to
close
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A closure for a security bag or a security label,
comprising a seal for two surfaces which can be contacted

together to close the seal, and including an ink pattern and
an adhesive pattern, characterised in that both patterns are

comprised of sets of strips or lines which are so arranged that they
overlap, but do not match, at least after the seal has been

closed.
A closure according to claim 1, in which the ink
pattern is applied to one of the surfaces, and the adhesive

pattern is then applied over the ink pattern.
A closure according to claim 1 in which the
adhesive pattern is applied to one of the surfaces, and the

ink pattern is then applied over the adhesive pattern.
A closure according to any preceding claim in
which the ink is applied by means of an ink jet printer.
A closure according to claim 1 in which the ink
pattern is applied to one of the surfaces, and the adhesive

pattern is applied to the other surface.
A closure according to any preceding claim in which
the adhesive strips are laid down in an undulating pattern by moving

the extruder head and the receiving substrate relatively to
one another.
A closure according to any of claims 1 to 6
for a bag made from polythene, in which the ink is based on

nitro-cellulose and polyamides.
A security bag having a closure according to claim 7,

the bag being made from polythene, in which the ink
also includes wax and/or titanium esters. 
A closure according to any of claims 1 to 6
in which the ink is based on nitro-cellulose urethanes and

includes titanates.
