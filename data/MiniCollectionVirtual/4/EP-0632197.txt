<ABSTRACT>
The divergent nozzle (14) of the rocket motor jet pipe (nozzle) (10) is extended in its downstream part by an ejectable diffuser (20) which, downstream of the region by which it is connected to the divergent nozzle (14), has a region (25) of smaller cross-section (S1) so that in a first phase of flight in the presence of a significant external pressure it recompresses the stream of hot gases and prevents the stream from detaching along the wall of the divergent nozzle. The ejectable diffuser (20) may have a shaped throat (25) which constitutes the said region of smaller cross-section (S1).

A rocket engine nozzle with an ejectable diffuser for the first 
stage of a launcher, comprising a convergent portion (12) which receives 

the gases produced in a combustion chamber (13), a nozzle throat (11) of 
small cross-section (So) and a diverging part (14) connected to the nozzle 

throat (11) and terminating at its downstream portion (15) in a gas outlet 
cross-section (Se) which defines a high cross-section ratio (ε = Se/So) 

greater than about 50,
 
   characterised in that the downstream portion of the diverging part 

(14) is extended by an ejectable diffuser (20; 50) which, downstream from 
the zone where it is connected to the diverging part (14), presents a zone 

(25; 51) of smaller cross-section (S
1
) that acts during a first stage of flight 
in the presence of significant outside pressure to recompress the flow of hot 

gases and to prevent a flow separation from appearing along the wall of the 
diverging part. 
The nozzle according to claim 1, characterised in that the cross-section 
(S
1
) of the zone (25; 51) of the diffuser (20; 50) of smaller cross-section 
constitutes about 15% to 45% of the outlet cross-section (Se) of the 

diverging part (14). 
The nozzle according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that 
the ejectable diffuser (50) has an essentially frusto-conical shape with an 

angle of inclination (α) less than or equal to about 20° with respect to a 
direction parallel to the axis of the nozzle. 
The nozzle according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that 
the ejectable diffuser (20) has a streamlined throat (25) which constitutes 

said zone of smaller cross-section (S
1
). 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the ejectable diffuser (20; 50) is made up of a plurality of parts (21 to 

24). 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the inside surface of the diverging part (14) includes longitudinal ribs 

(61) which extend beyond its downstream end and co-operate with 
longitudinal grooves (62) formed on the inside surface of the releasable 

diffuser (20; 50).  
 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the inside surface of the releasable diffuser (20; 50) includes 

longitudinal ribs (72) which extend beyond the upstream end of the diffuser 
and co-operate with longitudinal grooves (71) formed on the inside surface 

of the diverging part (14). 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the releasable diffuser (20; 50) comprises means (80) for selectively 

connecting it to the downstream end (15) of the diverging part (14) and in 
that the rupture of these connection means (80) is remotely controlled. 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the means (80) for connecting the releasable diffuser (20;50) to the 

downstream end (15) of the diverging part (14) comprise means configured 
so as to break automatically after a predetermined operating time. 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the means (80) for connecting the releasable diffuser (20;50) to the 

downstream end (15) of the diverging part (14) comprise an assembly of 
hinged clamps (81) which grip flanges (15a, 92) formed at the contacting 

ends of the diverging part (14) and of the releasable diffuser (20;50), and a 
retaining system (85, 86) for the clamps which is equipped with unlocking 

means selectively controllable to allow release of the diffuser (20; 50) once 
the risk of separation of the gas jet inside the diverging part (14) has 

passed.
