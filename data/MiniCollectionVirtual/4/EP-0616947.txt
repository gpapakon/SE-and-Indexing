<ABSTRACT>
In a hand-held labeller (1) for dispensing and affixing labels, with a hand lever mounted pivotably on a housing (2) and driving a transport device (6), operation is optimised in that the hand lever (7) consists of at least two constructional elements, the first constructional element being designed as a grip shell (12) fixed pivotably to the housing (2), and a grip part (13) being mounted movably, especially pendulously, as a second constructional element in the grip shell (12).

Hand labelling device for dispensing and fitting of 
labels, with a hand lever (7) operating a transport device (6) 

and mounted so as to pivot on a housing (2), which hand lever 
has a handle shell (12) fixed so as to pivot on a housing (2), 


characterized in that
 the hand lever (7) consists of at least 
two components, whereby the first component is the handle shell 

(12) and the second component is a handle element (13) mounted 
in the handle shell (12) so as to be able to oscillate, and 

also means of resetting, e.g. restoring springs, are provided 
for a defined normal position of the handle element (13) in the 

handle shell (12). 
Hand labelling device according to claim 1 and 

characterized in that
 the oscillating axis (20) of the handle 
element (13) lies in the normal plane of the swivelling axis of 

the handle shell (12).  
 
Hand labelling device according to claims 1 or 2 and 

characterized in that
 the oscillating axis (20) and the 
swivelling axis of the handle shell (12) intersect. 
Hand labelling device according to one of the previous 
claims and 
characterized in that
 the handle element (13) can be 
deflected to both sides of the handle shell (12), in particular 

by 180Â° respectively. 
Hand labelling device according to one of the previous 
claims and 
characterized in that
 the oscillating axis (20) 
penetrates the handle element (13). 
Hand labelling device according to one of claims 1 to 4 
and 
characterized in that
 the oscillating axis (20) of the 
handle element (13) is at a distance (A) from the centre of 

gravity axis (24) of the area to be affected. 
Hand labelling device according to one of the previous 
claims and 
characterized in that
 the handle element (13) is 
braked or cushioned against the handle shell (12) by means of a 

defined friction.  
 
Hand labelling device according to one of the previous 
claims and 
characterized in that
 the deflection of the handle 
element (13) is limited by means of stops (21 and 22). 
Hand labelling device according to one of the previous 
claims and 
characterized in that
 the handle element (13) is 
mounted slightly displaceably in the direction of the 

oscillating axis (20).
