<ABSTRACT>
A security door comprises first and second sheet metal door 
panel members (10, 20), a pair of internal side rails (30, 31) 

and a top and bottom rail (40, 41). Each of the door panel 
members (10, 20) has overturned lip formations (11, 21) along 

its edges, the free ends of which overlie their respective door 
panel member (10, 20) in spaced-apart relationship thereto. 

The rails (30, 31, 40, 41) have a pair of longitudinal grooves 
(32, 42) along at least one of their faces, which grooves 

receive the overturned lip formations (11, 21) of respective 
door panel members (10, 20). Between their grooves (32, 42), 

the rails may have recesses (33, 34) adapted to receive hinges, 
locking mechanisms or the like. The rails may be double-sided 

with different recess formations on opposite sides. The 
constructional features of the door are concealed from view 

when the door is closed in use and hence are not vulnerable to 
attack. For aesthetic purposes, a capping member (50) may be 

attached around the door periphery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to doors and in particular 
to security doors of the type which may be fitted in secure 
premises. Such doors may also find use as domestic front entry 
doors and in community housing projects where added security 
is desired. A security door is known from granted European Patent No. 
0 392 700 B in which the leaf is constructed from a minor sheet 
metal tray and a major sheet metal tray, each of which is 
formed with lip portions receivable in slotted internal frame 
members. The respective trays are effectively bent metal 
sheets and the internal frame members are elongate metal 
extrusions. The cavity inside the assembled door may be filled 
under pressure with a curable foam material. One of the disadvantages of a door of this known 
construction is the fact that its two faces are different in 
appearance. The outer face of the major tray presents a 
unitary panel to the viewer and in use it will be this side 
which is generally offered as the external panel of the door. 
The reverse, which is therefore generally the internal panel, 
comprises the outer face of the minor tray surrounded by a 
returned portion of the major tray. There is a visible seam 
around the entire periphery of the minor tray. In practice, 
this means that the external and internal panels of the door 
must be given the same finish, which may not be to the personal 
taste of the user. Also, the seam is a point of vulnerability. Another drawback of this prior art door is the "wrap-around" 
construction of the major tray. This makes it 
particularly difficult to form the corners of the major tray. 
If the material from which the door is constructed is a 
plastic-coated steel such as "Plastisol" (Registered Trade 
Mark), the corners of the major tray will need to be secured 
using fasteners such as pop rivets, rather than using a 
stronger welded construction. Moreover, because of the 
returned portions, it is necessary to rotate the internal frame  
 
members into position under the returned lips. This is not 
possible in the corners, which are therefore unreinforced and 
a potential site of weakness. The wrap-around construction of the major tray may also 
mean that it is not possible for a would-be customer to obtain 
doors of sufficient width, since the returned portions account 
for between 10 and 15cm of the metal sheet from which the door 
is constructed. Many sheet materials are supplied in standard 
widths and it may therefore be the case that a door cannot be 
made to the prior art design in

<CLAIMS>
A door comprising first and second sheet metal door panel 
members (10, 20), a pair of side rails (30, 31) and a top and 

bottom rail (40, 41), characterised in that each of said door 
panel members (10, 20) is provided with overturned lip 

formations (11, 21) around each of its edges, the free ends of 
said overturned lip formations (11, 21) overlying their 

respective door panel members (10, 20) and being spaced 
therefrom, and in that each of said rails (30, 31, 40, 41) is 

provided with a pair of parallel longitudinal grooves (32, 42) 
along at least one common face thereof dimensioned to receive 

the overturned lip formations (11, 21) of corresponding edges 
of each of said first and second door panel members (10, 20). 
A door as claimed in claim 1 wherein at least one of the 
pairs (30 and 31, 40 and 41) of oppositely-disposed rails 

includes extension means (43, 44, 45). 
A door as claimed in claim 2 wherein said extension means 
comprise telescopic portions (43) incorporated into the rails. 
A door as claimed in claim 2 wherein the extension means 
comprise insert portions for incorporation between the rail 

ends. 
A door as claimed in claim 4 wherein the insert portions 
and rails have complementary bevelled formations to assist in 

urging the rail ends into respective corners of the door panel 
members through a wedging action. 
A door as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said rails 
(30, 31, 40, 41) are formed with a pair of said longitudinal 

grooves (32) along two opposite faces and with a longitudinal 
recess (33, 34) of a different depth formed between each pair 

of said longitudinal grooves (32). 
A door as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the rails 
(30, 31, 40, 41) are formed of an elongate metal extrusion. 
A door as claimed in any preceding claim wherein a capping 
member (50) is attached around the periphery of the door. 
A door as claimed in claim 8 wherein the capping member 
(50) has returned edge portions (51), said returned edge 

portions (51) and said overturned lip formations (11, 21) 
together forming an interference fit in said parallel grooves 

(32, 42). 
A door as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the 
overturned lip formations (11, 21) are continuous around the 

entire periphery of said first and second door panel members 
(10, 20). 
A door as claimed in claim 10 wherein the cavity between 
said panel members (10, 20) is filled with a curable foam 

material (60). 
A door as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10 wherein the 
cavity between said panel members is filled with a non-curable 

material (70). 
A door as claimed in claim 12 wherein jacking mechanisms 
(80) are provided for urging the rails (30, 31, 40, 41) into 

firm engagement with said overturned lip formations (11,12).
