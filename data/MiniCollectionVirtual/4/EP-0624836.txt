<ABSTRACT>
A movable valve body (70) for determining a mixing ratio of hot water and cold water is actuated by using 
a heat-sensitive coil spring (80) made of a material the spring constant of which changes with temperature, so as to 

eliminate the deviation of the actual temperature from a target temperature. When the temperature deviation cannot 

be eliminated by the temperature control by the coil spring (80) alone, it is eliminated by feedback control. A control 
gain K of this feedback control is determined on the basis of the rate of change in the spring constant in order to 

prevent hunting, etc. When the temperature deviation is eliminated by the feedback control, the relation between 
the target temperature and the present load adjustment quantity is stored, and the latter is used when the next target 

temperature is set.. The feedback control is not carried out at the start of tapping or at the time of the change of the 
target temperature until the temperature deviation becomes smaller than a threshold value (TR1) in order to prevent 

hot water from being supplied after dead water has been discharged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination 
faucet, and more specifically to a combination faucet 
for mixing hot water with cold water by pressing a 
movable valve disc with a spring, which is composed of a 
material having a spring constant varied with the 
temperature. An automatic temperature controlling combination 
faucet previously proposed steadily controls the 
temperature of a water mixture of hot water and cold 
water by pressing a movable valve disc for controlling a 
mixing ratio of hot water to cold water with a shape 
memory alloy, which has a shape varied with the 
temperature (JAPANESE PATENT PUBLICATION GAZETTE No. 
61-44062). As generally known, even if a physical force 
is applied to change the shape of a shape memory alloy 
having an original shape set at a specific temperature, 
the shape memory alloy recovers its original shape any 
time when it is exposed to the specific temperature. The 
shape memory alloy has a smaller heat capacity and 
greater sensitivity to the temperature variation than 
conventional temperature-sensitive elements, such as a 
thermo-wax. The known combination faucet presses one end of the 
movable valve disc with a coil-formed shape memory alloy 
coil and the other end of the disc with a coil spring.  
 
The coil-formed shape memory alloy is arranged to be in 
direct contact with water mixture of hot water and cold 
water, and has a given coil length at a specific 
temperature. The coil-formed shape memory alloy works 
in the following manner in response to a variation in 
the temperature of water mixture. When the temperature of water mixture is stable at 
a preset temperature, the movable valve disc stops at a 
position of balance of the coil-formed shape memory 
alloy and the coil spring. When the temperature of 
water mixture is varied to the specific temperature due 
to some outside disturbance, the coil-formed shape 
memory alloy generates a shape restoring force to 
recover the given coil length set at the specific 
temperature. The shape restoring force destroys the 
balance of the coil-formed shape memory alloy and the 
coil spring and moves the movable valve disc towards the 
coil spring or the coil-formed shape memory alloy. When 
the coil-formed shape memory alloy is set to change the 
coil length successively in a temperature range around 
the preset temperature, the coil-formed shape memory 
alloy varies its coil length in response to a change of 
the temperature of water mixture in the vicinity of the 
preset temperature so as to generate

temperature, determining a gain of a feed-back control 
based on mixing conditions of hot water and cold water; 

and 
(c) feed-back controlling the pre-load of at least 
one of said first spring and said second spring based on 

said gain to compensate for said deviation. 
A method as claimed in claim 16, further 
comprising the steps of: 


(a) adjusting a pre-load of at least one of said 
first spring and said second spring to set said pre-load 

equal to an initial value corresponding to a target 
temperature of said water mixture; 
(b) detecting the temperature of said water mixture 
after said step (a); 
(c) when the temperature of said water mixture 
detected in said step (b) deviates from said target 

temperature, determining whether a feed-back control is 
to be executed or not based on a magnitude of said 

deviation; and 
(d) when execution of said feed-back control is 
determined in said step (c), controlling the pre-load of 

at least one of said first spring and said second spring 
to compensate for said deviation. 
A method as claimed in claim 16, further 
comprising the steps of: 


(a) storing a relationship between a target 
temperature of said water mixture and a pre-load; 
(b) adjusting a pre-load of at least one of said 
first spring and said second spring to set said pre-load 

equal to an initial value corresponding to a target 
temperature of said water mixture based on the 

relationship stored in said step (a); 
(c) detecting the temperature of said water mixture 
after said step (b); 
(d) when the temperature of said water mixture 
detected in said step (c) deviates from said target 

temperature, adjusting the pre-load of at least one of 
said first spring and said second spring to compensate 

for said deviation; and 
(e) updating the relationship stored in said step 
(a) with a new set of values of said target temperature 

and said pre-load when said deviation of the temperature 
 

of said water mixture detected by said temperature 
detection means from said target temperature fulfils a 

predetermined condition. 
A method as claimed in claim 16, further 
comprising the steps of: 


(a) storing a plurality of relations between a pre-load 
and a target temperature of said water mixture; 
(b) selecting one relation, based on inputs of 
predetermined data, among said plurality of relations 

between the pre-load and the target temperature stored 
in said step (a); and 
(c) adjusting the pre-load of at least one of said 
first spring and said second spring to set the pre-load 

equal to an initial value corresponding to a target 
temperature, based on said one relation selected in said 

step (b).
