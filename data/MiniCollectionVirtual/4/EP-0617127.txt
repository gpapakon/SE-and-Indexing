<ABSTRACT>
Unique antigenic epitopes of IgE (designated 
ige.bl
) which 
are present on IgE-bearing B lymphocytes but not basophils 

are described. One class of 
ige.bl
 epitopes are at or near 
the FcεR binding site on IgE. Another class of 
ige.bl
 
epitopes are associated with the extracellular segment of 

the domain of ε chains which anchor IgE to the B cell 
membrane (ε.mb/ec)).

<DESCRIPTION>
The immediate-type hypersensitivity, such as 
extrinsic asthma, hay fever, and allergic responses 
to certain food or drugs, is mediated primarily by 
immunoglobulin E (IgE). In an IgE-mediated allergic 
response, the allergen binds to IgE on the surface 
of mast cells and basophilic leukocytes (basophils). 
This binding causes a crosslinking of the IgE 
molecules and hence the underlying receptors for the 
Fc portion of IgE (FcεR) and thereby triggers the 
release of pharmacologic mediators such as histamine, 
slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis and 
serotonin. The release of these mast cell and 
basophil products causes the various pathological 
manifestations of allergy. Patients affected with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity 
reactions are often treated with histamine 
antagonists to alleviate symptoms. In 
addition, during hay fever seasons, desensitization 
procedures are used to prevent or to alleviate 
persistent, lasting allergic reactions. In these 
procedures, small doses of allergen are injected 
periodically to induce certain, not-fully-understood 
immune responses that somehow reduce the IgE-mediated 
responses. Densensitization procedures have 
been effective in certain patients and only marginally 
effective in others.  It has been suggested that IgE-mediated allergy 
might be treated by inhibiting the binding of IgE to 
mast cells and basophils. For example, synthetic 
peptides representing various regions of the Fc of 
IgE (Fcε)have been explored as competitive inhibitors 
for the binding of IgE to the receptors on 
mast cells and basophils. See e.g., Stanworth, 
D.R., Molec. Immun. 21:1183-1190 (1984); Stanworth, 
D.R. and Burt, D.S., Molec. Immun. 23:1231-1235 
(1986); Burt, D.S. et al., Molec. Immun. 24:379-389 
(1987); Hahn, U.S. Patent No. 4,683,292; Hamburger, 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,171,299 and 4,161,522. However, 
presumably due to the much lower affinity of these 
peptides compared with whole IgE for the FcεR, such 
peptides have not been proven highly efficacious for 
treatment of allergy. In recent years, monoclonal antibody methodologies 
have been employed to map the various 
antigen and functional epitopes on IgE. Baniyash 
and Eshhar (Eur. J. Immunol. 14:799-807 (1984)) 
reported that among the several rat monoclonal 
antibodies made against IgE, three inhibited the 
binding of mouse IgE to rat basophilic cells. Since 
the antibodies could also induce serotonin release 
from basophils bound with IgE, the antibodies 
probably bound sites on Fc, which were near but not 
in the
