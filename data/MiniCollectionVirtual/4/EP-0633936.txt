<ABSTRACT>
Certain isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) have been found to have activity against scarab pests. These isolates are designated B.t. PS86B1, B.t. PS43F and B.t. PS50C. These isolates, or transformed hosts containing the gene expressing a scarab-active toxin obtained from the isolates, can be used to control scarab-active pests, e.g., masked chafer, Cyclocephala sp., June bettle, Cotinis sp., northern masked chafer, Cyclocephala borealis, Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica, and Pasadena masked chafer, Cyclocephala pasadenae, in various environments.

 DESCRIPTIONPROCESS FOR CONTROLLING SCARAB PESTS WITH BACILLUS THURINGIWSIS ISOLATESCross-Reference to a Related Application This is a continuation-in-part of co-pending application Serial No. 07/828,430, filed January 30, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of co-pending application Serial No. 07/808,316, filed on December 16, 1991, now abandoned.Background of the InventionThe soil microbe Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium characterized by parasporal crystalline protein inclusions. These often appear microscopically as distinctively shaped crystals. The proteins can be highly toxic to pests and specific in their activity. Certain B.t. toxin genes have been isolated and sequenced, and recombinant DNA-based B.t. products produced and approved.In addition, with the use of genetic engineering techniques, new approaches for delivering B.t. endotoxins to agricultural environments are under development, including the use of plants genetically engineered with endotoxin genes for insect resistance and the use of stabilized intact microbial cells as B.t. endotoxin delivery vehicles (Gaertner, F.H., L. Kim [1988] TIBTECH 6.S4-S7). Thus, isolated B.t. endotoxin genes are becoming commercially valuable.Over the past 30 years, commercial use of B.t. pesticides has been largely restricted to a narrow range of lepidopteran (caterpillar) pests. Preparations of the spores and crystals of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki have been used for many years as commercial insecticides for lepidopteran pests. For example, B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-1 produces a crystal called a delta endotoxin which is toxic to the larvae of a number of lepidopteran insects.In recent years, however, investigators have discovered B.t. pesticides with specificities for a much broader range of pests. For example, other species of B.t., namely israelensis and san diego (a.k.a. B.t. tenebrionis, a.k.a. M-7), have been used commercially to control insects of the orders Diptera and Coleoptera, respectively
