<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for controlling the electric drive of a vehicle, in particular a rail vehicle, utilising to a large degree the adhesion between the wheel and rail or underlying surface. A control is carried out taking into account the gradient of the adhesion characteristic curve, the system operating with an equivalent variable which can be detected by technical measuring means, for the gradient and a set moment value which can be predetermined by the operator being limited in such a way that a driving/braking operation is achieved at a predetermined optimum operating point of the adhesion characteristic curve.

Method for the open-loop and closed-loop control 
of an electric drive of a vehicle, in particular of a 

rail vehicle, with a high degree of utilization of the 
frictional engagement between the wheel and rail or 

underlying surface, with limitation of a desired torque 
value (M
S
), prescribed by the driver of the vehicle, to a 
value which permits driving mode or braking mode near to 

the instantaneous maximum of frictional engagement 
between the drive wheel of the vehicle and the underlying 

surface, characterized in that 

a) the positive gradient of the respectively valid 
frictional engagement characteristic curve, that is 

to say of the coefficient of friction, being determined 
as a function of the slip speed (V
S
), 
b) the difference between the determined positive 
gradient of the frictional engagement characteristic 

curve and a prescribed desired positive gradient 
value being formed, 
c) the formed difference between the positive gradient 
values being converted into a reduction factor (r), 

and 
d) the desired torque value (M
S
) being limited to a 
desired input torque value (M
E
) by multiplying the 
reduction factor (r) by the prescribed desired 

torque value (M
S
), and the said desired input torque 
value (M
E
) being fed to the electric drive, and 
e) the positive gradient of the frictional engagement 
characteristic curve and the conversion of the 

difference between the positive gradient values into 
the reduction factor (r) taking place using an 

alternative variable which can be determined by 
measuring means and whose physical relationship with 

the positive gradient of the frictional engagement 
characteristic curve has previously been determined. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a phase shift signal (Φ) is used as alternative 

variable and is formed as follows:  
 


a) a preferably sinusoidal test signal (T) is superimposed 
on the desired input torque value (M
E
), 
b) the angular speed or the angular acceleration is 
measured at the mechanical output, preferably at the 

engine shaft of the electric drive; 
c) an output-side test signal (T
A
) contained in the 
measurement signal acquired in this way is filtered 

out of it; 
d) by comparing the input-side and output-side test 
signals (T, T
A
), its phase shift (Φi) is determined 
and is used as the actual value (Φi) of the alternative 

variable (Φ), and 
e) a test signal (T) is used whose one-to-one relationship 
between the phase shift (Φ) and positive gradient 

of the characteristic curve at the selected test 
signal frequency is known. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a closed-loop control device with 

integral behaviour, in particular a PI controller, is 
used to form the reduction signal (r). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a modified actual value (Φ
i,m
) of 
the alternative variable, which value (Φ
i,m
) is formed by 
differentiation of the actual value (Φ
i
) with subsequent 
single-ended limitation, is used to raise the desired 

value (Φ
S
) of the alternative variable (Φ).
