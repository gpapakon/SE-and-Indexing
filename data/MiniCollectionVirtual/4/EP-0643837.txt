<ABSTRACT>
The quantitative test device is manufactured by attaching the critical component of a two-component dye system to minute particles such as microcrystalline cellulose, silica, or latex, which particles are suspended in a solution of a polymeric binder. Additional non-immobilized components of the reaction system of the test device are optionally added to the polymer solution. The suspension of dyed particles in polymer solution is applied to a fabric as a coating, using conventional coating machines, to obtain a homogeneous distribution of immobilized dye throughout the fabric. The measurement zone is made from a film support made of a material having a lower melting point than the filter cloth fabric used in the measurement zone was used. By using a lower melting point material for the support film, impulse heat sealing is controlled to a degree such that the lower melting point support is made to melt and extrude through the mesh of the fabric on either side of the channel, forming a seal along the sides of the channel. The device may be manufactured using a feedback loop which allows one to modify continuously the dimensions of a reading scale printed on the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for
manufacturing a quantitative test device. More specifically, the
present invention is directed to a method for manufacturing a
device for quantitatively analyzing the constituents of whole
blood or other body fluids with self-contained, ready-to-use test
strips.Medical science has an increasing need for quick, accurate
determination of analytes in blood or other body fluids.
Traditionally, assays for analytes have been performed by
laboratories and required skilled technicians, complex apparatus
and reagents, and considerable time in order to obtain accurate
results. A great number of qualitative and some quantitative
devices and methods have been developed which eliminate or
decrease the need for laboratory diagnostic services. Many of
these devices and methods include test strips or dip sticks which
can be exposed to blood or another body fluid in order to obtain
a diagnostic result. A common example of this technology
includes the various test products for determining glucose
concentration for diabetics to monitor their glucose levels.Flow devices for quantitative analytical measurements are
currently available. However, their utility has been
significantly hampered by materials and processes for producing
the devices which are unsuitable for use with fully automated and
internally controlled manufacturing. The need for such
automation and process control is particularly important for the 
measurements involving the use of single or multiple calibration
standards prior to running the test sample in the final analysis.Among the problems encountered in manufacturing these flow
devices are the problems of trapping the indicator in such a
manner that a reliable, accurate determination can be made. A
number of prior art workers have described such assay devices,
but heretofore there has not been a method that can be automated
for making a reliable quantitative device.Previous methods for preparing flow devices for quantitative
measurements involve immobilizing an indicator dye on an
absorbant support, typically a special paper in roll or sheet
form, where the immobilization process involves chemical
reactions which are difficult to control, and washing steps. It
is very difficult to achieve uniform distribution of immobilized
dye molecules throughout the sheets or from beginning to end of
a roll of this paper. Additionally, the mechanical effects of
processing can degrade the physical integrity of a paper and
result in variable wicking and volume of fluid
