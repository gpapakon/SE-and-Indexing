<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device of the RESURF type with a "low-side" lateral 
DMOST (LDMOST), comprising a semiconductor body (1) of predominantly a first 

conductivity type and a surface region (3) adjoining a surface (2) and of a second 
conductivity type. The LDMOST comprises a back gate region (5) of the first 

conductivity type provided in the surface region (3) with a source region (6) of the 
second conductivity type in the back gate region (5) and a channel region (7) defined 

between the source region (6) and an edge of the back gate region (5). A drain region 
(8) of the second conductivity type is present at a distance from the back gate region 

(5). A separation region (15) of the first conductivity type is provided around the 
LDMOST in the surface region (3), which separation region adjoins the surface (2) and 

extends towards the semiconductor body (1). One or several breakdown voltage raising 
zones (9, 99) of the first conductivity type are provided between the drain region (8) 

and the back gate region (5) and between the drain region (8) and the separation region 
(15). The surface (2) is provided with an insulating layer (17) on which a conductor 

track (25) is provided which is connected to the drain region (8) and which extends over 
the voltage raising zones (99) and the separation region (15). According to the 

invention, at least one zone (9A or 5) of the following zones: a zone forming the back 
gate region (5) and a first breakdown voltage raising zone (9A) lying between the back 

gate (5) and the drain region (8) and closest to the back gate region (5), is provided 
with at least one portion (35) projecting towards the other zone, at the area of which the 

distance between the two zones is smaller than in an adjoining portion of these zones, 
while the first breakdown voltage raising zone (9A) has no connection to a breakdown 

voltage raising zone (99) over which the conductor track (25) extends. An exchange of 
charge between the back gate region (5) and the first breakdown voltage raising zone 

(9A) may take place through this projecting portion (35), whereby a faster switching of 
the semiconductor device is facilitated, while a leakage current between back 

gate/source region (6, 5) and semiconductor body (1) does not occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device of the RESURF type with
a low-side lateral DMOST (LDMOST), comprising a semiconductor body of
predominantly a first conductivity type and a surface region which adjoins a surface,
which is of a second conductivity type opposed to the first, and which forms a first p-n
junction with the semiconductor body at the side facing away from the surface, which
LDMOST comprises a back gate region in the form of a surface zone of the first
conductivity type provided in the surface region, with a source region in the form of a
surface zone of the second conductivity type in the back gate region, and a channel
region defined between the source region and an edge of the back gate region, and a
drain region in the form of a surface zone of the second conductivity type situated at a
distance from the back gate region, while a separation region of the first conductivity
type is provided in the surface region around the LDMOST so as to adjoin the surface
and extend towards the semiconductor body, and one or several breakdown voltage
raising zones of the first conductivity type are provided between the drain region and
the back gate region and between the drain region and the separation region, which
breakdown voltage raising zones adjoin the surface, this surface being provided with an
insulating layer on which a conductor track is provided which is connected to the drain
region and which extends over the voltage raising zones and the separation region.The LDMOST is intended for a so-called low-side application, i.e. during
operation the drain region may be at a comparatively high voltage relative to the
semiconductor body and the back gate/source region, while the back gate/source region
carries a comparatively low voltage relative to the semiconductor body. No breakdown
voltage raising zones are present then between the back gate region and the separation
region in practice.The article "A Versatile 700-1200-V IC Process for Analog and Switching
Applications" from "IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices, vol. 38, no. 7, July 1991, pp.
1582-1589) discloses a device of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph which is
particularly suitable as a switching element for high voltages. An n-channel LDMOST 
lies in the surface region in the known device. The surface region is formed by an n-type
epitaxial layer on a semiconductor body formed by a p-type semiconductor
substrate. A p-type back gate and n-type source and drain regions are provided in the
surface region. Gate oxide is
