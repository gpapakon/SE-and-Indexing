<DESCRIPTION>
 AUXILIARY STORAGE AND DISPENSER UNITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention pertains to medication or supply dispenser stations for dispensing pharmaceutical and other supply items from locked storage in a hospital, nursing home or other environment where control of supply items are of importance. More particularly, this invention pertains to an auxiliary unit for use with a medication or supply dispenser station for storing and dispensing larger items that are not amenable to storage in the conventional dispenser station.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTThe practice of dispensing pharmaceutical items one at a time from locked storage under strict accountability and security environment is well known. For instance, in many hospitals and nursing homes, medicines are now held under locked storage in medication dispenser stations, such as the one disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,014,875, where nursing personnel retrieve the medicine from locked storage for dispensing, simultaneously and automatically updating the patient's records and billing. While this prior art deals with small items such as syringes, vials and the like, larger hospital items are generally not amenable to storage therein and, in addition, have their own inimitable storage problems.Large items such as liter bottles of fluids, boxes of diapers, boxes of examination gloves, rolls of bandages, and catheter sets are often too large to be dispensed from the patented dispensing cabinet. Traditionally they are stacked on open shelving where dust and dirt accumulate to interfere with the cleanliness of their use. Where they are housed in a protective layer, they are often stored on 

 shelves over which other items are laid that have sharp corners or are of such a weight that the sterility seal is often broken thereby requiring the item to be discarded without use. Moreover, these items are often stored in dark cabinets where they are soon forgotten or stored in cabinets where they are pushed out of the way during a search for other items. The end result is costly, out-of- control inventory management which adds to the expense of operation. In addition, each hospital carries its own particular designation and stock number for dispensable items used therein. Quite often these hospital designations are different from the common name given to the item. Nursing and other technical personnel transferred from one hospital to another are frequently met with a confusing set of stock numbers and identifiers for particular

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An auxiliary storage and dispensing unit for use with a computer-controlled supply and medication dispenser station comprising: a) a cabinet having integrally connected top, bottom, side and rear cabinet panels defining a tall storage and interior dispensing cavity accessible through a front opening; b) a plurality of horizontally openable and closeable doors including door frames and transparent windows hingedly mounted and locked over said front opening; c) means for interconnecting one or more doors to allow access to a particular portion of said interior cavity; and, d) door unlocking means interconnected the computer-controlled station for selectively unlocking one or more of said doors at a particular location on said cabinet as a function of information inputted to said station.
2. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 1 where said plurality of doors is arranged to open from one side of said cabinet.
3. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 2 including means to reverse the doors to open from the opposite side of said cabinet. 


 4. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 1 further including partitions to divide said cavity into vertically smaller sub-cavities for storage and dispensing smaller items therefrom.
5. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 4 further including an upwardly turned front lip formed on said partitions to aid in retaining the items stored thereon.
6. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 4 further including a downwardly turned front lip formed on said partitions to aid in retaining the items stored thereon.
7. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 1 wherein said partitions include an upwardly turned front lip and a downwardly turned rear lip spaced-apart therefrom so that by rotating said partition 180Â° said downwardly turned rear lip may be relocated to the front of said partition.
8. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 4 further including moveable racks mountable on the underside of said partitions for hanging dispensable items therefrom. 


 9. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 1 further including moveable racks mountable on the underside of said top cabinet panel for hanging dispensable items therefrom.
10. The auxiliary storage and dispensing unit of Claim 1 further including spaced-apart pairs of slide fittings interposed said partitions and said partitions wherein each said fitting comprises: a) a fitting body; b) a pair of spaced-apart first and second legs extending therefrom for insertion in a pair of slots formed in each said cabinet side panel; c) said first leg having an upwardly turned portion adapted to bear against the inside of said cabinet side panel after insertion into said slot; d) said second leg having a beveled surface formed thereon to assist in mounting said fitting in said slots; e) a partition carrying groove formed in said body opposite said legs for supporting said partition in sliding arrangement thereacross; and, f) an inwardly directed wall segment of said groove formed above the lower half thereof, for bearing against an upper surface of said partition to prevent said partition from tilting downward during withdrawal from said cabinet to expose items stored thereon.
