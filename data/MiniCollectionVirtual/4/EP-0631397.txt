<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides channel allocation method
which achieves a high frequency utilization efficiency

while suppressing the average transmission power by
transmission power control. Selection priority degrees

and initial minimum transmission power control amounts
are set for all radio channels allocated to the system.

The initial minimum transmission power control amounts
are set such that the radio channel having higher

selection priority degree has higher or at least equal
initial minimum transmission power control amount than

the lower selection priority radio channel. Upon
channel allocation, a radio channel is selected in

accordance with the selection priority degree, by the
way that calculating the transmission power control

amount of the radio channel (S505 to S507), comparing
the transmission power control amount with the initial

minimum transmission power control amount (S508), and
when the transmission power control amount is equal to

or higher than the initial minimum transmission power
control amount, then use of the radio channel is permitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dynamic channel allocation
method in a cellular mobile telephone system.In a radiocommunications system of large capacity
such as a mobile telephone system, the service area is
covered by a plurality of base stations and channels
with the same frequency are used by the base stations
among which no interference disturbance occurs in order
to achieve effective use of frequencies. The mobile
telephone system just described is called a cellular
system.Allocation of channels to be used by base stations
is roughly divided into two methods. According to one
of the methods, channels to be used by each base station
are allocated fixedly in advance so that no interference
disturbance may occur as a result of predicting
the propagation characteristics. This method is called
fixed channel allocation and is adopted in present-day 
mobile telephone system. The other method is called
dynamic channel allocation in which a channel which
does not cause interference disturbance is selectively
used for each communication. While this method requires
a complicated apparatus construction, since it
allows free use of any channel so long as it does not
cause interference disturbance, it is advantageous in
that the number of subscribers which can be accommodated
is greater than that of the fixed channel allocation.
Accordingly, adopting the dynamic channel allocation
for a mobile telephone system is undergoing re
search.For the dynamic channel allocation method, an
autonomous reuse partitioning (hereinafter referred to
simply as ARP) method to realize channel allocation
with a highly efficient utility of frequency and very
simple control has been proposed as disclosed, for
example, in a paper published under the title of Autonomous
Reuse Partitioning in Cellular Systems, Proceedings
of IEEE Vehicular Technology Society, 42th VTS
Conference, pp. 782 - 785, May, 1992.In the ARP system, channels are selected in accordance
with the same of channel number order at all
cells, and put into use from a channel which presents a
carrier-to-interference ratio (hereinafter referred to
as CIR) higher than the required value in both 
reverse-link (mobile station to base station) and
forward-link (base station to mobile station).Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustrating control of a
base station to which the conventional ARP system is
applied.If it is assumed that n channels numbered 1 to n
are available at each base station, and that each
base station periodically receives and stores interference
wave levels Uup(i) of
