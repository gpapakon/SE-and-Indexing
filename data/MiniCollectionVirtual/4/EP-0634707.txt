<ABSTRACT>
A developing apparatus usable with an image 
forming apparatus includes a frame having developing 

device; a toner accommodation container (12a) having an 
opening for supplying toner to the developing device 

and for accommodating the toner; and an elastic sheet (12a1) 
inserted between the frame and the toner accommodation 

container to seal the opening, wherein the elastic 

sheet (12a1) has a thickness larger than the gap when it is 
not compressed, and has a flexible sheet projected out 

of the gap. A method of sealing an opening of the 
toner accommodation container (12a), includes detachably 

mounting an elastic sheet (12a1) to a longitudinal end of an 
insertion member; then inserting the insertion member 

between the toner accommodation container (12a) and the 
frame (12b) to a position for sealing the opening by the 

elastic sheet (12a1); and then removing the elastic sheet 
from the insertion member. A sealing member for 

sealing an opening of a toner accommodating container 
includes a flexible film; and an elastic sheet on the 

flexible film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealing member, a sealing member mounting method, a developing apparatus, a process cartridge, a process cartridge remanufacturing method and an image forming apparatus.Electrophotographic type image forming machines are widely used as in copying machines or the like. In such an apparatus, a surface of an electrophotographic photosensitive drum which is rotated is uniformly charged, and a selective image exposure thereof is effected to form a latent image thereon. The latent image is visualized with toner and the toner image is transferred onto a recording material. In some of such apparatuses, a photosensitive drum and a developing device having a developer container or the like are unified into a cartridge, which is detachably mountable to an image forming apparatus. The latent image formed on the photosensitive drum is developed with developer contained in the developer container in the cartridge.In order to prevent leakage of developer from the developer container during transportation of the process cartridge, an opening of the developer container with sealed by a sealing member. Prior to the start of use, the user removes the sealing member to open the opening of the container, by which the developer in the container is permitted to be supplied to the developing roller or the like through the opening of the container.Document US 5 080 745 discloses a seal having a cover structure which forms a toner bin slot (46) with the toner container, comprises a sealing sheet (22) adapted to be inserted through the slot to cover the container opening and having an adhesive coating on portion of the sheet (22) facing the container sealing surface (40) about the opening (36). The adhesive coating is covered by a protecting sheet (26) connected at its foremost edge to an adhesive exposing member (28) and the sealing sheet (22) is connected at its foremost edge to a seal removal member (30). The adhesive exposing member (28) and the seal removal member (30) are each of length to project out of the slot (46) when the seal is in sealing position through the slot.Document US 4 930 684 discloses a toner container having a closure strip which comprises a resilient seal attached to one face of the closure strip for making the closure strip fit snugly between the bottom walls of the channels and snugly between the container lip wall and the hopper lip wall of each channel.The present invention provides a further improvement in such an apparatus.Accordingly, a first aspect of the
