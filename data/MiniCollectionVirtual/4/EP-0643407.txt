<ABSTRACT>
An electronic apparatus having a switching mechanism comprises a first side pattern 
(1a) and a second side pattern (1b), formed on a substrate (1). An external operating 

member (3) is disposed at the side of the electronic apparatus. A conducting member 
(2a) and an insulating member (2b) are provided between the side patterns (1a) and (1b) 

and the external operating member (3), the former on the side of the side patterns (la) 
and (lb) and the latter on the side of the external operating member (3), so as to obtain a 

unified elastic member (2). 
The conducting member (2a) connects the first side pattern (1a) and the second 
side pattern (1b), when the external operating member is pushed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic apparatus and manufacturing
method thereof. In particular, it relates to an electronic apparatus having a switching
mechanism for switching with an elastic member and to a manufacturing method of an
electronic apparatus having a switching mechanism.As shown in Figure 8 of the accompanying drawings, in the prior art, an external
operating member 13 is retained by a case 14 and incorporated into the same so as to be
pushed and sprung back after its release. When the external operating member 13 is
pushed, the tip thereof presses a conductive elastic member 12, so as to conduct to a
pattern 11a of a substrate 11.When pressure applied to the external operating member 13 is removed, the
conductive elastic member 12 returns to the original position because of spring pressure
of a coil spring 17.It is known that the pattern 11a of the substrate 11 is electrically conducted to the
conductive elastic member 12 and supports the same, as can be seen in the utility patent
laid open publication JP-U-B-53-62675 (1978).Figures 9 and 10 of the accompanying drawings show a known electronic
timepiece 25, in which an external operating member 23, a conductive elastic member
22, and substrate patterns 21a and 21b are all disposed with a display element 24.In the switching mechanism shown in Figure 8, the external operating member 13
is pushed and static electricity is generated. The static electricity flows from a pattern on
a substrate to an IC 18 through the conductive elastic member 12, which brings a
problem of malfunction of the IC 18.In an electronic apparatus in which a switch is disposed at the front of the
electronic apparatus as shown in Figures 9 and 10, the area for the display element is 
reduced because the switch is provided at the front of the electronic apparatus.
Consequently, it is hard to read each piece of information displayed.A further known switching mechanism is shown in European Patent
Publication No. 0423924, forming the base of the preamble of claim 1, which describes a push button switch in which two circuit
patterns are formed on the surface of a substrate. A push button pushes a resilient
insulator towards the surface of the substrate to bring a conductive element attached
to the resilient insulator into contact with the circuit patterns to close the switch.It is an object of the present invention to prevent the static electricity generated
outside of the electronic apparatus from flowing into an IC.It is another object of the present invention
