<ABSTRACT>
Dibenzo[b,d]pyrans are prepared by heating a dihydroxybenzoic acid derivative in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst and an inert non-polar solvent in which the dihydroxybenzoic acid is soluble but in which the Lewis acid catalyst is insoluble or very slightly soluble. A typical embodiment involves the preparation of intermediates useful in the synthesis of dronabinol and related dibenzo[b,d]
pyrans.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an improved process 
for the preparation of dibenzo[b,d]pyrans and in particular 
for the preparation of (6aR,10aR)-3-alkyl-4-carboalkoxy-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ols, 
valuable intermediates for the production of dronabinol 
and related compounds. Dronabinol is the United States Adopted name for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) : 
Dronabinol recently was included in the United States 
Pharmacopoeia and currently is in use as an antiemetic for 
persons undergoing chemotherapy. Other therapeutic applications, 
including its use as an appetite stimulant in cachectic 
conditions, also are under investigation. Previous processes for the preparation of dronabinol 
and related compounds have employed acid-catalyzed electrophilic 
condensation of a 5-alkylresorcinol such as 5-n-pentylresorcinol 
(commonly known as olivetol) and a menthadienol, 
followed by cyclization; See, e.g., Petrzilka et 
al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 52, 1102 (1969).  
 Often the condensation and cyclization are carried out 
sequentially, without isolation or purification of the 
intermediate cannabidiols, but this approach suffers from 
the production of water in the condensation step. This in 
turn leads to side-reactions during the subsequent cyclization; 
e.g., isomerization of the double bond from the Δ9-position 
to the thermodynamically more stable but unwanted 
Δ8-position. Thus the condensation/cyclization conditions 
employed by Petrzilka et al., supra, cause complete double-bond 
isomerization, necessitating two additional chemical 
steps to restore the double bond to the Δ9-position. The 
overall yield of dronabinol having a purity greater than 96% 
thus was reported to be only 17-22% and at least two very 
tedious and careful chromatographic separations were 
required. See Razdan et al., JACS,96, 5860 n.6(b) (1974). Attempts have been made to absorb the water formed during 
the condensation step by using various drying agents 
(anhydrous magnesium sulfate, molecular sieves) Razdan et 
al., supra, U.S. Patent No. 4,025,516 and U.S. Patent No. 
4,116,979]. Although on a small scale a 31% yield of reasonably 
pure dronabinol can be isolated using these techniques, 
the products are formed as a complex mixture. Moreover 
when carried out on larger scale, the product mixture 
still includes significant amounts of Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol. 
See e.g., Olsen et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,381,399. Stoss et al., Synlett, 1991, 553, describe a synthesis 
of dronabinol in which
