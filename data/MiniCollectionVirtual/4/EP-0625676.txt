<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for roasting, baking and cooking food and apparatus for carrying out the method for household appliances equipped with baking ovens, the household appliances being equipped with thermal heating elements and, optionally in combination therewith, microwave heating elements, which [lacuna] a control (1) selectable according to the particular food to be cooked, preset a time-temperature profile with corresponding baking-oven temperature control hysteresis in dependence on a predetermined baking-oven operating mode, the type of food to be cooked, weight of food to be cooked and desired result to be achieved with the food to be cooked, the cooking, roasting or baking process being monitored by at least one temperature sensor (6) and preferably proceeding fully automatically.

Cooking, roasting and baking method for domestic appliances which are equipped
with baking ovens and which are provided with thermal heating elements and optionally

also in combination therewith with microwave heating elements, wherein a
time/temperature profile is preset by a control (1), which is selectable specific to stock to

be cooked, in dependence on preset parameters such as a predetermined mode of baking

oven operation, a type of stock to be cooked, a weight of stock to be cooked or a desired
treatment result of stock to be cooked, and the preferably fully-automatically elapsing and

temperature-regulated cooking, roasting and baking process is monitored by at least one
temperature sensor (6), characterised in that a variable baking oven temperature

regulating hysteresis is determined in accordance with read-out preset values by the
control (1) in dependence on the preset parameters and underlies the temperature

regulation.
Cooking, roasting and baking method according to claim 1, characterised in that for
low-temperature cooking methods a baking oven temperature regulating hysteresis of

about plus or minus 3° Kelvin is presettable by the sensor-supplied control (1), wherein
low-temperature cooking methods are, for example, the drying of herbs and tea, the

growing of yoghurt cultures and the raising of yeast.
Cooking, roasting and baking method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the sensor-supplied control (1) sets a baking oven temperature regulating hysteresis of

about plus or minus 3° Kelvin for the grilling of poultry and the thawing of frozen products
with high fat content.
Cooking, roasting and baking method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the sensor-supplied control (1) sets a baking oven temperature regulating hysteresis of

about plus or minus 15° Kelvin for the baking of flat-baked wares and small bakery
products.
Cooking, roasting and baking method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the sensor-supplied control (1) sets a baking oven temperature regulating hysteresis of

about plus or minus 30° Kelvin for the grilling of pork, mutton and gratins. 
Cooking, roasting and baking method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the sensor-supplied control (1) sets a baking oven temperature regulating hysteresis of

about plus or minus 10° Kelvin for normal-weight preparation above a treatment
temperature of 100°C.
Cooking, roasting and baking method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the sensor-supplied control (1) sets a baking oven temperature regulating hysteresis of

about 15° Kelvin for the thawing of normal frozen products with low fat content.
Baking oven which is provided with thermal heating elements and optionally also in
combination therewith with microwave heating elements, with a control (1) which in

dependence on preset parameters, such as a predetermined mode of baking oven
operation, a type of stock to be cooked, a weight of stock to be cooked or a desired

treatment result of stock to be cooked, sets a time/temperature profile for a cooking,
roasting or baking process and undertakes the corresponding temperature regulation in

conjunction with a temperature sensor (6), characterised in that the control (1) variably
selects the baking oven temperature regulating hysteresis in dependence on the preset

parameters for the temperature regulation in accordance with read-out preset values.
