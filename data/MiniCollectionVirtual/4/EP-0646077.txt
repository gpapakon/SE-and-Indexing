<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns circuitry designed to recognize a short-circuit (or a line break) in an inductive circuit (1) connected via a high-resistance filter circuit (3) to a signal-processing circuit (2). The circuitry includes a monitoring circuit (4, 4') which is designed as part of or as an additional element to the signal-processing circuit (2) and which, when the ignition is switched on, initiates a test cycle designed to determine the inductance of the circuit (1) being monitored.

A circuit for monitoring an inductive circuit which is formed 
as part of a signal-processing circuit (2) or as an additional 

element (4, 4') of this circuit and is connected to the 
signal-processing circuit (2) by way of a high-ohmic input 

circuit or filter circuit (3), and which monitoring circuit 
initiates a test cycle to determine the inductance of the 

circuit (1) to be monitored, including the filter circuit (3), 
if predetermined conditions apply and/or in predetermined 

intervals,
characterized
 in that, at the beginning of the 
test cycle, one of the two outputs (D) of the filter circuit 

(3) is connected to ground (GND), while the second output (C) 
is connected to a voltage source (V
cc
) for a predetermined 
period of time, and in that the inductance is determined from 

the potential variation at an output (C) of the filter circuit 
(3). 
A circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the predetermined period 
of time corresponds at least to the transient time of the 

inductive circuit (1) to be monitored, including the filter 
circuit (3), and in that, upon lapse of the predetermined time 

period and disconnection of the voltage source (V
cc
), the 
potential variation at the second output (C) is evaluated to 

determine the inductance. 
A circuit as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that the filter circuit is 
arranged symmetrically and has each one high-ohmic series  

 
resistor (R1, R2) in the lines leading from the inductive 

circuit (1) to the signal-processing circuit (2), one 
capacitor (C1) interconnecting both outputs (C, D) of the 

filter circuit (3), and each one input capacitor (C2, C3) 
which connects an input (A, B) of the filter circuit (3) to 

ground. 
A circuit as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that a d.c. voltage potential 
is set for the filter circuit (3) by means of a voltage 

divider (R3, R4) which is connected to a source of d.c. 
voltage (V
cc
) on one side and to ground on the other side. 
A circuit as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4,
characterized
 in that a circuit (transistor 7, 
signal CC) is provided, by means of which the capacitor (C1), 

interconnecting both outputs (C, D) of the filter circuit, is 
discharged immediately on disconnection of the voltage source 

(V
cc
) by grounding the second output (C) of the filter circuit 
(3) for a short interval (dt
3
).
