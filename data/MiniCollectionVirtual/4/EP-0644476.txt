<ABSTRACT>
A predetermined relationship is established with 
respect to an arbitrary shape of a pattern, or a 

character, which is inputted by employing a pen on an 
input table, and displayed on a display unit in a 

handwriting input display apparatus. Further, a gesture 
is handwritten on the input tablet with the pen, so that a 

preselected process operation is carried out for the shape 
previously represented on the display unit, and therefore 

the display condition thereof may be changed. The line 
segment under representation is quickly and readily 

changed into an arbitrary condition. When a gesture is 
entered with respect to a plurality of line segments, 

these line segments are rearranged in response to a 
command corresponding to this gesture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a handwriting
input display method suitable for, e.g., an electronic
notebook apparatus and a portable computer.Very recently, a CAD system has grown, and then
an arbitrary pattern, or figure may be relatively simply
input. In this CAD system, when a pattern having an
arbitrary shape is drawn by using, for example, a mouse or
a pen, a pattern corresponding to this input pattern is
displayed on a monitor. Then, for example, after a
plurality of line segments have been entered, the
preselected parameters are designated in order to change
the display conditions of these line segments.For instance, when a plurality of line segments
elongated along the vertical direction are displayed in
such a manner that the upper ends thereof are aligned
along the horizontal direction, the below-mentioned
parameters are entered:
(1) A designation is made of a line segment of
interest.(2) A designation is made of reference points
for the respective line segments of interest.(3) A straight line such that the reference
points for the respective line segments of interest should
be aligned is entered. (4) A designation is made as to whether or not
an interval between the reference points is adjusted.(5) A designation is made of the positions of
the reference points at both ends after alignment.(6) A designation is made of a method for
transporting a line segment of interest (for example, a
designation is made as to whether the line segment is
transported along the y-axis direction, or along the
direction of the line segment).Otherwise, a predetermined mode is selected by
way of the menu operation, and the process operations for
the respective line segments are wholly designated.However, the above-described parameter
designating method owns such problems that the lengthy
operating procedure is required and lengthy process time
is needed. There is another problem that since the
parameter designation is carried out by entering the
numeral values, this parameter designation cannot be
intuitively performed, resulting in poor operability.Furthermore, the menu operation method owns the
following drawbacks:
(1) It is difficult to designate an arbitrary
point and an arbitrary direction at high speed.(2) It is difficult to simply utilize the
featured amounts of the established line segments (for
example, an arbitrary point on a line segment of interest,
a direction, or a length of a line segment of interest). (3) When the numeral value is entered to designate the featured amount, it
is difficult to

<CLAIMS>
A handwriting input display apparatus comprising:

display means (13) for displaying either a line segment or a character,
corresponding to a calculation result of a computer (1);
tablet means (15) for outputting coordinate data in response to an operation;
operation means for operating said tablet means;
at least one input handwriting storing means (51) for storing coordinate data
of input handwriting from said tablet means (15) in response to the operation of said

operation means;
means (53) for detecting a featured amount from the handwriting stored in
said input handwriting storing means;
means (56) for comparing said featured amount with a featured amount of a
gesture stored in a previously employed gesture data base; (72, 57, 58) and
means for specifying the operation of said operating means as a gesture when
said featured amount from the handwriting is similar to the featured amount of said

gesture at a level more than a predetermined level, thereby executing the
corresponding gesture; wherein:

   when either a line segment, or a character, is being displayed on said display,
(13) and said featured amount from the handwriting is input in such a manner that a

relationship is established with said line segment, or said character, a preselected
command is performed to change the display condition of said line segment, or said

character, by means of said operating means and in response to said execution by
means for specifying of said corresponding gesture; said apparatus being

characterised in that under such a condition that a plurality of line segments and/or
characters are displayed on said display (13), when said operation corresponds to an

operation so as to establish a predetermined relationship with said line segments or
characters, the relative display position of said line segments or characters is changed

and in that at least a portion of said tablet means is transparent, and formed on said
display means.
A handwriting input display apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein
under such a condition that a plurality of line segments and/or characters are 

displayed on said display (13), when said operation corresponds to such an operation
for bridging at least three line segments, said command is such a command for

rearranging at least said three line segments at an equidistant interval for
representation.
A handwriting input display apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
