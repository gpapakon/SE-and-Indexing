<ABSTRACT>
Both cellular mobile radio systems for full duplex communication between subscribers of the mobile radio system and network subscribers connected to the mobile radio system, and trunked radio systems are known in which subscriber groups can in each case exchange information with one another in half-duplex traffic. It is the object of the invention to specify a mobile radio system which exhibits greater flexibility and better frequency economy. By using switching means which switch an uplink radio channel to a downlink radio channel, subscriber groups with half duplex traffic can be formed in each full duplex mobile radio system, only one radio channel being needed for each subscriber group.

<CLAIMS>
Mobile radio arrangement with base stations and
mobile stations for communication between mobile

stations and/or between mobile stations and wire-based
subscribers, in which a large number of

uplink radio channels are associated with one
another in pairs as duplex radio channels in the

direction from the mobile station to the base
station, and a large number of downlink radio

channels are associated with one another in pairs
as duplex radio channels in the direction from the

base station to the mobile station, and in which
signalling from the base station and the mobile

station is provided on at least one monitoring
channel relating to the use of a duplex radio

channel and/or to a change to a bundled radio
system, with so-called group calls being possible

in the bundled radio system, in which only one
active subscriber can speak to one user group,

while all the other passive subscribers in the
user group can only listen to this active

subscriber,
characterized

in that
 coupling means are provided for coupling
an uplink radio channel or a wire-based subscriber

to at least one downlink radio channel, in order
to form a duplex radio channel for the active

subscriber during operation as a bundle radio
system, in which the individual users can access a 

radio channel using the half-duplex method, while
downlink radio channels are connected for the

passive subscribers in the half-duplex mode, with
one channel of the base station being used as a

group channel, while normal traffic can be handled
on the other channels for this base station.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the couplings are arranged in at least one
base station in the mobile radio arrangement.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the coupling means are arranged as a
conference circuit in at least one switching

arrangement in the mobile radio arrangement.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, for connection
to a message transmission system, 
characterized in
that
 the system contains at least one coupling
means, which are able, at least at times, to send

back data arriving from the message transmission
system to the message transmission system.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,

characterized in that
 a signalling channel, which
is associated exclusively with the respective

mobile station, is provided using the duplex
method in the mobile radio arrangement for each

mobile station which is involved with a group
call.
Arrangement according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 these signalling channels have a time-division
multiplex structure.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 means are provided in the mobile station
which determine the information which is required

for coordinated transmission on the duplex channel 
for the active subscriber from the mobile station,


in that
 means are provided in the mobile station
for transmission of shortened access messages, 
in
that
 means are provided in the base station for

analysis and processing of these messages based on
their arrival time or content, and 
in that
 a
control unit is provided in the radio network in

order to transmit to the mobile station a message
which contains at least the information that is

required for transmission.
Arrangement according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 means are provided in the mobile station
which determine the information which is required

for coordinated transmission on the group channel
from the mobile station, by communication with the

radio network on the signalling channel which is
allocated to it.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the mobile station has means for checking
whether the group channel is free and has means

for transmission of shortened access means, in
order, in this situation, where the aim is to

transmit information on the group channel, to
cause the respective mobile station to wait for

the free group channel and then to transmit
shortened access messages, and to cause it to wait

for reception of an acknowledgement, in order to
use this to determine the access authorization to

the group channel, the transmission time or the
transmission power.
Arrangement according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 a common group channel is allocated to the
signalling channel for the active mobile station,


in that
 means are provided for transmission of an
access message, which means can be activated when

the mobile station wishes to transmit information 
on the common group channel, a control unit is

designed to coordinate messages from different
mobile stations in the radio network, and to grant

access authorization to the common group channel
by means of acknowledgements.
Arrangement according to Claim 8, 
characterized in
that
 means are provided in the mobile station in
order to wait for a certain time, which can be

calculated, for the required acknowledgement from
the radio network once the mobile station has

signalled to the mobile network that it wishes to
have access to the group channel, and 
in that

means are provided in the mobile station for
subsequently repeating the access request when

there is no reaction from the radio network.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 11,

characterized in that
 means are provided in the
mobile station in order to release the group

channel without signalling after transmission of
the information to be transmitted on the group

channel.
Arrangement with mobile radio cells according to
one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that
 two
or more group channels are coupled to one another

in the same cell or in different cells.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 13, in
which the individual subscribers complete a normal

call setting-up procedure with a control unit in
the radio network, 
characterized in that
 the
control unit has means for allocating the

subscribers to the group call to the desired group
channel.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 14,

characterized in that
 means are provided for 
scrambling the communication during the normal

call setting-up procedure using the key of the
individual active subscriber, and then for

allocating the key for the group call to the
active subscriber.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 15,

characterized in that
 the mobile radio arrangement
has means in order to transmit information via

channels for group calls.
Arrangement according to Claim 16, 
characterized
in that
 means are provided which result in the
mobile stations being allocated to a cell or to a

group channel on the basis of the information
about group calls transmitted from the mobile

radio arrangement.
Arrangement according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the permanent signalling channel which is
allocated to a mobile station is intended for

subscriber monitoring or for safety-relevant
services during the group call.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the duplex radio
channels which are provided are based on the ETSI-GSM-Standard.
