<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an AC thin film 
electroluminescent device (hereinafter referred to as an ACTFEL 
device) and particularly, though not exclusively, to an ACTFEL 
device in which only the laterally emitted light is utilised, 
known as a LETFEL device, intended for use in an 
electrophotographic (laser) printer. It is known from US Patent Number 4535341 (Kun et al, Assignee 
Westinghouse Electric Corporation) to provide a thin film 
electroluminescent (TFEL) edge emitter comprising a common 
electrode layer, first and second dielectric layers with a 
phosphor layer disposed therebetween and an excitation 
electrode layer, the whole being disposed on a substrate layer. It has also been proposed (see US Patent Number 5043631 to Kun 
et al, Assignee Westinghouse Electric Corporation) to combine 
such a light source with integrated circuits formed in the 
substrate layer, wherein the integrated circuits control the 
illumination of the individual pixels of the TFEL structure, 
for use in, for example, light activated printer. It is the aim of the present invention to provide an improved 
ACTFEL device which has increased luminous efficiency compared 
to prior art devices. According to the present invention there is provided a thin 
film electroluminescent device comprising a first electrode 
layer, first and second dielectric layers with an active 
phosphor layer disposed therebetween, and a second electrode 
layer, wherein there is provided within the phosphor layer at 
least one barrier layer comprising a thin layer of insulating 
material having a dielectric constant greater than that of the 
phosphor layer.  
 There may be a single barrier layer, or alternatively at least 
two barrier layers are provided within the phosphor layer. Conveniently, the phosphor layer comprises ZnS:Mn and the 
dielectric layers (including the barrier layer(s) are selected 
from a choice of ZnSe, SiN, Al2O3, Y2O3 or Barium Titanate, of 
combinations of these, the most preferred materials being Y2O3 
and insulators whose dielectric constants are greater than that 
of the phosphor layer. Preferably, the or each barrier layer is a minimum of 100Å 
thick and not greater than 500Å thick, whilst the overall 
thickness of the phosphor layer (measured from the first 
dielectric layer to the second dielectric layer) is not less 
than 2000Å. Preferably, where there are two barrier layers 
these are placed equidistantly from each other and at equal 
distance from the closest dielectric layer. Conveniently, the device is
