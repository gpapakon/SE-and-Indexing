<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to crushers wherein the material is crushed between a cone (10) and a bottomless frustroconical body (18) surrounding the cone and wherein the body is mounted on a frame (20) movable with respect to the structure and provided with means (24) capable of transmitting circular, substantially horizontal oscillations or vibrations to the body. In order to control operation of the crusher and to provide for improved monitoring of its operating status, while increasing the useful life of the working surfaces, the cone (10) is mounted on its support (16) in such a way as to rotate freely and is provided with means (28) for measuring the rotation speed thereof about its axis of connection with means (32) of adjustment of the frequency and/or amplitude of the vibrations or oscillations of the body.

Grinder comprising a frame (16), a bottomless vessel (18) supported
by a mobile frame (20) in relation to the frame, a cone (10) placed inside the

vessel and means (24) suitable for communicating circular and approximately
horizontal vibrations or oscillations to the vessel, characterised in that the

cone (10) is mounted on the frame (16) in such a way as to be able to rotate
freely about its axis (12) and is equipped with means (28) for measuring the

speed of rotation of the cone about its axis, in association with means (32) for
adjusting the frequency and/or the amplitude of the vibrations or oscillations of

the vessel.
Grinder according to claim 1, characterised in that the movements of
the vessel (18) are generated by vibrators (24) mounted on the said frame

(20).
Grinder according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that it is equipped
with a system (26) for adjusting the position of the cone in terms of height in

relation to the vessel.
Process for adjusting a grinder according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
consisting in measuring the speed of rotation of the cone (10) about its axis

(12), in determining the minimum thickness of the layer of materials in the
output plane (34) of the ground materials from the measured value of the

speed of rotation of the cone and the width of the annular slit existing in the
said plane between the cone and the vessel (18) when the grinder is idle, and

in adjusting the frequency and/or the amplitude of the vibrations or oscillations
of the vessel to maintain the minimum thickness of the layer of materials at a

set point.
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that the position of the
cone (10) in terms of height in relation to the vessel (18) is adjusted to

maintain the minimum thickness of the layer of materials at the set point.
Process according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the wear of
the active surfaces of the vessel (18) and of the cone (10) is determined from

the variations in the speed of rotation of the cone about its axis for given 
settings of the frequency and amplitude of the vibrations or oscillations and of

the width of the output slit.
