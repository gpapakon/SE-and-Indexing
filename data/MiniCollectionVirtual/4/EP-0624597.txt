<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to HCV peptides and to
HCV derived chimeric peptides, comprising the dominant
epitopes of non-structural proteins coded by NS4b and
NS5a HCV genes, a process to obtain such peptides and
uses thereof in developing immunodiagnostic kits.HCV is known as being the main agent of non-A
non-B hepatitis (1). The HCV genome consists of a RNA
positive helix of 9,400 nucleotides appr., which
codifies three structural proteins, namely: the core
(C), two envelopes (env1 and env2) and six non-structural
proteins (NS), i.e. NS2, NS3, NS4a, NS4b,
NS5a and NS5b. Such RNA regions comprise non coding
fragments both at 5'- and at 3'- terminus, thus showing
a similar organisation as detected in Flavivirus and
Pestivirus (2).In order to prepare diagnostic kits to detect
HCV infections, virus coding sequences both of
structural and of non structural regions were expressed
in E. coli, yeast and Baculovirus (3). The resulting
proteins were used both as single protein or as
combination thereof, to develop immunological kits that
are able to capture anti-HCV anti antibodies from
samples.Data known in the art from these assays show
that HCV is the main responsible agent for the post-transfusional
sporadic hepatitis, and that the use of
said proteins is very advantageous in analyzing blood
samples from donors (6,7). However, with assays known
in the art and available on the market, some samples
escape from the screening and give false negative
results. Serological studies either on chimpanzees or on
post-transfusion HCV infected patients showed that the
most important epitopes reside into the nucleocapside
protein, consisting of NS3 and NS4b products
(8,9,11,12).Recently it was reported (13) that also the
gene for the NS5a product codifies a product able to
efficiently capture anti-HCV antibodies. The authors
expressed a recombinant protein in E. coli named (C)-NS3,
that is able to bind both to anti-C and to anti-NS3
antibodies (13). The chimeric protein is suitable
to develop a sensitive assay to detect anti-HCV
antibodies.Following a number of studies of serum
conversion, in order to make available a proper test
for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies in the blood
from donors, the diagnostic kit must also contain the
NS4b gene product, preferably the antigenic
determinants thereof. This is confirmed through assays
based on a NS4b derived polypeptide, known as c100-3,
which, however, did not show satisfactory specificity
and sensitivity.It was recently found (7) that 90% appr. of the
HCV induced hepatitis
