<ABSTRACT>
A connecting piece (1) for joining a metallic fitting to a plastic pipe for fluid media exhibits a part which can be screw-connected to the fitting and consists of a plastic which is considerably stronger than the part which can be welded to the pipe. Said plastic consists of a special polymer. In order to avoid damage, despite the pronounced torque which may occur upon screwing and unscrewing the fitting, the connecting piece (1) consists, per se, of the stronger plastic and is provided with a sleeve (3; 3a) consisting of the lesser-strength material only for the weld connection to the pipe.

<CLAIMS>
A connecting member for connecting a metal fitting 
to a plastic pipe for liquid media, wherein the part 

for directly screwing to the fitting is made of a 
plastic considerably stronger than the part for welding 

to the pipe, i.e. a polymer having a structure 
substantially made up of phenyl ring systems linked by 

the following atoms or groups of atoms: O, S, CO, SO
2
, 
NH, NHCO and/or OCO, characterised in that the main 

part (1) of the connecting member, which determines the 
outer shape thereof and comprises the thread (2) for 

the fitting, is made of the stronger plastic and only 
has a sleeve (3) made of the weaker material, e.g. a 

polyolefin, for the welded connection to the pipe. 
A connecting member according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the main part (1) of the 

connecting member made of the stronger plastic and 
receiving the sleeve (3) is given a profiled inner or 

outer surface (at 4) to form a labyrinth seal, and the 
seal is injection-moulded or embedded in the main part 

(1).
