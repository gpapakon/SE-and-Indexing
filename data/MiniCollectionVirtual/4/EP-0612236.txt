<ABSTRACT>
There is provided bath lift apparatus (12) which utilises a collapsible fluid actuated piston (26) connected to the domestic cold water supply to lift a seat (14) from adjacent the floor of the bath to adjacent the rim of the bath. Deflation of the piston (26) provides for controlled descent of the seat (14) from the raised position. The seat (14) and piston (26) are mounted in a lightweight frame (20) which sits on the floor of the bath and which may be readily removed from the bath, if required. Control of the bath lift (12) is achieved by control valves (32) which may be operated by taps or levers mounted on the bath rim within easy reach of the bather.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in bath lifts
and in particular to bath lifts for assisting ingress and
egress from a bath.Many elderly and disabled persons require assistance
in bathing and various lifts and hoists have been
developed to help a person to get into and get out of a
bath. These hoists and lifts include supporting
frameworks which may be located outside or inside the bath
and which support seats which may be lowered from an entry
position, where the seat is at least level with the rim of
the bath, to a bathing position, where the seat is located
as close as possible to the floor of the bath. A number
of the lifts currently available are manually operated by,
for example, turning a handle, though the operation of
such lifts can prove tiring for many persons, particularly
when they are in a seated position. Other lifts are
provided with hydraulic lift arrangements operated by
motor driven pumps, however these tend to be relatively
expensive and complex. A number of lifts, such as the
Tubmate Bath Lift available from Asgo Ltd, are powered by
water pressure, available from the domestic cold water
supply. The Tubmate Bath Lift includes a frame which is
attached to the bath floor by means of four large suction
pads and which includes a vertical mast on which the seat 
is mounted. However, the Tubmate Lift is relatively heavy
and can prove awkward to remove to permit an able bodied
person to use the bath, and installation requires the
services of a plumber.Water pressure is also used to lift the bather in the
Tamplin Lifting Bath Cushion, available from Davis Tamplin,
which is simply a cushion which may be filled to lift the
bather from the floor of the bath, though the cushion only
rises to within 80 mm of the bath rim and thus does not
assist in entry and exit from the bath.EP-A-0347652 discloses a bath lift including a frame
having a portion for engaging the bath floor and a seat,
with a scissors type frame therebetween. The seat is
lifted by inflation of a flexible element with pressurised
fluid, a valve controlling the flow fluid to the element.It is one of the objects of the present invention to
provide a bath lift which is of lightweight construction
and thus can be removed from and fitted to a bath without
difficulty.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide a bath lift which may operate using water pressure
supplied from a domestic water supply system and which may
be readily connected to the system.It is a still further object of the present invention
to provide

<CLAIMS>
Bath lift apparatus (12) for assisting ingress and
egress from a bath, the apparatus comprising:


a frame (20) having a lower frame portion (22) for
engaging the bath floor and an upper frame portion (24);
a seat (14) pivotally mounted to the upper frame
portion (24);
fluid actuated lifting means (26) located between the
lower frame portion and the seat;
conduit means (34) for connecting the lifting means to

a pressurised fluid source (28); and
control means (32) for controlling the supply of
pressurised fluid to the lifting means to permit inflation

thereof to lift the seat and to permit deflation thereof to
lower the seat;

   characterised in that the lower frame portion (22)
includes a bath floor engaging first part (62) rigidly

connected to a second part extending upwardly and
rearwardly therefrom to a pivotal connection with the upper

frame portion (24) which extends forwardly from said
connection, the seat (14) being pivotally mounted to a

front part of the upper frame portion.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
lifting means is in the form of a collapsible, inextensible 

fluid actuated piston (26).
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
piston includes reinforcing hoops (90).
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the
hoops (90) are concentric and have stepped diameters such

that, in the collapsed configuration, the hoops fit within
one another.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the conduit means (34) is

arranged for temporary connection to an adjacent cold water
tap (28).
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to
4, wherein the conduit means is arranged for connection to

pump means.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the conduit means (36) is

arranged to drain into an adjacent wash hand basin (30) or
w.c. on deflation of the lifting means (26).
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, further including a secondary frame (54) 

arranged to maintain the seat (14) horizontal as it is
raised and lowered.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
secondary frame (54) is provided between the seat (14) and

the forward part of the lower frame portion (22).
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
secondary frame (96) is provided between the rear part of

the first frame and the seat.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in claim 10, wherein
the seat (92) is slidably mounted on a seat frame (94)

itself pivotally mounted to the front of the upper portion
of the frame (86) and the secondary frame (96) is arranged

to hold the seat (92) to follow a substantially vertical
path as the upper portion of the frame (96) pivots on the

lower portion of the frame.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the control means (32) includes

valves (38, 40) for controlling flow to and from the
lifting means (26).
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in claim 12, wherein
valve operators are located in a module (41) arranged for 

mounting on the rim of the bath.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, including a valve (42) for closing the

supply of fluid to the lifting means (26) when the seat
(14) reaches a predetermined fully raised position.
Bath lift apparatus as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims including side flaps (114, 116) pivotably

attached to the seat (92), which flaps (114, 116) extend
over the bath rim (117) when the seat (92) is raised and

then pivot upwardly as the seat (92) is lowered to hold the
user on the seat and prevent the user's fingers from being

caught between the seat (92) and frame portions.
