<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to simplify the state of the art, to increase design possibilities at the planning stage, and to reduce the overall building time by introducing finished material modules (12-24, 56, 90, 113) in general of a new type. In order to modify the chronology of a construction so as to increase efficiency and reduce costs, the end design (2) of the visible surfaces having one or several sides is in general calculated already from the stage of the individual statically bearing core building elements (1, 55, 57, 100, 101), maintaining or improving the diffusion capacity of the composite material (12-24, 56, 90, 113). For that purpose, the disclosed core building element (1, 55, 57, 100, 101) is provided on its side facing a visible surface element (2) with one or several grooves (4, 44) that form direct rear airing channels having any desired geometric cross-section and volume for a visible surface element (2). The visible surface element (2) is permanently glued to the tangential, planar ribs (37) between ajacent rear airing channels (4, 44) and the free surfaces in the volume area of the rear airing channels (4, 44) are preferably coated with known diffusion-capable, heat- and damp-proofing substances (8, 9, 10). This arrangement of the rear airing channels (4, 44) allows the central elements (1, 55, 57, 100, 101) to preserve their own diffusion capacity, on the one hand, and on the hand it allows any desired, flat visible surface end design material (2) to be aired from the rearside (36). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, given the rear airing channels (4, 44) facing the inner side of the building and directly arranged behind a visible surface element (2), the disclosed building system, composite materials and prefabricated elements (12-14, 56, 90, 113) are preferably used for constructing buildings in which heating and/or ventilation are integrated from the beginning. Parallel vertical and/or horizontal heating or ventilation pathways (40) with no externally visible units are thus directly obtained in static wall, floor, ceiling and roof structures.
