<ABSTRACT>
A pipe-shaped ventilating device (4) having a collar (11) for mounting in a plastic foil or a similar flexible material, e.g. a water-tight foil, placed on the rafters of a roof construction in order to provide for circulation from the air space (5) under the foil (3) is formed to be mounted by a spiral movement around the edge of an opening shaped in the foil. The collar (11) is provided with an upper wall (12) and a lower wall (13), of which the latter is provided with a slit (14) obliquely directed towards the pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A VENTILATING DEVICE FOR MOUNTING IN A PLA5TICS FOIL OR A SIMILAR FLEXIBLE MATERIAL.The invention relates to a ventilating device f mounting in a plastic foil or a similar flexible materi for ventilating an air space under the foil and comprisi a comparatively short pipe with a collar around one e thereof.Without being limited to this purpose, the inventi especially aims at providing a simple and easily ountab ventilating device to be mounted in a water-tight fo positioned under a roof covering in order to ventilate t air space under such foil against the roof covering.Due to leaks in a roof covering a water-tight foil often placed below the covering when it is impossible tighten the roof covering from the inside because of a internal insulation. In such places in the roof whe trimmings for e.g. skylights or chimneys are provided fo and where the passage of the air from the air space belo the foil to the roof covering is consequently impeded, venthole has to be mounted in order to create sufficien ventilation for avoiding dew which might seep through th layers of the roof.From the Danish Published Specification No. 147365 ventilating device of the kind referred to above is know in which a layer of a weather-resisting adhesive has bee applied to the underside of the collar turning away fro the pipe.This known ventilating device is mounted in th wanted place by glueing it on the upper side of the foi and then cutting away the covered area of the foil insid the ventilating device. Besides creating circulation fro the underside of the foil to the roof covering, through th leaks of which the air will then escape into th atmosphere, the ventilating device will effectively preven rainwater, seeping down the foil under the roof covering from penetrating through the foil where the ventilatinSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

device has been placed as the water will thus run round the ventilation device.However, moun-ting this known ventilating device is a rather time-consuming operation, and in practice it has been found that under certain conditions, e.g. when the foil is stiff with cold, moist or is smudgy, it is difficult to make the adhesion between the foil and the collar of the ventilating device sufficiently watertight to avoid water seeping through the foil. From US - A - 3892169 a rather complicated embodiment is known, in which the ventilating device comprises a lower collar which is placed in the foil from the underside thereof and is coupled with a collar element which is mounted from the outer side of the foil and

P A T E N T C L A I M S
1. A ventilating device for mounting in a plastic foil or a similar flexible material for ventilating an air- filled space below the foil and comprising a comparatively short pipe (10) with a collar (11) around one end thereof, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the collar (11) comprises an upper wall (12) and a lower wall (13) firmly connected therewith to be placed on either side of the foil around an opening therein corresponding to the light opening of the pipe, and that the lower wall (13) of the collar (11) is provided with a slit (14) obliquely directed towards the pipe (10) for mounting the ventilating device from one side of the foil by a spiral movement.
2. A ventilating device as claimed in claim 1, c h a r- a c t e r i z e d in that said slit (14) runs substantially tangentially towards the pipe (10).
3. A ventilating device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the slit (14) has walls (15, 16) which diverge towards its mouth (17) at the periphery of the collar.
4. A ventilating device as claimed in claims 1, 2 or 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that an outer wall (15) of the slit (14) is rounded towards the peripheral mouth (17) of the slit and is obliquely positioned in relation to the plane of the collar (11).
5. A ventilating device according to any of the preceeding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that with a view to mounting the ventilating device in a water-tight foil positioned under a roof covering said pipe is of a shorter length than the distance between the foil and the roof covering in order to provide for circulation from the air space under the foil to the roof covering.
