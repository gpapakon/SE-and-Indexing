<ABSTRACT>
It is herein disclosed a novel elastomeric polybutylene-1 having an exhibiting syndiotacticity of greater than ten percent, and possessing other desirable properties. The novel elastomeric polybutylene-1 can be blended with compatible materials such as polypropylene and its copolymers, ethylene-propylene block copolymers, butyl rubbers and polyisobutylene. Such compositions are particularly suitable in textile and fiber applications. The novel elastomeric polybutylene-1 can also be blended with incompatible materials such as ethylenically unsaturated esters (EVA, EMA, EMAA, EEA), polyester, nylon, polystyrene, styrene block copolymers (SEBS, SIS, SBS) and polyethylenes into a composition having soft and improved elastic properties. Such blends are particularly useful in easy-open packaging and foam applications, and in PVC replacement. When oriented, films made of such blends are used as soft and elastic shrink films. The novel elastomeric polybutylene-1 can also be blended with both incompatible and compatible materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to novel polymers of 1-butene.
More particularly, this invention relates to
elastomeric polybutylene-1 polymers.Thermoplastic, predominantly isotactic homo- and
copolymers of 1-butene, commonly referred to as poly-1-butene
or polybutylene (conventional polybutene-1) are known in the
art. Elastomeric polymers including elastomeric polybutylene-1
are also known in the art. In certain applications, there has
been an effort to replace conventional polybutylene-1 with
elastomeric polybutylene-1. These applications include film
sheets and packaging film where the elastic nature of the
elastomeric polybutylene-1 is preferred.Packaging films are required to have certain
characteristics which are desirable for the particular
application. For example, films which are used for wrapping
food such as vegetables, meat or fish, are minimally required
to have a good puncture resistance and a good elastic recovery,
sometimes also referred to as memory. A good puncture
resistance is particularly important when packaging meat with
bones because of the greater likelihood of the bones puncturing
the film. Good recovery properties are particularly important
in packaging food. Usually, the food is sold in service or
convenience stores, or in grocery stores where many customers
touch the packages. These touchings deform the film, and
without the ability to sufficiently recover, the packaged food
looks unfresh and often cannot be sold anymore.WO90/12816 describes a process and a catalyst for the
production of elastomeric, primarily stereoregular poly-α-olefin
characterized by a relatively narrow distribution of
relatively short block lengths.It is an object of the invention to provide an
elastomeric polybutylene-1 having significantly improved
properties.It is a further object of the invention to provide an
elastomeric polybutylene-1 having a significant amount of
syndiotacticity.Accordingly, there is now provided an elastomeric 
polybutylene-1 having and exhibiting syndiotacticity of greater
than ten (10) percent.The present invention provides a blend of a polymer
composition consisting essentially of elastomeric polybutylene-1
(ELPB) wherein said elastomeric polybutene-1 has and exhibits
syndiotacticity of greater than ten percent and of at least one
compatible or incompatible material.The inventive elastomeric polybutylene-1 can be blended
with compatible materials such as polypropylene and its
copolymers, ethylene-propylene block copolymers, butyl rubbers,
and polyisobutylene into a
