<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gradation
compensating apparatus for a video signal for improving a
television picture quality.Recently, gradation compensating apparatus for
video signals have been recognized as being
important for realizing high picture quality.
Specifically, high picture quality is realized by
preventing picture suppression and black level buoying.
As a result, by improving the picture gradation, the 
devices have been found to be useful for large color
television receivers and for applications where high
picture quality is required.FIG. 1 shows input-output characteristic curves
of a black level compensating circuit of a gradation
compensating apparatus for a video signal in accordance
with the prior art. The abscissa is an input voltage
level and the ordinate is an output voltage level. The
abscissa marked 1 shows an input voltage level
corresponding to the minimum brightness level and the
range marked 2 shows an input voltage level corresponding
to the brightness of a skin color portion of the input
video signal. The curve 3 shows an input-output
characteristic without compensation and the output
voltage level is proportional to the input voltage level.
The curve 4 shows a characteristic with compensation.In the characteristics of the black level
compensating circuit shown in FIG. 1, when the minimum
brightness level is as marked by 1, the picture appears
if its black level is buoyant. In order to improve the
picture gradation, the minimum brightness level is
lowered to a level which is lower than that of the input
and there is no level drift due to black level
compensation. The slant of the characteristic curve 3
without compensation is made steep and the input voltage
level of the minimum brightness level is compensated to
approach the pedestal level. Thus, the gradation of the
black portion is improved. The higher the average
picture level (APL) is, the stronger the compensation is
controlled.However, because only the brightness signal is
compensated, as a result, the balance between the color 
signal and the brightness signal deteriorates. This creates a problem in that the colour
red and the colour of skin become dull. These are colours which are highly sensitive
to the human eyes, especially in a high APL picture.EP-A-0460595 discloses apparatus for correcting a black level of a
video signal. In this apparatus the black tone of the video signal is expanded
according to the detected blackest portion of the video signal. In a preferred
embodiment the degree of the expansion
