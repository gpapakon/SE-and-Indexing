<ABSTRACT>
A furnace for melting and refining E glass comprises a melting and refining tank for melting and refining the glass batch materials into glass and a forhearth, downstream of the tank, for further refining the glass and delivering the glass to fiberizing means. The melting and refining tank is heated with oxygen fired burners. The oxygen fired burners in the melting and refining tank are located in the sidewalls at the upstream end of the tank and extend for about one-third the length of the tank. In one embodiment, burners are also located in the upstream end wall. This arrangement of the oxygen fired burners at the upstream end of the melting and refining tank moves the melter hot spot upstream for better refining of the glass and enables the furnace to produce a higher output of glass than can be obtained in a conventional E glass furnace of the same size.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a furnace for melting and 
refining glass according to the preamble of claim 1; it 
furthermore relates to a method of melting and refining 
glass as defined in the preamble of claim 9. It thus 
deals with an apparatus and a method for producing 
glass filaments and other glass products by melting and 
refining glass in a furnace that uses burners located 
in the opposed side walls of the melting and refining 
tank. In the manufacture of glass, such as E glass 
fibers or filaments, by a continuous melting process, 
glass batch material is delivered to a furnace at the 
upstream end of the melting and refining tank. The 
glass batch material is melted and refined as it passes 
through the melting and refining tank to a forehearth 
which is connected to the downstream end of the melting 
and refining tank. The glass is withdrawn from the 
melting and refining tank into a conditioning section 
of the forehearth from which the glass passes to the 
working forehearth where the glass is distributed to 
fiber forming equipment and withdrawn from the 
forehearth through the fiber forming equipment to form 
the fibers or filaments. A furnace and a method of the 
generic type respectively are disclosed in DE-A-1496043 
(corresponding to US-A-3337324). In conventional E glass furnaces of the type shown 
in Fig. 1, the glass batch materials are melted by 
directly opposed air/gas fired burners which extend for 
substantially the entire length of the melting and 
refining tank. The forehearth is also fired with 
directly opposed air/gas burners to further refine the 
glass and to regulate and maintain the glass at the  
 
desired temperature for the fiber or filament forming 
process. In a typical combustion process using an air/gas 
fired burner, natural gas and air is usually combined 
in a set ratio of 10 parts air to 1 part natural gas by 
volume. The main drawback to this method of combustion 
is the nitrogen content of air which constitutes 78% of 
air by volume and  
 
contributes nothing to the combustion process. Thus with 
air/gas fired burners, large volumes of air are required 
relative the volume of natural gas consumed. The 
relatively large volumes of combustion air and the 
resulting large volumes of exhaust gases which must be 
processed using air/gas fired burners require the use of 
costly, high volume combustion air and exhaust gas systems. For more efficient combustion, the air supplied to the 
air/gas fired burners should be preheated from ambient 
temperatures to
