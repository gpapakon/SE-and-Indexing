<ABSTRACT>
A cadmium telluride crystal ingot with a small 
amount of chlorine added or a wafer cut out of such a cadmium 

telluride crystal ingot is heat-treated at a temperature 
ranging from 250°C to 450°C for at least 20 hours. The cadmium 

telluride crystal thus heat-treated has a value µτ of at 
least 2.0 x 10⁻³cm²/V, which is the product of the carrier mobility 

µ and the carrier life τ. A radiation detector made of 
the cadmium telluride crystal has a stable output signal for 

a long period of time after an X ray starts being applied 
thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chlorine-doped 
CdTe crystal for use in a radiation detector, and a method of 
manufacturing such a chlorine-doped CdTe crystal. Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is a semiconductor having 
a higher radiation absorption coefficient and a larger energy 
gap at normal temperature than silicon (Si) and germanium 
(Ge). Therefore, radiation detectors made of CdTe have better 
characteristics than those made of Si and Ge. It has been customary for CdTe radiation detectors 
to have a general structure in which two electrodes are attached 
to two respective confronting surfaces of a crystal 
for applying a bias voltage therebetween. The CdTe radiation 
detectors of such a structure detect a current which is produced 
when positive and negative carriers (hole-electron 
pairs) generated when the CdTe crystal is exposed to a radiation 
are attracted to the electrodes. It is important that CdTe crystals for use in radiation 
detectors have a high electric resistance so that no 
current flows when they are not exposed to any radiation, and 
that positive and negative carriers generated by exposure to 
a radiation have a long life in order to increase the  
 
radiation-to-current conversion factor. Heretofore, it has been known that high-resistance 
CdTe crystals which meet the above requirements can be produced 
by doping CdTe crystals with chlorine. For increasing 
the carrier life, it is necessary to reduce the amount of 
chlorine to be doped. Japanese laid-open patent publications 
Nos. 4-97990, 4-97991, and 4-97992, for example, disclose 
proposals for reducing the amount of chlorine to be doped. 
According to the disclosed processes, a chlorine-doped CdTe 
crystal is heat-treated at a temperature in the range of from 
350 to 450°C after the crystal has been formed, or annealed 
in a temperature range up to 450°C or lower, for thereby 
producing a device of high energy resolution which is made of 
a crystal having a low chlorine content. Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 3-349400 
reveals a process of producing a device of high energy resolution 
by heat-treating a chlorine-doped CdTe crystal ingot, 
which has been grown by THM (traveling heater method), in a 
temperature range from 500 to 900°C, and then heat-treating 
the chlorine-doped CdTe crystal ingot at a temperature of 
450°C or lower. However, it has been found that when a radiation 
detector made of a chlorine-doped CdTe crystal heat-treated 
according to the conventional process is in continuous operation 
under a
