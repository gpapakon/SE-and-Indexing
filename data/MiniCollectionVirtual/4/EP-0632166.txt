<ABSTRACT>
An applicator containing a highly viscous marking product, which is forced out through outlet openings (13) which run transversely to the movement direction and parallel to the road surface (2), can be closed by closure elements (11) and have a width corresponding to the width of the marking lines (14), has a housing which leads the marking product up to the outlet opening (13) and is composed, in accordance with the desired maximum application widths, of a basic housing element (5) to which the marking product is supplied from the storage container via connecting elements (3), and of one or more additional housing elements (25), the separating faces (24) between the individual housing elements running perpendicularly to the road surface in the movement direction. The marking product-conveying chambers (8,20) extend here through all housing elements exhibiting an outlet opening (9). A movable sidewall in the region of the closure elements (11) permits the adjustment of the lateral play of the closure elements (11) and prevents impermissible stresses owing to varying shrinkages during the cooling of the device.

<CLAIMS>
Applicator for road marking devices for the application 
of highly viscous marking products on road surfaces 

wherein the applicator comprises discharging 
apertures extending transversely to the direction of 

movement, and substantially in parallel with the 
road surface when in operation, and closable with 

one or several closing elements arranged side-by-side, 
with widths corresponding with the widths of 

the application, and with a housing guiding the marking 
product to the discharging apertures, 


characterized in,
that the housing is composed of a housing base member 
(5, 5', 5") comprising the connection for the 

supply of the marking product, and at least one 
additional housing member (28, 29, 31, 32) attached 

to the housing base member wherein the separating 
surfaces (24) between the housing members extend 

substantially vertical to the road surface, and in 
parallel with the direction of movement when in 

operation. 
Applicator according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the housing members are detachably connected 

with each other. 
Applicator according to claim 1, characterized in 
that two of the housing members comprise only a 

single separating surface (24) with additional housing  
 

chambers (25‴, 25"") ending at this separating 
surface (24), and with additional discharging 

apertures (26‴, 26"") for the marking product 
ending at this separating surface. 
Applicator according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least one housing member 

(5", 30) comprises two separating surfaces (24), 
and additional housing chambers (25"‴) extending 

from the one separating surface to the other, and 
additional discharging apertures (26"‴) for the 

marking product extending from the one separating 
surface to the other. 
Applicator according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that at least one housing member 

(30) comprises only a single separating surface (24) 
and no discharging aperture for the marking product. 
Applicator according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the separating surfaces (24) 

between the housing members coincide with contact 
surfaces between adjacent closing elements. 
Applicator according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the housing chambers guiding 

the marking product are divided into at least two 
chambers arranged substantially in parallel and connected 

by laterally closed passages. 
Applicator according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the housing base member (5, 

5', 5") forms a unit with the connecting housing 
(3) to a reservoir. 
Applicator according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that housing members are manufactured  

 
of light metal, preferably of aluminium. 
Applicator according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that at least one of the outer 

housing members (40) comprises a laterally displaceable 
boundary wall (42) in the area of the 

closing elements (11). 
Applicator according to claim 10, characterized in 
that the displacement of the displaceable boundary 

wall (42) towards the side facing away from the 
closing elements (11) is limited by a displaceable 

stop (44) which in direction towards the closing 
elements (11) is pressed again a travel limitation 

by a spring (47), and that a distance between the 
displaceable boundary wall and the stop is continuously 

adjustable. 
Applicator according to claim 11, characterized in 
that the displaceable boundary wall (42) comprises a 

screwable insert (43) supported at a stop (44) 
pressed in direction towards the closing elements 

(11) by a spring (47), and comprising a travel limitation 
(48), and contacting a housing member (45) 

with a preset travel distance in direction towards 
the closing elements (11).
