<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of expandable and deformable intraluminal 
vascular grafts are expanded within a blood vessel by an 

angioplasty balloon associated with a catheter to dilate and 
expand the lumen of a blood vessel. The grafts may be thin-­

walled tubular members (71) having a plurality of slots (82) disposed 
substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 

tubular members (71), and adjacent grafts are flexibly connected 
by a single connector member disposed substantially parallel 

to the longitudinal axis of the tubular members.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an expandable 
intraluminal graft for use within a body passageway or 
duct and, more particularly, expandable intraluminal 
vascular grafts which are particularly useful for 
repairing blood vessels narrowed or occluded by 
disease, as specified in the preamble 
of Claim 1. Such a graft or prosthesis is known from document 
EP-A-0221570. Intraluminal endovascular grafting has been 
demonstrated by experimentation to present a possible 
alternative to conventional vascular surgery. 
Intraluminal endovascular grafting involves the 
percutaneous insertion into a blood vessel of a tubular 
prosthetic graft and its delivery via a catheter to the 
desired location within the vascular system. 
Advantages of this method over conventional vascular 
surgery include obviating the need for surgically 
exposing, incising, removing, replacing, or bypassing 
the defective blood vessel.  
 Structures which have previously been used as 
intraluminal vascular grafts have included coiled 
stainless steel springs; helically wound coil springs 
manufactured from an expandable heat-sensitive 
material; and expanding stainless steel stents formed 
of stainless steel wire in a zig-zag pattern. In 
general, the foregoing structures have one major 
disadvantage in common. Insofar as these structures 
must be delivered to the desired location within a 
given body passageway in a collapsed state, in order to 
pass through the body passageway, there is no effective 
control over the final, expanded configuration of each 
structure. For example, the expansion of a particular 
coiled spring-type graft is predetermined by the spring 
constant and modulus of elasticity of the particular 
material utilized to manufacture the coiled spring 
structure. These same factors predetermine the amount 
of expansion of collapsed stents formed of stainless 
steel wire in a zig-zag pattern. In the case of 
intraluminal grafts, or prostheses, formed of a heat 
sensitive material which expands upon heating, the 
amount of expansion is likewise predetermined by the 
heat expansion characteristics of the particular alloy 
utilized in the manufacture of the intraluminal graft. Thus, once the foregoing types of intraluminal 
grafts are expanded at the desired location within a 
body passageway, such as within an artery or vein, the 
expanded size of the graft cannot be changed. If the 
diameter of the desired body passageway has been 
miscalculated, an undersized graft might not expand 
enough to contact the interior surface of

<CLAIMS>
1. An expandable intraluminal vascular graft or prosthesis (70) 
comprising:
 
   a least one of thin-walled tubular member (71) 

having first and second ends (72,73) and a wall 
surface disposed between the first and second 

ends, the wall surface having a substantially 
uniform thickness and a plurality of slots (82) 

formed therein, the slots (82) being disposed 
substantially parallel to the longitudinal 

axis of said tubular member (71);
 
   the tubular member (71) having a first diameter which 

permits intraluminal delivery of the tubular 
members into a body passageway (80) having a 

lumen (81); and
 
   the tubular members having a second, expanded and 

deformed diameter, upon the application from 
the interior of the tubular member of a 

radially, outwardly extending force, which 
second diameter is variable and dependent 

upon the amount of force applied to the  

 
tubular member (71), whereby the tubular members 

may be expanded and deformed to expand the 
lumen of the body passageway, 

characterized in that the 
vascular graft or prosthesis (70) comprises a plurality of tubular 

members (71) and 
a single connector member (100) being disposed between 

adjacent tubular members to flexiby connect 
adjacent tubular members, the single 

connector member being disposed in a 
substantially parallel relationship with 

respect to the longitudinal axis of the 
tubular members and coplanar with each 

tubular member. 
2. The expandable intraluminal graft of claim 1, 
wherein the single connector member is a thin-walled, 

elongate bar member (101), coplanar with adjacent tubular 
members. 
3. The expandable intraluminal graft of claim 1, 
wherein a first connector member is disposed between 

the second end of a first tubular member (70A) and the first 
end of a second tubular member (70B); a second connector 

member is disposed between the second end of the second 
tubular member (70B) and the first end of a third tubular 

member (70C), the first and second connector members being 
angularly offset from one another with respect to the 

longitudinal axis of the tubular members (70A,70B,70C).
