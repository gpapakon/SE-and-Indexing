<ABSTRACT>
An arrester (10) has a plurality of laminated 
columns (20A,20B,20C,20D) arranged in parallel, each 

having a plurality of non-linear conduction elements 
(25). 

The columns (20A,20B,20C,20D) are electrically 
interconnected by conductive connection members (27A) 

so that a conduction path is defined by the conduction 
elements (25) and the connection members (27A). The 

columns (20A,20B,20C,20D) are arranged around, and in 
contact with, an insulating support column (22), which 

provides mechanical strength for the arrester (10). 
A plurality of such arresters (10) may be arranged in 

an array (20X1,20X2), the arresters (10) being 
interconnected by further insulating support columns 

(21). 
The laminated columns (20A,20B,20C,20D) also 

contain insulating spacers and the spacers of two or 
more laminated columns (20A,20B,20C,20D) may be 

rigidly interconnected (26C). The arresters (10) may 
be mounted in a casing (2) filled with an insulating 

gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrester, 
which may be used, for example, as an over-voltage 
suppression unit in an electric power transmission 
system. The present invention also relates to an 
arrester assembly incorporating a plurality of 
arresters, and to a method of forming an arrester 
assembly. It is normal to transmit electric power from the 
site at which it is generated, e.g. a power station, 
to the sites where it is to be used by overhead 
cables. If such cables are struck by lightning, an 
over-voltage appears on the cables which may result in 
damage to electrical devices connected to the 
transmission system. For this reason, it is common to 
connect one or more arresters to electrical power 
transmission systems, which arresters act as over-voltage 
suppression devices. There are many different types of arresters. In 
one known type, the arrester is in the form of a 
column, having a plurality of conductive elements 
which are laminated together. The conductive elements 
have a non-linear characteristic. This may be  
 
achieved by making them of suitable material, such as 
zinc oxide. In known examples of such arresters, the 
conductive elements have an annular cross-section and 
are mounted on an insulating rod. The over-voltage suppression effect of such an 
arrester depends on the number and thickness of the 
conductive elements. In order to prevent the arrester 
from becoming too long, it has been proposed that a 
plurality of laminated columns be provided, arranged 
in parallel, with the columns being electrically 
connected together. In this way, by forming a 
conduction path extending along the between the 
columns (by use of suitable electrical connection 
members interconnecting the columns at intermediate 
points along their length), it is possible to provide 
a sufficiently long conduction path without making the 
arrester excessively long. Examples of such arresters 
are disclosed in JP-A-56-91402 and JP-A-56-164502. Although an arrester comprising a plurality of 
laminated columns has the advantage that the overall 
length of the arrester can be minimized, it has been 
found that the length remains sufficiently long that 
the arrester is vulnerable to mechanical shock. If a 
mechanical shock, such as an earthquake, is applied to 
the arrester, the columns will vibrate and may be 
broken. This is a particular problem if protection 
against very high over-voltages is needed, since then  
 
the length of the arrester is long, even if it is 
formed by a plurality of
