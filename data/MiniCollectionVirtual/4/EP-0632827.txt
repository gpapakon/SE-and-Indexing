A method of producing high cell densities in a 
reaction system consisting of at least two chambers 

coupled with one another by means of a membrane and 
in which the culture of micro-organisms or plant or 

animal cells to be fed with nutrients are placed in 
one chamber and the growth-inhibiting reaction 

products in the chamber are able to pass out from 
this chamber through the membrane and into the 

solution in the other chamber, characterised by the 
following features in combination: 


a) a membrane, of which there is at least one, is 
directly integrated in the chamber containing 

the culture of micro-organisms, plant cells or 
animal cells 
b) the other chamber, of which there is at least 
one, contains a salt solution containing no 

carbon source which, after the start-up phase 
of the reaction system, will enable the osmotic 

balance to be established through the at least 
one membrane 
c) a quantity of oxygen is introduced into the 
chamber containing the culture of micro-organisms, 

plant cells or vegetable cells in 
order to produce rapid growth of the culture on 

a technically viable scale 
d) a highly concentrated liquid nutrient 
containing a carbon substance is fed into the 

chamber containing the culture of micro-organisms, 

plant cells or animal cells in a 
quantity that is dependent on the oxygen input. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that a nutrient solution containing the nutrients is 

initially fed into each chamber in the start-up 
phase and, when the supply of nutrient is no longer 

sufficient to feed the culture through the at least 
one membrane, the highly-concentrated nutrient 

solution is fed directly into the chamber containing 
the culture. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that growth-inhibiting reaction products that 

have penetrated the salt solution from the chamber 
containing the culture of micro-organisms, plant 

cells or animal cells are removed, along with the 
salt solution, from the chamber housing the salt 

solution. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that an adsorbing resin is added to the salt 

solution so that the growth-inhibiting reaction 
products that have penetrated the salt solution bond 

with the adsorbing resin and are neutralised 
thereby. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that an XAD-adsorber is used as the adsorbing resin. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the highly concentrated nutrient solution 

additionally contains vitamins or other growth-promoting 
substances. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that glycerine is used as the highly concentrated 

nutrient solution.  
 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that water mixed with nutrient salts is used as the 

salt solution. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that additional nutrient salts are fed into the 

chambers containing the salt solution, which will be 
consumed by the growth of the culture. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 to 9, 
characterised in that the culture is placed in an 

inner chamber, formed by means of a cylindrically 
shaped membrane, and designed such that it is 

inside the outer chamber of the reactor filled with 
the additional salt solution. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which the salt 
solution is fed, together with the growth-inhibiting 

reaction products, out of the reaction system, 
characterised in that the salt solution is pumped 

back into the reaction system, wherein a column 
containing an adsorbing resin is connected into the 

fluid circuit. 
A method as claimed in claim 11, characterised in 
that a heat exchanger is also connected into the 

fluid circuit. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the chambers containing the salt solution are 

designed as membrane modules connected in parallel 
and joined to one another. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the culture to be fed is grown  

 
to a given density and then drawn off in batches. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the culture to be fed is grown 

to a given density and the fluid containing the 
organisms is then continuously removed from the 

chamber containing the culture and the same quantity 
of liquid nutrient medium is fed continuously into 

this chamber. 
A device for implementing the method as claimed in 
claims 1 to 15 having a reactor (13), in the 

interior of which a membrane module (17) is 
arranged, through which a dialysis liquid containing 

salt is fed, which picks up and feeds away the 
growth-inhibiting reaction products, characterised 

in that a column (14) containing an adsorbing resin 
is incorporated in the fluid circuit (20) of the 

membrane module (17). 
A device as claimed in claim 16, characterised in 
that at least two membrane modules (17) are provided 

in the reactor (13) and connected in parallel. 
A device as claimed in claim 16 and 17, 
characterised in that a heat exchanger is provided 

in the fluid circuit (20). 
A device as claimed in claim 16 to 18, characterised 
in that a stirring mechanism is arranged in the 

reactor (13).
