<ABSTRACT>
In a picture encoding apparatus, detection of a moving vector of half-pixel 
precision is executed by using a single clock without increasing the number of frame 

memories. 
Time-series input pixel data is transformed into parallel pixel data; the parallel 
pixel data obtained through the transformation is interpolated to thereby generate 

interpolating data on each pixel in an area specified by a moving vector of one-pixel 
precision. The interpolation data is output in parallel as pixel data on a plurality of 

interpolation block areas (B1, B2) obtained by displacing by 1/2 pixel the block area 
(B1, B2) specified by the moving vector at one-pixel unit, thereby making it possible to 

quickly obtain interpolation data solely on a region around the area specified by the 
moving vector at one-pixel unit. 
With this arrangement, interpolation can be executed with a substantially 
simplified construction as compared to the prior art, making it possible to easily detect 

a moving vector of half-pixel precision without increasing the number of frame 
memories of clock frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for compressing a digital motion 
picture signal in which the efficiency of the compression is increased to 
reduce the quantity of data to be transmitted. Conventional techniques for compressing a digital motion picture 
signal obtain a motion vector before quantizing the digital motion picture 
signal and quantize the motion picture signal in response to the motion 
vector. Compressors that compress a digital motion picture signal in 
response to a motion vector are disclosed in such patents as United States 
patent nos. 4,982,285, 4,985,768, and 4,985,768. Generally, a motion picture signal has a high correlation between 
portions of the motion picture signal representing two consecutive frames, 
except when scene changes occur. Thus a motion picture signal can be 
compressed by determining the differences in the pixel data between 
consecutive frames of the motion picture signal, and then quantizing these 
differences. However, if the picture includes moving portions, the quantity of 
difference data can be large. For this reason, a method called block matching 
is preferably used. Figs. 1A to 1C are diagrams explaining the principles of block 
matching. The nth frame (Figure 1A) and the n+1th frame (Figure 1B) are  
 
compared. In these frames, the image portion labelled "tree" is almost 
unchanged between the frames. Therefore, the error resulting from replacing 
the image portion "tree" in the n+1th frame (Figure 1B) with the image 
portion "tree" of the nth frame (Figure 1A) is rarely perceptible. On the other hand, the image portion "car" in the n+1th frame cannot 
similarly be replaced by the image portion "car" in the nth frame. The image 
portion "car" in the n+1th frame (Figure 1B) has moved significantly relative 
to the image portion "car" in the nth frame (Figure 1A). This change of 
position of the image portion "car" is shown with solid lines and dotted lines 
in the n+1th frame of Figure 1B. There is almost no change in the image portion "car" itself between 
the nth frame (Figure 1A) and the n+1th frame (Figure 1B), so the image 
portion "car" can therefore be considered to be same in both frames. The 
block containing the image portion "car" in the nth frame (Figure 1A) has 
moved horizontally to the position of the block containing the image portion 
"car" in the n+1th frame (Figure 1B). Thus, the quantity of data required to 
represent the motion picture can then be reduced by analyzing the picture into 
blocks, and expressing the amount and
