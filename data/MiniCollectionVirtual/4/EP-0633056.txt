<ABSTRACT>
The multicomponent metering device is suitable for liquid to pasty media, two gearwheel pairs 5, 6 and 7, 8, each of which have the same number of teeth and the same diameters, but may have different gearwheel thicknesses, being mechanically coupled together via a connection shaft 2. The gearwheel pairs 5, 6 and 7, 8 operate by the gearwheel displacement system, the individual media being passed through separately and exiting again without contacting each other. Mixing only proceeds afterwards. The metering ratios are set via the thickness of the gearwheels of the gearwheel pairs 5, 6 and 7, 8.
