<ABSTRACT>
A casting resin composed of 65 to 95 % by weight methylmethacrylate (MMA) with a dissolved solids content from 5 to 35 % by weight polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), with at least 30000 molecular weight and a weight average Mw which does not exceed 1.3 . 106, is used to produce a positive radiographic resist. A process is also disclosed for producing a radiographic resist, according to which a concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 % by weight azodiisobutyric acid dinitrile (AIBN) is used as initiator and a concentration of less than 0.1 % by weight mercaptane or a non-aromatic mercaptane derivate is used as regulator. The use of said casting resin and this production process allow radiographic resists to be obtained having improved microstructures after exposure to radiation and development.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a casting resin, comprising between 65 and 
95 % by wt. methylmethacrylate (MMA) with a dissolved 

solids content of between 5 and 35 % by wt. 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), the lower molecular weight 

limit of which is at least 30000, and the weight average M
w
 
of which does not exceed 1.3 · 10
6
, for producing a 
positive radiographic resist. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
lower molecular weight limit is at least 40000. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
dispersion of the solids content is less than 3. 
Method of producing a radiographic resist, wherein 

a) a solid, comprising polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), is 
produced by polymerising methylmethacrylate (MMA) with an 

initiator and a regulator, 
b) the solid is dissolved in MMA to form a casting resin, 
c) the casting resin is polymerised in layers in a manner 
known per se, 
 
characterised in that 


d) the lower molecular weight limit of the PMMA produced is 
at least 30000, and a weight average does not exceed 1.3 · 

10
6
, and in that 
e) azodiisobutyric acid dinitrile (AIBN) is used as the 
initiator in a concentration of between 0.2 and 0.4 % by 

wt., and a mercaptan or a non-aromatic mercaptan derivative  
 

is used as the regulator in a concentration of less than 
0.1 % by wt. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the mercaptan represents t-butylmercaptan. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the t-butylmercaptan is used in a concentration of 0.05 % 

by wt. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the casting resin, produced according to step b) by 

dissolving the solid in MMA, is polymerised with benzoyl 
peroxide (BPO) as an additional initiator and with dimethyl 

aniline (DMA) as the activator in a concentration of 
between 0.1 and 2.0 % by wt in each case.
