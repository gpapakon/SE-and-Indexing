<ABSTRACT>
An actuator for use in operating switches such as air break switches of the 
type used on overhead power systems. The actuator is based on an over-centre 

mechanism. Movement of an operating arm (4) indirectly drives a 
drive arm (5) via the over-centre mechanism with the energy of a resilient 

member (12) being used to regulate the opening of a switch connected to 
the drive (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to actuators. In particular, but not exclusively, this invention relates to an actuator for 
use in operating an air break switch of the type used on overhead power 
distribution systems, and also relates to methods of operating air break 
switches. Common types of air break switches used on power distribution systems 
for isolating sections of the distribution system comprise electrical 
contacts which are connected together or separated by means of an 
actuating mechanism. In general there are three sets of contacts for the 
three phases of the distribution system and these are actuated in unison. 
The contacts usually comprise fixed contacts which may be a forked type 
contact, and a movable contact which may be in the form of a blade pivoted 
about one end so that the other end may be moved into and out of contact 
with the fixed contact. Air break switches may be broadly classified into 
side swing types where the movable contact swings sideways in a 
horizontal plane, and vertical types where the movable contact swings in a 
vertical plane. There are also single phase isolator type switches which 
are generally single units fitted to each phase and operated independently 
of each other by a hot stick. The common method of operation of standard vertical type three phase air 
break switches is to use a handle positioned near the base of the power pole 
and pivoted about a support fixed to the power pole so as to have a throw of 
approximately 180 degrees in a vertical plane. The handle is linked to a 
shaft of the air break switch which is located at the top of the power pole, by 
either a metal tube or wooden (treated hardwood) rod. By pulling the 
handle down or pushing up through 180 degrees, the movable contacts of  
 
the air break switch are turned through a predetermined angle thereby 
respectively opening or closing the contacts. With side swing type air break switches, a similar operating method is 
provided except that the operating handle is generally rotated about a 
vertical axis through a predetermined angle. In the case of single phase type isolators, these are generally operated by 
hooking the end of a hot stick (insulated rod) into a ring connected to a 
movable contact and pulling or pushing on the ring to open or close the 
contacts respectively. A problem with these methods of operating air break switches is the 
difficulty in obtaining uniform and optimum speed opening and closing of 
the contacts due to operator variability and difficulty of access. In

<CLAIMS>
An actuator comprising a frame (1a,1b) on which is mounted an 
operating arm (4), a drive arm (5) and an overcentre mechanism 

including a resilient member (12), the operating arm (4) and the 
drive arm (5) being linked together indirectly by way of the 

overcentre mechanism such that movement of the operating arm (4) 
up to a centre point condition of the overcentre mechanism applies a 

load to the resilient member, and further movement past the centre 
point condition results on the load in the resilient member being 

applied to the drive arm (5) thereby causing the drive arm to move. 
An actuator according to claim 1, wherein the overcentre 
mechanism comprises a pair of axially aligned bearings (2a,2b) 

mounted with respect to the frame (1a,1b) a split shaft (3a,3b) 
supported by said bearings, a bush (7) mounted on the split shaft and 

pivot arm (6a,6b) extending from said bush (7) and being connected 
to said resilient member (12), free ends of said split shaft being 

connected to the operating and drive arms (4,5), the arrangement 
being such that pivotal movement of the pivot arms (6a,6b) in one 

direction results in loading of the resilient member (12) up to the 
centre point condition and continued movement past the centre point 

condition results in unloading of the resilient member, the 
operating arm being (4) arranged so as to be engageable with the 

pivot arm (6a,6b) during movement up to the centre point condition 
and the drive arm being arranged so as to be engageable with the 

pivot arm during movement from the centre point condition. 
An actuator according to claim 2, wherein the bush (7) is provided 
with recesses (10a,10b) on end faces thereof and each split shaft is 

provided with a contacting pin (11a,11b), the arrangement being 
such that rotation of the operating arm (4) or it will cause contact 

to occur between the contacting pins (11a,11b) and adjacent edges of 
the recesses (10a,10b) at predetermined times resulting in 

movement of the bush and pivot arm against or with the bias of the 
resilient member. 
An actuator according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the resilient 
member is a spring. 
An actuator according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said drive 
arm (5) or the operating arm (4) includes a biasing element whereby 

movement of said drive arms (5) or operating arm (4) may be 
resiliently restricted or assisted in one direction. 
A method of opening an air-break switch comprising the steps of: 

(i) applying a pulling force on an operating arm (4) connected to an 
over centre actuator so that a resilient member (12) of said actuator 

is progressively loaded and a mounting element of said resilient 

member is moved towards a centre condition with increased loading 
of said resilient member, and 
(ii) continuing to apply said pulling force on said operating arm (4) so 
that said mounting element moves past said centre condition, and 
(iii) allowing the force of said resilient member to act on a lever (5) 
connected to said air-break switch to open the contacts of said 

switch.
