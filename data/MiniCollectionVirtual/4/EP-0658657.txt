<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flashing device with at least one pipe (9) which exhibits an inflow opening, which is in connection with a flushing tank (4) which can be filled with flushing liquid, and an outflow opening (15). The invention proposes that the pipe (9) be mounted pivotably and be assigned to a flushing section, the pipe being provided with an element (13) which exerts on the side pipe (9) a force for erecting the same. The flushing device proposed is distinguished by a particularly simple construction and reliable mode of operation.
