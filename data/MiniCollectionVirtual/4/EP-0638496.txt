<ABSTRACT>
The method consists in controlling the movement of a member (8) for supporting a stack of sheets (12) on the basis of the speed of movement of the rear edge (4b) of a sheet (4a) as it is being introduced. The means comprises a first conveying member (2) followed by a second conveying member (5), both housed in a vacuum box (7), the first conveying member (2) being provided with a supporting member (8) moved by a control member (16) driven in phase with the first conveying member (2).

Method for introducing a plate-like matter, ie corrugated 
cardboard plates, in a machine that processes such a matter owing to a first 

lower transportation organ (2) which acts on the lowermost plate-like matter 
(4a) of a pile (12) of plate-like matters and which is driven with a sequential 

motion, associated to mobile organs (8) for supporting the pile (12) of 
plate-like matters remaining in a store (13), and owing to a second 

transportation organ (5) which is arranged next to the first transportation 
organ (2) as well as driven with a uniform motion, the said transportation 

organs (2, 5) being arranged in a suction case (7), characterized by the fact 
that the motion of the mobile supporting organs (8) is subjected to the 

travelling motion of the rear edge (4b) of the lowermost plate-like matter 
(4a) of the said pile (12) of plate-like matters being introduced, so that the 

mobile supporting organs (8) support the pile (12) of plate-like matters 
remaining in the store (13) according the travelling motion of said 

lowermost plate-like matter (4a). 
Device for bringing into operation the method according to 
claim 1, which comprises a suction case (7) in which are arranged the first 

organs (2) for transporting the plate-like matters (4, 4a), which are driven 
with a sequential motion, the said suction case (7) being placed underneath 

a pile (12) of plate-like matters contained in a store (13) which possesses a 
front wall (14) vertically adjustable with regard to the upper plane of the first 

transportation organs (2) in order to authorize the passage of the lowermost 
plate-like matter (4a) of the pile (12), the second organs (5) for transporting 

the plate-like matters (4a), which are driven with a uniform motion as well 
as arranged next to the first transportation organs (2), and the mobile 

organs (8) supporting the pile (12) of plate-like matters, characterized by 
the fact that the mobile organs (8) for supporting the pile (12) of plate-like 

matters include an assembly of rollers (11a to 11e) fitted on small rods (9a 
to 9e) driven by oscillating crosswise shafts (10a to 10e), the said assembly 

of rollers (11a to 11e) being arranged on either sides of the first organs (2)  
 

for transporting the plate-like matters (4a), by the fact that each oscillating 
crosswise shaft (10a to 10e) is provided at one of its ends with a lever (18a 

to 18e) controlled by a driving organ (16) driven in phase with the traveling 
motion of the rear edge (4b) of the lowermost plate-like matter (4a) being 

introduced, the said lever (18a to 18e) being equipped with pull-back 
means (15) which apply it towards the driving organ (16), by the fact that 

each oscillating crosswise shaft (10a to 10e) has at one of its ends an 
interlocking device (34) destined to temporarily keep the position of one of 

the levers (18a to 18e) having been moved upward by the driving organ 
(16), and by the fact that the interlocking device (34) of each oscillating 

crosswise shaft (10a to 10e) is driven in phase with the motion of the first 
transportation organ (2). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the driving organ (16) driven in phase with the traveling motion of the rear 

edge (4b) of the lowermost plate-like matter being introduced consists of an 
endless belt (21) having a driving shoe (25) which acts successively on the 

end of each lever (18a to 18b) of the oscillating crosswise shafts (10a to 
10b) during the motion of the endless belt (21), the said levers (18a to 18b) 

being provided with pull-back means consisting of springs (15). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the driving organ (16) consists of cams (27a to 27e) acting successively on 

each lever (18a to 18e) of the oscillating crosswise shafts (10a to 10e). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the interlocking device (34) includes at least a clutch (36) rotarily locked in 

the course of the upward motion cycle of the mobile supporting organs (8) 
and released in the course of the downward motion cycle of the mobile 

supporting organs (8), the latter moving then simultaneously downward. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized by the fact that 
the downward motion cycle of the mobile supporting organs (8) is 

effectuated at the moment when the first organs (2) for transporting the 
plate-like matters (4a), which are driven with a sequential motion, are 

almost at zero speed.  
 
Device according to claim 5, characterized by the fact that 
the interlocking device (34) includes a unidirectional device (31) consisting 

of a free wheel fitted on each of the oscillating crosswise shafts (10a to 
10e) and associated with a gear-train (31, 32, 33) linking every oscillating 

crosswise shaft (10a to 10e).
