<DESCRIPTION>
 Micro echanical filter and method for the manufacture thereof.The invention relates to a micromechanical filter with a top layer provided with openings, a bottom layer, and an intermediate layer provided in predetermined first regions between the top layer and bottom layer, which intermediate layer substantially determines the spacing between the top layer and bottom layer in predetermined intermediate layer-free second regions, and a method for the manufacture of such a filter, in which the top layer and the bottom layer are joined together by means of the intermediate layer, first and second regions being formed by removal of parts of the intermediate layer.A filter of that kind is known from WO 89/08489. Here, the top layer and bottom layer have openings which are staggered relative to one another. These openings are joined to one another by intermediate layer-free second regions so that a fluid path from an opening in the top layer through the intermediate space between the top layer and the bottom layer to the opening in the bottom layer can be formed. The degree of permeability of the filter or the filter opening is in that case determined by the spacing between the top layer and the bottom layer. This spacing is in its turn determined by the thickness of the intermediate layer, which supports the top layer and the bottom layer against one another. The terms "top layer" and "bottom layer" serve here merely to differentiate two layers, they do not determine the orientation of the filter. 

 In the known filter, a relatively large pressure difference is necessary to propel the fluid through the filter. This leads to a correspondingly high pressure drop across the filter.The invention is based on the problem of providing a filter which creates a lower pressure drop during filtering.This problem is solved in a filter of the kind mentioned in the introduction by provision of third regions in which the spacing between the top layer and the bottom layer is greater than in the first and second regions.In the third regions the flow resistance for the fluid is therefore quite considerably reduced. The filtering effect is not impaired thereby, since the filtering characteristic is still determined by the second regions. Depending on the spacing of the top layer from the bottom layer in the second regions, this filter allows only corresponding particle sizes to pass through and holds others back. In the third regions there is admittedly a larger dead volume, but this is far more easily controllable than in
