<ABSTRACT>
The system for measuring the characteristic attitude angles of the 
wheels of an automobile frame comprises optical sensors positioned 

on the wheels of the automobile frame to feed data to a central 
processor arranged to convert them into angular values, and four 

identical measurement devices to be fixed in mutually symmetrical 
arrangement to the wheels of the automobile frame in such a manner 

as to interact with the devices positioned on the adjacent wheels, 
each device comprising two identical measurement units positioned 

in mutually perpendicular vertical planes and each comprising 
angle measurement means positioned vertically and horizontally, 

they having a single common reading unit, the angle measurement 
means comprising a light source directed towards a diaphragm, 

downstream of which there are located in succession a cylindrical 
converging lens and a reading unit consisting of CCD-type optical 

sensors perpendicular to the axis of the lens, downstream of which 
there is a container for liquid of high refractive power through 

which the light plane originating from the source is refracted 
onto the optical sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The correct geometrical configuration of a automobile frame
provided with wheels is achieved by measuring and correcting the
position of each wheel relative to the others, and relative to the
longitudinal and transverse axes of the frame.The whole of the angles defining the
wheel position is called the attitude
of the vehicle.Each wheel position is defined by a certain number of characteristic
angles well known to the expert of the art, which are measured in
known manner by goniometers or angle transducers fixed to a wheel
rim and interacting with analogous instruments fixed to the rims
of the two closest wheels in the transverse and longitudinal
directions.Interaction between said goniometers or angle transducers can be
achieved either mechanically by wires or springs, or by electrical
or optical means.GB-A-2258315 and EP-A-0460470 disclose systems for measuring
the characteristic attitude angles of the wheels of an automobile
frame comprising four identical measuring devices to be fixed on
the wheels, each comprising two identical measuring units positioned
in mutually perpendicular vertical planes. Among the most advanced of the known goniometers or angle
transducers are illustrated in U.S. patents 4341021 in the name of
BEISSBARTH and 4302104 in the name of HUNTER.The instruments described and illustrated in said patents are
intended to be applied in a total number of at least six to the
wheel rims of an automobile frame and to mutually cooperate to
identify the convergence angles of the wheels of an automobile
frame and the angles between those wheels on one and the same
side, deriving from the wheel track difference. By subjecting said angles to known calculation systems, the
characteristic attitude angles of the wheels can be obtained,
namely:
right, left and total front convergenceright, left and total rear convergencefront wheel misalignment front and rear wheel line of thrustconvergence angles to the thrust line and/or frame geometrical
axis.For better understanding, the aforesaid quantities are defined as
follows.The geometrical axis of the automobile frame is the axis passing
through the centre points of the frame front and rear axles.The frame thrust axis is the axis defined by the bisector of the
angle formed by extending the rear wheel equatorial planes.The front wheel misalignment is the angle between the straight
line joining the centres of the front wheels and a straight line
perpendicular to the geometrical axis.The front and rear total convergence is the angle formed between
the
