<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal device is constituted by a 
pair of oppositely disposed substrates having opposing 

inner surfaces and opposing electrodes thereon, and a 
chiral smectic liquid crystal disposed between the 

opposing electrodes. The liquid crystal device has an 
effective optical modulation region (2) and a peripheral 

region (3) outside the effective optical modulation 
region. In the device, liquid crystal molecules in 

the peripheral region have a pretilt angle (α₂) which is 
larger than a pretilt angle (α₁) of liquid crystal 

molecules in the effective optical modulation region. 
As a result, a local pressure irregularity or a 
cell 
thickness change caused by a liquid crystal molecular 

movement along an extension of the device is 
effectively suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal device which may be used as a display device
for a television receiver, a view finder for a video
camera or a terminal monitor for a computer, or a
light valve (optical shutter) for a liquid crystal
printer, a projector, etc.A liquid crystal display device of a passive
matrix drive-type using a TN (twisted nematic) liquid
crystal has been known as a device which can be
produced at a relatively low cost. The passive
matrix-drive type liquid crystal device using a TN-liquid
crystal has a certain limitation due to the
occurrence of a crosstalk or a lowering in contrast
along with the increase in number of drive lines so
that it cannot be said to be suitable as a display
device requiring a high resolution and a large number
of drive lines, e.g., a liquid crystal television
panel.As a type of liquid crystal device having
solved such a fundamental problem of a conventional
TN-liquid crystal device, there has been known a
ferroelectric liquid crystal device having
bistability. In the ferroelectric liquid crystal
device, a liquid crystal showing a chiral smectic 
phase, such as chiral smectic C (SmC*) phase or chiral
smectic H (SmH*) phase, in its operational state is
used. The liquid crystal tends to assume one of two
bistable states and does not readily assume an
intermediate molecular position. Further, this type
of liquid crystal quickly assumes one of the two
stable states in response to an electric field applied
thereto and retains the resultant state in the absence
of an electric field. By utilizing a chiral smectic
liquid crystal showing such properties to constitute a
liquid crystal device, it has become possible to
provide substantial improvements to the problems of a
conventional TN-liquid crystal device, inclusive of a
poor viewing angle characteristic.In this type of chiral smectic liquid crystal
device, however, there has been found a problem that
liquid crystal molecules can move in a direction
parallel to the substrate extension in some cases
under application of an electric field. As a result
of the movement, there is caused a phenomenon that the
cell thickness (spacing between a pair of substrates
sandwiching a liquid crystal material) is changed to
provide a pale yellow tint on a display picture (which
phenomenon may be referred to as "yellowing"). The
phenomenon is not desirable not only for a display
device but also for any other optical modulation
device as it causes a deterioration in optical 
performance.In order to suppress such a liquid
