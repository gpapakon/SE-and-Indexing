<ABSTRACT>
In a haymaking machine (M), especially a rotary windrower for rear mounting on a tractor, a supporting frame (T) can be connected to a holding device of the tractor (S) so as to be pivotable outwards laterally, the supporting frame (T) guiding the machine, having ground running wheels (13), on the machine mounting, there being provided in a region of articulation (G) provided between the machine mounting and the supporting frame (T) at least one axis of articulation transverse to the supporting frame (T) and approximately parallel to the ground, there are provided in the region of articulation (T) both a supporting-frame axis of articulation (18) and a machine-mounting axis of articulation (19) approximately parallel thereto and spaced therefrom, and the supporting frame (T, 8) is connected to the machine mounting (17) by means of an intermediate housing (Z) which is articulated, in each case pivotably, on the supporting-frame axis of articulation (18) for vertical movements of the machine (M) relative to the supporting frame (T, 8) and on the machine-mounting axis of articulation (19) for oscillating movements of the machine (M) about the machine-mounting axis of articulation (19) relative to the supporting frame (T, 8).

Hay-making machine, more especially a rotary-type
windrower for attachment to the rear of a tractor,

including a supporting frame (T, 8), which guides the
machine (M), having ground running wheels, on the machine

base (17) and is laterally outwardly pivotably connectable
to a means for supporting the tractor, and including a

pivotal region (G), which is provided between the machine
base (17) and the supporting frame (T, 8) and has at least

one machine base pivotal axis (19), which extends
transversely relative to the supporting frame (T, 8) and is

substantially parallel to the ground, characterised in that
a supporting frame pivotal axis (18), which is spaced from

the machine base pivotal axis (19), is provided in the
pivotal region (G), and in that the supporting frame (T, 8)

is connected to the machine base (17) by an intermediate
housing (Z) which is articulated to the supporting frame

pivotal axis (18) for vertical movements of the machine (M)
relative to the supporting frame (T, 8) and to the machine

base pivotal axis (19) for oscillatory movements of the
machine (M) about the machine base pivotal axis (19)

relative to the supporting frame (T, 8) - in a pivotable
manner in each case.
Hay-making machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that a selectively engageable and

disengageable locking device (20) is provided between the
supporting frame (T, 8) and the machine base (17), and the

machine base (17) is interlockable on the supporting frame
(T) by said device, preferably substantially parallel to

the supporting frame (T, 8).
Hay-making machine according to claim 2,
characterised in that the disengaged locking device (20)

forms a means for limiting the pivotal movement of the 
machine base (17) about the supporting frame pivotal axis

(18) and about the machine base pivotal axis (19).
Hay-making machine according to at least one of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the machine frame

pivotal axis (19) - when viewed with respect to the
position of the machine frame (17) parallel to the

supporting frame (T, 8) - is orientated in a plane parallel
to the supporting frame pivotal axis (18) and at an acute

angle (α) relative to the supporting frame pivotal axis
(18) in such a manner that, when the supporting frame (T,

8) has been laterally outwardly pivoted at an angle (α) of
less than 90° (90° - α), the machine base pivotal axis (19)

lies parallel to the direction of travel.
Hay-making machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that a limit stop (A) for the pivotal

movement of the intermediate housing (Z) is provided on the
intermediate housing (Z) and/or on the supporting frame (T,

8), the intermediate housing (Z) being clampable to the
supporting frame (T, 8) by said movement in the downward

direction about the supporting frame pivotal axis (18).
Hay-making machine according to claim 2,
characterised in that the locking device (20) includes a

bar (29), which is pivotable in the machine base (17) about
an axis (26), which is parallel to the supporting frame

pivotal axis (18), between a locking position I and an idle
position II, and in that a bar receiver (34) is provided on

the supporting frame (T), the bar (29) being engageable
with said receiver in the locking position I when the

intermediate housing (Z) is clamped to the limit stop (A).
Hay-making machine according to claims 2, 3 and 6,
characterised in that, in the upward pivotal direction of

the machine base (17), the axis (26) of the bar (29) about 
the supporting frame pivotal axis (18) is orientated

towards an abutment (W) on the supporting frame (T).
Hay-making machine according to claims 6 and 7,
characterised in that the bar receiver (34) is configured

simultaneously as the abutment (W) for the axis (26).
Hay-making machine according to claim 6,
characterised in that the bar (29) comprises a shaft (40),

which forms the axis (26), and a locking pin (41), which is
parallel to the shaft (40) and is retained on the shaft

(40) by means of arms (30), and in that a spring (27),
which urges the locking pin (41) via a dead centre into the

locking position and into the idle position respectively of
