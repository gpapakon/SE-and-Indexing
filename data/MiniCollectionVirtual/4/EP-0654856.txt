<ABSTRACT>
To judge with certainty whether the condition of 
attachment of each metal terminal is proper, a method and 

apparatus are provided in which a thinned distal end 
portion of a lance check pin having guide portions 

contacts an inner surface of a lance flexing space. The 
lance check pin, when inserted into the lance flexing 

space, is kept in a proper posture by the guide portions. 
Therefore, misjudgment of the terminal position is 

avoided. In addition, to eliminate the need for a 
retainer, there is provided a method and apparatus in 

which metal terminal-inserting jigs are inserted into a 
connector, so that pressing portions of the jigs are 

inserted into cavities through insertion holes of a 
connector housing. Metal terminals disposed in an 

improperly-inserted position are pushed by distal ends of 
pressing portions of the jig, and are moved to a properly-inserted 

position where the metal terminal is held against 
withdrawal by the engagement portion of a lance. The jigs 

are reusable, thereby reducing the number of the parts. 
Even if the metal terminal is disposed in an improperly-inserted 

position, the metal terminal need not be removed 
reinserted, and reinspected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector examination
device and method for detecting improper attachment of a
metal terminal inserted in a connector housing.Generally, a connector comprises a connector
housing of a plastics material in which metal terminals,
each fixedly secured to one end of a wire, are mounted,
and each metal terminal is retained against withdrawal by
a lance (elastic retaining pawl) formed integrally within
the connector housing. When the metal terminal is
inserted into the connector housing, the lance is flexed
downwardly toward a flexing space until the metal terminal
is inserted into a proper position, at which point the
lance is elastically restored to engage a void formed
along a bottom surface of the metal terminal, thereby
preventing withdrawal of the metal terminal.With this type of terminal withdrawal prevention
construction, a certain degree of a frictional force acts
between the metal terminal and the lance when the metal
terminal is inserted. The frictional force is of such a
degree that the metal terminal cannot be inserted into the
housing any further, which may give the impression to an
operator that the terminal is reliably secured by the
lance, even though it is not properly inserted into the
housing. Accordingly, the operator, engaged in the
inserting operation, may misunderstand that complete
insertion has been achieved, and may stop the inserting
operation before the lance actually engages the terminal.However, if the metal terminal is not completely
inserted into the proper position where the metal terminal
engages the lance in the connector housing, the metal
terminal can become withdrawn from the housing during use. 
Therefore it is necessary to preliminarily inspect the
terminal connections to correct any improperly inserted or
incompletely connected terminals.Recently, various kinds of connector examination
devices have been developed for detecting improper
attachment of a metal terminal. The present applicant
filed an application (Japanese Patent Application No. 5-281716)
shown in Fig. 7. In this construction, a lance
check pin 51 is provided in a projected manner in opposed
relation to each lance 61 in a connector 60, and the lance
check pin 51 is adapted to be inserted into a lance
flexing space 63 formed in a connector housing 62. When a
metal terminal 65 is completely inserted into a proper
position, the lance check pin 51, inserted in the lance
flexing space 63, does not strike against the lance 61,
but is brought into underlying relation with the lance,
