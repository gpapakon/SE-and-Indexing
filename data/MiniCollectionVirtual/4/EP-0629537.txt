<ABSTRACT>
Swing out sliding wall (11) for freight wagons with lower and upper displacement device, which has a large degree of freedon of manoeuvre of the upper displacement device and in which high-speed bogies can be used while maintaining a floor level of 1250 mm, the lever (13) of the upper displacement device being provided with a guide arm (15) at whose end a guide roller (8) is arranged and the angle between the lever (13) and guide arm (15) being determined by a stop (7) and the guide roller (8) engaging in a guide rail (16) of the swing-out sliding wall (11) and a securing bracket (17) with spacing roller (19) engaging, with spacing, in a cavity of the wall lying below the swing-out sliding wall (11) as it passes over the non-opened swing-out sliding wall (11). The lower displacement device has a support roller (9) which, in the closed position of the swing-out sliding wall (11) rests on the block (10) which is constructed with an oblique support. A fork (3) which is permanently attached to the lower actuation shaft engages with the open end of the fork into a pin (4) of the roller foot (18) and thus moves the running roller (5) on a curved path which is only flat. The invention can be installed in highly restricted cavities of external longitudinal carriers, and the closing mechanism functions with little application force and without additional spring forces in order to draw the swing-out sliding wall (11) into the sealing frames.

<CLAIMS>
Freight wagon having a swinging-sliding wall 
provided with an upper and a lower swing-out device which 

are connected to one another by means of connecting and 
actuating mechanisms, the upper swing-out device being 

provided with a lever and a spacer and also with guide 
and locking devices and the lower swing-out device 

consisting of a roller foot comprising a running roller 
and support elements, said running roller being levered 

by means of a lever system onto a running rail provided 
along the wagon and the roller foot resting, in the 

closed position of the swinging-sliding wall, by a 
support on a rest arranged in the longitudinal beam, 

characterized in that the lever (13), fixed on the 
actuating shaft (1), of the upper swing-out device is 

connected by means of a joint (14) to a guide arm (15) on 
whose end is provided a guide roller (8) held by a guide 

rail (16) which is fixed on the swinging-sliding wall 
(11), extends over the entire length of the 

swinging-sliding wall (11) and is open at the bottom and 
which forms a part of the extruded section of the 

swinging-sliding wall, and in that between the lever (13) 
and the guide arm (15) a stop (7) limiting the turning 

angle is provided, and the lower swing-out device has, at 
the end of the roller foot (18), near the running roller 

(5) a support roller (9) which lies on the rest (10) 
which is formed with an inclined support surface, and in 

that the fork (3) fixed on the lower actuating shaft (2) 
engages by its open end a pin (4) of the roller foot 

(18), and the roller (5) of the roller foot (18) rests on  
 

the continuous running rail (6) and at the same time the 
axle of the running roller (5) passes through a flat 

curved path, the pin (4) lying in the fork end and 
transmitting vertical forces only during the lifting-off 

from the rest (10) and only until the roller (5) is 
supported on the running rail (6). 
Freight wagon according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the actuating shafts (1 and 2) are connected by 

a drive which has a transmission ratio turning the 
actuating shaft (1) at a lower speed. 
Freight wagon according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that interruptions are provided in the running rail 

(6) in order to swivel away the forks (3) on the lower 
flange of the outer longitudinal beam (12). 
Freight wagon according to Claims 1 and 3, 
characterized in that in the central region of the 

sliding-wall wagon, in order to bridge over the interruptions 
in the running rail (6), running rollers rigidly 

connected to one another are provided on the roller foot 
(18) of the swinging-sliding wall (11).
