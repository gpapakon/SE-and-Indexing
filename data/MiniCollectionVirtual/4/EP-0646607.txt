<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to block copolymers of monovinylarenes
and conjugated dienes and methods of preparation of these block
copolymers.There has developed in the polymer field, and especially in
the packaging and related industries, a need for thermoplastic polymers
that can be formed into odorless, colorless, transparent articles having
good impact strength and ductility. There are needs for polymers which
are useful as single components as well as for use in blends with other
commonly used polymers to make articles with improved properties. The
polymers satisfying these needs should be suitable for use with
conventional extrusion, injection and blow molding equipment and also
suitable for use in other methods of forming plastics into containers,
tubes, films, fibers, and the like. Much effort has been directed to the preparation of
substantially transparent block copolymer resins with a variety of block
structures produced by a variety of monomer addition sequences and a
variety of coupling agents. Desirable properties and an economic
advantage can be obtained by blending many monovinylarene-conjugated
diene copolymers with polystyrene polymers. However, because blends of
monovinylarene-conjugated diene copolymers with polystyrene polymers
often contain unreacted styrene monomer, there is a need for high
styrene content thermoplastic polymers which do not have undesirable
unreacted styrene monomer while maintaining a good balance of physical
and mechanical properties.Odor caused by presence of unreacted styrene monomer in
articles formed from various copolymers and blends of copolymers with
polystyrene is a long-standing problem in applications where odorless,
colorless materials which also have good impact strength and ductility
are desirable. Specific examples include materials for water and food
containers.It is an object of this invention to provide novel resinous
block copolymers of monovinylarene hydrocarbons and conjugated dienes
from which can be made transparent articles with an advantageous balance
of properties including acceptable impact strength and ductility.It is another object of this invention to provide novel
resinous block copolymers of monovinylarene hydrocarbons and conjugated
dienes suitable for use as a replacement for blends of
monovinylarene-conjugated diene copolymers with polymers of styrene. 
Further, it is an object to provide high styrene content resinous block
copolymers of monovinylarene hydrocarbons and conjugated dienes which
can be used for applications requiring
