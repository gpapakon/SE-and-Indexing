<ABSTRACT>
In order to decontaminate solid materials contaminated with organic pollutants, in particular soil contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the materials are mixed with a micro-emulsion, if required after being crushed and mechanically disaggregated. The organic impurities are solubilized in the apolar compartment of the micro-emulsion and the micro-emulsion is decomposed, in particular by temperature change, into a tenside-rich phase and into a pollutant-containing phase. By using micro-emulsions of biodegradable components, the purified solid materials, in particular purified soil, may be returned to the environment. A plant for carrying out the process has a multiple-stage extraction device (3), in which the contaminated solid material is mixed with the micro-emulsion and the impurities concentrate in the apolar oil phase. In a separating device (6), the extracted solid material is separated from the contaminated micro-emulsion, which is then decomposed in a phase separating device (8) into a tenside-rich water phase, collected in the container (11), and into a pollutant-containing oil phase (oil container 12). By using biodegradable components for the micro-emulsion, the pollutant-containing oil phase can be reacted in a micro-organism reactor (14) in order to achieve its total degradation.

<CLAIMS>
Process for decontaminating solid materials
contaminated with organic pollutants,

characterised in that in the case of solid materials
containing or consisting of fine grain having grain

sizes up to 0.063 mm, the organic pollutants are
extracted from the fine grain by means of a micro-emulsion

and the micro-emulsion thereby formed,
containing the pollutants, is separated from the

purified solid material.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that the micro-emulsion is converted
into a surfactant-rich and a pollutant-containing

phase.
Process according to claim 2,

characterised in that the surfactant-rich phase of
the micro-emulsion is recycled for extracting the

contaminated solid material.
Process according to any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that the micro-emulsion consists of
biologically degradable components.
Process according to claim 4,

characterised in that the pollutant-containing phase
is infiltrated with micro-organisms to break down the

organic compounds and that pollutant-free water
produced thereby is drawn off.
Process according to claim 5,

characterised in that micro-organisms are used that
are suitable and adapted for inoculating the purified

solid material. 
Process according to any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that the purified solid material -
after removal of the micro-emulsion containing the

pollutants - is rinsed with water, and if
biologically degradable components are being used the

rinsing solution is passed to the pollutant-containing
phase infiltrated with micro-organisms.
Process according to claim 7,

characterised in that after it has been rinsed with
water, the purified solid material is removed and

inoculated with the adapted micro-organisms utilised
for the biological degradation of the pollutant-containing

phase.
