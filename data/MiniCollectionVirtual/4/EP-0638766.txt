<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for lighting optical fibers as well 
as surrounding regions includes a generally vertically oriented 

housing (11) including a light source (17) 
positioned near the upper end (15) of 

the housing (11) for directing radiant flux toward the ends of a 
plurality of optical fibers (35) and for reflecting remaining portions 

of the radiant flux from the light source (17) in a lateral direction 
into the surrounding regions. A light reflector (19) is positioned in 

the housing (11) for laterally reflecting a portion of the radiant 
flux, and includes a central aperture (21) in the reflector to pass 

the central portion of the radiant flux therethrough to the ends 
of the optical fibers (35). The same reflector (19) serves as a baffle on 

the lower side thereof to deflect moving air within the housing (11) 
around the ends of the optical fibers (35) and through the aperture (21) 

in 
the reflector (19) toward the light source (17). A fan (37) disposed 

below the 
baffle (19) in the housing (11) moves ambient air through an 

opening in the 
lower portion (13) of the housing (11) and around the ends of the optical 

fibers (35) and through the aperture (21) in the reflector (19) toward 
the light 

source (17) for venting thereafter through the upper portion (41) of the 
housing. The reflector and baffle (19) also supports the optical 

fibers (35) in alignment with the central portion of the radiant flux 
from the light source (17) through the aperture (21) in the reflector 

(19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to light sources for optical fibers 
and more particularly to light sources for exterior installation 
to provide aesthetically-pleasing area lighting as well as to 
supply high-intensity light flux to optical fibers. Optical fibers are commonly used to provide aesthetically-pleasing 
lighting effects to highlight features and borders of 
buildings, landscapes, swimming pools, and the like. These 
exterior lighting installations typically require waterproof 
light sources that must be located close to the features or 
borders that are to be highlighted by light emitted from the 
optical fibers in order to preserve high intensity illumination 
over the length of the optical fibers. Lighting of this type 
commonly relies upon plastic optical fibers for low cost, 
flexibility, and immunity from weather conditions, but such 
fibers require significant cooling at the input ends in order to 
avoid melting and deterioration attributable to high-intensity 
light sources operated in close proximity to the fibers. Certain 
known light sources for exterior installations to provide light 
flux to optical fibers rely upon a pair of windows that are 
interposed between fiber ends and light source and that are  
 
spaced apart along the direction of illumination supplied to the 
ends of optical fibers in order to pass cooling air between the 
spaced windows (See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,763,984). Another example is for instance given in WO-A-9 111 743 in which radiators are added to the light guide coupler to improve heat dissipation. 
One disadvantage of light sources of this type is that the 
composite unit is unsightly and typically must be installed at 
substantial distance away from the features or borders that are 
to be lighted by the optical fibers which are illuminated by such 
light source. In accordance with the present invention, a 'bollard'-style 
lighting fixture is arranged in substantially vertical 
orientation for installation in a region or locale that is to be 
generally illuminated and that is close to the features or 
borders which are to be illuminated by optical fibers that 
receive light flux from such lighting fixture. A high-intensity 
light source is disposed near the upper end of the fixture to 
direct illumination downward toward a baffle and reflector 
structure which includes a central aperture that aligns with the 
ends of a plurality of optical fibers. A central portion of the 
light flux from the light source is oriented to pass through the 
central
