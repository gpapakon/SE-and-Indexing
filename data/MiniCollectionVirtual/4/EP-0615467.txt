<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the use of 2-mercaptobenzoxazole 
derivatives as collectors for the selective 
flotation of metal ores, as well as the related 
flotation process. More particularly, this invention 
relates to the selective flotation of those ores which 
are substantially in form of sulphides, to separate 
materials containing copper, zinc and silver. As known in the art, flotation techniques use the 
selective activity of some special reagents on the 
various mineral components in order to separate one of 
said components or to provide an enrichment of the 
product in one of such components. The reagents 
employed for this purpose are commonly referred to as 
flotation "collectors", or "collecting agents" (or 
"collection agents"). The known or used collectors of the existing art are 
classified in two main classes, depending upon their 
ionic or nonionic nature. The use of non-ionic oily or 
neutral collectors is generally restricted to the 
flotation of non polar minerals, whilst the ionic 
collectors are used for all the other ore types. The 
ionic collectors are absorbed on the ore surface 
through an essentially chemical bond.  
 The conventional collectors suitable for the sulphide 
mineral flotation are mercaptan-based (i.e. thiol type) 
compounds and, among them, xanthates are the most 
widespread. However, such agents are effective on the 
whole sulphide class, without showing any specific 
selectivity within the said class. While in most cases this property does not involve any 
problem, in some specific cases the composition of the 
ore to be treated is such that the use of modifying 
compounds is needed to make the collecting activity 
more specific. Actually, the ore could contain a number of different 
commercially valuable sulphides forming an intimate 
admixture with each other and with the gangue, and each 
one of said sulphides could be present in such amount 
as to justify its recovery. For example, this occurs 
with complex sulphide ores consisting of intimate 
associations of chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂), sphalerite (ZnS) 
and galena (PbS) into a pyrite matrix, which 
associations could also contain a valuable amount of 
silver and, in some cases, of gold. The use of modifiers often causes strong problems 
without giving the desired results, particularly when 
treating ores of a complex composition, whose surface 
features are not sufficiently defined. It is clear from the foregoing that the use of 
collectors capable of bonding given sulphides in a  
 
selective way with respect
