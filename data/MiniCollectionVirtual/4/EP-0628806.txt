<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and system for quantitatively 
evaluating photolithographic masks. More particularly it relates 
to a system which can produce data concerning phase shift and 
chrome masks and their defects and can provide optical images 
useful for evaluating the mask and defects by quantitatively 
analyzing the data produced. The production of microelectronic circuits with features of 
smaller size requires the ability to create images of 
correspondingly smaller size. As a practical matter, optical 
imaging systems using light in the visual range have a resolution 
limit of approximately 1 micron. One way in which to produce higher resolution images is to 
decrease the wavelength of the energy used to expose the 
photoresist material that is then developed to produce the image. 
Energy in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum 
will not pass through ordinary optical elements. Thus it is 
required that lenses and masks be fabricated from materials such 
as quartz which readily transmit ultraviolet light. An extremely promising new technology for producing high 
resolution images requires the use of so called "phase shift 
masks". Typically, these masks image "light" or electromagnetic 
energy in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. By changing the "optical thickness" of the mask in predetermined 
patterns, advantageous optical interference effects as produced  
 
which may enhance resolution, depth of focus and contrast. Thus, 
the desired features are projected on to the photoresist. However, 
if there are errors in the phase shift produced when light travels 
through the mask, the image produced on the photoresist will be 
inaccurate or distorted and the advantages noted above will not be 
realized. One prior art method for evaluating the effectiveness of phase 
shift masks is a functional test. The mask is placed in an optical 
stepper and used to expose photoresist. The images produced are 
evaluated to determine whether the mask is suitable for producing 
the features intended. The difficulty with this functional test is 
that it is costly, time consuming and does not provide detailed 
information on the nature of the errors in the mask which 
contribute to the unacceptable image being formed. Another technique for evaluating phase shift masks is to 
physically measure the depth of etch or of the various layers on 
the mask. While this may ascertain the accuracy of the actual 
physical dimensions, there is no assurance that the mask will 
perform optically
