<ABSTRACT>
Pyrotechnic composition intended for the production of delay fuses, of the type consisting of a powder mixture of tungsten, barium chromate and potassium perchlorate, characterised in that it contains an ultrafine silica powder whose particles have a mean diameter of between 7 and 40 millimicrons, according to a mass percentage of the order of 0.5 to 1.5 %, to produce a coating of the powder particles.

<CLAIMS>
An application of a pyrotechnic composition 
formed of a mixture of tungsten powder, barium chromate 

and potassium chlorate in the manufacture of a delay cord 
of small outer diametre, notably less than 4 mm, a cord 

which comprises a sheath containing the pyrotechnic 
composition, an application 
characterised in that
 the 
pyrotechnic composition also comprises an ultrafine silica 

powder whose particles have an average diametre of between 
7 and 40 nm, according to a percentage in the aggregate of 

around 0.5 to 1.5%, to form a coating for the powder 
particles, so as to avoid any risk of the sheath bursting 

and the interruption of combustion. 
An application according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the silica particles have an average 

diametre of 16 nm. 
An application according to one of Claims 1 or 
2, characterised in that the pyrotechnic composition 

comprises a part of silica in the aggregate in a mixture 
enclosing in the aggregate 33% tungsten, 60% barium 

chromate and 7% potassium perchlorate. 
An application according to one of Claims 1 and 
2, characterised in that the pyrotechnic composition 

comprises a part of silica in the aggregate in a mixture 
enclosing in the aggregate 32% tungsten, 58% barium 

chromate and 10% potassium perchlorate.
