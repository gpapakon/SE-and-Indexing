<ABSTRACT>
The present invention contemplates a mechanically 
simply constructed mechanism located internally of a 

piston engine for adjustably changing the stroke of a 
piston (22) over a predetermined range in response to a 

variety of operating control parameters. The adjustable 
stroke changing mechanism provides an optimum compression 

ratio at each change in piston stroke and over the entire 
range of piston stroke provided which may be varied from 

one piston engine to another of different performance 
characteristics without requiring a major change in design 

of the stroke changing mechanism. The stroke changing 
mechanism includes a swing plate (34) pivotally fixed to 

the engine block (14) at one end and placed intermediate 
the piston connection rod (28) and respective crankshaft 

pin at its other end, each of which are affixed to and 
translate within the swing plate as the piston (22) is 

driven to reciprocate within a piston cylinder (12). An 
adjustment link (50) is pivotally connected to the engine 

block (14) at one end and to the connecting rod (28) at 
its other end and at the swing plate (34). The adjustment 

link (50) is hydraulically controlled and actuable to vary 
in length and thereby change the stroke, and concurrently 

the compression ratio of the piston (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to piston engines and 
apparatus for automatically varying piston stroke and 
compression ratio, and is particularly related to internal 
combustion engines including apparatus for automatically 
varying the stroke of the piston during operation of the 
engine responsive to changes in operating conditions or 
performance demands. The conventional reciprocating piston-type internal 
combustion engine commonly used in automotive vehicles can 
be significantly improved if part load throttling and 
friction losses are reduced. In other words, conventional 
engines of this type are designed such to give optimum 
performance at full load, wide open throttle. At less 
than wide open throttle, and particularly at the lower 
speeds, the fuel in the combustion chamber of any fixed 
stroke engine will be less dense. Consequently, its 
burning efficiency will be reduced. Further, the friction 
losses in a reciprocating piston-type engine remain 
relatively constant regardless of speed. Consequently, at 
the lower speeds, the friction losses are a greater 
proportion of the work being expended to require the 
performance output. Lower throttling and friction losses 
will provide reduced fuel consumption, i.e. greater fuel 
efficiency. Further, the resulting improvement in fuel 
efficiency can be additionally enhanced by concurrent 
optimisation of the compression ratio for each engine 
displacement. Variable stroke piston engines are known, such as 
shown for example in the following U.S. patents:
 
1,112,832; 1,189,312; 1,372,644; 2,653,484; 2,873,611; 
2,909,163; 4,131,094; and 4,538,557.  In certain of the systems, for example, as shown in 
U.S. Patent No. 2,909,163, an articulated linkage is 
provided between the crankshaft pin and the piston 
connecting rod that allows for varying the piston stroke 
while maintaining a constant piston clearance with the 
cylinder head (as is useful in compressor applications), 
or varying the piston clearance with each change in piston 
stroke. Adjustment of the stroke is effected manually on 
the exterior of the engine block or frame. Manual adjustment is common to the remaining 
aforementioned patents with the exception of U.S. Patent 
No. 4,131,094 wherein there is shown a system for 
automatically adjusting the piston stroke in accordance 
with different density of the fuel-air charges to be 
inducted into the combustion chamber. The present invention contemplates a mechanically 
simply constructed mechanism located internally of a 
piston engine for
