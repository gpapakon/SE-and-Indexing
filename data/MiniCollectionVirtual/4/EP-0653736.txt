<ABSTRACT>
A method for disseminating modifications to a database stored 
in a plurality of receivers, comprising the steps of:

 
transmitting a mask code and mask data; storing in said receivers 

a mask indicating positions in said database where said mask data 
is to be written; examining a received message to detect said mask 

code; and writing, in response to said mask code, said mask data at 
said positions indicated by said mask.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent 
application serial number 07/050,826, filed May 15, 1987, 
the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Paging systems, which come in various levels 
of sophistication, have certain features in common. 
Individual subscribers to a paging system have pagers 
for receiving the paging system broadcasts. Each pager 
has an individual ID, called the capcode, stored in the 
pager. All the pagers in an area monitor broadcast 
messages from a central transmitter. Each message is 
intended for a particular pager and has that pager's 
capcode associated with the message. Thus, pagers in 
an area all monitor a certain frequency for broadcasts 
from the pager system transmitter looking for its capcode. 
When the capcode is present, that is when the 
capcode is broadcast by the transmitter, the message 
associated with the capcode, which typically follows 
the capcode, is acted upon by the pager. The most basic type of pager is called a 
beeper. The message is simply an instruction to actuate 
the pager causing it to emit the familiar beep, 
illuminate an LED, or both. Another type of pager system 
is used to transmit numeric messages, typically a 
telephone number the recipient is to call. When the 
individual pager receives that pager's capcode, the 
accompanying message is typically stored in a read/write 
memory in the pager and displayed (then or later) on 
the pager's numeric display. More recently alphanumeric 
pagers have been introduced. The messages associated 
with these pager systems include both number and word  
 
messages which are received and stored by the recipient 
pager for display immediately or later. One pager, called the PMR 2000 and made by 
Motorola of Shaumburg,Illinois is used for both individual 
messages, those directed to an individual pager, and 
group messages, those directed to a group of pagers. 
This type of pager can have one or more capcodes stored 
in the pager at the time of manufacture or stored in 
the pager by the local pager company. One capcode is 
the pager's individual ID while any other would be a 
group ID since more than on pager would have it. There are several standard formats for paging 
broadcast. One format is called POCSAG. With this 
format any length message is possible. Many pager manufacturers 
have chosen this format because of its flexibility. 
Pagers using the POCSAG format "listen" for a 
broadcast from the pager transmitter for 40 msec out of 
each second. If the transmitter is not active usually

<CLAIMS>
A method for disseminating modifications to a database 
stored in a plurality of receivers, comprising the 

steps of: 
transmitting a mask code and mask data; 

storing in said receivers a mask indicating positions 
in said database where said mask data is to be 

written; 
examining a received message to detect said mask code; 

and 
writing, in response to said mask code, said mask data 

at said positions indicated by said mask. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of: 
transmitting said mask to said receivers; and 

receiving and storing, in said receivers, said mask. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of: 
storing a plurality of masks in said receivers, each 

mask having a corresponding mask ID; 
transmitting a mask ID with said mask data;

 
comparing a received mask ID with the mask IDs stored 

in said receiver; and 
if said received mask ID matches a stored mask ID, 

retrieving a mask corresponding to said mask ID and 
writing said mask data at said positions in said 

database indicated by said mask. 
A method for disseminating modifications to a database 
stored in a plurality of receivers, comprising the 

steps of: 
transmitting a mask code, mask ID and mask data; 

storing in said receivers a plurality of masks and 
mask IDs, each mask ID corresponding to a different 

one of said masks, each mask indicating positions in 
said database where said mask data is to be written; 

examining a received message for said mask code; 
comparing, in response to detecting aid mask code, a 

received mask ID to said stored mask IDs; 
if said received mask ID matches a stored mask ID, 

retrieving a mask corresponding to said mask ID; and 
writing aid mask data at positions in said database 

indicated by said retrieved mask. 
The method of claim 4 further comprising the steps of: 
transmitting at least one of said masks and mask ID; 

and
 

receiving and storing in said receivers said 
transmitted mask and mask ID. 
The method of claim 4 further comprising the steps of: 
transmitting an indication of a number of blocks of 

data, for said retieved mask; and 
repeatedly using said retrieved mask in said 

receivers to write different portions of said mask 
data on different pages of said database as indicated 

by said indication. 
The method of claim 6 further comprising the steps of: 
transmitting a number of pages to be skipped after 

each use of said retrieved mask; and 
skipping, in said receivers, said number of pages 

after each write of mask data using said retrieved 
mask.
