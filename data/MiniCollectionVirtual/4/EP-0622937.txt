<ABSTRACT>
From time-to-time, the telephone outside loop plant is severely damaged 
as a result of some catastrophe, such as a hurricane. To facilitate the repair and 

identification of such damage, a facility is provided which rapidly assesses and 
outputs to a terminal the extent of such damage. The rapid assessment is made 

possible by taking advantage of information that may be obtained from a number of 
different sources, in which the extent of the damage may be determined from such 

information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to monitoring and quickly assessing damage to the 
telephone outside loop plant. Local exchange telephone companies monitor the status of a number of 
different types of elements forming their networks. These network elements include 
central office switching and transmission equipment. The transmission equipment 
includes outside plant facilities comprising various cables of telephone lines (outside 
loop plant) which, for the most part, connect the central office to the premises of 
telephone subscribers. The outside loop plant is tested periodically typically using a so-called 
Automatic Line Insulation Test (ALIT). Since such tests are intrusive (service 
affecting), they are performed on idle telephone lines only, and at a time when most 
telephone lines are idle, i.e., during the middle of the night. One aspect of such 
testing is that a considerable amount of time is used to attach the test equipment to a 
loop. As such, only a few thousand idle telephone lines (loops) can be tested per 
hour. In a large central office switch, it may take several nights to test all of the 
loops originating from that switch. If a catastrophe occurs, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, flood, 
etc, the telephone company may use particular test equipment to assess the status of 
central office equipment and interoffice transmission facilities. However, if the 
catastrophe also causes extensive damage to the outside loop plant, then the 
telephone company has no way to rapidly assess and report the extent of that 
damage. In such an instance, the telephone company may either wait for the results 
of the nightly ALIT tests or wait for subscribers to call the telephone company and 
report problems. In the first few hours after a catastrophe, it is advantageous for a local 
telephone company to quickly locate and assess outside loop plant damage for a 
number of reasons including, (a) coordination and dispatch of repair crews and (b) 
publicly reporting via public media (e.g., radio and/or television) the extent of the 
damage and the time it will take to repair such damage. Currently, an electric utility company monitors its facilities to quickly 
identify damaged equipment and/or power lines. If the damage is extensive, then the 
utility company publicly announces the extent of the damage to assure the public  
 
that the utility is aware of the damage and is making repairs. The invention as set forth in claim 1. In the FIGs.:

<CLAIMS>
A method of assessing the level of damage done to at least one outside 
loop plant cable, said cable comprising a plurality of pairs of wires, individual ones 

of said pairs of wires forming respective local loop pairs associated with respective 
telephone station sets, said method CHARACTERIZED BY the steps of 

   associating individual ones of said pairs of wires with a status of 
working or damaged based on information identifying individual ones of said station 

sets that are either out of service or in a permanently off-hook state as a result of said 
damage and based on calling information identifying telephone calls successfully 

placed to and from respective ones of said telephone station sets, and 
   performing transmission tests on selected ones of said pairs of wires 

whose status cannot be determined from said identifying and calling information as a 
way of determining such status. 
The method set forth in claim 1 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN 

THAT said outside loop plant includes a plurality of cables, and wherein individual 
ones of said outside loop plant cables are associated with respective telephone 

switches, and wherein said method is FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY the step 
of logically partitioning said outside loop plant cables into respective outside loop 

subplants to facilitate said assessment. 
The method set forth in claim 1 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY 
the step of directing said switches to accumulate said calling information relating to 

their associated outside loop subplants. 
The method set forth in claim 1 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY 
the steps of 

   outputting the level of damage to said at least one cable to an output 
terminal and generating a level of confidence in the status of the pairs of wires 

forming said at least one cable, and 
   outputting said level of confidence to said terminal. 
The method set forth in claim 1 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN 
THAT said step of outputting includes the step of generating a level of confidence in 

the status of the pairs of wires forming said at least one cable and continuing said 
step of directing if said level does not meet a predetermined threshold. 
The method set forth in claim 2 FURTHER CHARACTERIZED IN 
THAT said step of directing includes the steps of 


(a) for each of said plurality of cables, if only i pairs of wires have a 
known status then performing said transmission test on one of those pairs of wires 

having an unknown status, where the initial value of i=0, and 
(b) incrementing i and repeating step (a) if the value of i has not 
reached a predetermined value.
