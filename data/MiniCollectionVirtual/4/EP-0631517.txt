<ABSTRACT>
A cross-country ski, in particular for the so-called "skating step" technique, wherein its supporting length (LP) corresponding to the length of the base between the two forward (5) and rear (6) contact lines of the ski is no greater than 1430 mm. The change in the camber (C 
&
cir
&
 _) of the central ski portion intermediate said lines when a load of 40 kg is applied at the mid-point of said supporting length (LP) while the ski is resting on two spaced bearings (7, 8) separated by a distance (L 
&
cir
&
 _) determined by dividing the supporting length (LP) by a constant coefficient of 2,78, said bearings (7, 8) being centered relative to said mid-point of the supporting length, is at most 2 mm, said change in camber being defined relative to the ski camber when no load is applied, which camber is measured relative to a plane (P 
&
cir
&
 _) containing both bearings (7, 8).

Cross-country ski, more particularly intended for the 
technique termed "skating", characterized : 


in that its bearing length L
P
, corresponding to the 
developed length of the sole separating the two respective 

front (5) and rear (6) contact lines of the ski is at most 
equal to 1 430 mm, 
and in that the variation in the deflexion 
C
 at the 
support face under a load of 40 kilograms exerted at the 

mid-point of said bearing length L
P
, when the ski is 
placed on two supports (7,8) which are separated from each 

other by a length 
L
 defined as being equal to the ratio of 
the bearing length L
P
 to a constant coefficient equal to 
2.78, said supports (7,8) being centred with respect to the 

mid-point of the bearing length, is at most equal to two 
millimetres, this variation in the deflexion being defined 

with respect to the deflexion of the ski in the absence of 
load, itself measured with respect to the plane 
P
 passing 
through the two support points (7,8). 
Cross-country ski according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the ratio of the variation in the deflexion 
C
 to 
the bearing length L
P
 is at most equal to 0.17%. 
Cross-country ski according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that its flattening force F
MP
, that is to 
say the force exerted at said mid-point of the bearing 

length L
P
 of the ski resting on a plane surface 
P'
 
incorporating its two respective front (5) and rear (6) 

contact lines, necessary to achieve deflexion of 0.3 mm, is 
at least equal to 400 newtons. 
Cross-country ski according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the minimum thickness of the support 

face (4) at its thickest point is 23 millimetres 
Cross-country ski according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the ratio of the thickness of the 

support face (4) at its thickest point to the bearing 
length L
P
 is at least equal to 1.7%.  
 
Cross-country ski according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that its developed and projected surface 

is broken down into five essential regions, namely from the 
heel to the tip : 


a first region (9), of short length, extending from 
the rear end 
O
 of the heel, in which the width increases as 
far as the vicinity of the rear contact line (6), thus 

defining a trapezoidal surface ; 
a second region (10), contiguous to the first region 
(9) and extending substantially as far as the vicinity of 

the support face (4), having a constant width and thus 
defining a rectangular surface ; 
a third region (11) extending from the support face 
(4) to the widest point PI of the ski, in which the width 

also increases, and defining a trapezoidal surface ; 
a fourth region (13) extending between the PI and the 
front contact line (5), and in which the width decreases, 

defining a substantially trapezoidal surface ; 
and finally a fifth region (12) extending from the 
front contact line (5) to the front end of the ski, having 

a width which decreases to a zero value, defining the tip 
proper (2).
