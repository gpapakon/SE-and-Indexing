<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head position control apparatus for 
driving the magnetic head (2) of a disc recording apparatus 

toward or away from the recording surface of a magneto-optical 
disc (5) to effect position control of the magnetic 

head. Changes in the distance between the magnetic head and 
the magneto-optical disc are detected from changes in 

capacitance between a capacitance detection electrode (6) 
mounted on the magnetic head and a surface of the magneto-optical 

disc. An oscillator circuit (7) connected to the 
capacitance detection electrode varies its oscillation 

frequency in response to changes in capacitance and detects 
such frequency variations and controls the position of the 

magnetic head for maintaining it at a constant predetermined 
distance from the magneto-optical disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a magnetic 
head position control system and, more particularly to a 
system in which the magnetic head employed in recording a 
magneto-optical disc is driven to maintain a constant 
distance between the recording surface of the disc and the 
magnetic head. In a recording apparatus for a magneto-optical 
disc in general, an optical head and a magnetic head are 
disposed in a contact-free fashion on opposing sides of the 
disc. The recording apparatus operates in accordance with a 
magnetic field modulation system, whereby a magnetic field 
corresponding to the recording signal is generated by the 
magnetic head and applied to the magneto-optical disc, and 
the area of the disc that is subjected to the magnetic field 
is heated by a laser beam from the optical head, thereby 
effecting signal recording. Because of the information density requirements 
and the dimensions involved, the laser beam emitted from the 
optical head must be properly focused onto the disc. The 
optical head generally controls the focus by collecting 
focusing data produced by the laser light irradiated onto 
and reflected from the recording area of the disc, thereby 
producing a predetermined spot on the recording surface of 
the disc for recording. By this means, it is possible for 
the above described optical head to remain at a constant 
distance from the magneto-optical disc even when the 
relative position between the magneto-optical disc and the 
optical head is changed due to fluctuations in the thickness 
of the magneto-optical disc, the rotating disc deviates from 
its in-plane position, or the disc table adapted for 
rotating the disc is tilted. In the absence of some means 
for detecting the relative distance between the magnetic 
head and the magneto-optical disc, the magnetic head must be  
 
mounted at a position sufficiently spaced apart from the 
magneto-optical disc that the magnetic head will not contact 
the magneto-optical disc, even when the position of the 
magneto-optical disc fluctuates in one or more of the above 
described fashions. When the magnetic head is too far away from the 
magneto-optical disc, the power consumption is 
disadvantageously increased because the magnetic head must 
generate a stronger magnetic field for supplying the 
required recording magnetic field strength at the recording 
surface of the magneto-optical disc. In other words, when 
the separation between the magnetic head and the magneto-optical 
disc is excessive, unless the recording current
