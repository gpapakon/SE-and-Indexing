<DESCRIPTION>
The mechanism of bone loss is not completely 
understood, but bone loss disorders arise from an imbalance 
in the formation of new healthy bone and the resorption of 
old bone, skewed toward a net loss of bone tissue. This 
bone loss involves a decrease in both mineral content and 
protein matrix components of the bone. Ultimately, such 
bone loss leads to an increased fracture rate of, 
predominantly, femoral bones and bones in the forearm and 
vertebrae. These fractures, in turn, lead to an increase 
in general morbidity, a marked loss of stature and 
mobility, and, in many cases, an increase in mortality 
resulting from complications. Bone loss occurs in a wide range of subjects, 
including post-menopausal women, patients who have 
undergone hysterectomy, patients who are undergoing or have 
undergone long-term administration of corticosteroids, 
patients suffering from Cushing's syndrome, and patients 
having gonadal dysgenesis. The need for bone repair or 
replacement also arises locally in the case of bone 
fracture, non-union, defect, prosthesis implantation, and 
the like. Further, such need also arises in cases of 
systemic bone diseases, as in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, 
Paget's disease, osteomalacia, osteohalisteresis, multiple 
myeloma and other forms of cancer and the like. This invention provides methods for inhibiting 
bone loss, comprising administering to an animal an amount 
that inhibits bone loss of a compound of formula (I):  wherein:
 
   R¹ and R² are, independently, -H, -OH, halo, 
-OC₁-C₁₇ alkyl, -OC₃-C₆ cycloalkyl, -O(CO)C₁-C₁₇ alkyl, 
-O(CO) aryl, -O(CO)O aryl, or -OSO₂-(n-butyl or n-pentyl);
 
   R³ is 
and
 
   R⁴ is -H, methyl, ethyl, propyl, ethenyl or 
ethynyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or 
solvate thereof. The general chemical terms used in the 
description of a compound of formula I have their usual 
meanings. For example, the term "alkyl" by itself or as 
part of another substituent means a straight or branched 
chain alkyl radical having the stated number of carbon 
atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl, and 
higher homologs and isomers where indicated. The term "cycloalkyl" means a cyclic alkyl 
radical having the stated number of carbon atoms. Examples 
of cycloalkyl groups are cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and 
cyclohexyl. The term "aryl" includes groups such as phenyl, 
naphthyl, thienyl or furyl, each of which may be  
 
unsubstituted or monosubstituted with a group selected from 
hydroxyl, halo, C₁-C₃ alkyl, or C₁-C₃ alkoxy. The term
