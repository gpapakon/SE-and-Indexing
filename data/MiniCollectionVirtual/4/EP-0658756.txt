<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for sampling a partial volume of an aerosol, the partial volume being heated directly after sampling. The aerosol is fed to an analyser (6) by a sampling device (1), in particular via a sampling line (5), the sampling device (1) being heated. Heating of the sampling device (1) avoids deposition or condensation of aerosol particles in the sampling device (1) and the sampling line (5). This allows accurate analysis of the aerosol and in particular accurate measurement of the concentration of solid-like aerosol particles and accurate determination of a radioactivity quantity entrained in the aerosol, in a simple fashion. The invention furthermore relates to a sampling device (1) for carrying out the method.

<CLAIMS>
A sampling system having a sampling duct (16) and a
sampling means (1) arranged therein for taking a sample

volume of an aerosol, wherein the sampling means (1)
comprises a sampling opening (2) and a flow channel (3)

connected directly thereto, at which flow channel there
is arranged a heating element (4) for heating up the

sample volume directly after sampling,
characterised in that

the sampling opening (2) and the flow channel (3)
connected directly thereto are arranged in the flow

direction of the aerosol flowing in the sampling
duct (16),

and 
in that
 the heating element (4) comprises a heated
filament (9), which is embedded in a heat-conducting

material (10) in the form of a heat-conducting cement,
wherein the material (10) is sheathed in

insulation (14).
A sampling system according to claim 1, in which the

heating element (4) surrounds the flow channel (3).
A sampling system according to claim 1 or claim 2,
having an analyser (6) for analysing the aerosol,

wherein the aerosol may be fed from the sampling
device (1) through a sampling line (5) to the

analyser (6).
A sampling system according to claim 3, having a
temperature measuring device (7) for measuring the

temperature of the aerosol between the sampling
opening (2) and the analyser (6).
A sampling system according to claim 4, having a
control device (8) for controlling the heating

element (4) as a function of the measured temperature. 
Use of the sampling system according to one of claims
1 to 5, in an outgoing air and/or pressure relief duct

of a nuclear power plant.
