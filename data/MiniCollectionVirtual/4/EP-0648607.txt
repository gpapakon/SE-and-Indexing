<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet print head which contains a row of nozzles in the surface of a plate according to the face shooter principle, which row of nozzles is arranged in the z-direction and permits an ink jet to be projected in the y-direction, having a plate which is arranged as a membrane plate on a first chamber plate bearing the ink chambers, and having means for feeding and for ejecting ink from each chamber, has a second chamber plate on another plane. The chambers of the second chamber plate are arranged offset in the x-and z-directions relative to the chambers of the first chamber plate. There is thus minimal covering of chambers on adjacent planes. Following pretreatment of the plate material from which the print head is made, masking and etching of the plates are carried out in a parallel plate-processing operation for all the individual parts. Separated, finished single parts are connected to form a module and are bonded.
