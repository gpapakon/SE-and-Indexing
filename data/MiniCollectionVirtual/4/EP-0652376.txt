<ABSTRACT>
When actuators (5a,5b) are driven in parallel, 
load pressures from load lines (4a,4b) are guided to 

opening drive units (16a,16b) of pressure compensation 
valves (9a,9b) whereas upstream-side pressures of correcting 

variable restrictors (10a,10b) are guided to 
closing drive units (14a,14b). When downstream-side 

pressures of operating variable restrictors (11a,11b) 
exceed the sums of the load pressures and the spring 

forces of springs (15a,15b), closing drive forces are 
increased so that the openings of the valves (9a,9b) 

are reduced. When load pressures increase or the 
upstream-side pressures of the restrictors (11a,11b) 

drop, drive forces applied in the opening directions to 
the valves (9a,9b) increase relative to the upstream-side 

pressures so lowered so that the openings of the 
valves (9a,9b) are increased. The valves (9a,9b) are 

hence automatically controlled to keep constant the 
pressure differences across the restrictors (10a,11a; 

10b,10b), whereby the drive speeds of the actuators 
(5a,5b) are maintained constant irrespective of the 

load pressures as long as the corresponding restricted 
openings remain constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flow control system
arranged in a hydraulic circuit provided with a variable
displacement hydraulic pump, plural actuators driven by
pressure oil fed from said hydraulic pump and pump control
means for controlling the displacement of said hydraulic pump
so that a delivery pressure of said hydraulic pump becomes
higher by a predetermined value than a maximum load pressure
to said plural actuators, whereby the flow rate of the
pressure oil to be fed to said actuators is controlled, the
flow control system further comprising plural valve means
connected between said hydraulic pump and said actuators,
respectively, and pressure compensation valves arranged on
upstream sides as viewed in pressure oil feeding directions
of said plural valve means disposed corresponding to said
actuators.Such a flow control system is known from EP-A-0 440
802. In this document the load sensing system is provided
with a "before orifice" type pressure compensation valves for
maintaining a constant differential pressure with which each
actuator can be driven. The term "before orifice" means that
a pressure compensation valve is arranged on an upstream
side of the valve means. The technique disclosed in said
document is only concerned with load sensing control of a
pump. It is not possible to adjust flow distribution among
individual actuators. The purpose of the invention is to overcome this
disadvantage. Therefore, according to the invention, the flow
control system as described in the opening paragraph, is
characterized in that each of said plural valve means is
provided with a restrictor group with an operating variable
restrictor, whose opening can be varied by control means to
control the flow rate of the pressure oil to be fed to the
corresponding actuator, and a correcting variable restrictor
for correcting a pressure difference across said operating
variable restrictor, the opening of each of said pressure
compensation valves being independently set by a drive force
in an opening direction based on a downstream pressure of the
corresponding operating variable restrictor, a drive force in
the opening direction set by pressure-difference setting
means and a drive force in a closing direction based on an
upstream pressure of the corresponding, restrictor group so
that the upstream pressure of the corresponding restrictor group
becomes higher by a predetermined pressure than the
downstream pressure of the corresponding restrictor group.The present invention further relates to a flow
control
