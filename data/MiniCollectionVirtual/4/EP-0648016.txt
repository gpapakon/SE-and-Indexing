<ABSTRACT>
In a digital control pulse generator comprising a 
ring oscillator (2) composed of 32 inversion circuits 

connected in a ring for circulating a pulse (PA), a counter 
(6) and selectors (12 and 18) which turn data SL2 of a 

flip-flop (DFF 20) to High when a counted value of the pulse 
from a terminal Q8 of the ring oscillator (2) becomes a value 

corresponding to high order 10 bit CDH of control data, a 
pulse selector (4) for taking out a clock PSO of the DFF (20) 

from the inversion circuit at the position specified by 4 bit 
data CDLN and a delay line (22) and logical product circuit 

(24) which turns an output signal POUT of the apparatus to 
High for a predetermined time when the output QOUT of the DFF 

turns to High, a register (8) and adder (109) accumulate the 
low order 4 bit CDL of the control data every time POUT turns 

to High to update the data CDLN. As a result, the ring 
oscillator (2) may be continuously operated and an oscillation 

cycle proportional to the control data may be set.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital control
pulse generator which allows control of a pulse generating
cycle by digital data and which is applicable to a digital
control oscillator for example which allows control of its
oscillation cycle by digital data.Conventionally a voltage controlled oscillator (so-called
a VCO) which allows control of an oscillation frequency
thereof by an analog control voltage is used as a frequency
variable oscillator in a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) of
communication equipments, motor controlling equipments and
others.However, because such a VCO requires particular
resistors and capacitors to obtain a necessary central
oscillation frequency, it has such problems that such
resistors and capacitors have to be replaced in changing the
central oscillation frequency, that a fine adjustment of the
resistors and capacitors has to be made in order to maintain
its accuracy (its controllability is not good), and that its
power consumption is large because it uses an analog circuit.In view of this, in Japanese Publication No. JP-A-5-102801
(Watanabe US Application No. 956,955), the applicant
of the present invention has proposed a digital control 
oscillator comprising a pulse circulating circuit composed of
an odd number of inversion circuits linked in a ring, for
circulating a pulse signal, a switching circuit for increasing/decreasing
the number of linked stages of the inversion
circuits composing the pulse circulating circuit by even
numbers of stages according to digital data from the outside,
an output terminal for taking out the pulse signal circulating
within the pulse circulating circuit, a counter for
counting the pulse signal circulating within the pulse
circulating circuit to detect that the pulse signal has
circulated a number of times specified by the digital data
from the outside and an output circuit for outputting a
predetermined output signal at a timing wherein the pulse
signal from the output terminal is inverted when the counter
detects that the pulse signal has circulated by the number of
times specified by the digital data from the outside.In the apparatus proposed in Japanese Laid-Open
Patent No. 5-102801, the period of time which the pulse
signal requires to circulate the pulse circulating circuit
once (pulse circulating time) T (T = x * Td) is determined by
the number of linked stages of the inversion circuits
composing the pulse circulating circuit and the inversion
operating time Td of each inversion circuit, and the cycle by
which the output signal is
