<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording apparatus uses a recording 
head having discharge ports to discharge ink, and 

records by discharging ink from the recording head 
while enabling said recording head to travel in the 

direction of main scan. This apparatus comprises a 
recording head which is provided integrally with a 

plurality of recording units having a plurality of 
discharge port arrays for discharging ink of different 

colors, respectively, and then, the plurality of 
recording units are arranged in the direction of main 

scan to discharge ink of different densities, respectively. 
With the structure thus arranged, the 

recording in all the colors is not executed at a time 
thus making it possible to obtain an excellent image 

with a lesser deterioration of image due to ink blur 
and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording head and the recording by an ink jet
recording apparatus. More particularly, the invention
relates to the ink jet recording head which
uses ink having different densities for the same color
series for recording images.With the wide use of an information processing
apparatus, such as a copying machine, a word processor,
a computer, and also, of communication equipment, an
apparatus which digitally records images by use of a
recording head of an ink jet method has rapidly become
popular as one of the image formation apparatuses
(hereinafter referred to as recording apparatus)
serving as information output means for these
equipment. For a recording apparatus of the kind, it
is generally practiced that the so-called multinozzle
head, in which a plurality of ink discharge ports,
liquid passages conductively connected to these ports, 
and others are integrated, is used as a recording
element in order to improve the recording speed.As a recording method of the kind, there is
adopted for controlling a recording in an intermediate
tone, a dot density control method with which to
produce such an intermediate tone by controlling the
number of recording dots per unit area by the
application of the recording dots of a specific size,
or a dot diameter control method with which to produce
such an intermediate tone by controlling the sizes of
the recording dots.Here, the latter method which controls the dot
diameters requires a complicated control to be carried
out for the fine modification of the sizes of the
recording dots, hence automatically restrict its
implementation. In general, therefore, the former
method which controls the dot densities is adopted.The electro-thermal energy transducing elements,
which make a high resolution possible, are used because
of the ease with which to prepare the elements in a
high density, but it is also difficult to control the
amount of pressure variation, thus disabling the
diameters of the recording dots to be modulated. For
recording, therefore, the method for controlling dot
density is adopted.As one of the typical binarization methods for the
intermediate tonal representation used for the dot 
density control method, an organizational design method
may be employed. This method, however, has a problem
that the number of gradations is limited by the matrix
size. In other words, to increase the number of
gradations, it is necessary to make the matrix size
larger. If the matrix size is made larger, there is a
problem
