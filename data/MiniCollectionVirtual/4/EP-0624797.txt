<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for monitoring gaseous oxygen concentration that 
includes an oxygen sensor for providing an electrical sensor signal 

that varies as a function of oxygen concentration at the sensor. 
Processor circuitry compares oxygen concentration indicated by the 

sensor signal to at least one threshold level, and indicates when 
such oxygen concentration at the sensor departs from such threshold 

concentration level. The apparatus is calibrated by exposing the 
sensor to a calibration gas having an oxygen concentration equal to 

the desired threshold concentration level, and storing in the 
processor circuitry electrical indicia indicative of operating 

characteristics of the sensor at such threshold oxygen concentration 
level. When the apparatus is thereafter employed for monitoring a 

gas of undetermined oxygen concentration, the operating 
characteristics of the sensor reflected by the sensor output signal 

are compared to the prestored indicia for determining when oxygen 
concentration at the sensor crosses the threshold concentration level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to monitoring of gaseous oxygen
concentration, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for indicating
when oxygen concentration in a monitored gas equals or departs from one or
more threshold concentration levels.There are numerous applications in which it is desirable to indicate when
gaseous oxygen concentration departs from - i. e., becomes either greater than
or less than - one or more predetermined threshold concentration levels. For
example, in the home health care environment, it is desirable to monitor the
output of an oxygen concentrator to determine when the output oxygen level
decreases below a minimum desired limit, such as eighty-five percent oxygen.
In other industrial and commercial applications, it is desirable to maintain
oxygen concentration between preset lower and upper limits.GB-A-2 054 153 discloses a gas monitor which activates an alarm when a particular
gas concentration is detected, and which has means to inhibit alarm actuation
when the detected concentration does not result solely from a concentration
change. The gas monitor comprises an oxygen sensor, a processor circuit
with comparing means comparing with at least one threshold level, and
means indicating when an oxygen concentration measured by the oxygen sensor
departs from the threshold level.EP-A-0 270 088 discloses an automatic calibration apparatus for a partial gas
pressure measuring sensor. The apparatus comprises an abnormal supply detection
means which stops the calibration process if an abnormal supply of a
calibration gas is detected.EP-A-0 049 345 discloses a method for calibrating a gas concentration measuring
apparatus, wherein two gases having different concentration values are
supplied to a gas concentration sensor, and the corresponding measured concentration
values are stored and corrected by a computer unit. However, current devices for monitoring oxygen concentration are expensive
and subject to tampering at the application site. It is therefore
a general object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for monitoring
concentration of oxygen in a test gas and indicating when such concentration
departs from one or more preselected threshold levels, which is suitable for being
selectively reprogrammed at the factory or in the field, but which resists
tampering by unauthorized personel. An apparatus for monitoring gaseous oxygen concentration in accordance with
a presently preferred embodiment of the invention comprises
a printed board assembly comprising an
