<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to electromechanical 
devices such as alternators, generators, motors and the like. 
More specifically, the invention relates to heat dissipation 
methods and apparatus for such devices. Electromechanical devices are well known and commonly 
include a stator assembly and a rotor assembly. The stator 
includes a high magnetically permeable core, commonly formed 
as a laminated structure. The stator core further includes a 
back iron or yoke, usually cylindrical in shape, and a 
plurality of laminated stator teeth that generally extend 
radially inward from the back iron. Copper windings are 
formed and then installed on the stator teeth. An 
electrically insulating slot liner (ground insulation) is 
usually provided between each of the windings and the tooth 
that the winding surrounds. After the stator core is assembled it is usually shrink 
fitted into a housing with a sufficiently tight tolerance so 
that the core does not rotate in the housing, and the housing 
can function as a heat sink. A varnish type compound is 
commonly added at this point to protect the stator components 
from deleterious effects of fluids such as oil etc. The 
varnish also helps to mechanically restrain the coils, and to 
enhance the conductive heat transfer radially through the 
windings. The shrink fit assembly of the core in the housing can 
produce stress on the laminated core that tends to cause 
sections of the core laminations to buckle out of the plane of 
the core ends. To reduce this occurrence, an anti-buckling 
ring can be provided that is positioned on the outside end of 
the core contoured to the outer periphery of the back iron. 
This anti-buckling ring is narrow in width compared to the 
back iron thickness, thus providing virtually no heat sink 
contribution.  In most applications, particularly high power 
applications, the stator windings are used to carry the high 
currents used during operation. These high currents produce 
substantial IÂ²R losses due to the resistance of the stator 
windings, thus producing substantial amounts of heat. If left 
unchecked, this heat can increase rapidly and significantly to 
the point of damaging the slot liner ground insulation, the 
winding insulation and even cause delamination of the core. 
Thus, the life and reliability of the electromechanical device 
is directly related to operating temperatures, specifically 
the thermal endurance of the insulation system. For example, 
the design of an alternator requires a trade off between 
weight
