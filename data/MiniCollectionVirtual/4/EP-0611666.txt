<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a latent image carrier from which data can be reliably read for a long time. It includes a data storage layer 
(2) having a latent image pattern formed of fine phosphor paticles dispersed and held on a substrate (4a). When the layer (2) is 

irradiated with light having a predetermined wavelength, the luminescence from the fine phosphor particles is read as optical information. 
When irradiated with such light, the surface of the substrate (4a) has a reflectivity of at least 20%. The data storage 

layer (2) base thickness T of 0.5 to 20 µm above the upper surface of the substrate (4a), and a protective sheet (6a) is laminated 
on the substrate (4a) to cover the data storage layer (2) as a whole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a latent image 
forming member, such as an ID card, and more particularly 
to a latent image forming member having a latent image 
pattern, such as a bar code having fluorescent grains 
dispersed and held therein, and a method of manufacturing 
the same.  
 In recent years, control of articles by means 
of bar codes has been performed widely in various 
industrial fields while centering the PDS (Point Of 
Sales) in the distribution field. Along with this, a 
suggestion has been made that a non-visible bar code, 
that is, a latent image bar code is put on in terms of 
the improving design and security (see, for example, 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 52-80906). As for manufacturing of the latent image bar 
code, a method has been suggested (see, for example, 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 53-9607) in 
which a ribbon containing fluorescent gains is made to be 
transferred to paper by impact so that the latent image 
bar code is printed on to the paper. At present, if the latent image bar code of the 
foregoing type is formed on an ID card for use as a 
credit card or the like, there arise a problem of 
unsatisfactory durability, such as the wear resistance 
and chemical resistance against, for example, alcohol. 
It will come to be difficult to read, the latent image 
bar code as the card is repeatedly used. Therefore, the 
code of the foregoing type has a disadvantage that the 
card cannot be used for a long time.  
 The latent image can be obtained by printing, 
on, for example, white paper or plastic, with ink which 
is obtained by mixing 200g of sodium yttrium fluoride 
(NaYF4) fluorescent substance activated by, for example, 
ytterbium and erbium with 160g of vinyl chloride type 
resin and 40g of plasticizer, followed by dispersing the 
mixture in a 400g of solvent. When the latent image of 
the foregoing type is irradiated with infrared rays by, 
for example, a gallium arsenide (GaAs) infrared ray 
emitting diode, the ink emits light, the excited light 
having a wavelength different from that of the infrared 
ray. The reading apparatus for reading the latent image 
receives the excited light from the ink, and treat or 
process a signal of the light to read out the data 
recorded in the latent image. Since the excited light obtainable from the 
latent image is very weak, if infrared rays from the 
infrared ray source is not efficiently applied to the 
latent image or if the excited light from the latent 
image is not efficiently incident upon a

<CLAIMS>
A latent image forming member (1) comprising a base (4a, 
4b), and an information indication layer (2) formed on the base 

and having a latent image pattern, in which fluorescent grains 
are dispersed and held, so that when said information 

indication layer is irradiated with light having a 
predetermined wavelength to excite said fluorescent grains, 

information of light emitted from said fluorescent grains may 
be optically read, characterised in that: 


reflectance of a surface of said base with respect to 
light having said predetermined wavelength is 20% or higher, 
a projection amount (T) of said information indication layer 
from a top surface of said base is restricted to a range of 

from 0.5 to 20 µm, and 
a protection sheet (6a, 6b) is disposed which is 
laminated onto said base to cover all over said information 

indication layer and which permits light having said 
predetermined wavelength to pass therethrough. 
A latent image forming member according to claim 1, 
wherein a non-solvent type adhesive agent layer (5a, 5b) is 

formed on a surface, of said protection sheet (6a, 6b), 
adjacent to said information indication layer (2). 
A latent image forming member according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein a softening point of said information indication layer 

(2) is 80°C or higher.  
 
A latent image forming member according to claim 1, 2 or

chloride type resin.
