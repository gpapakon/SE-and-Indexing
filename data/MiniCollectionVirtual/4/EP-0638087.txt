<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel modified nucleotide compounds having the general formula: X-n(J)-(d or r)NTP where N is adenosine, guanosine or cytidine; X is H, a fluorophore, a chromophore, a luminescent compound, a ligand or a hapten; n is an integer of 7 or more; and J is a Jeffamine (TM Texaco, Inc.) substituent. These compounds are substantially superior substrates for incorporating label into nucleic acids during enzyme-catalyzed synthesis. Use of a Jeffamine-linked labelled nucleotide derivative as a partial substitute for unlabelled substrate therefore leads to significantly greater incorporation, hence increased label density per unit length of nucleic acid, than the same label joined by a prior art linker. Jeffamine-modified ribo- or deoxyribo-nucleotides are also provided for synthesis of Jeffamine-modified nucleic acids. The invention further provides an improved method of synthesizing labelled nucleic acids. This method provides greater frequency and higher efficiency of label incorporation, thus requiring lower amounts of nucleotide derivative in the reaction mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MODIFIED NUCLEOTIDESBACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTThe invention concerns novel compounds for nucleic acid labelling and methods for making nucleic acids incorporating the novel compounds.Techniques for labelling nucleic acids with a reporter molecule generally fall into one of two categories: incorporating the label into the nucleic acid during synthesis, or post- synthetically modifying the nucleic acid. The former is commonly accomplished by providing a labelled derivative of one of the precursor nucleotide triphosphates as a partial or complete substitute for the normal precursor during the enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of the nucleic acid. The labelled nucleotide derivative must meet certain criteria. The derivative must continue to be recognized by the enzyme as a substrate, it must not interfere with or inhibit the enzyme and it must participate in the normal hydrogen-bonding interactions of base pairing, adenine with thy ine (or uracil) , guanine with cytosine.Post-synthetic modification labelling is commonly accomplished by modifying the end group of a nucleic acid by means of a chemical reaction or by an enzyme such as terminal transferase.A wide variety of reporter molecules have been incorporated into nucleic acids. Besides radioactive labels, which are usually incorporated during synthesis, fluorescent labels, chromatic labels, luminescent labels, ligands and haptens have 

been employed. Rhodamine and fluorescein have been used for fluorescent labelling. Nitroblue tetrazolium and BCIP (5-bromo- 4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate) (Gibco BRL) have been used as chromophores. Firefly luciferin and PPD (4-methoxy-4-(3- phosphatenephenyl)spiro[l,2 dioxetane-3,2'-adamantane] (Gibco BRL) have been used as luminescent labels. Biotin has been used as a ligand to bind labelled streptavidin. Dinitrophenol and digoxigenin have been used as hapten labels to bind antibody and take advantage of immunoassay methods. The foregoing examples are illustrative only and not limiting.Radioactive labels have the advantage of providing high sensitivity, however they have the disadvantages of being expensive, of having short shelf life in some cases, and of presenting safety and disposal problems. While non-radioactive labels lack the disadvantages of radioactivity, they pose other difficulties for the potential user. Many of the reporter compounds are large, bulky molecules relative to the nucleotides themselves, and their size can sterically interfere with incorporation. Low levels of incorporation cause loss of detection
