<ABSTRACT>
D-β-Lysylmethanediamine represented by formula (I) or a salt or hydrate thereof has an activity of inhibiting the infection 
with AIDS virus or HIV, and hence an AIDS virus infection inhibitor containing the same as an active ingredient is prospective 

as one of the remedies for AIDS which is thought to be difficult to cure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical 
composition for use in inhibiting infection with a virus causative 
of acquired human immunodeficiency syndrome, namely 
AIDS virus (hereinafter sometime abbreviated as HIV), 
which composition comprises D-β-lysylmethanediamine, a 
salt or hydrate thereof as active ingredient. This 
invention also relates to a method for inhibiting the 
infection of human T-cells with AIDS virus, which comprises 
treating human T-cells in vitro with D-β-lysylmethanediamine, 
a salt or hydrate thereof. This invention 
further includes the use of D-β-lysylmethanediamine, a salt 
or hydrate thereof in the manufacture of antiviral 
composition for inhibiting the infection with AIDS virus. AIDS is a disease which is due to human 
T-cells being infected with AIDS virus. AIDS has brought 
about problems in human society. Several agents for 
inactivating HIV are reported. However, any of these 
HIV-inactivating agents is not necessarily satisfactory  
 
as a remedial agent for AIDS. Accordingly, there exists 
an outstanding demand to develop and provide such a new 
antiviral agent which is of low toxicity but can show 
a high activity to inhibit the infection of human T-cells 
with HIV. On the other hand, D-β-lysylmethanediamine as 
obtained earlier by the present inventors is an antibiotic 
which has weak antibacterial activity against Gram-positive 
bacteria. D-β-Lysylmethanediamine has the unique 
structure represented by the following formula (I) 
 
wherein (R) represents a stereochemical indicator. 
This compound is a known antibiotic which is produced 
by a microorganism, Streptomycesnashvillensis and which 
was reported by the present inventors (see "Journal of 
Antibiotics" Vol. 39, No. 3, page 476 (1986) and Japanese 
patent application first publication "Kokai" Sho-62-114947 
specification published 26 May 1987). D-β-Lysylmethanediamine 
hemi-carbonate (1/2 H2CO3) is in the form of a 
colorless powder which is hygroscopic but has no definite 
melting point measurable. Its specific optical rotation 
is [α] 26 / D -7.4° (c 0.5, water).  
 
The problem underlying the invention is the provision of 
compounds useful for treating AIDS virus infection. 
The problem is solved by the use of D-β-lysylmethanediamine. In order to achieve the above-mentioned objects, 
we, the present inventors, have made extensive investigations. 
In consequence, the present inventors, have 
now discovered that D-β-lysylmethanediamine, a salt or 
hydrate thereof exhibits a high activity in inhibiting 
the
