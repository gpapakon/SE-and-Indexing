<ABSTRACT>
A self-acting gas bearing, which may 
include a grooveless design, that effects smooth and 

precise rotation of a load over an extended series 
of start/stop cycles, includes a beam scanner using 

a self-acting gas bearing to support a beam 
deflector preferably in the form of a 

holographically-generated planar diffraction grating 
disk (i.e., a hologon). The contemplated gas 

bearing is designed to operate either vertically or 
tilted at an angle by use of a bottom grooved thrust 

plate to provide vertical lift. The weight of the 
rotor assembly, which includes the hologon and other 

components, is reduced (i.e., unweighted) by use of 
opposing magnets. The frictional degradation of the 

lower thrust plate at start-up and touch-down is 
therefore reduced. The amount of opposing magnetic 

force is easily controlled by selecting the spacing 
between the magnets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to light 
beam deflectors in beam scanning apparatus, and 
particularly to a light beam deflector having a 
self-pumped gas bearing. Laser sources combined with rotating beam 
deflection mechanisms are known for use in reading 
image information (also known as input scanning), 
exposing or printing image information (also known 
as output scanning), and displaying image 
information. For example, holographic beam 
deflectors rotate a holographic disk in the path of 
a stationary beam of light, such as from a laser 
source, and the rotation causes the beam to scan. 
The scanning beam produced by such an apparatus is 
made wobble-insensitive if the incident and 
diffracted angles of the monochromatic beam 
illuminating the holographic disk are kept 
essentially equal. Self-acting hydrodynamic bearings are 
preferred in high-speed rotating polygon and hologon 
laser beam deflection systems. Such a bearing 
supports the load (e.g., a holographic disk) by the 
pressure generated by a fluid flow in the bearing 
gap. The fluid flow is determined by the relative 
motion of the bearing surfaces and viscosity of the 
fluid. These bearings may be categorized according 
to the composition of the hydrodynamic fluid (gas, 
oil, grease, etc.). Self-acting gas bearings have the 
advantage that the threat of contamination of the 
hologon by oil or grease is avoided. However, the  
 
self-acting gas bearing requires relative movement 
of the bearing surfaces to generate a fluid pressure 
in the bearing gap. The bearing surfaces are in 
contact when the load is at rest and at start-up and 
shut-down. At speed, a self-acting gas bearing 
operates on a thin gas film that develops between 
the bearing surfaces. The thinness and low damping 
of a gas film make it necessary but extremely 
difficult to analyze the dynamic characteristics of 
the bearing for compliance, stability, and load 
carrying capacity at all of the possible excitation 
frequencies of the system. Self-acting gas bearings 
are also subject to complex instability phenomena 
which, if unchecked, lead to bearing failure. 
External vibrations at specific frequencies, or poor 
balance, can stimulate these instabilities. One major factor contributing to 
instability is typically referred to as the 
"mass/stiffness resonance." The stiffness of a 
self-acting gas bearing will change with speed and 
will not necessarily be linear with deflection. A 
self-acting gas bearing must therefore be designed 
such that its resonance frequency
