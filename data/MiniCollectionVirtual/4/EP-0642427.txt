<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting 
a deflated tyre on a vehicle suitable for cars, trucks or 
the like. Prior applications such as French Patent 
Publication No. 2568519 and European Patent Publication 
No. 291 217 propose using wheel speed signals from the 
vehicle wheels such as for example the signals from an 
anti-lock braking system which are multi-pulse signals of 
typically 48 to 96 pulses per revolution of each wheel. 
The prior art system compares the speed derived signals in 
various ways, and also attempt to overcome errors due to 
vehicle factors such as cornering, braking, accelerating, 
uneven or changing loads, which can cause changes in the 
speed signals which are larger than those caused by a tyre 
deflation of for example 0.4 bar. French Patent Publication No. 2568519 avoided 
errors of this type by monitoring the speeds of the 
diagonally opposed pairs of wheels for a long time or 
distance period so that it averaged out effectively 
cornering of the vehicle. The result however was that the 
device operated very slowly taking many Kilometres to 
sense a pressure loss. European Patent Publication No. 291 217 improved 
the situation by calculating the lateral and longitudinal 
acceleration of the vehicle using the same four wheel 
speed signals and setting fixed limits above which the 
detection system was inhibited to avoid false signals due 
to cornering and acceleration. This inhibition of 
detection however meant that for a proportion of the time 
of vehicle running the system was not sensing punctures, 
the actual proportion depending upon the type of roads and  
 
the way the vehicle was being driven. The real difficulty with these types of systems 
is that, apart from the lateral acceleration of the 
vehicle which occurs during cornering causing increased 
deflection of the outer pair of wheels compared to the 
inner pair of wheels, each vehicle has different 
characteristics due to the position of the centre of 
gravity and the type of suspension and these different 
characteristics when cornering produce additional 
deflections in the outer pairs of tyres with regard to the 
inner pairs of tyres. However the vehicle characteristics make the 
tyre deflections different in each of the tyres. Similar 
problems occur due to vehicle characteristics in the 
deflections in the front pair of tyres compared to the 
rear pair when the vehicle brakes, and vice-versa when the vehicle accelerates. Further, such a method of detecting a deflated tyre on a vehicle is known 
from

A method of detecting a deflated tyre on a 
vehicle by comparing the rolling radii of the tyres by 

means of comparing angular velocity speed signals from
