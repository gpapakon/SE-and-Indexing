<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to two new Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriocins having the amino acid sequences SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2, the signal peptides for these two bacteriocins, the nucleotide sequences encoding these bacteriocins especially an operon encoding the said bacteriocins having the sequence SEQ ID NO:3, the strains producing at least one of these bacteriocins, especially the strain CNCM 1-1351, a method for producing a supernatant extract comprising at least one of these two bacteriocins, and a use of these bacteriocins in the preparation of food products especially cheeses and acidified milks, and of cosmetic products as active agent against pathogens.
