<ABSTRACT>
Products for the variable controlled release of 
water soluble agents are disclosed. The products have a 

core of water soluble agent and a first and second 
coating. The first coating has a permeability such that 

the agent can be released at a controlled rate, while the 
second coating has a relatively low water vapor 

transmission rate. Variation in the coating thicknesses 
and coating conditions result in nutrient release 

profiles which can be tailored to specific plant 
requirements. After application of the product, release 

of the agent is negligible, but after a predetermined 
time, e.g. one month or more, substantial release of the 

agent from the coated product begins. The product is 

particularly suitable for delayed, controlled release 
fertilizers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to products
capable of releasing water soluble agents at different
rates over time. Specifically, the products are
fertilizers which can be packed with a seed or
seedling, and release nutrients in a fashion
consistent with the growing plant's needs. If
necessary, the products can be made to remain dormant
for a predetermined period of time before nutrient
release begins. In one embodiment, the pattern of nutrient
release is such that release may be substantially
delayed for a predetermined period of time followed by
a period of relatively high release.In another embodiment, a period of relatively
high initial release is followed by a period of
relatively low, constant release. In yet another
embodiment, a period of high initial release is
followed by a period of very low release and then a
second period of relatively high release. Since both
the relative amount and timing of nutrient release can
be predetermined, it is possible to fertilize plants
once per year or two without fear of damaging the
plants or harming the environment. True control over the rate of nutrient release by
fertilizers has long been known to be a desirable but
elusive goal. A plant's need for nutrients changes
from season to season, and species to species. As a
result farmers, foresters and gardeners have generally
relied on the use of repeated, timed doses of
fertilizers in an effort to obtain optimal plant
growth. A fertilizer product tailored to a plant's
specific needs over relatively long period of time,
would eliminate the need for one or more doses.Such products would be of great value to
nurserymen and foresters, the first because current
methods of fertilizing are labor intensive, and the
latter because such products could greatly increase
the rate of seedling survival.The invention generally relates to products
capable of releasing of water soluble agents such as
those exhibiting delayed, controlled release and those
having a relatively high initial release followed by a
relatively low, constant release. A "delayed,
controlled release" is defined as a release for which
onset is substantially delayed for a predetermined
period of time. Upon onset of release, the agent is
released at a controlled rate.This invention is particularly related to the
timed release of agents suitable for cultivating
horticultural growth, e.g. fertilizer products. By
the term "horticultural", it is meant to include not
only the science of growing fruits, vegetables,
flowers or ornamental plants, but also to
