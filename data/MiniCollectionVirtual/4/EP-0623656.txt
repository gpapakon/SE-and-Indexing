<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a water based water repellent 
coating composition, method of making and method of 

use. The coating composition comprises an emulsion 
having water as the continuous phase and, as the 

discontinuous phase, droplets of a nonvolatile organic 
water repellent composition, the emulsion containg an 

emulsion stabilizing amount of a hydrophobically 
modified polyacrylic acid polymer wherein the viscosity 

of the emulsion is less than about 100 Cps and the 
particle size of the droplets is less than about 50 

microns. The relatively low viscosity and small 
particle size provides for easy application and 

excellent penetration into porous substrates. The 
process of making the compositions involves the making 

of a conventional emulsion of this type and then high 

kinetic energy processing so as to produce the desired 
viscosity and particle size. The method of use 

involves the application of the composition to a 
substrate followed by evaporation of the water and any 

volatile components from the composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water repellent coating
compositions for making substrates water repellent, and
a method for making such compositions.Water repellent coating compositions or sealers
are generally low viscosity, colorless, penetrating
liquids. One of the primary functions of these water
repellent coating compositions is to prevent the
penetration of liquid water into the pores of the
substance to which the composition is applied. These
water repellent penetrating compositions are designed
to waterproof a variety of dry, porous substrates such
as wood, brick, and concrete.Water repellent coating compositions typically
contain a nonvolatile composition. This nonvolatile
composition contains the active water repellent
ingredients. These ingredients remain on and penetrate
into the treated substrate after the coating
composition is applied and the liquid carrier
evaporates. The active water repellent ingredients
contained in the nonvolatile composition can include a
variety of materials. These materials include various
waxes, resins, acrylics, fragrances, preservatives and
surface tension modifying chemicals.The carrier used in a typical water repellent
coating composition is usually a volatile organic
compound ("VOC") so that the entire composition is
organic. Recent actions by the Federal government to
strengthen the air quality laws at the national level
indicate that in the near future, all states will be
required to mandate that only low VOC products be
offered for sale nationwide. This reality has served
to drive the research towards development of water-based
equivalents to typical water repellent
compositions that are consumer-acceptable. Research in
the development of a consumer acceptable water-based 
water repellent coating composition has been ongoing
for quite some time.Unfortunately, the conventional surfactants that
are used in these compositions are not typically
volatile compounds and thus, when coated, remain after
the water carrier evaporates. The hydrophilic portion
of these compounds remain in the resulting coating and
thus, greatly reduce the water repellency.One potential alternative to the use of
conventional surfactants are the recently developed
hydrophobically modified high molecular weight
polyacrylic acid copolymers. These compounds are
typically used as thickening agents, primarily in
cosmetic compositions. However, they also can serve as
primary emulsifiers in oil-in-water emulsions and can
emulsify compositions such as linseed oil, epoxy resins
and asphalt.
