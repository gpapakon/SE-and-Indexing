<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a monoclonal antibody that recognises a structurally continuous and extracellularly-located epitope of human glycoprotein P (Pgp) which consists of a specific continuous epitope-forming amino acid sequence which is preferably located on the fourth extracellular loop of human Pgp and especially contained within the peptide of SEQUENCE ID NO. 1. Preferred antibodies according to the invention bind human Pgp specifically and with high avidity and thus may be used to identify human MDR cells when present as only a very low proportion of a cell population or when expressing human Pgp at only very low levels. The monoclonal antibody may be a whole antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof and may be prepared by hybridoma or recombinant DNA techniques. The monoclonal antibody is useful for the identification or purification of cells which express human Pgp, e.g. when contained in heterogeneous cell populations, and for monitoring the multi-drug resistant status of cells, e.g. tumour cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies which have
specificity for P-glycoprotein (Pgp). More particularly, the
invention relates to monoclonal antibodies to an extracellular
epitope of human Pgp and to their preparation and diagnostic and
clinical uses.The present description refers to various publications by
reference numbers in brackets and these are listed towards the
end of the text.The development by Kohler and Milstein (1) of somatic cell
fusion techniques for the production of hybrid cell lines which
produce monoclonal antibodies has made it possible to prepare
unlimited quantities of homogeneous antibody products which have
defined specificity for single antigenic determinants. The
portion of a protein antigenic determinant that is recognised by
and reacts with an antibody is known, and referred to herein, as
the epitope and consists of one or more specific epitope-forming
amino acid sequences.Glycoprotein P is a plasma membrane protein which is over-expressed
on the surfaces of cell lines or human tumour cells
that exhibit an intrinsic or acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR)
phenotype. The expression of this protein gives the cells the
ability to multiply actively in the presence of concentrations
of cytostatic drugs that are toxic for non-MDR parent cells.
Transfection studies using cloned Pgp cDNAs have demonstrated the
direct role of this protein in mediating the MDR phenotype (2).
Pgp is thought to function as an energy-dependent drug efflux
pump.The amino acid sequence of Pgp has been deduced from the
nucleotide sequences of the genes that confer the MDR phenotype
in recipient cells (2, 3, 4). The secondary structure of Pgp has
been predicted from analysis of its primary structure and is that 
of a transmembranal protein consisting of 12 hydrophobic
transmembranal helices linked via 6 hydrophilic extracellular
loops and 2 large cytoplasmic domains encoding 2 ATP-binding
sequences.A number of different monoclonal antibodies to Pgp have been
isolated and characterised, and the specificities of some of
these are reviewed by Cenciarelli et al. (5). More recently
further monoclonals have been described which have specificity
for the extracellular domain of Pgp (6, 7, 8) . However monoclonal
antibodies to Pgp for which the specific epitope-forming amino
acid sequences have been characterised react either with the
cytoplasmic domain of Pgp or with extracellular epitopes
comprising discontinuous portions of the amino acid sequence of
the protein. For example, Georges et al. (8) have
