<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the use of angiotensin II antagonists in treating or preventing the development of disease conditions associated with impaired neuronal conduction velocity, such as diabetic neuropathy, as well as their use in the manufacture of a medicament for use in such treatment. The invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions containing an angiotensin II antagonist together with one or more other agents known to be of value in treating or preventing the development of disease conditions associated with impaired neuronal conduction velocity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to therapeutic agents and in particular to the use of
compounds having angiotensin II antagonist activity (hereinafter "AII antagonists") for
the treatment or prevention of disease conditions associated with impaired neuronal
conduction velocity in warm-blooded animals including man. The invention also
concerns the use of a compound having AII antagonist activity in the production of a
medicament for use in the treatment or prevention of disease conditions associated with
impaired neuronal conduction velocity.Impaired neuronal conduction velocity is a feature of nerve dysfunction
commonly found, for example, in diabetic patients, and in disease conditions, such as
alcoholic, toxic or compression neuropathy. Consequently an agent which prevents or
reverses impairment of nerve conduction velocity may have a beneficial effect in the
treatment or prevention of such medical conditions in which nerve conduction velocity
is reduced, for example, diabetic neuropathy. We have now surprisingly discovered
that impaired neuronal conduction velocity in a diabetic rat is significantly reversed by
administration of an AII antagonist. AII antagonists are described, for example, in EPA
0528762 which is citeable under Art.54(3) EPC.According to the invention there is provided the use of an AII antagonist,
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for
use in the treatment or prevention of the development of disease conditions associated
with impaired neuronal conduction velocity.Typical AII antagonists useful in the invention include:-
(a) 2-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole
described in European Patent Application
(EPA), Publication No. 253310; (b) 2-butyl-3-(2'-(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
described in EPA, Publication No. 399731;(c) 5,7-dimethyl-2-ethyl-3-(2'-(tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
described in EPA, Publication No. 400974;(d) 1-[[3-bromo-2-[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl]-5-benzofuranyl]-methyl-2-butyl-4-chloro-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic
acid described in EPA,
Publication No. 434249;(e) 2-ethyl-4-[(2'-(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)-methoxy]quinoline

yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methoxy]quinoline described in EPA, Publication No. 453210;(g)
