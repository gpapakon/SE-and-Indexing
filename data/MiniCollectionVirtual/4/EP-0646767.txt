<ABSTRACT>
An absolute interferometer has part of the beam paths 
making up its measuring and reference arms formed in a 

waveguide, and part formed in air. The part formed in the 
waveguide are common mode so that the path length 

difference is formed in air, thus minimising inaccuracies 
in the measurements caused by temperature changes in the 

waveguide. Phase modulators in the waveguide enable 
interpolation of the fringe counts to be made to high 

resolution. In Fig 2 the absolute interferometer is shown 
combined with a tracking interferometer, and with air 

refractometers all of which have parts of their measuring 
and reference arms in the waveguide in common mode and 

symmetrical with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to interferometric distance
measuring apparatus and in particular relates to such
apparatus which measure distances in absolute terms.It is known, for example, from U.S. Patent No. 3,970,389 to
measure directly the path difference in an interferometer
while that path difference is held constant. Hence where
the fixed distance from the interferometer to an object is
made the measuring arm of the interferometer that distance
can be measured absolutely.The method of measurement disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
3,970,389 is to vary the frequency of the laser light
source between two known values, thereby changing the
wavelength of the laser and the optical path length through
each of the measuring and reference arms of the
interferometer. Using a detector to count the interference
fringes generated by a photo-electric detector which
receives the combined beam returning from the measuring and
reference arms, the path difference between the measuring
and reference arms can be determined.Laser diodes are now commonly proposed as light sources for
interferometric measurement apparatus because of their
advantages of size and cost.Substitution of a laser diode for the gas laser described
in U.S. Patent No. 3,970,389 is not, however, a
straightforward process. First of all it is not easy to
vary the frequency of a laser diode between two specific
frequencies with great accuracy, and secondly, with the
most commonly used laser diodes the range of frequencies
over which the laser diodes can be varied continuously is
limited to around 100 parts per million (ppm). This
requires high precision interpolators to achieve the high 
accuracies, or high resolutions required for some
interferometers.High precision interpolators are known from fibre optic
gyroscope technology. These interpolators use the
principle of phase modulation.It is known to produce phase modulation in light passing
through waveguides. European Patent Publication No.
EP 516044-A2 describes a tunable laser diode formed on a
semiconductor substrate. The described diode includes
waveguide portions formed in the substrate and electrodes
for modulating the refractive index of the waveguides,
which in effect produces phase modulation in the light
passing down the waveguide.An interferometer which uses waveguides to direct the
light is known from WO91/12487.However, the materials from which waveguides are made have
thermal coefficients associated with length and refractive
index which are significantly different than in air, so
that
