<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to galanthamine derivatives, a process for their
preparation and their use as medicaments.WO 88/08708 discloses galanthamine derivatives such as 6-O-demethylgalanthamine
and 6-methylaminocarbonyl-6-O-demethylgalanthamine for
the inhibition of acetylcholineserase and useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease.This invention relates to compounds of the formula (I)

wherein
R1is hydrogen, (C1-C12)alkylcarbonyl, (C1-C12)alkoxycarbonyl,
mono(C1-C12)alkylaminocarbonyl or di(C1-C8)alkylaminocarbonyl;R2is monocyclic or multiple ring (C3-C12)cycloalkylcarbonyloxy or
monocyclic or multiple ring (C3-C12)cycloalkyl(C1-C12)-alkylcarbonyloxy;R3is hydrogen, halo or (C1-C4)alkyl;R4is hydrogen or (C1-C6)alkyl;
   all geometric, and optical and stereoisomers thereof, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof;
which are useful for alleviating various memory dysfunctions such as found in
Alzheimer's disease.This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition useful for
alleviating various memory dysfunctions characterized by decreased cholinergic 
function which comprises a compound of the invention in an amount sufficient to
affect cholinergic function and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the following definitions shall apply
throughout the specification and appended claims.The term "alkyl" shall mean a straight or branched alkyl group of the stated
number of carbon atoms. Examples include methyl, ethyl,
n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, and straight and branched
chain pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and dodecyl.The term "halo" shall mean chloro, fluoro, bromo and iodo.The term "cycloalkyl" shall mean a cycloalkyl group of from 3 to 12 carbon
atoms such as for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl,
cycloheptyl and cyclododecyl and including multiple ring alkyls such as for
example, norbornanyl, adamantyl, cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octanyl, camphoryl, and 3-noradamantyl.In a preferred embodiment are compounds of the formula (II)

wherein
R1is hydrogen, (C1-C12)alkylcarbonyl, (C1-C12)alkoxycarbonyl;R2is monocyclic or multiple ring (C3-C12)cycloalkylcarbonyloxy or
monocyclic or multiple ring (C3-C12)cycloalkyl-(C1-C12)alkylcarbonyloxy;R3is hydrogen or halo;R4is hydrogen or (C1-C6)alkyl; 
   and all geometric, optical and sterioisomers and pharmaceutically acceptable
addition salts thereof.More preferably R1 is hydrogen, (C1-C12)alkylcarbonyl or
(C1-C12)alkoxycarbon
