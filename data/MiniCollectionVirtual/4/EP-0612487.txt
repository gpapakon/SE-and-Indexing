<ABSTRACT>
A method of molding a separable bottom stop assembly 
on a concealed slide fastener, comprising: 

forming a number of space portions (6) devoid of fastener 
elements (4) at predetermined intervals in a concealed 

slide fastener chain (1); impregnating molten 
synthetic resin in fastener tapes (7) at areas around 

the space portion (6); heat-molding and hardening the 
tapes (7) in such a manner that confronting edge portions 

of the tapes (7) are turned over; cutting the 
tapes (7) across the space portion (6); injection 

molding a second pin member (14) of the separable 
bottom stop assembly (3) on the edge portion of one 

tape (7) and a first pin member (22) of a box member 
(19) on the edge portion of the other tape at the 

space portion (6), contiguously to the fastener elements 
(4); and attaching a box (22) to the first pin 

member (22) to complete the box member (19). The 
result is that a separable concealed slide fastener, 

which could not be put to practical use conventionally, 
can be manufactured simply.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for attaching
to one end of a fastener chain of a concealed slide
fastener a separable bottom stop assembly, which has
the function of disconnecting the connected stringers
from one another and connecting the disconnected
stringers together, according to the fastener closing
and opening operation of a slider.In most of conventional concealed slide
fasteners, the lower end of a fastener chain is
permanently closed by a bottom stop, and a concealed
slide fastener of the separable type, in which the
fastener chain is separable using a separable bottom
stop assembly, could not be put to practical use.This separable type concealed slide fastener
(Japanese Utility Model Publication No. SHO 48-39366)
is known in which an auxiliary tape such as of a
synthetic resin film or a taffeta tape is attached to
the fastener chain's space portion devoid of fastener
elements, and a metallic first pin member and a metallic
second pin member, both larger than the width of
fastener element, are mounted on and around the confronting 
edges of the space portion, and a special-shape
box is attached to the first pin member.Another conventional concealed slide fastener
(Japanese Utility Model Publication No. SHO 51-4816)
is known in which an auxiliary tape such as of a
synthetic resin film or a taffeta tape is attached to
a space portion devoid of fastener elements, and a
synthetic resin second pin member and a synthetic resin
unitary box member integrally combined of a box and
a first pin member are attached to the confronting
edges of the space portion by injection molding.With the conventional separable concealed slide
fastener, since the auxiliary tape such as of a synthetic
film or a taffeta tape is stuck to a separable
bottom end portions of the fastener chain, the thickness
of the resulting tapes would be larger than that of the
remaining portions, so that the appearance would be
unsightly and it is difficult to give a suitable degree
of hardness to the separable bottom end portions of the
fastener chain, thus causing unsmooth operation of the
separable bottom stop assembly.Further, since the auxiliary tape is attached
over the sewing thread staying on the element-free
portion, the tape edge portions cannot be turned over
accurately so that precise attachment of the box
member and the second pin member is difficult to achieve.
Therefore no concealed slide fastener with a separable 
bottom stop assembly has been put to practical use.It is therefore an object of this invention to
provide a

<CLAIMS>
A method of molding a separable bottom stop
assembly on a concealed slide fastener, comprising the

steps of:

(a) forming a number of space portions (6)

such a manner that confronting edge portions of said

tapes (7) at each of said space portions (6) are
turned over;
(d) cutting said tapes (7) across said space
portions (6);
(e) injection molding a second pin member (14) of
said separable bottom stop assembly (3) on the edge

portion of one tape (7) and at least part of a box member (19) of said
separable bottom stop assembly (3) on the edge portion

of the other tape (7) at each of said space portions
(6), contiguously to said fastener elements (4),

said box member (19) including a first pin member
(20, 22) and a box (21, 23) molded integrally or separately.
A separable bottom stop assembly molding
method according to claim 1, wherein said box member

(19) of said separable bottom stop assembly (3) is composed 
of a first pin member (22) to be firstly injection

molded on the edge portion of said tape (7) and an
injection molded box (23) to be threaded onto said first

pin member (22).
A separable bottom stop assembly molding
method according to claim 1, wherein said box member

(19) of said separable bottom stop assembly (3) is
composed of a first pin member (20) and a box (21)

which are molded integrally.
