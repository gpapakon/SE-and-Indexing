<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shared register circuit
structures, in particular to such circuit structures
coupled to data transmission lines through interfacing
circuit means of the serial type for use in storage systems
or microprocessors.Many integrated circuit applications require a variety of
registers which may be configured for operation in
different modes.Such registers receive usually input data from an interface of
the serial type, rather than parallel, in order to reduce
the amount of area occupied and the number of external
terminals for the devices.Interface circuit means of the serial type are then
operated to address each transmitted data bit into the
appropriate register.Thus, provided within the integrated circuit are shift
register circuit means operative to store both the
addresses and the data, as well as transmission paths of
the parallel type whereby the data can be written into
specified registers in accordance with the addresses.The number of such transmission paths of the parallel type
required to write the data into registers to which it has
been addressed is both dependent on the number of the data
registers and the number of bits used to encode the data,
and in an integrated circuit involves occupation of large
amounts of integration area, if data reliability and safety
are to be ensured.This reflects heavily on costs being proportional to the
integration area in the instance of integrated circuit 
devices.Attendant to the unfavorable occupation of integration area
is then a problem of speed in data reading from the
registers, because such reading is to be carried out in two
discrete steps: a first step of address decoding, and a
second step of actual data reading from a register to which
the read operation has been addressed.During the write operation address decoding and data
writing in a specified register take place in parallel.The highest rate of operation in a conventional multi-register
system is, therefore, the inverse of the sum of
the times required to decode a register address and then
read the data from the selected memory cell.An example of shared register circuit structure containing
a plurality of registers and coupled to transmission lines
by interfacing circuit means of the serial type based on
transferring data after addresses on same lines as indicated in the preamble of claim 1 is
disclosed in the IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, vol.
16, no. 3, June 1981, p. 190-194.The underlying technical problem of this invention is to
provide a shared register
