<ABSTRACT>
An aluminium pigment comprising aluminium flakes, the 

surfaces of which are coated with a film of molybdic acid in 
an amount of 0.1 to 10% by weight in terms of Mo based on the 

aluminium, and further coated with a phosphoric film derived 
from a phosphoric compound selected from inorganic phosphoric 

acids, organic phosphoric acid esters having one phosphate 
group and their salts in an amount of 0.05 to 1% by weight in 

terms of P based on the aluminium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aluminium pigments which
may be incorporated into water base paints used for finish coating, for
example, car bodies as well as to water base paints and inks.Aluminium pigments to be incorporated in water base
paints and water base inks are described in many prior
publications.JP-B-59009729 describes a treatment of aluminium flakes
with an aqueous solution containing phosphoric acid or its salt
so as to obtain an aluminium pigment. By this treatment, an
aluminium pigment in which the production of hydrogen gas
by the reaction of the aluminium flakes with water is inhibited can be
obtained. This treatment however has important defects. The
resultant coating has a poor colour tone and the colour tone
of the coating is spoiled when the coating is dipped in hot
water. JP-B-85008057 describes the treatment of the aluminium
flakes with a phosphate ester having C6 or greater alkyl group(s)
so as to obtain the aluminium pigment. By this treatment, an
aluminium pigment in which the production of hydrogen gas
is inhibited and which has a good colour tone can be obtained. This treatment however
has another important defect. The aluminium pigment has a 
very poor adhesion to a resin contained in the water base
paint.Treatment of the aluminium flakes with acid phosphate
esters modified with organic functional groups so as to obtain
aluminium pigments are also described in many prior
publications. For example, JP-A-85015466 describes the
treatment of the aluminium flakes with a phosphate ester
modified with an aromatic ring-containing functional group and
an amino group, but this treatment cannot give a satisfactory
improvement in the adhesion of the aluminium pigment to the
resin. JP-B-90015590 describes the treatment of the aluminium
flakes with a phosphate ester having a carboxyl group at its
terminal, but the inhibition of the production of hydrogen gas
and the improvement in the adhesion of the aluminium pigment are
insufficient.JP-B-89054386 describes the treatment of the aluminium
flakes with chromic acid so as to obtain an aluminium pigment.
By this treatment, an aluminium pigment which has a good
stability in the water base paint, in which the
production of hydrogen gas is inhibited and which has excellent colour tone
can be obtained. The adhesion of the aluminium pigment
with the resin can also be improved. When the aluminium
pigment comprises fine aluminium flakes, however, this treatment
causes the dissolution of the fine aluminium flakes due to the
high reactivity of

<CLAIMS>
An aluminium pigment comprising aluminium
flakes, the surfaces of which are coated with a film of

molybdic acid in an amount of 0.1 to 10% by weight in terms
of Mo based on the aluminium, and further coated with a

phosphoric film derived from a phosphoric compound selected
from inorganic phosphoric acids, organic phosphoric acid

esters having one phosphate group and their salts in an
amount of 0.05 to 1% by weight in terms of P based on the

aluminium.
An aluminium pigment according to claim 1,
wherein the salt of the organic phosphoric acid ester

consists of the organic phosphoric acid ester and a fatty
primary or secondary amine.
An aluminium pigment according to claim 2,
wherein the fatty primary or secondary amine contains 3 to 36

carbon atoms in total.
An aluminium pigment according to any one of
claims 1 to 3, wherein the phosphate group of the organic

phosphoric acid is adsorbed on the film of molybdic acid or
reacted with the fatty primary or secondary amine.
A water base metallic paint or ink comprising
the aluminium pigment as defined in any one of claims 1 to 4.
An article coated with a metallic coating film
comprising the aluminium pigment as defined in any one of

claims 1 to 4.
A process for preparing a aluminium pigment as
defined in any one of claims 1 to 4, which comprises treating

aluminium flakes with an alkaline aqueous solution of
ammonium molybdate to form the film of molybdic acid on the

aluminium flakes, and subsequently treating the thus coated
aluminium flakes with a solution containing the phosphoric

compound to form the film derived from a phosphoric compound.
