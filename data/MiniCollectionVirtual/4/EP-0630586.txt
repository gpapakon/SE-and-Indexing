<ABSTRACT>
The filling of a cigarette (3) is controlled by 
detecting a brightness curve (18; 37) of at least one 

part of the open end of the cigarette (3), processing 
the resulting brightness curve (18; 37) to obtain a 

contrast index, and comparing the resulting contrast 
index with an equivalent index of a correctly filled 

cigarette (3) to obtain a signal indicating acceptance 
of the cigarette (3) under observation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cigarette filling
optical control method.More specifically, the present invention relates
to a method of controlling the conformation of the open
end of cigarettes and, in particular, the presence or
absence of tobacco at the open end, on a cigarette
manufacturing machine and/or filter assembly machine
and/or packing machine.At the output of a cigarette manufacturing
machine and/or filter assembly machine and/or at the
input of a packing machine, the cigarettes are normally
subjected to numerous checks comprising a check of
the filling to determine the presence or absence of
tobacco at the open end of the cigarettes.In most cases, filling control consists in illuminating
the front surface of the open end of the cigarette
by means of a light source; forming an image of the front
surface by means of a detecting unit featuring a telecamera
or equivalent optical monitoring system; and
transmitting the image to a comparing unit for comparing
it with a specimen image and emitting a reject signal
in the event the detected and specimen images differ
over and above a given limit.In general, the difference in the detected and
specimen images depends on differences in shading
which, as is known, varies according to the presence of
gaps on the front surface due to the absence of tobacco.
Unfortunately, the shading of the detected image has
been found to depend largely, not only on the presence
of gaps, but also on the colour of the tobacco employed,
so that known devices of the above type involve expensive,
time-consuming setup procedures whenever the
type of tobacco is changed.FR-A-2,312,975 shows a filling control device,
according to which filling control consists in illuminating
the front surface of the open end of the cigarette by
means of a light source; detecting by a sensor the
brightness reflected by the open end; transforming the
detected brightness in an electric signal to be compared
with a threshold value; and correcting the electric signal
by a further signal, which keep in account the distance
between the cigarette end and the sensor. The above
filling control has proved to be unsatisfactory because
the sensor detects the overall brightness reflected by a
cigarette open end without distinguishing different areas
of the open end. This fact renders the above filling control
particularly ineffective when the color of tobacco
varies.According to a device shown in GB-B-1,112,687,
the filling control consists in illuminating the
front surface of the open end of the

A cigarette filling optical control method
comprises a stage consisting in detecting at least one

brightness curve (18; 37) of at least one part of the
open end (2) of the cigarette (3) under observation; the

method being 
characterized by
 the further stages of
processing the brightness curve (18; 37) by means of a

differentiating block (19), the output signal of which,
corresponding to a contrast curve, is further processed

to obtain a contrast index; said brightness curve (18;
37) being detected by means of an optical device (1)

presenting a reference plane consisting of a fixed
focusing plane (10) of the optical device (1) and being

supplied by a sensor (17) of said optical device (1);
the sensor (17) receiving a light beam (5) reflected by

said open end (2) of the cigarette (3) and focused by a
fixed-focus lens (7) presenting said fixed focusing

plane (10) and a substantially zero depth of field; and
comparing the contrast index with an equivalent given

index to obtain a signal indicating acceptance of the
cigarette (3) under observation.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 it provides for detecting two brightness curves

respective fixed focusing planes (10a, 10b) arranged
symmetrically in relation to a reference plane (10).
A method as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 said brightness curves (18; 37) are supplied by
respective sensors (17) of the respective optical

devices (26); each sensor (17) receiving a respective
portion (5a, 5b) of a light beam (5) which is reflected

beam portion (5a, 5b) being focused by a respective

fixed-focus lens (28a; 28b); each optical device (26)

cigarette (3) under observation in relation to the
reference plane.

 the position of the cigarette (3)
under observation in relation to the reference plane

(10) is detected by extending observation of the open
end (2) of the cigarette (3) to a layer (36) of
