<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a separation-type air 
conditioner capable of increasing the heat exchanging area of 

a compact indoor unit and of effecting high-performance heat 
exchange, and particularly employable as a high-performance yet 

compact indoor unit whose height is low. A front heat 
exchanger (7) having a configuration in which an upper edge 

portion and a lower edge portion are respectively made to 
recede is disposed in an indoor unit. In addition, a rear heat 

exchanger (12) separate from the front heat exchanger (7) is 
disposed on the rear surface side of the front heat exchanger 

(7). Consequently, it is possible to increase the heat 
exchanging area in an indoor unit having the same height, and 

improve the heat exchanging capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separate-type air
conditioner in which an indoor unit is separated.Fig. 21 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a
conventional separate-type air conditioner shown in, for
instance, Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No.
118430/1985. In the drawing, reference numeral (1) denotes a
casing of an indoor unit of a separate-type air conditioner;
(2), a front panel at the front surface of the casing (1); (3),
a front air inlet provided in the front surface of the front
panel (2); (4), an upper air inlet provided in the upper
surface of the front panel (2); (5), an air outlet provided at
the underside of the front panel (2); and (6), a cross flow fan
provided in the casing (1) and disposed at a position
corresponding to the air outlet (5).Numeral (7) denotes a front heat exchanger disposed in
the casing (1) and having an upper edge portion and a lower
edge portion which are respectively formed in a receding manner
and are disposed at positions corresponding to the front air
inlet (3) and the upper air inlet (4), respectively. Numeral
(8) denotes fins which are formed of a multiplicity of aluminum
plates which are juxtaposed horizontally in a mutually spaced-apart
relationship, their plate surfaces being arranged along
the blowing direction of the cross flow fan (6). Numeral (9) 
denotes hair pin tubes of the front heat exchanger (7), the
hair pin tubes (9) being formed by a plurality of heat
exchanging pipes penetrating the fins (8).Numeral (10) denotes notched portions which are formed
on the front and back sides of each fin (8) at a longitudinally
intermediate position thereof, and numeral (11) denotes a
filter disposed in front of the front heat exchanger (7).The conventional separate-type air conditioner is
arranged as described above, and as the cross flow fan (6) is
operated, air in the room to be air-conditioned is sucked
through the front air inlet (3) and the upper air inlet (4) of
the casing (1), and the dust in the air is removed by the
filter (11). Then, heat exchange is effected by the front heat
exchanger (7), and conditioned air is supplied through the air
outlet (5) to the room to be air-conditioned.In addition, Fig. 22 is an enlarged view corresponding
to a portion XXII of Fig. 21 above, and illustrates another
conventional separate-type air conditioner. In the drawing,
reference numeral (81) denotes a bent connecting portion of the
fins (8), and (82) denotes an opening which is formed on the
front side of the bent portion as the fins (8) are bent

<CLAIMS>
A separate-type air conditioner comprising:

a front heat exchanger (7) disposed in an indoor unit and having an upper edge
portion and a lower edge portion respectively formed in a receding manner; and
a rear heat exchanger (12) formed separately from said front heat exchanger and
disposed on a rear side of said front heat exchanger (7);
wherein said rear heat exchanger (12) is disposed such that an upper edge of
said rear heat exchanger (12) is disposed in opposing relation to an upper edge of said

front heat exchanger (7), such that a gap is defined between a portion of the upper edge
of said rear heat exchanger (12) which is closest to said front heat exchanger (7) and a

portion of the upper edge of said front heat exchanger (7) which is closest to said rear
heat exchanger (12), and a lower edge side of said rear heat exchanger (12) is disposed

in such a manner as to be inclined in a direction away from said front heat exchanger
(7).
