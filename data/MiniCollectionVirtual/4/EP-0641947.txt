<ABSTRACT>
Water pumps for delivering the coolant for internal combustion engines are rigidly driven by way of a V-belt drive, i.e. they are directly dependent on the speed of the internal combustion engine. The rotational speed of the water pump and hence its delivery rate is therefore not always matched to the respective cooling requirement of the internal combustion engine. The technical problem here is to provide a controlled water pump drive in a simple manner. The solution to this problem is such that the water pump impeller is driven by way of a fluid friction clutch. The fluid friction clutch is preferably structurally integrated into the water pump impeller. A drive device of this kind for a water pump can be employed, in particular, for water-cooled internal combustion engines in motor vehicles.
