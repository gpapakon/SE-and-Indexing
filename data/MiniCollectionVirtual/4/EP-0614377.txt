<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionMETHOD FOR DIAGNOSING AND TREATING CANCER5 Statement of Government InterestThis invention was made with government support under contract DE-A606-76RLO 1830, awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.10 Technical FieldThe present invention relates generally to methods for diagnosing and treating cancer.Background of the Invention15 Cancer accounts for one-fifth of the total mortality in the UnitedStates, and is the second leading cause of death after cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The three leading types of tumors found in man are lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, and the three leading types of tumors found in women are breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. Common therapeutic approaches for the20 treatment of cancer generally involve the surgical removal of solid tumors, followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. One disadvantage of this general approach, however, is that most chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic agents are not tumor-cell specific, thus damaging normal tissue during the course of treatment.25 Various methods have been utilized in order to more effectively direct or target therapeutic agents to tumor cells. For example, many tumor cells have an increased number of certain cell surface antigens as compared to normal cells. This difference between tumor and normal cells may be exploited in order to more effectively target therapeutic agents to tumor cells. More specifically,30 targeting agents such as monoclonal antibodies may be used to specifically target and bind to the tumor cells, resulting in the localization and internalization of the ' therapeutic agents. For example, monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-gpl6() antibody for human lung cancer {see Sugiyama et al., "Selective Growth Inhibition of Human Lung Cancer Cell Lines Bearing a Surface Glycoprotein gp lόO by 125I-35 Labeled Anti-gpl60 Monoclonal Antibody," Cancer Res. 48:2168-2113, 1988), a "TNT-l" monoclonal antibody for human cervical carcinoma (see Chen et al, 'Tumor Necrosis Treatment of ME- 180 Human Cervical Carcinoma Model with 

 -^I-Labeled TNT-1 Monoclonal Antibody," Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California), and antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor for KB carcinoma (see Aboud-Pirak et al., "Efficacy of Antibodies to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Against KB Carcinoma In Vitro and in Nude Mice," J. National Cancer Institute ■50(20):1605-1611, 1988) have been
