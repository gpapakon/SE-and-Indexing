<ABSTRACT>
In a system, several electric items (10, 12, 14, 16) of various types are connected each by an interface to a common bus constituted by fiber optic sections (18, 20, 22, 24) and which forms a closed ring. Each apparatus is connected to the bus by a connector block (30). The connector block (30) has electric contacts for connecting with the respective apparatus, a fiber optic input and a fiber optic output inserted between two fiber optic sections (18, 20, 22, 24). The connector block (30) contains two electrooptical transducers for converting optical signals arriving via the bus into electric signals and for converting electric signals coming from the electric contacts into optical signals transmitted via the bus. In order to ensure the integrity of the whole bus system even when an item breaks down, the optical path inside each connector block (30) is automatically bridged when the connected apparatus is faulty or when no apparatus is connected. As bridging element a concentrating reflector (118) may be used.
