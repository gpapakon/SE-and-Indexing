 SYSTEM FOR SUPPORTING CONDUCTORS FOR USE IN A DYNAMOELECTRIC MACHINEBackground of the InventionField of the InventionThis invention relates to inductor type dynamoelectric motors and, more specifically, to a support and positioning structure for conductors of a stator assembly of such a motor.Background ArtDynamoelectric machines are commonly used as motors for converting electrical to mechanical energy. Inductor type dynamoelectric motors may be used as adjustable speed drives for high speed operation. A dynamoelectric machine may also be used for electrical generation by driving its rotor in reverse thereby producing energy in the armature windings. Inductor type dynamoelectric machines are generally characterized by a stator which includes both AC armature and DC exitation coils surrounding a coil-less rotor. In this configuration, there are no rotating field or armature coils, slip rings, brushes and associated connections which are common to machines having rotating windings. Since inductor 

 type dynamoelectric machines contain fewer rotating parts they have a more rugged rotor construction and are particularly suitable for high speed application. One version of such an inductor type dynamoelectric machine, employs a circumferentially distributed arrangement of C-shaped armature elements surrounding a generally cylindrical field coil which in turn encloses a transverse pole magnetic rotor. U.S. Patent Nos. 437,501 and 2,519,697 and 3,912,958 describe earlier machines of this type of design. More recent versions of such inductor type machines are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Patent Nos. 4,786,834 and 4,864,176. In these patents, a spool-like support structure supporting field windings and armature elements is disclosed. The spool-like structure is made of a nonmagnetic material and has a hollow, elongated central portion extending concentrically about a longitudinal axis. This central portion supports a field coil and defines an interior longitudinal passageway for accommodating the insertion of a coaxial rotor. End portions are located at each end of the central portion and extend radially outward therefrom. Each of the end portions is preferably provided with radially oriented grooves in its axially outermost surface. The grooves are configured to receive and orient legs of generally C-shaped armature coil elements arranged in a circumferentially distributed pattern about the periphery of the spool-like structure. The armature elements are thereby positioned in three orthogonal
