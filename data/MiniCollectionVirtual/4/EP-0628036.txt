<DESCRIPTION>
 N-SUBSTITUTED-FURYLALKENYL HYDROXAMIC ACID AND N-HYDROXYUREA COMPOUNDS HAVING LIPOXYGENASE INHIBITORY ACTIVITYTechnical FieldThis invention relates to compounds having activity to inhibit lipoxygenase enzymes, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to a medical method of treatment. More particularly, this invention concerns certain substituted furanylalkenylene ureas and hydroxamic acids which inhibit leukotriene biosynthesis, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to a method of inhibiting lipoxygenase activity and leukotriene biosynthesis.Background of the Invention 5-Lipoxygenase is the first dedicated enzyme in the pathway leading to the biosynthesis of leukotrienes. This important enzyme has a rather restricted distribution, being found predominantly in leukocytes and mast cells of most mammals. Normally 5-liρoxygenase is present in the cell in an inactive form; however, when leukocytes respond to external stimuli, intracellular 5-lipoxygenase can be rapidly activated. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of molecular oxygen to fatty acids with cis,tis-\.A- pentadiene structures, converting them to l-hydroperoxy-tr /ts,cw-2,4-pentadienes. Arachidonic acid, die 5-lipoxygenase substrate which leads to leukotriene products, is found in very low concentrations in mammalian cells and must first be hydrolyzed from membrane phospholipids through the actions of phospholipases in response to extracellular stimuli. The initial product of 5-lipoxygenase action on arachidonate is 5- HPETE which can be reduced to 5-HETE or converted to LTA4. This reactive leukotriene intermediate is enzymatically hydrated to LTB4 or conjugated to the tripeptide glutathione to produce LTC4. LTA4 can also be hydrolyzed nonenzymatically to form two isomers of LTB4. Successive proteolytic cleavage steps convert LTC4 to LTD4 and LTE4. Other products resulting from further oxygenation steps have also been described in the literature. Products of the 5-lipoxygenase cascade are extremely potent substances which produce a wide variety of biological effects, often in the nanomolar to picomolar concentration range.The remarkable potencies and diversity of actions of products of the 5- lipoxygenase pathway have led to the suggestion that they play important roles in a variety of diseases. Alterations in leukotriene metabolism have been demonstrated in a number of disease states including asthma, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout, psoriasis, adult respiratory distress syndrome,
