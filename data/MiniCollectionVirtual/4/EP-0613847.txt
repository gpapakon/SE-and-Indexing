<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for sampling part 
of flat products carried by a conveyor according to the preamble 
of claim 1. The apparatus may be used for sampling one or a 
plurality of pieces of signatures continuously carried from a 
printing machine or the like by a conveyor. In the printing line, printed products continuously carried must 
be subjected to sampling for inspection. Conventionally, the 
sampling work has been manually performed by operators. It is 
desirable to mechanize the manual operation and to achieve the 
automatic sampling. An apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed 
in EP-A-0 326 532 and refers to drive means for opening and 
closing a clamp which may be of any design. A continuous chain 
is used which runs around three stationary deflection rolls. This 
chain is provided with a mechanical clamp and is disposed above 
the conveyor which conveys the flat products placed thereon in 
such a manner that this chain is adjacent and parallel to the 
conveyor.  
 EP-A-0 116 015 shows and describes in general an apparatus for 
sampling part of flat products having the following features: 
detecting a side end of flat products with a side end detecting 
means; descending a knife; inserting the knife under the flat 
products; clamping the flat products piled on the knife; and 
moving the knife at a velocity higher than the conveyor velocity. 
A gripper used therein remains stationary, when the springs are 
inserted under the sample copy and when the sample copy is 
clamped with the spring. When a member is disengaged the spring 
abruptly and rapidly descends onto the sample copy. Thus the 
spring contacts the sample copy abruptly and the sample copy may 
be damaged caused by this abrupt contact. Furtheron the rapid 
closing of the spring tends to cause damages to the flat product 
to be sampled, too. An object underlying the present invention is to overcome the 
above problems and to provide an apparatus for automatically 
sampling one or a plurality of pieces of flat products placed on 
a carrying conveyor and continuously carried. According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus 
of the kind referred to above as set out in claim 1. In the apparatus of the present invention the first unit is 
expandable and thus the inserting means can be moved in parallel 
with the conveyor by rotating the first arm unit around the arm 
shaft. Caused by this rotation of the first arm unit around the 
arm shaft the apparatus of the present
