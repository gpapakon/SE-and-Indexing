<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ignition coil assembly 
for internal combustion engines. Current conventional ignition coil assemblies for 
internal combustion engines, in particular those for 
vehicular applications, include a sizable steel laminated 
core and associated primary and secondary coil assemblies 
encased within a fairly thin electrically insulating 
thermoplastic housing. To mount or permanently fix the coil 
assembly to the engine or its environs, it is known to 
provide mounting holes through the core, and sometimes 
through the surrounding housing also, as is shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,763,094. This limits the options for placement 
of the coil assembly within the engine compartment. 
Specifically, the ignition coil assemblies mentioned above 
must be mounted on grounded surfaces to eliminate the 
possibility of electric shock. Further, it has been noted 
that the differences in thermal expansion coefficients 
between the housing and laminated core may give rise to 
stresses in the housing that can affect the waterproof 
integrity of the assembly and/or lead over time to the 
propagation of hairline fractures within the housing. In instances where the core laminations would otherwise 
be externally exposed, such as in the four tower coil design 
shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,763,094, it is also know to 
provide a soft water-proof layer of insulating tape or like 
material placed across the inner exposed surfaces of the 
C-shaped laminated cores. This is an expensive procedure to 
implement in actual mass production of the ignition coil 
assemblies. Utilisation of the water-proof tape also 
necessitates adding another operation to the manufacture of 
the ignition coil assembly on the production assembly line.  
 EP-A-0 395 513; EP-A-0 395 511 and EP-A-0 253 939 describe 
typical ignition coil assemblies. In EP-A-0 253 939 the 
sides of the primary core member locate directly in a keyway 
in the housing. However due to the effects of differing 
coefficients of expansion of the core and the housing, a 
tight fit of the core in the housing keyway could cause 
cracking of the housing during thermal cycling or during 
extended periods at elevated temperatures. EP-A-0 253 939 
discloses the use of a compressible element (30) in order to overcome 
expansion problems which may affect the waterproof integrity 
of the assembly. The present invention is directed to all the foregoing 
concerns. Further, the present invention is directed to 
providing flexibility of manufacturing techniques to allow 
the
