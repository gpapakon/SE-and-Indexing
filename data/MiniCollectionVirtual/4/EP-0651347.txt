<ABSTRACT>
A major factor of workloads for a user in a tape 
printing apparatus to execute a layout display is to 

confirm whether or not line end positions of the 
respective lines of an inputted sentence are aligned 

with each other. The inputted sentence is displayed 
at fixed positions for every line irrelevant to a print 

image (layout) along the main scanning direction, and 
also is displayed along the sub-scanning direction in 

such a layout manner that a mixed print image with a 
character portion and a background portion for every 

line is faithfully laid out and displayed (steps 102 to 
105). As a consequence, the print image process 

operations effected in the respective portions of a 
layout display apparatus can be made simple, and thus a 

high-speed layout display can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
layout display apparatus for displaying a print image
(layout) and, more particularly, is directed to a
layout display apparatus for a tape printing apparatus
capable of forming a label on which an inputted
sentence having one line or more is printed out.A tape printing apparatus prints out an inputted
character (conceptionally containing a symbol) string
having one line or more on a continuous tape, if
required, and also cuts the printed tape to be ejected
therefrom. This inputted character string will be
referred to as a "sentence". Recently, such a tape
printing apparatus capable of printing out not only the
sentence having 1 line, but also the sentence having
two lines or more on a cut tape (hereinafter referred
to as a "label") has been proposed, taking account of
such a fact that the label may be utilized in various
fields.Also in such a tape printing apparatus, like other
information processing apparatuses having printing
functions such as wordprocessors, a layout display 
apparatus for displaying a printed image is mounted.
Therefore, users may confirm the arrangement or the
like of the printing content of the label to be formed
by way of the layout display without printing out the
inputted sentence on the expensive tape, while
operating the layout display apparatus.On the other hand, the tape printing apparatuses
are made compact and lower in cost, as compared with
other information processing apparatuses, and moreover
may only display an entire portion or a part of a
sentence having several lines. Accordingly, the
display regions of the display units (for example,
liquid crystal displays) provided for the tape printing
apparatuses are typically small. Since the dot
number of the printing head influences
printing quality, the total dot number thereof should
be selected to be a sufficient value capable of
maintaining the required printing qualities. However,
in practice, the total dot number of the display unit
is limited because of the requirement
for compactness and low cost. For instance, even
when the total dot number of the printing head is
selected to be 62 dots or 96 dots, the size of the
display area of the display unit is selected to be
almost 16 dots (in a main scanning direction) X 48 dots
(in a sub-scanning direction), or 16 dots X 96 dots.
As to the tape functioning as the printing medium, the
length of this tape along the width direction (the main 
scanning direction) is fixed, whereas the length
thereof along the longitudinal direction

<CLAIMS>
A layout display apparatus for a tape printing apparatus, the tape
printing apparatus being for printing out a character string having more

than one line on a tape and for cutting the printed tape ejected
therefrom, said layout display apparatus comprising:


display means (35, 36) having a display area extending in a main
scanning direction corresponding to the width direction of a tape loaded

on the tape printing apparatus and extending in a sub-scanning direction
corresponding to the longitudinal direction of the tape loaded on the

tape printing apparatus,
determining means (21, 22a; 102) for determining

(a) a reduction rate along a sub-scanning direction, the reduction rate
being based on the width of the tape loaded on the tape printing

apparatus and the display width along the main scanning direction
in the display area;
(b) display positions in the main scanning direction on the display
area of respective lines of the character string running along the

sub-scanning direction on the basis of a predefined relationship
(22c) between a line number of the character string and

corresponding display positions in which respective lines of the
character string should be arranged, 
(c) for each character in each line of the character string a
predefined dot number, said dot number corresponds to the

length, in the sub-scanning direction, of a parallelogram
surrounding the corresponding character;
dot expansion means (21, 22a, 23a; 103) for expanding the respective
lines of input character string data to expanded dot patterns, the

expanded dot patterns being of a fixed dot number extent in the main
scanning direction, which is predetermined irrespective of the shape of

the respective characters, and of the dot number extent determined by
the determining means along the sub-scanning direction;
processing and storing means (21, 22a; 104) for

(a) reducing the dot patterns of the respective lines, expanded by the
dot expansion means, at the reduction rate determined by the

determining means,
(b) arranging the reduced dot patterns of the respective lines on the
respective display position as determined by the determining

means, and
(c) storing contents of the arranged and reduced dot patterns of the
respective lines into a display buffer (23b);

wherein the display means (35) is for displaying the contents of the
arranged and reduced dot patterns stored in the display buffer (23b) 
on
the display area.
A layout display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing and
storing means (21, 22a; 104) is further provided for:


(a) subdividing the expanded dot patterns of the respective lines along the
sub-scanning direction for every preselected dot number in accordance

with the reduction rate, to obtain subdivided dot pattern portions,
(b) converting each subdivided dot pattern portions into one dot to thereby
reduce the expanded dot patterns of the respective lines along the sub-scanning

direction, the converted one dot being represented as a character,
when there is at least one dot indicative of the character in the

subdivided dot pattern portion.
A layout display apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, further comprising:

a line number/display position converting table (22c) indicating the relationship
between the line number of the inputted character string and the display position

of the respective character string along the main scanning direction, the
determining means (21, 22; 102) including means for determining the display

positions of the respective lines of the character string along the main scanning 
direction with reference to the line number/display position converting table

(22c).
A layout display apparatus according any one of claims 1 to 3, further comprising
tape width detecting means (12; 100) for detecting the width of the tape

loaded on the tape printing apparatus, wherein the determining means determines
the reduction rate in accordance with the width of the tape determined

by the tape width detecting means (12; 100) and the display width along the
main scanning direction.
