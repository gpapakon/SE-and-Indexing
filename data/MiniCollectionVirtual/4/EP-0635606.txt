<ABSTRACT>
A skylight strip (1) for a roof (2) of an arcuate cross-section is arranged transversely with respect to the roof ridge and is formed by skylight panels (4) held in a frame (3). Said skylight strip (1) runs over the entire extent of the roof width or of the roof arc, with the result that its short sides or ends (5) help to form, or continue, the border (6) of the roof, as it were. The skylight panels (4) are configured, in the direction of the short dimension, that is to say in the direction of the roof ridge, with straight surface lines, that is to say they are not of an arched configuration, and are held, on the long borders, in a sealing clamping fit, with the result that heat movements are possible. A cutout, enclosed on all sides, within a roof, can thus be avoided because such a skylight strip (1) can be fitted between the borders of individual roof elements (13) in such a manner as to connect and span the same.

<CLAIMS>
A roof (2) of arched cross section, including a
skylight strip (1), whereby the long side of the

skylight strip (1) consisting of at least one
skylight panel (4) held in a frame (3) extends

throughout the extent of the arched cross section of
the roof, the short side(s) (5) of the skylight strip

(1) jointly forms or continues the edge (6) of the
roof (2) and at least those edges (7) of the skylight

panel (4) which extend in the direction of the arch
are held in a sealing press fit, 
characterized in
that
 the skylight strip (1) has straight surface
lines in the direction of its short side or dimension

and parallel to the roof ridge, and that the skylight
panel (4) is one-piece or interrupted once and is

sealed and held by a cover (9) or cover strip
overlying the gap (8).
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the skylight panel (4) is

interrupted at the roof ridge.
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, characterized in that arranged in the course

of the skylight strip, particularly in the region of
an interruption in the skylight panel (4) or in the

ridge area of the roof, there is an openable folding
light (23), skylight panels departing from the

boundary of said folding light and extending in
either direction toward the roof edge.
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the press fit

for the skylight panels (4) is provided at a frame 
(3) projecting upwards relative to the roof level and

following the curvature of the roof, the skylight
panel (4) resting on the top side of said frame,

particularly with a seal (14) inbetween, and for its
part being peripherally held by a clamping profile

(15) applied to it again from above.
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 4,
characterized in that the clamping profile (15) is

screwed together with the frame (3) in the position
of use and that the clamping screws (17) pass at the

side of the edge of the skylight panel (4) or through
elongated holes situated in the light panel and

oriented in the direction of thermal expansion.
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that directly

adjacent to the frame (3), a cover plate (16) for
underlying insulating material (18) is provided at

the top side of the roof (2), one flange (19) of said
cover plate extending to the top side of the frame

(3), and that the top side of said flange (19)
constitutes the rest for the skylight panel (4) on

the frame (3).
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that arranged beneath

the skylight panel(s) (4) are cross members (10)
extending in spaced relationship to one another in

the direction of the minor dimension of the skylight
panels (4), in the normal position there being

between said cross members and the skylight panel (4)
a clearance smaller than the elastic deformability of

the skylight panels (4) under pressure due to wind,
snow load or the like. 
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that the clearance between the cross

member (10) and the skylight panel (4) is provided
with at least one supporting buffer (20),

particularly of elastic material, whose extent is
smaller than that of the cross member (10).
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 7 or
claim 8, characterized in arranged between the cross

member (10) and the skylight strip (1) are a
plurality of spaced supporting buffers (20), for

example three or four supporting buffers (20),
disposed over the length of the cross member (10) and

breadth of the skylight strip (1).
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 9,
characterized in that the mutual spacing of the

supporting buffers (20) is approximately the spacing
between the edge and the supporting buffer (20)

closest thereto.
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in any one of
claims 7 to 10, characterized in that the cross

members (10) are fastened, e.g. welded or screwed, to
the frame (3) for the skylight panels (4) with a

butt-joint or by way of flanges.
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 11, characterized in that above the

skylight strip (1) or light panels (4) braces (21)
are provided which extend in spaced relationship to

one another in the direction of the minor dimension
of the skylight strip (1) and which are at a

clearance from the top side of the skylight panels 
(4), said clearance being smaller than the elastic

deformability under the suction effect during wind or
stor
m.
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 12,
characterized in that the braces (21) extend directly

above the cross members (10), so that each skylight
panel (4) is held on either side between cross member

(10) and brace (21).
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in claim 12 or
claim 13, characterized in that supporting buffers

(20) or the like are arranged between the brace (21)
and the skylight panels (4).
A roof with skylight strip as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that that

portion of the holding frame (3) which extends in the
direction of the roof arch is tightly joined and

secured to edges of roof elements (13) consisting of
metal or concrete.
