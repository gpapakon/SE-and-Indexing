<ABSTRACT>
A belt used as a rope which as a strength higher than that of a rope of the same mass and a substantially 
circular cross section, and which is provided at both sides thereof with belt portions. This belt consists of a narrow 

woven material (10) composed of warp and weft yarn (6, 7) of synthetic fiber filaments, and has a belt body (2) 
extending in the lengthwise direction of the belt, a belt portion (4), and a joint portion (3) for connecting the belt body 

(2) and belt portion (4) together. The belt body (2) is formed by weaving core strings (5) into a hollow weave texture, 
and the warp yarn density factor of a hollow weave member (22) is set to not more than 0.700. The belt portion (4) 

has a woven structure in which the warp yarn (6) in the hollow weave member of the belt body (2) and a part or the 
whole of the core strings (5) in the belt body (2) are interlaced with the weft yarn. The belt portion has a width W 

not less than 2.0 times as large as that 
W
 of the belt body (2). The joint portion (3) is formed so that it transmutes 
to a woven structure of the belt body (2) or that of the belt portion (4) in a plurality of steps with its weaving width 

gradually decreasing or increasing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a belt-like woven fabric 
which can replace ropes used as a safety belts for work 
done in high places and ropes used as slings for flexible 
containers, and so forth. Generally, a safety belt for work done in high 
places has a construction wherein one of the ends of a 
rope is fitted to a metal member disposed in a safety 
belt and a hook or a carabiner is fitted on the other end 
thereof. In the sling of a flexible container, a rope is 
connected to a metal member fitted to the main body of 
the container. To connect the rope to the metal member, 
it is customary to conduct so-called "Satsuma" 
processing, i.e., a Japanese term representing an 
operation to piece together two ends of rope manually. 
This processing requires a high level of skill and 
strength. Accordingly, it has become difficult in recent 
years to secure such skilled labor. In the case of 
narrow woven fabrics, connection by sewing can be easily 
accomplished. However, because they are relatively wide, 
belt-like woven fabrics are inferior to rope in the 
aspect of handling, and have therefore not been employed. A prior art reference disclosing a structure 
analogous to that of the present invention is Japanese 
Examined Utility Model Publication (Kokoku) No. 62-14137 
entitled "Narrow Woven Fabric". This includes a narrow 
width flat woven structure 81 and a circular woven 
structure 82. When warps 83 at a peripheral portion are 
woven by wefts 85 in the circular woven structure 82, 
part of the warps 84 are used as core yarns, i.e., 
wadding yarns (see fig. 6). However, this prior art reference is substantially 
different from the construction of the present invention  
 
in the following points, and this technology cannot be 
employed for the object of the present invention. As 
described in the specification of this prior art 
reference, "a part of warps 84 is removed from the woven 
structure and weaving is done in such a manner that the 
number of warps to be woven is smaller on the inside of 
the woven structure than on the peripheral side thereof". 
The prior art does not weave the wadding yarns in a total 
denier number of at least 1.5 times the total denier 
number of the warps of the hollow woven structure as is 
done in the present invention. As will be later 
described, the wadding yarns to be woven into the hollow 
woven structure in the present invention must have at 
least the volume described above, and if the volume is 
smaller, the inside of the hollow woven structure will 
have a large

<CLAIMS>
A rope substitution belt (1) having a main body 
portion (2), a belt portion (4) and a connecting portion (3) for 

connecting said main body portion to said belt portion, 
each being disposed in a predetermined length in a 

longitudinal direction of said belt, as a narrow width 
woven fabric constituted by warp yarns (6) and weft yarns (7) of 

synthetic fiber filaments, characterized in that said 
main body portion (2) has a structure in which wadding yarns (5) 

are woven into a hollow woven structure (22), the total denier 
number of said wadding yarns (5) is so constituted as to be 

at least 1.5 times the total denier number of said warps (6) 
of said hollow woven structure portion (22), said hollow woven 

structure portion (22) has a warp density coefficient of not greater than 
0.700, said belt portion (4) has a woven structure in which a 

part or all of said wadding yarns (5) of said main body 
portion (2) are so arranged as to cross said weft yarns (7) with 

said warp yarns (6) of said hollow woven structure portion (22) of 
said main body portion (2), said belt portion (4) has a width of 

at least 2.0 times the width of said main body portion (2), 
and said connecting portion (3) is constituted in such a 

manner that while a width of the woven structure thereof 
is gradually changed, the woven structure thereof shifts 

step-wise over a plurality of stages, to the woven 
structure of said main body portion (2) or the woven 

structure of said belt portion (4). 
A rope substitution belt according to claim 1, 
wherein at least said main body portion (2) is subjected to 

molding process by using a heat-treatment apparatus 
having an appropriate mold.
