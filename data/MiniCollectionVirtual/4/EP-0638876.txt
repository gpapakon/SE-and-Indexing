<ABSTRACT>
Method for controlling a mobile machine, such as in particular a travelling crane (1) including a framework (4, 5, 8, 9, 20) which can be moved in a translational motion along runway tracks (2, 3) on which are arranged lifting means (13). According to the invention:   - parameters characteristic of the mobile machine are recorded, giving a picture of the loads, deformations and energy expended at a given instant,   - at least the same parameters are measured in the active phase, - a correlation is established between these measurements, and the result of the measurements in the active phase is compared with this correlation so as to record the objective time derivatives of the parameters.   The subject of the invention is also a device for the implementation of the method.

Process for monitoring an overhead travelling crane (1), comprising
a frame constituted by two girders (4, 5) interconnected by at least one beam

(8, 9), the said overhead travelling crane (1) being capable of being
displaced in a translational movement along travelling path lines (2, 3), on

which crane are provided hoisting means (13), characterised in that :

there are recorded characteristic parameters of the said overhead
travelling crane (1) giving an image of the stresses, deformations and energy

consumed at a given moment, by measuring at least the stresses present in
the girders (4, 5), the deformations in a horizontal and a vertical plane of the

angle between the beam (8, 9) and the girders (4, 5), and the strength of
current of the motors (7) driving the girders (4, 5);
at least the same parameters are measured, in the active phase,
when the overhead travelling crane (1) bears given loads ;
a correlation is established between these measurements ;
with this correlation, the results of the measurements in the active
phase are compared in order to record the objective drift values for the

parameters over a period of time.

measurements are carried out in the active phase in the course of the

accelerations and decelerations of the overhead travelling crane (1).

is provided a representation in graph form of the variations in time of the of

the parameters measured and a selection of reference events on these
graphs.
Monitoring process according to claim 1, characterised in that
provision is made for storage of the information measured in order to follow

the evolution of the parameters in time according to a determined sequence.
Device for implementing the process, described above, of
monitoring an overhead travelling crane (1), according to claim 1, comprising

a frame constituted by two girders (4, 5) interconnected by at least one beam
