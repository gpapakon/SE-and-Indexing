<ABSTRACT>
A lens projector is provided for use with a lens blocking 
device (10) having an LCD target display plane (21) disposed beneath a 

work surface (17) and a tower (13) having an upper portion extending 
above the work surface with a eyepiece (60) therethrough. The lens 

projector includes a bracket (40) fixed to the tower proximate the 
eyepiece with a light source (31) rigidly seated on the bracket 

above the work surface. A viewer mounted in the eyepiece is 
aligned on a sight line substantially normal to and centered 

on the work center of the LCD target display plane. An at 
least partially transmissive mirror (77) intersects the sight line 

and is fixed to the viewer at an angle such that light emitted 
from a center of the light source is reflected along the sight 

line toward the work surface so as to project an image of a 
multi-focal segment or a lens marking onto the graphic 

display. A shield (90) fixed to the bracket and extending between 
the light source and the tower protects the tower from heat 

dissipated by the light source. The projector light source is 
preferably a high intensity lamp connected to the electrical 

power source of the blocking device. A switch responsive to 
operation of a key on a keyboard of the blocking device 

controls the operation of the lamp and a timer automatically 
disconnects the lamp from the power source after a preselected 

period of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical equipment and 
more particularly concerns apparata for projecting a lens 
blank on a lens blocker. In US Patent No. 5283980, a lens blocker was disclosed for 
use in applying a block on a lens blank in preparation for 
mounting on a edger. In using this and other types of lens 
blockers, it is sometimes desirable to project an image of a 
low power add of a multi-focal segmented lens on the LCD 
alignment screen target. It is further sometimes desirable to 
project or reflect the lay-out markings of a progressive lens 
as an image on the LCD alignment screen target. Similarly, 
projection of invisible or blended bifocals may also be 
desirable. Most presently known lens projecting devices using LCDs 
accomplish the projection of low power adds, progressives and 
bifocals by use of a back light. In a back light arrangement, 
a lamp beneath the work surface illuminates a lens disposed 
between the work surface and the light source. Casting the 
image on the LCD surface with the work area above and the lens 
below has several draw backs. Since the LCD must be 
transparent, a unique LCD is required. Manipulation and 
alignment of the lens becomes difficult because manipulation 
occurs below the work surface while viewing occurs above the 
work surface and because the components of the blocker 
apparatus limit the hand movements of the operator. Moreover, 
the blocker apparatus so constricts space in the area where 
the lens must be placed that it is physically impossible to 
insert, much less manipulate, thicker lenses. One known 
projecting device deals with the above mentioned orientation 
problems by placing the lens above the work surface rather 
than beneath it but this imposes limitations on the viewing of  
 
low power multi-focal segments. In an attempt to overcome 
these limitations, edge lighting is used, but is ineffective 
in highlighting the multi-focal segments. Furthermore, edge 
lighting cannot be used to project the image of a dark lens or 
markings thereon. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide 
a lens projecting device which projects an accurately defined 
image on an LCD surface. It is a further object of this 
invention to provide a lens projecting device which projects 
an image on an LCD work surface which is accurate when 
observed from any position above the LCD surface. It is 
another object of this invention to provide a lens projecting 
device which permits manipulation of the lens above the work 
surface of a lens
