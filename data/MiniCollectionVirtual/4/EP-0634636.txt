<ABSTRACT>
In a Michelson-type interferometer, two plane mirrors of the mirror unit (50) are designed as two plane mirrors (51, 52) of different size, arranged eccentrically and parallel to each other. In addition, a hollow shaft (63) is provided, supported rotatably in a bearing block (62) and driven by a drive unit (65), the said hollow shaft (63) being arranged between a beam splitter and the mirror unit (50) and its axis of rotation (61) coinciding with the axis of rotation of the mirror unit (50). Here, the mirror unit (50) is fixed to the hollow shaft (63) in such a way that the axis of rotation (61) of the hollow shaft runs through the mirror surface of the smaller plane mirror (51) and, with the vertical to the smaller plane mirror (51), forms an acute angle (ss), with the result that the two ray bundles formed at the beam splitter (1) impinge on the centrally arranged mirror surface of the smaller plane mirror (51) via the deflection mirror through the hollow shaft (63), are reflected from the said mirror surface of the smaller plane mirror (51) to the opposite mirror surface of the larger plane mirror (52) and from there are reflected onto two fixed plane mirrors (71, 72) in such a way that they impinge vertically on the fixed plane mirrors (71, 72) and - reflected from the latter - run along the same path in the reverse direction, recombine at the beam splitter and are focused by means of an optical element on the detector (4).

A Michelson interferometer, having

a beam splitter (1),
a focusing optical element (3),
a detector (4) for detecting the signal radiation,
a mirror unit which can be set into rotation by a drive unit and has two
mutually parallel mirror surfaces, facing one another at a predetermined distance

of plane mirrors, by way of which both beams formed at the beam splitter (1) can
be directed in order to change the path length,
a third and a forth plane mirror (71
3
, 72
3
), which are disposed on different,
opposed sides of a plane which is located in the extension of the center plane of

the beam splitter (1) plane and at right angle to the beams arriving from the beam
splitter (1),
a laser as a radiation source, and
a laser detector,

characterized in that

the mirror surfaces of the mirror unit (50
3
; 50
4
; 50
5
) are circular or elliptical plan
mirrors (51
3
, 52
3
, 51
4
, 52
4
, 51
5
, 52
5
), have the same diameter, and are secured to
one another at an adjustable spacing (a) ;
with respect to the center plane of the mirror element, the beam splitter (1) is
disposed on one side and the third and forth plan mirrors (71
3
, 72
3
) are disposed
on the other side of the mirror unit (50
3
; 50
4
; 50
5
) in such a way that the beam
splitter plane is located between the plane mirrors (51
3
, 52
3
, 51
4
, 52
4
, 51
5
, 52
5
) of
the mirror unit (50
3
; 50
4
; 50
5
) and bisects the angle formed by third and fourth
plane mirrors (71
3
, 72
3
);
the surfaces of the plane mirror unit (50
3
; 50
4
; 50
5
) are inclined by a small angle
(α) relative to the vertical to the axis of rotation (8
3
; 8
4
; 8
5
) of the mirror unit (50
3
;
50
4
; 50
5
), and
the axis of rotation (8
3
; 8
4
; 8
5
) of the mirror unit (50
3
; 50
4
; 50
5
) coincides with that
of a drive shaft (80
3
; 80
4
; 80
5
), which is secured to the outside of one of the two 
plane mirrors (52
3
; 52
4
; 52
5
 and 51
3
; 51
4
; 51
5
, respectively) of the mirror unit (50
3
;
50
4
; 50
5
), and which is drivable by a motor at a constant angular speed, so that
an incident beam (10) is divided by the beam splitter (1) into two halves of equal

intensity, each of the beam halves strike one of the two plane mirrors (51
3
; 51
4
;
51
5
 and 52
3
, 52
4
, 52
5
, respectively), are reflected to the respectively opposed
plane mirror (52
3
, 52
4
, 52
5
, and 51
3
; 51
4
; 51
5
 respectively) and from there finally to
the third and fourth mirrors (71
3
, 72
3
), in such a way that they strike these mirrors
(71
3
, 72
3
) vertically, from there travel the path described in the reverse direction,
are recombined at the beam splitter (1), and are carried to the detector (4) via the

focusing lens (3), the path difference being adjustable by means of the
magnitudes of the angle (α) and spacing (a).
Interferometer according to claim 1, characterized in that the two plane mirrors
(51
4
, 52
4
) of the mirror unit (50
4
) are each provided with a central bore, through
which the drive shaft (80
4
) is guided, which shaft is secured via two flanges (81,
82) to the respective outer faces of the mirrors (51
4
, 52
4
) in such a way that the
plane mirrors (51
4
, 52
4
) are inclined by the angle (α) relative to the vertical to the
axis of rotation (8
4
), and the diameter of the incident beam (10), the beam splitter
(1), the mirror element (50
4
), and third and fourth mirrors (71
3
, 72
3
) are
dimensioned and disposed in such a way that the beams (10', 10"), which are

concentric to their optical axis, in each rotational position pass through only half of
the mirror unit (50
4
) unhindered by the drive shaft (80
4
).
Interferometer according to claim 2, characterized in that the diameter of the
incident beam (10), the beam splitter (1), the mirror unit (50
4
), and the third and
fourth plane mirrors (71
3
, 72
3
) are dimensioned and disposed such that the beams
(10', 10"), which are concentric to their optical axes and originate from the incident

beam (10), travel through the arrangement in such a way that the optical axes of
the beam halves (10', 10") form a plane with the axis of rotation (8
4
), and the drive
shaft (80
4
) as a result shields only a central portion of the beam. 
Interferometer according to claim 1, characterized in that the two plane mirrors
(51
5
, 52
5
) of the mirror unit (50
5
) are fixed parallel to one another at the distance
(a) on opposed sides with two U-shaped retaining elements (93, 94)

encompassing them,

concentrically with the back side of one of the two plane mirrors (51
5
, 52
5
) of the
mirror unit (50
5
), a drive shaft (80
5
) is secured via a flange (81
5
), the axis of
rotation (85) of the drive shaft forming the small angle (α) with the vertical to the

mirror faces of the plane mirrors (51
5
, 52
5
), and
the U-shaped retaining elements (93, 94) are dimensioned such that despite the
shading of the beam effected by the retaining elements (93, 94) upon rotation of

the mirror unit (50
5
) an angle of at least 120° each is available twice per revolution
for unhindered operation,
so that the path length, established in the interferometer by means of the third and
fourth plane mirrors (71
3
, 72
3
), are coordinated with one another such that from
the course of the sinusoidally modulated path change, the segments usable for

the measurement, of twice 120°, are located symmetrically to both sides of the
turning point of the sinusoidal curve and thus in the virtually linear region thereof,
so that as a result approximately 87% of the entire optical difference and
approximately 67% of the entire time of one revolution are usable for a

measurement.
