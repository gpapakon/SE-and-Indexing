<ABSTRACT>
The circuit comprises a first and a second voltage-controlled 
oscillator (4, 14) having identical 

characteristics. The first oscillator (4) is incorporated 
into a frequency synthesis loop (3) in such a way as to 

oscillate, in response to a first control voltage (V₁), at 
a frequency equal to a reference frequency multiplied by a 

number N. The second voltage-controlled oscillator (14) is 
incorporated into a phase tracking loop (13) which, when it 

is activated, locks its oscillation phase relative to that 
of the received data signal (SD). The second oscillator (14) 

delivers the recovered clock signal (CLK₂). A comparator 
(20) determines whether the frequency of the second 

oscillator (14), divided by N, satisfies the condition of 
not deviating from the reference frequency by more than a 

predetermined limit value. The phase tracking loop (13) is 
activated only when the said condition is satisfied, and the 

first control voltage (V₁) is fed to the control input of 
the second oscillator when the said condition is not 

satisfied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clock recovery
circuit for synchronizing the reception of a serial digital
transmission.For the synchronous (or even asynchronous)
transmission of a serial digital data signal, the sending
unit includes a generator of a serial clock signal used for
coding and serializing the data. So as to synchronize
correctly the decoding and deserializing of the received
data, the receiving unit must also include a clock signal
generator, the value of the frequency of which is a faithful
image of the actual line bit-rate on the transmission
channel. The clock signal generator of the receiving unit
comprises a phase-locked loop (PLL) whose voltage-controlled
oscillator provides a clock signal reproducing the frequency
of the bit rate of the received data signal. Usually, the
coding of the data is of NRZ or NRZI type, which, apart from
the advantage of producing a signal having a minimum useful
passband and a stable line mean value, achieves a sizeable
density of transitions so as to facilitate phase-locking on
reception. However, sequences may survive during which the
signal received exhibits few transitions, making phase-locking
on reception very difficult or even impossible.
Since the pull-in range of this locking is then directly
proportional to the density of transitions of the data
signal received, it is seen that it is necessary for the
voltage-controlled oscillator to oscillate at an initial
frequency very similar to that to be extracted.It is appreciated that it is difficult to construct
a voltage-controlled oscillator having characteristics
specified with a high degree of accuracy. The variations
resulting from the manufacturing process and the in-service
temperature variations introduce an uncertainty as regards
the precise values of the characteristic parameters. On the 
other hand, integration techniques make it possible to
construct, within the same integrated circuit, two
oscillators having very similar characteristics.This well-known principle has already been exploited
in order to construct clock recovery circuits using two
integrated and identical oscillators, by the master and
slave technique. For example, the article "A BiCMOS
Receive/Transmit PLL Pair for Serial Data Communication" by
B.L. Thompson and H.S. Lee, published in Proc. of the IEEE
Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 1992, pages 29.6.1-29.6.5,
describes a circuit containing matched master and
slave oscillators. The master oscillator forms part of a
frequency synthesis loop. Its output frequency,
