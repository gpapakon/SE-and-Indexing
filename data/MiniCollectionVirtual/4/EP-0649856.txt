<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a biologically active and correctly 
folded protein, using a protein disulfide exchange enzyme and a redox system containing a 
sulfhydryl and a disulfide compound. Correct folding of genetically engineered proteins is a major issue in protein science. The 
problem is particularly acute in the case of disulfide-containing proteins, which often need 
to be denatured and refolded to become active. Disulfide formation is an event of 
post-translational modification. It follows the pathway of protein folding and usually 
occurs faithfully in vivo. However, in the in vitro renaturation experiments, many proteins 
are recovered in poor yields and some do not fold into native structures at all. To 
overcome this problem, a number of compounds, such as the mixture of reduced / oxidized 
glutathione (Creighton, Methods Enzymol. 131 (1986), 83-106) and protein disulfide 
isomerase (PDI) (Morin, J. E. & Dixon, J. E. Methods Enzymol. 113 (1985), 541-547) 
have been routinely used to promote the formation of disulfides. But despite their 
widespread use, the precise mechanism of their function remains undefined and their 
applications have been conducted in a manner of trial and error. Therefore, the 
efficiencies of in vitro folding documented so far are nowhere near those observed in vivo. A number of publications have appeared which report refolding attempts for individual 
proteins produced in bacterial hosts, or which are otherwise in a denatured or non-native 
form. Formation of a dimeric, biologically active human colony stimulating factor-1 
(CSF-1) after expression in E. coli is described in WO 88/8003 and by Halenbeck et al. 
Biotechnologie, 7 (1989), 710-715. The procedures described involve the steps of initial 
solubilization of CSF-1 monomers isolated from inclusion bodies under reducing 
conditions in a chaotropic environment comprising urea or guanidine hydrochloride, 
refolding which is achieved by stepwise dilution of the chaotropic agents, and final 
oxidation of the refolded molecule in the presence of a redox-system. In WO 88/8849 a 
process for recovering recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) is disclosed, characterized in that 
IL-2 isolated from refractile bodies is denatured under reducing conditions with 6 M 
guanidine hydrochloride, the soluble IL-2 is oxidized by a controlled oxidation in the  
 
presence of Cu²⁺ions, and the oxidized IL-2 refolded by reducing the concentration of the 
denaturant in the solution. Interleukin-2 and
