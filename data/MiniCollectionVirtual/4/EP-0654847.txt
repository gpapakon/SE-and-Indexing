<ABSTRACT>
An electrical contact element comprises a connecting 
part for an electrical conductor with an insulating sheath. 

The connecting part is provided with an inlet slot at its free 
end. The width of the inlet slot is at least equal to the 

diameter of the electrical conductor but smaller than the 
diameter of the insulating sheath.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical contact 
element, comprising a connecting part for an electrical 
conductor with an insulating sheath, in particular a contact 
element of the type for use with conductors of shielded 
cables. EP-A-0 536 849 discloses a connector with contact 
elements, wherein the characteristics of the plastic material 
of the insulating sheath of the electrical conductors is 
advantageously used for removing the insulating sheath of the 
electrical conductors. As this material is relatively soft, 
the insulating sheath can easily be shoved on the electrical 
conductor, whereby the free end of the conductor is exposed. 
In the known connector a stop for the insulating sheath is 
mounted in the connector, said stop holding the insulating 
sheath when the conductor is shoved into the connector, 
whereby the conductor is exposed on the connecting part of the 
corresponding contact element. Although by this embodiment of 
the connector the conductors of the cable to be connected are 
exposed in a simple manner, the construction of the connector 
should meet high requirements as the stop must be located at 
an accurately predetermined position with respect to the 
connecting part, while the conductors with the insulating 
sheath should be led to the connecting part and the stop in an 
accurate manner. The invention aims to provide an electrical contact 
element which is made in a simple manner and when used in for 
example connectors for shielded cables does not call for 
further requirements for the connector for removing the 
insulating sheath of the conductor to be connected. To this end the electrical contact element of the 
invention is characterized in that the connecting part is 
provided with an inlet slot at its free end, wherein the width 
of the inlet slot is at least equal to the diameter of the 
electrical conductor but smaller than the diameter of the 
insulating sheath. In this manner the connecting part of the contact 
element itself is advantageously used as stop for the  
 
insulating sheath, said stop being automatically located at 
the correct position with respect to the electrical conductor. The invention will be further explained hereinafter 
by reference to the drawings, in which two embodiments of the 
electrical contact element of the invention are shown. Fig. 1 shows a module of a connector which is 
provided with electrical contacts according to a first 
embodiment of the invention. Fig. 2 shows the module of Fig. 1, wherein the 
electrical conductors of
