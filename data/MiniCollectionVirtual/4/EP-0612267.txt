<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a filter with a reaction chamber (10) which is filled with fresh reagent by a first star feeder (2) and from which the spent reagent is removed by a second star feeder (3). The feeders (2, 3) are inserted as partitions in a tube (1) so that the space (10) between the feeders (2, 3) is the reaction chamber, the space (11) above the first feeder (2) is a reservoir for fresh reagent and the space (12) below the second feeder (3) is a discharge chamber for spent reagent. The main field of application of the invention is the analysis of gases.

Filter for cleaning fluid streams, with a reaction 
space (10) equipped with an inlet port (17) for the fluid to 

be cleaned and an outlet port (18) for the cleaned fluid as 
well as a first star wheel valve (2) through which fresh reagent 

is supplied and a second star wheel valve (3) for evacuation 
of exhausted reagent, characterized by the two star wheel 

valves (2, 3) being installed in a tube (1) with constant 
cross section over its length in such a manner that the axis 

of rotation of the star wheel valves (2, 3) lies in the tube 
axis and that the tube interior is subdivided into three 

spaces, namely the reaction space (10) between the star wheel 
valves (2, 3), a storage space (11) adjacent to the first 

star wheel valve (2) and closed by means of a detachable 
lid (16), and a waste space (12) adjacent to the second star 

wheel valve (3) and closed by means of a detachable lid (15), 
and by the inlet port (17) and the outlet port (18) being provided 

at the tube wall. 
Filter as claimed in 1, with the star wheel valves (2, 3) 
driven by a motor (14) via a joint axle (13). 
Filter as claimed in 2, with the cell of the second-valve 
(3) being smaller than that of the first valve (2). 
Filter as claimed in 2 or 3, with stirring pins (19, 20) 
attached to the axle (13) in the reaction space (10) and/or in 

the storage space (11), preferably immediately above the respective 
star wheel valve (2, 3). 
Filter as claimed in one of claims 1 through 4, with the 
inlet port (17) and the outlet port (18) provided on opposed 

sides of the reaction space (10). 
Filter as claimed in one of claims 1 through 5, with the 
inlet port provided in the vicinity of the second valve (3) 

and the outlet port in the vicinity of the first valve (2).  
 
Filter as claimed in one of claims 2 through 6, with a 
filler connection provided adjacent to the storage space (11) 

at a given angle, through the lateral wall of which storage 
space the driving axle (13) is routed. 
Filter as claimed in one of claims 2 through 7, with at 
least one heater provided on the tube in the area of the reaction 

space (10). 
Filter as claimed in 8, with the tube (1) being thermally 
insulated.
