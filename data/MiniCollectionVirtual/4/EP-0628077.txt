<ABSTRACT>
A33 antigen binding proteins are described for use in the diagnosis or treatment of colorectal tumours and metastases arising therefore. The binding protein may be a humanised A33 antibody, incl uding complete antibody molecules, fragments thereof, and, especially, multivalent monospecific proteins comprising two, three, four or more antibodies or fragments thereof bound to each other by a cross-linking agent. For diagnosis or therapy the humanised A33 antibody may be linked to a reporter or effector molecule.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antibody molecules having specificity for the
epitope recognised by the murine monoclonal antibody A33, to processes
for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and
to their use in medicine.The murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) A33, is an IgG2a/k which
recognises a heat-stable, protease-resistant neuraminidase-resistant
epitope which is homogeneously expressed in virtually all primary and
metastatic colon cancers. The expression of the antigen is restricted to
normal colonic mucosal epithelium and colonic carcinoma and it is not
shed into the circulation (Welt et al., 1990). The antigen is expressed on a
number of human tumour cell lines, including ASPC-1 and Colo205.The A33 antibody intemalises after binding to antigen. It has been shown
to localise to tumours in vivo in patients with hepatic metastases of
colorectal carcinoma (Welt et al., 1990). 131I labelled antibody (0.2mg.,
n=3; 2mg., n=8; 10mg. n=3; 25mg, n=3; 50mg, n=3; labelled with 2-5
mCi) was administered i.v. to 20 patients 7-8 days prior to surgery.
Selective mAb33 localisation to tumour tissue was demonstrated in 19 of
the 20 patients. One week after administration tumour/liver ratios ranged
from 6.9 to 100 while tumour/serum ratios ranged from 4.1 to 25.2.
Studies with a control 125I MAb Ta99 (2 mg. dose, co-administered to
three patients who received 2mg. A33), showed that the tumour uptake of
A33 was specific, with 2.3 to 45 fold higher uptake for A33.However a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response was detected
in patients as early as day 7 in 8 patients and all patients developed a
HAMA response by day 30. Initially the predominant HAMA was IgM but 
by day 30 IgG responses were also detected. The HAMA reactivity was
not, however, restricted to the IgG2a isotype. Murine IgG1 and IgG3
could also be detected with patient serum. It can therefore be expected
that the usefulness of the murine MAb A33 as a therapeutic agent in
humans will be limited by the fact that the human subject will mount an
immunological response to the MAb and will either remove it entirely or at
least reduce its effectiveness.Proposals have been made for making non-human MAbs less antigenic in
humans. Such techniques can be generically termed "humanisation"
techniques. These techniques generally involve the use of recombinant
DNA technology to manipulate DNA sequences encoding the polypeptide
chains of the antibody molecule. A simple form of humanisation involves
the replacement of the constant regions of the
