<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a forehardened silver halide radio-graphic 
element comprising (1) silver halide tabular grain emulsion layer(s) and 
(2) antistatic layer(s) comprising a colloidal vanadium oxide compound and a 
sulfopolyester compound. Tabular silver halide grains are crystals possessing two major faces that 
are substantially parallel. The average diameter of said faces is at least three 
times the distance separating them (the thickness). This is generally described 
in the art as an aspect ratio of at least 3:1. Silver halide photographic emulsions containing a high proportion of tabular 
grains have advantages of good developability, improved covering power 
and increased useful adsorption of sensitizing dye per weight of silver due to 
their high surface area-to-volume ratio. The use of such emulsions in photographic 
elements is disclosed in US Pat. Nos. 4,425,425, 4,425,426, 4,433,048, 
4,435,499, 4,439,520, and other related patents. The use of automatic processors for the rapid processing (i.e., for a 
processing of from 45 to 90 sec) of light-sensitive silver halide elements including 
tabular silver halide grains, in particular light-sensitive silver halide elements 
for radiographic use, is known. Such elements generally include a support 
(usually provided with a very thin subbing layer) having coated on at least one 
side thereof a silver halide gelatin emulsion layer coated in turn with a gelatin 
protective layer. These elements are transported through the machine processing 
units (developing, fixing, washing and drying) by means of opposed or 
staggered rollers (as described, for example, in US Pat. No. 3,025,779) which 
also have the function of squeezing liquid from the film prior to drying. In recent 
years the increased use of silver halide elements for radiography has led to a 
strong request for a reduction of processing times. If rapid processing of a film  
 
takes place, several problems can occur, such as an inadequate image density 
(i.e. insufficient sensitivity, contrast and maximum density), insufficient fixing, insufficient 
washing, and insufficient film drying. Insufficient fixing and washing of 
a film cause a progressive worsening of the image quality and modification of 
the silver tone. In order to reduce the time taken by the element to pass through 
the processing machine from 2 to 0.5 minutes, as particularly required in rapid 
processing of radiographic elements, the processing is performed at relatively 
higher temperatures, usually higher
