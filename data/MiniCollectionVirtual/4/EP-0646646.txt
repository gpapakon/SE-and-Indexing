<ABSTRACT>
An expression system for producing and isolating large 
quantities of protein. This system empl
oys an expression vector, 
comprising (a) a coding region for a glutathione-binding 

polypeptide (glutathione-s-transferase preferred), operatively 
connected to a promoter, (b) a second coding region in-frame with 

the first coding region, and (c) at least one restriction site between 
the first and second coding regions wherein a fusion protein of the 

first and second coding regions will result from expression of the 
vector. This vector is used in a host cell, which in turn is used in a 

process for isolating and purifying a protein. This process 
comprises (a) treating the host cell under conditions allowing 

expression of the vector, whereby a fusion protein of the first and 
second coding regions will be expressed; (b) exposing proteins 

from the host cell to glutathione resin, whereby the fusion protein 
will adhere to the resin; and (c) cleaving the expression product of 

the second coding region from the resin. Also described is a 
process for expressing a nucleic acid sequence, which comprises 

(a) inserting the nucleic acid sequence into a baculovirus 
expression vector in-frame with the first coding region; (b) placing 

the vector into a host cell; (c) treating the host cell under conditions 
allowing expression of the vector, resulting in expression of a 

fusion protein of the first coding region and the sequence inserted 
in step (a); (d) exposing proteins from the host cell to glutathione 

resin, whereby the fusion protein will adhere to the resin; and (e) 
treating the adhered fusion protein with a protease to release the 

expression product of the nucleic acid sequence from the resin. A 
baculovirus/
Spodoptera
frugiperda
 expression system is 
preferred.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for expression of
proteins and to expression vectors and host cells used therefor.The lck gene product, p56lck, is a member of the src family
of protein tyrosine kinases. Cooper, J.A. (1990) in Peptides and
Protein Phosphorylation (Kemps, B.E., ed) pp. 85-113, CRC Press,
Boca Raton, FL.. The lck protein is normally expressed in T
lymphocytes and natural killer cells, where it likely performs a
variety of functions relating to signal transduction through ligand
binding to selected surface proteins. Bolen, J.A., and Veillette, A.
(1989) Trends Biochem. Sci. 14, 404- 407; Rudd, C.E. (1990)
Immunol. Today11, 400-406. In T-cells, p56lck forms a non-covalent
complex with the CD4 and CD8a. Veillette, A., Bookman,
M.A., Horak, E.M., and Bolen, J.A. (1988). For this reason, p56lck is
believed to aid in mediation of signals emanating from the T-cell
antigen receptor through ligation of CD4 or CD8 to non-polymorphic
determinants on antigen-bearing major
histocompatibility molecules. Shaw, A.S., Chalupny, J., Whitney,
J.A., Hammond, C., Amrein, K.E., Kavathas, P., Sefton, B.M., and
Rose, J.K., (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol.10, 1853-1862; Doyle, C., and
Strominger, J.L. (1987) Nature330, 256-259; Norment, A.M.,
Salter, R.D., Parham, P., Engelhard, V.H., and Littman, D.R. (1988)
Nature336, 79-81. More recently, p56lck has been implicated as
a signaling component of the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor. 
Hatakeyama, M., Kono, T., Kobayashi, N., Kawahara, A., Levin,
S.D., Perlmutter, R.M., and Tanaguchi, T. (1991) Science252,
1523-1528.A better understanding of the structure and regulation of
p56lck and similar proteins would clearly contribute to our
knowledge of early signal transduction events and a source of
large quantities of purified p56lck would be useful. While early
analysis of p56lck functions have been greatly facilitated by
antibodies directed against this protein, immunoaffinity purification
has been hampered by lack of an abundant source of enzyme.
This difficulty has been addressed in part by baculovirus
expression systems. Summers, M.D., and Smith, G.E. (1987). A
Manual for baculovirus vectors and insect cell culture procedures,
Texas A&M bulletin No. 1555, (College Station, Texas Agricultural
Experimental Station and Texas A&M University), 10-39. Recent
studies using a baculovirus expression system have reported
significant purification of p56lck using conventional
chromotography methodologies. Ramer S.E., Winkler, D.G.,
