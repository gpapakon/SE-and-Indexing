<ABSTRACT>
The control and gas-dispensing unit comprises a lower block (1), mounted on a gas bottle (4) and including a manometer (9) and a filling adapter (11), and on which is mounted permanently a sub-unit (32, 17) which can move axially in response to a rotation of a tubular control and actuation element (46) surrounding the sub-unit, which contains a reducer (27) and an indexable flow regulator (34, 35) and has a low-pressure outlet (45) and a mean-pressure outlet (51). Application in particular to the dispensing of medical oxygen.

Gas control and distribution assembly, designed to be
connected to a reservoir (4) containing the said gas at a

high pressure, including a low pressure outlet (45) and, in
series between the reservoir (4) and the low pressure

outlet (45), an isolating valve (6) exposed to the high
pressure, means for reducing the pressure (27, 29) which

can be coupled to the isolating valve (6), and means for
regulating the flow (34, 35), the low pressure outlet (45),

the means for regulating the flow (34, 35) and the means
for reducing the pressure (27, 29) being assembled in a

first movable sub-assembly (32, 17) disposed in a control
and operating structure (46) attached to a second sub-assembly

(1) incorporating the isolation valve (6) and
being designed to be mounted on the reservoir.
Assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that the
first sub-assembly (32, 17) includes a second medium

pressure gas outlet (51) upstream from the means for
regulating the flow (34, 35).
Assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized
in that the means for reducing the pressure (27, 29) are

disposed in a first block (17) cooperating in a sliding
manner with a first end (14) of the second sub-assembly (1)

and including a portion of hollow rod (19) cooperating
selectively with the isolating valve (6).
Assembly according to claim 3, characterized in that
the means for regulating the pressure includes a valve-carrier

(29) piston device (27) sliding in the first block
(17) and cooperating with a valve seating (22) formed in

the first block (17).
Assembly according to claim 3 or claim 4, characterized
in that the means for regulating the flow (34, 35) and the 

low pressure outlet (45) are disposed in a second block
(32) mounted on the first block (17).
Assembly according to one of claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that the control and operating structure

includes a tubular component (46) enclosing the first sub-assembly
(32, 17) and having, in its side wall, a first

(49) and a second (50
1
) cut-out through which the low
pressure outlet (45) and the medium pressure outlet (51)

respectively extend.
Assembly according to claim 6, characterized in that
the means for regulating the flow (34, 35) include an

operating device (37) disposed in an operating end (47) of
the tubular space (46).
Assembly according to claim 3 and either of claims 6 or
7, characterized in that the second cut-out (50
1
) forms a
cam profile cooperating with the medium pressure outlet

(51) for moving the first sub-assembly (32,17) axially in
response to a rotation of the tubular device (46).
Assembly according to claim 8, characterized in that it
includes a pressure release valve (52) mounted in the first

block (17) and passing through a third cut-out with a cam
profile (50
2
) formed in the side wall of the tubular device
(46) and cooperating with the pressure release valve device

(52) to assist in the axial movement of the first sub-assembly
(32,17) in response to a rotation of the tubular

device (46).
Assembly according to one of claims 5 to 9,
characterized in that the means for regulating the flow

include a disc (34) with calibrated holes (35) which can be
positioned in rotation with respect to the second block

(32). 
Assembly according to one of claims 6 to 10,
characterized in that the tubular device (46) has, at one

end, radial protuberances (48) received in a peripheral
groove (15) of the first end of the second sub-assembly

(1).
Assembly according to one of claims 2 to 11,
characterized in that the second sub-assembly includes a

third tubular block (1) having a second end (2) provided
with means for mounting on the reservoir (4).
Assembly according to claim 12, characterized in that
the second sub-assembly includes a filling device (11) with

a non-return valve (12) emerging in the third block (1)
upstream from the isolating valve (6) and enabling the

reservoir (4) to be filled.
Assembly according to claim 12 or claim 13,

characterized in that the second sub-assembly includes a
manometer (9) mounted in the third block (1)
Assembly according to claim 14, characterized in that
