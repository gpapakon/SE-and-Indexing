<DESCRIPTION>
The need for improved means of girth adjustment in footwear 
is accepted in the industry as continually more offerings are 
being limited by market economics to single widths for each size 
in length. Studies, including those of the U.S. Army QMC, have 
shown that such single width shoes afford only an approximate fit 
to less than a third of the populace. Furthermore, even this 
third receives less than a precise fit given the normal diurnal 
foot girth variation that occurs with changes of fluid concentration 
in the extremities, usually resulting in daily girth change 
ranges of up to two full width increments with even wider ranges 
experienced when there are concurrent changes in weather, 
altitude or a wearer's physical condition. The usual girth adjustment means including laces, buckles, 
touch fasteners and lately pressurized air and dial operated 
cables, not only present design limitations, but generally cannot 
be used in the fit-critical ball area where they would tend to 
inhibit the comfortable flexing of the foot in this region during 
the stride cycle. Furthermore, these usual girth adjustment 
means are not suitable for use with many shoe styles. While this inventor's recent inventions disclose practical 
means of shoe girth adjustment, none of these, including U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,967,492, 5,036,604 and 5,060,402, provide such 
means applicable to the manufacture of unlined footwear adaptable 
to a wide range of conventional shoe bottom styles, including 
those having the usual die-cut leather or composition soles.  
 Another inventor's invention, disclosed in the US patent 
No 4,858,341, provides an adjustment of the girth of the cavity 
of a shoe by changing the circumference of the cavity at about 
the ball portion. 
However, the adjustment is accomplished 
by means of an insole with a deformable side margin and is 
limited to constructions which utilize a change in 
circumference of the shoe cavity. Past attempts to deal with shoe girth adjustment by variation 
of insole elements have been limited to variation in the 
thickness of such elements. Such approaches not only do not afford 
the infinite adjustability in the adjustment range preferred  
 
for optimum fit, but more importantly, present serious orthopedic 
risks. The latter occur when insole elements of appreciably 
different thicknesses are needed to provide proper fit to a 
wearer whose feet are of substantially different width, as not 
infrequently occurs. Such adjustment, given that the wearer's 
legs are of

<CLAIMS>
A shoe (20), comprising a bottom member (36), an 
upper member (22) having two opposing side portions (28) 

and a top portion (24) said upper being made from a non-stretchable 
material, said bottom and upper members 

defining an enclosure, and an insole assembly (38) disposed 
within the enclosure adjacent and along at least a portion 

of the bottom member defining a cavity for insertion of a 
foot, said shoe having a heel portion, a midportion 

including a ball portion and a toe portion, said cavity 
having a width (x) extending between the two side portions 

at about the ball portion of the shoe and also having a 
fitting height (y) extending vertically from the insole 

assembly (38) to the lop portion (24) of the upper member 
(22) within the cavity at about the ball portion, said 

cavity having a constant circumference which is the 
distance around the periphery of the cavity formed by the 

upper member and the insole assembly at about the ball 
portion thereof, the height, width and circumference being 

measured at the same cross section of the cavity at about 
the ball portion thereof; characterized in that, the upper 

(22) is deformable in response to the insertion of a foot 
into the cavity in a manner which permits the ratio between 

the width (x) of the cavity and height (y) of the cavity to 
change at about the ball portion, while at the same time 

maintaining the circumference of the cavity constant so as 
to improve the fit of the shoe (20). 
The shoe of Claim 1, wherein the insole assembly 
comprises a plurality of insertable members, each one of 

which is of a different width than the others at the same 
location on each of the members. 
The shoe of Claim 1, wherein the insole assembly 
is a single adjustable member, the width of which can be 

infinitely varied over a defined range.  
 
The shoe of Claim 3, wherein the insole assembly 
is a planar member. 
The shoe of Claim 3, wherein adjustment can be effected 
from outside of the shoe when a foot is in the shoe. 
The shoe of Claim 3, wherein adjustment can be effected 
from the inside of the shoe. 
The shoe of Claim 1, wherein the insole assembly 
is an adjustable member which has contoured peripheral 

edges. 
The shoe of Claim 1, wherein the insole assembly 
comprises a fluid-containing bladder. 
The shoe of Claim 8, wherein the bladder contains 
at least two portions, sa
id portions being connected to 
each other by a connecting means disposed therebetween 

permitting fluid flow therebetween, wherein a first portion 
of the bladder is rearward of the midportion of the shoe, 

and wherein a second portion of the bladder is forward of 
the first portion of the bladder and contains a foam in 

which the fluid is dispersed. 
The shoe of Claim 9, wherein the second portion 
of the bladder has a side extension on each side thereof. 
The shoe of Claim 9, wherein the connecting means 
is collapsible under the weight of a foot during a stride.
