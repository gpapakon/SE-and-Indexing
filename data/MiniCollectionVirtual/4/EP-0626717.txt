<ABSTRACT>
In the bulb of a color cathode ray tube, a flat 
glass panel having a substantially uniform thickness is 

used. The flat glass panel has a glass wall which 
extends in a substantially vertical direction from the 

flat glass panel. The glass wall adheres to a funnel, 
which includes a neck portion in which an electron gun is 

disposed, by means of a glass adhesive so as to form the 
bulb. A shadow mask on which a number of apertures are 

formed is fixed to a frame with an appropriate tensile 
stress and the frame is mounted on the glass wall. The 

shadow mask is disposed at a position close to the 
phosphor screen formed on the inner surface of the flat 

glass panel, facing thereto. On the outer surface of the 
flat glass panel, a resin film comprising at least one 

layer is attached by means of an adhesive. The resin 
film has appropriate mechanical, optical and electrical 

properties with which the flat glass panel should have. 
Thus, various properties of the flat glass panel can be 

controlled. As a result, it makes it possible to provide 
a high-performance color cathode ray tube using a thin 

flat glass panel which has a sufficiently large 
mechanical strength and desirable optical 

characteristics, capable of displaying images with high 
resolution and high color tone without distortion over 

the entire front surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color 
cathode ray tube used for home television sets, computer 
monitors, and the like. A color cathode ray tube (hereinafter referred 
to as a color CRT) has been broadly used for a variety of 
home and industrial apparatuses including television sets 
and computer monitors. An enhanced quality of images is 
always requested for such a color CRT. Especially, in 
recent years, there has been a strong need to realize a 
color CRT capable of producing images with high 
resolution and high color tone without distortion over 
the entire front surface of the color CRT. Conventionally, a color CRT includes a glass 
bulb (hereinafter referred to as a bulb). The bulb has a 
curved panel made of glass (hereinafter referred to as a 
curved panel) and a phosphor screen is formed on the 
inner surface of the curved panel for emitting three 
colors, i.e., red, green, and blue. The bulb also 
includes a funnel which is attached to the curved panel 
by means of a glass adhesive so as to form the bulb. The 
inside of the bulb is in a high vacuum condition. A curved shadow mask with a thickness of 0.1 to 
0.3 mm having a number of apertures formed therethrough 
is disposed at a position close to the inner surface of 
the curved panel, facing thereto. The shadow mask is 
secured to a metal frame disposed inside the bulb so as 
to follow the curved profile of the inner surface of the 
curved panel. The funnel includes a neck portion in the rear  
 
thereof where an electron gun is disposed for emitting 
electron beams. The electron beams emitted from the 
electron gun pass through the apertures of the shadow 
mask to reach the phosphor screen on the inner surface of 
the curved panel, allowing the phosphor screen to emit 
light. If the distance between the shadow mask and the 
phosphor screen changes, the color tone of images 
produced on the phosphor screen also changes, resulting 
in a deterioration of the quality of the images. 
Accordingly, in order to obtain stable operating 
properties of the color CRT, the distance between the 
shadow mask and the phosphor screen should be kept 
constant irrespective of any change in the environmental 
conditions. However, in the above conventional color CRT 
where both the shadow mask and the phosphor screen are 
curved, it is difficult to precisely control the distance 
between two curved surfaces. In general, only approximately 20% of the total 
emission of electron beams output from the electron gun 
are actually incident to the phosphor
