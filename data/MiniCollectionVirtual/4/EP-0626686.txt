<ABSTRACT>
A karaoke reproducing apparatus for recording 
singing sound together with karaoke play sound, has a 

facility for printing information on the recorded 
musical program. The karaoke reproducing apparatus has 

a memory (13,14) which contains previously stored 
recorded music information including, for example, at 

least the title, songwriter's name, and composer's name 
for each of musical programs recorded on the recording 

medium (5). In response to a recording start command, 
the recorded music information corresponding to a 

musical program selected by an operation is read from 
the memory, and output to a printer (17). Since 

recorded music information can be printed on a printed 
member such as a label and preserved as a record when 

singing sound is recorded together with karaoke play 
sound, the label, if adhered to a recording medium on 

which the sound is recorded, allows the user to readily 
know the recorded contents afterward. According to 

another aspect of the invention, a karaoke reproducing 
apparatus has a memory which contains copy right 

information on each of musical programs recorded on a 
recording medium. For a recording prohibited musical 

program, its karaoke play music can be prevented from 
being recorded so as to appropriately protect the copy 

right thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
reproducing accompanied music, having recording media on
which a plurality of musical programs are recorded, so as
to reproduce one selected from the plurality of musical
programs. The accompanied music especially prepared for
people to sing with will be called "karaoke music", as is
generally done, and a reproducing apparatus particularly
for reproducing the karaoke music will be called the
"karaoke reproducing apparatus" in this specification.Some karaoke reproducing apparatuses include a
recording apparatus or output terminals for connection
with an external recording apparatus so as to enable a
song sung by a person to be recorded with karaoke music.
The recording is performed on a recording medium such as
a compact disk which may be reproduced on a later date in
order for the person to listen to the song the person
sang accompanied with the karaoke music.It is desirable that the recording medium thus
recorded be provided with a label, attached thereon, on
which information on recorded music such as the titles of 
songs are written, so that the contents of the recording
medium can be readily known afterwards without actually
reproducing it.However, writing recorded music information on a
label requires time and labor to a user, and such written
information, if only including the titles, may be
insufficient for later use.Another point to be considered in recording karaoke
play sound is that such recording act is subjected to the
copy right law so that there are musical programs of
which recording is permitted and those of which recording
is prohibited, depending on copy right owners of the
respective musical programs.Conventionally, users have determined whether nor
not recording is permitted to a selected musical program
by use of a reference table. Stated in another way, the
right of copy right owners has been protected from
illegal recording, placing confidence in users that they
would not record music of which recording is prohibited.
Alternatively, there is a karaoke reproducing apparatus
which only collects musical programs of which recording
is permitted, in order to avoid the handling of matters
related to the copy right.It is however difficult to appropriately protect the
right of copy right owners while placing confidence in 
users. Moreover, the above-mentioned karaoke
reproducing apparatus, which only has recorded permitted
musical programs, cannot unfailingly provide musical
programs with which people desire to sing.JP-A-63239653
