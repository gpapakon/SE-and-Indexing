<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a crankcase for an internal combustion engine with cylinders arranged in a V-configuration, in which a main oil gallery (13) is provided between the two cylinder banks (4, 5). The object of the invention is to supply the uppermost points (14) of the crankshaft main bearings with oil from the main oil gallery (13) and at the same time to provide broad windows (12), extending transversely over the crankshaft main bearings, in the walls (8) subdividing the crankcase in the upper area, in order to alleviate the disadvantages produced by the gas pulsation in the crank chamber.   This object is achieved by the arrangement of a pipe (16) between the main oil gallery (13) and the uppermost point (14) of each crankshaft main bearing. The pipes (16) which carry the oil to the required points scarcely reduce the effective cross-section of the windows (12). As a result, despite a window (12) provided transversely above the crankshaft main bearings, the crankshaft main bearings can by simple means be supplied with oil at the optimum point (14) from the overhead main oil gallery (13).

<CLAIMS>
Housing for an internal combustion engine with cylinders arranged 
in a V shape, in which cylinder banks in each case having at least 

two cylinders with a crankcase surrounding a crank chamber together 
form one part, in the crankcase are provided thrust bearings for 

receiving the main bearings of a crankshaft, which form walls and 
divide the crank chamber into chambers, and oil is supplied to the 

main bearings through a main oilway extending between the two 
cylinder banks parallel to the crankshaft axis as well as supply ways 

branching off from the main oilway and extending in the walls 
defining the chambers of the crank chamber in the longitudinal 

direction of the engine, characterised in that the walls (8) defining 
the crank chamber (7) in the longitudinal direction of the engine are 

provided with an aperture (12) extending continuously across the 
width of the walls (8), and the aperture chamber between the main 

oilway (13) arranged above the aperture (12) and the crankshaft main 
bearing arranged below the aperture (12) is bridged by a pipe (15) 

forming the supply way. 
Housing according to claim 1, characterised in that the pipe (15) 
is formed in each case by a tube (16) which is held in a bore (17) of 

the thrust bearing (10) of the crankshaft main bearing as well as a 
bore (18) intersecting with the main oilway (13).
