<CLAIMS>
A slide ring seal for a rotating shaft (20), with 
a housing (21) with a stationary sealing ring (2) 

located therein, the end sealing surface of which 
contacts the sealing surface of a rotating slide ring 

(1), the slide ring (1) being fastened to a sleeve (6) 
connected to the rotating shaft (20), which sleeve has 

a plurality of regions (30, 31, 32), distributed across 
the periphery, which are incorporated positively in 

counter-regions (40) of the slide ring (1),
 
characterised in that
 
the regions (30, 31, 32) form part of a spherical 

triangle (35), the counter-regions (40) having recesses 
which are incorporated into the corresponding zones of 

the spherical triangle (35), and 
that the spherical triangle (35) is at an axial 

distance from a sealing flange (36) of the sleeve (6) 
in the region of the sealing surfaces (50) of the slide 

ring (1) and the resiliently loaded sealing ring (2). 
A slide ring seal according to Claim 1, wherein 
the sleeve is connected on the side remote from the 

sealing flange (36) to a holding ring (10),
 
characterised in that the sleeve (6) extends through 

the entire housing (21). 
A slide ring seal according to Claims 1 and 2, 
wherein the holding ring (10) is axially secured by a 

spring ring (11) incorporated in the sleeve (6),
 
characterised in that the holding ring (10) is 

additionally held by a plurality of holding parts (13) 
fastened to the housing (21).
