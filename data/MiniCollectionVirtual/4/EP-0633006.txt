<ABSTRACT>
Face bow for receiving and transferring a jaw model with the correct spatial orientation relative to the skull into a jaw joint articulator, comprising a transfer bracket (60) surrounding the face and a guide column (80) releasably fastened thereon and intended to carry an adjustable mouthpiece (86). The bracket (60) has an elongated centering depression on its upper and lower sides (1, 2), and the guide column (80) has an adjustment projection (85) which is adapted to be inserted in positively locking manner in the centering depression (82).

A face bow for receiving and transferring a jaw 
model in spatially correct skull orientation in a jaw 

joint articulator, with a transfer bracket (60) enclosing 
the face and a guide column (80) releasably secured to 

the transfer bracket (60) for supporting an adjustable 
mouthpiece (86), characterised in that the bracket (60) 

comprises an elongated centring recess on its upper or 
lower side (1, 2), and the guide column (80) comprises an 

adjustment projection (85), which is constructed for 
positive-locking engagement in the centring recess (82). 
A face bow according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the adjustment projection (85) is constructed as a 

perpendicularly projecting pin. 
A face bow according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the centring recess (82) is constructed as a 

groove having a V-shaped cross section. 
A face bow according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the centring recess (82) extends 

approximately perpendicular to the jaw frontal plane 
and/or the jaw joint hinge axis (23). 
A face bow according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the centring recess (82) extends 

approximately in the direction of the jaw median plane 
(44) and/or lies in the centre transverse plane of the 

transfer bracket. 
A face bow according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a bore (83) constructed for the 

introduction and fixing of the guide column (80), the  
 

centring recess (82) being arranged so as to extend 
radially or perpendicularly in the region of the opening 

edge of the bore (83). 
A face bow according to one of the preceding claims, 
the end regions (61a, 61b) of the transfer bracket (60) 

comprising callipers (62a, 62b) for the jaw hinge axis 
(23) for fitting the bracket (20) at this point, 

characterised in that the callipers (62a, 62b) are guided 
so as to be displaceable and fixable in the direction of 

the hinge axis (23). 
A face bow according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the callipers are constructed as supports of code 

markings which are symmetrical to one another in relation 
to a centre plane extending transversely to the hinge 

axis (23) or in relation to the jaw median plane (44) and 
can be moved past a fixed adjustment marking on the 

bracket (60). 
A face bow according to claim 7 or 8, characterised 
in that the callipers (62a, 62b) are constructed as bolts 

or pins, which penetrate the bracket ends (61a, 61b) in 
the direction of the hinge axis (23) and are enclosed by 

colour-coded rings (68a, 68b). 
A face bow according to one of the preceding claims, 
the end regions (61a, 61b) of the transfer bracket (60) 

comprising callipers (62a, 62b) for the jaw hinge axis 
(23) for fitting the bracket
 (20) at this point, 
characterised by a support projection (70) arranged in a 

central section (71) of the bracket (60) for resting 
against the glabella. 
A face bow according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the projection (70) is guided so as to be fixable in  

 
the direction of the glabella and/or at an angle to or 

perpendicular to the plane defined by the bracket (60). 
An adapter for a jaw articulator for connecting the 
jaw articulator to the mouthpiece guide column (80) of a 

face bow according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a centring recess (92) for receiving the 

adjustment projection (85) of the guide column (80) in a 
positive-locking manner. 
An adapter according to claim 12, characterised by 
releasable securing to the upper or lower part (1, 2) of 

the articulator. 
An adapter according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a bore (89) constructed for the 

introduction and fixing of the guide column (80), the 
centring recess (92) being arranged so as to extend 

radially or perpendicular in the region of the opening 
edge of the bore (89).
