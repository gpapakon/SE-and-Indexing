<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector is comprised of an outer 
housing (4) having a rack and pinion lever (6), where the 

outer housing (4) can receive in sliding engagement an 
inner housing (40). The inner housing carries a plurality 

of receptacle contacts (54) and a plurality of shunt 
contacts (100) disposed above selected contacts (54). The 

shunt spring (100) has a base wall (102) including 
individual shunt contact springs (104) having a projection 

(108) which extends through a window (96) of a central 
wall (98) to make shunt contact with adjacent electrical 

terminals (54) positioned therebeneath.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an electrically shunted
connector as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.This invention relates to an electrical connector
having a short circuiting facility and to a short
circuiting spring therefore, the invention particularly,
but not exclusively, concerning such a connector for use
and protecting from accidental firing, an electrical
detonator for inflating an automotive air bag.In automotive air bag deployment systems, crash
sensors disposed in the forward part of a motor vehicle
are connected to the detonators of air bags before the
front seats of the vehicle. Such a detonator may be
connected to ignition voltage means by means of an
electrical connector, the parts of which can be unmated to
allow the air bag and/or the detonator thereof to be
removed for replacement testing, and the like. In the
unmated, or indeed in a partially unmated condition of the
electrical connector, there is the risk of the detonator,
which is necessarily very sensitive, being accidently
actuated so that the air bag is accidently inflated. This
may occur, for example as a result of leakage or other
stray voltage, or accidently applied current, energizing
the ignition current supply leads of the detonator for
example, by electro magnetic induction.For the avoidance of the risk described above, there
is disclosed in GB-A- 2 245 775, an electrical connector
assembly comprising a receptacle part and a pin carrying
part for mating with, the receptacle part comprising an
insulating housing defining first and second space
parallel through cavities each receiving a pin receptacle
terminal therein and intermediate said cavities a short
circuiting spring having a normal first position which a
contact surfaces thereof engage against the terminals to
provide a shorted electrical path therebetween. A
displaced second position in which the contact surfaces 
are cut of engagement with the pin terminals is also
provided, where the pin carrying part comprises an
insulating member with projecting pins for mating with the
receptacle terminals as the parts are being mated and a
camming member for engaging the short circuiting spring
to displace it from the second position when partially
mated, the short circuiting spring resiling from its
second position to its first position upon withdrawal of
the camming member from the short circuiting spring.In this known electrical connector assembly, the
short circuiting spring which has been stamped and formed
from a single piece of sheet metal stock, has a pair of
wings
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electrically shunted connector comprising a
connector housing (4) having at least two rows of terminal

receiving passageways (52), where at least some of said
passageways carry signal carrying contacts (54), said housing

further comprising shunting terminal passageways (80) opposed
to some of said terminal receiving passageways carrying

shunting terminals (100) for commoning two signal carrying
contacts in the opposing row,

the shunting terminal passageways (80) in
the housing being profiled for front loading of said shunting

terminals (100) therein, characterized in that said housing (4) and shunt
terminals (100) have relief areas to prevent overstressing said

shunt terminals upon insertion, therein, and
in that lead-in sections (114) of the shunting terminals extend forwardly towards

said front face (42) of said housing (4) and obliquely
across the associated shunting terminal passageway (80) and said relief area in said shunting terminals is

formed by openings (116) opposing said lead-in sections
(114), allowing said lead-in sections to pass

therethrough.
The connector of claim 1, characterized in
that said housing relief area is comprised of a

transverse opening (45) spanning said shunting terminal
receiving passageway (80).
The connector of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
said shunting terminals (100) are comprised of a base 

portion (102) having a reversely bent leg portion (104),
where a contact section (110) is formed on said reversely

bent leg (104) at a projection (108).
The connector of any of claims 1-3, characterized in
that said shunting terminals (100) comprise base wall (102),

folded-up side walls and two shunt contacts extending
forwardly from a front edge of said base wall.
The connector of any of claims 1-4, characterized in
that tab portions (125) extend from edges of said side

walls (122) and are folded over the shunt contact arms
(104) to hold them in a prestressed condition.
The connector of any of claims 1-5, characterized in
that a transverse opening (130) is formed through the

base wall (102) forming a locking edge (132).
The connector of any of claims 1-6, characterized in
that the shunting terminal receiving cavities (80) include a

window (96) communicating to corresponding signal
carrying terminal cavities (70).
The connector of claim 6, characterized in that said
housing (40) has a transverse opening (68) axially

aligned with opening (130) and is slidably receivable
into an outer housing shell (2) having a locking arm

(128) receivable in said opening (68) of said housing 
(40) and into said opening (130) of said shunting terminals

(100).
