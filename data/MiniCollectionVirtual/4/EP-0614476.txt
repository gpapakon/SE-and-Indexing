<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns low styrene 
emission vinyl ester resin and unsaturated polyester resin formulations 
containing ceresin wax as a styrene emission depressant 
and drying oil and epoxidized drying oil as secondary 
adhesion promoters. Most vinyl ester resins and unsaturated 
polyester resins contain polymerizable, vaporizable, 
ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene as a 
reactive diluent. Since styrene or other polymerizable, 
vaporizable, ethylenically unsaturated monomer is a 
volatile component which tends to be released to the 
atmosphere during storage and/or curing of the 
thermosettable vinyl ester and unsaturated polyester 
resins, it is becoming more and more desirable to reduce 
the level of styrene or other polymerizable, vaporizable 
monomer which is released to the atmosphere during 
storage and/or cure. One method for reducing the 
release of styrene or other polymerizable, vaporizable 
monomer into the atmosphere is to include ceresin wax in 
the formulation. While this does indeed reduce the 
amount of styrene released into the atmosphere, the  
 
composition suffers from a loss in secondary adhesion. 
It would therefore be highly desirable and beneficial to 
incorporate into the formulation components which will 
eliminate or decrease the loss in secondary adhesion. It has now been discovered that the loss in 
secondary adhesion from polymerizable, vaporizable, 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer such as styrene 
containing vinyl ester resin and unsaturated polyester resin 
formulations containing ceresin wax as a polymerizable, 
vaporizable, ethylenically unsaturated monomer emission 
suppressant can be avoided by incorporating into 
the formulation a combination of corn oil and epoxidized 
soybean oil. The present invention concerns an improvement 
in vinyl ester and unsaturated polyester resin 
compositions containing a polymerizable, vaporizable, 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and 
ceresin wax; which improvement comprises 
employing in said compositions 
at least one drying oil, at least 
one epoxidized drying oil and ceresin wax in the proportions 
specified in Claim 1. Another aspect of the present invention 
pertains to a polymerizable, vaporizable, ethylenically 
unsaturated vinyl monomer emission suppressant/secondary adhesion 
promoter additive composition comprising (1) at least 
one vaporizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, (2) 
ceresin wax, (3) at least one drying oil, and (4) at 
least one epoxidized drying oil. Another aspect of the
