<ABSTRACT>
An electronic liquid flow-measuring system comprising 
of a power source; a main electronic flow meter and a 

secondary liquid low flow electronic meter connected as a 
by-pass to said main meter; a microprocessor or for 

controlling flow measurements and the three position valve; 
a three position valve connected to both meters for closing 

said electronic main flowmeter at very low flows permitting 
only said secondary liquid flow meter to operate at low 

flows, such that at normal flows the valve is in its second 
position allowing the liquid to flow through both meters, 

and when the liquid flow is beyond a predetermined flow the 
valve is in its third position blocking all flow, and 

wherein said third position is achieved by means for 
opening a gate that permits the moving part of the valve to 

reach its third position and digital and analog processing 
means for producing readable numeric output values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic flowmeter
comprising of a high (large) flow detector and a low (small)
flow detector. Each detector has a magnetic or other pick-up
sensor and microprocessor to automatically detect and stop
undesirable excessive flows beyond a predetermined consumption
graph. The flowmeter is designed to detect very low
continuous flows (fluid leak). This flowmeter saves valuable
fluids and energy required to pump the fluids. This flowmeter
is self diagnostic.Fluid flow meters are well known as, for example in U.S.
Pat. No. 3,677,084. This patent relates to two fluid meters,
a high flow meter and a low flow meter which provides improved
accuracy characteristics compared to older types of meters.
The meter is designed for easy manufacturing, is less
expensive, lightweight and allows for easy service. This flow
meter does not help to automatically detect and stop
undesirable excessive flows beyond a predetermined consumption
graph nor to detect, memorize, register and alert when a
continuous slow flow exists (flow leak). This meter is fully
mechanical and does not have a microprocessor. U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,799 illustrates a flow meter which
provides a fluid meter which has more precise measuring
capability due to the implementation of a small meter and a
large one utilizing a by-pass between the two meters. The
disadvantage of this flow meter is that it does not help to
automatically detect and stop undesirable excessive flow
beyond a predetermined consumption graph nor to detect,
memorize, register and alert when a continuous slow flow exist
(fluid leak). This meter is fully mechanical and does not
have a microprocessor.U.S. Pat. No. 4,175,434 describes an extension of the
previous patent and relates to the same fluid meter but which
has more precise measuring capability. This flowmeter
consists of a pair of meters wherein the measurements obtained
are constantly integrated. This arrangement enables the
readings obtained from the assembly to be readily interpreted.
This flowmeter facilitates easy maintenance and calibration.
The disadvantage of this flow meter is that it does not help
to automatically detect and stop undesirable excessive flow
beyond a predetermined consumption nor to detect, memorize,
register and alert when a continuous slow flow exist (flow
leak). This meter is fully mechanical and does not have a
microprocessor.U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,943 describes an electronic
flowmeter. Flow measurements are made by digitally measuring
the time periods between successive

<CLAIMS>
A liquid flow measuring system comprising a power
source (54), a main flow meter (34) and a secondary

low flow meter (16) located in a by-pass pipe to said
main flow meter; a three position valve (26) connected

to both said main and secondary meters, said three
position valve having a flow path adjuster moveable

between a first position, a second position, and a
third position to establish a selected flow path

through the valve, and a latch mechanism (22, 24)
permitting or preventing movement of the flow path

adjuster into the third position, wherein the first
position of said flow path adjuster substantially

prevents liquid flow to said main flow meter at a
predetermined low flow rate and permits operation of

only said secondary flow meter (16), wherein the
second position of said flow path adjuster enables, at

a predetermined normal flow rate, liquid to flow
through both meters, and wherein the third position of

said flow path adjuster enables blockage of substantially
all fluid flow through both flow meters at a

predetermined high flow rate; and a microprocessor
(44) responsive to signals representative of flow

meter data, for controlling flow measurements by
operating the three position valve (26) and said latch

mechanism (22, 24).
A system according to claim 1, wherein the three
position valve (26) is a ball valve.
A system according to claim 2, wherein the ball is
held in the closed position by a magnet (28).
A system according to claim 1, wherein the latch
mechanism (22, 24) is solenoid (21) operated to allow

the valve to reach its third position. 
A system according to claim 4, wherein the solenoid
(21) is operated by an external or remote control

mechanism.
A system according to claim 1, wherein the power
source (54) is selected from external power, light

operated solar cells, or dynamo, alternator or generator
driven by the fluid flow in either the high or

low fluid flow paths.
A system according to claim 1, wherein each flow meter
has a separate electronic counter and the flows detected

by the flow meters are summed by the microprocessor,
and wherein said microprocessor registers

and alerts when a continuous low flow exists.
A system according to claim 7, wherein the latch
mechanism (22, 24) is solenoid operated, allowing the

flow path adjuster to reach its third position, and
wherein the microprocessor (44) automatically detects

predetermined high flow rates and activates the
solenoid-operated latch mechanism to allow the flow

rate adjuster to reach its third position and block
fluid flow.
A system according to claim 8, wherein the microprocessor
compares the fluid flows in both the main

flow meter (24) and the secondary flow meter (16) and
alerts of a malfunction in the accuracy of the meter

readings when there is a predetermined discrepancy
between the flows measured by the main and secondary

meters.
A system according to claim 1, wherein said system is
connected to at least one of a sonic, ultrasonic, and

longitudinal mechanical wave transmitter/receiver
system (47, 50). 
A system according to claim 1, wherein a magnet fixes
the flow path adjuster in the first position.
A system according to claim 1, wherein the flow path
adjuster of the valve can be cylindrical, elliptical,

bullet-shaped or T-shaped.
