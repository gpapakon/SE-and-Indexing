<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for monitoring the 
pressure of pneumatic tyres on motor vehicles while 

driving, and consists in having combined a pressure 
sensor (4) mounted on the tyre, equipped with suitable 

means (7) for neutralizing the effects of centrifugal 
force, with a permanent magnet (5) designed to follow the 

movements of the sensor, so that while the wheel revolves, 
the magnet induces, at each revolution of the 

tyre, in a induction coil (10) located on a fixed part of 
the suspension, an impulse of which the time integral 

correlates directly to the pressure of the tyre, as a 
result of which, by processing the impulses received by 

the induction coil by means of a microprocessor device, 
it is possible to energize a signal in the driver's 

cab, should the pressure of the tyre stray outside a 
pre-determined range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for monitoring 
the pressure of pneumatic tyres on motor vehicles 
while driving. The development of private motoring and commercial 
transport by road has gradually brought about extremely 
congested and dangerous traffic conditions, which have 
caused a widespread increase in road accidents. A significant proportion of these accidents may be due 
to the inadequate state of efficiency of several parts 
of the motor vehicle. Sensitization to these issues on the part of the authorities 
responsible for the management of traffic, and 
users and manufacturers of motor vehicles, has created 
the conditions of synergy necessary to promote the 
research and development of all means aimed at increasing 
the reliability of motor vehicles. At the same time, levels of awareness of the state of 
efficiency of cars and/or trucks have been considerably 
advanced as a result of the increasing use of electronic 
monitoring of vehicles' vital components. An important vehicle component, particularly for commercial 
vehicles, on the development of which the 
automotive industry is now focusing its attention, is a  
 
device capable of providing the driver, while driving, 
with information regarding the state of the tyres. Until now, such a device has not been produced because 
of the objective difficulties encountered, and the 
economic incompatibility of the solutions found to 
date. A known device exists, which is based on radio transmission, 
but which has not yet graduated beyond the 
laboratory testing stage both because of its cost, and 
because there are founded doubts with regard to its 
reliability due to the choice of radio frequencies and 
possible interference. The present invention is proposed as a means of meeting 
this need without necessitating significant modifications 
to the current geometry of the components in 
question, and without imposing levels of technological 
sophistication that might give rise to doubts about the 
system. The invention consists in having combined a pressure 
sensor mounted on the tyre and hence rotating with the 
tyre, equipped with suitable means for neutralizing the 
effects of centrifugal force, with a permanent magnet 
designed to follow the movements of the sensor, so that 
while the wheel revolves, the magnet induces, at each 
revolution of the tyre, in a conduction coil located on  
 
a fixed part of the suspension, an impulse of which the 
time integral correlates directly to the pressure of 
the tyre, as a result of which the

Device for monitoring the pressure of pneumatic 
tyres on motor vehicles while driving, characterized in 

that it has combined a tyre pressure sensor (4), mounted 
on the tyre (11), and hence rotating with the tyre, 

and equipped with suitable means (7) for neutralizing 
the effects on the sensor (4) of centrifugal force, 

with a permanent magnet (5) designed to follow the 
movements of the sensor, so that while the wheel revolves, 

the magnet (5) induces, at each revolution of the 
tyre, in a induction coil (10) located on a fixed part 

of the suspension, an impulse of which the time integral 
correlates directly to the pressure of the tyre 

11, as a result of which the induction coil (10) transmits 
the impulses carrying the information, to a 

central unit located in the driver's cab and equipped 
with a microprocessor. Therefore, once the device is 

calibrated within a range of variation in tyre pressure, 
any further variation in pressure outside the 

aforementioned range causes the sensor (4) to move, 
thus causing the magnet (5) to move in relation to the 

induction coil (10), resulting in a variation of the 
impulse to the induction coil (10) and energizing of a 

signal in the driver's cab. 
Device for monitoring the pressure of pneumatic 
 

tyres as in claim 1, characterized in that the sensor 
device consists of bellows (4) to one end of which is 

connected a permanent magnet (5) designed to follow the 
axial movements of the bellows (4) that occur as the 

pressure of the air contained in the tyre (11) varies, 
and contained in a casing (2) connected by means of a 

coupling (3) to a housing fashioned in the wheel rim - 
or even constructed with the wheel rim itself - in such 

a way that the inside of the coupling (3) puts the air 
contained in the tyre (11) in communication with the 

inside (9) of the bellows (4). 
Device for monitoring the pressure of pneumatic 

tyres as in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that, for 
the purpose of neutralizing the effects of centrifugal 

force on the sensor (4), in the cavity (6), between the 
outer wall of the bellows (4) and the inner wall of the 

casing (2), a liquid (7) is introduced, which fulfills 
the function of hydrostatic suspension, and is of 

suitable density and level to support the elastic 
bellows (4) in a horizontal position during rotation of 

the device. 
Device for monitoring the pressure of pneumatic 
tyres as in claims 1, 2 and 3, characterized in that, 

into the cavity (6), during calibration of the device, 
a gas is introduced at a pressure equal to the pressure 

 
to which the tyre (11) is inflated, in such a way as to 

balance the pressure inside and outside the bellows. 
Device for monitoring the pressure of pneumatic 
tyres as in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that a 

safety valve (8) is disposed between the coupling (3) 
and the inside of the bellows (4); the valve has the 

function of shutting off communication between the 
inside of the tyre and the inside of the bellows in 

order to prevent the tyre from deflating, in the event 
of breakage of the device. 
Device for monitoring the pressure of pneumatic 
tyres as in claims 1 and 2 characterized in that the 

induction coil (10) is mounted on a fixed part of the 
vehicle's suspension along the same axis as the longitudinal 

axis of the device and hence of the bellows (4) 
and magnet (5). 
Device for monitoring the pressure of pneumatic 
tyres as in claims 1, 2 and 6 characterized in that the 

induction coil (10) is connected to a microprocessor 
which analyses the data and transmits them to an illuminated 

display which indicates the state of equilibrium, 
or absence thereof, of the tyre, and/or activates 

an acoustic signal should the tyre pressure stray 
outside the pressure range with which the sensor device 

(4) has been calibrated.
