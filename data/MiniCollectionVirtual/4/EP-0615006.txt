Distributor for viscous liquids consisting of a feed pipe and a 
number of valves linked to the feed pipe, wherein each valve 

includes a section with diameter b, designed as a housing with a 
guide cylinder, a discharge opening with diameter a opening into a 

discharge pipe and a valve rod which can move in the guide cylinder 
between the valve open and valve closed positions, characterised in 

that 

the guide cylinder is eccentrically widened on the side 
opposite to the discharge opening to form an elliptical cross-section 

with a maximum diameter (b + d) of about (1.1 or 
1.2)·b, an axial length c in the widened region of about 

(0.8 to 1.0)·a and the cross section of the wall undergoes a 
gradual transition between circular and elliptical, 
the valve rod has a valve block with a mushroom-shaped top 
section consisting of pedestal and cap, wherein the total height 

f from the base of the valve block to the cap at the point of its 
maximum diameter t is approximately equal to (1.0 to 1.05)·a 

and the diameter t is approximately equal to (0.75 to 0.95)·b, 
and the valve block top section projects into the feed pipe when 
the valve is closed and produces a larger liquid flow on the 

widened side of the guide cylinder than on the side adjacent to 
the discharge opening when the valve is open. 
Distributor for viscous liquids according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the valve rod can be adjusted to regulate the overall flow 

of viscous liquid and the ratio of the flow on the widened side to 
that on the side adjacent to the discharge opening.  

 
Distributor for viscous liquids according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that the valve rod is adjusted so that the ratio of the flow on 

the widened side to that on the side adjacent to the discharge 
opening is in the range 1.1. to 2.5. 
Distributor for viscous liquids according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the valve rod is adjusted so that the ratio of the flows is 

about 2.0. 
Distributor for viscous liquids according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the valves linked to the feed pipe are arranged 

radially around this feed pipe. 
Distributor for viscous liquids according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the valves linked to the feed pipe are 

arranged alongside each other, perpendicular to this feed pipe. 
Distributor for viscous liquids according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the distributor is surrounded by at least one 

heating jacket or by strip heaters. 
Distributor for viscous liquids according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that 


in longitudinal section, the widened region of the guide 
cylinder has the shape of an irregular trapezium, wherein the 

walls in the transition region between cylindrical and widened 
region on the side of the feed pipe form an angle of about 20° 

and on the other side form an angle of about 60°, with reference 
to the axis of the guide cylinder, the depth d being about 

0.165 ·b and the axial length c being about 0.92 ·a, 
and the mushroom-shaped valve block top section has the  
 

following dimensions, 
diameter e of the pedestal is about 0.30 ·b, 

diameter t of the cap is about 0.85 ·b, 
height g of the pedestal is about 0.54 ·a and 

height h of the crown is about 0.60 ·a, 
wherein the upper apex of the cap forms an angle of about 45° 

with the axis of the guide cylinder.
