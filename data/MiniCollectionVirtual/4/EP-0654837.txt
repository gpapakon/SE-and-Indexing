<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improved electrodes and method of
manufacture of electrodes, and in particular a gas diffusion electrode with an
improved performance and a method of manufacture of such electrodes for use in
fuel cells.It is useful to recall that in a fuel cell, a fuel, which may be
hydrogen, a hydrocarbon or an oxygen-containing fuel such as methanol, is
oxidised at a fuel electrode (anode) and oxygen is reduced at the cathode. An
electrolyte contacts the electrodes and may be alkaline or acidic, liquid or solid.
The liquid electrolyte phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) operating at a temperature
of 190°C-210°C, is the type of fuel cell closest to commercialisation and will find 
applications in the multi-megawatt utility power generation market and also as
combined heat and power, ie co-generation systems, in the 50 to several hundred
kilowatt range. Fuel cells in which the electrolyte is a solid polymer are known
as solid polymer fuel cells, (SPFCs), or proton exchange membrane fuel cells,
(PEMFCs). The solid proton-conducting polymer membrane electrolytes,
commonly based on perfluorosulphonic acid materials, have to be maintained in a
hydrated form during operation in order to prevent loss of ionic conduction through
the electrolyte. This limits the operating temperature of the SPFC typically to
between 80°C and 120°C dependent on the operating pressure. The SPFC does,
however, provide much higher power density output than the PAFC, and can
operate efficiently at much lower temperatures. Because of this it is envisaged that
the SPFC will find use in applications such as small scale residential power
generation and in vehicular power generation. In particular, zero emissions
regulations have been passed in areas of the United States which are likely to
restrict the use of combustion engines in the future. Prototype SPFC-powered
vehicles are now being demonstrated for these applications.In these fuel cells, both the anode reaction, at which the fuel is
oxidised, and the cathode reaction, at which oxygen is reduced, require
electrocatalysts in order to proceed at useful rates. Precious metals, and in
particular platinum, have been found to be the most efficient and stable
electrocatalysts for all low temperature fuel cells, operating at below 300°C, in
which the electrolyte may be acidic or alkaline in nature, but are particularly useful
in acid electrolyte fuel cells such as the SPFC. The platinum electrocatalyst is provided as very small particles
(20-50Å), of high surface area, which are
