<ABSTRACT>
A device for mechanically expanding a pipe or pipe 
section. The device comprises a housing (1) and an expansion 

head (2) which comprises an expansion mandrel (3) with a polygonal 
cross-section which increases from an end face thereof and 

is bounded by external faces, and expansion jaws (4) which 
interact with the expansion mandrel (3) and are guided in the 

housing (1). The device also comprises a hydraulic cylinder (10) 
whose cylinder wall rests against the housing (1), and the 

piston is connected by way of a rod to the expansion 
mandrel (3). The expansion mandrel (3) can thereby be moved in its 

lengthwise direction relative to the expansion jaws (4), in 
order to move the expansion jaws (4) essentially in the radial 

direction. According to a first aspect of the invention, at 
least the expansion mandrel (3) , the rod and the cylinder are 

made of metal in which the ratio [MPa/(kg/m³)] between the 

0.2% yield limit [MPa] and the density [kg/m³]
 is considerably 
greater than that of structural steel. The ratio 

between the 0.2% yield limit and the density is preferably 
greater than 0.100.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
mechanically expanding a pipe or pipe section, comprising a 
housing and an expansion head, which expansion head 
comprises an expansion mandrel with a cross-section which 
increases from an end face thereof and is bounded by an 
external face, and expansion jaws which interact with the 
expansion mandrel and rest against the housing, and also 
comprising a hydraulic cylinder whose cylinder wall rests 
against the housing and whose piston is connected by way of 
a rod to the expansion mandrel, which can thereby be moved 
in its lengthwise direction relative to the expansion jaws, 
in order to move the expansion jaws essentially in the 
radial direction. Such a device is generally known and is used in 
particular for working an end of a metal pipe or pipe 
section, for example a pipe bend, with a diameter lying 
between several tens of millimetres and hundreds of 
millimetres. Working the pipe means that, for example, the 
diameter of an end of the pipe is enlarged in such a way 
that an identical pipe can be connected thereto as in a 
spigot and socket joint. If the shape of the expansion jaws 
is suitably selected, the end of a pipe or pipe section can 
also be given a different shape at the end, for example an 
angular or in fact a conical shape. Such a device can also 
be used for making a slightly deformed pipe end round 
again. During the mechanical expansion of a metal pipe 
great force must be exerted on the expansion mandrel by the 
hydraulic cylinder, in order to ensure that the expansion 
jaws are pressed with very great force against the wall of 
the pipe. The pressure of the hydraulic oil, which is 
supplied to the cylinder by separate pressure means through 
a high-pressure hose, is several hundred bar in this case, 
and the force in the connecting rod between the cylinder 
and the expansion mandrel can be several tens of tonnes. As 
a result of these very great forces being exerted on the 
parts, it is essential for such devices to be made of  
 
extremely sturdy design. The devices of the abovementioned type known until 
now are based on engineering principles generally applied 
in this sector, which means that the devices are high in 
weight, due to the required sturdiness. This has the 
disadvantage that in practice they are suitable for use 
only in a more or less fixed location, for example in an 
engineering works. The object of the invention is to eliminate the 
abovementioned disadvantage and to propose measures which 
lead to a
