<ABSTRACT>
The device proposed has means for producing a magnetic field and an array made up of a multiplicity of Hall elements. The device produces a magnetic-induction effect which is dependent on the geometrical disposition of the Hall-element array relative to an object whose position is to be determined. The Hall elements are spaced a given distance apart along a given line. Also included is an interpolation circuit which interpolates the analogue output signals from at least two Hall elements.

Arrangement for detecting a geometric relation 
with a device with magnetic field source (Mg), an 

arrangement consisting of a multiplicity of Hall elements 
(H1-Hn) and an object whose geometric position is to be 

detected, with the features: 

the device with magnetic field source provides the 
Hall element arrangement (H1-Hn) with a magnetic 

induction which is dependent on the relative geometric 
position between the Hall element arrangement 

and the object, 
the Hall element arrangement converts this geometry-dependent 
magnetic induction into an analog electric 

signal, 
the Hall elements are arranged at a prescribed 
distance from one another along a prescribed line, 
an interpolation circuit (IPS) is provided which 
interpolates the analog output signals of in each 

case at least two Hall elements to form a common 
analog output signal, characterized in that the 

interpolation circuit for each Hall element 
(H1,...,Hn) a difference amplifier stage (D

signal output (I + / oi, I - / oi; I + / oj, I - / oj) combined to forma 

common current node (ΣI

amplifiers have an amplification which in each case 

is adjusted individually. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 

in that the distances between two adjacent Hall elements 
are of identical size in each case. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 or 2,  
 

characterized in that the Hall elements are arranged 
along a straight line. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the Hall elements are arranged 

along a curved line. 
Arrangement according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the Hall element arrangement 

and the interpolation circuit are monolithically 
integrated together. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a difference amplifier stage consists of two 

transistors whose emitters are connected via a current 
source (I
oi

terminals the input voltage can be fed and at whose 

collectors the output current can be tapped. 
Arrangement according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that a resistor (R

Arrangement according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that a collector component current (I ' / K) is 

fed, via a further collector terminal of a transistor, to 
the respective collector terminal of the other 

transistor. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that an isolating amplifier (V

present which is connected upstream of the input of a 

difference amplifier stage (DV
