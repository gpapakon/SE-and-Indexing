<ABSTRACT>
In response to a registered hall call, a car 
announcement is made when and only when an assigned car, 

of a plurality, has its RRT a calculated number of 
seconds lower than the car with the next lowest RRT to 

minimize actual waiting time wherein the calculation is 
performed as a function of the remaining response time 

of the assigned car, the waiting time of the passenger, 
and an RRT inflation factor which is an amount of 

deviation from the minimum expected remaining response 
time of the assigned car.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to elevator
dispatching, and in particular to the time for
announcement to passengers waiting in the hallway of a
car to serve a hall call.In response to a registered hall call,
conventional elevator dispatching logic provides for
audio or visual announcement of the assigned car in the
hallway when the assigned car reaches a commitment
point. The commitment point is defined as the location
of the elevator at which it begins deceleration. The
announcement is made no later than the commitment point
because at that point the car must stop at the floor and
there is not much advantage to delaying the
announcement. In conventional logic, the announcement
is made no sooner because an elevator dispatcher which
controls the assignment of cars to hall calls uses the
time between registration and announcement to make the
best assignment. This announcement gives the passenger
approximately two seconds notice before the car doors
begin to open. An example of this conventional
dispatching logic is the RSR scheme in "Relative System
Response Elevator Call Assignments", U.S. Patent
4,815,568.A drawback of RSR is that while waiting for an
elevator, a passenger naturally becomes anxious about
which car will arrive, and the level of anxiety
increases as the waiting time grows. This level of
anxiety could be greatly reduced. The Japanese elevator market requires the
announcement of the car as soon as the waiting passenger
registers his/her hall call. This feature is commonly
referred to as ICA, or Instantaneous Car Assignment.EP-A-0508438 discloses a method of notifying a user
of an arriving elevator car in response to a hall call,
wherein notification occurs a threshold time before
elevator car arrival.The problem with ICA is that often a car which
appears to be an excellent candidate for a first
assignment when the hall call is registered can become
delayed by its assignment to hall calls and car calls
entered after the first assignment. This can lead to a
call that waits a very long time, which is more than 60
seconds. Assignment of the hall call, for example, may
be to the car with the shortest Remaining Response Time
(RRT). RRT is an estimation of the amount of time
required for an elevator to reach the commitment point
of the floor at which the hall call is registered, given
the car calls and hall calls to which the elevator car
is committed. Alternatively, Remaining Response Time
may be defined as an estimation of the amount of time
required for an elevator to reach the floor at which
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of announcing to a waiting passenger which
elevator car of a plurality of elevator cars (1-6) will

serve a hall call registered by said waiting passenger,
comprising:


temporarily assigning a car to answer said hall
call, said car being the assigned car; and
measuring the remaining response time (RRT) for each
car of said plurality, in response to registration of

the hall call, wherein said RRT for a car is an
estimation of the time required for an elevator to reach

the commitment point of the floor at which the hall call
is registered, given the car calls and hall calls to

which the car is committed; characterised by
providing an RRT inflation factor of said assigned
car as a function of the number of potential stops for

the assigned car between the position of the assigned
car at a given time and the floor of hall call

registration, indicative of the likelihood that the RRT
of said assigned car will become inflated because of the

assignment of the car assigned to the registered hall
call to future hall calls or car calls;
committing the assigned car to service said hall
call and announcing the assignment to the waiting

passenger when the assigned car has its RRT at least a
calculated number of seconds lower than the car with the

next lowest RRT, wherein said number of seconds is
selected as a function of the RRT inflation factor.
The method of claim 1 wherein said number of seconds
is provided in response to the amount of time said 

waiting passenger has waited since registration of the
hall call, the RRT inflation factor of the assigned car

and the RRT of the assigned car.

seconds is provided by:
