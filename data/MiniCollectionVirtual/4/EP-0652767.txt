<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of hGH, hGRF, hIGF-1, hIGF-2 or analogs of these or a mixture of two or more of these, alone or in conjunction with lactational enhancers for the treatment of human lactation failure. It also relates to the use of hGH, hGRF, hIGF-1, hIGF-2 or analogs of these or a mixture of two or more of these, alone or in conjunction with lactational enhancers for the manufacturing of a medicament for the treatment of human lactation failure, also a prophylactic treatment. Preferably human growth hormone is used. The invention also relates to a method for the treatment of human lactation failure, as well as compositions and methods for their manufacturing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of human growth hormone (hGH), human growth
hormone releasing factor (hGRF), human insulin-like growth factor (hIGF-1 and hIGF-2
) or analogs of these or a mixture of two or more of these, alone or in conjunction with
one or more lactation enhancers for the manufacture of a composition for the
treatment of human lactation failure.Endogenous Growth Hormone (GH) plays an important role in the establishment
(mammogenesis) and maintenance (lactogenesis) of ruminant lactation (Cowie et al. In
"Lactation", 123-140 Ed. I R Falconer 1971, Vines et al. J. Dairy Sci 60: 1949-1957,
1977).
It is known that serum levels of endogenous GH are greater in high yielding than low
yielding cows (Hart et al, Endocr. 77:333-345, 1978) and in animal studies it has been
shown that a synergistic effect of GH together with other lactogenic hormones is
obtained in the development of the mammary gland (Tucker J. Dairy Sci 64: 6: 1403-1421,
1981).
The site of action of GH is less clear, as limited animal studies have failed to show
binding of labelled GH to mammary tissue, suggesting GH receptors are not present in
the gland in significant concentrations.
Recent advances in understanding the mode of action of GH via insulin-like growth
factors and the identification of various growth factors in mammary secretions suggest
that GH may mediate its effect on the mammary gland via insulin-like growth factors
(IGFs). (Phillips et al NEJM 302: 371-378, 1980, Baxter et al J. Clin Endocrinol Metab 
58: 955-959, 1984, Corps et al J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab 67; 25-29, 1988) although
there is contradictory data (Davis et al. J Endocrinol 123,33, 1989).
It is not known if these growth factors are produced locally, or transferred from the
maternal circulation and what influence maternal and milk levels of these peptides have
on initial lactation, maintenance of lactation and neonatal growth.For many years it has also been known that exogenous GH will significantly increase
the milk yield in cattle (Machlin et al. J. Dairy Sci 56: 575-580, 1973) although close
arterial infusions of GH into the mammary gland of ruminants does not increase milk
yield, suggesting an indirect effect (Mc Dowell et al. Aust J Biol Sciences 40, 181 - 189.
1987).The mechanism of GH-potentiated boosting of milk yields remains unknown, although
several lines of research suggest that the most likely mode of action is via insulin-like
growth factors acting either directly or indirectly. IGFs have now been found in the
mammary secretions of
