<ABSTRACT>
A decorative sheet for construction is disclosed. The decorative 
sheet for construction comprises a thermoplastic polyester resin 

foam forming a surface layer, a large number of inorganic 
aggregates scattered over the surface of the foam in the presence 

of an adhesive, said inorganic aggregates forming a decorative face 
layer by the medium of the adhesive, and a backing layer formed on 

the decorative face layer. The decorative sheet of the present 
invention enables its decorative face layer with a backing layer to 

be reliably and readily transferred to the surface of concrete 
construction or products, and yet which enables a foam layer as a 

protective layer for the decorative face layer with a backing layer 
to be readily removed after application. A decorative concrete 

product for construction using the same, and processes for 
preparing them are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decorative sheet for
construction, a decorative concrete product for construction
using the decorative sheet, and processes for preparing them. In
particular, it relates to a decorative sheet for construction
which enables a decorative layer with a backing layer having a
natural stone-like pattern or the like to be transferred to an
interior or exterior surface of a construction such as a wall, a
gatepost, a fence, a passage, a poolside, a pavement, a curb of a
road or of a plot in a park, or a surface of other various types of
constructions; a decorative concrete product with such a decorative
layer with a backing layer transferred thereto by the use of the
decorative sheet; and a processes for preparing them.To decorate interior and exterior surfaces of constructions
and/or to impart improved water resistance thereto, various
surface finishes are generally given to inner and outer walls,
and floors of constructions and the like.For example, in application of inner and outer walls and a
floor in a construction site, there has heretofore been conducted 
such a procedure by a skilled artisan that a mixture of a
concrete or mortar with an aggregate is prepared in situ and
applied, and thereafter, the surface of the resultant is
subjected to so-called scrubbed finish by partially scrubbing it
off with water or so-called scraped finish by partially scraping
it off with a wire brush, or coated with a coating, or tiled.
Alternatively, in a case of a construction of large scale,
surface-decorated large-sized interior or exterior concrete
products such as precast concrete panels or precast concrete
blocks are preliminarily manufactured in a factory, and
transported into a construction site and constructed there into
inner or outer walls and the like.By the various types of surface finish, aesthetic appearance
and solid-looking are imparted to constructions and/or
practically desired durability, water resistance and the like are
effectively attained. In such various types of finish, in
particular scrubbed finish, scraped finish and the like, however,
technical skills of skilled artisans are required, and yet it is
difficult to attain appearance with just intended pattern and/or
color. Further, such finishing operations are likely, from the
nature thereof, to be prevented from being carried out in rainy
days, i.e., these finishing operations have great problem of
susceptibility to weather.To solve these disadvantages inherent in such finishing
operations on constructions, a

A decorative sheet for construction comprising:

a surface layer (1),
a large number of inorganic aggregates (3)
scattered over the surface layer (1) in the

presence of an adhesive (2), said inorganic
aggregates forming a decorative face layer by the

medium of the adhesive, and
a backing layer (4) formed on the decorative layer,

characterized in that the surface layer (1) is formed by
a thermoplastic polyester resin foam.
The decorative sheet for construction according to claim
1, wherein the thermoplastic polyester resin foam

forming a surface layer (1) is a foam of a polyethylene
terephthalate or polyethylene naphthalate.
The decorative sheet for construction according to claim
1, wherein the thermoplastic polyester resin foam

forming a surface layer (1) is a foam sheet having a
thickness of about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm.
The decorative sheet for construction according to claim
1, further comprising inorganic aggregates (5) studded

over the backing layer (4).
The decorative sheet for construction according to claim
1, wherein a large number of the inorganic aggregates

(3) scattered between the surface layer (1) and the
backing layer (4) are fragments of a natural stone or

ceramics. 
The decorative sheet for construction according to claim
1, wherein a large number of the inorganic aggregates

(3) scattered between the surface layer (1) and the
backing layer (4) are a mixture of aggregates having

different sizes.
The decorative sheet for construction according to claim
1, wherein the backing layer (4) is formed of a material

selected from the group consisting of a cement admixture
resin, a soft cement mortar and a resilient mortar.
