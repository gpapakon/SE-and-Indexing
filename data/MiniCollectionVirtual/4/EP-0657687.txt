<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for improving the efficiency of a
power station or the like operated by combustion of

fossil fuels, comprising the preheating of the combustion
air by recovery of a portion of the heat contained in the

flue gas, and the transfer of a portion of the heat
contained in the flue gas to the process medium by means

of bypassing the preheating of the combustion air, the
combustion air being preheated by process medium of low

pressure before entering the air preheater (4), and heat
being extracted from the flue gas carried in a first

bypass (6) of the air preheater (4) in order to heat
process medium which is under higher pressure,

characterized in that, in order to heat process medium
which is under higher pressure, heat contained in the

preheated combustion air is additionally extracted by
combustion air heated in the air preheater (4) being

recirculated in a second bypass (6a) of the air preheater
(4).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the heat quantity (Q
2
, Q
2a
) delivered to high-pressure
feedwater or high-pressure steam in the first

and second bypass (6, 6a) corresponds to the heat
quantity (Q
1
) fed in a low-pressure preheater (5) to the
combustion air upstream of the air preheater (4) by low-pressure

feedwater or low-pressure steam.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the combustion-air preheater (4) is

of multi-stage design, only the stage(s) lying in the
higher temperature range being bypassed by the bypass (6

or 6a).
