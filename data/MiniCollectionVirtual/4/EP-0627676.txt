<ABSTRACT>
A method is proposed for the electronic supervision and control of the opening and closing process of electrically operated units, in which, for the purpose of reducing considerably the components necessary for determining the adjusting parameters of the unit involved whilst maintaining an as simple as possible method, a period is calculated by the microcomputer of the control electronics, synchronously with the sensor signal (S), in which period the counting unit counts positive edges of the sensor signal determined by the sensor element in the direction of the adjusting direction prevailing before the instant of reversal (tr), and a time range is calculated, after the expiry of which positive edges of the sensor signal are counted by the counting unit in the opposite direction to the adjusting direction, prevailing before the instant of reversal (tr), of the unit involved.

Technique for electronically controlling and monitoring the opening and closing process 
of electrically driven aggregates (7) equipped with a protective device against trapping, 

especially window openers and sliding roofs in vehicles, whereby an electrical motor (1) of the 

aggregate concerned is connected to the electrical system and can be driven in two directions 
of rotation and is indirectly influenced by way of electrical control elements (2) and directly by 

way of a sensor device which registers the regulating parameters pertaining causally to the 
relevant aggregate and relating to the adjustment direction, the position and the adjusting 

speed, and with controlling electronics (4) which are connected in series and comprise a 
microcomputer with counting unit, 
characterized by the fact that
 
a single sensor element (5) registering the regulating parameters pertains to the electrical motor 

(1) ofthe relevant aggregate whereby, in order to unequivocally identify the adjustment 
direction and the position of the relevant aggregate (7), the previously measured period (T
p
) of 
the sensor signal (S) is used as the basis for the cut-off time (T
a
) determined by way of a 
calculating programme filed in the microcomputer (3) of the controlling electronics (4) and 

whereby the ascertained cut-off period (T
a
) is synchronously taken into comparison as a 
limiting value with the subsequently measured period (T
p+1
) ofthe sensor signal (S) for the 
purpose of determining the reversing time (t
r
) (change of direction of rotation of the electrical 
motor (1)), and by which upon determination of the reversing time (t
r
) a period (T
u
) is 
calculated by the microcomputer (3) synchronous to the sensor signal (S) on the basis of the 

regulating parameters determined at this point of time and during the said period (T
u
) the 
counting unit counts the positive sides of impulse of the sensor signal (S) in the direction of the 

prevailing adjustment direction of the relevant aggregate determined by the sensor element (5) 
prior to the reversing time (t
r
), and a time range (T
u1
) is calculated by the microcomputer after 
which the positive sides of impulse of the sensor signal (S) determined by the sensor element 

(5) are counted by the counting unit in the direction opposing the adjustment direction of the 
relevant aggregate prevailing prior to the reversing time (t
r
). 
Technique in accordance with Claim 1, characterized by the fact that the operating 
voltage existing at the time is implemented by the calculating programme for calculating the 

duration of the cutoff period (T
a
).  
 
Technique in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 2, characterized by the fact that the 
sensor element (5) is designed as a Hall sensor. 
Technique in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 2, characterized by the fact that the 
sensor element (5) is designed as a light barrier. 
Technique in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized by the fact that the 
path to be taken during the opening and closing process of the relevant aggregate is divided 

into three sectors (9, 10, 11), namely into a first sector (9) ranging from completely open to 
about half open, a second sector (10) ranging from about half open until almost completely 

closed and in a third sector (11) ranging from almost completely closed to completely closed, 
whereby the regulating parameters for the opening and closing process relevant to the 

protection device against trapping are only taken into consideration if the aggregate is in the 
second sector (10), the socalled safety sector. 
Technique in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized by the fact that 
several aggregates are coordinated into a system whereby the sensor signals of the individual 

sensor elements (5) pertaining to the aggregates are communicated to centrally positioned 
controlling electronics (4).
