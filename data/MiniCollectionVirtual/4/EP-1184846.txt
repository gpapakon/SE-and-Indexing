<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic transfer method for magnetically transferring information signals such as servo signals from a master medium to a slave medium, capable of reducing a range of signal missing due to insufficient contact of the two mediums originating from an adhering substance, thus enhancing signal quality. When the master medium bearing an information signal and the slave medium are brought into close contact with each other, a transferring magnetic field is applied thereto, thus magnetically transferring the information signal from the master medium to the slave medium. An elastic member made of a material having an elastic property so as to deform in accordance with a surface shape of the slave medium during contact pressure application and to restore to an original surface shape thereof during release of the slave medium from the master medium can be interposed between a back of the slave medium and a pressing surface of a pressing support member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of magnetically
transferring magnetic information signals held in a master medium
to a slave medium.The magnetic transfer method is one for magnetically
transferring magnetic patterns corresponding to magnetic
information (for example, servo signals) held in a master medium
to a slave medium by applying transferring magnetic field in a
state where the master medium and the slave medium are in close
contact with each other. This magnetic transfer method is disclosed,
for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos.
63(1988)-183623, 10(1998)-40544, 10(1998)-269566 and the like.However, if an adhering substance exists between the master
medium and the slave medium in magnetically transferring the
magnetic pattern from the master medium to the slave medium (during
magnetic transfer), a space is created between the master medium
and the slave medium in the vicinity of the adhering substance
to cause an insufficient contact, and hence an area is created,
where no magnetic transfer is executed. If such an area is created,
where no magnetic transfer is executed, the magnetic information 
is not transferred at this area, and signal missing occurs in the
magnetic information transferred to the slave medium. Thus, the
signal quality is lowered. When the recorded signals are servo
signals, a satisfactory tracking function cannot be obtained, and
reliability of reproducing the information signals is lowered.Specifically, as schematically shown in Fig. 3, during
magnetic transfer, an information bearing plane of a master medium
3 and a magnetic recording surface of a slave medium 2 are made
to contact each other, and by pressing a back of the slave medium
2 against the information bearing plane of the master medium 3
with a pressing support member 5, the information bearing plane
and the magnetic recording surface are made to be in close contact
with each other. In this state, a transferring magnetic field is
applied to the master medium 3 and the slave medium 2 by magnetic
field generating means (not shown) , and information such as servo
signals is magnetically transferred and recorded onto the slave
medium 2 from the master medium 3. However, if an adhering substance
P (particle) is adhered onto the surface of either the master medium
3 or the slave medium 2, when a pressure for allowing the master
medium 3 and the slave medium 2 to be brought into close contact
with each other is applied thereto, a gap is created in the vicinity
of the adhering substance P
