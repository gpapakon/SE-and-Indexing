 SKIN THERAPEUTIC MIXTURE CONTAINING COLD-PROCESSED ALOE VERA EXTRACT, WITH YELLOW SAP AND ALOIN REMOVEDBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to topical formulations for treatment of damaged skin, such as irradiated skin in combination with wound treatment. In particular, the invention relates to topical formulations useful for the treatment of skin damaged by the harmful effects of radiation and radioactive substances, such as used in the treatment of cancer or exposure to the sun, open sores, wounds and abrasions.2. Description of the Prior ArtAccording to the American Cancer Society's Cancer Facts and Figures-1991, at the current rate, about 76 million Americans now living will eventually have cancer. It will strike three of four families. Cancer strikes at any age. It kills more children of age 1 to 14 in the United States than any other disease and occurs more frequently with age. Based on current medical technology over half of these cancer patients will undergo some form of radiation therapy.In the 1930's, less than one in five was alive at least five years after treatment. In the 1940's, it was one in four, and in the 1960's, it was one in three. Today about 440,000 Americans, or 4 of 10 patients who get cancer, will be alive five years after diagnosis. The gain from 1 in 3 to 4 in 10 represents about 77,000 persons this year.The primary goal of the medical community has been to prolong the life of cancer patients. Until recently, and in relation to the growing number of cancer patients that can expect to survive five years or more, the quality of life of the cancer patient has received attention.The onset of radiodermatitis as a result of irradiation in cancer patients is well documented. It is characterized by congestive or exudative redness of the skin 

 caused by hyperthermia. Therefore, there is a need for substances effective for treating irradiated skin damage or radiodermatitis.The topical use of anti-inflammatory agents to alleviate radiodermatitis is known. Such compositions contain combinations of one or more steroidal anti- inflammatories, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, as well as "natural" anti- inflammatories, such as an extract of aloe vera.The "greying of America" is also well documented. People are living longer and have expectations for a quality life as well as a long life. People afflicted with long term illness run the risk of getting bed sores, pressure sores and a myriad of skin irritations due to incontinence.Looking at the
