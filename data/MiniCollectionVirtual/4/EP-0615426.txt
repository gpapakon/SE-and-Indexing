<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
ultrasonic imaging and, in particular, to an ultrasonic 
probe assembly with the ultrasonic transducer arranged 
for insertion into a body cavity with the features of the preamble 
part of claim 1. Such an ultrasonic probe assembly having the 
ultrasonic transducer arranged for insertion into a body 
cavity (i.e. prostate probes, esophageal probes, vaginal 
probes) is known from EP-A2-0317049. The ultrasonic 
transducer, the transducer mount mechanism and the motor 
which imparts scanning movement to the ultrasonic 
transducer are housed at one end of an endoscope. Power 
to the motor and electrical signals, from which the image 
is developed, are conducted along wires extending through  
 
the endoscope. Moreover, 
the cables 
by which the scan plane of the ultrasonic transducer is 
changed mechanically extend through the endoscope to the 
transducer mount mechanism from a control remote from the 
transducer mount mechanism, whereby a corresponding housing 
between the transducer and the control is relatively stiff. It is apparent that the sizes of the ultrasonic 
transducer, the transducer mount mechanism and the 
scanning motor dictate the size of the housing inserted 
into the body cavity. Often, the size of this housing is 
too large for the desired applications of the ultrasonic 
probe assembly. Further, this known ultrasonic probe assembly 
is not flexible along its length for guiding the transducer within 
a body cavity to a certain position.  
 It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an 
ultrasonic probe assembly of reduced size and of enhanced 
flexibility for simplified guiding and positioning of an 
ultrasound transducer within a body cavity. The aforementioned object is solved by an ultrasonic probe 
assembly with the features of claim 1. This ultrasonic probe 
assembly comprises flexible connecting means within flexible 
housing extending between the ultrasonic transducer and, for 
example, control means for the ultrasonic probe assembly. These 
flexible connecting means and the flexible housing have a length 
which permits positioning the first housing with the ultrasonic 
transducer within the body cavity of the patient while the second 
housing remains outside the body. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are disclosed by the 
sub-claims. Moreover, the present invention can be incorporated in an 
endscope.

embodiment of an ultrasonic probe assembly constructed in
