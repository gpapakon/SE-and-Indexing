<ABSTRACT>
An attenuated hinge spring assembly (26) for a trunk 
lid (22) of an automotive vehicle includes a coiled spring 

(30) which is connected to a bracket (28) secured to the 
vehicle, a threaded stud (38) which is secured to the 

bracket (28), a plate (32) which is slidably mounted on 
the bracket (28) and the stud (38), a nut (42) rotatably 

attached to said threaded stud (38) and selectively secured 
to an arm (46), and a washer (44) which lies between the 

plate (32) and the nut (42). The plate (32) lies adjacent 
to the coiled spring (30). The arm (46) is pivotally 

connected to the trunk lid (22) and to the bracket (28). 
The spring (30) is connected to the stud (38) and the arm 

(46) and uncoils as the arm (46) pivots from a lowered 
position to a raised position to move the lid (22) between 

a lowered position and a raised position. When the lid 
(22) is raised, the arm (46) rotates which causes the nut 

(42) to rotate and translate along the stud (38), which in 
turn causes the washer (44) and plate (32) to translate 

along said stud (38). The plate (32) moves against the 
coiled spring (30) and frictionally brakes the spring and 

the nut (42) to slow the movement of the lid (22) as it is 
being raised.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to a hinge spring 
assembly for a lid, such, for example, as a boot or trunk 
lid of an automotive vehicle for slowing the momentum of 
the lid as the lid pivots from a lowered position to a 
raised position. Current trunk lids use a stop mechanism to stop the 
movement of the lid when the lid reaches the fully raised 
position. When a trunk lid is opened, a need to prevent 
the trunk lid from suddenly banging into the stop exists in 
order to prevent damage to the trunk lid or related hinge 
structure. This is especially important in the case of 
remotely actuated trunk opening devices since the operator 
is not there to slow the momentum of the trunk lid as it 
raises. Some trunks include elongated gas springs or springs 
with little force that allow the trunk lid to be moved to 
a raised position. These types of assemblies require that 
the operator manually open the trunk to the raised position 
and cannot be used in a remotely actuated application. The present invention is intended to overcome or 
minimize all of these problems, as well as to present 
several other improvements. According to this invention a hinge spring assembly 
for a lid, comprising:
 
   a bracket mountable in a fixed position adjacent the 
lid;
 
   a coiled spring connected to said bracket; and
 
   an arm member having a first end portion operatively 
inter-connectable with said lid, and a second end portion 
operatively inter-connected with said spring for movement 
of said arm member between a first position and a second 
position for moving the lid between a closed position and 
an open position, said coiled spring uncoiling when said 
arm member is moved between the first position and the 
second position;
 
 
   is characterised in that the assembly also includes 
means for frictionally restraining movement of said coiled 
spring when said lid is moved toward said second position 
to slow the movement of the lid as the lid moves to said 
second position. Such a spring hinge assembly is particularly useful 
for an automotive vehicle for controlling the movement and 
momentum of a trunk lid as the lid moves from a lowered 
position to a raised position. It may also be used in an 
operator actuated opening of a lid or a remotely actuated 
opening of the trunk lid. By progressively varying the 
spring force delivered to the lid in accordance with 
movement of the lid between a closed position and an open 
position the hinge assembly is capable of slowing movement 
and decreasing momentum

<CLAIMS>
A hinge spring assembly (20) for a lid (22), 
comprising: 

   a bracket (28) mountable in a fixed position adjacent 
the lid (22); 

   a coiled spring (30) connected to said bracket (28); 
and 

   an arm member (46) having a first end portion 
operatively inter-connectable with said lid (22), and a 

second end portion operatively inter-connected with said 
spring (30) for movement of said arm member (46) between a
