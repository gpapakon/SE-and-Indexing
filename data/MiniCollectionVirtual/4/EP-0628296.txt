<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive control system for an artificial limb has a 
piston and cylinder assembly (18) for controlling knee joint (10) 

flexion, an electronically driven motorised valve (18D) for 
varying the damping effect of the assembly (18), a proximity 

sensor (24) for sensing knee flexion, and a processor circuit (32) for 
mounting on the limb. The system also has a radio receiver (30) 

connected to the processor circuit (32) and an operator control 
unit (40) for remote transmission of command signals to the 

receiver (30). In a teach mode, the system allows an operator to 
increment the valve (18D) opening by remote control to optimise 

operation of the limb, and to cause the processor circuit (32) to 
record selected valve openings in conjunction with average 

step period values which are produced automatically by the 
system during use of the limb. Recording a new selected 

valve opening causes the processor circuit (32) on the limb 
automatically to calculate a set of control data relating 

valve openings to walking speed ranges. This set of control 
data is used in a playback mode of the system for 

automatically adjusting the valve opening during normal use 
of the limb.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adaptive prosthesis control
system and a control method with specific relevance to the
electrical control of knee flexion and/or extension in a
lower limb prosthesis for an above-knee amputee.British Patent Application No. GB 2216426A discloses a lower
limb prosthesis having a pneumatic cylinder assembly
interconnecting the thigh and shin components of the
prosthesis to provide resistance to knee flexion and
extension during the swing phase of the walking cycle. The
cylinder includes a valve which is adjustable using a
stepper motor to alter the degree of resistance according to
signals received from a microcomputer control system which
senses walking speed, so that resistance to movement of the
shin component about the knee axis during the swing phase is
varied as the walking speed varies. The control system is
patient-adaptable in the sense that its operation is adapted
to suit the individual amputee. This is achieved by
operating the control system initially in a teaching mode
and performing walking tests in which the system is
calibrated at different walking speeds to achieve the best
gait.Experience has shown that operating the system in a teaching
mode to achieve the best settings can be awkward and time
consuming. It is an object of this invention to provide an
improved control system which is more convenient in use.According to one aspect of this invention, there is provided
an adaptive prosthesis control system for an artificial limb
comprising a limb movement control device for mounting on
the limb, a sensor for generating electrical sensor signals
in response to movement of the limb, and an electronic
processing circuit which is electrically coupled to the
sensor and the control device, and which includes (a) data 
generating means operable in a teach mode and a playback
mode of the processing circuit automatically and repeatedly
to generate measurement data values related to the speed of
operation of the limb in response to the sensor signals, (b)
control device setting means for adjusting a parameter of
the control device, and (c) storage means (38) for storing
a set of control data representing a relationship between
speed of limb operation and control device settings, the
setting means being operable during the playback mode as the
limb is operated to process the resulting said measurement
data values in conjunction with the stored set of control
data to generate the said setting signals for the control
device, whereby the control device is automatically
