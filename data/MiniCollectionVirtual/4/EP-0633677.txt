<ABSTRACT>
A receiver is disclosed for a DS/CDMA communication system 
wherein a symbol is spread with a predetermined spread code to 

produce a DS/CDMA signal which is transmitted on a radio frequency 
carrier. The receiver includes an interference canceller for cancelling 

signals from undesired sources introduced to a signal received from a 
desired source using a feedback signal. A phase variation canceller is 

provided for cancelling a phase variation that occurs in an interval 
between successive symbols of the received signal. Both cancellers are 

connected in series. A decision circuit compares an input signal from the 
interference canceller or from the phase variation canceller with a 

threshold and produces an output representing one of two discrete values 
depending on whether it is higher or lower than the threshold. A 

correction circuit derives a correction signal from a signal produced by the 
interference canceller and applies it to the interference canceller as the 

feedback signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to direct sequence/code
division multiple access (DS/CDMA) cellular mobile communication
systems, and more specifically to a DS/CDMA receiver which is
particularly suitable for use in cell-site stations.Commercial interest in DS/CDMA communication systems has
recently risen dramatically due to their potential ability to provide service
to more users than is offered by other access techniques. In the
DS/CDMA system, each mobile station includes a channel encoder and a
multiplier for multiplying the output of the encoder with a distinct spread
code. The output of the multiplier is modulated on a carrier for
transmission. Signals from mobile stations are code division multiplexed
with other signals within the same frequency spectrum, and the signal at
the input of each DS/CDMA cell-site receiver is therefore a sum of the
signals from the mobile stations. At a cell-site station, a plurality of CDMA
receivers are provided, one for each mobile station. Each cell-site receiver
multiplies a received bit sequence with a distinct spread code, which may
be preassigned or assigned on an as-needed basis, so that signals from
undesired mobile stations are "spread" over the frequency spectrum of
the system and become noise, while the components of the desired
signal are "despread" into a signal having a significant amplitude. The
noise resulting from the spreading of undesired signals may be
insignificant if the number of mobile stations is small. However, the noise
level will have an interfering effect on the desired signal if the number of
mobile stations increases.For interference cancellation, a multiuser DS/CDMA receiver that 
utilizes the spread codes of all mobile user is described in a paper titled
"Near-Far Resistance of Multiuser Detectors in Asynchronous Channels",
Ruxandra Lupas et al, IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol., 38, No.
4, April 1990, pages 496-508. However, it is complex and impractical in
certain cases that each mobile user has the knowledge of all other spread
codes. A single user receiver using the spread code of its own receiver for
interference cancellation is in a paper "Equalization for Interference
Cancellation in Spread Spectrum Multiple Access Systems", M.
Abdulrahman et al, Proceedings of VTC '92, May 1992, pages 71-74.
This single user receiver cancels interference by using an equalizer. The
output of the equalizer is applied to a decision circuit whose output is
coupled to a channel decoder. A matched filter (despreading filter) may
be
