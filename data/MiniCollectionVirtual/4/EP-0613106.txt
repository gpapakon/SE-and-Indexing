<ABSTRACT>
An automatic vending machine for supplying a drink in a 
cup. A predetermined amount of ice is supplied from an ice 

making machine with rapidity and stability. The vending 
machine comprises: an ice making machine; an ice chute for 

feeding the ice discharged from the ice making machine into 
a cup; a sensor for detecting the ice passing through the 

ice chute and outputting an ice passage signal; and a 
controller for detecting the amount of ice discharged from 

the ice making machine and controlling the ice discharging 
operation of the ice making machine on the basis of the ice 

passage signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to what is called a
cupped drink automatic vending machine for vending a drink
such as iced coffee which is put into a cup when a predetermined
coin or bill is inserted into a slit.A conventional cupped drink automatic vending machine
is provided with a cup feeder, a plurality of
material feeders accommodating materials such as coffee,
milk and sugar, a diluent feeder for feeding a diluent such
as water and hot water, and an ice feeder for feeding ice,
as described in, for example, Japanese Utility Model
Laid-Open No. Sho 62-199855 (G07F13/06).When a customer inserts a coin or a bill into a slit
and a drink is selected, the vending operation is started.
A cup is dropped from the cup feeder and transferred by a
transferring means to the position where a material is fed.
After the material is fed into the cup, the cup is next
moved to the position where the dilute is fed. After the
dilute is fed, the cup is moved to the position where ice is
fed from the ice feeder, and ice is finally put into the
cup.The ice feeder in this type of automatic vending
machine is generally composed of an auger ice making 
machine for producing ice chips. The ice making machine
produces ice and stores a predetermined amount of ice in a
storage tank. When the cup is transferred to the predetermined
position at which ice is supplied during the vending
operation, the door for closing the ice discharge port is
held open for a predetermined time, so that ice chips are
discharged and dropped into the cup through an ice chute.However, the ice making performance of such an ice
making machine is generally about 2 kg/h. If cups of
drink are continuously bought, the ice making performance
cannot meet the demand. Since an agitator for discharging
ice is continuously driven in the storage tank of the ice
making machine, when the amount of ice discharged per unit
time is small, the edges of ice chips in the storage tank
are rounded. In this manner, ice chips are smoothly discharged
from the storage tank with a good fluidity.On the other hand, when the amount of ice discharged
per unit time is large, the angular ice chips which have
been newly produced are discharged, so that the fluidity of
ice chips is bad and they are difficult to discharge from
the ice tank.Consequently, in the system in which the ice discharge
port is opened for a predetermined time as in the conventional
ice making machine, the amount of ice put into the
cup is not constant. This condition is shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the
