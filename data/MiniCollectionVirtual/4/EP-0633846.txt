<ABSTRACT>
A method of automatic washing of vehicles (1), wherein recirculation and reuse of a substantial proportion of the washing liquid takes place during the washing procedure proper and wherein a principle of counter-flow is used, whereby the vehicle (1) will be washed in a dirtier washing liquid during early treatment states than in later ones. The vehicle is positioned in at least one treatment station (2, 16, 22), where a plurality of the treatment steps are then carried out, and in the first treatment step treatment liquid (3) is supplied from a first treatment tank (4) and is sprayed onto the vehicle together with additives, if any, and together with impurities originating from the vehicle the liquid thus supplied flows through openings in the floor and is returned to the first treatment tank (4). In this manner a substantial proportion of the treatment liquid is reused and in the following treatment step treatment liquid is supplied from a second treatment tank (7) to be sprayed onto the vehicle together with additives, if any, and is then, after drainage, returned to the second treatment tank (7), and so on, to be used in the subsequent treatment step, so that in each treatment step a treatment tank (18, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 24) specific for that particular treatment step is used and reuse of a substantial proportion of the treatment liquid takes place. Each treatment tank is also replenished with a supplementary amount (11-15, 27, 28) of liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method for automatic 
washing and rinsing of vehicles, 
as referred to in the preamble of claim 1 and disclosed in 
DE-A-2 512 992. Washing of passenger cars, buses and trucks is 
carried out in essentially two ways, i.e.manually or in 
automatic washing installations. The impurities which are 
removed from the car during the washing are flushed down 
the drains together with the spent detergent. In manual 
car-washing, detergents of cold-degreasing type usually 
are used. Such degreasing agents assist in dissolving oil 
and grease that otherwise would have remained on the 
vehicle. Following the treatment with the cold-degreasing 
agent a schampoo comprising surfactants, complexing agents 
and dispersing agents is used. In other words, considerable 
amounts of often environmentally harmful substances 
are emitted into the drains and end up in recipients or in 
the sewage disposal system. For example, engine oils often 
contain decomposition products that are very harmful to 
the environment, such as PCB (polychlorinated biphenyle) 
and the like. The mode of operation of car-wash installations 
varies according to season. In the wintertime, a cold-degreasing 
agent or a pre-wash including cold-degreasing 
agents is almost always used. Thereafter, the car is 
washed with some kind of schampoo, and is rinsed. The 
installations are equipped with oil separators designed to 
separate the oil and impurities dissolved in the oil. 
Impurities in the liquid phase follow the drainage water  
 
into the recipients or the sewage disposal system. 
Strangely enough, these conditions have been accepted for 
quite some time, although in Sweden alone between 40,000 
and 60,000 tons of degreasing products end up in the 
environment in some form in this way. Some attempts have 
been made to find environmentally more acceptable chemical 
products but as a rule such products are less efficient 
from a cleaning point of view. Washing with hot washing 
liquids could improve the cleaning power but would 
increase the energy costs to an unacceptable level, 
because in a conventional car-washing installation the hot 
washing liquid would be let out directly to the drains. On the whole, the development within the technology 
of automatic car-washing installations has concentrated on 
increasingly advanced mechanical means in the washing 
devices, introduction of flushing of the bottom faces of 
the engine and the chassis from below, of washing of the 
lateral faces of the wheels clean of asbestos

<CLAIMS>
A method for automatic washing and rinsing of 
vehicles (1), such as passenger cars, busses, trucks, 

trains, and the like, wherein recirculation and reuse of a 
substantial proportion of the washing liquid takes place 

during the washing procedure proper and wherein a 
principle of counter-flow is used, whereby the vehicle (1) 

will be washed in a dirtier washing liquid during early 
treatment stages than in later ones, the vehicle 

being positioned in at least one treatment station (2, 16, 
22), for example by either being driven or transported 

there, in which station(s) several treatment steps are 
carried out, during which in the first treatment step 

treatment liquid (3, 17) is supplied from a first treatment 
tank (18, 4) and is sprayed onto the vehicle together 

with additives, if any, and together with impurities 
originating from the vehicle the liquid thus supplied 

flows through openings in the floor and is returned to the 
first treatment tank (18, 4), thus causing reuse of a 

substantial proportion of the treatment liquid, and in the 
subsequent treatment step the treatment liquid (3, 6) is 

carried in the same manner from a second treatment tank 
(4, 7) and is sprayed onto the vehicle together with 

additives, if any, and is then, after drainage, returned 
to the second treatment tank (4, 7), 
characterized
 
in that this procedure is carried out in each 

subsequent one of the treatment steps by using in each 
treatment step a treatment tank (18, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 24) 

which is specific for that particular treatment step and 
which contains liquid from the corresponding treatment 

step that has been sprayed onto the vehicle as well as a 
supplementary replenishing amount (11-15, 27, 28) of 

liquid from the tank for the subsequent treatment step in 
compensation for liquid lost e.g. through evaporation, 

such that in this manner the treatment liquid sprayed onto  
 

the vehicle becomes increasingly cleaner in each treatment 
step, and impurities contained in a subsequent treatment 

tank are transferred to the tank for a preceding treatment 
step, such replenishment to the tank specific for that 

particular treatment step being effected, from the tank 
for the immediately subsequent treatment step, and this 

replenishment between tanks being effected between tanks 
used for rinsing and for washing immediately prior to 

rinsing. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the vehicle is placed in a treatment 

station (2) where a plurality of treatment steps are 
carried out, in that in at least the first one of said 

steps washing liquid (3), which preferably is heated, is 
carried from a first washing-liquid tank (4) and is sprayed 

onto the vehicle together with additives, if any, and 
the washing liquid thus supplied is returned to the first 

washing-liquid tank (4), which step is followed by at 
least one rinsing step using the associated rinsing-liquid 

tanks (7-10), essentially clean water being used in the 
last rinsing step, and followed, optionally, by at least 

one treatment step using an associated tank (24), in which 
step waxing liquid (23) from a waxing-liquid tank (24) is 

sprayed onto the vehicle. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the first treatment step in station 

(2) comprises spraying onto the vehicle, for instance from 
a tank (25), a degreasing agent containing a petroleum 

fraction, and also spraying washing liquid onto the vehicle, 
from a pre-treatment tank (18), and optionally 

repeating this procedure at least once, followed by at 
least one treatment step using the associated tank (4), in 

which step the vehicle is treated with a washing liquid 
containing a suitable detergent, followed by at least one 

treatment step using the associated tank (7-10), in which 
step the vehicle is rinsed with water which is substantialy 

free of additives, optionally followed by at least one 
treatment step using the associated tank (24), wherein  

 
waxing liquid (23) from a waxing-liquid tank (24) is 

sprayed onto the vehicle. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 3, 
characterized
 
in that at least the first vehicle 

treatment step is carried out in a separate pre-treatment 
station (16) wherein the vehicle is treated before it 

reaches the treatment station (2). 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1, 3 or 
4, 
characterized
 in that at least the last 
vehicle treatment step step is carried out in a separate 

wax-treatment station (22), in which step waxing liquid 
(23) is pumped from a waxing-liquid tank (24) and is 

sprayed onto the vehicle together with additives, if any, 
and the waxing liquid (23) thus supplied is made to flow 

through openings in the floor back to the waxing-liquid 
tank (24), thus causing reuse of a substantial proportion 

of the waxing liquid. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that washing liquid 
(11) from the washing-liquid tank (7) associated with the 

usually third vehicle treatment step is transferred to the 
tank (4) associated with the second treatment step, and 

from the tank (8) associated with the fourth treatment 
step washing liquid (12) is transferred to the tank (7) 

associated with the previous, i.e. the third treatment 
step, and so on, so that from the tank (10) associated 

with the second last treatment step washing liquid (14) is 
transferred to the
 tank (9), and the tank (10) associated 
with the second last treatment step is supplied from the 

exterior with essentially clean washing liquid (15), so 
that consequently impurities are transferred in the direction 

towards the tank (4) associated with the second 
treatment step and the transfer of washing liquid thus 

attributes to making the washing liquid cleaner upon each 
treatment step.  

 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that when a need 
for purification arises washing liquid is transferred from 

at least one washing-liquid tank (18, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10) to a 
filtering device (20), for example by way of a working 

tank (19), from which filtering device the cleaned washing 
liquid is returned, for instance by way of a clean-water 

tank (21), to at least one washing-liquid tank (18, 4, 7, 
8, 9, 10). 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that pressurized 
air is used to blow clean the lines leading from at least 

one of the collection pits (29, 30, 31) that are positioned 
in the treatment station (16, 2, 22) to the treatment 

tank in question (18, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 24) in order to 
shorten the duration of treatment in that treatment station.

claims, 
characterized
 in that at least one 
of the collection pits (29, 30, 31) is provided with a 

scraper mechanism effecting a scraping action downwards, 
along at least one bottom face of the pit in order to 

shorten the duration of treatment in the associated treatment 
station. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that as the need 
arises liquid is transferred from at least one treatment 

tank (18, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10), for instance by way of a 
collection tank (19), to a separation device (20) for 

cleaning, said separation device being e.g. a centrifugal 
device and/or a membrane type of filter, whereupon the 

cleaned liquid is supplied to at least one treatment tank 
(18, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10), for instance by way of a clean-water 

tank (21).
