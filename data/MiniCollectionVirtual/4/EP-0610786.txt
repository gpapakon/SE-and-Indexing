<ABSTRACT>
An insulation displacement termination system is 
provided for an input-output electrical connector which 

includes a dielectric housing (36) having a top face (32) 
and a bottom face (34) with a terminal-receiving passage 

(30) therebetween. At least one terminal includes an 
insulation displacement section (12) generally at the 

bottom face of the housing for termination to an insulated 
electrical conductor through a lower mouth (40) of the 

passage in the bottom face of the housing. The terminal 
includes a contact section (14) projecting through an open 

upper end (38) of the passage generally in the top face of 
the housing for engaging a complementary mating electrical 

component. The terminal is configured for insertion into 
the terminal-receiving passage through the lower mouth 

thereof. Complementary interengaging abutment means (21, 
42) are provided between the insulation displacement 

section of the terminal and the housing to define a stop-limit 
position of the terminal and to provide support for 

the insulation displacement section during termination to 
the insulated electrical conductor. Complementary 

interengaging latch means (28, 44) are provided between the 
contact section of the terminal and the housing within the 

passage for holding the terminal in the passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an insulation
displacement termination system for an input-output
electrical connector
according to the preamble of claim 1.There are many applications in the electronic
industry, such as in copying machines, computers and the
like, wherein a plurality of conductors must be terminated
to various electronic components to carry out various
functions of a machine or apparatus. For instance, in a
copying machine, control electronics are fed through data
conductors or lines and power conductors or lines to various
devices, such as motors, audible or visual indicators, or
the like which perform the various functions of the machine,
such as changing the reduction of the copying process,
varying the numbers of copies, rendering audible or visual
signals, and the like. Electronic components or devices,
such as printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips,
headers or connectors must be coupled through electrical
connectors to the power and data transmission conductors or
lines.An example of an electrical connector for use with
electronic systems of the character described above is shown
in U. S. Patent No. 5,125,846, dated June 30, 1992 and
assigned to the assignee of this invention. When the input-output
electrical connector shown in that patent is 
used to couple a printed circuit board to a plurality of
discrete insulated wire conductors, terminals are mounted in
the connector and each terminal has an insulation
displacement section at one end for termination to one of
the discrete insulated wire conductors and a contact section
at a second end for surface-mount engaging the printed
circuit board. The insulation displacement section or end of
the terminal is located generally at the bottom surface of
the connector, and the surface-mount engaging section or end
projects upwardly through a top surface of the connector.In the electrical connector system shown in the
5,125,846 patent, the terminals are top-loaded into the
connector. In other words, the insulation displacement
sections or ends of the terminals are inserted into
respective receiving cavities from the top of the connector.
The terminals are retained within the connector housing by
locking lances projecting from the terminals. The locking
lances are utilized to oppose the forces developed during
termination of an insulated wire conductor into the
insulation displacement section of the terminal. Although
the electrical connector shown in that patent has

An
input-output electrical connector which includes a

dielectric housing (36) having a top face (32) and a bottom
face (34) with a terminal-receiving passage (30)

therebetween, at least one terminal (10) including

an insulation displacement section (12) generally at
the bottom face of the housing for termination to an

insulated electrical conductor through a lower mouth (40) of
the passage (30) in the bottom face of the housing and
a contact section (14) at an opposite end thereof
wherein the

terminal (10) is configured for insertion into the
terminal-receiving passage (30) through the lower mouth (40)

thereof and including complementary interengaging abutment
means (21, 42) between the insulation displacement section

(12) of the terminal and the housing (36) within the passage
to define a stop-limit position of the terminal and to

provide support for the insulation displacement section
during termination to the insulated electrical conductor,

and complementary interengaging latch means (28, 44) between
the contact section (14) of the terminal and the housing

within the passage for holding the terminal in the passage,
wherein the terminal is fabricated of stamped and
formed sheet metal material,

characterized in that

said contact section (14) of
the terminal comprises an elongate base portion (22) extending 

transversely of the passage (30), and said complementary
interengaging latch means include a pair of

spring tabs (28) on opposite sides of the longitudinal edges of the base portion (22)
for camming into snap-latched positions behind

latch shoulders (44) of the housing, and a reverse-bend spring
contact portion (24) extends from an end of the base portion (22) and projects through an open upper

end of the passage, generally in the top face of the housing
for surface-mount engaging a complementary mating electrical

component, and said spring tabs (28) are
integral with said base portion.
The insulation displacement termination
system as set forth in claim 1, wherein

the
insulation displacement section (12) is formed by at least

one planar portion (16) having an insulation-piercing slot
(20) opening toward the mouth (40) of the passage, and said

complementary interengaging abutment means comprises a top
edge (21) of the planar portion for abutting against a

shoulder (42) of the housing within the passage.
The insulation displacement termination
system as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein the insulation

displacement section (12) of the terminal is formed by a
pair of planar portions (16) in a generally parallel

array with aligned insulation-piercing slots (20), both
planar portions including top edges (21) for the abutment

against shoulders (42) of the housing.
