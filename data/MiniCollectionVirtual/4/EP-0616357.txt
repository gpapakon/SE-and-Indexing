<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is, during a lighting operation of a metallic vapour 
discharge lamp, to maintain a suitable arc tube temperature, even if the lamp is 

operated at an input power higher than 160 W/cm of lighting length. 
According to the invention this object is achieved in that in the case of a metallic 
vapour discharge lamp, in which mercury, rare gas, iron and halogen are encapsulated 

within an arc tube and which is operated with an internal pressure of 0.5 to 
10 air pressure, an input power of higher than 160 W/cm of lighting length and 

within a heater having an air injection cooling system D ≦ 28 and simultaneously 
P/D ≦ 14, if an arc tube external diameter is designated D (mm) and an input 

power/cm of lighting length is designated P (W/m).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a metallic vapour discharge lamp, which is used as an
ultraviolet light source.It is generally known in technical fields, such as photochemical reactions, the curing
of paints and inks or the like, to use ultraviolet rays in a wavelength range of 250 to
400 nm. The term "paint" is also intended to cover the more general term
"lacquer".Normally a metallic vapour discharge lamp is used as such an ultraviolet radiation
source. For a more optimized use with respect to the above-described purposes, use
is made of a metallic vapour discharge lamp in which is encapsulated iron, which
has a plurality of line spectra in a wavelength range of 350 to 400 nm.However, if such a metallic vapour discharge lamp remains in operation for a long
time, due to the adhesion of the iron to the inner wall of the arc tube a thin film is
formed. The problem then arises that the quantity of iron contributing to the 
luminescing action decreases, that simultaneously the thin film prevents the passage
of the ultraviolet rays and consequently the intensity of the ultraviolet rays is significantly
reduced.In order to solve the above problem a measure is performed, in which e.g. at least
one of the metals lead, tin, thallium, cadmium, magnesium, bismuth or the like is
selected or metal halide is added and in which simultaneously the arc tube temperature
is regulated to 550 to 800°C. As is known, this measure prevents the formation
of the thin iron film over a long period of time.However, if the arc tube temperature is below 550°C, the encapsulated metal halide
condenses in a low temperature part within the arc tube and as a result a desired
emission cannot be obtained.However, if the arc tube temperature rises above 800°C, it is not possible to
adequately perform a halogen cycle within the arc tube, which leads to an adhesion
of the thin film of the metals, particularly iron, within the arc tube. It is therefore
necessary to keep the arc tube temperature constant in a range 550 to 800°C.Such a metallic vapour discharge lamp has been conventionally used in such a way
that it is operated with an input power of equal to or lower than 160 W/cm lighting
length and is simultaneously cooled by the exhausting or blowing out of air, as
shown in Fig. 2. A lamp of this type is disclosed in EP-A-0 444 591.However, of late, there has been a need for a stronger intensity or output of the
ultraviolet rays. In order to cover this requirement it is necessary to operate the
lamp with an input path of greater than 160 W/cm
