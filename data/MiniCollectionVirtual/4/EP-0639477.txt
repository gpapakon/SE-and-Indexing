<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an actuator 
assembly for vehicle seats as defined in the preamble of claim 1. 
Such seats are generally known in the state of the art. For adjusting the position of a vehicle seat in 
relation to the floor, actuator assemblies interposed 
between the seat portion of the seat and the vehicle 
floor are used for adjusting the seat horizontally and 
vertically. With known actuator assemblies, the seat is 
normally adjusted horizontally by means of a device 
comprising a pair of first guides fitted to the floor, 
and a pair of first slides moved along the first guides 
by a powered rack and pinion drive. In most cases, the 
powered drive comprises a pair of racks, each connected 
integral with a respective first guide, and a pair of 
pinions, each meshing with a respective rack and fitted 
to a respective end portion of a powered shaft connected 
to the first slides transversely in relation to the 
first guides. For vertically adjusting the seat, known actuator 
assemblies comprise a ramp device in turn comprising a  
 
pair of second slides supporting the seat frame, defined 
at the bottom by respective inclined edges, and each 
fitted in sliding manner to the inclined top edge of a 
respective first slide. Relative movement of the first 
and second slides is normally achieved by means of two 
screw-nut screw devices, each fitted to a respective 
second slide and operated by a respective electric 
motor. Though relatively straightforward to produce, ramp 
devices of the aforementioned type are less than 
satisfactory from the operating standpoint, by virtue of 
vertical adjustment of the seat also resulting 
automatically in an undesired change in its longitudinal 
position. Known actuator assemblies of the above type are 
also relatively expensive to produce on account of the 
rack and pinion drives, the racks and pinions of which, 
as is known, must be made of steel and subsequently 
fitted to the main body of the actuator, which is 
normally made of light material, preferably aluminium. Moreover, known actuator assemblies provide for an 
extremely limited amount of vertical adjustment; and, by 
virtue of normally being fitted in projecting manner, 
the screws of the screw-nut screw devices may oscillate 
during actual adjustment, thus resulting in jamming and 
impaired operation of the assembly as a whole. Finally, a further consequence of the screws being 
fitted in projecting manner is that, when the seat is  
 
positioned with the second slides in the limit stop 
posi
