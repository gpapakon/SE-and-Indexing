<ABSTRACT>
A subcomponent (48) for a subassembly (10) of a 
module of a longitudinal midbody for a double-walled vessel 

hull is fabricated by welding an edge (38,42) of a rib (26,34) 
to an intermediate location on a face of a hull plate 

(14,18). A plurality of such subcomponents (48) are 
alternately arranged and positioned in a fixture so as to 

dispose a free longitudinal edge (24,32) of a rib plate 
(26,34) in juxtaposition with adjoining longitudinal edges 

(20,20,28,28) of two outer hull plates (18), or with 
adjoining longitudinal edges of two inner hull plates (14). 

At each of these sites, the three adjoining edges are 
welded together at (22,30), thereby fabricating 

subcomponents into subassemblies (10). By preference, the 
hull plates are flat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vessel hull 
structure and a method of making such a structure. The U.S. patent of Cuneo et al., US-A-5,085,161, 
issued February 4, 1992, discloses and 
claims a method and apparatus for fabricating hull 
modules for the longitudinal midbody of a double-walled 
vessel, and for serially interconnecting 
those modules to provide a midbody, to which 
prefabricated bow and stern modules are added to 
constitute the vessel hull. Improvements in the 
method and resulting vessel hull constructions are 
disclosed in the U.S. patent of Goldbach et al, US-A-5,090,351, 
issued February 25, 1992. In the methods and constructions as 
disclosed in these prior patents, the fundamental 
fabricated subcomponent is two inner hull 
longitudinal plates arranged edge-to-edge so as to 
have a first set of two adjoining longitudinal 
edges, two outer hull longitudinal plates arranged 
edge-to-edge so as to have a second set of two 
adjoining longitudinal edges, and a longitudinal rib 
plate arranged generally perpendicularly to the 
inner and outer hull plates, with one longitudinal 
edge thereof juxtaposed with and forming part of the 
first set of adjoining edges, and the opposite 
longitudinal edge thereof juxtaposed with and 
forming part of the second set of adjoining edges. 
The first set of three plate edges is welded 
together to form a first T-joint and the second set 
of three plate edges is welded together to form a 
second T-joint. The resulting fabricated 
subcomponent is H-shaped and made up of five plates 
and two welds. In practice, according to the 
methods disclosed as preferred in the two prior 
patents, a subassembly which is more complex than  
 
the fundamental subcomponent is fabricated in upended 
orientation in a fixture in which more than 
five plates are simultaneously welded at more than 
two joints so as to simultaneously create and 
serially interconnect a plurality of such 
subcomponents. In these prior art constructions, 
the plates forming the inner and outer hull walls 
are disclosed as being convexly curved, and the hull 
wall interconnecting rib plates are disclosed as 
being flat, although possibly being provided with 
lightening holes and welded-on kick-plate 
stiffeners. An earlier U.S. patent to Tornay, US-A-4,638,754, 
issued January 27, 1987 discloses a 
double-walled vessel hull construction, also having 
curved hull plates and flat rib plates, but in which 
the longitudinal edges of the rib plates are welded 
to the hull plates at locations
