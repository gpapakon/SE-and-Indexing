<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to therapeutic compositions for 
use in the treatment of skin lesions and in particular dermal 

ulcers, wounds and burns. A second aspect relates to the 
preparation of said compositions and a further aspect relates 

to the use of medicinal herbs in the treatment of skin 
lesions. The invention provides a composition comprising from 

0.1 to 5 % by weight of a flavonoid glycoside or free sugar 
thereof and from 1 to 5 % by weight of a gelling agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
A first aspect of the present invention relates to therapeutic 
compositions for use in the treatment of skin lesions and in 
particular dermal ulcers, wounds and burns. A second aspect 
relates to the preparation of said compositions and a further 
aspect relates to the use of medicinal herbs in the treatment 
of skin lesions. There are many known medicinal products based on plant 
extracts. These products tend to be simple aqueous alcohol or 
oil based extractions from the plants themselves. A problem 
with the treatment of skin lesions with such products is that 
it is difficult and inconvenient to maintain contact between 
the extract and the wound due to the product form. In 
addition known treatments are extractions from large numbers 
of plants which may not all be therapeutic to chronic wounds 
such as dermal ulcers. An additional disadvantage is that 
aqueous extracts are liable to contamination by bacteria and 
thus have a very short useful life. In RO 93177 there is disclosed a solution for treatment of leg 
ulcers consisting of an aqueous alcohol extract obtained from 
Calendula officinalis L., root of Symphytum officinale L. and 
stem with root of Echinacea purpurea. The solution may be 
applied by poultice. The disadvantages of this type of 
treatment are that the sterility of the solution cannot be 
guaranteed due to potential bacterial contamination during use 
and treatment of wounds by poultice is inconvenient for both 
patient and carer due to non-adherence of the poultice to the 
wound. We have now found that skin lesions can be therapeutically 
treated using compositions comprising flavanoid glycosides or 
free sugars of flavonoid glycosides and gelling agents.  Accordingly the invention provides a therapeutic composition 
for use in the topical treatment of skin lesions comprising: 
from 0.1 to 5 % by weight of flavonoid glycosides or free 
sugars thereof
 
and
 
from 1 to 5 % by weight of a gelling agent. In particular the invention provides a therapeutic composition 
in gel-form for use in the topical treatment of skin lesions 
comprising:
 
from 0.1 to 5 % by weight of flavonoid glycosides or free 
sugars thereof
 
and
 
from 2 to 10 % by weight of a gelling agent. In a preferred embodiment the flavonoid glycoside is for 
example a glycoside of a flavonol or a flavone for example a 
glycoside of quercetin as found in extracts of Calendula 
officinalis L. Accordingly the invention provides a 
composition for the treatment of skin lesions comprising an 
aqueous extract of
