<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use in combination of specific antibodies,
or antigen binding fragments thereof with immunosuppressive agents. In particular,
such combination may be used in preventing or treating transplant rejection, graft
versus host disease, and other immunological conditions arising from the recognition
of specific antigens as foreign.Monoclonal antibodies have proven to be powerful tools in immunological
research. In general, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using impure antigens
as immunogens, provided that there is available a screening assay which
distinguishes antibodies directed against the antigen of interest from antibodies
directed against other antigens present in the immunogenic composition. When the
antigen of interest is a cell surface molecule, it is desirable to use cells or membrane
fractions 
containing the molecule of interest as immunogens in
order to preserve the conformational constraints
provided by a membrane environment.Immunizing mice with whole cells usually yields
a strong immune response which generates antibodies
to a large number of different molecules. This
broad immune response precludes the use of the
immunogen cells in subsequent screening for specific
antibody production by hybridoma clones derived from
the mouse spleen or lymphocyte cells.Furthermore, when the antigen of interest is
expressed at low density, it is likely that the
frequency of mouse B cells specific for the antigen
will be relatively low. This low frequency
necessitates the screening of large numbers of
hybridoma clones to identify a clone which produces
antibodies directed against the antigen of interest.syngeneic murine fibroblasts expressing human
cell surface antigens have been used to immunize
mice for specific antibody production (DiSanto et
al., 1991). When injected into the appropriate
mouse strain, the background antigen proteins
present on the fibroblasts should not be
immunogenic, so that the immune response should be
focused on the xenogeneic recombinant protein.
However, this approach requires the construction of
specific recombinant cells for each species or
strain in which antibody production is desired.Current strategies for the prevention of graft
rejection after transplantation are based on the use
of broad acting immunosuppressive agents such as
cyclosporin A (CsA), FK506 and corticosteroids. 
These drugs must often be taken over long periods of
time and therefore increase the risk of serious
infections, nephrotoxicity, and cancer. In
addition, not all

Use in combination of:

(a) a monoclonal antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof, said
antibody or fragment capable of specifically binding to B7 antigens on the surface of

an antigen-presenting cell (APC), and
(b) an immunosuppressive agent;

in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating conditions susceptible to inducing T cell anergy, wherein said
antibody or fragment and said immunosuppressive agent are used in an amount that

is effective to induce a T cell anergy by the combination that is greater than the sum
of the T cell anergy induced by the same amount of each of the components alone.
Use according to claim 1 in the manufacture of a medicament for
preventing transplant rej ection in a patient.
Use according to claim 1 in the manufacture of a medicament for
preventing or treating graft versus host disease (GVHD) in patient.
Use according to claim 1 in the manufacture of a medicament for
preventing or treating rheumatoid arthritis in a patient.
Use according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein the molecule that binds to
the B7 antigen is a monoclonal anti-B7 antibody.
Use according to claim 5, wherein the monoclonal antibody is a
humanised monoclonal antibody.
Use according to claim 5, wherein the monoclonal antibody is Mab
B7-24 (produced by the hybridoma cell line having ATCC Accession No: HB

11341). 
Use according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein the molecule that binds to
the B7 antigen is a fragment of an anti-B7 antibody that retains the antigen-binding

function of said antibody.
Use according to claim 8 wherein said antigen binding fragment has a
humanised component.
Use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the
medicament includes an immunosuppressive agent selected from cyclosporin A,

FK506, rapamycin and corticosteroids.
Monoclonal antibody B7-24 (produced by the hybridoma cell line
having ATCC Accession No. HB 11341).
