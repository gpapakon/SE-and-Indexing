<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid-containing 
type vibration isolating apparatus which is mounted to a 
vehicle such as an automobile or to general industrial 
machines so as to absorb and damp vibrations, according to the 
preamble of claim 1. A liquid-containing type vibration isolating apparatus, 
which can effectively absorb vibrations of different 
frequencies in accordance with respective vibrations, has 
been proposed. As shown in Figs. 17 and 18, a rubber main body 126 is 
disposed between an inner cylinder 112 and an outer cylinder 
114 in a liquid-containing type vibration isolating 
apparatus 110. A liquid chamber is formed within the rubber 
main body 126. In the liquid chamber, a pressure-receiving liquid 
chamber 130, a second sub-liquid chamber 150 and a first 
sub-liquid chamber 146 are defined by a partitioning wall 
member 134 and a second diaphragm 144 so as to be disposed 
in layers in a radial direction. The pressure-receiving  
 
liquid chamber 130 is communicated with the first 
sub-liquid chamber 146 via a first restricting passage. The 
pressure-receiving liquid chamber 130 is also communicated 
with the second sub-liquid chamber 150 via a second 
restricting passage 120. The sectional area of the second 
restricting passage 120 is larger than that of the first 
restricting passage, and the length of the second 
restricting passage 120 is smaller than that of the first 
restricting passage. The second diaphragm 144 forms a 
partitioning wall between the first sub-liquid chamber 146 
and the second sub-liquid chamber 150, and serves to expand 
and contract the second sub-liquid chamber 150. A thin 
first diaphragm 124 for expanding and contracting the first 
sub-liquid chamber 146 forms a portion of a partitioning 
wall of the first sub-liquid chamber 146. When, for example, shake vibration having a low 
frequency and large amplitude (e.g., vibration having a 
frequency of about 5 to 20 Hz and an amplitude of about 
± 0.5 to ± 1.0mm) is inputted to the liquid-containing type 
vibration isolating apparatus 110, the filled liquid flows 
between the pressure-receiving liquid chamber 130 and the 
first sub-liquid chamber 146 via the first restricting 
passage. Liquid-column resonance of the liquid is generated 
in the first restricting passage, and a damping force (loss 
factor: tan δ ) is generated in the liquid-containing type  
 
vibration isolating apparatus 110. Further, when, for example, idle vibration having a 
relatively high frequency and small amplitude (e.g., 
vibr
