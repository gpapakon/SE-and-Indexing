<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to proportional control
valves for controlling fluid pressure in a closed volume load.Proportional control valves can be actuated by
proportional solenoids to regulate back pressure from remote
devices. For example, U.S.-A-5,123,718,
discloses a solenoid actuated valve for
controlling a flow of fluid under pressure to a brake
cylinder. The flow of fluid is maintained until back
pressure from the brake cylinder reaches a desired
proportional relationship with an increased force exerted by
the solenoid. Back pressure is reduced by exhausting fluid
flowing from the brake cylinder until the back pressure
returns to the desired proportional relationship with a
decreased solenoid force.However, fluid flows between the proportional
valves and remote devices are accompanied by friction, which
causes a pressure drop between the source and the destination
of the fluid flow. Accordingly, pressure changes in remote
devices such as brake cylinders or other closed volume loads
tend to lag behind the changes in back pressure regulated by
proportional control valves. This can cause instability in
the operation of the valves.While charging, for example, proportional control
valves can momentarily close off the supply of pressurized 
fluid to the remote devices before the remote devices
have reached the desired pressure level. Upon closing
the supply, static pressure within the valves approaches
the prior average dynamic pressure of the valves and
remote devices, which is below the desired pressure level
and can cause the valves to momentarily reopen. This
sequence can be repeated many times until the desired
pressure increase in the remote devices is reached.Similar instability problems can be caused by a
pressure difference between the proportional control
valves and the remote devices while discharging. The
valves can momentarily close off the exhaust of
pressurized fluid from the remote devices before the
pressure in the remote devices has reduced to a desired
level. A static pressure increase in the valves up to
the prior average dynamic pressure of the valves and the
remote devices can cause the valves to momentarily reopen
to continue to exhaust more of the pressurized fluid from
the remote devices. Although the desired pressure level
is eventually reached while either charging or
discharging, the additional openings and closings of the
valves, which are required to reach the desired pressure
level, can cause accelerated wear, noise, pressure
fluctuations, and a decreased response time.An
