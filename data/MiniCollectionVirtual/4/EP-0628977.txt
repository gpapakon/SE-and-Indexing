<ABSTRACT>
In order to make it possible for a plurality of individual switch poles (1, 2, 3) of a multipolar circuit breaker to switch as synchronously as possible, a tie rod (7, 8) is provided which transmits a mechanical release pulse to the release devices (9, 9a, 10, 11) of the individual poles (1, 2, 3). Drive levers (13, 27, 28) to convert the movement into a release movement are articulated on the tie rod (7, 8). The tie rod (7, 8) is driven suddenly by a shaft (19), by means of release arms (20, 23) and levers (17, 17a) which are mounted in a fixed position.

Multipole, in particular three-pole, electric 
circuit breaker, in which each pole (1, 2, 3) has a 

driving device (4, 5, 6) for closing and opening, 
having a drivable rod (7, 8) for simultaneously 

actuating mechanical tripping mechanisms (9, 9a, 10, 
10a, 11, 11a) at the driving devices (4, 5, 6) of two 

or more poles (1, 2, 3), characterised in that the 
drivable rod is realised by two pull rods (7, 8), which 

can be actuated independently of each other in the 
axial direction and the first of which effects the 

tripping of the closing operation and the second 
effects the tripping of the opening operation of the 

poles (1, 2, 3). 
Multipole circuit breaker according to claim 
1, characterised in that there is articulated at each 

of the pull rods (7, 8) a respective first lever arm 
(16, 16a) of a respective two-armed, stationarily 

mounted lever (17, 17a), the second lever arm (18, 18a) 
of which can be moved out of its position of rest by a 

tripping arm (20, 23) fastened to a drivable stationary 
shaft (19). 
Multipole circuit breaker according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that there is articulated at the 

pull rods (7, 8), in the region of each pole (1, 2, 3), 
a first arm (12) of a two-armed driven lever (13), the 

second arm (14) of which actuates a tripping tappet 
(15) of the respective pole (1, 2, 3), which tripping 

tappet is movable at right angles to the direction of 
movement of the pull rod (7, 8). 
Multipole circuit breaker according to claim 
2, characterised in that in the case of each of the 

levers (17, 17a), the first lever arm (16, 16a) and the 
second lever arm (18, 18a) are constructed so as to be 

pivotable in a limited manner with respect to each 
other, in such a way that in the case of excursion of  

 
the respective second lever arm (18, 18a) beyond the 

limit of free pivotability, the respective first lever 
arm (16, 16a) is entrained. 
Multipole circuit breaker according to claim 2 
or 4, characterised in that the respective second lever 

arm (18, 18a) in the position of rest is swung out by a 
spring element (21) with respect to the respective 

first lever arm (16, 16a) up to the limit of free 
pivotability. 
Multipole circuit breaker according to one of 
the claims 2 to 5, characterised in that there is 

securely connected to each first lever arm (16, 16a) a 
limit-stop body (22, 22a) which limits the pivotability 

of the respective second lever arm (18, 18a) with 
respect to the respective first lever arm (16, 16a). 
Multipole circuit breaker according to claims 
2 to 6, characterised in that the lever arms (16, 16a; 

18, 18a) and the limit-stop bodies (22, 22a) are 
arranged in such a way that when the tripping arm (20, 

23) is pivoted in each direction of rotation of the 
shaft (19), in each case only one of the second lever 

arms (18, 18a) entrains the first lever arm (16, 16a) 
allocated to it. 
Multipole circuit breaker according to claims 
2 to 7, characterised in that there are provided two 

tripping arms (20, 23) which are fastened to the shaft 
(19) in such a way that in the event of a rotation of 

the shaft (19) about a fixed angle, each of the two 
second lever arms (18, 18a) is actuated by one of the 

two tripping arms (20, 23).
