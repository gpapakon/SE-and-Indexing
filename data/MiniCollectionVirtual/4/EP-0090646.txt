TITLE : DETERGENT BAR PROCESSING
Field of the Invention
 This invention relates to the processing of soap feedstocks to provide a soap bar having reduced grittiness.


Background to the Invention
 Soap bars are required to have a smooth feel to provide comfortable in-use properties. However some ingredients in soap material can lead to grittiness during washing. A common feature of most soap processing lines is the use at the final plodder stage of scrap soap from the stamped bars. Soap from this source will have a lower water content than the soap feed material and will thus be harder. The presence of the scrap soap can lead to grittiness in the bar. Grittiness may also develop when a super fatting agent is added to soap after the final dryer stage.


 The present invention utilises processing conditions to reduce grittiness by subjecting the soap feedstock to considerable working in an efficient manner.


General description
 Certain formulations leading to grittiness in the product bar when processed by standard methods will be less  gritty when subjected to processing in accordance with this invention.


 The present invention uses a device of the cavity transfer mixer class to work the soap base. These devices comprise two closely spaced mutually displaceable surfaces each having a pattern of cavities which overlap during movement of surfaces so that material moved between the surfaces traces a path through cavities alternately in each surface so that the bulk of the material passes through the shear zone in the material generated by displacement of the surfaces.


 Cavity transfer mixers are normally prepared with a cylindrical geometry and in the preferred devices for this process the cavities are arranged to give constantly available but changing pathways through the device during mutual movement of the two surfaces. The devices having a cylindrical geometry will comprise a stator within which is journalled a rotor; the opposing faces of the stator and rotor carry the cavities through which the material passes during its passage through annular the device.


 The device may also have a planar geometry in which opposed plane surfaces having patterns of cavities would be moved mutually, for example by rotation of one plane, so that material introduced between the surfaces at the point of rotation would move outwards and travel alternately between cavities on each surface.


 Another form of cylindrical geometry maintains the inner cylinder stationary while rotating the outer cylinder. The central

<CLAIMS>
What we claim is:



1. A process of reducing the grittiness in a soapcontaining detergent material wherein the material is subjected to working by passing the material between two closely spaced mutually displaceable surfaces each having a pattern of cavities which overlap during movement of the surfaces so that the material moved between the surfaces traces a path through cavities alternately in each surface, whereby the bulk of the material passes through the shear zone in the material generated by displacement of the surfaces.

 


2. A process according to Claim 1 wherein the two surfaces have cylindrical geometry.



3. A process according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein thermal control is applied to at least one surface.



4. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the cavities in at least one surface are elongate with their long dimension normal to the flow of material.



5. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the temperature of the soap-containing formulation during processing is in the range from about   30 C    to about   55"C.   



6. A process according to Claim 5 wherein the temperature is below about   4O0C.
