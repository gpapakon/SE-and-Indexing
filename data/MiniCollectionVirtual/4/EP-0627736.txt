<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetooptical recording/reproducing 
apparatus, a beam spot is formed on a recording medium 

by radiating a laser beam from an optical head to the 
recording medium. In a magnetic field modulation 

recording, a bias magnetic field is applied from a 
first bias magnetic field generation device onto a very 

small region where the beam spot is formed. In an 
optical modulation recording, an bias magnetic field is 

applied from a second bias magnetic field generation 
device to the very small region. The first bias 

magnetic field generation device is adapted to be 
evacuated from a position above the very small region 

by an evacuating mechanism. The second bias magnetic 
field generation device is adapted to be moved to the 

position above the very small region to be mechanically 
interlocked with the evacuating mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptical
recording/reproducing apparatus provided with first and
second bias magnetic field generation devices, wherein
a laser beam is irradiated to a recording medium from
an optical head movable with respect to the recording
medium to form a light spot on the recording medium,
and the first and second bias magnetic field generation
devices are properly used according to plural
modulation schemes to effect recording of information
by applying a magnetic field to a very small region on
which the light spot is formed.As one conventional magnetooptical disk apparatus
for performing magnetooptical recording/reproduction,
an apparatus, which performs recording based on a
so-called optical modulation method, i.e., applies a
predetermined magnetic field from a bias magnetic field
generation device to a recording region of a
magnetooptical recording medium, and radiates a laser
beam modulated according to recording information from 
an optical head to the recording region, is known. As
the other apparatus, an apparatus, which performs
recording based on a magnetic field modulation method,
i.e., radiates a constant laser beam from an optical
head to a recording region, and applies a magnetic
field modulated according to recording information from
a bias magnetic field generation device to the
recording region, is known. Thus, a demand has arisen
for a magnetooptical disk apparatus which has
compatibility allowing recording/reproduction of
information on both magnetooptical recording media of
these different methods.For this purpose, conventionally, as shown in
Figs. 1 to 4, a magnetooptical disk apparatus which has
a structure using two different bias magnetic field
generation devices has been proposed. In this case, a
bias magnetic field generation device A used for
recording in the magnetic field modulation method is
arranged as a first bias magnetic field generation
device, and a bias magnetic field generation device B
used for recording in the optical modulation method is
arranged as a second bias magnetic field generation
device.As is well known, in the bias magnetic field
generation device A, a floating slider 2 which mounts a
magnetic head as a bias magnetic field generation unit
is supported by a support member 2b via a support 
spring 2a as a load beam, and the support member 2b is
pivotally supported, via a pivot shaft 12, on a
carriage 10 which carries an optical system. A torsion
coil spring (not shown) is arranged around the pivot
shaft 12 so as to bias the
