<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in
a camera adapted to use a film cartridge having a
movable light shield door.Conventionally, in most methods of loading a film
cartridge in a camera, a rear cover 2 as shown in
Figs. 17A and 17B is opened backward from the camera,
and a cartridge 17 is loaded in a cartridge chamber 18
which appears at the open portion. In this method,
however, a camera user can see the interior of the
camera from the open portion. This makes an
inexperienced user anxious. Additionally, since the
method of loading a cartridge slightly changes for each
camera, loading becomes complicated, or the hand
position on the camera or the cartridge must be changed
many times. For this reason, cartridge loading can fail
or the camera user feels inconvenienced when loading
cartridges. The present invention is concerned with alleviating
this problem.European patent specification No EP-A-0488499
discloses an x-ray film cassette transport mechanism
which enables an x-ray film cassette to be loaded through
a window, gripped, and then withdrawn inwardly to a
properly centred exposure position. After use the
cassette is ejected so that it projects partially from
the window by a distance which is automatically
determined in accordance with the size of the cassette.US Patent Specification No US-A-5049914 discloses a
photographic camera which has a chamber for receiving a
film cassette capable of automatically thrusting a non-protruding
film leader to the exterior of the cassette
shell in response to unwinding rotation of a film spool
within the shell. Additionally an ejecting member can
pop the film cassette at least part way out of the
chamber end first when a cover door for the chamber is
manually opened.US Patent Specification No US-A-5159365 discloses a
camera capable of automatic film rewinding into a 
cartridge which is mounted in a chamber within the camera
and also of automatically moving the cartridge into and
out of the chamber.It will be seen that neither of the above references
provides the solution to the problem of ensuring correct
loading and unloading of a film cartridge as set out in
the main claim of the present application.In accordance with the present invention there is
provided a camera as set out in claim 1.Other aspects of the present invention will become
apparent from the following description of the
preferred embodiments.Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing a camera
according to the first embodiment of the present
invention;Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the

<CLAIMS>
A camera adapted to use an image recording medium
cartridge having a cover for allowing an image recording

medium to exit from or be drawn into the image recording
medium cartridge, the camera comprising:


a cartridge chamber (18);
a chamber cover for opening or closing the cartridge
chamber;
operation means (3,4,68) capable of automatically
opening/closing of the chamber cover and moving a

cartridge into and out of the chamber;
determination means (19,20) for determining
whether said operation means completes at least one of

said actions within a first predetermined time period; and
for determining

whether or not said camera has been left in the state in
which said operation means has completed said at least

one action for a second predetermined time period after
said first determination means has determined that said 

operation means has completed said at least one action
within the first predetermined time period, whereby if said

operation means has opened said chamber cover to
allow the either insertion of a cartridge into said cartridge

chamber or the withdrawal of a cartridge from said
cartridge chamber, and said first determination means

have determined that this action of opening the chamber cover has been completed and
that said second determination means has determined

respectively either that a cartridge has not been
inserted into or a cartridge has not been withdrawn from

the cartridge chamber within the predetermined time
period said operation means act automatically to close

the opened chamber cover.
A camera according to claim 1, wherein said
operation means include means (6) adapted on operation

either to move a cartridge inserted into the cartridge
chamber into an operative position within the cartridge

chamber or to move a cartridge mounted within the
cartridge chamber outwardly from the cartridge chamber. 
A camera according to claim 2, wherein said
operation means include switch means (5a, 5b, 10) for

detecting respectively when the chamber cover is fully
shut or fully open or if a cartridge is in its loaded

position within the chamber.
A camera according to any preceding claim, wherein
said determination means comprises means (S305:6b,

S306:5c, S803:5c) for disabling opening of the cover of
the cartridge when said determination means determines

that a loading operation of the cartridge by said
operation means is inappropriate.
