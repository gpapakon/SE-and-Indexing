<ABSTRACT>
The sequences of 5' ESTs derived from mRNAs encoding secreted proteins are disclosed. The 5' ESTs may be to obtain cDNAs and genomic DNAs corresponding to the 5' ESTs. The 5' ESTs may also be used in diganostic, forensic, gene therapy, and chromosome mapping procedures. Upstream regulatory sequences may also be obtained using the 5' ESTs. The 5' ESTs may also be used to design expression vectors and secretion vectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
 5' ESTs FOR SECRETED PROTEINS EXPRESSED IN TESTIS AND OTHER TISSUESBackground of the InventionThe estimated 50,000-100,000 genes scattered along the human chromosomes offer tremendous promise for the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. In addition, probes capable of specifically hybridizing to loci distributed throughout the human genome find applications in the construction of high resolution chromosome maps and in the identification of individuals.In the past, the characterization of even a single human gene was a painstaking process, requiring years of effort. Recent developments in the areas of cloning vectors, DNA sequencing, and computer technology have merged to greatly accelerate the rate at which human genes can be isolated, sequenced, mapped, and characterized. Cloning vectors such as yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are able to accept DNA inserts ranging from 300 to 1000 kilobases (kb) or 100-400 kb in length respectively, thereby facilitating the manipulation and ordering of DNA sequences distributed over great distances on the human chromosomes. Automated DNA sequencing machines permit the rapid sequencing of human genes. Bioinformatics software enables the comparison of nucleic acid and protein sequences, thereby assisting in the characterization of human gene products. Currently, two different approaches are being pursued for identifying and characterizing the genes distributed along the human genome. In one approach, large fragments of genomic DNA are isolated, cloned, and sequenced. Potential open reading frames in these genomic sequences are identified using bioinformatics software. However, this approach entails sequencing large stretches of human DNA which do not encode proteins in order to find the protein encoding sequences scattered throughout the genome. In addition to requiring extensive sequencing, the bioinformatics software may mischaracterize the genomic sequences obtained. Thus, the software may produce false positives in which non- coding DNA is mischaracterized as coding DNA or false negatives in which coding DNA is mislabeled as non-coding DNA. An alternative approach takes a more direct route to identifying and characterizing human genes. In this approach, complementary DNAs (cDNAs) are synthesized from 

isolated messenger RNAs (mRNAs) which encode human proteins. Using this approach, sequencing is only performed on DNA which is derived from protein coding portions of the genome. Often, only short
