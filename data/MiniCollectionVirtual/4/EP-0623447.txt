<ABSTRACT>
In backseal extruders containing multiple bores wherein passage of 
material 

between the bores is allowed by a longitudinal interconnecting opening 
(28) and the 

screws (7) in the bores have flow restricting means (18) delimiting 
higher (12) and lower (26) 

pressure sections, the pressure difference between these sections can 
be increased by 

restricting the width of the nip (36) between the bores, which defines 
the longitudinal opening, to no more than 0.38 of the bore diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an extruder, more specifically to a non-intermeshing,
co or
counter rotating twin screw extruder.In an apparatus for working a material, usually referred to as an extruder, the
extruder may be of the type wherein twin, co or counter rotating non-intermeshing
screws are disposed within a barrel bore. The extruder is generally divided into
sections or zones for the performance of different operations. For example, there is a
feed section wherein material fed into the extruder is conveyed into a second section
which may be a mixing section or a section wherein a reaction takes place.
Sectioning is generally achieved, especially in those instances which require zones of
differing pressures, by the placement of flow restriction means between the zones.
Many times, it is necessary to have the reaction section under a positive pressure in
order to promote the reaction of materials. Thereafter, the reacted materials are
passed to an area of lower pressure wherein undesirable liquids and volatiles are
released from the reaction mixture. The construction of conventional extruders is
such that between the barrel bores, wherein the screws are placed, there is a channel
or opening which is usually in the form of a longitudinal slot, formed by the absence
of a dividing wall between the bores, depicted as 4 in accompanying Fig 3.One way in which the pressure may be maintained in the reaction section is to have
a flow restriction means on each screw between the high pressure zone and a low
pressure zone. The material being treated will flow against this restriction means
thereby creating substantial back pressure. The magnitude of this back pressure
determines the pressure differential between the upstream high pressure zone and
the downstream low pressure zone. Unfortunately, because of the channel between
the barrel bores, there is considerable pressure leakage between the high pressure
zone and the low pressure zone. This leakage diminishes the capacity of the 
restrictions on the screws to maintain a pressure differential between the high and
low pressure zones.This pressure leakage results in the material in the high pressure zone being
at a pressure which is not as great as desired. In some reactions, conducted within a
high pressure zone, because of the pressure leakage from the high pressure zone to
the low pressure zone, raw material usage is greatly increased to obtain the amount
of product which would have been obtained if the pressure in the high pressure
zone could have been

Multi-bore extrusion apparatus wherein adjacent bores are inter-connected by
a longitudinal nip between the bores and wherein screws located within the bores

are provided with flow restricting means for delimiting upstream sections of
relatively high pressure from downstream sections of relatively low pressure,

characterised in that the dimensions of the nip, at least in a part of the length
coextensive with the flow restricting means, are such that the ratio of the width of

the nip to the bore diameter is from 0.1 to 0.38.
An apparatus for treating material fed therein and comprising a housing
having two congruent bores extending through said housing, an inlet extending

through said housing and into at least one of said congruent bores, a pair of non-intermeshing
parallel or tangential, co or counter rotating twin screws, each

disposed within one of said bores, means connected operably to said screws for
turning said screws, slid screws having flow restricting means disposed on each of

said screws, said bores having a nip region, said nip region being defined by the
ratio of the width between a pair of imaginary parallel lines, said lines being parallel

to a plane defined by the center lines of the bores, one of which imaginary lines
would touch the top of the nip and the other of which would touch the bottom of the

nip, divided by the bore diameter, said ratio being equal to or less than 0.38 and
being coextensive with at least a portion of the length of said flow restricting means,

and an outlet in said apparatus for discharging material fed to and worked in said
apparatus; the apparatus being such that a higher back pressure is created in the

section of the extruder immediately preceding the section of the extruder having the
nip ratio of from 0.1 to 0.38.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the ratio is from 0.1 to 0.25. 
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the flow restricting means

the reaction or mixing zone downstream of it.
An apparatus according to any preceding claim, having pressure adjusting
means which is independent of pressure and temperature conditions in the reaction

or mixing zone.
An apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the pressure adjusting means
may be actuated externally from the reaction or mixing zone.
An apparatus according to any preceding claim, also having means to bypass
the flow restricting means for the flow of material from the reaction zone to a zone of

lower pressure than the pressure in the reaction zone.
A process wherein material is treated in an extruder as claimed in any
preceding claim and optionally wherein the pressure in the reaction or mixing zone

is adjusted independently of the pressure in the reaction or mixing zone.
