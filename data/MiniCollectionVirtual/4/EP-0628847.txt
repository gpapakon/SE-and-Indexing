<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystalline
polymer film useful as a high function optical element, a
process for producing the same, and utilization thereof.A polymer film having a birefringence property is
anisotropic in refractive index and functions as an optical
element which controls the state of polarization. It has
various industrial uses, including a phase contrast film
for improving the image quality of a liquid crystal display,
a half-wave plate and a quarter-wave plate.Most of the conventional polymer films having a
birefringence property have been obtained by stretching
films such as polycarbonate films for example. However, a
limit has been encountered in improving their performance
because the means for controlling their physical properties
such as refractive index and birefringence is only a
stretching operation which is substantially a processing
technique. Particularly, as to controlling a three-dimensional
refractive index structure for which there has
been an increasing demand recently, a limit is encountered.On the other hand, an optical material using a liquid
crystalline polymer possesses great characteristics; for
example, it has a greater birefringence property than
that of stretched films, and it is possible to freely
control its optical properties such as refractive index or
birefringence because the orientation behavior of the
liquid crystalline polymer is rich in variety. 
Particularly, a liquid crystalline polymer which exhibits
twisted nematic orientation is a more useful material which
possesses a novel ability of rotating the direction of
polarization of light. This is because it is possible to effect a
molecular twisted orientation which cannot be obtained by a
stretched polymer film, and thus the said liquid
crystalline polymer is a very useful material.When such a liquid crystalline polymer is oriented on a
substrate, and in the case of a liquid crystal which
exhibits a nematic orientation property, there is obtained a
homogeneous orientation wherein the orienting direction
(hereinafter referred to as the "director") of liquid
crystalline molecules is approximately parallel to the
substrate or a homeotropic orientation wherein the director
is approximately perpendicular to the substarate. Further,
in the case of a liquid crystal which exhibits a chiral
nematic orientation property, there is obtained an
orientation having a spiral structure while making a
homogeneous orientation. Besides, the control of refractive
indices distribution and that of the spiral
