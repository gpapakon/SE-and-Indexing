<ABSTRACT>
An earth system comprises an outer case, in which the outer case (10) includes a rail (13) formed longitudinally along support plates (12) which are extended inward from both sides of the bottom of the outer case. The rail (13) has a grounded protrusion (14) protruding from the upper end thereof. The grounded protrusion strips off a painted film of an air-conditioner unit base to enable an air-conditioner unit to be electrically contacted with the outer case in a metal to metal arrangement, when the air conditioner unit is inserted into the outer case.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to an earth device for a window-type 
air conditioner, and more particularly, to an earth system 
with at least one grounded protrusion which is formed on both 
sides of the bottom surface of an outer case and which forces 
the outer case to be directly grounded to the bottom surface, 
when the air conditioner unit is inserted into the outer case. Air-conditioners generally cool room air, using a 
refrigerating cycle. The refrigerating cycle includes a 
compression type refrigerator. The refrigerant is compressed 
in the high temperature and the high pressure state by a 
compressor, being liquified in a condensing unit with the 
forced cooling of a blower, being decompressed passing through 
a capillary tube and then absorbs heat from room air while 
being gasified in an evaporator. At that time, room air intaken 
by the blower is passed through the evaporator to be cooled and 
then discharged indoors. These window-type air conditioners comprise an outer case 
10 in a box shape, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, and generally 
comprise a compartment having an evaporator, which is disposed 
at an indoor side; a compartment having a compressor and a 
condenser, which are disposed at an outdoor side; and a 
partition dividing the compartments, in which the outer case 
10 includes a front plate 20 formed on its front surface, on 
the surface of which an inlet portion 21 introducing room air 
thereinto and an outlet portion 22 discharging heat-exchanged  
 
air outward from indoors. On the other hand, as the general window type air-conditioner 
lowers room temperature by heat-exchanging 
refrigerant with room air at the evaporator, moisture contained 
in room air is condensed by the dewing phenomena. Especially, 
in the summer season of high humidity, moisture condensed by 
the evaporator is increased a lot, so the electrical insulating 
state becomes worse, and the current applied to the compressor 
leaks through an electric connection point. Further, the 
electrical devices of the air conditioner are shorted with the 
outer case to discharge the leakage current. In order to prevent this electric leakage, the 
conventional air conditioners have a separate grounded line or 
uses a different metal coupling member to keep the outer case 
and other parts of the air-conditioner grounded. The conventional earth device includes a coupling member. 
As shown in the "A" part of Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the 
earth device is constructed so that a coupling hole 11 is 
formed on the side walls of

<CLAIMS>
An earth system of a window-type air-conditioner 
comprising: 


an outer case (10) for enclosing an air-conditioner 
unit (29) to be received therein; 
a support plate (12) extending inward from both sides 
of the bottom of said outer case; 
at least one rail (13) extending longitudinally on 
said support plate (12), its section having a semicircle 

shape; and 
at least one grounded protrusion (14) formed on said 
rail (13) in the form of a pointed tip. 
The earth system of the window-type air-conditioner 
according to claim 1,
 
wherein said grounded protrusion (14) gets said air-conditioner 

unit (29) to be contacted with said outer case 
(10) by stripping off a paint film formed on the base 

surface of said air-conditioner unit (29), when said air-conditioner 
unit is mounted in said outer case (10) on said 

rail (13). 
The earth system for the window-type air-conditioner 
according to claim 1 or 2,
 
wherein a plurality of said grounded protrusions (14) are 

formed on said rail (13) at an interval.
