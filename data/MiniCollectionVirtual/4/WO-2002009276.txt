<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a RF signal amplifier unit receiving a first RF signal (RFin), and comprising means for amplifying (3, 4, 12, 15) said first RF signal to deliver a second amplified RF signal (RF1). Said signal (RF1) must be amplified by a predetermined nominal power (Pout) to be delivered at the unit output. The invention is characterised in that the unit comprises means for measuring (7) the power of the second amplified RF signal (RF1), means for coupling (5, 16) the amplified RF signal towards a first output (S1) of the unit, a control signal (Sc) generated by a central unit (8) for controlling the coupling means on the basis of a comparison between the power of the amplified RF signal and a nominal power value (Pout). The invention also concerns a RF transmitting device designed to be arranged at the focal point of RF signal focusing means comprising said amplifier unit and a RF signal transmitting terminal-antenna. The invention is applicable to moving satellite tracking.
