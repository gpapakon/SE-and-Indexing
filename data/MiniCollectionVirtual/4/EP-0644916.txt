<ABSTRACT>
A flegmatizer, which is an oligomer of styrene or of styrene and at least one comonomer, is admixed with an organic peroxide to reduce the heat- and/or shock-sensitivity of the peroxide. The resulting composition can be employed to polymerize olefinic monomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OLIGOMERS OF STYRENE AS FLEGMATIZERS FOR ORGANIC PEROXIDESThe present invention relates to the use of shock- and/or heat-sensitive organic peroxides as initiators for the polymerization of olefinic compounds.Many organic peroxides are known and used to initiate polymerization of monomers containing olefinic unsaturation. Many such peroxides are sensitive to shock and usually are handled only in diluted form. Generally, the addition of an appropriate diluent reduces the shock-sensitivity of the organic peroxide to the point where it can be safely handled. The problem of shock sensitivity of such peroxides has been recognized for many years. See, e.g. U.S. Patent 4,178,263, which discloses diluting the peroxide with an olefinically unsaturated monomer which does not homopolymerize. According to said patent, monomers which exhibit no tendency to homopolymerize are those monomers which in admixture with an organic polymerization-inducing peroxide do not polymerize to more than one percent conversion of monomer to polymer at 100 hours at 40Â°C when the organic peroxide and monomer are present in a one-to-one ratio by weight. Typical non-homopolymerizing monomers include: maleic anhydride, dimethyl maleate, diethyl maleate, citriconic anhydride, dimethyl citriconate, methyl citriconate, ethyl citriconate, fumaronitrile, methyl fumarate, dimethyl fumarate, ethyl fumarate, diethyl fumarate, cinnamonitrile, methyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate and stilbene. These monomers readily copolymerize with the basic monomer present, e.g. styrene.When diluted peroxide compositions are employed in the free-radical polymerization of olefinically unsaturated materials, the diluent material frequently has a deleterious effect on the resulting polymer; for example, in the polymerization of polystyrenes materials such as oils, hydrocarbon diluents and high molecular weight hydrocarbons are not readily removed from the polymer after polymerization and result in a reduction in the heat- distortion temperature. When polymers made with organic peroxides are used in food contact applications, the diluent used with the peroxide must be nontoxic. In many countries, approval by a government agency is required for use of the diluent in the polymer. In the case of styrenic polymers, the list of additives which meet the requirements for a good flegmatizer and which are also approved for food contact applications is very small. Examples of known flegmatizers include dioctyl phthalate, fatty acid esters, epoxidized soybean oil and mineral oil.
