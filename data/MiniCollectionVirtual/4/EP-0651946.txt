<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for controlling 
the composition of a gas mixture present in a space (2,3) by 

detecting the concentration of at least one component of the 
gas mixture and extracting from the space and subjecting to 

a treatment at least a portion of the gas mixture, wherein 
the concentration of the at least one component is detected 

in the portion of the gas mixture extracted from the space. 
The invention also relates to an apparatus for 
performing this method provided with means connected to the 

space over a supply duct (12,13) and a discharge duct (5,6) 
gas mixture extracted 

from the space, control means connected 

for signal generating to the gas mixture treatment 
means, and means connected to the supply duct for detecting 

the concentration of at least one component of the gas 
mixture, which concentration detecting means are connected 

for signal generating to the control means (18). 
The described method and apparatus enable performing 
of concentration measurements at a central location 

without the necessity of having to install separate sample 
ducts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for
controlling the composition of a gas mixture present in a
space by detecting the concentration of at least one
component of the gas mixture and extracting from the
space and subjecting to a treatment at least a part of
the gas mixture, the concentration of the at least one
component being detected in the part of the gas mixture
extracted from the space. Such a method is known from EP-A-0
315 309.In a conventional method, as disclosed e.g. in
EP-A-0 160 325, which is applied particularly for
controlling the atmosphere in cooling cells in which
fruit is stored, a periodic sample of the atmosphere in
the cooling cell was taken. This sample was analyzed and
the thus found composition of the atmosphere was compared
to a composition of the atmosphere desired for optimum
storage life of the fruit. When unacceptable variations
were determined between the detected and the desired
composition of the atmosphere in the cooling cell the
atmosphere was treated, for instance by connecting the
cooling cell to a so-called active carbon scrubber, with
which an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be removed
from the atmosphere, or with a nitrogen (N2) generator,
with which the oxygen (O2) content in the cooling cell
could be limited. Relatively oxygen-rich ambient air can
also be admitted by opening a valve in a wall of the
cooling cell. The above stated treatments of the
atmosphere in the cooling cell can also be performed
periodically, for instance under the control of a
computer program.A drawback to this conventional method was
that, in order to minimize the effect on the atmosphere
in the cooling cell resulting from taking the sample, the 
latter had to have a relatively small volume in relation
to the volume of the cooling cell. Use was therefore made
for taking the sample of thin sample ducts which ran from
the cooling cell to a central analysis and control
device. Since such a central analysis and control device
was relatively expensive and thus had to be used
simultaneously for the greatest possible number of
cooling cells, the sample ducts are comparatively long.
There was therefore a great risk of the sample duct
becoming blocked, for instance through freezing of the
gas sample present therein as a result of the low
temperatures prevailing in the vicinity of cooling cells.
Particularly in winter it hereby became difficult to
obtain a reliable picture of the state of the atmosphere
in a large number of cooling cells. In order to prevent
this blockage through freezing attempts

Method for controlling the composition of a
gas mixture present in a space (2, 3) by detecting the

concentration of at least one component of the gas
