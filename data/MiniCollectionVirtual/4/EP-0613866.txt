<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide an improved process for the 
production of a glass preform for an optical fiber which includes 

substantially no bubble therein and also have a substantially 
uniform shape, there is provided a process for the production of 

a glass preform which comprises at least silica for an optical 
fiber comprising producing a body comprising a rod on which fine 

glass particles are deposited preferably by the vapor phase 
reactions and heating the body to vitrify under a reduced 

atmosphere or a vacuumed atmosphere so that the glass preform 
is produced; in which process the heating comprises a first 

heating step of degassing the body at a first heating 
temperature, a second heating step of shrinking the body at a 

second heating temperature which is higher than the first 
heating temperature and which is lower than a third heating 

temperature, and a third heating step of vitrifying the shrunken 
body at the third temperature which corresponds to a 

vitrification temperature of the fine glass particles so as to 
produce the glass preform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a glass preform for an optical fiber, and in
particular a glass preform comprising at least silica from which
an optical fiber is directly drawn without any additional
treatment for the preform or an intermediate glass preform from
which an optical fiber is drawn after some additional treatment
for the preform.A glass preform comprising at least silica for an
optical fiber is produced by heating, at an elevated temperature,
a body comprising a rod on which fine glass particles are
deposited by the vapor phase reactions (which deposition process
is known in the field as, for example, the outside chemical vapor
deposition process and the vapor phase axial deposition (VAD)
process) in an electrical furnace so that the glass particle
deposited body is vitrified (namely consolidated). Such a
vitrification process has been conventionally carried out by
heating the body at an atmospheric pressure under an atmosphere
filled with helium gas or an inert gas containing a small amount
of a halogen gas. In such a process, a gas contained in the fine
glass particles of the body remains confined within the body
when the body is vitrified, which causes a problem that the
vitrified body (namely the vitrified preform) includes bubbles 
therein.In order to solve such a problem, Japanese Patent
Kokai Publication No. 63-21025 discloses a process for the
vitrification of the glass preform in which the preform is heated
under a vacuumed atmosphere or a reduced atmosphere. In this
process, since the atmosphere is reduced or vacuumed, the body
comprising the fine particles are degassed so that it is expected
that no bubble is left in the vitrified body.Fig. 2 schematically shows a conventional apparatus
for the production of the glass preform for the optical fiber. The
apparatus comprises a vacuum vessel (10) in which a muffle tube
(2) surrounding a fine particle deposited body (1) and a heating
member (8) positioned outside the muffle tube (2) are placed and
a thermal insulation (a heat shield) (9) is located between the
heating element 8 and the wall of the vessel (10). The vessel (10)
is further equipped with an evacuation port to which a vacuum
pump (7) is connected through a vacuum line (6) so that the
atmosphere inside the vessel can be vacuumed or reduced. The
glass particle deposited body (1) inserted in the muffle tube (2)
is vitrified there by heating it with the heating member (8).However, it has been found that the bubbles remain in
the preform when

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of a silica-based glass
preform for an optical fiber comprising:


(i) depositing fine glass particles on a rod to form a
body (1),
(ii) heating the body under reduced pressure at a first
temperature to degas it,
(iii) heating the degassed body under reduced pressure at
a second temperature which is higher than the first

temperature to shrink it, and
(iv) heating the shrunken body under reduced pressure at
a third temperature which is higher than the second

temperature and which causes vitrification of the fine glass
particles to produce the glass preform;

   characterised in that the heating step (iii)
for shrinking the body

is carried
out in such a way that different portions of the body in its

longitudinal direction are heated to different second
temperatures which are controllable independently of each

other, the body being oriented to have a lower and an upper
portion, the temperature of the lower portion being greater

than the temperature of the upper portion.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the first
temperature is in the range 1000-1300°C, and the heating step

(ii) is carried out
while lowering the pressure

until the pressure reaches 10 Pa or less.
A process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the
heating step (iii)

for shrinking the body
comprises heating the body at a temperature

in the range 1320-1480°C at a pressure of 10 Pa or less for

10-120 minutes. 
A process according to any preceding Claim, wherein the
heating step (iv)

for vitrifying the fine glass particles
comprises heating the body at a temperature

in the range 1490-1600°C at a pressure of 10 Pa or less for 1-60
minutes.
A process according to any preceding Claim, wherein the
rod is a glass rod having an at least double waveguide

structure whose periphery has a lower refractive index than
its core.
