<ABSTRACT>
A method for demetallating crystalline molecular sieve 
materials comprises removing transition metal in the sieve framework 

with a transition metal complexing agent having a pH above 3; and 
thereafter annealing, for example by solution phase, or thermal, 

annealing.

<DESCRIPTION>
High silica zeolitic materials are important catalysts by
virtue of high stability and controlled acidity. Numerous methods
have been developed to dealuminate aluminosilicate zeolites and
convert them into high silica analogs, see, for example, Kerr (Amer.
Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. #121, p. 219 (1973)), McDaniel and Maher (Amer.
Chem. Soc. Monograph #171, p. 285 (1976)), and Scherzer (Amer. Chem.
Soc. Symp. Ser. #248, p. 157 (1984)). More recently, much interest
has focused on dealumination using ammonium silicon hexafluoride, see
for example, Breck and Skeels (Proc. 6th. Int'l. Zeolite Conf., p. 87,
(1984) Butterworks Press) and nonaqueous solvents with SiCl4, [see
Rees and Lee (P.C.T. W088/01254 (1988))]. All of these methods suffer
from a tendency to non-selective Al3+ removal, with selective surface
enrichment with silicon or aluminum. Furthermore, they are difficult
to control at specific Al3+ removal levels, and in some cases
significantly damage the pore structure of the zeolite.Zeolites and molecular sieves comprise framework structures
in which an oxygen framework is crosslinked by tetrahedrally or
octahedrally (or mixtures of both) coordinated highly charged cations.
Typically those cations may be mixtures of IVSi4+, IVAl3+, IVp5+,
(IVSi4++VISn4+),
(IVSi4++VITi4+),
(IVSi4++VIZr4+), and numerous other
combinations. Framework charge deficiency, created by various
cationic substitutions into these framework cation positions, require
the presence of charge balancing cations. These may occupy specific
"nonframework" "exchange" sites within the open space of the framework
and sometimes be very mobile within this space. These exchangeable
cations can be readily replaced or removed by numerous methods known
in the art and are not the target of this invention. The "framework"
cations however are locked into the oxygen network and are difficult
to remove or replace. Numerous methods have been developed to control
this "framework" composition in molecular sieve materials, either by
direct synthesis or by "secondary synthesis," particularly
dealumination methods referred to above. In our US-A-4 961 836 we disclose the treatment of a transition metal-containing
alumino-silicate with an acid, viz. H4EDTA or a mineral acid, for example
hydrochloric acid, to extract transition metal.US-A-5 098 687 refers to the treatment of a crystalline aluminosilicate
with a fluoro salt of titanium to replace framework aluminium with titanium.US-A-4 605 809 describes the purification of natural zeolites
