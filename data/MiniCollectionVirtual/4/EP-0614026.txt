<ABSTRACT>
There is proposed a friction lining comprising non-organically bound friction elements which consist of a cold-pressed friction composition of     from 30 to 50 % by volume of iron powder   from 5 to 45 % by volume of carbon   from 20 to 35 % by volume of copper or copper alloy   from 0 to 10 % by volume of friction supporters and from 0 to 10 % by volume of solid lubricants.

<CLAIMS>
Friction lining comprising a steel support plate on 
which pillar-shaped friction elements of non-organically 

bonded friction material based on metal 
powders are positioned, optionally with the use of 

resilient elements, characterised in that the 
friction elements comprise an unsintered friction 

composition of 

30 to 50 vol.% Iron powder 
5 to 45 vol.% Carbon particles 
20 to 35 vol.% Copper and/or Copper alloy, 
preferably chips 
0 to 10 vol.% Friction promoters and 
0 to 10 vol.% Solid lubricant 
 
and at least the side surface of the friction 

elements is enveloped with copper or a copper alloy. 
Friction lining as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the friction composition contains copper 

alloys with zinc, tin and/or phosphorous. 
Friction lining as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the friction composition 

contains high carbon-containing chromium, chromium 
carbide and/or ferrochrome as the friction promoter. 
Friction lining as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the friction composition 

contains molybdenum disulphide as the lubricant. 
Method of manufacturing a friction lining by  
 

fastening pillar-shaped friction elements of non-organically 
bonded friction material based on metal 

powder to a steel support plate, characterised in 
that the friction composition comprising 


30 to 50 vol.% Iron 
5 to 45 vol.% Carbon 
20 to 35 vol.% Copper and/or Copper compounds 
0 to 10 vol.% Friction promoter and 
0 to 10 vol.% Solid lubricant 
 
is introduced in a manner known per se into a mould 

and pressed without heating at a pressure of 25 to 
50 kN/cmÂ² into friction elements which, optionally 

after heating up to a temperature below the 
sintering temperature, are connected to the support 

plate in the conventional manner. 
Method as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that 
the friction composition is introduced into 

cylindrical blanks of copper-containing material and 
subsequently pressed.
