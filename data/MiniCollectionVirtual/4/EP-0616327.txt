<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a device for recording information in a servo-track 
(2) of a record carrier (1) of a rewritable type. Pieces of information, for 

example, in the form of pieces of music (tracks) are recorded in the servo-track (2) in 
accordance with first recording instructions. According to these first recording 

instructions information patterns representing a piece of information are allowed to be 
rewritten with information patterns for a new piece of information. At a later instant the 

information in the servo-track is rearranged. During that operation information recorded 
in accordance with the first recording instructions is read out and rewritten in 

accordance with second recording instructions. These second recording instructions 
prescribe that the pieces of information intended to be read out be recorded in the 

servo-track as a continuous series of information patterns and that the information 
patterns representing a piece of information be uninterrupted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for recording information in a servo-track of a
record of a rewritable type, which device comprises recording means for recording
pieces of information in the form of information patterns in the servo-track of the record
carrier in accordance with first recording instructions, according to which first
recording instructions information patterns representing a piece of information are
allowed to be overwritten with information patterns for a new piece of information,
reading means for reading the information recorded in accordance with the first
recording instructions and rewriting means for rewriting the read-out information in
accordance with second recording instructions, the second recording instructions
prescribing that the pieces of information read out be recorded
in the servo-track as a continuous series of information patterns and the information
patterns representing a piece of information be uninterrupted, and including control
means for controlling the reading means and the recording means for the reading and
rewriting of the information.Such a device is known, for example, from US-A 4970608. With this
prior-art device it is possible to record pieces of information in the form of still video
in concentric tracks. With the prior-art device it is possible to rewrite previously
recorded tracks with new tracks. EP-A-0275972 describes a similar device in which
information such as music is recorded in a continuous track. In this device a new track
to be recorded will generally not be as long as the track that is rewritten. In the case
where the newly recorded track is shorter than the track that is rewritten, the end of the
newly recorded track will not link up with the beginning of the next track. Between the
end of the newly recorded track and the beginning of the next track there will still be a
part of the originally recorded track.The servo-track portions which contain these remainders are indicated in a
table of contents present on the record carrier. When the record carrier is played back,
the servo-track portions containing remainders are localized and skipped on the basis of
the table of contents, so that these remainders do not become audible when played back. The device according to US-A-4970608 comprises reading means for
reading the information recorded in accordance with the first recording instructions and
rewriting means for rewriting the read-out information in accordance with second
recording instructions, the second recording instructions
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device for recording information in a servo-track (2) of a record carrier (1) of a
rewritable type, which device comprises recording means (24,29) for recording pieces

of information in the form of information patterns in the servo-track of the record carrier in
accordance with first recording instructions, according to which first recording

instructions information patterns representing a piece of information are allowed to be
overwritten with information patterns for a new piece of information, reading means (35,

50) for reading the information recorded in accordance with the first recording
instructions and rewriting means ((28, 29, 34) for rewriting the read-out information in

accordance with second recording instructions, the second recording instructions
prescribing that the pieces of information read out be recorded

in the servo-track as a continuous series of information patterns and the information
patterns representing a piece of information be uninterrupted, and including control

means (26) for controlling the reading means and the recording means for the reading
and rewriting of the information, characterized in that the device comprises control

means (26) for controlling the velocity with which the servo-track is scanned during the
recording, reading and rewriting operations with a first, second and third scanning

velocity respectively and that the second and third scanning velocities exceed the first
scanning velocity. 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the device comprises a
buffer memory (34) coupled to the reading means for storing the read-out information, the

buffer memory also being coupled to the recording means for supplying the information
stored in the memory.
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the control means (26) are

arranged for interrupting and resuming the reading and/or rewriting processes in
dependence on the occupancy level of the buffer memory.
Device as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the device
comprises command feeding means (80) for feeding the commands indicating the order in

which the information is to be recorded in accordance with the second recording
instructions, and in that the control means (26) are coupled to the command feeding means

for receiving the fed commands, and in that the control means are arranged for effecting
the re-writing in the order indicated by the fed commands. 
Device as claimed in one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that
the reading means comprise a read head (24) for scanning the information to be read out and

the rewriting means comprise a write head (50) for scanning the servo-track for the purpose
of rewriting, the scanning operation of the read head and the scanning operation of the

write head being independently controllable.
