<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a metal powder pigment comprising polished atomised pigment particles of aluminum or an aluminum alloy which are facetted and have a median particle size of from 1 to 300 (my)m and an aspect ratio of from 5/1 to 1.1/1. The polished atomised metal powder particles have an increased reflectivity with respect to unpolished atomised metal powder particles of at least 10 %. The pigment of the invention can be used to provide novel visual effects in single and multilayer coating systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal powder 
pigment, its preparation and its use in coating systems to 
provide novel visual effects. Metal powder may be prepared in an atomiser (see for 
example US-A-4705560). Conventional atomised powder 
produced in this way consists essentially of fairly uniform 
particles having a median particle size (D50) of 1 to 300 
µm, usually 3 to 75 µm, more usually 5 to 40 µm and an 
aspect ratio, that is ratio of largest dimension to 
smallest dimension, of about 1.5 to 5/1. By modification 
of the atomisation process it is possible to reduce the 
aspect ratio towards unity, i.e. towards a perfect sphere. 
In practice, such so called spherical atomised powders are 
of similar diameters to the foregoing, but have aspect 
ratios of at most 1.5:1, more usually less than 1.3:1. By 
virtue of their sphericity, the sphere being the 
geometrical shape having the lowest ratio of surface area 
to volume, atomised metal powder particles have poor 
covering power and are dull and relatively non-reflective. Metal flake pigment may be prepared from atomised 
metal powder by either wet or dry ball milling. In wet 
ball milling (see for example US-A-1569484 and US-A-3901688) 
metal powder is ball milled with an organic liquid 
such as mineral spirits and a small amount of a lubricant 
such as oleic acid or stearic acid, and the resulting  
 
flakes are separated, for example by wet sieving, to 
provide the desired particle size distribution and brought 
to a paste-like consistency of, typically, 55 to 80% by 
weight. In dry ball milling (see for example 
US-A-4115107) metal powder is ball milled in the absence of 
liquid but inert gas is passed through the mill at such a 
rate that flake is removed as it is formed. In these milling processes flakes are formed 
substantially instantaneously whenever an essentially 
spherical powder particle is trapped between milling media, 
usually polished metal balls which have a very high mass 
relative to that of the trapped particle. Thus even after 
only a short milling time, a sample removed from the mill 
base in a wet milling process will contain flakes in 
addition to the starting powder particles (which have not 
been trapped between the milling media). The metal flakes produced in this way have a 
significantly different geometry to that of the starting, 
essentially spherical, powder particles. Commercially 
available metal flakes typically have a second largest 
dimension, measured at right angles to the largest 
dimension, of less
