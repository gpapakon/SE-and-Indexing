<ABSTRACT>
A nipple is disclosed which has a head (3) formed 
with a drive slot (6) comprising at least two working 

surfaces (6a,b) set parallel at a distance from each other 
and defining respective shoulders, and respective helical 

ramp surfaces (8a,b) extending from the top of one of said 
working surfaces toward the bottom of the other, adjacent 

working surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved spoke nipple 
for connecting a spoke to the rim of a spoked wheel, which 
nipple has a head, located at an axial end and formed with a 
drive slot for engagement by a driver tool whereby said 
nipple can be rotated about its axis relative to the wheel 
spoke. Nipples of the above-mentioned kind are 
conventionally employed in the fabrication of spoked wheels 
for securing the wheel spokes to the wheel rim in an 
adjustable fashion, as by threaded engagement of the nipples 
with threadways on the free ends of corresponding wheel 
spokes. To facilitate the wheel assembly and adjustment 
operations, the head of each nipple is slotted to receive a 
driver tool, whereby the nipple can be driven rotatively. 
Such a driver tool may comprise, for example, a flat or a 
box screwdriver tool, an open or a socket wrench tool, as 
implied by the specific configuration of the slot. The wheel assembly operation is usually carried 
out in three steps. During a first step, the wheel is 
pre-assembled, with the nipples just started along their 
respective spokes. For this first step, air-operated drivers 
are often used. During a second step, which may be carried 
out to advantage using adjustable torque electric screw 
drivers, the wheel is roughly trued up. During the third, 
and last, step a precision truing operation is performed 
with the possible use of robot systems having hands which 
grasp the nipples at a nipple shank portion which is 
polygonal in plan view. The initial steps, specifically the wheel 
pre-assembly step, may be fairly critical. This criticalness 
results from the use of automatic drivers, particularly 
air-operated ones, which can attain very high rotational  
 
speeds, on the order of up to 7,500-10,000 rpm. Such 
rotational speeds of the tool make it difficult to correctly 
engage the tool with the drive slot in the nipple head. 
Especially where the slot is a plain one and the tool has a 
flat bit operated at high rpm, the above engagement may only 
occur after some idle rotations of the driver tool, thereby 
causing the latter to wear prematurely and perhaps damage 
the nipple head surface. Additionally to marring the 
appearance of the nipple, its damaged surface may defeat the 
protection afforded by any (nickel or zinc) plating 
provided. It is the object of this invention to provide a 
nipple which can be screwed in/out with automatic drivers, 
while limiting, if not eliminating, the drawbacks with which 
the aforementioned prior art is beset. This

<CLAIMS>
An improved spoke nipple (1) for connecting a 
spoke (8) to the rim (11) of a spoked wheel, which nipple 

comprises a head (3), located at an axial end and formed 
with a drive slot (6) for engagement by a driver tool (7), 

whereby said nipple (1) can be rotated about its axis 
relative to the wheel spoke (8), characterized in that said 

slot (6) has at least two working surfaces (6a,b) lying 
parallel and spaced apart from each other and defining 

respective shoulders for said driver tool (7) and respective 
ramp surfaces (8a,b) which extend from the top (9a,b) of one 

of said working surfaces toward the bottom of the other, 
adjacent working surface. 
A nipple according to Claim 1, wherein said ramp 
surfaces (8a,b) have a helical pattern. 
A nipple according to either Claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said drive slot (6) comprises a cut extending diametrically 

across said head and delimited between said working 
surfaces, and said ramp surfaces (8a,b) extend from the free 

edge of the cut facing one of said working surfaces toward 
the top of the other, adjacent working surface. 
A nipple according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein said head is formed with a threaded axial 

bore (4) for engagement by the corresponding spoke (8), and 
said working and ramp surfaces (6a,b; 8a,b) extend 

crown-like around said bore (4). 
A nipple according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein said ramp surfaces (8a,b) slope down from 

the top toward the bottom of the working surfaces in the 
screwing direction of the nipple onto a spoke.
