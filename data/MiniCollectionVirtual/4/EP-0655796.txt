<ABSTRACT>
A linear actuator (1) for actuating the feed 
device (204) of a parabolic antenna in relation to the 

reflector (202), to permit reception from variously 
located satellites. The actuator (1) comprises a 

cylindrical casing (3) housing an electric motor (5) for 
powering a screw (9) housed in a tubular body (7) 

extending axially from one end of the casing (3). The 
screw (9) is fitted with a slide (98) housed in the 

tubular body (7) and presenting a recirculating-ball nut 
screw (114) connected to the screw (9); and the slide 

(98) is also connected to a support (120) projecting 
from the tubular body (7) and supporting the feed device 

(204).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a linear 
actuator, particularly for actuating the feed device of 
a parabolic antenna. Parabolic antennas are known comprising a 
parabolic reflector, and a feed device located at the 
focus of the reflector and which receives 
electromagnetic radiation reflected by it. Parabolic antennas of this type are conveniently 
used for receiving electromagnetic signals transmitted 
by satellite, particularly television satellites. Some parabolic antennas also feature an actuating 
device for moving the parabolic reflector by varying the 
tilt of the reflector axis in relation to the 
horizontal, for receiving signals from variously located 
satellites. Known actuating devices however are extremely 
complex (and expensive) and require at least two 
distinct connecting cables: one for carrying the signal 
received by the feed device; and the other for carrying 
the actuating device supply and control signals.  Other parabolic antennas for receiving signals 
from different satellites feature a horizontally-fixed 
reflector; the feed device is movable by a linear 
actuator in relation to the reflector; and one cable is 
provided for carrying both the signal received by the 
feed device and the actuator supply and control signals. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a highly efficient, highly reliable linear 
actuator for actuating the feed device of a parabolic 
antenna. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a linear actuator as described in Claim 1. A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention 
will be described by way of example with reference to 
the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a partially sectioned side view of 
an actuator in accordance with the teachings of the 
present invention; Figure 2 shows a partially sectioned bottom plan 
view of the Figure 1 actuator; Figures 3 and 4 show larger-scale views of a 
detail of the Figure 1 actuator; Figure 5 shows a section along line V-V in Figure 
4; Figure 6 shows a section along line VI-VI in 
Figure 1; Figure 7 shows an example application of the 
actuator according to the present invention. Number 1 in Figures 1 and 2 indicates a linear 
actuator, in particular for actuating the feed device of 
a parabolic antenna. Actuator 1 comprises a tubular casing 3 housing a 
d.c. electric motor 5; and an elongated tubular body 7 
extending axially from one end of tubular casing 3 and 
housing a screw 9 movable angularly by motor 5. More specifically, tubular casing 3 comprises a 
cy
