<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the electrolytic treatment of spent batteries in order to recover the value-enhanceable elements. The process, in which the spent batteries are subjected to a mechanical treatment, to a magnetic sorting and to flotation, is characterised in that the dense inorganic sludges resulting from the flotation are subjected to a lixiviation (leaching) by sulphuric acid, the pH of the solution obtained after lixiviation is adjusted to a value of between 2.5 and 4 in order to precipitate and separate mercury sulphate and oxide, the solution obtained after removal of the mercury compounds is reacidified by addition of sulphuric acid and is then subjected to an electrolysis during which zinc is deposited on the cathode and manganese oxide forms at the anode.

A method for processing used electric batteries in 
order to recover the re-usable elements, in which the 

used batteries are subjected to mechanical treatment in 
order to dislodge the casings from the
 batteries, then 
to magnetic sorting in order to separate the ferrous 

metals from the non-ferrous metals Hg, Mn, Zn, Cd and 
Ni, then the fraction rid of the ferrous metals is 

subjected to flotation in order to eliminate the inert 
substances and the thick mineral sludges obtained after 

the flotation are subjected to leaching by sulphuric 
acid, characterised in that: 


the pH of the solution obtained after leaching is 
adjusted to a value of between 2.5 and 4 in order to 

precipitate the mercury sulphate and oxide, and the 
precipitate obtained is separated; 
the solution obtained after elimination of the 
mercury compounds is reacidified by the addition of 

sulphuric acid, then it is subjected to electrolysis 
during which the zinc is deposited on the cathode and 

the manganese oxide is formed at the anode. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that an aluminium cathode is used for the electrolysis. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that an anode of alloyed lead, graphite or anodised 

titanium is used for the electrolysis. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the processing temperature is less than 100°C. 
A method according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the processing temperature is between 40°C and 

95°C.  
 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that a reducing agent is added to the electrolytic 

bath. 
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the reducing agent is selected from boric acid, 

formic acid and formaldehyde. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the solution rich in acid obtained at the end of 

the electrolysis is used for the leaching. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the batteries are subjected to cold crushing under 

a current of dry air. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the fraction rid of the ferrous metals is 

subjected to a second crushing operation, before the 
flotation. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the solution obtained after leaching is subjected 

to cementation in order to extract the copper, before 
adjusting the pH for the extraction of the mercury 

compounds. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the solution obtained after the electrolysis is 

subjected to additional selective electrolysis in order 
to extract the cadmium and/or the nickel. 
A method according to Claim 12, characterised in 
that the selective electrolysis is effected at a fixed 

potential of between 1.5 V and 5 V with pneumatic 
agitation, at a pH between 4 and 5.5, the temperature 

being kept between 25°C and 50°C.  
 
A method according to Claim 12, characterised in 
that an alloyed lead anode is used for the selective 

electrolysis. 
A method according to Claim 12, characterised in 
that a plate iron cathode is used for the selective

A method according to Claim 12, characterised in 
that the selective electrolysis is a static 

electrolysis. 
A method according to Claim 12, characterised in 
that the selective electrolysis is an electrolysis in 

circulation on a branched loop. 
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the manganese oxide obtained after the 

electrolysis is treated with sulphuric acid, pyrogallol 
or formic acid is added to the solution of sulphates 

obtained and the solution obtained is subjected to a 
second electrolysis in a diaphragm cell. 
A method according to Claim 18, characterised in 
that a stellite cathode and a graphite, lead or 

titanium anode are used for the second electrolysis.
