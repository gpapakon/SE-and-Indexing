<ABSTRACT>
A nonwoven cloth (6) of ultrafine fibers having high bulkiness, heat retaining property and tensile strength. A thermoplastic 
polymer component A is provided. A thermoplastic polymer component (B) non-compatible with respect to the component A 

and having a melting point higher than that of the component A by 30째-180 째C is provided. A fiber web is formed by accumulating 
long composite fibers obtained by a bicomponent melt spinning method using the components A, B with at least the component 

A exposed on the outer surfaces of the fibers. The component A only is then softened or melted by applying heat to predetermined 
regions of the fiber web in the direction of the thickness thereof, so that the long composite fibers are fused together. A 

fiber fleece (5) having predetermined regions spaced in a dotted or latticed state is obtained. This fiber fleece (5) is subjected to a 
rubbing step. The long composite fibers existing in the non-fused region (12) are divided so that the fiber dividing rate reaches a 

predetermined level, to produce fibers A consisting of the component A alone and fibers B consisting of the component B alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonwoven
fabric made of fine denier filaments suitable for a
padding in clothing, a material for medical or
sanitary use, etc., and to a production method
thereof. The nonwoven fabric is highly bulky, with
high heat insulation and high tensile strength.Nonwoven fabrics have been heretofore popularly
employed in such uses as clothing materials,
industrial materials, geotextile materials,
construction materials, agricultural materials,
horticultural materials, living materials, medical
materials or sanitary materials. Among all of the
nonwoven fabrics, a nonwoven fabric made of continuous
filaments has advantages of high tensile strength and
high productivity, as compared with nonwoven fabric
made of staple fibers. The production of the nonwoven
fabric with high thermal insulation, while maintaining
the above advantages may specifically require the
filament denier as fine as possible. As for the nonwoven fafric made of fine denier
filaments, various method have been well known
including, for example, a method in which bicomponent
conjugate filaments of the both component incompatible
each other are splitted by a needle punching, another
method in which the said bicomponent conjugate
filaments are subject to a treatment with a solvent
thereby swelling and dissolving one component while
separating another component therefrom, or a method in
which bicomponent conjugate filaments are splitted by
applying a water jet needling thereto. These known
proposals, however, have several problems to be
solved.That is, the needle punching tends to be
effective only when the weight (per square meter) of
the nonwoven fabric is in the range of 400 to 800
g/m2. This is because if the number of filaments per
unit area is small, sufficient entanglements are not
achieved by the needle punching. Accordingly, the
obtained nonwoven fabric tends to be high with its
weight and, moreover, remarkably poor with its
softness.Then, the method of swelling and dissolving one
component by the treatment with the solvent while
separating another component therefrom was disclosed 
in the Japanese Patent Publications (examined)
No.24699/1969, No.30629/1977, No. 41316/1987, and
No.47579/1989. These claimed methods, however, are
very uneconomical in view of dissolving all or any
part of one component, and there are further more
problems in the aspect of a treatment stage such as a
complicated process due to the dissolution, removal,
and recovery of the solvent, in the aspect of an
arrangement of non-pollution

A nonwoven fabric made of fine denier
filaments derived from bicomponent conjugate filaments

which are bicomposed of a thermoplastic polymer
component "A", and a thermoplastic polymer component

"B" insoluble in the said component "A" and having a
melting point higher than that of the said component

"A" by 30 to 180째C, and in which at least said
component "A" is exposed on a surface of the

bicomponent conjugate filaments,

the said nonwoven fabric characterized by; having
heat bonded areas formed by heat bonding the said

bicomponent conjugate filaments mutually to one
another, which are provided with a certain space

between one heat bonded area and another by softening
or melting only the said component "A" of the said

bicomponent conjugate filaments,
having non bonded area without heat bonding the
said bicomponent conjugate filaments which are

consisted of filaments "A" exclusively composed of the
component "A" manifested by splitting said bicomponent

conjugate filaments, filaments "B" exclusively composed
of the component "B" manifested by splitting said

bicomponent conjugate filaments, and non-splitted
bicomponent conjugate filaments which are not splitted, 
and said filaments "A", said filaments "B" and
said nonsplitted bicomponent conjugate filaments are

mixedly contained without substantial three-dimensional
entanglements thereamong.
A nonwoven fabric made of fine denier
filaments in accordance with claim 1, wherein fineness

of said filaments A is 0.05 to 2.0 denier, and that of
said filaments B is 0.02 to 0.8 denier.
A method for producing a nonwoven fabric made
of fine denier filaments comprising the steps of:


forming a web by accumulating bicomponent
conjugate filaments, each of which is bicomposed of a

thermoplastic polymer component "A" and a thermoplastic
polymer component "B" insoluble in the said component

"A" and having a melting point higher than that of the
component "A" by 30 to 180째C, and in which at least the

said component "A" is exposed on a surface of the
bicomponent conjugate filament;

bonded areas) is no less than 70%.
