<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making through-connections in multilayer printed circuit boards, whose inner layer copper surfaces (3) are oxidised before being pressed together. This disadvantage of the high cost of reduction agents is overcome by the invention in that the pressed-together and drilled printed circuit boards are subjected to a reduction process before through-connections are made. As well as saving reduction agents, this also achieves an interruption-free surface of the through-connections. When through-connections are being made in the pressed-together and drilled printed circuit boards, there are frequently interruptions in the copper coating on the copper cut-out points in the holes. This disadvantage is avoided in the case of the normal process by reduction of the entire oxide layer on the inner layer before pressing together which, however, means a major cost for reduction agents.
