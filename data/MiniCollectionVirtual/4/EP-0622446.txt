<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides processes for the refining of 
oil and fat by which phospholipids in the oil and fat to be 

treated can be decomposed and removed efficiently. 
Particularly, it provides a process for the refining 
of oil and fat which comprises reacting, in an emulsion, the 

oil and fat with an enzyme having an activity to decompose 
glycerol-fatty acid ester bonds in glycerophospholipids 

(e.g., pancreas-derived phospholipase Aâ‚‚); and another 
process in which the enzyme-treated oil and fat is washed 

with water or an acidic aqueous solution. Preferably, the 
acidic aqueous solution to be used in the washing step is a 

solution of at least one acid selected from the group 
consisting of citric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid and 

salts thereof. Also, it is preferred that the emulsified 
condition is formed using 30 weight parts or more of water 

per 100 weight parts of the oil and fat. 
Since oil and fat can be purified without employing 
the conventional alkali refining step, generation of washing 

waste water and industrial waste can be reduced. In 
addition, the recovery yield of oil is improved because loss 

of neutral oil and fat due to their inclusion in these wastes 
does not occur in the inventive process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the refining
of oil and fat. More particularly, it relates to a process
for the refining of oil and fat, in which an enzyme is
allowed to react with the oil and fat in an emulsified
condition, thereby effecting efficient decomposition and,
thus, removal of phospholipids from the oil and fat to be
treated.Oils obtained from the usual oil and fat production
processes by compressing oil-bearing materials or by
extracting oil from the materials and removing the extraction
solvent (hereinafter, referred to as "crude oil") contain
impurities such as polar lipids mainly composed of
phospholipids, as well as fatty acids, pigments, odor
components and the like. Thus, it is necessary to remove
these impurities by a refining process. The refining process
requires a degumming step and an alkali refining step. In
the degumming step, hydration of phospholipids and the like
is effected by adding hot water to the crude oil and gum
materials are removed by centrifugation. In the alkali
refining step free fatty acids in the degummed oil are
neutralized with caustic soda and removed by centrifugation. Thereafter, refining of oil and fat is completed via
a bleaching step in which chlorophyll and the like pigments
are removed by allowing them to be adsorbed by activated
clay, activated carbon or the like and a deodorization step
in which odor components are removed by vacuum distillation.
In the case of the production of salad oil, a dewaxing step
is optionally employed in order to crystallize and remove
solid fats, waxes and the like which are apt to be
solidified.However, in the alkali refining step in which free
fatty acids are neutralized with caustic soda and then
removed by centrifugation, residual phospholipids are also
removed, but the step generates so-called "soap stocks" which
contain a large quantity of accompanying oil. Though a
portion of the soap stocks is used as production material for
fatty acids, they are treated mostly as industrial waste.In addition, in the subsequent neutralization step,
the processed oil is washed with hot water in order to remove
soap dissolved in the oil, thus generating a large quantity
of oil-containing alkaline waste water which must also be
treated.These alkali refining and neutralization steps cause
a great loss in the oil and fat yield.Thus, since the conventional oil and fat refining
process requires complex and time-consuming steps, great
concern has been directed toward the development of a 
refining process which can be operated more
