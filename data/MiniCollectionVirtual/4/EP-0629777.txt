<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a fuel injection system for an 
internal combustion engine having improved fuel metering 

characteristics by means of minumizing any pressure pulses and 
fluctuations using a high pressure fuel pump having a plurality 

of positive displacement pumping devices, that are operating 
such that their delivery cycles overlap and such that the 

instantaneous speed of the pumping devices during their 
deliveries strokes is constant, so at to minumize pressure 

variations in the system and to avoid the necessity of having 
the pump being driven in a sychronized relationship to the 

engine output shaft. This permits the use of a variable speed 
drive so that the pump can be driven at speed ratios depending 

upon engine demand and/or eliminate the necessity for positive 
drives to maintain sychronization.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel injection system of an internal combustion
engine comprising a fuel pump having at least two positive displacement
pumping devices, each movable in a cycle through a suction stroke and a
delivery stroke and a drive means for said pumping devices, said pumping
devices being operated such that the delivery stroke of said pumping devices
overlap each other, so that a sum of an instantaneous speed of the pumping
devices during the delivery stroke is constant, said pumping devices comprise
reciprocating plunger pumps having pump plungers operated by at least one
eccentric cam lobe of a pump drive shaft which forms a common drive means
for all pumping devices.Such a device is disclosed in EP-A-0 304 741. However,
although this in-line injection pump for fuel injection systems
is capable to pump high-pressure fuel at a constant rate of
flow without the need of an internal accumulator, this system
is not capable to adapt the fuel output to different load
conditions at the same speed of engine.Moreover document US-A-4 295 798 discloses a fluid pump which
is adapted to be driven in two speed ranges. However, this
pump is not driven by a continuously variable speed drive and
further is not capable to adapt the fuel output to different
load conditions at the same speed of engine.It has been well known that the fuel efficiency, performance
and emission control of an engine can be improved by use of
a fuel injection system. With such systems, fuel is
delivered under pressure to the engine through a fuel
injector which generally includes an injection valve that is
opened and closed so as to permit the fuel to be sprayed to
the engine. The fuel may be introduced either to the
induction system or directly into the combustion chambers of
the engine. Although this type of arrangement has a number of
advantages, there are areas where performance can still
further be improved. For example, it is normally the
practice to supply the fuel to the fuel injectors by means
of a high pressure pump. Such pumps are conventionally
reciprocating type pumps and in some instances, there may be
employed one pump for each fuel injector. The pumps may,
however, include a common driving element. The disadvantage
with this type of construction is that the output pressure
of the fuel from the reciprocating pump varies during the
pumping cycle. Basically, the pressure variations are
approximately equal to the variations in speed of the
pumping piston. These pressure variations can, therefore,
cause problems in
