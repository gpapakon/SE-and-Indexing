<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
apparatus for detecting failures of a longitudinal acceleration 
sensor for detecting longitudinal acceleration of a 
motor vehicle and more particularly, to an apparatus which 
is capable of detecting not only a small-gain failure that 
output of the longitudinal acceleration sensor is smaller 
than actual acceleration of the motor vehicle but a large-gain 
failure that output of the longitudinal acceleration 
sensor is larger than actual acceleration of the motor 
vehicle and is properly used for an antiskid control 
system. Conventionally, in order to improve control 
accuracy of an antiskid control system, it has been proposed 
to utilize signals from a longitudinal acceleration 
sensor for detecting longitudinal acceleration of a motor 
vehicle. The antiskid control system performs control on 
the premise that the longitudinal acceleration sensor is 
normal. Therefore, in case failures of the longitudinal 
acceleration sensor happen such that output value of the 
longitudinal acceleration sensor is smaller or larger than 
actual acceleration or deceleration of the motor vehicle, 
performance of the antiskid control system in which the 
signals from the longitudinal acceleration sensor are used 
as control data deteriorates greatly.  
 For example, in an antiskid control system in 
which the signals from the longitudinal acceleration sensor 
are used for performing estimated calculation of vehicle 
body speed, brake fluid pressure is reduced, increased or 
held on the basis of wheel speed which is calculated from 
vehicle body speed estimated from signals outputted by the 
longitudinal acceleration sensor and output of wheel speed 
sensors. Therefore, if vehicle body speed calculated from 
output of the longitudinal acceleration sensor is different 
from actual vehicle body speed, such problems arise that 
braking distance increases due to insufficient brake fluid 
pressure or wheels are locked due to excessive brake fluid 
pressure. In order to solve these problems, an apparatus 
for detecting failures of the longitudinal acceleration 
sensor has been proposed so far. For example, Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2-284968 (1990) proposes 
an apparatus which, if it is found that output of a longitudinal 
acceleration sensor has a value indicative of 
acceleration or deceleration of a motor vehicle when the 
motor vehicle is running at a constant speed, judges the 
longitudinal acceleration sensor to be defective so as to 
perform fail-safe
