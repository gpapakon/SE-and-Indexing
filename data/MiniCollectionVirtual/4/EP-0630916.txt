<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ethylene/pentene-1 
copolymer composition comprising an ethylene/pentene-1 
copolymer (I) and at least one compound (II) selected from the 
group consisting of a phenolic stabilizer, an organic phosphite 
stabilizer, a thioether stabilizer, a hindered amine stabilizer 
and a metal salt of a higher aliphatic acid, which is excellent 
in heat stability in the molding stage, long-term heat 
stability and weatherability. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), that is a 
copolymer of ethylene and α-olefin, shows higher impact  
 
strength when molded into a film, as compared with 
conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) obtained by 
the high pressure process, so that the linear low-density 
polyethylene has been broadly used as a film-forming 
material. A film obtained from an ethylene/butene-1 copolymer 
(i.e., an example of the linear low-density polyethylenes) 
is excellent in tear properties because of its adequate 
tear strength, but is somewhat low in the impact strength. A film obtained from a copolymer of ethylene and α-olefin 
having 6 or more carbon atoms (i.e, other example of 
the linear low-density polyethylene) is excellent in the 
impact strength, but has such a problem that the film 
cannot be easily torn because of too high tear strength. 
In other words, the film obtained from such copolymer is 
bad in the tear properties. Accordingly, eagerly desired are ethylene/α-olefin 
copolymers which can provide films of high impact strength 
and excellent tear properties. For the purpose of more 
improving the impact strength of films, a method of using 
α-olefin having larger number of carbon atoms has been 
tried. However, the method sometimes causes such problems 
that the blocking resistance of the resulting film is much 
lowered and the transparency of the film is markedly 
reduced when the film is subjected a heat treatment. 
Especially in the case of a lamination film, after the  
 
film-forming procedure, the obtained film is generally 
subjected to an aging procedure at approx. 40 °C to enhance 
the dimensional stability, but in this aging procedure, the 
film sometimes turns white so that the transparency is 
reduced. EP-A-0 141 597 discloses a copolymer of ethylene with at least 
one C4-C20 α-olefin having a melt flow rate of 0.01 to 200 g/10 
min, a density of 0.850 to 0.930 g/cm3, and an α-olefin content 
of 0.5 to 40 mol%. This document does not disclose or teach an 
ethylene/pentene-1 copolymer which fulfills requisites (E) and
