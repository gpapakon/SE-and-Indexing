Process for the evaluation of the adhesive 
character of vegetable fibrous materials such as 

cottons, characterised in that: 

a sample (3) of the fibrous material is 
prepared in such a manner that it has a wide 

surface in relation to its weight, ie. of the 
order of 100cm
2
 for a weight of between 0.5 and 5g; 
the sample which is thus spread is 
applied to a metallic plate, for example of 

aluminium (4, 15, 21), by means of a pressing and 
heating member for several seconds; 
a cold pressure is subsequently applied 
to the same sample on the same plate for several 

seconds; 
optionally, a drying with hot air is 
performed at the surface of the plate; 
the fibres of the sample which adhere to 
the plate are removed; and  

 
the number of sticky points adhering to 
the plate is counted, this number determining the 

adhesive character of the sample, taken at the 
surface thereof which has been used. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that a mass of cotton of a few 

grams, advantageously from 2 to 5g, is used as the 
sample, which mass of cotton is processed over a 

surface of some hundreds of cm
2
, advantageously of 
the order of 200 cm
2
. 
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the heating is performed 

between 33 and 140°C, and preferably between 50°C 
and 90°C. 
Process according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the hot 

pressure is maintained for a duration of between 
approximately 5 seconds and 30 seconds. 
Process according to one of the preceding 
Claims characterised in that the hot pressure is 

greater than 40 g/cm
2
 and preferably between 80 
g/m
2
 and 500 g/cm
2
. 
Process according to the Claims 3, 4 and 5  
 

characterised in that the magnitude of the 
pressure used for the hot pressure and the 

duration of maintenance of this pressure are 
situated higher within the ranges indicated the 

lower the temperature. 
Process according to one of the preceding 
Claims characterised in that the cold pressure is 

maintained for a duration of from 15 to 30 
seconds. 
Installation for performing the process 
according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 

in that it comprises: 

at least one roller (5) for supplying a 
continuous aluminium sheet (4); 
at least one take-up roller (6) for said 
sheet; and 
said sheet (4), held between the two 
rollers (5) and (6), forming said plate on which 

the sample is pressed. 
Installation for performing the process 
according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that, there is used, as the plate 

onto which the sample is pressed, a continuous 
belt (15), which is cleaned after the process of 

evaluation of the adhesion.  
 
Installation for performing the process 
according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that, there is used, as the plate 

onto which the sample is pressed, a plate (21) 
which is moved in front of successive hot and cold 

stations (22) for pressing the sample, brushing-drying 
(23), counting (24) and then cleaning (25). 
Process for the management of an 
installation for the treatment of fibrous 

materials such as cottons using a process for 
evaluating the adhesive nature of the fibrous 

materials used, according to any one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that the treatment 

installation is managed as function of the 
analysis parameters gathered from samples the 

adhesive character of which has been evaluated 
previously.
