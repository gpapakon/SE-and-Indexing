<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device, especially 
to a multilayer semiconductor device in which device regions are 
formed under a power supply line area and a signal line area. A conventional multilayer semiconductor device uses Bus-Line 
system of arrangement, in which a device region and a signal line 
region are arranged separately. In response to improvement of 
integration of ICs, another type of conventional multilayer 
semiconductor device including a device block located under a 
signal line region has been proposed. A Japanese Patent Publication, Kokai Heisei 2-284229, 
describes a bus-line type of semiconductor memory in which same 
phase of signal lines are arranged together to be a bunch so that 
next two signal lines in a bunch are arranged with a small space 
from each other but next two bunches are arranged with a large 
space from each other. This kind of arrangement can prevent a 
semiconductor circuit, to be mounted in the device, from mis-operating. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide an 
improved semiconductor device which can be miniaturized well. According to an aspect of the invention, a semiconductor 
device includes first layer including first and second device  
 
regions, in which semiconductor devices are formed; and a second 
layer including a signal line region, a first power supply 
region, which is one selected between power source and ground, 
and a second power supply region which is the remaining of the 
power source and ground, the second power supply region being 
horizontally positioned between the signal line and first power 
supply regions. The first device region is positioned under both 
the first and second power supply regions. The second device 
region is positioned under the signal line region and the second 
power supply region. According to another aspect of the invention, an additional 
power supply line is arranged in the signal line region to supply 
stable electric power to the second device region. Fig. 1 is a plane view illustrating the arrangement of a 
conventional semiconductor device. Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken on line A-A in Fig. 
1. Fig. 3 is a plane view illustrating the arrangement of a 
semiconductor device of a first preferred embodiment according 
to the invention. Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view taken on line B-B in Fig.

semiconductor device of a second preferred embodiment according
