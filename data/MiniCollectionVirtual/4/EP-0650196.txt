<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique of 
utilizing a master slice approach and, more particularly, to 
a semiconductor integrated circuit device and a method of 
producing the device using the master slice approach. A semiconductor integrated circuit or large scale 
integrated circuit device produced through the master slice 
approach is hereinafter referred to as a master slice type 
LSI device. The master slice approach generally comprises a 
first process of forming a master chip and a second process 
of forming a desired wiring pattern on the master chip. In 
the first process, a basic cell region including a 
plurality of basic cells, each consisting of a predetermined 
number of transistors, is formed together with an 
input/output (I/O) cell region on a chip using a common and 
fixed pattern mask. The second process is carried out in 
accordance with a specification or conditions demanded by a 
user and includes a plurality of steps. In this case, the second process normally includes 
four steps of: forming contact holes in a first insulation 
layer formed on the master chip; forming thereon a first 
wiring layer; forming through holes in a second insulation 
layer formed thereon; and forming thereon a second wiring 
layer so as to contact the first wiring layer via through 
holes. Therefore, four pattern masks corresponding to the 
contact hole, first wiring layer, through hole and second 
wiring layer are required to constitute a given circuit in 
the basic cell region. To cope with the above drawbacks, a so-called one 
custom mask approach has been recently proposed in the wiring  
 
patterning process. This one custom mask approach is a 
method of forming a wiring pattern on the master chip using 
one layer custom mask (wiring pattern mask according to a 
user's specification). According to the one custom mask 
approach, since the wiring pattern mask can be made common 
to a plurality of master slice type LSI devices, it becomes 
possible to easily realize the reduction of the turnaround 
time and the simplification of the process. An embodiment of the present invention may provide a 
master slice type LSI device and a method of producing the 
device which can greatly reduce a turnaround time. An embodiment of the present invention may apply the 
one custom mask approach to an I/O cell region of a master 
chip, thereby producing a desired master slice type LSI 
device easily and in a short period. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a semiconductor
