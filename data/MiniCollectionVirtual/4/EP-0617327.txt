<ABSTRACT>
A photographic processing apparatus is provided 
which is adapted to put photographic prints (10) and their 

corresponding index print (13) together in ejecting these two 
types of prints made in different processes. The 

apparatus includes: an printing-development mechanism (21,22) for 
photographic print; an index print making mechanism which 

reads the images of the developed film, arranges the 
images sequentially to display the same on at least one 

index print and ejects the index print through an index 
print outlet; and a print sorting device (14) which sorts out 

the photographic prints and the index print (13) corresponding 
thereto together. Time and labor for collation between 

the index print (13) and the corresponding photographic prints 
can be dispensed with.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic
processing apparatus and, more particularly, to a
photographic processing apparatus adapted to put
photographic prints and a corresponding index print
together in ejecting these two types of prints formed by
different processes.Hitherto, an index print has been formed by a
process (for example, digital printing) different from
that for the corresponding photographic prints.
Accordingly, a conventional photographic processing
apparatus is provided with an index print forming
mechanism which is arranged differently from a printing-development
mechanism for photographic print, and is
adapted to eject a plurality of photographic prints and
their corresponging index print through different outlets.
Such a conventional apparatus involves a problem that an
operator must judge the correspondence between the index
print and the photographic prints by his or her own sight
with time and labor in order to put them together.In view of the foregoing circumstance, an object
of the present invention is to provide a photographic
processing apparatus capable of putting an index print and
its corresponding photographic prints together in ejecting
these two types of prints, the index print being formed by
a process different from the printing-development process
for the photographic prints.In accordance with the present invention, there
is provided a photographic processing apparatus
comprising: a printing-development mechanism for
photographic print arranged to perform an exposure to print
respective images of frames of a developed film onto a
photographic paper, develop the photographic paper and
eject respective photographic prints of the images 
through a photographic print outlet sequentially; an index
print making mechanism arranged to read the images of the
developed film, arrange the images sequentially to
display the same on at least one index print and eject
the index print through an index print outlet; and a print
sorting device which sorts out the photographic prints
respectively having the images displayed on the index
print and puts the index print and the photographic prints
corresponding thereto together.Preferably, the index print making mechanism
includes a printer of a thermal sublimation type.Further, preferably, the print sorting device
includes a driver unit, a driving sprocket and a driven
sprocket which are coupled with the driver unit, an
endless chain wound around both the driving sprocket and
the driven sprocket, and print receivers equidistantly

A photographic processing apparatus
comprising: a printing-development mechanism (21) for

photographic print arranged to perform an exposure to print
respective images of frames of a developed film (2) onto a

photographic paper (1), develop the photographic paper and
eject respective photographic prints (10) of the images

through a photographic print outlet (24) sequentially; an index
print making mechanism arranged to read the images of the

developed film, arrange the images sequentially to
display the same on at least one index print and eject

the index print (13) through an index print outlet (25); and a print
sorting device (14) arranged to sort out the photographic prints

respectively having the images displayed on the index
print and put the index print and the photographic prints

corresponding thereto together.
The photographic processing apparatus of
Claim 1, wherein said index print making mechanism

includes a printer (12) of a thermal sublimation type.
The photographic processing apparatus of any of
Claims 1 and 2, wherein said print sorting device includes a

driver unit (31), a driving sprocket (32) and a driven sprocket (33)
which are coupled with the driver unit, an endless chain (34)

wound around both the driving sprocket and the driven
sprocket, and print receivers (35) sequidistantly spaced on the

outer periphery of the endless chain and projecting
outwardly therefrom which are each capable of receiving

said photographic prints and said index print and movable
between said photographic print outlet and said index

print outlet.
