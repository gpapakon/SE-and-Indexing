<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent composite, particularly
to an absorbent composite which is useful in personal care products.Personal care products for the absorption of body fluids are known.
Such products include adult incontinence products, diapers, training
pants, feminine care products, wound dressings and the like. As a
general rule, such personal care products generally comprise an
amount of a cellulosic fiber such as wood pulp fluff. Wood pulp
fluff is known to be a suitable absorbent for body fluids. As a
general rule, 1 gram of wood pulp fluff is able to absorb from about
5 to about 8 grams of a discharged body fluid such as urine. A
personal care product such as an infant diaper, generally has an
absorbent capacity of at least about 200 to 400 grams of urine.
Thus, when such an infant diaper is formed from wood pulp fluff, a
relatively large quantity of wood pulp fluff must be employed.In order to reduce the amount of wood pulp fluff and the
corresponding bulk of such an infant diaper, it is known to include
high absorbency materials known in the art as superabsorbents. Such
high absorbency materials are generally capable of absorbing at least
about 10, preferably at least about 20, and up to 50 or more times
their weight in water. By incorporating such high absorbency 
materials in infant diapers, it is possible to reduce the overall
bulk of the diaper while maintaining its absolute absorbent capacity.Nonetheless, the use of such high absorbency materials is not without
problems. For example, some high absorbency materials are known to
cause gel blocking. That is, as the high absorbency materials become
swollen with a liquid, they form a gelatinous mass which prevents the
free flow of liquid therethrough. Thus, while the high absorbency
materials may be able to absorb an initial insult, subsequent insults
are unable to pass through the now swollen high absorbency material.
As a result, subsequent insults tend to pool and run off of the
absorbent product.Accordingly, a number of different structures have been proposed to
alleviate or reduce the problems associated with incorporating high
absorbency materials in personal care products.U.S. Patent 4,699,619 issued October 13, 1987, to Bernardin describes
a multilayer absorbent composite having a first relatively low
density layer and a second relatively high density layer underlying
at least a portion of the first layer. A high absorbency material
(superabsorbent) is described as being located between said first and
second
