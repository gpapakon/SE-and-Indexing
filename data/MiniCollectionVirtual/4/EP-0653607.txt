<ABSTRACT>
An optical nanodisplacement producing apparatus 
is realized by employing an optical parametric 

oscillator of which cavity length is varied in correspondence 
with a wavelength or the intensity of the 

output light signal to achieve a fine-displacement 
producing mechanism. An optical nanodisplacement 

producing apparatus having high resolution less than 
0.1 nm and a highly stable characteristic is realized 

as a very fine pattern forming/monitoring apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
nanodisplacement producing apparatus. More specifically, 
the present invention concerns a nanodisplacement 
producing apparatus suitable for any of fine 
pattern producing apparatuses and measuring apparatuses, 
equipped with fine moving mechanisms of STM (Scanning 
Tunneling Microscopy), electron beam lithography 
apparatus, and scanning electron microscope and so on. In the conventional fine pattern producing/monitoring 
apparatus, the fine patterns are produced/monitored 
by employing the fine moving mechanism 
constructed of the piezoelectric elements. This conventional 
technique is described in "Introduction to 
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy" written by C. Julian 
Chen, Oxford University Press, 1993, Figure 1.1. In 
accordance with this prior art, the three-axial piezoelectric 
transducers so-called as a "tripot" are used 
to drive the probe of STM (scanning tunneling microscope). 
Since such a measuring mechanism for measuring 
the expansion dimensions of the piezoelectric transducers 
in resolution lower than 1 nanometer is not assembled 
in this STM apparatus, no positioning control of 
the probe within the plane parallel to the sample in 
the precision smaller than 1 nanometer is carried out,  
 
In other words, drifts and the like caused by thermal 
expansion of the piezoelectric transducers are not 
element to be controlled. Furthermore, there is no 
means for realizing by a single hardware, a so-called 
"zooming mechanism" for monitoring/controlling the 
distance over several tens of micrometers at high 
precision. Also, with respect to the sensitivity for 
the variations in the resonator lengths occurred in 
operations of the optical parametric oscillator, the 
publication (written by T. Debuisschert et al., "QUANTUM 
OPTICS" volume 1, pages 3 to 9, 1989) describes 
that when the length of resonator is changed from 2 nm 
to 3 nm, the oscillation of the resonator would be 
stopped. However, this publication considers the 
control of the resonator length only in view of stabilization 
of the output strengths of this optical parametric 
oscillator, but does not pay any attention to 
such a view point, i.e., effectiveness of the optical 
parametric oscillator functioning as a nanodisplacement 
element by utilizing the variation in the resonator 
lengths. A first object of the present invention is 
to provide such a means capable of achieving a highly 
stable characteristic with high resolution less than 
0.1 nanometer as a very fine pattern
