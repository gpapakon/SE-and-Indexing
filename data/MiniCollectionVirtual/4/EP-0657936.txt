<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tunnel diode provided with two metallically 
conducting electrodes (1, 2) with an insulating dielectric (3) in between, which forms a 

barrier with a barrier level for electrons and which has a thickness such that electrons 
can tunnel through th
e barrier from the one to the other electrode. Such a tunnel diode 
has the disadvantage that it has no memory. In many applications it is desirable for the 

tunnel diode to hold a certain switching state, such as open/closed. According to the 
invention, the tunnel diode is characterized in that the dielectric (3) comprises a layer of 

a material which is ferroelectric at room temperature with a remanent polarization 
which influences the barrier level. It is achieved thereby that the tunnel diode has 

various switching states in dependence on the remanent polarization of the dielectric (3). 
The switching state is maintained until the polarization of the dielectric (3) changes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tunnel diode as in the preamble of claim 1. The
invention also relates to a memory device comprising such a tunnel diode.Such a tunnel diode is known from: S.M. Sze: Physics of semiconductor
devices, chapter 9: Tunnel devices. The tunnel diode is also known as an MIM ("metal-insulator-metal")
or MIS ("metal-insulator-semiconductor") diode, where "metal" is
understood to mean a well-conducting material. Electrons can tunnel from one to the
other electrode, given a voltage across the electrodes in excess of the threshold voltage.
The electrons cannot tunnel across the barrier at a voltage below the threshold voltage.
Such switching elements are highly suitable for use at high frequencies.The known tunnel diode described has the disadvantage that it has no
memory. It is desirable in many applications for the tunnel diode to retain a certain
switching state, such as open/closed, under practical conditions such as room
temperature. Moreover, it is desired for certain applications that the tunnel diode has
more than two different switching states.The invention has for its object inter alia to counteract the said
disadvantages.According to the invention, the device is for this purpose characterized as
in the characterizing part of claim 1. It is achieved thereby that the tunnel diode has
more than two switching states in dependence on the remanent polarization of the dielectric.
The value and the direction of the polarization influence the barrier level or, in other
words, the shape of the barrier is changed by the remanent polarization of the
ferroelectric dielectric. Given a certain voltage at the electrodes, more or fewer
electrons can then tunnel through the dielectric depending on the barrier level, so that
more or less tunnel current can flow through the tunnel diode. The tunnel diode
accordingly has several switching states. The ferroelectric dielectric may be switched
from one polarization state to another in that a voltage is applied across the dielectric
such that an electric switching field of the ferroelectric material is achieved in the
dielectric. The switching state is held until the polarization state of the dielectric 
changes. Due to the fact that the insulating material comprises two or more layers of
different ferroelectric material which have the respective directions of their remanent
polarization changing at respective different electric fields, the tunnel diode has more
than two switching states. The insulating material may be grown, for example, in the
form
