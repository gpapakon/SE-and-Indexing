<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat assembly (10) with a structural seat back (14) to 
accommodate the seat belt loads applied to the seat back by the 

belt system which is carried by the seat assembly. The seat back (14) 
includes a reinforced beam (36) along one side of the seat back frame 

(34) to accommodate these loads with a recliner mechanism along the 
same side of the seat assembly and engaging the reinforced member (36) 

to resist forward rotation of the seat back caused by seat belt 
loads applied thereto. The seat assembly while being reinforced 

to accommodate the seat belt loads is configured to be as similar 
to conventional seat assemblies as possible to minimize the need 

to redesign the non-structural components of the seat assembly. 
In addition, the seat assembly includes many features found in 

current production seat assemblies such as a fore and aft adjuster, 
an adjustable lumbar support (202), a seat cushion lift means and a 

seat back recliner. While reinforcing the seat structure, care has 
been taken to efficiently manage the seat belt loads without adding 

unnecessary structure and weight to the seat assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle seat assembly and 
in particular to a seat assembly that also carries a seat belt 
system and is configured to withstand the high seat belt loads 
incurred during a vehicle collision. Vehicle seat belt systems are typically mounted directly to 
the vehicle structure. For example, most belt systems have the 
belt retractor mounted to the vehicle floor pan with the belt 
webbing extending upwardly along the B-pillar of the vehicle to 
a D-ring mounted to the pillar. The webbing then extends 
downward to a belt end connected to the vehicle floor adjacent 
to the retractor. A clasp is slidably movable between the end 
of the seat belt anchored to the vehicle floor and the D-ring on 
the B-pillar. A buckle is attached to the vehicle floor on the 
opposite side of the seat. When the clasp is pulled across the 
user and inserted into the buckle, the webbing forms a lap belt 
and a shoulder belt to retain the occupant in the seat assembly. The position of the vehicle seat assembly in the vehicle is 
adjustable in at least the fore and aft direction. With 
adjustment, the seat assembly is moved relative to the seat belt 
attachment points such that it can become inconvenient and 
uncomfortable for a seat occupant to use the seat belt. For 
example, if the vehicle seat is moved to its forwardmost 
position, it may be difficult to reach back to grasp the seat 
belt clasp along the B-pillar. In addition, with the seat moved 
forward, the shoulder belt may rub across the occupant's neck  
 
creating a discomfort. If the seat is adjusted to its 
rearwardmost position, the shoulder belt may be located too 
far forward relative to the occupant such that the person's 
torso can move forward some distance unrestrained by the 
shoulder belt. DE-A-2 166 822 discloses a vehicle seat assembly in 
accordance with the preamble of claim 1. The first and 
second generally upright members of the seat back frame are 
each braced by recliner means in the form of a diagonally 
extending recliner brace. These recliner braces are 
adjustable so as to vary the inclination of the seat back 
frame relative to the lower seat frame. EP-A-0 451 035, published 
on 09.10.91 and therefore belonging to the state of the art pursuant 
to Art. 54(3) EPC, discloses another similar arrangement wherein 
recliner means including recliner braces pivotally coupled between 
the back frame and the lower seat frame are provided on both sides 
of the seat assembly. EP-A-0 451 035 is not prior art at all
