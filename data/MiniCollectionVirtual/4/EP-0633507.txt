<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic photosensitive member 
is constituted by disposing a photosensitive layer on 

an electroconductive support. The photosensitive 
layer is characterized by containing an arylamine 

compound having specific two fluorenyl groups. The 
photosensitive member is suitable for providing an 

electrophotographic apparatus showing excellent 
electrophotographic characteristics such as a high 

photosensitivity, a good potential stability in 
repetitive use, a decreased pause memory, and no crack 

in the photosensitive layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic photosensitive member 
(hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "photosensitive 
member"), particularly to a photosensitive member 
having a photosensitive layer containing a specific 
arylamine compound. The present invention also relates to a 
process cartridge and electrophotographic apparatus 
respectively using the photosensitive member. There have been known many photosensitive 
members having a laminate-type structure, wherein a 
photosensitive layer comprises a charge generation 
layer (CGL) containing a charge-generating material 
(CGM) such as organic photoconductive dyes or pigments 
and a charge transport layer (CTL) containing a 
charge-transporting material (CTM) (i.e., so-called 
"function-separation type photosensitive member"). 
Such a function-separation type photosensitive member 
has brought about a considerable improvement on a 
conventional organic photosensitive member possessing 
defects such as low sensitivity and poor durability. The function-separation type photosensitive  
 
member allows a wide latitude in selecting a CGM and a 
CTM. As a result, it is possible to prepare readily a 
photosensitive member having desired electrophotographic 
characteristics. As examples of the CTM, there have been known 
various materials including: a pyrazoline compound as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) No. 
4188/1977; a hydrazone compound as disclosed in JP-B 
42380/1980 or Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 
(JP-A) No. 52063/1980; a triphenylamine compound as 
disclosed in JP-B 32372/1983 or JP-A 132955/1986; a 
stilbene compound as disclosed in JP-A 151955/1979 or 
JP-A 198043/1983; and an arylamine compound as 
disclosed in JP-A 78756/1991. Characteristics required for the CTM may 
include: 
(i) Stability against light and/or heat, (ii) Stability against ozone, NOx and nitric acid 
generated by corona discharge, (iii) High charge (carrier)-transporting ability, (iv) Good compatibility with an organic solvent 
and/or a binder resin, (v) Easiness of production and inexpensiveness. In recent years, the photosensitive member 
has encountered a new problem of "pause memory 
phenomenon" which is one of deterioration phenomena 
caused by corona products. More specifically, a pause  
 
memory phenomenon is such a phenomenon that a 
chargeability of the photosensitive member at a part 
facing a corona charging device is decreased when the 
rotation of the photosensitive member is paused to 
terminated after repetitive
