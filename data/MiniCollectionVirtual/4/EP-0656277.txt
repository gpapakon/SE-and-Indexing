<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat assembly (10) includes a fixed seat portion (20) which is 
adapted to be mounted on the floor of a vehicle and a movable seat portion 

(21) which is mounted on the fixed seat portion by a pivot mechanism (22) 
located at the rear outboard side of the seat assembly, enabling the movable 

seat portion to be pivoted between a use or drive position and an access 
position where the front edge of the movable seat portion overlies the sill 

(17) of the vehicle to facilitate egress from the vehicle, and releaseable latch 
mechanism (81) for latching the movable seat portion to the fixed seat 

portion to prevent unwanted movement of the movable seat portion. Also 
disclosed are systems wherein the movable seat cushion arrangement is 

supplemented by hand grips (191, 193, 195, 196, 198) on the vehicle 
positioned to be grasped by an individual upon ingress into or egress from 

the vehicle to facilitate the ingress by an individual into and egress out of a 
vehicle through a door opening of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seat assemblies for motor vehicles and the 
like, and more particularly to a pivoting seat cushion arrangement for vehicle 
seat assemblies. Ingress into and egress from motor vehicles such as passenger cars, 
station Wagons, vans and the like, can be a difficult task, especially for 
individuals with movement impairments due to disability, illness, or advanced 
age. A number of arrangements have been proposed which aid in the 
transfer process, primarily through seat and door mechanisms. Most of 
these arrangements address individuals with moderate to severe disabilities, 
and in particular wheelchair users. Thus, the arrangements incorporate 
mechanisms which move the individual completely out of the vehicle. As a 
result, these mechanisms are very complicated and expensive and are not 
available for general use. In Great Britain Patent Application no. 2 088 296, entitled Vehicle 
Seats, there is disclosed a vehicle seat particularly applicable to individuals 
with a movement impairment who are confined to wheelchairs. The vehicle  
 
seat is mounted on a swivel for pivoting movement about a pivot axis, the 
swivel being mounted on an arm which, in turn, is pivotally coupled to the 
door pillar so that the seat can be swung from a position of normal use to a 
position outside the door opening of the vehicle. The seat pivoting 
mechanism includes a guide track which ensures that the seat faces 
inwardly as it moves through the door opening. Providing a pivotally 
mounted, swiveling seat that is moved along a guide track for orienting the 
seat in an inwardly facing direction as it moves through the door opening, 
requires a complicated transport mechanism for the vehicle seat. Also, the 
pivot is mounted on the sidewall of the vehicle and extends vertically from 
the roof to the floor of the vehicle along the side of the seat so that the pivot 
axis is displaced rearwardly and laterally of the swivel mounted seat. The 
combined swivel and pivot mounting of the vehicle seat results in a 
movement that is considerably different from the movement encountered by 
an individual during normal egress from a vehicle. Moreover, this seat does 
not appear adaptable to provide conventional fore and aft seat adjustment, 
reclining seat capability, or a seat dumpingcapability as is required for two 
door vehicles, and as such, this seat arrangement has limited application. In Australian patent application no. 82409/82, entitled Vehicle Seat 
Mounting Mechanism, which was filed on April 7,

<CLAIMS>
A single occupant vehicle seat assembly (10) comprising:a seat 
cushion assembly (12) and a seat back assembly (14) mounted on said seat 

cushion assembly; said seat cushion assembly including a first seat portion (20) 
having first cushion material (20a) which defines a fixed partial seat cushion 

section of the vehicle seat assembly and a second seat portion (21) having 
second cushion material (21a) which defines a movable partial seat cushion 

section of the vehicle seat assembly; mounting means (22, 23, 24, 38) for 
mounting said second seat portion on said first seat portion for movement 

relative to said first seat portion, said mounting means including pivot means 
(22) defining a substantially vertical pivot axis for permitting said second seat 

portion to pivot relative to said first seat portion about said pivot axis in a 
substantially horizontal plane between a forward facing use position and an 

access position where et least a portion of one edge of said second seat 
portion overlies the rocker (17) of the vehicle to facilitate ingress into and 

egress from the vehicle through a doorway of the vehicle; said movable partial 
seat cushion section being adapted to nest with said fixed partial seat cushion 

 
section when said second seat portion is in said use position, whereby said 

fixed and movable partial seat cushion sections provide the appearance of a 

whole seat cushion for the vehicle seat assembly when said second seat 
portion is in said use position. 
The vehicle seat assembly according to claim 1, wherein said first 
seat portion includes third cushion material (20b) which defines a first partial 

seat back section of the vehicle seat assembly, and said second seat portion 
includes fourth cushion material (21b) which defines a second partial seat back 

section of the vehicle seat assembly, said second partial seat back section 
being adapted to nest with said first partial seat back section when said second 

seat portion is in said use position whereby said first and second partial seat 
back sections provide the appearance of a whole seat back cushion for the 

vehicle seat assembly. 
The vehicle seat assembly according to claim 2, wherein said third 
cushion material includes first and second vertically extending portions (28)
