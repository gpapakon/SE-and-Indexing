nanoparticle or nanocapsule, with a crosslinked protein-based wall, 

characterized in that it is obtained by an interfacial crosslinking reaction 
between a protein and a crosslinking agent comprising at least two 

acylating groups that react with the reactive acylatable groups of said 
protein, thus giving said nanoparticle or nanocapsule with a crosslinked 

protein-based wall.

characterized in that the abovementioned protein is selected from the group 

consisting of an animal protein such as elastin, keratin, silk, albumin, milk 
protein or structural protein such as collagen, especially collagen without 

telopeptide or atelocollagen; a vegetable protein such as wheat, maize, oat 
or almond protein; and a protein originating from the marine environment, 

especially from fish or algae or else from plankton or microplankton. 
The nanoparticle or nanocapsule according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the abovementioned protein comprises collagen, 

atelocollagen or a mixture of atelocollagen and glycosaminoglycan.

preceding claims, characterized in that it contains a water-soluble, 

liposoluble or insoluble active principle for use in cosmetics, 
pharmaceuticals or foodstuffs. 
The nanoparticle or nanocapsule according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the abovementioned glycosaminoglycan is 

chondroitine 4-sulfate. 
The nanoparticle or nanocapsule according to one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the crosslinking agent comprising at least two

protein is selected from the group consisting of an acid dichloride, in 

particular terephthaloyl chloride, phthalic acid chloride, sebacic acid 
chloride, succinic acid chloride, the chloride of a tricarboxylic acid such as 

citric acid, or an acid anhydride such as succinic anhydride.  
 
A cosmetic, pharmaceutical or food composition, characterized in 
that it comprises a nanoparticle or a nanocapsule as defined in any one of 

the preceding claims. 
A process for the production of particles or of capsules of 
dimensions of less than 1 µm, called nanoparticles or nanocapsules, with 

crosslinked protein-based walls, characterized in that it comprises 
preparing a nanoemulsion comprising an aqueous phase containing a 

protein and an oily phase containing an interfacial crosslinking agent 
comprising at least two acylating groups that react with the acylatable 

groups of said protein, thus forming microparticles or microcapsules whose 
walls are based on a protein crosslinked by said crosslinking agent. 
The process according to claim 9, characterized in that a 
viscosity modifier is added to one of the two phases so as to reduce the 

viscosity difference between the liquid phases present in order to obtain 
said nanoemulsion.
