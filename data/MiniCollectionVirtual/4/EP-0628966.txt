<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a semiconductor memory device in which a first 
control signal is externally input to an input buffer 

circuit (50). A second control signal output from the input 
buffer circuit is input to an internal circuit. The 

internal circuit comprises a memory cell array (1) having a 
number of memory cells (C) and peripheral circuits (25A) for writing 

and reading cell information in and from the memory cells, 
and the writing and reading operations are executed based 

on the second control signal. Read data output from the 

internal circuit is input to an output buffer, which 
outputs the read data as output data. Power from a common 

power supply is supplied to the input buffer circuit and 
the output buffer. A noise-remove signal generator, which 

is connected to the input buffer circuit, functions based 
on either one of the first control signal and the second 

control signal to generate a noise remove signal in 
synchronism with an output timing of the output data. A 

noise removing circuit removes noise from the second 
control signal based on the noise remove signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory 
device. More particularly, this invention relates to a static 
RAM (SRAM) in which bit lines and data lines, sharing common 
bit lines, (pairs of common data lines) are precharged to a 
predetermined voltage level. In the conventional SRAM, data read from a memory cell is 
transferred to a sense amplifier via a pair of bit lines and 
a pair of common data lines. The data is than amplified by 
the sense amplifier. The sense amplifier operates most 
efficiently when the voltage level of the data read from the 
memory cell is at a voltage level intermediate to that of the 
power source. To facilitate this, conventional SRAMs 
incorporate circuitry to shift the voltage level of the data 
read from the memory cells to an intermediate level. A level 
shifter suitable for such a sense amplifier is proposed in 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 1-192078. This 
level shifter is illustrated in Fig. 1. A memory cell array 101 shown in Fig. 1 has plural pairs of 
word lines WL0 and plural pairs of bit lines. Fig. 1 shows 
only one pair of bit lines BL0 and /BL0. A memory cell C0 is 
connected between each word line and an associated pair of bit 
lines. Each cell C0 comprises cell transistors T41 and T42 
and gate transistors T43 and T44, with resistors R11 and R12 
as their loads. The resistor R11 and the transistor T41 are  
 
connected in series, and the resistor R12 and the transistor 
T42 are connected in series, the former series circuit being 
connected in parallel to the latter one between a power source 
VDD and ground VSS. When any one of the word lines and an 
associated pair of bit lines are selected, the cell connected 
to the selected word line and pair of bit lines is selected. 
Data in that cell is then read onto the pair of bit lines. Connected to each pair of bit lines BL0 and /BL0 is a bit 
equalizer 102 for precharging that pair of bit lines. The 
equalizer 102 utlizies PMOS transistor T45, T46 and T47. A pair of common data lines LD0 and /LD0 are respectively 
connected to each pair of bit lines BL0 and /BL0 via column 
switches 103 and 104. The switch 103 comprises a PMOS 
transistor T48 and an NMOS transistor T49, and the switch 104 
comprises a PMOS transistor T50 and an NMOS transistor T51. 
A signal which is a column selection signal CD inverted by an 
inverter 105 is input to the gates of the transistors T48 and 
T50, and the column selection signal CD is input to the gates 
of the transistors T49 and T51. When the
