<ABSTRACT>
A device (10) for detecting loose ends in tobacco articles such as cigarettes comprises a stationary cam (22) for positioning the articles prior to reaching a flat sensor surface (14). A pair of concentric electrodes (16, 18) are arranged on the sensor surface (14) for generating an electric field. Cigarettes are moved through the field so as to create a field disturbance. Deviations from a predetermined field disturbance indicate that a cigarette is defective. A piece of thin glass (24) of about 5.5 mils, covers the sensor surface (14) and is adhered thereto to protect against wear. Compared to surface protecting members previously used, the glass member (24) significantly extends the wear life of the sensor, improves the sensitivity of the device, improves detection accuracy, and eliminates the need for daily readjustment of the field.

 DESCRIPTION IMPROVED LOOSE END DETECTOR FOR TOBACCO ARTICLESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to sensors that can determine by capacitive means the density of tobacco in articles such as cigarettes, cigars, and the like, and in particular devices for detecting loose ends in cigarettes. Cigarettes are manufactured using high speed machinery, which performs various steps in forming and cutting tobacco rods, and attaching a filter plug to one end of the tobacco cylinder using a tipping paper. At one or more stages of the process, it is important to confirm that the tobacco end of the cigarette is packed properly with tobacco, and to remove cigarettes where the tobacco is loose.U.S. Patent No. 3,993,194 discloses a device for detecting loose ends in tobacco articles which utilizes a capacitive sensor for detecting variations in the tobacco density at the tobacco end. A capacitive sensor has a flat surface containing a center electrode and an annular electrode arranged concentrically therewith, thus resembling a bulls-eye target, which generates an electric sensing field through which the tobacco ends pass.In the apparatus of U.S. Patent No. 3,993,194, the flat sensor surface is arranged at the end of a stationary cam, which is in the form of an angled plate. Cigarettes are moved sequentially along the cam, with their axis perpendicular to the cam, such that the tobacco ends bear against the angled surface of the cam. As the cigarettes move along the cam surface, the cam acts to adjust the position of each cigarette longitudinally so that each cigarette is at a uniform location when it reaches the sensor, and bears directly against the flat sensor surface as it moves past the 

sensor electrodes. As a result, each cigarette follows an identical path through the electric field created by the electrodes.In the '194 patent, a high frequency voltage source applies the field across the electrodes. As each cigarette moves through the field, the field varies, the change in field strength being a function of the density of tobacco in the cigarette end. The variation in the electric field is measured and compared with a reference signal. If the difference falls outside a preselected range of acceptable values, thus indicating a loose tobacco end, the defective cigarette is removed. The '194 apparatus may also be used with a group of cigarettes, which are moved as a unit past the sensor, in a similar manner.A capacitance sensor which utilizes a bulls-eye target electrode and a stationary

We claim:
1. In a device for sensing the density of tobacco comprising a flat sensor surface, means for generating a capacitance field emanating from said sensor surface, means for adjusting said capacitance field, means for moving a desired portion of a tobacco article past said sensor surface in contact therewith so as to move through the electric field, and a protective member covering said sensor surface to protect said sensor surface against wear, the improvement wherein said protective member comprises a thin piece of flat glass adhered to said sensor surface, whereby the wear life is extended indefinitely, the sensitivity of the field is enhanced, and variations in positioning the tobacco article in the field, due to localized wear of the protective member, are virtually eliminated.
2. A device according to claim 1, including means for orienting tobacco articles generally perpendicular to said sensor surface and for moving tobacco ends of the articles past said sensor surface, and further comprising a stationary cam positioned for engaging tobacco ends of tobacco articles prior to said sensor surface for locating each tobacco end at a predetermined position to contact said sensor surface, wherein said protective member comprises a piece of glass covering both said cam and sensor surface to provide a continuous, smooth guide surface for the tobacco ends along said cam and sensor surface. 3. A device according to claim 2, wherein said glass has a thickness within a range of 4 mils to 40 mils.
4. A device according to claim 2, wherein said glass has a thickness of about 5.5 mils. 5. A device according to claim 3, wherein said means for generating a capacitance field comprises a 


first electrode and an annular electrode concentrically arranged on said sensor surface.
