<ABSTRACT>
A varactor (10, 115, 122) is formed using a BICMOS 
process flow. An N well (28) of a varactor region (13) 

is formed in an epitaxial layer (22) by doping the 
epitaxial layer (22) with an N type dopant. A cathode 

region (55, 132) is formed in the N well (28) by further 
doping the N well (28) with the N type dopant. Cathode 

electrodes (91, 114) are formed by patterning a layer of 
polysilicon (62, 86) over the epitaxial layer (22). 

Subsequently, the cathode electrodes (91, 114) are doped 
with an N type dopant. A region adjacent the cathode 

region (55, 132) is doped to form a lightly doped region 
(103, 117). The lightly doped region (103, 117) is doped 

with a P type dopant to form an anode region (109, 119).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to varactors 
and more particularly to integrated varactors and methods 
of fabricating integrated varactors. Semiconductor capacitors are used in a variety of 
applications including operational amplifier frequency 
compensation, conversion of analog signals to digital 
signals, modulation of logic output voltage rise and fall 
times, etc. Fabrication of semiconductor capacitors 
using monolithic integrated circuit fabrication 
techniques is well known in the semiconductor art. A 
particularly useful type of semiconductor capacitor is 
the voltage variable capacitor, more commonly referred to 
as a varactor. Varactors are used in a variety of 
applications such as the electronic tuning of oscillators 
and the mixing or the generation of harmonics of 
electrical signals. Due to the difficulty in fabricating 
varactors having a low series resistance, a desirable 
change in capacitance for a given change in voltage, and 
a low DC leakage current using high performance 
integrated circuit processes, these devices are typically 
manufactured as discrete components having an electrical 
contact on each side of a semiconductor substrate. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a 
method of manufacturing a varactor that is readily 
incorporated into a high performance integrated circuit  
 
process and that provides a low series resistance and a 
desirable change in capacitance for a given change in 
voltage. FIGs. 1-10 are highly enlarged cross-sectional
