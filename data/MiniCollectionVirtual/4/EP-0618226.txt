<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to peptide derivatives
having antiviral properties and to means for using
the derivatives to treat viral infections. More
specifically, the invention relates to peptide
derivatives (hereinafter called "peptides")
exhibiting activity against herpes viruses, to
pharmaceutical compositions comprising the
peptides, to methods of using the peptides to
inhibit in vitro the replication of herpes virus and to
the use of said compounds for the preparation
of a medicament for the treatment of
herpes infections.Herpes viruses inflict a wide range of
diseases against humans and animals. For
instance; herpes simplex viruses, types 1 and 2
(HSV-1 and HSV-2), are responsible for cold sores
and genital lesions, respectively; varicella
zoster virus (VZV) causes chicken pox and
shingles; and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes
infectious mononucleosis.Over the past two decades, a class of
compounds known as the purine and pyrimidine
nucleoside analogs has received the most attention
by investigators in the search for new therapeutic
agents for treatment of herpes virus infections.
As a result, several nucleoside analogs have been
developed as antiviral agents. The most
successful to date is acyclovir which is the agent 
of choice for treating genital herpes simplex
infections.Nevertheless, in spite of some significant
advances, the need for effective, safe therapeutic
agents for treating herpes viral infections
continues to exist. For a review of current
therapeutic agents in this area, see M.C. Nahata,
"Antiviral Drugs: Pharmacokinetics, Adverse
Effects and Therapeutic Use", J. Pharm. Technol.,
3, 100 (1987).The present application discloses a group of
peptide derivatives having activity against herpes
viruses. The selective action of these peptides
against herpes viruses, combined with a wide
margin of safety, renders the peptides as
desirable agents for combating herpes infections.The following references disclose peptides or
peptide derivatives which have been associated
with antiherpes activity:

A process for preparing a peptide as defined

in claim 1, or a therapeutically acceptable salt thereof,
comprising:


a) stepwise coupling, in the order of the sequence of the
peptide, of the amino acid or derived amino acid residues, and

non-peptidic fragments of the peptide, in which

i) reactive side chain groups of the residue or fragments
are protected with suitable protective groups to

prevent chemical reactions from occurring at that site
until the protective group is ultimately removed after

the completion of the stepwise coupling;
ii) an α-amino group of a coupling reactant is protected
by an α-amino protective group while the free carboxy

group of that reactant couples with the free α-amino
group of the second reactant; the α-amino protective

group being one which can be selectively removed to
allow the subsequent coupling step to take place at

that α-amino group; and
iii) the C-terminal carboxyl of the amino acid residue of
the amino acid residue or peptide fragment, which is

to become the C-terminal function of the protected
peptide, if present, is protected with a suitable

protective group which will prevent chemical reaction
occurring at that site until after the desired amino

acid sequence for the peptide has been assembled; and
b) at the completion of the coupling, eliminating any protecting
groups and, if required, effecting standard transformations to

obtain the peptide of claim 1; and if desired, converting the
peptide into a therapeutically acceptable salt.
