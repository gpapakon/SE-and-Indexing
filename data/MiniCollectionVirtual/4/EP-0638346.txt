<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dispersible
antifoam formulation containing a silicone for incorporation
into concentrated liquid detergents wherein the antifoam
formulation provides a stable, uniform detergent with
controlled foaming behavior.A defoamer or antifoam agent is a material which,
when added in low concentration to a foaming liquid controls
the foam problem. The defoamer equilibrates the rate of
foam collapse with the rate of foam formation. Such
materials, in addition, remove unsightly and troublesome
surface foam, improve filtration, watering, washing and
drainage, of various types of suspensions, mixtures and
slurries. Defoamers have found application in such areas as
the pulp and paper industry, paints and latex, coating
processes, fertilizers, textiles, fermentation processes,
metal working, adhesive, caulk and polymer manufacture, the
sugar beet industry, oil well cement, cleaning compounds,
cooling towers and in chemical processes of varied
description, such as municipal and industrial primary and
secondary waste water treatment facilities. It is essential
for a defoamer that it be inert and not capable of reacting
with the product or system in which it is used and that it
have no adverse affect on the product or system.The inclusion of a silicone defoamer or silicone
antifoam agent in a liquid detergent is not new, however, it
is uncommon. The reason is that it is particularly
difficult to homogeneously disperse antifoam formulations
into aqueous mediums such as liquid detergents. A liquid
detergent is a complex chemical formulation and the
complexity of such formulations hinder a homogeneous 
dispersion of the antifoam composition within the detergent.
The result is loss of uniformity, as well as flocculates of
antifoam accumulating at the surface of the detergent. One
of the overriding trends of today is the move toward more
concentrated liquid detergents. This trend offers the
inherent efficiency of manufacture and use of liquid
formulas, such as pumpability and easy measuring of liquids,
while reducing the burden of packaging and shipping costs.
This trend is occurring in both the consumer market and in
industrial formulations.The move toward concentrated liquids entails the
reduction of water content in a formulated liquid. This
produces an increase in electrolyte and solids levels in
liquid detergent formulas. Another shift is the dependence
on non-aqueous solvents to aid in the solubilization of
detergent components such as surfactants. These changes
make stabilization of
