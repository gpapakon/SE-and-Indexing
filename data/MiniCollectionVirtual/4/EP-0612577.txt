<ABSTRACT>
New solder compositions which can have improved mechanical 
properties are disclosed. In a preferred embodiment, the solder comprises a matrix 

material and magnetically dispersed particles. A desirable dispersion of the magnetic 
particles in the matrix material, is accomplished by applying a magnetic field to the 

molten matrix material containing magnetic particles and solidifying it in the 
presence of the magnetic field. The particle-dispersed microstructures improve the 

mechanical properties of the solder composition. The improved solder composition 
can be made into a powder to be used in solder paste, cream or reshaped while 

substantially retaining the improved mechanical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solder materials with improved mechanical 
properties and a method of making such a solder. Solder is an almost ubiquitous constituent of, e.g., electronic and opto-electronic 
systems. Among the many available solder alloys, the lead-tin (Pb-Sn) 
solder system is by far the most commonly used in industry today. However, even 
that mature solder system still has shortcomings, including joint failures. Such 
failures are frequently caused by creep and thermal fatigue. Stresses induced during 
thermal cycling because of thermal expansion mismatch are usually unevenly 
distributed, causing local recrystallization and microstructural coarsening. Such 
structural coarsening can lead to thermal fatigue crack growth and solder joint 
failure. Such fatigue and creep problems can be reduced by stabilizing a fine, 
mechanically strong microstructure and preventing structural coarsening through 
dispersion of fine particles (e.g., Cu6Sn5) in the solder matrix. See, e.g. 
R. B. Clough, et al., Proc. NEPCON WEST '92, Feb. 23-27, 1992, Anaheim, CA, 
Cahners Exposition Group, 1992, "Preparation and Properties of Reflowed Paste and 
Bulk Composite Solder", p. 1256. However, providing a uniform mixture of fine 
particles and molten solder is not an easy task as the density difference between the 
dispersoid particles and the molten solder (e.g., the density of Sn-Sb solder is 
approximately 7.2, that of Pb-Sn approximately 8.5, and that of Fe is approximately 
7.9) often causes gravity-induced segregation of the particles, resulting in a 
macroscopically nonuniform particle distribution. Agglomeration and coarsening of the particles is another frequently 
encountered problem. Because of these problems relatively large amounts (e.g. 10-40% 
by volume) of dispersoid typically is required in prior art compositions to 
obtain detectable strengthening and improvement in creep resistance. The presence 
of large amounts of dispersoid particles, however, tends to cause deleterious side 
effects such as loss of molten solder fluidity and porosity trapping. The use of other 
dispersoid particles in the Pb-Sn solder has been disclosed by, e.g., J. L. Marshall et 
al., Proc. NEPCON WEST, "Microcharacterization of Composite Solders", p. 1278, 
(1992), however, no significant improvement in creep resistance was reported.  
 A further shortcoming of Pb-Sn solder is its toxicity. Because pending 
legislation and EPA regulations threaten to make the use of Pb in solder much more 
expensive, or even ban the use
