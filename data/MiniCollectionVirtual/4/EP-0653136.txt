<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of telecommunications.
More particularly the invention relates to the field of
distribution systems. In still greater particularity, the
invention relates to a hybrid distribution architecture for
providing video and telephony signals to customer premises
equipment according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a method
for providing video and telephony services to customer
premises equipment according to the preamble of claim 7. The
present invention deals with the provision of video and
telephony services combined with a power distribution network.Information, and access to it, has received significant
attention recently. The building of an "information highway"
compared to the national interstate highway system begun in
the 1950s has been made a national priority. There are
currently three wireline transport elements available for such
a highway: (1) fiber optic cable; (2) coaxial cable; and (3)
twisted copper pair cable ("twisted pair"). Presently, twisted
pair cable predominates, certainly in the local loop portion
of telephone networks. Coaxial cable has been used widely by
cable television companies and both telephone companies and
cable companies have made use of fiber optics for main or
trunk line signal transport. Fiber optic cable can carry more information over a greater distance than coaxial
cable, while coaxial cable can carry more information over a greater distance than twisted
pairs. Because twisted pair is the predominant local loop technology at least in the telephone
industry, attempts have been made to develop technologies which will increase the carrying
capacity of copper. In reality, copper wire is a very efficient transport means for traditional
telephony services.Because of their high bit rate transport capability, fiber optic-based systems are
preferable to copper-based networks even those using digital compression. Information
services that require true broadband rates require fiber or coaxial cable technology, as a
practical matter. Even low-end (i.e., POTS "plain old telephone service") services will
reflect a lower per-subscriber cost on fiber, compared to present copper-based delivery
systems. Specifically, fiber-based systems that provide residence telephony to groups of 4-8
subscribers with fiber to the curb (FTTC) are expected to achieve cost parity with copper in
the near future. However, the cost to replace the existing copper plant in the U.S. with fiber
optics is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. Thus the length of time
