<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus are disclosed for identifying normal biomedical specimens (202). Image data (120) is gathered representing an image of the specimen (202). The image data (120) is processed (114) to measure features of the objects (204) to determine (320) whether the object (204) is normal. The feature measurements for all objects (204) in the specimen (202) are then combined to determine (208) whether the specimen (202) as a whole is normal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward a
method for analyzing data representing the image of
biomedical specimens and, more particularly, a
method for analyzing data representing the image of
biomedical specimens to identify normal (negative)
biomedical specimens.With increasing progress in data processing
technology, both hardware and software, biomedical
imaging systems are becoming more and more
prevalent. Presently, image gathering systems have
been developed for providing images of human anatomy
such as, for example, magnetic resonance imaging
devices, ultrasound imaging, computer tomography
imaging, etc. Image enhancement systems are
typically used for processing data to be used to
provide an improved image of organs of a patient, as
for example, the patient's heart, lungs, etc.
However, image enhancement systems make no attempt
to diagnose the biomedical status of the functional
systems of the patient.Other image analysis systems have been
developed for analyzing image data of specimens
taken from a patient to augment the physician
diagnosis of the biomedical status of the patient.
As examples, image analysis systems have been
provided for obtaining image data representing blood
cells, bone marrow cells, brain cells, etc. Image
analysis systems are typically designed to process
image data to determine characteristics of the
specimen, as for example, blood cell count.
Although these systems make some attempt to analyze 
the collected data, these systems have not been used
significantly to diagnose the overall quality or
condition of the specimen, e.g., as either normal
(negative) or abnormal. Conversely, these systems
have been used primarily as prescreening systems to
identify those portions of a specimen that require
further inspection by a human.As an example, image analysis systems have
been provided to screen portions of a cervical Pap
smear. These systems typically require special
(nonstandard) preparation for the cervical Pap smear
specimen before the specimen can be examined. This
is because a typical cervical Pap smear specimen,
that may be examined by a cytotech without the aid
of an imaging system, includes layers and chunks of
cells that cannot readily be imaged using available
data processing technology. However, the special
preparation required for these image analysis
systems adds an additional step in the preparation
and, therefore, increases the overall expense and
complexity of the analysis.Still further, image analysis systems
presently available for performing image

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining if a biomedical specimen image (120) is
normal, the image being of a first object (204) neighboured by a plurality of

other objects (204) on a biological specimen slide (112), the method comprising the
steps of using an image gathering system (102) controlled by a data processing

system (114) for

a) obtaining (300) the image with the image gathering system and
identifying with the data processing system the objects in said image;

said method being characterised by
b) measuring (304) with the data processing system a feature value for
each of said plurality of other objects;
c) classifying (304, 314) with the data processing system said plurality of
other objects as either normal or abnormal based on the feature values;
d) using the data processing system to combine (316) the
classifications of the plurality of other objects to provide for the

biomedical image, a normal or abnormal rating of the first object; and
e) identifying (320) the image as normal if the rating is determined
as normal.
The method of Claim 1, including:

f) measuring with the data processing system a feature value for
said first object,
g) classifying with the data processing system the first object as
either normal or abnormal based on the associated feature value; and
h) combining the classification of the first object with the
classifications of the plurality of other objects in step (d) to provide said

rating.
The method of Claim 1 or 2 wherein step (a) comprises obtaining
a field of view of the first object and plurality of other objects with the 

image gathering system and generating a mask of object identifiers (OB(x)) for the
field of view to identify the first object (OB) and plurality of other objects (OB)

within the field of view.
The method of Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the feature value for each
of said plurality of other objects corresponds to a region of feature space,

and step (c) comprises for each of said plurality of other objects, the steps
of:-


inputting the associated feature value into a modified binary
decision tree wherein each terminal node of the modified binary decision

tree identifies a region of the feature space, each terminal node having
assigned predetermined confidence values thereto;
selecting a terminal node of the modified binary decision tree
corresponding to the region of the feature space that corresponds to said

associated feature value;
assigning to the associated one of said plurality of other objects, the
plurality of predetermined confidence values for the selected terminal

node; and
classifying said associated object as either normal or abnormal on
the basis of the confidence values assigned to the associated object.
The method of Claim 4, wherein each terminal node has assigned
thereto a confidence value that indicates a likelihood that the object is an

artifact, a second confidence value that indicates a likelihood that the
object is normal cell, and a third confidence value that indicates a

likelihood that the object is abnormal.
The method of any preceding claim wherein the feature is selected
from the group comprising size, shape, density and texture. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the plurality of other
objects comprises cells, nuclei and artifacts.
A method according to Claim 2, wherein steps (b) to (h) comprise:

(A) using the data processing system to carry out a first stage by:-

(i) measuring a first feature value for each object;
(ii) classifying each object as either normal or abnormal based
on the respective first feature value to identify stage one abnormal objects

and stage one normal objects; and
(iii) counting the number of stage one abnormal objects and the
number of stage one normal objects;
(B) using the data processing system to carry out a second stage
for each stage one abnormal object by:-


(i) measuring a respective second feature value for each of a
plurality of objects neighbouring the stage one abnormal object, wherein

the second feature is object size, shape, texture or density; and
(ii) reclassifying the stage one abnormal object, based on the
second feature value for the neighbouring objects, as either a stage two

normal or abnormal object; and
(iii) counting the number of stage two normal objects and the
number of stage two abnormal objects.
(C) using the data processing system to carry out a third stage
for each stage one abnormal object by:-


(i) measuring a third and fourth feature value for the stage one
abnormal object, wherein the third feature is the total number of other

stage one abnormal objects that neighbour the stage one abnormal object,
and the fourth feature is the total number of objects that neighbour the

stage one abnormal object;
(ii) comparing the third feature value with the fourth feature
value; 
(iii) on the basis of the comparison, reclassifying the stage one
abnormal object as either a stage three normal or abnormal object; and
(iv) counting the number of stage three normal objects and the
number of stage three abnormal objects;
(D) With the data processing system computing an overall rating
for the biomedical image on the basis of a combination of the numbers of

normal and abnormal objects for stage one, two and three; and
(E) With the data processing system, comparing the overall
rating with a predetermined normal value and determining that the

specimen image is normal if the overall rating is less than the
predetermined normal value.
A method according to Claim 8 wherein the first feature is object
size, shape, texture or density.
The method of any preceding claim wherein the objects are
provided by a biological specimen that has been taken from a patient and

mounted on a microscope slide.
The method of Claim 10 wherein the biological specimen comprises
a cervical Pap smear.
