<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a set of parts for use in building, comprising a plurality 
of separate parts which are assemblable to provide a former for defining a 

desired configuration in a set settable material, characterised by at least two 
interengageable surface forming parts (2, 3), and by a thrust part (4) which 

maintains the surface forming parts (2, 3) in an assembled position, and by the 
thrust part (4) being removable to allow the surface forming parts (2, 3) to be 

moved from the set settable material whereby to leave the desired configuration 
(7) in that material (6). 
The invention also extends to a constructional method, and to a building or part 
thereof constructed using the set of parts described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a set of parts for use in building, and a method of using
same.In building construction, it is often necessary to provide desired configurations
in a concrete slab or a concrete wall, for example a cylinder or cylinders which
extend(s) through the slab or the wall to provide a passage for essential services
such as electrical cabling. It is often necessary to disrupt work on the building
whilst such passages are provided, for example by grinding out channels. This
is time consuming and expensive perse, as well as potentially providing
disruption for a building project overall. Examples of prior art devices for
providing these desired configurations can be found in GB-A-395256, GB-A-1109501,
FR-A-2324833 and US-A-1 602 575.It is accordingly an object of the invention to seek to mitigate these
disadvantages.A set of parts for use in building, comprising a plurality of separate parts which
are assemblable to provide a former for defining a desired passage in a set
settable material, like concrete, the separate parts being constituted by interengageable surface
forming parts, and by at least one thrust member which maintains the surface
forming parts in an assembled position, said thrust member being removable to
allow the surface forming parts to be moved from the settable material whereby
to leave the desired passage in that material, characterised in that there are four
surface forming parts, two of which define a curved or angular outer surface
when assembled, in that the first parts of the surface forming parts have
interengaging means for releasable interengagement with complementary 
interengaging means of the second parts of the surface forming parts, in that the second parts are adapted
to engage between facing edges of the assembled first parts, the complementary
interengaging means comprising hook-like parts, and in that the first parts
comprise, adjacent a respective edge, a guide means for the thrust member. The surface forming parts may define a geometric shape such as a circle in
cross-section when assembled.The guide means may each comprise a further hook-like member which may be
in an assembled set directed towards each other and which may terminate spaced
from one another whereby to provide a guide for the thrust member.The thrust member may comprise a cylinder adapted in the assembled set to seat
on the hook-like members of the guide means and on a complementary surface
of each of the other two surface forming parts.The hook-like members of the guide members and

A set of parts for use in building, comprising a plurality of separate parts
(2,3,4) which are assemblable to provide a former for defining a desired passage

(7) in a set settable material (6), like concrete, the separate parts being constituted by
interengageable surface forming parts (2, 3), and by at least one thrust member

(4) which maintains the surface forming parts (2, 3) in an assembled position,
said thrust member (4) being removable to allow the surface forming parts (2,

3) to be moved from the settable material whereby to leave the desired passage
(7) in that material (6), characterised in that there are four surface forming parts

assembled, in that the first parts (2) of the surface forming parts have

interengaging means (13) for releasable interengagement with complementary
lnterengaging means (12) of the second parts (3) of the surface forming parts, in that the second parts (3)

are adapted to engage between facing edges of the assembled first parts (2), the
complementary interengaging means (12, 13) comprising hook-like parts, and in

that the first parts (2) comprise, adjacent a respective edge, a guide means (14)
for the thrust member (4).
A set of parts according to Claim 1, characterised by the surface forming
parts (2, 3), defining a geometric shape in cross-section when assembled.

parts (2, 3) defining a circle in cross-section when assembled.
A set of parts according to any preceding claim , characterised by the
guide means (14) each comprising a further hook-like member which are in an

assembled set directed towards each other and which terminate spaced from one
another whereby to provide a guide for the thrust member. 
A set of parts according to Claim 4, characterised by the thrust member
(4) comprising a cylinder adapted in the assembled set to seat on the hook-like

members (14) of the guide means and on a complementary surface (15, 11) of
each of the other two surface forming parts (2, 3).
A set of parts according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised by the

hook-like members (14) of the guide members and the thrust member having
complementary curved surfaces.

according to Claim 7 at a desired location to provide a desired passage in

settable material (6) used in construction of a building, providing flowable,
settable material used in construction at or round the former, allowing the

material to set, and then dismantling the former (1, 40) from the set
material (6) whereby to provide the desired passage (7) in that material (6).
A method according to Claim 8, characterised by forming a cylindrical
bore in the set settable material (6).
A method according to Claim 8, characterised by forming a groove in
the set settable material (6).
