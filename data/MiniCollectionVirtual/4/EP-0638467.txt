<ABSTRACT>
On a belt retractor for safety belt restraint systems in vehicles, which retractor has an automatic blocking mechanism (26), which is sensitive to the vehicle and the belt, for the belt reel (12) which is rotatably mounted in the casing (10), the head tooth, which first comes into contact with a locking toothing (16) of the belt reel (12), of a locking catch (18) takes the form of a control tooth (181). A control connecting link (22) of the locking catch (18), on which a radial cam (24) of the automatic blocking mechanism (26) engages, has a radial stroke which is such that the locking catch (18) is pivoted by the radial cam (24) until the control tooth (181) first comes into contact with a tooth base of the locking toothing (16) and to a very small extent beyond this point. After initial contact between the control tooth (181) and a tooth base of the control toothing (16), a turning moment is imparted to the locking catch (18) by rotation of the belt reel, by means of which moment the locking catch (18) is made to pivot until the teeth (182, 183) of the catch come into positive engagement with the locking toothing (16).

A belt retractor for vehicular seat belt restraining
systems, having a vehicle-sensitive and belt-sensitive

automatic blocking mechanism (26) for the belt reel (12)
rotatably mounted in the housing (10), on which a ring-shaped

locking toothing (16) is provided, and further having
a locking pawl (18) pivotably mounted on the housing (10)

and having at least two paw] teeth (181, 182, 183) and which

can be swivelled from its rest position to engage the
locking toothing (16) in synchronism with rotation of the

belt reel by means of a cam follower (24) of the automatic
blocking mechanism (26) engaging a control cam (22) of the

locking pawl (18), characterized in that

a) one of the paw] teeth which first comes into contact with

the locking toothing (16) is formed as a control tooth
(181);
b) the control cam (22) has a radial stroke which is
dimensioned so that the locking pawl (18) is swivelled by

the cam follower (24) up to first contact of the control
tooth (181) with a tooth flank of the locking toothing

(16) and insignificantly at the most beyond; and
c) after first contact of the control tooth (181) with a
tooth flank of the locking toothing (16) a torque is

exerted on the locking pawl (18) by rotation of the belt
reel, as a result of which the locking pawl (18) is

forced to swivel up to its blocking position defined by 
positive interlock of the pawl teeth (181, 182, 183) with

the locking toothing (16).
The belt retractor as set forth in claim 1, characterized
in that the prepositioning angle (α) statically established

and defined by the amount of the angle of rotation of the
belt reel (12) for swivelling the locking pawl (18) from its

rest position up to first contact of the control tooth (181)
with a tooth flank of the locking toothing (16) has the same

magnitude as the pitch (β) of the locking toothing (16).
The belt retractor as set forth in claim 2, characterized
in that the statically established prepositioning angle (α)

amounts to between 0.7 and 1.2 times the pitch (β) of the
locking toothing (16).
The belt retractor as set forth in any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the angle (γ) between the

perpendicular to the tooth flank and a line passing through
the location of first contact and the swivel axis of the

locking pawl (18) amounts to at least 30° and preferably
approx. 38° in the region of first contact of the control

tooth (181) with a tooth flank of the locking toothing
(161).
The belt retractor as set forth in claim 4, characterized
in that the control tooth (181) has a leading edge receding

away from the extension of a line passing through its tip
and the centre point of the locking toothing (16).
The belt retractor as set forth in any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the locking pawl (18) has in

addition to the control tooth (181) two further pawl teeth
(182, 183).
The belt retractor as set forth in any of the preceding
claims, in which the control cam comprises a positioning

section (221) at which in the rest position of the locking 
pawl (18) the distance away from the centre point of the

locking toothing (16) increases, and an adjoining runout
section (222) at which said distance away becomes smaller,

characterized in that the positioning section (221) forms an
angle (δ) of approx. 60° with a line passing through the

centre point of the locking toothing (16) and the axis of
the cam follower (24) in the rest position of the locking

pawl (18).
The belt retractor as set forth in claim 7, characterized
in that the extension of the runout section (222) as

measured in the circumferential direction of the locking
toothing (16) is roughly twice as large as that of the

positioning section (221).
