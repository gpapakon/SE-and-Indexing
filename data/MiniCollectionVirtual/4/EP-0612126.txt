<ABSTRACT>
1. An active-mode-locking pulse laser generator comprising: 

an active fibre (1) doped with a fluorescent dopant; 
active-fibre pumping means (5); 
a modulator (14) to be driven from the outside, connected in series 
to said active fibre; 
a wavelength selecting filter (16), to be driven from the outside, 

connected in series to said active fibre; 
means (9) for drawing an emission signal from said active fibre; 
means for defining a laser cavity including the active fibre, 
pumping means, modulator, filter, and signal drawing means, 

wherein the drivable modulator is adapted to generate a modulation of 
the emission signal generated by the active fibre, such as to cause a 

mode-locking of the oscillating emission signal in the cavity, 
wherein the wavelength selecting filter consists of an 

optical-waveguide monolithic filter, in the absence of components 
subjected to spatial-configuration modifications.

<DESCRIPTION>
Under many circumstances in the telecommunications field it is
desirable to obtain pulse laser emissions of a particularly limited
duration.Pulses of the above kind having a duration 6t < 100 ps, commonly
referred to as very short pulses or "solitons" (under guided
propagation conditions), apply in particular to high speed digital
telecommunications (up to 10 GBit/s) and in addition to the
accomplishment of optical instruments, tests on semiconductor
components and also to remote measurements, in topography or in the
atmospheric radar field for example.To this end, mode-locking pulse laser generators are known; by
mode-locking it is meant a process by which, in a laser, several modes
oscillate in a mutual constant-phase relationship, by effect of a
non-linear-behaviour element present in the laser cavity.Mode-locking laser generators of the passive type are known which
comprise optical-fibre laser devices using erbium doped fibres (the
laser shown in Fig. 8, for example) in which a fibre ring containing
an optical amplifier, acts as a saturable absorber, for example to the
wavelength of 1.5 Âµm; pulses generated in these lasers depend on the
laser ring size.Devices of the above kind are described for example in ELECTRONICS
LETTERS, vol. 26, No. 6, March 14, 1991 p. 542-543, by D. J.
Richardson, R. I. Laming, D. N. Payne, V. Matsas, M. W. Phillips, in
ELECTRONICS LETTERS, vol. 27, No. 9, April 25, 1991, p. 730-732, by
the same authors, in ELECTRONICS LETTERS, vol. 27, No. 6, March 14,
1991, p. 544-545, by I. N. Duling and in ELECTRONICS LETTERS, vol. 27,
No. 3, January 31, 1991, p. 229-230, by G. J. Cowle and D. N. Payne.Optical-fibre laser devices are also known in which an active
modulation device of the electro-optical type is inserted in an 
optical path forming a laser cavity so as to force the laser to
generate mode-locking pulses at the desired frequency.Such devices are referred to as active mode-locking devices because
the modulation device present therein operated from the outside acts
on the modes generated in the laser, enabling amplification up to a
level keeping the laser emission to the only modes selected by the
applied modulation.Devices of the above type are described for example in OPTICS LETTERS,
vol. 14, No. 22, November 15, 1989, p. 1269-1271, by J.D. Kafta, T.
