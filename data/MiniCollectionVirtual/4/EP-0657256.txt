<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for scoring plastic tamper 
indicating closures to provide the tamper indicating band that 

is connected to the closure by bridges formed by scoring. The 
scoring is achieved by successively moving a rotating closure 

past a stationary primary knife blade (33) having an arcuate concave 
interrupted cutting edge to form the bridges and then past a 

secondary knife (34) blade having an arcuate concave uninterrupted 
cutting edge to accurately dimension the bridges. The method 

and apparatus provides for supporting each knife blade (33,34) on a 
holder (40) wherein the position of the blade 

can be set by setting 
the blade (33,34) into a knife blade holder (40) using a setting fixture 

(60) remote from the apparatus, clamping the blade (33,34) 
within the knife 

blade holder (40), transferring the knife holder (40) 
to a machine mounting 

on the apparatus, then attaching the knife holder to the machine 
mounting without further adjustment, such that the arcuate knife 

blade is aligned with the center of the radius of the arc of 
each arcuate knife blade lies on a radial line from the curvature 

of the cutting edge to the center of the apparatus Each knife 
blade holder (40) is preferably mounted on a slide (41) on the rotary 

apparatus such that the arcuate edge can be adjusted so that 
the concave arc is parallel to the path of travel of the mandrels 

and at the required depth from the successive scoring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing and
to an apparatus for forming a circumferential score in a
plastic closure according to the preambles of claims 1 and
6, respectively. Such scores are used to define a tamper
indicating band on the closure connected to the peripheral
skirt by a plurality of bridges. The bridges are broken when
the closure is removed from a container.CA-A-1,161,611 shows scoring of bottle caps by
conveying the caps with a turret along an arcuate knife. The
knife is clamped in a knife holder which can be adjusted by
adjusting means formed by a threaded rod with a knob
thereon.One type of tamper indicating closure includes molded
circumferentially spaced bridges in order to define a tamper
indicating band on the closure. Such construction requires
costly more complex molds which also require maintenance.
Typical patents showing such tamper indicating closures
comprise US-A-4,613,052, 4,721,218, 4,801,031, 5,090,246 and
5,090,788.Another type of tamper indicating closure comprises
utilizing an interrupted edged knife to produce bridges such
as shown in US-A-4,322,009. In another type of tamper indicating closure,
circumferentially spaced axial bridges are provided on the
internal surface of the skirt of the closure and a
continuous straight edged knife is applied from the exterior
surface cutting through the wall of the closure and into the
bridges. Such a construction also requires costly complex
molds that require maintenance and necessitates relatively
thin walls on the closures. A typical patent showing such a
construction comprises US-A-4,545,496.In EP-A-0 621 475 A1 a tamper indicating closure is
shown which comprises a base wall and a peripheral skirt
having an internal thread adapted to engage the threads of a
container wherein a tamper indicating band is provided on
the skirt by a plurality of circumferentially spaced
bridges. The band includes portions adapted to engage an
annular bead on the container. The bridges are formed by
using a primary knife having an interrupted cutting edge to
produce a circumferential score in the side wall of the
closure leaving spaced connectors or bridges. A secondary
knife is used having a continuous uninterrupted cutting edge
to provide a continuous external score line to provide an
accurately dimensional radial thickness of the bridges. In a
preferred method and apparatus, the closures engage the
successive primary and secondary knives and are moved such
that the closures roll relative to the knives.In such apparatus, each arcuate
