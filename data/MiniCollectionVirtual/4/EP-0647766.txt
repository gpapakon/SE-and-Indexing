<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for performing multiple operations on a 
well in response to multiple fluid pressure increases has 

first (1012) and second (1006) pressure actuated firing 
heads and a source of actuating fluid pressure for the 

firing heads. A first selective communication device (1010) 
is provided for isolating the second firing head (1006) from 

the source of actuating fluid pressure until after the first 
firing head (1012) has been actuated and for then 

communicating the second firing head (1006) with the source 
of actuating fluid pressure in response to actuation of the 

first firing head (1012). The apparatus includes a well 
tool which is actuated by the second firing head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid pressure
actuated apparatus for performing multiple well operations.During the completion of an oil or gas well, a
length of casing is cemented in a borehole, and then one or
more zones of the casing are perforated to communicate the
bore of the casing with subsurface geological formations
intersected by the borehole so that oil or gas from that
subsurface formation may be produced by the well.One well-known type of perforating system is a
tubing conveyed perforating system wherein the perforating
guns and related apparatus are carried by a tubing string
made up of a plurality of threaded joints of tubing or pipe
which are connected together and lowered into the well.
These tubing conveyed completion systems may be run in
combination with a drill stem test string so that the well
can be perforated and tested in a single trip.In some situations, it is desirable to be able to
selectively perforate more than one zone of the well at
different times. The prior art has typically addressed this
need by the provision of multiple firing heads which are
constructed to actuate at different operating pressures.
With these systems, the selection of the appropriate firing
head and gun to be fired is determined by the pressure which
is applied to the tubing string or the well annulus to
actuate the firing head. Systems of this type capable of
firing several perforating guns independently during one 
trip into the well can be constructed utilizing the Time
Delayed Firing Head available from Vann Systems of
Carrollton, Texas. The Vann Time Delayed Firing Head
utilizes a set of shear pins the number of which can be
selected to determine the actuating pressure of each firing
head.We have now devised an apparatus including a
downhole tool such as a perforating gun, whereby the
apparatus can be used for one or more well operations prior
to actuation of the tool.The invention provides apparatus comprising at
least first and second pressure actuated firing heads, a
source of actuating fluid pressure for the heads, a first
selective communication means for isolating said second
firing head from said source of actuating fluid pressure
until after said first firing head has been actuated, and
for then communicating said second firing head with said
source of actuating fluid pressure in response to actuation
of said first firing head,
wherein the said first selective communication
means is actuated directly by actuation of the first firing
head to communicate the second firing head with the
