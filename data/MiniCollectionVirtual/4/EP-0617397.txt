<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display apparatus includes an LCD 
having a plurality (N) of row electrodes and a plurality 

(M) of column electrodes which intersect to each other 
orthogonally. A plurality (n) of row electrodes of the 

plurality (N) of row electrodes are individually and 
simultaneously driven by a plurality (n) of row drivers 

with voltages which are determined according to Walsh 
functions. A VGA controller which receives a video 

signal outputs display data of one frame. A plurality 
(n) of storages individually store the display data of 

each of n rows which are simultaneously driven. The 
display data from respective storages are applied to a 

plurality (m) of calculation circuits. Respective 
calculation circuits calculate driving voltage values for 

respective column electrodes in accordance with the Walsh 
function and the display data so as to apply the same to 

a plurality (m) of column drivers, respectively. 
Respective column drivers drive the column electrodes 

included in each of a plurality (m) column electrode 
groups with the driving voltage values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal 
display apparatus. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to a liquid crystal display apparatus 
according to an improved simple matrix drive system 
(hereinafter, called as "new simple matrix drive system") 
wherein a plurality of row are simultaneously scanned or 
driven. In a conventional simple matrix drive system, 
respective row lines or electrodes of an LCD (liquid 
crystal display) are driven in a time-division manner. 
Therefore, in the conventional simple matrix drive 
system, when the number of time-division, i.e. the number 
of rows is large, a lag of response, a drop of contrast, 
and a ghost become problems. In order to solve disadvantages of the conventional 
simple matrix drive system, a novel drive system called 
as a new simple matrix drive system has been proposed in, 
for example, United States Patent Application serial No. 
⊘7/678,736 which was filed on April 1, 1991 (This is  
 
corresponding to Japanese Patent Laying-Open Gazette No. 
5-1⊘⊘642 laid open on April 23, 1993). In the new simple 
matrix drive system, in order to implement a high-contrast 
by utilizing a orthonormal matrix, an optimum 
on/off ratio of a voltage is obtained in accordance with 
a proper function such as Walsh function. In such the new simple matrix drive system, since 
the voltages of pixels must be calculated at every one 
frame, it is necessary to utilize a dedicated 
microcomputer or DSP (digital signal processor). In a 
case of a large-sized LCD, that is, in a case where the 
number of pixels is large, a microcomputer or DSP having 
a rapid calculation speed is to be utilized, and 
therefore, a liquid crystal display apparatus becomes 
expensive. Therefore, a principal object of the present 
invention is to provide a novel liquid crystal display 
apparatus according to the new simple matrix driver 
system. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a cheap liquid crystal display apparatus 
according to the new simple matrix drive system. Another object of the present invention is to  
 
provide a liquid crystal display apparatus according to 
the new simple matrix drive system, in which a rapid 
calculation speed is not required. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a liquid crystal display apparatus according to 
the new simple matrix drive system, with a good display 
quality. A liquid crystal display apparatus according to the 
present invention utilizes an LCD having a plurality (N) 
of row electrodes and a
