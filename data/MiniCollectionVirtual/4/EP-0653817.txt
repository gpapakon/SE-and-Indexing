<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (1), comprises; an insulating 
housing (2), a contact receiving cavity (3) in the 

housing (2), and an electrical contact (4) in a first cavity 
portion (5) of the cavity (3) for connection to a mating 

electrical contact (7) of another, mating electrical 
connector (8). A contact portion (15) of the contact (4) 

extends along the cavity (3), a tip (17) of the 
contact portion (15) is received in a first channel (24) of 

the cavity (3), and the contact portion (15) projects 
into a second cavity portion (6) of the cavity (3), the 

second cavity portion (6) being open along two 
intersecting sides (9,10) of the housing (2) for 

connection to the mating electrical contact (7) of 
the other mating electrical connector (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical connector
for a package that is accessible along two intersecting sides
for receiving a mating electrical contact of another, mating
electrical connector.For example, an electrical connector for a package is
disclosed in EP-A-0 617 486 wherein the package is suitable
for containing an electrical device in the form of battery
cells. The battery cells are merely exemplary of electrical
devices of many varieties and kinds that could be contained
int he package, and that utilize terminals protected by the
package. An electrical connector for a package includes one
or more electrical contacts that are accessible through an end
and a side of an insulating package, with the package
protecting the contacts. The package is adaptable for
containing various kinds of electrical devices that utilize
the contacts for electrical connection to another, mating
electrical connector, such as a header mounted to a circuit
board.According to GB-A-2 280 995 an electrical connector for
a package is adapted for upside down, or top side up, mating
connection with another, mating electrical connector.The documents EP-A-0 617 486 and GB-A-2 280 995
have both been published after the priority date of the
present invention.US-A-4 457 570 discloses a modular jack for directly
coupling a printed circuit board and a standard, miniature,
telephone-style modular plug. The jack housing includes a
cavity open along two intersecting sides at the front portion
thereof for receiving the modular plug. It includes
conductors having spring contact portions that extend
diagonally forwardly of the cavity from the rear part of the
cavity to be engaged with the similarly spaced contact
terminals of the modular plug. The forward ends of the
contact portions are received in channels in the cavity whilst
the other ends of the jack's conductors extend normally from
the rear wall of the housing to fit within correspondingly
spaced apertures in the printed circuit board. EP-A2-0 353 421 describes an edge design for a printed
circuit board having spring biassed contact members mounted
in a first portion of a contact receiving cavity and having
a contact portion extending into a second portion of the
cavity for engaging contact tabs of a circuit board inserted
into the cavity. The tips of the contact portions are engaged
in a channel extending along the front of the cavity.The present invention consists in an electrical connector
comprising an insulating housing having one or more contact
receiving cavities,

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (2) comprising an insulating
housing (2) having one or more contact receiving cavities (3),

an electrical contact (4) disposed in the or each cavity (3) for
electrical connection to a mating electrical contact (7), the or

each cavity being open along two intersecting sides (9,10) of
the housing so as to receive the mating electrical contact in

the cavity and also having an opening along a third side (23)
through which the contact (4) is inserted into the cavity upon

assembly, the or each contact having a cantilever contact
portion (15) which extends diagonally and forwardly within the

cavity towards the two open intersecting sides and which has a
tip (17) received in a channel (24) in the cavity, wherein

the or each cavity (3) comprises first and second cavity
portions (5,6), the associated contact (4) is disposed in the

first cavity portion (5) with its contact portion (15) extending
into the second cavity portion (6), and the channel (24)

receiving the tip (17) of the contact portion extends forwardly
in the first cavity portion (5) from the opening in the third

side (23).
An electrical connector as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
or each electrical contact (4) comprises a blade (11) having its

contact portion (15) extending diagonally therefrom, said blade
being mounted in the associated first cavity portion (5).
An electrical connector as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
blade is mounted in the associated first cavity portion with

opposite edges engaged in the channel (24) and an opposed
channel (25) of the first cavity portion (5) also extending

forwardly from the opening in the third side (23) of the housing
(2).
An electrical connector as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein the first cavity portion (5) of the or each cavity (3)

extends forwardly from the opening in the third side (23), and
the second cavity portion (6) is open along the two intersecting

sides (9,10) for receiving the mating electrical contact into
the second cavity portion.
