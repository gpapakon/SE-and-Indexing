<ABSTRACT>
Safety management system for protecting the occupants of vehicles, such as restraining devices, containing a system for measuring distances from objects on or by the road, a vehicle-internal acceleration measurement system, a bus connection to other vehicle measurement systems and a central (vehicle-mounted) computer unit (CPU), the distance data and acceleration data and the operating status data from the vehicle being processed and logically connected in the computer unit in order to successively perform measures such as warnings and/or interventions into the braking and steering system, depending on the hazard situation, in such a way that accidents can be avoided or their effects can be reduced.

<CLAIMS>
Safety management system for triggering restraint devices
(109, 110, 111) consisting of:


a system (101) for measuring the distance to objects in or
on the road,
a device for capturing data relevant to the volume of
traffic,
an acceleration measuring system (102) internal to the
vehicle,
a bus connection (105) to other measuring systems of the
vehicle and
a central (on-board) computer unit (CPU) (103),

wherein this system determines the impact speed prior to a
crash with the help of the distance measuring system (101)

and passes this value to the computer unit (103) and wherein
this value is also used via the bus connection (105) in the

activating process for the restraint system (109, 110, 111)
which is triggered by the acceleration measuring system

(102) internal to the vehicle, characterised in that this
system also automatically triggers emergency braking or is

effective on the brakes for preventing or softening the
impact.
Safety management system for triggering restraint devices
(109, 110, 111) consisting of:


a system (101) for measuring the distance to objects in or
on the road,
a device for capturing data relevant to the volume of
traffic,
an acceleration measuring system (102) internal to the
vehicle,
a bus connection (105) to other measuring systems of the
vehicle and
a central (on-board) computer unit (CPU) (103),

wherein this system determines the impact speed prior to a
crash with the help of the distance measuring system (101) 

and passes this value to the computer unit (103) and wherein
this value is also used via the bus connection (105) in the

activating process for the restraint system (109, 110, 111)
which is triggered by the acceleration measuring system

(102) internal to the vehicle, characterised in that this
system also automatically effects emergency throttling down

of the engine for preventing or softening the impact.
Safety management system for triggering restraint devices
(109, 110, 111) consisting of:


a system (101) for measuring the distance to objects in or
on the road,
a device for capturing data relevant to the volume of
traffic,
an acceleration measuring system (102) internal to the
vehicle,
a bus connection (105) to other measuring systems of the
vehicle and
a central (on-board) computer unit (CPU) (103),

wherein this system determines the impact speed prior to a
crash with the help of the distance measuring system (101)

and passes this value to the computer unit (103) and wherein
this value is also used via the bus connection (105) in the

activating process for the restraint system (109, 110, 111)
which is triggered by the acceleration measuring system

(102) internal to the vehicle, characterised in that this
system also automatically triggers emergency steering or is

effective on the steering system for preventing or softening
the impact.
Safety management system in accordance with any of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the distance

measuring system (101) or the device for capturing data
relevant to the volume of traffic (101) [sic]
, or, the whole
of the safety management system is mounted in the roof

region or in the vicinity of the rear view mirror of the
vehicle.
