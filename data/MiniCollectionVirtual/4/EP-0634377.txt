<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of producing shaped bodies having heat insulating properties and based on foamed alkali metal silicate particles containing silicon dioxide (SiO2) and alkali metal oxide (M2O) (M is an alkali metal) in a molar ratio of from 2 to 4.5 (SiO2:M2O), and is characterised in that 100 parts by weight of the foamed alkali metal silicate particles are mixed with an aqueous solution of monoaluminium phosphate (Al(H2PO4)3), so that the molar ratio Si:Al in the mixture assumes a value of from 1 to 60, the mixture is charged into a preselected mould and is compacted to from 20 to 80% of the original volume to give a shaped body, and the shaped body is heated to a temperature of from 100 to 500 DEG C until a chemical reaction bonding between the alkali metal silicate particles and the monoaluminium phosphate has taken place. The invention further relates to the use of such shaped bodies as heat-insulating and sound-insulating material.

Process for producing shaped bodies having thermally 
insulating properties and based on foamed alkali 

metal silicate particles comprising silicon dioxide 
(SiO₂) and alkali metal oxide (M₂O) (M is an alkali metal) 

in a molar ratio of from 2 to 4.5 (SiO₂:M₂O), 
characterized in that 


a) 100 parts by weight of the foamed alkali metal 
silicate particles are mixed with an aqueous solution of 

monoaluminium phosphate (Al(H₂PO₄)₃) in such a way that 
the molar ratio Si:Al in the mixture assumes a value of 

from 1 to 60; 
b) the mixture is placed in a preselected mould 
and the mixture is compacted to from 20 to 80% of the 

original volume to give a shaped body; 
c) the shaped body is heated to a temperature of 
from 100 to 500°C until a chemical reaction bond between 

the alkali metal silicate particles and the monoaluminium 
phosphate has taken place. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the monoaluminium phosphate content of the aqueous 

solution is from 5 to 60% by weight. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that, prior to mixing in accordance with 

step a) of the process, from 0 to 30 parts by weight 
(based on the amount of the alkali metal silicate particles) 

of an inorganic opacifier are suspended in the 
aqueous monoaluminium phosphate solution. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, in step a) of the process, the 

aqueous monoaluminium phosphate solution is sprayed onto 
the alkali metal silicate particles. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that, in step b) of the process, the 

moulds selected are ones for moulding plates, profiles or 
pipes. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the shaped body is mechanically 

processed, has paper or films adhesively bonded to it, is  
 

provided with a closed coating, or is packed in a 
gastight, evacuated covering. 
Shaped body produced in a process according to 
any one of Claims 1 to 6 used for thermal insulation. 
Shaped body produced in a process according to 
any one of Claims 1 to 6 used for sound insulation.
