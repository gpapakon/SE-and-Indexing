<ABSTRACT>
In the video signal recording apparatus of the 
present invention, when recording video signals of a 

plurality of frames after highly efficiently coding the 
same, video signals of the first frame are coded within the 

frame and divided into compression blocks each of which 
block is recorded to a corresponding recording block at a 

fixed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video signal recording
apparatus for use in recording or transmitting video
signals after processing the same with high efficiency,
that is, processing through the bit rate reduction.The aforementioned bit rate reduction has been
known as one way to reduce the amount of data of video
signals. The bit rate reduction eliminates the redundancy
of video signals thereby to reduce the amount of data.In order to execute the bit rate reduction,
adjacent pixels are gathered into the configuration of a
block and compressed through the orthogonal transformation.
The block subjected to the above orthogonal transformation
is called as an orthogonal transformation block. After the
orthogonal transformation, the data is variable-length
coded to improve the compression efficiency before being
recorded or transmitted.Meanwhile, in effecting the bit rate reduction
for moving images, it is one practice currently performed
to improve the compression rate with using the correlation
of frames, i.e., to code only the differential value
between the adjacent frames, and a so-called motion 
compensation is effective to obtain the above differential
value. The amount of data of differential signals between
the frames is reduced by detecting a motion between the
adjacent frames and compensating one of the frames by the
motion compensation. Therefore, when moving images are to
be coded highly efficiently, the data subsequent to the
motion compensation is generally processed through the
orthogonal transformation.Since the above-described arrangement uses
variable-length coding, however, it accompanies a
disadvantageous problem that the variable-length coded data
may not be decoded in case of occurrence of errors at the
regenerating time. On the other hand, in a different
method, an address data is added and recorded to show for
every predetermined period of recording data which of the
orthogonal transformation blocks the subject data is
related to. Even if the coding synchronization of the
variable-length coding is lost due to an error of the
transmission line, this method makes it possible to remedy
the coding synchronization with the help of additional data
such as address data, pointers, etc. having a set number of
blocks recorded as one unit. However, the compression
efficiency for the bit rate reduction is deteriorated
because of the necessity to record the additional data. It
is therefore highly required to trim the redundancy of the 
additional data before recording.When the data is to be
