like having at least a central part of the hull made like a 

rigid shell (1, 1') and being combined with hollow 
peripheral floating elements (2, 2', 22). According to the 

invention, the peripheral floating elements (2; 2', 22) are 
secured to a central shell-like rigid part (1, 1') of the 

hull, in a overturning way, alternatively in a active 
floating position, in which they are placed outside over the 

rigid part of the hull (1, 1') and in a storage or transport 
position in which said floating elements (2', 22) are placed 

inside the rigid part (1, 1') of the hull.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a boat, particularly to a 
service-boat for crafts, ships, or the like, having at least 
a central part of the hull made like a rigid shell and at 
least two peripheral floating elements. For the pleasure-crafts there is the need of using small 
service-boats for moving to land or other kinds of services. 
Actually boats are used which are known under the name of 
rubber boats. In their actual construction, however, these 
rubber boats are bulky and during the navigation they are 
transported being susepended over the stern by means of 
small cranes or being towed. Exspecially in the case of 
sailing boats, particularly in the middle-sized boats, where 
for dimensional reasons there is not the possibility to 
provide cranes astern, the transport of this service-boats 
is particularly affected with problems. Also the towing of 
the service boats, besides being uncomfortable, is notably 
affected with problems. The dimensional problems are considerable also in using 
such boats as proper pleasure boats, which are pullable on 
roads with a trailer. In fact, there are limitations of the 
allowed maximum width for the transport on a trailer (for 
example 2500 mm). In this case, for boats like the so called 
rubber boats, and when these boats have notable dimensions,  
 
it is necessary to resort to trickery, like for example the 
deflation of the peripheral floating bodies during the 
transport. With the boat according to the invention it is aimed to 
obviate in a simple and economic way to the above mentioned 
problems, in making the boat less bulky and heavy and 
solving widly the problems of transport. In consequence, the invention provides a boat of the 
above mentioned kind, having peripheral floating elements 
which are secured to the central rigid part of the hull in 
an overturning way, alternatively in an active position, in 
which they are placed outside over the rigid part of the 
hull and in a storage or transport position, in which the 
said floating elements are placed inside the said central, 
rigid part of the hull. The floating elements can be locked in the active 
position by means of any releaseable means. As floating elements it is preferably to use floating 
bodies formed by substantially cylindrical, inflatable 
chambers of rubberized canvas. Preferably two floating elements are provided, which are 
hinged along one longitudinal edge, at the respective 
broadside of the central rigid part of the hull, preferably 
at least along a straight section of it. The
