<ABSTRACT>
In the transmission of digital television signals using the COFDM method, the individual carrier frequencies used therein are phase-modulated. A phase reference signal is transmitted in each transmission frame in order to demodulate the individual carrier frequencies in the receiver. The phase difference between the phase reference signal and the individual carrier frequencies received in the same transmission frame contains the transmitted information. A problem lies in the phase and amplitude distortion of the individual carrier frequencies which can be caused by transmitter and receiver modules and by the transmission path. The novel method enables correction of these distortions, insofar as a mathematical model can be indicated therefor. To correct the phase of the received individual carrier frequencies, a mathematical model is built for the phase distortions of the phase reference signals dependent on time. The data signals received between two phase reference signals are corrected on the basis of this mathematical model of the temporal pattern of the reference phase. In order to eliminate additional random phase distortions, a maximum likelihood decision is made with the corrected phase value. The amplitude of the individual carrier frequencies is corrected using a standard amplitude value which is derived from the amplitudes of previously received individual carrier frequencies. The novel method enables the correction of phase-modulated individual carrier frequencies and can be used in transmissions based on the COFDM method.

Method of correcting phase and amplitude of a
broadband incoming signal with the aid of reference

signals (REF) transmitted with an incoming signal,
wherein a correction characteristic curve is

calculated by a control unit (MP) on the basis of the
transfer function, determined in a known manner, of

participating assemblies and/or transmission paths,
and the short-term spectrum (SP) of the incoming

signal is weighted with the correction characteristic
curve, wherein the amplitude of the incoming signal is

corrected on the basis of a comparison between the
incoming-signal amplitude and a stored amplitude,


characterized in that
 the amplitude and phase
correction of the incoming signal by the correction

characteristic curve is calculated on the basis of the
amplitude difference and phase difference of at least

two reference signals (REF) that have a reference
phase (PR) and a reference amplitude by interpolating

the correction characteristic curve from the time-dependent
change in the reference signal (REF) and/or

by interpolating the correction characteristic curve
from the frequency-dependent change in the reference

signal (REF) and by performing, after the correction,
a maximum-likelihood decision in regard to the

corrected phases and amplitudes.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

signals that have a reference phase (PR) and/or
reference amplitude or the reference phase (PR) and/or

reference amplitude themselves are stored and 
in that
,
to calculate the phase correction (Pfi) and the 

amplitude correction, stored reference phases (PR) and
reference amplitudes are also used.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the incoming signal is corrected by a complex
multiplication of the correction characteristic curve

by the short-term spectrum (SP) of the incoming
signal.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the correction is performed at a
point in the signal path at which the short-term

spectrum (SP) of the incoming signal is already

available.
Use of a method according to one or more of Claims 1
to 4 in the transmission of digital television data.
Circuit arrangement for performing the method
according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,


characterized in that
 a control unit (MP) is disposed
downstream of a Fourier transformer (FFT) in the

signal path and 
in that
 said control unit (MP) is
connected to a memory (SPE) into which reception data

(SP) and characteristic curve data are written and 
in
that
 the control unit (MP) is connected to a
demodulator (DMOD).
