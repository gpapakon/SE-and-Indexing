<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of the detection and treatment of genetic
diseases. Specifically, the invention is directed to the huntingtin gene (also
called the IT15 gene), huntingtin protein encoded by such gene, and the use
of this gene and protein in assays (1) for the detection of a predisposition to
develop Huntington's disease, (2) for the diagnosis of Huntington's disease
(3) for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and (4) for monitoring the
course of treatment of such treatment.Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by motor disturbance, cognitive loss and psychiatric
manifestations (Martin and Gusella, N. Engl. J. Med. 315:1267-1276 (1986).
It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and affects about 1/10,000
individuals in most populations of European origin (Harper, P.S. et al., in
Huntington's disease, W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1991). The hallmark of 
HD is a distinctive choreic movement disorder that typically has a subtle,
insidious onset in the fourth to fifth decade of life and gradually worsens over
a course of 10 to 20 years until death. Occasionally, HD is expressed in
juveniles typically manifesting with more severe symptoms including rigidity
and a more rapid course. Juvenile onset of HD is associated with a
preponderance of paternal transmission of the disease allele. The
neuropathology of HD also displays a distinctive pattern, with selective loss
of neurons that is most severe in the caudate and putamen regions of the brain.
The biochemical basis for neuronal death in HD has not yet been explained,
and there is consequently no treatment effective in delaying or preventing the
onset and progression of this devastating disorder.The genetic defect causing HD was assigned to chromosome 4 in 1983
in one of the first successes of linkage analysis using polymorphic DNA
markers in man (Gusella et al., Nature 306:234-238 (1983). Since that time,
we have pursued a location cloning approach to isolating and characterizing
the HD gene based on progressively refining its localization (Gusella,
FASEB J. 3:2036-2041 (1989); Gusella, Adv. Hum. Genet. 20:125-151
(1991)). Among other work, this has involved the generation of new genetic
markers in the region by a number of techniques (Pohl et al., Nucleic Acids
Res. 16:9185-9198 (1988); Whaley et al., Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 17:83-91
(1991); MacDonald et al., J. Clin. Inv. 84:1013-1016 (1989)), the
establishment of genetic (MacDonald et al., Neuron 3:183-190(1989); Allitto
et al.,
