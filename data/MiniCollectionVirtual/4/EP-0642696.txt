<ABSTRACT>
A traffic accident detecting sensor for a passenger protection system in a vehicle with a low-retentivity seismic mass (2) which can move along a guide (5) between two extreme positions and is normally held in a first extreme position by a pressure. The pressure is overcome in the event of deceleration in such a way that the seismic mass moves into the second extreme position, with a magnet (4) distinct from the seismic mass, the magnetic field of which is differentially distorted by the seismic mass depending upon the latter's position, with at least one contact (1) controllable by the field of the magnet and with such an arrangement of the contact and the seismic mass that, in its first extreme position, the latter largely represents a magnetic shunt diverting the magnetic field away from the contact and towards the seismic mass so that the contact is then in its first contact condition and the seismic mass does not represent a magnetic shunt at points beyond this extreme position so that the contact is then controlled in its other contact condition under the effect of the magnetic field. The magnet forms the guide or is rigidly connected thereto, the magnet being magnetised perpendicularly to the direction in which the seismic mass can move. The contact is arranged near a frontal surface of the guide in such a way that the magnetic flux through the contact depends upon the position of the seismic mass.

Traffic accident detecting sensor for a passenger 
protection system in a vehicle, 


having a low-retentivity seismic mass (2), 

which can be moved between two extreme positions 
along a guide axis of a guide member (5) that 

guides the seismic mass (2), 
and which is normally pressed by a contact pressure 
into a first extreme position, said contact 

pressure yielding or being overcome in the event 
of an acceleration or deceleration acting more or 

less in the direction of the guide axis so that 
the seismic mass (2) then moves toward a second 

extreme position, 
having a magnet (4) distinct from the seismic mass 
(2), the magnetic field of which magnet is deformed 

to a varying degree by the seismic mass (2) depending 
on the position thereof, 
having at least one contact (1) that can be controlled 
by the magnetic field of the magnet (4), the 

magnetic flux through the contact(s) (1) being 
clearly dependent on the position of the seismic 

mass (2), and 
having such an arrangement of the contact(s) (1) and 
the seismic mass (2) that in a first of its two 

extreme positions the latter constitutes a strong 
magnetic shunt to a large extent diverting the 

magnetic field away from the contact (1) toward the 
seismic mass (2), so 


that, despite the presence of the magnetic field,  
 

the contact(s) (1) is (are) then in its (their) 
first contact state as long as the seismic mass 

(2) remains in said extreme position, and 
that, at points distant from said extreme position, 
the seismic mass (2) does not constitute a 

magnetic shunt, or no longer constitutes one that 
is effective to the same extent, so that the contact(s) 

(1) is(are) then controlled in its (their) 
other contact state under the effect of the 

magnetic field, 
 
characterized 
in that the magnet (4) forms the guide member (5) or 
is rigidly connected to the guide member (5), 
in that the magnet (4) is magnetized more or less 
perpendicularly to the direction in which the seismic 

mass (2) can move, and 
in that the contact(s) (1) is(are) arranged more or 
less near a frontal face of the guide member (5). 
Sensor according to Patent Claim 1, characterized 
in that 


locally the strength of magnetization of the guide 
member (5) along the direction of movement of the 

seismic mass (2) is selected so that during the 
movement of the seismic mass (2) from its second 

extreme position to its first one 

the magnetic field component flowing through the 
seismic mass (2) constantly increases, 
and the magnetic flux flowing through the contact(s) 
(1) constantly decreases. 
Sensor according to Patent Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that 


locally the strength of magnetization of the guide 
member (5) along the direction of movement of the 

seismic mass (2) is selected so that during movement 
of the seismic mass (2) along the guide member (5), 

the magnetic field component flowing through the 
seismic mass (2) in each case has a sudden change in 

strength at a point between the extreme positions of  
 

the seismic mass (2). 
Sensor according to Patent Claim 3, characterized 

in that 

the sudden change in strength is caused by such a 
geometric design of the guide member (5) that the 

magnetic flux (B, B1, B11, B12) through the contact(s) 
(1) changes suddenly as soon as the seismic 

mass (2) moves past said point. 
Sensor according to one of the preceding patent 
claims, characterized in that 


the contact pressure (F) is generated at least 
largely by the magnetic flux flowing through the 

seismic mass (2). 
Sensor according to one of the preceding patent 
claims, characterized in that 


the seismic mass (2) is made at least partially of 
electrically conductive material.
