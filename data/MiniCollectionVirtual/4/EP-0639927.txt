<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for recording, processing and reproducing
digital video signals in the form of coded signals. More particularly, but not
exclusively, the invention relates to recording, reproducing and searching for coded
signals having a predefined format that represent moving pictures and still pictures.In a conventional video recording and reproducing apparatus, such as a video
cassette recorder (VCR) or a camcorder, video signals representing moving pictures
are recorded on a tape for subsequent reproduction. To advance or reverse the tape
so that reproduction of the moving pictures begins from a desired position, the tape
is searched or cued for an INDEX ID, a five second signal recorded at the desired
position. As an example, Fig. 1 shows a portion of a video tape representing the end
of a Program 1 and the beginning of a Program 2. An INDEX ID is recorded at the
beginning of Program 2 for high speed cuing. To begin reproduction at the beginning
of Program 2, the conventional video recording apparatus first searches for this
INDEX ID and, upon finding the INDEX ID, begins reproduction.The conventional cuing method has the drawback that it is only effective when
cuing a desired position in a series of moving pictures recorded for a time greater than
the five second 
INDEX ID interval. In a camcorder in which still pictures as
well as moving pictures are recorded, the still pictures are
recorded for a time much shorter than the five second INDEX ID
interval, and the conventional cuing method cannot be used to
search for a recorded still picture.A further drawback of the above-described conventional
cuing method is that searches for a desired position on a tape
using information other than the INDEX ID symbol, such as
recording time and date or recording content, are also desired.European patent serial number EP 0 548 887 A discloses
an apparatus for recording video signals in digital form in
accordance with a recording format which includes a video signal
recording area for recording video information and for recording
accompanying video signals, and a subcode signal recording area
for recording subcode information. The apparatus is provided
with a generating means for generating the accompanying video
signals and the subcode signals, a framing means and a combining
means to arrange the video signals, the accompanying video
signals and the subcode signals into a predetermined pattern.EP-A-0 488 373 describes a magnetic tape recording/reproducing apparatus and mentions
