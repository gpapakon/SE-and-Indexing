<ABSTRACT>
A modified polyphenylene ether comprising constitutional units represented by general formula (1) and having the number-average 
degree of polymerization of 20 to 1,200, wherein 0.02/x to 1/x of the methyl groups at the 2- and/or 6-positions of 

the phenylene groups are substituted by aminomethyl groups. In formula (1), R₁ and R₂ represent each independently hydrogen 
or C₁-C₂₀ hydrocarby
l; a process for the production thereof; and a thermoplastic resin composition comprising (A) 1-75 
wt.% of the above ether and (B) 99-25 wt.% of a liquid-crystal polyester. Since the above ether contains reactive primary amino 

groups in the side chains thereof, it is desirable for widened uses such as the components of various compositions and 
polymer alloys. The above resin composition is excellent in heat resistance, mechanical properties, appearance and luster.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel modified polyphenylene 
ether comprising repeating units in which a methyl group 
at 2- and/or 6-position of a phenylene group in the polyphenylene 
ether is substituted with an aminomethyl group, and a process for 
preparing the same. The present invention also relates to a novel thermoplastic 
resin composition which can be used, for example, in the 
production of a molded article by injection molding or extrusion 
molding. In general, a polyphenylene ether is a resin having various 
good properties such as heat resistance, hot water resistance, dimensional 
stability and mechanical and electrical properties, while it 
has some drawbacks that its molding property is not good because of 
its high melt viscosity, its chemical resistance is not good and its 
impact resistance is low. To improve such drawbacks of the 
polyphenylene ether, it has alloyed with other resin or modified. For example, Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 
897/1977 discloses a process for modifying a polyphenylene ether 
using an aliphatic secondary amine as one component of a 
polymerization catalyst. Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 
68024/1992 discloses a process for preparing a polyphenylene ether 
having a terminal secondary amino group comprising reacting a  
 
polyfunctional isocyanate with the polyphenylene ether, and Japanese 
Patent KOKAI Publication No. 313523/1989 discloses a process for 
preparing a polyphenylene ether having a terminal functional group 
containing a secondary or tertiary amino group. Japanese Patent 
KOKAI Publication No. 297428/1989 discloses a polyphenylene ether 
copolymer having an alkyl-substituted tertiary amine on a methylene 
group at the 2-position. Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 
234421/1989 relates to a polyphenylene ether copolymer having a 
partly aryl-substituted tertiary amine on a side methylene group at 
the 2-position. Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 503464/1988 
relates to a polyphenylene ether having a polyalkylene dicarboxylate. 
Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 37365/1990 discloses a 
polyphenylene ether having a primary amino group on a propylene 
group in a side chain. Different from a crystalline polymer such as polyethylene 
terephthalate or polybutylene terephthalate, a liquid crystalline 
polyester does not suffer from tangling of molecules in a molten 
state since the molecules are stiff, forms a polydomain having a 
crystal state, and molecular chains are highly orientated in a flow 
direction at a low
