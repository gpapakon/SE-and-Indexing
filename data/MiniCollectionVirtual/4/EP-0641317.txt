<DESCRIPTION>
U.S. Patent 4,780,127 relates to certain 2-(substituted 
benzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanediones and their use as 
herbicides. The compound of this invention is generically 
taught by this patent. This invention relates to 2-(2-chloro-3-ethoxy-4-ethylsulfonyl 
benzoyl)-5-methyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione, its 
herbicidal use and to herbicidal compositions containing the 
compound. The compound of this invention has the structural 
formula 
Salts of the above-described compound are also the 
subject of the instant invention. The compound of this invention can have the following 
four structural formulae because of tautomerism:  
 
The circled proton on each of the four tautomers is 
reasonably labile. These protons are acidic and can be 
removed by any base to give a salt having an anion of the 
following four resonance forms: 
Examples of cations of these bases are inorganic 
cations such as alkali metals e.g. lithium, sodium, and 
potassium or organic cations such as substituted ammonium, 
sulfonium or phosphonium wherein the substituent is an aliphatic 
or aromatic group.  
 The compound of this invention and its salts have 
unexpected exceptional herbicidal activity against certain 
plant species and have unexpected exceptional crop selectivity. The compound of the present invention can be prepared 
by the following two-step general method. The process proceeds via the production of an enol 
ester intermediate as shown in reaction (1). The final 
product is obtained by rearrangement of the enol ester as 
shown in reaction (2). The two reactions may be conducted as 
separate steps by isolation and recovery of the enol ester 
using conventional techniques prior to conducting step (2), 
or by addition of a cyanide source to the reaction medium 
after the formation of the enol ester, or in one step by 
inclusion of the cyanide source at the start of reaction (1). 
 
wherein Y is halogen, preferably chlorine, C1-C4 alkyl-C(O)-O-, 
C1-C4 alkoxy-C(O)-O or 
  
 
wherein the moderate base is as defined, preferably tri-C1-C6 
alkylamine, pyridine, alkali metal carbonate or alkali metal 
phosphate. Generally, in step (1) mole amounts of the dione 
and substituted benzoyl reactant are used, along with a mole 
amount or excess of the base. The two reactants are combined 
in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride, toluene, 
ethyl acetate or dimethylformamide. The base or benzoyl 
reactant preferably are added to the reaction mixture with 
cooling. The mixture is stirred at 0°C-50°C until the reaction 
is substantially
