<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heat-resistant, propylene
resin-based molding materials which are excellent in
moldability, and which can produce less warped, lightweight
molded products having high heat resistance and high
strength.Molded products obtained from a propylene resin are
excellent in mechanical strength, processability and
economical efficiency, so that they have been widely used
in the field of industrial parts such as automotive parts.
Further, in such a field where high rigidity and high heat
resistance are especially required, high-performance
composite materials composed of a propylene resin and an
inorganic filler such as talc or glass fibers have been
practically used. Such composite materials have been
widely used, for example, for automotive parts, in
particular, interior parts such as a trim and an instrument
panel, exterior parts such as a bumper, and functional
parts such as a fan shroud.The conventional composite materials composed of a
propylene resin and glass fibers possess a high level of
heat resistance. However, there is a problem with the
conventional composite materials that when they are
subjected to injection molding and then cooled, the
resulting molded product tends to thermally shrink to warp.
As a method for preventing the molded product from warping,
it is known to increase the fluidity of the composite
molding material. It is also known to additionally use
flat-shaped fillers such as talc and mica in the composite
molding material. However, these methods are not
satisfactory in that the prevention of warping in the
molded product is insufficient, or in that the required use 
of a large amount of filler increases the density of the
composition, leading to a heavier molded product.
An example of a known molding material is described
in US-A-4 983 647 which discloses a reinforced
polypropylene composition comprising an impregnated
glass fibre melt-kneaded with a crystalline
polypropylene modified by an unsaturated acid or a
silane and an unmodified polypropylene.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a propylene resin-based molding material which
has high heat resistance and good moldability and which can
produce lightweight molded products with very little
warping.It has now been found by the present inventors that
the above object can be attained by using a specific resin-impregnated
glass fiber bundle together with a specific
propylene resin.Thus, the present invention provides a heat-resistant,
propylene resin-based molding material,
comprising
