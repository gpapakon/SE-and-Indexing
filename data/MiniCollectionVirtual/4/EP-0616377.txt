<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
light-emitting element as specified in claim
1, and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor light-emitting
element as specified in claim 8.Preferably, the present invention relates to a
semiconductor 
light-emitting element using an InGaAlP system mixed
crystal with a high brightness as a Light Emitting Layer in
a LED, and a method for fabricating this semiconductor
light-emitting element, and, in particular, to a
semiconductor light-emitting element with superior
resistance to humidity and with a long life expectancy
providing high output performance, and a method for
fabricating this semiconductor light-emitting element. A semiconductor light-emitting element
and a method of manufacturing a
light-emitting element
are known from US-A-5 153 889. Therein, it is described a
semiconductor light-emitting element and a method of
manufacturing a semiconductor light-emitting element which
comprises a crystal layer formed from aluminium of a high mol
ratio of 60% or greater on the light producing surface,
wherein a conductive crystal containing no aluminium is
formed on the high aluminium crystal layer.A semiconductor light-emitting device having a
protection layer in general is known from Patent Abstracts of
Japan, Vol. 15, No. 78 (E-1037) and JP-A-2 298 083.Moreover, a light-emitting diode (LED) has been 
developed with a light-emitting layer of an InGaAlP mixed
crystal system, as a high brilliant LED. The use of a
Ga1-xAlxAs current spreading layer, as a current diffusion
layer, with a high ratio of mixed Al crystals (hereinafter
XAl) on the light extracting surface is a structural feature
of this LED. (Hereinafter there will be cases where, for
brevity, when the ratio of included Al is high, the term
"high Al" will be used, and when this ratio is low, the term
"low Al" will be used.)FIG.1 is a general sectional view of an orange colored
light-emitting InGaAlP LED formed using conventional
technology.For example, with epitaxial growth of a yellow
light-emitting InGaAlP LED used as an example, as
illustrated in FIG.1, an n-type In0.5(Ga0.3Al0.7)0.5 P-clad
layer 2 with a film thickness of 1.0 µm fabricated by a
metal organic chemical vapor deposition method (MOCVD 
method) is formed on an n-type GaAs substrate 1, and then,
an n-type In0.5(Ga0.72Al0.28)0.5 P active layer 3 with a
film thickness of 0.5 µm, a P-type In0.5(Ga0.3Al0.7)0.5
P-clad layer 4 with a film thickness of 1.0 µm, and a P-type
Ga0.2Al0.8As current spreading layer 5 with a film
thickness of 10
