<ABSTRACT>
A safety means for preventing a cable drum to rotate with 
overspeed has parallel ratchet wheels (8,9,10) which encircle 

a brake drum (3). At a periphery of the ratchet wheels are 
stopping slots wherein latching means (36) are inserted when 

an overspeed is detected. The slots of the adjacent ratchet 
wheels (8,9,10) are staggered. Thus the braking effect of each 

ratchet wheel (8,9,10) starts at a different point of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a safety mechanism for a
hoist having a lowering speed limit. The safety mechanism is
activated as the speed of the load exceeds the lowering limit
by a latch which locks the ratchet wheel which is rotating
with the cable drum of the hoist. The ratchet wheel has a
brake lining against the cable drum.US patent 4,520,998 shows a safety mechanism as described
above. In this system, the drum is braked with a very high
braking force in the beginning of the stopping because the
brake linings may get stuck in the drum before the safety
mechanism is activated. Therefore the detaching force may have
a very high value before the brake lining of the ratchet wheel
begins to slide on the surface of the drum. The ropes may also
be weakened during over time and therefore it is possible that
the ropes may be broken when the braking force is very high.
The ropes should bear a force that is needed to decelerate a
maximum load from a certain speed within a predetermined
distance. The braking moment should not exceed this force in
any situation.It is an object of this invention to produce a safety mechanism
for a hoist which is activated when the lowering speed
exceeds a predetermined limit and which will act reliably in
all circumstances and will cause only limited braking force
also in the beginning of the braking. The force will be essentially
constant during the braking period. This problem is
solved by the present invention in that the safety mechanism
comprises at least two ratchet wheels surrounding a brake drum
and being substantially parallel in the axial direction of brake drum. The
safety mechanism is hereinafter called also as a drum brake in 
this specification. Each of said ratchet wheels are lined with
a brake lining interposed between the ratchet wheel and said
drum. The ratchet wheels are fixed to and rotatable with said
brake drum by the frictional force exerted by said brake
linings on said brake drum. In order to activate the brake,
each of said ratchet wheels are provided at its periphery with
at least one stopping slot and at least one of said stopping
slots are located forwardly in the rotation direction of the drum
compared to at least one other stopping slot
on another ratchet wheel.
When activating
the drum brake, a latching means is inserted into one
of said stopping slots
on at least two of said ratchet wheels
thus preventing rotation of the respective
ratchet wheels when said predetermined cable speed limit is exceeded.In a development of the present

<CLAIMS>
A safety mechanism for a crane to prevent a cable drum
operated hoist from operating above a predetermined cable

speed limit, comprising:

(a) a brake drum (3) directly connected to the cable drum
(2) of the hoist, the brake drum (3) being rotatable with

the cable drum (2) in a rotation direction;
(b) at least two ratchet wheels (8,9,10) surrounding said
brake drum (3) and being substantially parallel in the axial

direction of said brake drum (3);
(c) each of said ratchet wheels (8,9,10) being lined with a
brake lining (30) interposed between the ratchet wheel

(8,9,10) and said brake drum (3), said ratchet wheels
(8,9,10) being fixed to and rotatable with said brake drum

(3) by the frictional force exerted by said brake linings
(30) on said brake drum (3);
(d) at least one stopping slot being provided at a periphery
of each of said ratchet wheels (8,9,10), at least one of

said stopping slots on one of the rachet wheels (8,9,10)
being located forwardly in the rotation direction of the

drum (3) compared to at least one other stopping slot on
another of the ratchet wheels (8,9,10); and
(e) latching means (36) insertable into at least one of
said stopping slots

on at least two of said ratchet wheels
for preventing rotation of the respective

ratchet wheels when said predetermined cable speed limit is exceeded.
The safety mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein at
least one of said ratchet wheels (8,9,10) is comprised of one

substantially circular part with a screw (16) extending between
ends (12,14) of the substantially circular part, the

screw (16) holding the at least one ratchet wheel on said
brake drum (3).
The safety mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the stopping slots are so arranged that

said
latching means (36) enters simultaneously into stopping

slots of all said ratchet wheels (8,9,10).

The safety mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
phase difference between the ratchet wheels (8,9,10) is adjustable.
The safety mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein a
plurality of stopping slots are provided on each of the ratchet

wheels (8,9,10) and wherein each stopping slot on one
ratchet wheel (8,9,10) is adjacent another stopping slot on an

adjacent ratchet wheel.
The safety mechanism as claimed in claim 7, wherein three
ratchet wheels (8,9,10) are provided, each of the ratchet

wheels (8,9,10) having a plurality of stopping slots, a middle
ratchet wheel (9) being located between the other two outer

ratchet wheels (8,10), each of the ratchet wheels (8,9,10)
having corresponding stopping slots with corresponding stopping

slots being adjacent to one another, each stopping slot on the
middle ratchet wheel (9) being located between corresponding

stopping slots in the rotation direction of the two outer
