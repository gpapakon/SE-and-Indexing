<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to new
toner compositions and developer compositions
containing a charge-controlling additive. More
specifically, the present invention is directed to
developer compositions containing toner particles and,
as a charge-controlling additive, a mixture of ortho-benzoic
sulfimide and para-anisic acid, which additive
imparts a negative charge to the toner resin particles.Developer compositions containing charge
enhancing additives are known in the prior art,
particularly, those developers containing charge
enhancing additives which impart a positive charge to
the toner resin. However, very few developer
compositions are known in the art wherein charge
enhancing or charge-controlling additives are employed
for the purpose of imparting a negative charge to the
toner resin. Examples of positively charged toner
compositions include those described in US-A-3,893,935,
wherein there is disclosed the use of certain
quaternary ammonium compounds as charge-control agents
for electrostatic toner compositions. This patent
states that certain quaternary ammonium compounds when
incorporated into toner materials were found to provide
a toner composition which exhibited a relatively high
uniform and stable net toner charge when mixed with a
suitable carrier particle. A similar teaching is
described in US-A-4,079,014 with the exception that a
different charge-control additive is employed, namely,
a diazo compound. Other charge enhancing additives are
described, for example, in US-A-4,298,672, wherein
there is disclosed developer compositions containing as
charge enhancing additives certain alkyl pyridinium 
halides, particularly cetyl pyridinium chloride for the
purpose of imparting a positive charge to the toner
resin.Electrophotographic images are typically made
in two different ways. In optical copiers, for
example, the image on a printed page is reproduced
through optical exposure (generally reflection from a
mirror) of the page to the photoconductor. Where the
page is white or lightly colored, the light reflected
from the page discharges the photoconductor. Light is
not reflected from the dark areas of the page and
consequently the photoconductor retains its original
charge in these areas. If the photoconductor was
originally charged negatively, the areas to be toned
would naturally attract positively charged toners.A second way of making electrostatographic
images is to write the image using an array of light
emitting diodes (LED's) or lasers to discharge the
photoconductor.
