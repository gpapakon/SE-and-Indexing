Pelleting apparatus for drained paste-like material, especially sewage sludge, 
having a sludge tank of funnel-shaped cross-section having a device which 

conveys the paste-like sludge material into the tank and builds up pressure therein, 
having a mould with a plurality of through holes arranged beneath the tank, the 

mould consisting of a mould bottom part or shearing part and a mould top part 
located above the mould bottom part, at least one of the parts being displaceable 

relative to the other in the transverse plane for the purpose of cutting off the 
pellets, characterised in that the outlet of the tank (3) comprises a first and a 

second height-adjustable slide member (4, 5) arranged on the tank wall, that the 
end of the slide members (4, 5) forming the tank outlet is sealable with the upper 

side of the mould top part (7) lying opposite the tank outlet to the passage of 
sludge, that the mould top part (7) has at least one perforated zone (9) and a non-perforated 

blank zone (10), the area of each of the zones corresponding at least to 
the area of the tank outlet, that the mould top part (7) is in connection with a 

separate drive means, that the mould bottom part (11) is connected to a driving 
device performing an oscillating movement and that a device that removes non-pelletable 

sludge material in a controlled manner acts on the perforated zone (9). 
Pelleting apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the tank (3) is a 

pressure tank. 
Pelleting apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the through holes 
(14, 15) present in the mould top part and bottom part (7, 11) are fixed in rows of 

equal spacing. 
Pelleting apparatus according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that in the mould 
top part (7) the free blank zone (10) lies after two successive perforated zones (8, 

9).  
 
Pelleting apparatus according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the non-perforated 
blank zone (10) lies between two perforated zones (8, 9). 
Pelleting apparatus according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the through 
holes (15) of the mould bottom part (11) have a larger diameter compared with the 

through holes (14) of the mould top part (7).
