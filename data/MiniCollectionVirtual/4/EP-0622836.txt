<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of encapsulating electronic components (1) mounted, according to a hybridation technique by balls, on a substrate (3). It further relates to the encapsulated electronic component obtained by implementing this method. This method consists:   - in arranging balls (6a, 6b, 6c, etc.) on the substrate, around an electronic component in order to form a carpet of balls (6) which is contiguous with the said electronic component; - in depositing at least one drop (7) of an encapsulating substance on the carpet of balls, the balls of the carpet impregnated with the surface being able to make this substance migrate by capillarity, towards the balls situated between the said electronic component and the substrate.   Application in microelectronics, computing and optoelectronics.

Process for coating an electronic component (1) fitted on a substrate
(3) using a bump (5) hybridization procedure, comprising placing a plurality

of bumps (6a, 6b, 6c) on the substrate around said fitted electronic component
in order to form a belt of bumps (6) contiguous to said electronic

component and depositing at least one drop (7) of a coating substance on the
bump belt, the bumps of the belt impregnated with coating substance being

able to make said substance migrate by capillarity towards the bumps
located between said electronic component and said substrate.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists of
choosing the dimensions of the bump belt as a function of the substance

quantity to be deposited there.
Process according to either of the claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
it consists of producing the bump belt with bumps having variable dimensions,

in order to ensure a more intense capillarity force from an outer
edge of the belt towards the bumps located between the electronic component

and the substrate.
Coated electronic component fitted to a substrate according to a bump
hybridization procedure, characterized in that it is at least partly

surrounded by a bump belt placed on the substrate contiguous to the hybridization
bumps and impregnated with a coating substance.
