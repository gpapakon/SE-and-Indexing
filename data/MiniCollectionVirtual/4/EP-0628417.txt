<ABSTRACT>
A video printing apparatus and method in which, without interlocking the 
movement of the printing head with the capstan for carrying the printing paper and 

the paper feeding mechanism by a cam and linkage mechanism, they are 
respectively operated by three independent motors. The printer includes a first 

normally and reversely rotatable DC motor (101) for searching the head of the ink 
ribbon (10) of the ribbon cassette (1) housed in the printer and for taking up the ink 

ribbon by the take-up reel base (111) during the printing operation. A second 
normally and reversely rotatable stepping motor (102) is provided for carrying the 

printing paper (202) housed in the tray (200) by the capstan (410) and the pinch 
roller (411) to the printing position and the paper delivering position. A third 

normally and reversely rotatable DC motor (300) is provided for moving the 
printing head (323) which subjects the printing paper to the printing processing by 

pressing the ink ribbon (10) of the ribbon cassette thereon in cooperation with the 
platen. A control mechanism for locking the tray (200) in position, pressing the 

printing paper in the tray into engagement with a first feeding roller (213) and 
moving the pinch roller (411) into engagement with the capstan (410) includes a 

plurality of cams (416, 417) disposed on a common axis which are driven by the 
first motor (101).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a printer for saving a recording
picture, such as a video picture or the like, as a hard copy, and particularly to a
sublimation type thermal transfer system video printer for producing a hard copy
of a video picture.Conventional video printers include a gear mechanism for searching a head
of an ink ribbon of a ribbon cassette housed in the printer and taking up the ink
ribbon by a take-up reel during a printing operation using a DC motor as a drive
source. These printers typically include a gear mechanism for feeding a printing
paper housed in a tray, and a cam mechanism for pressing the ink ribbon on the
printing paper and moving a printing head, which subjects the printing paper to a
printing processing. A DC motor is provided for moving the printing head and for
use as a drive source to rotate a capstan for carrying the printing paper to a printing
position and a paper delivering position successively. A complex cam mechanism
and a link mechanism are required to drive the paper feeding mechanism, the cam
mechanism and the printing head with a single drive motor. Other printer devices
include a stepping motor as a second drive source for driving one or more of the
printer mechanisms.These conventional printers suffer from a linkage and drive mechanism
which is complex and space consuming and fails to provide effective operation in
the event of paper jams or other interruptions during normal printing operations.
Thus, one object of the present invention is to provide a printer construction
whereby miniaturization of the printer can be realized and printer operations can be
enhanced under adverse conditions.Another problem with conventional video printers is that they waste printer
ribbon between successive printing operations. Conventional printers typically
include a mechanism for holding a printing paper and an ink ribbon between a
printing head and a platen and use a stepping motor as a drive source and a cam
mechanism for pressing and heating the ink ribbon on the printing paper for
printing processing. When the ink ribbon is released from the printing paper, it has
a slack between the supply reel and the take-up reel of the ribbon cassette. This
slack is typically removed by winding the ribbon in the direction of winding
during the printing operation, thereby increasing the amount of ribbon required for
printing. In addition, identification systems on ribbon cassettes often require 
rotation of the take-up and/or supply reels resulting in further waste

<CLAIMS>
A video printer comprising :

a normally and reversely rotatable first drive motor (101) for searching a
head of an ink ribbon (10) of a ribbon cassette (1) housed in said printer and for

taking up the ink ribbon by a take-up reel (14) during a printing operation;
a normally and reversely rotatable second drive motor (102) for feeding a
printing paper (202) housed in a tray through a carrying roller by a capstan (410)

and a pinch roller (411) to a printing position and a paper delivering position; and
a normally and reversely rotatable third drive motor (300) for identifying
said ink ribbon by a ribbon code ring (21) and for moving a printing head (323),

which subjects said printing paper to a printing processing, by pressing the ink
ribbon thereon with a platen (412).
A printer as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first drive motor (101)
comprises a DC motor.
A printer as claimed in claim 2, wherein said second drive motor (102)

comprises a stepping motor.
A printer as claimed in claim 3, wherein said third drive motor (300)
comprises a DC motor.
