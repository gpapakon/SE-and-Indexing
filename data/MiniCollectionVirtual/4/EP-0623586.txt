<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for the preparation of 2-(1-cyclohexenyl)ethylamine by reduction of 2-phenylethylamine with lithium in the presence of a primary or secondary aliphatic alkylamine is described. 2-(1-Cyclohexenyl)ethylamine can be used as a starting material for the preparation of dextromethorphan, a cough-relieving pharmaceutical.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of 2-(1-cyclohexenyl)-ethylamine, 
characterized in that 2-phenylethylamine is 

reduced with lithium in the presence of a primary or 
secondary aliphatic alkylamine at a temperature between 

-100°C and -10°C, wherein 3.8 to 4.2 moles of lithium are 
used relative to 1 mole of 2-phenylethylamine. 
The process of claim 1, characterized in that the reduction 
is carried out with a primary aliphatic (C₁-C₄)-alkylamine. 
The process of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
reduction is carried out with ethylamine.
