<ABSTRACT>
Method for building inside and outside walls of a 
building, characterised in that use is made of elongated 

construction elements of wood or light concrete (2) 
which are piled up each other and connected with each 

other in vertical direction by anchoring profiles (7) 
with U-shaped, circular or n-angular cross section to 

the construction elements (2). 
The profiles (7) with U-shaped, circular or n-angular 
cross section show in the longitudinal direction 

notches (7.1) occurring at distances corresponding with 
the heights of the construction elements (2). 
In these notches (7.1) the profiles (8) and (11) 
are inserted with their narrowest side, and rotated over 

90 degrees, so that the profiles (8) and (11) are 
unbreakable connected to the profiles (7), with U-shaped, 

circular or n-angular cross section. 
Then the profiles (8) and (11) are connected to the 
construction elements (2) by means of the profiles (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an assembly according to the preamble of claim 1.An assembly according to the preamble of
claim 1 is knowm from, e.g. FR 2 591 291 A.The object of the invention is to realise an
assembly allowing to build walls or wall parts by means of
elements which are easy to use and allow a correct fastening of the
several components to be assembled.This object is solved according to the features of
claim 1.Other details and advantages of embodiments of the invention
will appear from the following description of an assembly of a
connection part with a profile for connecting construction elements
according to an embodiment of the invention. The
reference numbers relate to the drawings added herewith.Figures 1 and 2 show a section between two
construction elements.Figure 3 shows a top view of the end of a wall,
with construction elements and connection parts, where
an other wall can be coupled later.Figure 4 is a side-view according to figure 3.Figure 5 is a vertical section according to figure
3.Figures 6 and 7 are, with the necessary breaks,
perspective views according to figure 3.Figure 8 shows, with the necessary breaks, a
perspective view with token apart connection parts.Figure 9 shows a top view of two walls, which are
connected together with the necessary connection parts.Figure 10 is a side-view according to figure 9.Figures 11 and 12 are, with the necessary breaks
perspective views according to figure 9.Figure 13 shows with the necessary breaks a
perspective view with token apart connecting parts.Figures 14, 17 and 20 show in top view, figures 15,
18 and 21 show in side-view and figures 16, 19 and 22
show in perspective view the possibility to anchor the
construction elements to the profiles with U-shaped,
circular or n-angular cross section.Figures 23 and 24 show in perspective view the
connection, in longitudinal direction, mutually between
two construction elements.Figure 25 show, with the necessary breaks, in
perspective view the connection of the walls at their 
ends, and the connection of a wall at its end, with an
other wall at a random place in that wall.The construction elements which are used
are elongated elements 1 or 2.The construction elements 1 or 2 show in the
longitudinal direction, along their narrow side, at
least one continuous groove and along the opposite
narrow side at least one continuous bulge cooperating
therewith.The construction elements made of wood or light
concrete can be put on each other and be pressed
fittingly into each other, so that sideways, at
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Assembly of a connection part (8, 11) with a, in use, vertical profile (7)
for connecting elongaled construction elements (2) which are piled up on top of each

other to the profile (7) to build up walls or parts thereof

characterised in that
 the assembly consists of a combination of
the profile (7) with a U-shaped, circular or n-angular cross-section and

having at least one longitudinal notch (7.1), and a connection part
(8, 11) which has either a straight-shaped or L-shaped form and has at least one

extremity with a T-shaped head to be introduced in said notch
(7.1) and which remains hooked, after a rotation of 90Â° of the

connection part (8, 11) in said profile while the other extremity of the connection part (8, 11) is
designed so as to be linked with a construction element (2).
Assembly according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 said connection part (8) is flat and
rectangular.
Assembly according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 said connection part (11) is hook-shaped
both the arms of the hook-shaped connection part extending in the

same plane that, in use, may be considered as perpendicular with
regard to said profile (7).
Assembly according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 said connection part (11) is hook-shaped,
one arm of the hook-shaped connection part extending, in 

use, parallel with said longitudinal profile (7).
Assembly according to one of the claims 3 -
5, 
characterised in that
 said connection parts (8, 11) are provided
with at least one notch (8.1, 11.1) cooperating with said profile (7).
Assembly according to one of the claims 3-6,

characterised in that
 said connection parts are provided with at least
a second notch (8.2, 11.2) cooperating with anchoring means (9,

12, 13, 14).
