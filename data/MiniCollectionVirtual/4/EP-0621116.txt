<ABSTRACT>
A plastic material preparing method includes 
steps of: i) preparing a supplementary material by 

mixing plastic resins with a pigment powder of a dark 
color and then letting the mixture thus obtained be 

processed into a colored, grained supplementary material 
through a pilling machine; ii) preparing a base material 

by mixing plastic resins with a pigment powder of a 
light color and then letting the mixture thus obtained 

be processed into a colored, grained base material 
through a pilling machine; and iii) mixing the 

supplementary material with the base material into a 
grained plastic material assorted in color for making 

plastic products having a wood grain.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
preparing a grained plastic material assorted in color, 
that can be used for making plastic products having a 
wood grain by means of an extruding machine. Regular plastic resins are commonly 
transparent. When these plastic resins are directly 
put in an extruding machine or any plastics processing 
machine, the finished products thus obtained are also 
transparent. In order to obtain a finished plastic 
product having a specific color, transparent plastic 
resins must be processed into a colored, grained plastic 
material. According to conventional method, this 
colored, grained plastic material is obtained by mixing 
transparent plastic resins with a powder pigment in a 
mixer and then putting the mixture thus obtained in a 
pilling machine for making into the desired colored, 
grained plastic material (see Figure 1). However, 
such a colored, grained plastic material can only be 
used for making plastic products having a single color. 
A colored, grained plastic material obtained according 
to the aforesaid method cannot be used for making 
plastic products having a wood grain. Therefore, a  
 
printing process must be employed to print little lines 
and markings on the plastic products. The present invention has been accomplished 
under the aforesaid circumstances. It is therefore the 
principal object of the present invention to provide a 
method of preparing a grained plastic material assorted 
in colors for making plastic products having a wood 
grain by means of an extruding machine. According to one aspect of the present 
invention, the plastic material preparing method 
comprises a first step to prepare a supplementary 
material by mixing plastic resins with a pigment powder 
of a dark color and then letting the mixture thus 
obtained be processed into a colored, grained 
supplementary material through a pilling machine, a 
second step to prepare a base material by mixing plastic 
resins with a pigment powder of a light color and then 
letting the mixture thus obtained be processed into a 
colored, grained base material through a pilling 
machine, and a third step to mix the supplementary 
material with the base material at 1:10 by weight into a 
grained plastic material assorted in color. When 
finished, the supplementary material and the base  
 
material have different softness and melting point. 
Therefore, a plastic product which is made from this 
grained plastic material assorted in color shows a wood 
grain on the outside surface. In an
