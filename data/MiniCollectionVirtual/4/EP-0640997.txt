<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a switch adapted to close upon 
pressing of a movable piece (13) initially in open position 

by an actuator (3). The actuator is made of a material 
which melts at a predetermined temperature such that the 

switch opens when melting of the actuator (3) by the heat 
generated on flow of an overcurrent to the movable piece 

(13) allows the movable piece (13) to return to its initial 
position. The invention further provides a switch of the 

type that a movable piece (13) closes or opens the switch 
according to movement of an actuator (3). The movable piece 

(13) being made of a material which fuses at a 
predetermined temperature such that the switch opens upon 

fusion of the movable piece (13) by the heat generated on 
flow of a
n overcurrent to the movable piece (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel switch suitable 
for use as a window regulator switch, sunroof switch or 
the like. For the overcurrent protection of direct-off type 
switches, it is common practice to employ a PCB pattern 
fuse or a built-in overcurrent protective device, or, 
in the case of bus bar type switches, to utilize the 
rising of a movable piece on melting of a resin member 
supporting it to cause an OFF fault. For the overcurrent 
protection of microswitches, the only available 
provision is either the use of a PCB pattern fuse or a 
built-in overcurrent protective device. However, the PCB pattern fuse is not fully reliable 
because pattern width control during manufacture 
is so difficult that a large variation in functional 
quality is inevitable. On the other hand, the overcurrent 
protective device is not only expensive but 
adds to the bulk of the switch.  
 The object of this invention is to provide a novel 
switch which is simple in construction, does not  
 
require any modification of its basic components, and 
yet provides effective overcurrent protection 
without involving no major capital expenditure or 
addition of parts. In the German Utility Model DE-U-87 16 968.1 a 
switch is disclosed having a movable piece and a 
miniature fuse embodied as a bridging circuit to said 
switch. A similar switching device is known from 
GB-A-2 167 238. EP-A-0 285 044 discloses a temperature use for 
an electrical apparatus having a melting piece as a 
thermal actuator which melts at a predetermined 
temperature such that the electrical connection is 
opened when melting of the actuator allows a contact 
element to move. This invention relates, in one aspect, to a switch 
adapted to close upon pressing of a movable piece 
initially in open position by an actuator characterized 
in that the switch opens when melting of said actuator 
by the heat generated on flow of an overcurrent to said 
movable piece allows said movable piece to return to 
its initial position. This invention relates, in another aspect, to a 
switch adapted to close upon pressing of a movable 
piece initially in open position by an actuator characterized 
in that the switch is provided with a first 
means which opens the switch when melting of said 
actuator by the heat generated by flow of an overcurrent 
to said movable piece allows said movable  
 
piece to return to its initial position and a second 
means which opens the switch upon fusion of said 
movable piece by the heat generated on flow of an 
overcurrent to said

<CLAIMS>
A switch adapted to close upon pressing of a movable 
piece (13) initially in open position by an actuator (3), 

wherein said actuator (3) being made of a material 
which melts at a predetermined temperature such that the 

switch opens when melting of said actuator (3) allows said 
movable piece (13) to return to its initial position, 


characterized
 in that said actuator (3) is positioned such 
that the melting of said actuator (3) is caused by the heat 

generated on flow of an overcurrent to said movable piece 
(13). 
A switch in accordance to claim 1,
characterized
 by 

a first means (16) which opens the switch when 
melting of said actuator (3) by said heat generated by said 

flow of said overcurrent to said movable piece (13) allows 
said movable piece (13) to return to said initial position 

and 
a second means which opens the switch upon fusion of 
said movable piece (13) by the heat generated on flow of an 

overcurrent to said movable piece (13).
