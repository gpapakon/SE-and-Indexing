<ABSTRACT>
Rolls (2) of strip material, such as sheet copper alloy, of 
predetermined widths which are generally different from 

each other are formed by unwinding and shearing a roll (7) 
and winding the sheared strips of material side by side 

on a single common collecting reel (9); a tubular cardboard 
element (3) is previously mounted on this reel (9) and receives 

the sheared strips with the formation thereon of a 
plurality of coaxially adjacent rolls (2); subsequently the 

semi-finished product thus formed is removed from the 
reel (9) of the shearing machine (5) and mounted rigidly on a 

carrier cradle (20) and the tubular element (3) is sectioned into 
as many sections as there are rolls (2) formed thereon, by 

means of a cutting head (22) which moves along the axis of the 
tubular element (3), within the latter; the sections are cut 

in lengths equal to the widths of the respective rolls (2) 
wound on each of them and are then forwarded to a 

wrapping line for the rolls (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
production and forwarding for wrapping of rolls of strip 
material, particularly sheet metal. The invention also 
relates to a cutting device usable in this method. It is known that strip material, typically sheet metal 
intended to be worked by pressing or bending, is produced 
in rolls of commercial widths starting from rolls of 
larger widths coming directly from the rolling mill or 
from any subsequent heat treatments, by unwinding of the 
said roll and cutting longitudinally in the direction of 
unwinding, the roll thus being reduced to a plurality of 
strips each of which is wound so as to form a roll of the 
desired width. This operation is normally carried out by 
a shearing machine, the rolls of sheared material being 
collected in a position immediately alongside on a common 
winding reel of the shearing machine. Depending on the technique used, the rolls of sheared 
strip may be wound on a bare spindle or on cardboard 
cylinders each of width equal to that of the respective 
roll.  In the first case the strips must be fixed in the chuck 
of an expandable spindle, use frequently being made of 
double-sided adhesive tape to fix the first turn to the 
rest of the sheared roll which causes problems in the 
removal of the rolls wound on the spindle since the first 
turn of each roll may end beneath the turns of the 
adjacent roll or remain gripped by the spindle chuck, 
making it extremely difficult to separate the rolls and 
subsequently forward them to the wrapping line where the 
rolls are wrapped for sale. In the second case, the operators of the shearing 
machines must obtain cardboard cylinders cut to measure 
from an entire tube, which operation must be carried out 
off line and with the aid of a circular saw, and must 
then mount the cylinders on the winding spindle, centring 
them on the axis of the shearing machine and leaving 
interspaces between them, which operations are all slow 
and complicated. Moreover, during the expansion of the 
winding spindle it can easily happen that one or more of 
the cardboard cylinders breaks and must be replaced, with 
considerable loss of time. Both of the known methods of working thus involve long 
stoppages of the shearing machine, either for the removal 
of the rolls, or during their formation, with consequent 
high costs and low productivity.  The object of the invention is to provide a method for 
the production and forwarding for wrapping of rolls of 
strip material obtained by shearing of a

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production and forwarding for 
wrapping of rolls of strip material, particularly sheet 

strip metal, including a shearing step in which a 
plurality of rolls of the strip material of predetermined 

widths are formed simultaneously by the unwinding of a 
single roll of the strip material of suitable width and 

its cutting longitudinally in the direction of unwinding 
and by the winding of the strips of sheared material side 

by side on a single common collecting spindle of a 
shearing machine; 

characterised in that, before the shearing step, a 
disposable tubular element is mounted on the collecting 

spindle of the shearing machine which then receives the 
sheared strips with the formation thereon of a plurality 

of the said rolls disposed coaxially and adjacent each 
other; and in that, subsequently, the semi-finished 

product thus obtained is removed from the spindle of the 
shearing machine, is coupled to means for supporting the 

rolls and is subjected to a cutting step in which the 
tubular element is sectioned into as many sections as 

there are rolls formed thereon; the cutting step being 
effected by a cutting head which is moved along the axis 

of the tubular element and within the latter so as to cut 
the tube into sections each of a length equal to the 

width of the respective rolls wound thereon. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that, after the cutting step, the rolls, each supported 

by a respective one of the sections of the disposable 
tubular element, are disconnected from the support means, 

separated and forwarded to a line for packaging of the 
rolls. 
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that, before the step of shearing the 

roll of strip material, the disposable tubular element is 
subjected to an incising step in which a plurality of 

annular grooves is formed in its outer surface. 
A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the grooves are formed in predetermined axial positions 

by respective separator discs of the shearing machine in 
such a manner that, after the shearing step, they are 

located in line with the edge of each respective roll of 
strip material; the grooves being used during the cutting 

step as reference elements for the sectioning of the 
disposable tubular element. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that a cardboard tubular 

disposable element is used. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that, during the cutting step, 

the cutting head is held against the disposable tubular 
element and in that the latter is sectioned in a radial 

direction, from the inside to the outside of the 
disposable tubular element. 
A cutting device for separating a plurality of rolls 
of strip material of predetermined widths wound coaxially 

and side by side on a common disposable tubular support 
element; characterised in comprising a cradle for 

supporting the rolls provided with movable means for 
gripping the rolls so as to provide radial support for 

the rolls on the outside thereof at at least three points 
distributed along an arc of more than 180Â°; means for 

moving the cradle relative to the rolls perpendicular to 
the axis of the tubular element; and a cutting head 

adapted to move relative to the cradle along the axis and 
within the disposable tubular element to cut the latter 

into as many sections as there are rolls carried by the 
tubular element, each having a predetermined length; the 

cutting head including a first drum carried so as to be 
fixed for rotation with a rotatable shaft and in turn 

carrying a plurality of blades movable radially 
outwardly against the action of resilient means, and a 

second drum mounted for free rotation and 
coaxially on the first drum adapted to couple 

slidingly with a peripheral inner surface of the 
 

tubular element to be cut.

in that the blades are in the form of circular discs and 

are carried so as to be freely rotatable on, and partly 
projecting from, respective slides mounted so as to be 

radially slidable on the first drum; the slides being 
urged by resilient means such that their ends nearer the 

axis of rotation of the first drum cooperate with an 
inclined plate element movable along the axis of 

rotation.
