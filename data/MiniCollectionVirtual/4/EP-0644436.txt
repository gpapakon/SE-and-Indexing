<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic resonance apparatus including an active noise reduction arrangement 
(9, 49, 51, 53) for use by a patient (5) undergoing examination in the apparatus the 

transducers (25, 31) of the arrangement are non-magnetic, e.g. are of the electret, 
piezoelectric or condenser type, and have no parts of ferromagnetic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance apparatus.Such apparatus can be used for non-invasive internal examinations of patients to
produce, for example, cross-sectional internal structural images, and blood flow and
spectroscopy data.In use of such apparatus the part of the patient to be examined is placed in a region
of strong static magnetic field to define an equilibrium axis of magnetic alignment in the
examination region. A radio frequency (RF) magnetic field is then applied temporarily
to the examination region, in a direction orthogonal to the static magnetic field direction,
to excite magnetic resonance in material, typically hydrogen protons, in the examination
region. The resulting RF signals are detected and analysed. During this sequence of
operations one or more gradients are normally imposed on the static magnetic field in the
examination region, e.g. to encode spatially the detected RF signals, or for other purposes
such as flow encoding.The various fields applied in use of a magnetic resonance apparatus give rise to
appreciable noise which can be disturbing to a patient, especially when the patient is very
ill and/or the patient's head is being examined. To overcome this difficulty it has been
proposed to use an active noise reduction arrangement. Known active noise reduction
arrangements giving the required level of performance comprise a headset incorporating
two enclosures which fit respectively around the two ears of the patient. Each enclosure
houses a microphone which senses noise in the enclosure. The microphone signal is
processed remote from the headset and a resulting signal applied to a loudspeaker in the
enclosure to produce sound waves of a phase, amplitude and frequency such as to tend 
to reduce the noise heard by the patient to a minimum.One problem which arises with such an arrangement is that the headset
interferes with the static and RF magnetic fields required in the examination region,
more particularly the required uniformity of such fields.WO91/15896 discloses such a noise reduction system in which the
microphone and loudspeakers are housed in ported enclosures which are located
outside the RF field of the magnetic resonance apparatus to prevent them from
interfering with magnetic resonance signals. Ports made of non-magnetic material are
provided from the loudspeaker microphone enclosures for conveying the noise
reduction acoustic signals to a region adjacent to the patients head.WO90/02513 also discloses an active noise reduction arrangement in which
