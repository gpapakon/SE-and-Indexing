<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to topsheets for use in disposable
absorbent articles, particularly to topsheets for use in disposable
absorbent articles which isolate fecal material from the skin of the
wearer and to disposable absorbent articles incorporating such topsheets.Disposable absorbent articles are well known in the art. Disposable
absorbent articles are worn about the waist to collect and retain
exudates from the wearer. These disposable absorbent articles have a
liquid pervious topsheet which is worn in contact with the body of the
wearer. Bodily exudates, including urine and fecal material, pass
through the topsheet to be retained by, in, or near an absorbent core.Recent advancements in the art include disposable absorbent articles
which attempt to isolate fecal material from the skin of the wearer.
Such disposable absorbent articles often have a topsheet with an aperture
to allow fecal material to pass through the topsheet and which are
elasticized to conform closely to the wearer's body, particularly the
buttocks.The balance of the disposable absorbent article may be spaced away
from the topsheet, creating a void space for the receipt of fecal
material. Examples of such attempts in the art include U.S. Patent
4,834,737 issued May 30, 1989 to Khan and U.S. Patent 5,062,840 issued
November 5, 1991 to Holt et al.Certain attempts in the art only elasticize selected portions of the
disposable absorbent article. For example, the topsheet of the
disposable absorbent article may be divided into different sections, some 
of which are elasticized and some of which are not. Examples of such
attempts in the art include U.S. Patent 4,655,760 issued April 7, 1987 to
Morman et al. and British Patent Application 1,520,740 published
August 9, 1978 in the name of Tong.Other attempts in the art elasticize particular portions of the
topsheet of the disposable absorbent article. Such elastication has been
achieved through the use of linear elastic strands and elastic panels.
Further advances in the art include topsheets which have an elastic
modulus that provides a close fitting topsheet that is more comfortable
to the wearer. Examples of such attempts in the art include commonly
assigned U.S. Patent 4,892,536 issued January 9, 1990 to DesMarais et
al., commonly assigned U.S. Patent 4,990,147 issued February 5, 1991 to
Freeland, U.S. Patent 5,037,415 issued August 6, 1991 to Leroy et al.,
and commonly assigned U.S. Patent 5,037,416 issued August 6, 1991 to
Allen et al. EP 0 386 816 describes a disposable
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A topsheet (22) for use in a disposable absorbent article (20)
having a front waist margin (32), a rear waist margin (34), and a

longitudinal axis (LL), said topsheet (22) comprising:

a front trisection (22F) adapted to be juxtaposed with said front
waist margin (32) of said disposable absorbent article (20), said front

trisection (22F) being generally inelastic;
a rear trisection (22R) adapted to be juxtaposed with said rear waist
margin (34) of said disposable absorbent article (20), said rear trisection

(22R) being longitudinally elastically extensible; and
a central trisection (22C) intermediate said front trisection (22F) and
said rear trisection (22R), at least a portion of said central trisection (22C)

being transversely elastically extensible,

characterised in that said central trisection (22C) being generally H-shaped
whereby said central trisection longitudinally extends into at least

one of said front trisection (22F) and said rear trisection (22R).
A topsheet (22) for use in a disposable absorbent article (20)
according to claim 1, said topsheet (22) further comprising curvilinear

borders between said trisections (22F, 22R, 22C).
A topsheet (22) for use in a disposable absorbent article (20)
according to claim 1 or 2, further characterised in that said topsheet (22) is

unapertured and creates a pocket (46) at least in said rear trisection for
the receipt of fecal material. 
A disposable absorbent article according to Claims 1 and 2
characterized in that said rear trisection comprises an elastic

panel, and

preferably said elastic panel of said rear trisection has an
elongation greater than 50% and less than 350% under a tensile

load of about 800 grams per centimeter of width.
A disposable absorbent article according to Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4
characterized in that said central trisection comprises linear

elastic strands.
A disposable absorbent article according to Claims 1, 2, 3 and 4
characterized in that said central trisection comprises an elastic

panel, and

preferably said elastic panel of said central trisection has an
elongation greater than 50% and less than 350% under a tensile

load of about 800 grams per centimeter of width.
A topsheet for use in a disposable absorbent article having a front
waist margin, a rear waist margin, and a longitudinal axis, said

topsheet comprising:

a front trisection adapted to be juxtaposed with said front waist
margin of said disposable absorbent article, said front

trisection being generally inelastic; 
a rear trisection adapted to be juxtaposed with said rear waist
margin of said disposable absorbent article, said rear waist

margin being longitudinally elastically extensible; and
a central trisection intermediate said front trisection and said
rear trisection, said central trisection being transversely

elastically extensible.
A topsheet according to Claim 7 characterized in that at least one
of said rear trisection and said central trisection comprises

elastic panels, and preferably both said rear trisection and said
central trisection comprise elastic panels.
A topsheet according to Claim 7 characterized in that at least one
of said rear trisection and said central trisection comprises linear

elastic strands, and preferably both said rear trisection and said
central trisection comprise linear elastic strands.
A topsheet according to Claims 7, 8 and 9 characterized in that said
topsheet is unapertured and creates a pocket in said rear trisection

for the receipt of fecal material, and

preferably said central trisection longitudinally extends into at
least one of the said front trisection and said rear

trisection, and
more preferably said central trisection is generally H-shaped.
