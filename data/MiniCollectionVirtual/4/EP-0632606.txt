<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for establishing frame 
synchronization in a satellite communication system 

which receives a modulated signal having frames, such 
that a unique word and data are multiplexed in each of 

the frames. A demodulator demodulates the modulated 
signal and provides a demodulated signal including the 

unique words. A signal detector compares the signal 
power of the demodulated signal with a threshold 

signal and provides a detection signal. A selector 
provides, in accordance with the detection signal, the 

detected demodulated signal or fixed data as a 
selected signal. A frame synchronizing circuit 

detects the unique word from the selected signal, when 
the demodulated signal is provided as the selected 

signal by the selector, and establishes frame 
synchronization in accordance with the detected unique 

word.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for establishing and maintaining frame
synchronization in a mobile satellite communication
system, and more particularly, for establishing and
maintaining frame synchronization on the basis of
unique word (UW) detection to prevent erroneous
operation due to shadowing phenomena occurring on the
transmission path.In satellite communication systems, forward error
correction (FEC) techniques with high coding gain or
high-efficiency speech coding are used to reduce the
required transmission power and raise the channel
capacity. Usually, such satellite communication
systems are operated at extremely low carrier-power to
noise-power (C/N) ratios. Therefore, in a satellite
communication system employing high-coding gain error
correction or high-efficiency speech coding
techniques, it is desirable to maintain stable frame
synchronization at such low C/N ratios. In order to access a satellite channel and
thereby link the satellite channel to a station, it is
necessary to synchronize the transmission and
receiving timing of the frames in the signal. That
is, the rate at which the frames of the communication
signal are transmitted by the satellite or stations
must be synchronized with the rate at which such
frames are detected by the satellite or station.Such frame synchronization can typically be
accomplished by using a unique word (UW) in a preamble
added to the initial portion of a burst signal, or
unique words periodically provided in frames of the
signal. The unique word or words used for frame
synchronization can also be used to resolve phase
ambiguity of the communication signal, or identify a
satellite channel.A number of different frame synchronization
systems for such purposes have been proposed (see, for
example, "Frame Synchronization", Japanese laid-open
Patent Application No. Sho 61 (1986) -22481, and Japanese
laid-open Patent No. Sho 62 (1987)-180634). Among
these, the systems which establish frame
synchronization by examining the demodulated bit
stream on a bit-by-bit basis to detect the unique word
are most common. Fig. 9 illustrates a block diagram of a
conventional frame synchronization system. As shown,
the received modulated signals are supplied to a
demodulator 1 and demodulated into baseband
demodulated signals. The demodulated signals are
supplied to a UW detector 6, where a unique word UW is
detected from the demodulated signals. When a UW is
detected in the UW detector, a frame synchronizing
circuit 7 sets the timing for receiving the
