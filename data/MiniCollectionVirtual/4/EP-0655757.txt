<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a switch 
assembly including a device for preventing the switch 

from being accidentally actuated, in particular for 
motor vehicles and the like, which comprises an 

actuating push-button (3), which can be displaced from an 
OFF position to an ON position and vice versa. 
The main feature of the invention is that 
on the push-button (3) there is provided a slider 

element (10), including a lug (11) which can be removably 
engaged with a locking element (15) for holding the push-button 

in an OFF position, the slider element being 
displaceable, against the biassing of resilient 

means (20), in order to disengage the lug (11) from the locking 
element (15) and allow the push-button (3) to pass from the 

OFF position to the ON position thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switch
assembly including a safety device for preventing the
switch from being accidentally actuated, in
particular for motor vehicles and the like.As is known, it is frequently necessary to
provide, in electric systems, a switch which is
normally held in an OFF position and can be switched
to its ON position exclusively as it is required.This is the case, in particular, of the
motor vehicles in which there is usually provided a
switch for switching off the electrical connection
with the vehicle battery, which switch, particularly
for vehicles provided for transporting dangerous
goods, represents a very important safety element.A very important feature of such a switch
is that it can not be accidentally switched on since,
in such a case, it would switch on the battery
thereby providing a dangerous condition, in
particular as the vehicle is in movement.Prior switches for the above mentioned use,
for example, the switch assembly in accordance with the
preamble of claim 1 and known from DE-A-1 947 014,
have not been found to be fully satisfactory in
operation. Accordingly, the aim of the present
invention is to provide a switch assembly, including
a safety device adapted to prevent the switch
assembly from being accidentally actuated, in
particular for motor vehicles and the like, which
requires a deliberated operation to be switched to
its ON condition.Within the scope of the above mentioned
aim, a main object of the present invention is to
provide such a switch assembly which, while having
remarkably improved operating features, is moreover
very simple from a mere construction standpoint and
can be made by conventional methods for making
switches.Another object of the present invention is
to provide such a switch assembly which is very
reliable and safe in operation and which, moreover,
can be easily made starting from easily commercially
available elements and materials and which,
moreover, is very competitive from a mere economic
standpoint.The above mentioned aim and objects 
are achieved by a switch
assembly including a safety device for preventing
said switch assembly from being accidentally
actuated, in particular for motor vehicles and the
like, as defined in claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages of
the invention will become more apparent from the
following detailed disclosure of a switch assembly
including a safety device for preventing the switch
from being accidentally actuated, in particular for
motor vehicles and the like, which is illustrated, by
wa
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A switch assembly (1) including a safety
device for preventing said switch assembly from being

accidentally actuated, in particular for motor
vehicles and the like, comprising an operating push-button

(3) which can be displaced from an OFF
position to an ON position and vice versa, and, on

said push-button (3), a slider (10) provided with a
lug (11) which is removably be engagable with a

locking element (15) in order to hold said push-button (3)
in an OFF position thereof, said lug having a

centering peg (22) integral therewith and extending
substantially perpendicular therefrom, said slider

(10) being adapted to be driven, against resilient
spring (20), in order to disengage said lug (11) from

said locking element (15) and allow said push-button (3)
to pass from the OFF position thereof to the ON

position thereof, said lug (11) extends inside said
push-button (3) through a slot (12) formed through said

push-button, characterized in that said centering peg
(22) has a length slightly less than that of said

lug and extends
toward a side

wall (21) of said push-button (3), that said 
resilient spring (20) is coiled on said centering peg

for the overall length thereof and between said
centering peg and said side wall (21) and that said

lug (11) is provided with resilient side legs (13)
which, as the switch is assembled, resiliently yield

to be easily introduced into said slot and then being
spread apart to engage abutments (14) on said push-button (3) so as to

prevent said slider (10) from disengaging.
A switch assembly, according to Claim 1,
characterized in that said lug (11) is provided, at a

free end portion thereof, with a cut-out (30) to
allow said lug (11) to be easily arranged above said

locking element (15) as said push-button (3) is
driven from the ON to the OFF position thereof.
