<ABSTRACT>
The device for printing labels (4) has a printing region (1), a deflection region (10) which is designed as a shaft or as an edge, is arranged following the printing region (1) in the transporting direction (3) of the labels (4), and around which the carrier strip (9) can be guided and where the labels (4) can be detached from the carrier strip (9) owing to their rigidity, the adhesive remaining on the underside (13) of the labels, and additionally a supporting device (12) with a supporting region (14) near to the delivery opening (11) for the labels (4) onto which supporting region the labels (4) delivered via the delivery opening (11) come to rest with their underside (13). In order that the labels (4) do not remain adhering to the supporting region (14) of the supporting device (13) during the delivery, which leads to a considerable impairment of the label delivery, the supporting region (14) of the supporting device (12) is formed by the free surfaces (15) of balls (16) mounted rotatably in at least one holding rail.
