<ABSTRACT>
An iron powder and mixed powder for powder metallurgy as raw materials for producing sintered mechanical components 
by adding Cu powder and graphite powder to iron powder and rolling and sintering the mixture, 0.008 to 0.5 wt.% of at least one 

kind of element selected from elements having a value of oxide standard formation free energy of not greater than 120 kcal/mol 
o₂ at 1,000 °C is contained in the iron powder and not less than 20 % of the element(s) consists of an oxide, while 0.01 to 

0.20 wt.% of at least one kind of oxide powder of an element having a value of oxide standard formation free energy of not 
greater than -120 kcal/mol o₂ at 1,000 °C is blended in the mixed powder. In this way, diffusion of C (carbon) from graphite 

added into iron powder particles is restricted at the time of sintering, and dimensional change accuracy of the sintered 
product is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
Iron powder used for powder metallurgy is
roughly divided into two kinds of pure iron powder and
alloying steel powder.This invention relates to iron powder and mixed
powder for powder metallurgy belonging to the above
former pure iron powder as well as a method of producing
such iron powder.The iron powder for powder metallurgy uses in the
production of a sintered part having usually a density
of 5.0-7.2 g/cm3 by adding and mixing iron powder with
Cu powder, graphite powder and the like, shaping into a
green compact in a mold, sintering and, if necessary,
sizing a sintered body for dimensional correction.However, the sintered body produced by adding Cu
powder, graphite powder or the like to the iron powder
is high in the strength, so that it has a drawback that
the dimensional correction can not be conducted to a 
satisfactory extent due to spring-back of the sintered
body even if the sizing for dimensional correction is
conducted.As a method of ensuring a desired dimensional
accuracy without sizing, therefore, JP-B-56-12304
proposes a technique of enhancing the accuracy of
dimensional change by improving particle size
distribution of starting powder, and JP-A-3-142342
proposes a technique of controlling a given size by
predicting the dimensional change at the sintering from
the shape of powder.However, the iron powder for powder metallurgy
is added with Cu powder, graphite powder, lubricant and
the like, or mixed for the uniformization of properties
in the steps from powder formation to the shaping, or
further transferred for replacement with a new vessel, so
that the properties such as particle size distribution,
shape and the like are apt to be changed at these steps
and also the position change of ingredient due to
segregation of Cu powder or graphite powder added occurs
and consequently the dimensional accuracy can not
necessarily be obtained to a satisfactory extent.The invention is to advantageously solve the
above problems and to provide iron powder and mixed
powder for powder metallurgy capable of providing a 
dense sintered body with a high accuracy by enhancing an
accuracy of dimensional change in the sintering
(concretely green density: about 6.90 g/cm3, scattering
width of dimensional change: within 0.10%, preferably
0.06%) without impairing compressibility as well as a
method of advantageously producing such iron powder.The inventors have made various studies with
respect to the composition of iron powder and the
compounding ratio of additives in order to achieve the
above object and
