<ABSTRACT>
A roller bottle assembly for cell growth culturing of the present invention includes a 
generally cylindrical bottle with a longitudinal axis. The bottle includes a bottom portion, a 

sidewall portion and a top portion which define a hollow chamber. The bottom portion is 
fluidly tightly attached to the sidewall portion at a first end perpendicular to the longitudinal 

axis. The top portion is fluidly tightly attached to the sidewall portion at a second end 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. The top portion includes a provision for introducing 

liquid into the chamber. The sidewall portion has an inner and outer surface, with the inner 
surface having a multiplicity of longitudinal elements integrally formed thereon having 

portions with elevations above and below an average elevation of the surface which serve as 
attachment surfaces for growing cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roller bottle assembly for cell growth production, 
and more particularly relates to a roller bottle with an interior surface which enhances cell 
attachment and growth. Containers used in laboratory settings for cell culturing are commonly known as "roller 
bottles." These roller bottles are generally cylindrical and are adapted to rotate about their 
longitudinal axis when placed on a laboratory roller apparatus. The laboratory roller 
apparatus is often adapted to fit within chambers for controlling the temperature and 
atmosphere. The bottles have evolved into a standard size of about 0.85, 1.75 and 3.5 liters 
capacity and about 11-12 cm. in diameter because of the constraints of the roller apparatus. The most common application for these bottles is to be charged with a few hundred ml 
of growth medium containing a suspension of the cells to be cultured, placed on their sides on 
a roller apparatus so that a longitudinal portion of the inside surface of the bottle is always wet 
by the growth medium, and rotated slowly (about 1-2 rpm) for a number of days. During this 
time, the cells grow and utilize the nutrients present in the growth medium, generally by 
attaching themselves to the surface of the bottle. In many applications, it is necessary to drain 
and recharge the growth medium during the course of the growth cycle, either to harvest by-products, 
remove waste or replenish nutrients. The roller bottles are used in research and in commercial and industrial labs. In most 
of these applications, users are interested in growing large numbers of cells, generally to 
collect cell by-products. Thus anything which will increase the numbers of cells, and enhance 
the yield of the desired product, is a benefit. One solution to the problem would be to simply increase the size of the bottle. 
However, given the general standardization of roller apparatus in the field, this does not 
answer many requirements. Some manufacturers do offer bottles having the same diameter in 
several length versions which reduce the amount of handling when running larger scale 
programs, but these bottles may not fit some apparatus and may present handling problems.  Since in many of the cell growth applications, bottles need to be handled several times 
during the growth cycle, it has been recognized that increasing the inside surface area of the 
bottle, with a concomitant increase in the number of cells, will increase the amount of the 
desired product per amount of space taken up and

portion are fluidly tightly attached to said sidewall portion by a method selected from the 

group consisting of adhesive bonding, solvent bonding, spin welding, ultrasonic welding 
and mechanical interference fitting. 
The roller bottle assembly of claim 1 wherein said bottle is formed from a plastic 
resin. 
The roller bottle assembly of claim 6 wherein said plastic resin is a thermoplastic 
selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyurethane, 

polyvinyl chloride, polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene, polyethyleneterephthalate and 
polyester with said forming including extrusion of said sidewall portion. 
The roller bottle assembly of claim 1 wherein said longitudinal elements include a 

first portion having an elevation above an average surface elevation of said inside surface, 
a second portion having an elevation below said average surface elevation of said inside 

surface, said longitudinal elements further including longitudinal substantially smooth 
transition areas between said first and second portions.
