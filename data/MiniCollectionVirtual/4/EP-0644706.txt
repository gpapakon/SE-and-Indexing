<ABSTRACT>
A horn speaker system includes a dome-shaped 
diaphragm, a coil bobbin, a phase equalizer, and a magnetic 

circuit. The coil bobbin is integral with the dome-shaped 
diaphragm, and a voice coil is wound on the coil bobbin 

near a free end thereof. The magnetic circuit co-acts with 
the voice coil for producing forces to actuate the 

dome-shaped diaphragm. The magnetic circuit includes a 
cylindrical magnet, a first annular yoke attracted to one 

end of the cylindrical magnet and having a central opening, 
a plate cooperating with the first yoke in defining a gap 

in which the coil bobbin is inserted, and a second yoke 
attracted to an opposite end of the magnet. The magnet, 

the first yoke, the first plate, and the second yoke 
jointly make up a closed magnetic circuit. The phase 

equalizer serves to keep sounds outputted from the 
dome-shaped diaphragm in phase. The phase equalizer is 

mounted on the first yoke and has a plurality of slits 
defined therein. The magnet, the first yoke, the phase 

equalizer, and the dome-shaped diaphragm are stacked 
coaxially with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a horn speaker
system, and more particularly to a horn speaker system having
a dome-shaped diaphragm.Horn speaker systems primarily for reproducing
sounds in a high-frequency range have a dome-shaped diaphragm.
The sounds produced by the dome-shaped diaphragm
are collected by a phase equalizer and then introduced into a
horn, from which the sounds are radiated into an exterior
space.The horn speaker system is unable to achieve designed
frequency characteristics unless the magnetic circuit
for actuating the diaphragm is positioned accurately with respect
to the diaphragm. Therefore, the components of the
magnetic circuit, including a magnet, are assembled precisely
with jigs. In particular, it has been customary to define a
gap in which a voice coil is to be disposed, precisely with a
jig called "gap gage" because the width of the gap is very
small. However, it has been tedious and time-consuming to
produce such a gap precisely with the gap gage.Some of the components of the magnetic circuit,
e.g., the magnet, are difficult to fasten with screws due to
their structural limitations. Those components are usually
fixed in place by an adhesive. One problem with the use of
adhesive is that the adhesive applied to bond the components 
tends to block the flow of magnetic fluxes in the magnetic
circuit, resulting in a reduction in the magnetic
efficiency and hence a degradation of the speaker
characteristics.It is important that the diaphragm of a horn speaker
system be reduced in weight for improved speaker
performance, e.g., the quality of reproduced sounds, the
energy conversion efficiency, etc. It is also desired that
the horn speaker systems be capable of reproducing sounds
with as flat a frequency characteristic curve in a wide
frequency range.One form of diaphragm for use in a horn speaker
system is integrally formed with an edge and comprises a
metal sheet. In order to maintain a degree of durability
and rigidity required by the edge, the thickness of the
metal sheet is greater than that of a diaphragm which is
separate from an edge. Therefore, the metal sheet is
relatively heavy, with the result that the horn speaker
system has poor frequency characteristics and response
characteristics.Phase equalizers for use in horn speaker systems can
not keep accurate phase matching unless properly shaped.
In the absence of accurate phase matching, sounds
reproduced by the horn speaker system may be unclear or may
not have a flat frequency characteristic curve. It has
been tedious
