<ABSTRACT>
Here are disclosed method and apparatus for rapidly and 
accurately determining fiber orientation of paper being in a 

standstill or moving in a paper machine and useful for grade study 
and quality control of the paper. The projector means projects an 

unpolarized light beam perpendicularly to a surface of the paper 
to be tested, then a light beam reflected by the paper surface is 

caught by eight or more light receiving means distributed on a 
circumference of circle defined, on the incident side of the 

unpolarized light beam, in a plane extending in parallel to the 
paper surface around a point at which the above-mentioned parallel 

plane intersects an axis of the incident light beam, and a light 
information s
ignals output from these light receiving means are 
subjected to a predetermined arithmetic processing to obtain the 

fiber orientation characteristics such as fiber orientation index 
value and fiber orientation angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method and apparatus
for determining the fiber orientation and particularly to such
method and apparatus suitable for determining the fiber
orientation characteristics of paper being in a process of paper
making.To make paper of high quality, it is essential to
determine paper quality as well as fiber orientation
characteristics of the paper obtained as finished product. Means
for such determination is already well known from, for example,
Japanese patent application Disclosure Gazette No. Hei 4-57983
(1992-57983) disclosing a non-contact orientation meter and
Japanese patent application Disclosure Gazette No. Hei 4-113205
(1992-113205) disclosing a fiber orientation determining
apparatus, both of which utilize incidence and reflection of light
beam on a surface of paper to be tested.A further optical method and apparatus for measuring angular
orientation and uniformity of orientation of fibers is
disclosed in US-A 4 730 931. However said disclosure is
directed to the measurement of fibers within a non-woven web.
According to said teaching, a coherent light beam passes
through the web, whereby said light beam is scattered. The
components of the scattered light are detected by means of a
photodiode detector on the side of the web opposite from the
source of the coherent light beam. From the detected scattered
light components the angular orientation and uniformity of
orientation of the fibers may be calculated.The apparatus disclosed in the above-mentioned
Disclosure Gazette No. 1992-57983 generally comprises the
projector means, the rotatable diaphragm mechanism having the slit
through which the light beam projected from said projector means
is guided and thereby converted to the narrow linear light beam
(i.e., band-like light beam) with the variable longitudinal
direction and the single light receiving means adapted to catch
the band-like light beam which has been incident upon the paper
surface at a predetermined angle and then reflected by the paper  
surface. In view of the fact that the maximum reflection factor
is reached when the longitudinal direction of the band-like light
beam comes in coincidence with the fiber orientation (i.e., fiber
orientation angle), the differential reflection factor with
respect to said band-like light beam having the variable
longitudinal direction is determined to calculate the fiber
orientation index value characterizing the measure of the fiber
orientation.The apparatus disclosed in the above-mentioned
Disclosure Gazette No.
