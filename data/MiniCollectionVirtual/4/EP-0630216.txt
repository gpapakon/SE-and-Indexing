<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive bandage, wound dressing, suture-like mechanism, or surgical drape for use over a wound is made from a laminate structure of flexible rubber, a hydrophilic hydrogel polymer bonded to one side of the flexible rubber, and an adhesive bonded to the hydrophilic hydrogel polymer along at least a first section of the adhesive bandage, wound dressing, suture-like mechanism, or surgical drape. The adhesive is preferably a hydrogel adhesive with a cellulosic, polyurethane or polyacrylate base, while the flexible rubber is preferably rubber which is pretreated with hydrogel polymer prior to curing. A medicament such as CPC or BAK can be bonded to the hydrophilic hydrogel polymer along the non-adhesive portion of the adhesive bandage, wound dressing or surgical drape to provide slow release medication, and if desired, movable plastic may be provided to cover the adhesive portions. In one embodiment, the adhesive bandage (10) is a laminate comprised of a flexible elastomer (15) to which on one side is bonded a hydrogel polymer coating (20). An adhesive (25) is bonded to at least certain sections of hydrogel polymer coating (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to adhesive bandages, wound
dressings and surgical drapes.Adhesive bandages, wound dressings and surgical drapes
have been known in the art for some time. Typically, the
adhesive bandages include a flexible perforated plastic strip,
to which adhesives are bonded on either end of the inside
surface, with the adhesive covered by a self-peeling flat strip
of sheet material. Gauze is typically located in the middle of
the plastic strip between the adhesive sections, with a
perforated plastic covering the gauze and attached to the plastic
strip.Recently, the use of a medicated gauze section as part
of an adhesive bandage has been introduced to the art, where the
adhesive sections of the adhesive bandages are protected by
peelable plastic strips which are removed at the time of use. The
medicated adhesive bandage is applied so that the gauze section
covers the wound area, while the adjoining adhesive sections
maintain contact with the skin around the wound. It has been
found, however, that the adhesive bandages of the art are
troublesome in that the adhesive on the plastic is often a source
of irritant to the skin. The bandage does not flex readily, and
bandage can result in irritation to the covered skin. Moreover,
bandages are often relatively bulky and not easily worn on the
foot or toes.The wound dressings of the art are similar in many
respects to the adhesive bandages, except that often the gauze
section is much larger than that of the adhesive bandage. Also,
typically, more than one plastic adhesive strip is utilized to
keep the wound dressing in place. The wound dressings of the art
not only suffer from the drawbacks inherent in the adhesive
bandages, but they also suffer from the problem of keeping the
wound dressing in place. This is particularly so where the
wound dressing is utilized to cover a joint, and the joint and
skin to which the dressing is applied are subject to movement. The drapes of the art are typically vinyl sheets with
one or more slits therein and are commonly used to help create
a sterile field for surgery. Because of the nature of vinyl
plastics, the drapes of the art do not readily flex in all
directions readily, and consequently cannot lie directly adjacent
to the skin where the skin surface curves unevenly or in more
than one direction. Typically, the drapes of the art do not
utilize adhesive sections at all. Moreover, the drapes of the
art are subject to the penetration of viruses.Among the patent specifications of interest disclosing
bandages,
