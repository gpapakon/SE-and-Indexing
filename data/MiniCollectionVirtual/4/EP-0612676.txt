<ABSTRACT>
This device is of the type supported by a carriage (13) which can move at least vertically and includes a mechanical gripper (3, 6) and means capable of gripping hold of a workpiece (17) from the heap or pile and offering it up between the jaws (3, 6) of the gripper. These means are made up of a member in the form of a corkscrew (19), located vertically and given, on the one hand, a downward movement between the jaws (3, 6) in the open position of the gripper starting from a top end-of-travel position as far as a bottom end-of-travel position, followed by an upward return movement to the top position and, on the other hand, a rotation in the screwing direction, at the end of downward travel, followed by a rotation in the opposite direction, at the end of upward travel, at the same time as the gripper is closed.
