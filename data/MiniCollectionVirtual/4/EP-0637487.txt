<ABSTRACT>
A cartridge for an electric stapler comprises an 
inner cartridge for holding a plurality of staple sheets in 

multi-layered form, each of the stapler sheets being formed 
by sticking straight staples together in sheet-like form, and 

an outer cartridge associated with the inner cartridge and 
detachably mounted on the electric stapler. The outer 

cartridge includes an accommodating section for accommodating 
the inner cartridge, a staple passage formed so as to be 

connected from a lower end of the accommodating section, a 
staple receiving stand disposed at a front end of the staple 

passage, a pusher for pushing frontward legs of a staple 
formed into a square U-shape on the staple receiving stand, 

and a drive section, arranged at the front of the staple 
passage, for receiving the formed staple pushed by the pusher 

and driving the formed staple in a direction orthogonal to 
the staple passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cartridge for an electric stapler 
comprising: an inner cartridge and an outer cartridge 
associated with said inner cartridge which can be detachably 
mounted on the electric stapler, said outer cartridge 
including an accommodating section for accommodating said 
inner cartridge, a staple passage formed so as to be conntected 
from a lower end of said accommodating section and a 
staple receiving stand disposed at a front end of said 
staple passage. According to the first part of independent claim 1, the inner cartridge 
is holding a plurality of staple sheets in multi-layered 
form, each of the staple sheets being formed by sticking 
straight staples together in sheet-like form. According to 
the first part of independent claim 4, the inner cartridge is holding 
a rolled sheet, the rolled sheet being formed by sticking 
straight staples together in rolled form. A cartridge for an electric stapler 
according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 
475 436, 
which discloses therefore the closest prior art to the subject 
matter of claim 1. 
Furthermore, from EP-A-0 446 055, an electric 
stapler 
according to the preamble of claim 4 
is known, wherein the cartridges have a staple 
receiving stand upon which a staple can be formed.  
 As shown in, e.g., Japanese Unexamined Utility Model 
Publication No. Hei, 4-54683, a conventional electric stapler 
is of such a structure as to releasably attach a cartridge to 
an electric stapler main body, the cartridge accommodating a 
plurality of staple sheets in multi-layered form and having a 
pressing spring for pressing the accommodated staple sheets 
downward from the top. The main body includes: a mechanism 
for sequentially feeding the staple sheets within the 
cartridge attached to the main body from the bottommost one; 
a forming means for forming a staple in the front end of the 
fed staple sheet into a square U-shape; and a driving means 
for driving the formed staple toward a material to be 
stapled. Therefore, once all the staple sheets within the 
cartridge have been consumed, the old cartridge is replaced 
with a new cartridge and then scrapped. However, the cartridge main body excluding the stable 
sheets is made of synthetic resin and contains therein the 
metal spring for pressing the staple sheets. Therefore, the 
disposal of the cartridge main body as it is imposes a 
problem in terms of environmental protection.  
 The object of the invention however is to 
provide a cartridge for an electric stapler, which
