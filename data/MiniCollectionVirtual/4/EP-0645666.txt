<ABSTRACT>
A polarizing screen 20 for presenting images in response to receipt 
of imagewise rays of light 22 projected from, for example, a video projector. The 

polarizing screen 20 is made of a woven polarizing fabric 1 which has front and 
rear surfaces D and E opposite to each other and which is woven in a satin fashion 

including warps of one of polarizing and non-polarizing threads 12 and 11 and 
wefts of the other of the polarizing and non-polarizing threads 12 and 11. The 

front surface D of the woven polarizing fabric 1 has a relatively large portion of 
the polarizing threads 12 being exposed therefrom and the rear surface E thereof 

has a relatively large portion of the non-polarizing threads 11 exposed therefrom. 
The polarizing threads 12 of the woven polarizing fabric 1 have their lengthwise 

direction oriented substantially perpendicular to a horizontal plane and, therefore, 
the horizontal viewing angle is increased. Also, the front surface D of the woven 

polarizing fabric 1 where the relatively large portion of the polarizing threads 12 
are exposed is oriented so as to confront the viewers 23 so that the woven 

polarizing fabric 1 can exhibit an enhanced function of a polarizing filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polarizing screen for use with a
video display system equipped with a liquid crystal display device and, more
particularly, to a polarizing screen of a type having a polarizing capability of
selectively transmitting therethrough or reflecting therefrom the incoming light
depending on the direction of polarization.In general, the liquid crystal video display system, that is, the video
display system utilizing a liquid crystal display device, has the following
advantages as compared with a CRT video display system utilizing a cathode ray
tube.
(1) Due to the compact feature, the liquid crystal video display system
can be installed at a relatively small space.(2) Due to the light-weight feature, the liquid crystal video display
system can be transported from place to place easily.(3) Due to the digital images, an image processing is carried out
favorably.However, the conventional liquid crystal video display system
involves an increased amount of loss of light and a low efficiency of utilization of
light. This is because rays of light emitted from a source of light is complicatedly
processed in the following manner. The rays of white light emitted from a light
source made of metal halide is first separated into three light beams of three
primary colors by means of a dichroic mirror. The light beams are projected onto
a liquid crystal light valve after having been converted into linearly polarized light
by means of a linear polarizing element of a light absorbing type. On the other
hand, a voltage modulated with a video signal is applied to the liquid crystal light
valve to rotate the polarizing plane (the plane of electromagnetic vibration) of the 
linearly polarized light so that, as the light projected onto the liquid crystal light
valve passes therethrough and subsequently pass through an analyzer element
(another linear polarizing element), components of rays of light corresponding to
the angle of rotation of the polarizing plane are projected onto a screen to
thereby form a visible image.Accordingly, with the prior art screen used in connection with the
conventional liquid crystal video display system, the contrast of the projected
image is considerably low where the screen is used under the environment with
ambient light such as illuminating light considerably reflecting from the screen
and, therefore, particularly where a screen of a relatively large size is utilized
to present images projected through the liquid crystal video display system,
viewers are required
