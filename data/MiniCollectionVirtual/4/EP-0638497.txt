<ABSTRACT>
A paper conveying apparatus for a sheet-fed 
press includes a shaft (3), a gripper shaft (6), a plurality of 

grippers (8), a gripper pad (17), levers (14), a rod (25), a slide 
member (26), 

rollers (31), and cam plates (32). The shaft (3) has two ends 
pivotally supported by a pair of frames (2). The gripper 

shaft (6) extends parallel to the shaft (3) and swings upon 
pivotal movement of the shaft (3). The plurality of 

grippers (8) are aligned on the gripper shaft (6). The gripper 
pad (17) extends to be parallel to the gripper shaft (6) and 

swings upon pivotal movement of the shaft (3). The grippers (8) 
and the gripper pad grip (17) the end portion of a sheet (35) 

conveyed from upstream a paper conveying direction by 
cooperation thereof, and convey the sheet (35) to a cylinder 

downstream the paper conveying direction. The levers (14), 
the rod (25), the slide member (26), the rollers (31), and the cam 

plates (32) reciprocally move in the axial direction of the 
shaft (3) to flex the central portions of the gripper pad (17) 

and gripper shaft (6) in the paper conveying direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper conveying apparatus 
of a sheet-fed press according to the preamble of claim 
1 . Such a paper conveying apparatus for a sheet-fed press is 
known from EP-A-0 372 237 . Generally, in a paper conveying apparatus of this type, 
sheets are drawn and conveyed by suction one by one by the 
suction port of a sucker unit from a paper feed unit. Each 
sheet is then fed onto a feeder board by rotation of a paper 
feed roller, and conveyed on the feeder board toward a 
feed board by a paper feed tape or the like. When the sheet 
is fed onto the feed board, its leading end is aligned by a 
registration, and the sheet is gripped by, e.g., the grippers 
of a swingable swing unit. Then, the sheet is conveyed 
to the cylinder of the printing press by the pivotal movement 
of the swing unit, and re-gripped by the grippers of 
the cylinder. In the paper conveying apparatus of this type, the trailing 
side of the paper expands or shrinks in the right-to-left 
direction due to water and a large pressure which are applied 
when the sheet is subjected to printing.When this expansion 
or shrinkage occurs,misregistration occurs in printing 
registration called fan-out registration at the trailing 
side of the paper during multi-color printing, to cause 
defective printing. The structure of the paper conveying apparatus for a sheet-fed 
press according to the EP-A-0 372 237 is effecting the 
gripper shaft and the gripper pad bend by hitting a stopper  
 
screw,which is fixed to the frame at the sheet gripping position. 
Therefore, a shock is effected which could be the 
reason for vibrations and a noise; as a result of this the 
durability of the paper conveying apparatus could become a 
problem. Further the gripper shaft bends in a different direction 
in relation to the sheet forwarding direction and 
the central portion of the gripper shaft bends either upward 
or downward compared with the point of sheet forwarding 
with respect to the shaft. It is an object of the present invention to provide a paper 
conveying apparatus for a sheet-fed press as mentioned at 
the beginning, in which fan-out registration is corrected 
to improve its precision. It is an another object of the present invention to provide 
a paper conveying apparatus for a sheet-fed press of the 
mentioned type, in which fan-out registration can be adjusted 
even during operation of the printing press. In order to achieve the above objects,according to the present 
invention the paper conveying apparatus for a

shaft (3); 
a plurality of grippers (8) aligned on said gripper 
shaft (6); 
a gripper pad (17) which extends to be parallel to 
said gripper shaft (6) and swings upon pivotal movement 

of said shaft (3); 
said grippers (8) and said gripper pad (17) gripping 
an end portion of a sheet (35), which is conveyed from 

upstream a paper conveying direction, by cooperation 
thereof and conveying the sheet to a cylinder (37) 

downstream the paper conveying direction, 
characterized in
 that
 
displacing means (14, 25, 26, 31, 32) are provided 

which reciprocally move in an axial direction of said 
shaft (3) to flex central portions of said gripper 

pad (17) and said gripper shaft (6) in the paper conveying 
direction and are constituted by a pivot member 

(14) pivotally supported by said shaft (3) and coupled 
to the substantially central portions of the gripper 

pad (17) and said gripper shaft (6), each having the two 
ends respectively pivotally supported by one of a pair  

 
of support levers (5), fixed to said shaft (3) for fixing 

and supporting two ends of said gripper pad (17),
