<ABSTRACT>
A transportable animal enclosure (10) assembly including opposed longitudinal sidewall assemblies each having a respective upper portion adapted to constrain sideways movement of the upper body portion of an animal being transported and a base assembly extending between and laterally beyond said upper portions and being accessible to the animal being transported. One or both sidewall assemblies preferably include a lower portion (20) disposed outwardly from the or each respective upper portion and extending towards the base wall and preferably the lower portion (20) slopes inwardly from the base wall to the upper portion. The transportable animal enclosure (10) preferably includes adjustable rear support means (22) for supporting the rump of the animal and adjustable chest restraining means for restraining the animal against the rear support means (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transportable animal 
enclosures. This invention has particular but not exclusive 
application to improvements to animal enclosures for horses, 
such enclosures being in the form of trailers and the like 
towed by a vehicle and for illustrative purposes reference 
will be made to such application. However, it is to be 
understood that this invention could be used in other 
applications, such as for other animal transportation sudh as 
trucks and/or semi-trailers, rail mounted carriages, aircraft 
or shipping containers and such like or for non-equine 
animals and such like. Transportable animal enclosures, including horse floats, 
generally comprise a space to accommodate an animal and 
include transportation means which may be either formed 
integrally with, or connectable to, the accommodation space. 
The animal accommodation space is usually made to conform to 
the larger or basic dimensions of the animal with an 
additional surrounding space to allow for comfort and ease of 
use for the animal. In horse floats the accommodation space 
is normally in the form of a box having a rounded top and/or 
front end, a gate pivoted about its bottom edge as a back 
wall. The accommodation space further includes substantially 
vertical sides spaced apart slightly greater than the body 
width or thickness of a horse. The gate is usually pivotable 
from a closed position where it forms the back wall of the 
accommodation means to an open position where it forms a ramp 
permitting an animal to conveniently enter and exit the 
animal enclosure. See for instance US-A-3 053 224 or US-A-4 355 594 Whilst such enclosures are generally satisfactory, an 
animal may be injured during transit due to direction 
changes. When cornering, for example, the animal may attempt 
to climb the side walls and may stumble and fall to the 
floor. Intuitively, some animals have a tendency to crouch 
down on their hind legs, which in combination with wall  
 
climbing may cause scramble and/or fall injuries to the 
animal. It will be appreciated that this invention is not limited 
to jument, sumpter-beasts or other beasts of burden, and may 
be applied to the transport of other animals which are prone 
to the abovementioned difficulties, such as zoo animals, farm 
animals and such like. The present invention aims to alleviate one or more of 
the above disadvantages and to provide a transportable animal 
enclosure which will be reliable and efficient in use. With the foregoing in view, this invention in one aspect

<CLAIMS>
A transportable animal enclosure assembly (10) including:- 

opposed longitudinal side wall assemblies each having a 
respective upper portion (11) adapted to constrain sideways 

movement of the upper body portion of an animal (17) being 
transported, and 
a base wall assembly (20, 30, 31, 32) extending laterally 
beyond said upper portions (11) and being accessible to the animal (16) 

being transported. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein one or both said side wall assemblies include a lower 

portion (20) disposed outwardly from the respective said upper 
portion (11) and extending towards said base wall. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein said lower portion (30, 31) slopes inwardly from said base 

wall to said upper portion. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, and including rear support means (22), for 

supporting the rump of an animal (17) and a chest restraining 
means (23), for restraining the animal against said rear support 

means. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in claim 4, 
wherein said chest restraining means (23) and/or said rear support 

means (22) are adjustable to encourage an animal to substantially 
support itself upon said rear support means. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in claim 4 or 
claim 5, wherein said rear support means (22) is in the form of a 

height adjustable bar (26) and said chest restraining means is in 
the form of a chest bar (33 - 35) adjustable towards or away from said 

height adjustable bar.  
 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, and including a top wall extending 

across said side wall assemblies, a front wall extending 
upwardly from the base wall an between said side wall 

assemblies, and a hinged rear wall (21) pivotable about a lower 
edge from a closed attitude where said hinged rear wall 

encloses the transportable animal enclosure and an open 
attitude where said hinged rear wall opens to form an opening 

and an access ramp which tapers away from said animal 
enclosure. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein said opposed longitudinal side 

wall assemblies are spaced apart to accommodate two animals (17) 
for transport. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed claim 8, and 
including partition means (25) for separating each animal and/or 

constraining sideways movement of the upper body portion of 
the or each animal being transported. 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the animal enclosure is mounted 

on carriage means (12 - 15). 
A transportable animal enclosure as claimed in claim 10, 
wherein said carriage means is in the form of a vehicle 

trailer (12 - 15). 
A method of enclosing an animal for transport, said 
method including:- 


providing an animal enclosure as claimed in any one 
claims 4 to 11; 
placing an animal in the animal enclosure;  
 
adjusting the rear support means to suit the rear of the 
animal, and 
adjusting the chest restraining means to suit the chest 
of the animal.
