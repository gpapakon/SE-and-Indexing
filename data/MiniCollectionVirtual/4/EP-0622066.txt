comprising a bath tub (2), and a seat (3) for a user 

which seat is movable between a lower, bathing position 
and an upper position for the user to mount and 

dismount, wherein the seat (3) is tiltable between a 
generally upright mode for use when in the upper 

position for mounting and dismounting and a reclined 
mode for use when in the lower position for bathing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to baths. It is known from British Patent No. 2222767 to 
provide a bath for disabled people provided at one end 
with a seat which is movable between a lower, bathing 
position within the bath tub and an upper position from 
which it is turnable sideways for the user to mount and 
dismount. With this bath the user sits generally 
upright on the seat so that only the lower half of the 
user's body is immersed in water when in the bathing 
position. In order to achieve greater immersion the 
user needs to slide forwardly on the seat but this is 
not always possible. Even if it is possible the user 
may not feel secure if he or she slides forward, in view 
of the difficulty of returning to the upright position. It is also known from FR-A-2332004 to provide a 
bath having at one end a seat mounted on a support 
movable between an upper, mounting position and a lower, 
bathing position. According to this document, the seat 
is connected to the support via a pivoting joint below 
the seat which allows the seat to swivel about a 
vertical axis and tilt about a horizontal axis. This 
tiling allows the front edge of the seat to be lowered 
to ease mounting by the user. In GB-A-2120933, there is disclosed a bath for use 
by elderly or disabled persons, comprising: a bath tub; 
a seat for a user which seat has a bottom part and is 
movable between a lower, bathing position and an upper 
position for the user to mount and dismount; and 
engaging means engageable by the seat during downward 
movement thereof to cause the seat to tilt during such 
downward movement. The present invention is characterised over GB-A-2120933 
in that said seat is tiltable between a 
generally upright mode for use when in the upper  
 
position for mounting and dismounting and a reclined 
mode for use when in the lower position for bathing, in 
which reclined mode the bottom part of said seat is 
inclined upwardly in the forward direction relative to 
the horizontal. With such an arrangement the user can mount the 
seat when it is in the upright mode, but when bathing 
the user is reclined so as to achieve greater immersion 
than would be available if the seat remained in the 
upright mode. It is not necessary for the user to slide 
forwardly on the seat to achieve this immersion, thereby 
assisting the user to feel secure whilst bathing. The seat may be arranged to move between the lower 
and upper positions at an angle to the vertical and may 
for example follow a curved path of movement to achieve 
tilting,

A bath (1) for use by elderly or disabled persons, 
comprising: a bath tub (2); a seat (3) for a user which 

seat has a bottom part (4) and is movable between a 
lower, bathing position and an upper position for the 

user to mount and dismount; and engaging means (15) 
engageable by the seat (3) during downward movement 

thereof to cause the seat to tilt during such downward 
movement; characterised in that said seat (3) is 

tiltable between a generally upright mode for use when 
in the upper position for mounting and dismounting and a 

reclined mode for use when in the lower position for 
bathing, in which reclined mode the bottom part (4) of 

said seat (3) is inclined upwardly in the forward 
direction relative to the horizontal.

horizontal pivot axis (11) is positioned intermediate 

the top of the substantially vertically movable support 
means (6) and the bottom part (4) of the seat (3).
