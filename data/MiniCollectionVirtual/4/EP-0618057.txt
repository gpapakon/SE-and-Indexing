<ABSTRACT>
In resin transfer moulding, the resin is heated immediately 
before 
it is introduced into the mould to a temperature 
which is below the temperature at which curing of the resin 

will begin. Microwave heating is a particularly suitable 
mechanism for providing this heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to resin transfer moulding and in 
particular to an apparatus for resin transfer moulding as 
well as to a method of resin transfer moulding. In resin transfer moulding (RTM) a fibrous reinforcement is 
placed in a mould cavity and the mould is closed. Liquid 
resin is then injected into the mould cavity so that it 
flows through the reinforcement to wet the reinforcement 
thoroughly. The resin is then allowed to cure and after 
cure the moulded product is ejected from the mould. It is possible to produce quite complex moulded products in 
this way. The reinforcement can be formed to provide 
necessary strength in areas where strength is required, 
because the reinforcement can be "designed" independently of 
the moulding process. For RTM to become a viable process for use in mass 
production of articles, it is desirable to minimise the 
cycle time, i.e. the time from ejection of one product from 
the mould to ejection of the following product from the same 
mould. There are many factors which can affect the cycle 
time. A method of resin transfer moulding is described in the 
journal Composites Manufacturing, Vol.3, No.4, 1992 at pp 
235-249. In this document resin preheating is discussed 
(p.241) and associated problems are pointed out. This 
document does also disclose the use of a domestic microwave 
oven (p.246) as a possible technique for preheating batches 
of resin, but such a technique cannot be used for heating a 
continuous stream of resin.  
 JP-A-60 007 136 describes a process for encapsulating 
semiconductor components where solid resin pellets are 
preheated by microwave energy before they are heated again 
to liquefy the resin and are then pressed into a mould 
cavity. According to the present invention, there is provided 
apparatus for resin transfer moulding, the apparatus 
comprising a mould, means for heating the mould, a reservoir 
for containing liquid resin mixed with catalyst at a 
temperature below the catalyst activation temperature, and 
a pipe through which resin can flow in a continuous stream 
from the reservoir to the mould, characterised in that 
microwave heating means is arranged to heat the resin 
flowing along the pipe, immediately before the resin enters 
the mould, so that more heat energy is imparted to the resin 
at the centre of the pipe than to the resin near to the 
walls of the pipe. The invention also provides a method of resin transfer 
moulding in which liquid catalysed resin flows in a 
continuous stream into a mould, characterised

<CLAIMS>
A method of resin transfer moulding in which liquid 
catalysed resin flows in a continuous stream into a mould 

(24), characterised in that the catalysed resin is heated 
by microwave heating to a temperature above the resin 

storage temperature but below the catalyst activation 
temperature in a microwave mode which heats the centre of 

the flowing resin preferentially to the edges of the 
stream, immediately before the resin enters the mould. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
microwave mode is a TM
020
 mode. 
Apparatus for resin transfer moulding, the apparatus 
comprising a mould (24), means for heating the mould, a 

reservoir (36) for containing liquid resin mixed with 
catalyst at a temperature below the catalyst activation 

temperature, and a pipe (42) through which resin can flow 
in a continuous stream from the reservoir to the mould, 

characterised in that microwave heating means (48) is 
arranged to heat the resin flowing along the pipe (42), 

immediately before the resin enters the mould (24), so 
that more heat energy is imparted to the resin at the 

centre of the pipe than to the resin near to the walls of 
the pipe. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the 
microwaves are conveyed to an applicator (54) where they 

operate in a TM
020
 mode. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the 
applicator (54) takes the form of a cylindrical housing 

through which a cylindrical resin-carrying chamber (72) 
extends.  

 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the 
cylindrical chamber (72) has walls which are transparent 

to microwaves. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the chamber 
walls are of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 7, 
wherein the diameter of the cylindrical chamber (72) is 

larger than the diameter of the tubular pipe (42) through 
which the resin flows into the chamber (72). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 4 to 8, 
wherein microwaves are introduced to the applicator (54) 

from a waveguide (52), and the interface between the 
waveguide and the applicator includes a window (86), the 

size of which can be varied.
