<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a massage apparatus 10 for rolling massage of skin and reflex zones of the human body, in which a wheel shaft 24 which is located in arch shape on a handle is provided with massage rings or rolling bodies 26 mounted thereon so as to be freely rotatable. These massage rings or rolling bodies are each provided with projections 28 which are evenly distributed in the circumferential direction and are preferably made of needle tips. In order to ensure an optimum massaging effect the invention proposes that the wheel shaft 24 carrying the massage rings or rolling bodies 26 be mounted with the handle 12 in a connection 30, 32, 34, 36 which is resilient at least to a limited extent transversely to its longitudinal direction.

<CLAIMS>
Massager for roller massage of skin and reflex zones on the human
body


in which an axle (24) fitted on a handle (12 or 102 respectively) is
equipped with massage rings or roller bodies (26) mounted freely

rotatably on it,
in which the massage rings or roller bodies (26) each have
projections (28) arranged uniformly distributed in peripheral

direction,
which projections consist preferably of needle points,
and in which the axle (24) bearing massage rings or roller bodies
(26) is located to the side of the handle (12 or 102 respectively) in

a forked element (20), which forked element is movably
connected with the handle and is mounted in a laterally open

pocket (16) of same,
characterized in that
the forked element (20) is held in the pocket (16) by means of
longitudinal slots (32) interspersed with bolts (30),
and, by means of this mounting, is in a limitedly elastically resilient
supporting connection (30, 32, 34 or 36 or 38 respectively)

transversely to its longitudinal direction with the handle (12 or 102
respectively),
and that this supporting connection (30, 32, 34 or 36 or 38
respectively) is formed by at least one spring (38 or 34

respectively), e.g. laminated spring band (38) or helical pressure
spring (34), supported at one end on the forked element (20) and

at the other end on the handle (12) - inside the pocket (16).
Massager for roller massage of skin and reflex zones on the human
body


in which an axle (24) fitted on a handle (12 or 102 respectively) is
equipped with massage rings or roller bodies (26) mounted freely

rotatably on it,
in which the massage rings or roller bodies (26) each have
projections (28) arranged uniformly distributed in peripheral

direction,
which projections consist preferably of needle points,
and in which the axle bearing massage rings or roller bodies (26)
is located to the side of the handle (12 or 102 respectively) in a

forked element (20), which forked element is movably

pocket (16) of same,
characterized in that
the forked element (20) is held in the pocket (16) by means of
longitudinal slots (32) interspersed with bolts (30),
by means of this mounting, the forked element is in a limitedly
elastically resilient supporting connection (30, 32, 34 or 36 or 38

respectively) transversely to its longitudinal direction with the
handle (12 or 102 respectively),
and that this supporting connection is formed by at least one
elastomer block (36) supported at one end on the forked

element (20) and at the other end on the handle (12 or 102
respectively) - inside the pocket (16).
Massager according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that

at least two forked elements (20) with massage rings or roller bodies
respectively (26) are positioned consecutively in longitudinal direction

of the handle (12) in laterally open pockets (16) and are each held
movably independent of each other by means of longitudinal slots

(32) interspersed with bolts (30).
