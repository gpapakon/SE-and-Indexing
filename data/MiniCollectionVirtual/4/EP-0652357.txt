<ABSTRACT>
An electronic engine controller (EEC) is utilised to 
perform an on-board diagnostic test of a catalytic converter 

(32). 
An upstream oxygen sensor (60) detects the exhaust 

gas entering the catalytic converter (32) and an downstream 
oxygen sensor (70) detects the exhaust gas exiting the 

catalytic converter (32). An air/fuel mixture is maintained 
at a first bias level until the exhaust gas produced by 

combustion of the air/fuel mixture is detected by the 
downstream oxygen sensor (70) at which point the air/fuel 

mixture is altered to a second bias level and maintained at 
the second bias level until the exhaust gas produced by 

combustion of the air/fuel mixture is detected by the 
downstream oxygen sensor (70). An amount of time required 

for the upstream oxygen sensor (60) to detect the exhaust 
products of the first bias value and for the second bias 

value is calculated, and similar values are calculated for 
the downstream oxygen sensor (70). The EEC (100) calculates 

a converter storage capacity value as a function of the 
first bias level and the first and second time durations and 

the second bias level and accompanying time durations, and 
is then compared against a predetermined minimum converter 

capacity value. If the converter storage capacity is less 
than or equal to the predetermined minimum converter 

capacity value then a converter inoperative condition is 
set.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
determining the efficacy of catalytic converters,- and more 
particularly, although in its broader aspects not 
exclusively, to the on-board determination of catalytic 
converter efficacy. Modern motor vehicle engines typically utilise a 
catalytic converter to reduce the exhaust gas emissions 
produced by the engine. Such converters operate to 
chemically alter the exhaust gas composition produced by the 
engine to help meet various environmental regulations 
governing tailpipe emissions. When operating properly, 
modern catalytic converters can significantly reduce the 
concentration of several undesirable components of exhaust 
gases. Governmental regulations are imposing increasingly 
stringent standards for the efficacy of catalytic 
converters. Known methods for determining the efficacy of 
catalytic converters often have one or more of a variety of 
shortcomings, including being unable to quantify the 
efficacy of the converter, and causing unwanted side effects 
such as engine surge during efficacy testing, producing 
exhaust gases containing components of sufficient 
concentration to contribute to catalyst degradation, and 
emitting exhaust gases which exceed normal allowable levels. Accordingly, there is a need for a catalytic 
converter testing method and system which provides an 
accurate, quantifiable measure of catalytic converter 
efficacy without producing the aforesaid unwanted side-effects.  
 DE-A 41 01 616 relates to an apparatus for determining 
catalytic converter efficacy in which oxygen sensors are 
disposed at locations upstream and downstream of the catalyst 
and the efficacy is detected on the basis of response delay 
times of the oxygen sensors, and describes such apparatus in 
which the delay times are measured during operation of the 
engine two different predetermined operating states, in order 
to detect the catalyst efficacy independently of the respective 
characteristics of the upstream and downstream oxygen sensors. 
However, no provision is made for control of the operation or 
of the air/fuel ratios used. According to the present invention, a system and method 
for testing the catalytic converter for processing an exhaust 
gas produced from the combustion of an air/fuel mixture within 
an internal combustion engine, as set forth in claims 1 and 
5 respectively, in which the air/fuel ratio is controlled.  
 An advantage of at least certain preferred 
embodiments is that a quantifiable determination is made as 
to
