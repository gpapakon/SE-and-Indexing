<ABSTRACT>
Corrosion inhibitor for a metallic material such as steel, of the type consisting of an aqueous solution containing an alkali metal nitrite, characterised in that the said solution contains 0.01 to 0.3 mol/l of an alkali metal nitrite, 0.01 to 0.3 mol/l of an alkali metal phosphate and phosphoric acid in the proportion of a quantity sufficient to maintain the pH of the said solution, measured at ambient temperature, between 6.9 and 7.2.

<CLAIMS>
Process of anticorrosion protection of a sheet
of steel which has been precoated on one of its faces

with a Zn-Ni alloy, characterized in that, while the
sheet is travelling through, a layer of an inhibitor is

deposited on at least one face of the said sheet, this
inhibitor consisting of an aqueous solution containing

0.01 to 0.3 mol/l of an alkali metal nitrite, 0.01 to
0.3 mol/l of a tertiary orthophosphate of an alkali

metal, and orthophosphoric acid in an amount which is
sufficient to keep the pH of the said solution, measured

at ambient temperature, between 6.9 and 7.2, the said
layer containing 2 to 6 mg/m
2
 of the said alkali metal
calculated as sodium, and in that drying of the said

layer is then carried out, followed by oiling and
winding of the said sheet.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the molar concentrations of alkali metal ions of

the nitrite and of the tertiary orthophosphate do not
differ by more than 15 %.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the said solution also contains a wetting agent.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the said wetting agent is a

nonionic or anionic wetting agent.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the said aqueous solution also

contains a foam-suppressing agent.
