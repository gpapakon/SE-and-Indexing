<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming, and an arrangement for using 
arbitrary angle mirrors in substrates is disclosed. An 

erodible material, such as a photoresist, is applied to a 
substrate at a site and is exposed to radiation at that 

site which has a linear variation in energy at the surface 
of the erodible material. Due to this variation 
in 
exposure energy, a taper results in the erodible material 

after development. The tapered region is then etched in a 
manner which etches both the erodible layer and the 

underlying substrate. The taper in the erodible layer 
provides a varying attenuation during the etching process 

such that the taper of the erodible layer, or a multiple 
of it, is transferred to the substrate. In a first 

embodiment, a tapered reflective surface is formed in a 
substrate, which surface engages an optical signal and 

deflects it to an optical device or another surface. In a 
second embodiment, two tapered reflective surfaces are 

formed in a substrate and oriented to deflect incident 
light to a modulation device. In a third embodiment, an 

arrangement for modulating a light signal is formed by two 
tapered reflective surfaces. The surfaces are oriented to 

form a vee groove in a substrate and are coated with an 
active semiconductor device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hybrid electronic/optic 
systems and more particularly to the formation of angled 
surfaces in a substrate which alter the path of optical 
signals. Angled mirrored surfaces are of great utility in 
optic systems. For example, surface emitting lasers 
(SELs) with an integrated 45° micromirror can be used to 
support a variety of applications including neural 
networks, optical interconnects and optoelectronic 
integrated circuits. The 45° mirror is used to deflect 
light from its path in the plane of the laser cavity to an 
optical path normal to the plane for optical engagement 
with other devices. The 45° mirrors of the prior art are typically formed 
by an ion milling technique. According to this method, a 
photoresist is applied to a substrate and exposed at the 
intended site for the mirror. The photoresist is applied 
so that other features present on the substrate will not 
be affected by subsequent processing steps. The 
photoresist is subsequently developed to create an opening 
at the site. The substrate is then fixed on a tilting 
table and held at the angle which is to be imparted to the 
surface which will form the mirror. In the case mentioned 
above, that angle is 45°. An ion beam of sufficient 
energy to erode the material is then focussed and directed 
at the surface such that a deep groove is formed in the 
substrate. The photoresist, now hardened from previous 
processing steps, must be stripped off and the surface of  
 
the substrate cleaned. To expose the angled surface 
created by exposure to the ion beam, a wedge of material 
must be removed from the substrate. To accomplish this, a 
second groove is formed in the substrate which will 
intersect with the first groove. However, photoresist 
must first be reapplied to protect the groove previously 
formed by the ion beam, exposed and developed to create a 
second opening at the surface of the substrate. The 
substrate is then positioned normal to the beam and the 
second groove is formed. As noted above, the two grooves 
intersect such that a wedge of material is released from 
the substrate resulting in an angled surface on the 
substrate. Thus, the ion milling technique is 
complicated, requiring separate photolithographic steps 
for each exposure to the ion beam. A second technique for forming angled surfaces for 
various applications is known as crystallographic 
dependent etching. In this method, the difference in etch 
rates of the <100> and <111> crystalline planes of silicon 
is utilized to create

A method of forming an angled reflective surface in a substrate for 
deflecting an in plane optical signal out of plane comprising the steps of: 


(a) applying a layer of erodible material to a site on the substrate; 
(b) exposing the erodible material, at the site, to radiation which has an 
energy variation at the surface of the erodible material; and 
(c) etching the erodible material and substrate at the site so that a first 
angled surface is formed in the substrate at the site, where the first angled surface is 

configured to receive an optical signal propagating along an optical path in the plane 
of the substrate. 
The method of claim 1 where the energy variation at the surface of the 
erodible material is generated using techniques selected from the group consisting of 

using a halftone photomask, using a photomask with a linearly graded region, using 
the scanned slit method, and using E-beam lithography.

reflective surface on the substrate having the same angle relative to unetched 

substrate. 
The method of claim 4 further comprising: 

(a) exposing the first angled reflective surface to light propagating along 
a first optical path; and 
(b) deflecting light off the first angled reflective surface along a second 
optical path to optically engage a modulation device, which device, in a first state, 

reflects a substantial portion of the light incident upon the device, which reflected 

light follows a third optical path to the second angled reflective surface and is then 
further deflected to a fourth optical path; in a second state, the modulation device 

absorbs a substantial portion of the light incident upon the device; wherein 
   the first and second angled reflective surfaces are oriented so that the 

intersection of the first optical path with the second optical path describes a non-zero

coincidence between the second and third optical path is at the point of reflection at 
 

the modulation device.
