A method of coating an adhesive polymer comprising hot-melt coating a composition of a hydrophobic adhesive polymer and a transient polar processing aid onto a substrate is provided. In addition, a method of coating a hydrophobic adhesive polymer when contacted with a transient polar processing aid, and a hot-melt coatable adhesive composition are also provided. These methods provide clear, smooth, and foam-free coatings, that are also substantially free of high temperature, low temperature, and processing aid-induced coating defects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of hot-melt coating adhesive polymers, and in
particular, pressure-sensitive adhesive polymers, using processing aids.The coating of adhesive polymers, including pressure-sensitive adhesives, such
as rubber-based materials, onto suitable backings is well-known in the art. Typically, these
adhesive polymers are formed by solution or emulsion polymerization techniques.
Thereafter, the resultant adhesive polymers are coated either directly from their reaction
medium, or subsequent to isolation and dissolution, onto a substrate. See e.g., D. Satas,
Ed., "Handbook of Pressure Sensitive Adhesive Technology," Van Nostrand, New York,
Chapter 13, pg. 298 (1982).Over the past several years, research has focused upon the production of
adhesive polymers through solvent-free polymerization techniques. For example, U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,833,179, and 4,952,650 disclose the production of acrylate-based pressure-sensitive
adhesive copolymers in an aqueous medium via suspension polymerization techniques.
However, to date, these adhesives are isolated from the aqueous medium, dissolved in an
organic solvent, and coated therefrom onto a suitable substrate, such as a tape backing
material. Thus, while organic solvents can be eliminated as a reaction medium for the
polymerization of many adhesive polymers, they are still typically used to coat these adhesive
materials.A number of problems arise from the use of organic solvents as coating
media. Most useful organic solvents are flammable, and thus, can pose a safety hazard, both
during and after coating. Also, the relatively high cost of organic solvents can substantially
increase the final cost of the adhesive-coated product. Finally, the organic solvents must be
removed from the coated adhesive, typically by evaporative drying, after coating. This
subsequent removal of organic solvents results in additional energy and equipment costs, and
poses safety and environmental disposal problems.In an effort to overcome the problems associated with organic solvent-coated
adhesives, hot-melt extrusion coating of adhesive polymers has been employed. In theory,
hot-melt extrusion coating of a dry adhesive polymer from the melt state should provide
numerous advantages, including elimination of unwanted organic solvents, and nearly an
instantaneous bonding of the hot adhesive to a suitable substrate. However, in practice,
useful hot-melt coating can be difficult to achieve, particularly where odor-free adhesive
coatings, such as in the medical field, are
