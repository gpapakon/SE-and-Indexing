Process to reduce vibrations caused by load 
impulses in speed-controlled drives having a mechanical 

arrangement (1 - 9) capable of vibrating, in which a 
load compensation (30, 31) is provided, which upon load 

impulses engages in a reducing manner into the speed 
control (20) of the drive (1, 2) and in this way 

effects a vibration absorption, characterized in that 
with the load compensation static load parts are 

filtered out (31) and in that in addition to the load 
compensation (30, 31) a jerk compensation (35) acts on 

the speed control (20). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the load compensation (30, 31) is reduced by a 

load part which is directly proportional to 
accelerations (a*) due to changes of the desired speed 

value (v*) of the speed control (20). 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the desired speed value (v*) is specified for the 

speed control (20) from an acceleration rate limiter 
(26) which contains means (23, 24) to limit the 

acceleration (a*), and in that the acceleration value 
(a*) which can be taken from the acceleration rate 

limiter (26) is used to form the acceleration-proportional 
load part (29). 
Process according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the acceleration rate 

limiter (26) contains means (27, 28) to limit the jerk 
(r*), i.e. the change of the acceleration (a*), and in 

that the value for the jerk (r*) which can be taken 
from the acceleration rate limiter (26) is used for the 

jerk loading of the speed control (20). 
Process according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that with several drives (1, 

2) for the mechanical arrangement these drives (1, 2) 
are controlled in parallel from the speed control (20)  

 
and in that the load c
ompensation takes place for all 
drives (1, 2) together. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that with several drives (1, 2) for 

the mechanical arrangement the desired torque value 
(M*) produced by the speed control (20) is apportioned 

differently to the individual drives (1, 2) (36), 
whereby the individual drives (1, 2) are braced. 
Arrangement to reduce vibrations caused by 
load impulses in speed-controlled drives having a 

mechanical arrangement (1 - 9) capable of vibrating, 
with a device for load compensation (30, 31) which upon 

load impulses engages in a reducing manner into the 
speed control (20) of the drive (1, 2) and in this way 

effects a vibration absorption, characterized in that 
the device (30, 31) for the load compensation contains 

a device (31) to filter out static load parts and in 
that a device (35) for jerk compensation is provided, 

which in addition to the load compensation (30, 31) 
acts on the speed control (20).
