<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a polypeptide represented by 
the following amino acid sequence: 


wherein n is 0 or 1 and X represents 

or a fragment thereof (n=0: SEQ ID 
NO:1, n=1: SEQ ID NO:2), a recombinant DNA coding for the 

polypeptide, a vector containing the recombinant DNA, the 
preparation of a transformant carrying the vector, and the 

production of the polypeptide with the transformant. 
The invention also provides a method for promoting an  

 
increase in the number of platelets in a mammal using a 

polypeptide having a heparin binding secretory transforming 
factor 2 (hst-2) activity. 
The polypeptide can be produced in large amounts, and 
has hst-2 activity, so that it can be advantageously used 

as drugs for promoting treatment of burns, wounds, etc., 
and therapeutic agents for gastrointestinal ulcers. 

Further, it can be utilized as platelet-increasing agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of polypeptide having a heparin-binding
secretory transforming factor 2 acitivity (hereinafter also briefly
referred to as hst-2 in this specification) such as growth promoting activity
on animal cells for preparing a medicament for treating thrombocytopenic
symptoms in a mammal.Groups of cell growth factors belonging to the
heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF) family show homology
with one another on amino acid sequences and are commonly
characterized by strong heparin-binding activity. The cell
growth factors belonging to this family include acidic and
basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF), hst-1,
INT2, FGF5 and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). Of these
cell growth factors, there is a report that FGF has
activity on various cells and particularly has growth
promoting activity and differentiation promoting activity
on mesodermal cells [Gospodarowicz et al., J. Cell.
Physiol., supplt., 5, 15 (1987)]. FGF has also been
investigated for application to drugs for promoting wound 
healing, or repair of the cardiac muscle or the nervous
tissue after ischemia.An hst-1 gene is a transforming gene identified by a
focus forming method, and a product thereof has cell growth
promoting activity and angiogenesis inducing activity in
vivo (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-218398:
European Patent Publication No.421455) as well as FGF. An
hst-2 gene was identified as a gene having high homology
with the hst-1 gene by a DNA blot hybridization method
[Sakamoto et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,151, 965
(1988)]. The same gene was also reported as an FGF6 gene
[Marics I. et al., Oncogene, 4, 335(1989) and Coulier F. et
al., Oncogene 6(4), 1433(1991)]. They also report that the
FGF6 gene codes three in frame ATG codons which are able to
initiate the translation of three peptides of 175, 198 and
208 residues. Further, hst-2 was considered by the present
inventors to actually have biological activity and to be a
novel growth factor belonging to the HST family, because
hst-2 gene-introduced fibroblasts formed tumors on nude
mice [Naito et al., Jpn. J. Cancer Res. Abstr., 500
(1989)]. Products of the hst-2 genes have therefore also
been expected to be applicable to drugs as promoters for
wound healing , or repair of the cardiac muscle after
cardiac ischemia and the nervous tissue after brain
ischemia.In order to promote the investigation of the hst-2
protein, it is necessary to obtain the protein in large 
amounts and in high purity. In Oncogene, 5, 823 (1990),
