<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to composite film form
materials suitable for use as release sheets. It more
specifically refers to such composite materials having
improved ink adhesion characteristics.Composite polymeric film form materials are well
known in the plastics art. It is well known to make
such a composite of a construction such that it is
usable for applying releasably secured film form
material thereto, such as peelable labels.In the known construction, a base liner of
suitable film form material has a release coating
applied to at least one surface thereof. A tacky
adhesive material is applied to at least one surface of
a face stock, and the face stock is releasably adhered
to the base liner by contact of this tacky adhesive
with the release coating.The release coating is a material which adheres
well to the base liner but has the property of only
lightly holding, and therefore easily releasing, the
adhesive coated face stock film form material which is
applied thereover. This structure allows the
production of peelable labels and the like in a most
efficient fashion.In this sort of composite film form material, it
is conventional to make the release coating out of an
electron beam curable composition comprising a silicone
resin to which crosslinkable groups, such as acrylic
residues, have been appended. The silicone portion of
the composition acts as a release agent, and the
acrylic groups act to crosslink the release coating
composition together and to bond this composition to
the base liner surface.It has been found that, although this composite
structure works well and constitutes a commercially
available material, there are some things about this 
structure which perform less than satisfactorily. It
has been found that, when the composite of the release
coating and the base liner is made as an extended
length film, and it is rolled up upon itself for
storage, subject to later use by having face stock
suitably applied thereto, portions of the release
coating composition apparently do not crosslink when
subjected to the electron beam curing process. It is
not known if these portions of the compositions do not
have acrylic substituents, or if they do have such
substituents and just have not reacted sufficiently to
be well bound into the release sheet.Whatever is the reason, these more mobile portions
of the release coating composition, principally those
portions which are on the exposed surface of the
release coating, called in the industry "loose juice",
tend not to remain in the release
