<ABSTRACT>
In a demodulator, a delay detection means (1,2,3,) 
receives a π/4-shift QPSK signal and performs delay 

detection of a signal at an interval of symbols. An 
averaging circuit (4) respectively averages two channel 

quadrature signal components of a signal. A preamble 
detection means (5,6) detects a preamble having a specific 

pattern in which a phase shift of π/4 of the phase of a 
received symbol from the immediately preceding symbol 

and a phase shift of -3π/4 of a phase of a next symbol 
from the immediately preceding symbol are alternately 

repeated. 
A phase angle calculating means (7) 

calculates the phase angle of an output signal from the 
averaging circuit. A frequency offset estimating 

circuit (9) calculates a carrier frequency offset. A 
voltage-controlled oscillator has an output oscillation 

frequency variably controlled by an output signal from 
the frequency offset estimating circuit. A frequency 

converter (11) performs frequency conversion of the output 
oscillation frequency of the voltage-controlled 

oscillator and the input π/4-shift QPSK signal. A 
reproduction circuit (12) reproduces a carrier and a clock 

and obtains demodulated data by coherent 
detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a demodulator
and, more particularly, to a demodulator for acquiring a
carrier frequency for a π/4-shift QPSK signal in
satellite communications.Both quadriphase shift keying (QPSK) and
π/4-shift QPSK are digital signal modulation schemes, in
which two carriers, for binary digital signals of two
series, which have a phase difference of 90° with
respect to each other are subjected to binary phase
shift keying to generate two quadrature-modulated waves,
and the waves are added to be output, as a QPSK or
quadriphase PSK signal, to a transmission path. In both
the schemes, a quaternary signal is transmitted.
However, in the π/4-shift QPSK modulation scheme, one of
four phase states on the phase plane of two channel
quadrature signals is transmitted at a given symbol
period, and one of four phase states set by shifting
each of the above four phase states on the phase plane
by π/4 is transmitted at the next symbol. These
transmitting operations are alternately repeated. In
this regard, the π/4-shift QPSK is different from the 
QPSK in which such a shifting operation is not
performed.In the π/4-shift QPSK modulation scheme,
carrier phase states are represented in the manner shown
in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, the phase states are
shifted without passing through the origin of a signal
space diagram. For this reason, the overall envelope
fluctuations of π/4-shift QPSK are smaller than those of
QPSK in which the envelope goes through zero amplitude
when both the in-phase and quadrature channel data
change phase simultaneously. Therefore, the spread of
spectra can be suppressed even with the use of a
nonlinear amplifier.For the above reason, in using a nonlinear
amplifier, such as a class "C" amplifier, which can
amplify a signal with a high power efficiency and has a
simple structure, the π/4-shift QPSK modulation scheme
has been conventionally used, which can effectively use
a transmission band in accordance with an increase in
transmission channel capacity. This π/4-shift QPSK has
been mainly employed as a modulation scheme in digital
portable telephone and cellular mobile telephone
systems, and has also been used in mobile satellite
communications.In satellite communications, coherent
detection schemes are usually used for greater link
margin, unlike in digital portable telephone and 
cellular mobile telephone systems. In addition, in
satellite communications, a carrier frequency offset is
caused by the Doppler effect, drifts caused by a local
oscillator on the transmission
