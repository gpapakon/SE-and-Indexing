<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a pickling method 
comprising of 


i) pickling in a pickling bath with a pickling medium with 
an iron concentration of more than 150 g iron/l; 
ii) cooling the pickling medium in order to crystallize 
iron chloride; 
iii) separating formed iron chloride crystals; and 
iv) returning pickling medium with iron removed to the 
pickling bath, 
and to a pickling installation therefor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for pickling 
iron and steel products in an acid solution, wherein rust and 
possible mill scale are removed. The iron content of the 
pickling medium hereby increases gradually. At an iron 
content of 80 to 90 g iron/l the pickling action of the 
pickling medium has practically ceased. At that moment the 
pickling medium must be refreshed. A number of problems occur during regeneration. 
Firstly, the pickling medium itself has an environmental 
impact even after neutralization. Secondly, the pickling 
medium contains valuable components which are lost as a 
result of neutralization. These are reasons enough to look 
for an adapted pickling method with improved properties, 
particularly with respect to regeneration. The present invention is based on the insight that a 
pickling medium regains its pickling action when the iron 
content of the pickling medium is further increased to 
generally above 150 g iron/l, whereby it also becomes 
worthwhile to separate iron salts, such as iron chloride, 
formed by means of crystallization. Thus is achieved that the pickling action is maintained 
or even improved when compared to the use of a pickling 
medium with an iron content lower than 75 g/l, and a valuable 
crystallization product results with a comparatively small 
content of contaminants, while the treated pickling medium 
can be re-used. This results in a pickling method wherein due 
to continuous regeneration the properties of the pickling 
medium, particularly the pickling action of the pickling 
bath, remain substantially constant. This is achieved with a pickling method according to 
the invention which comprises of 
i) 
pickling in a pickling bath with a pickling medium with 
an iron concentration of more than 150 g iron/l;  ii) 
cooling the pickling medium in order to crystallize 
iron chloride; iii) 
separating formed iron chloride crystals; and iv) 
returning pickling medium with iron removed to the 
pickling bath. Although the iron content of the pickling medium 
generally lies above 150 g iron/l, it is further recommended 
to work with a pickling medium with an iron content lying 
above 175 g/l. Under practical conditions the iron 
concentration will generally lie in the range of 180 to 250 
g/l, more preferably between 190 and 210 g/l. A pickling 
medium is thus provided with a pickling action equal to or 
even greater than that of a pickling medium which works with 
an iron content smaller than 75 g/l. The pickling medium is subjected to
