<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED MULTI-LAYER LABELS Background of The InventionCurrently labels are affixed to storage batteries, such as of the types used in automobile and trucks. Because of the environment in which batteries are positioned and the fact that battery acid too often contacts the labels, they must be made of expensive materials or suffer a substantial degradation in appearance and useful life. Furthermore, battery labels are typically die cut from suitable sandwiches of materials. Because the materials of which the sandwiches are made all terminate at the die cut, outer peripheral edges of the materials, exposure to the environment and to battery acid often causes degradation of the internal printed portion of the sandwich, despite the selection and use of expensive materials.It would be of advantage to provide labels, such as battery labels which do not have the disadvan- tages of the prior art labels, which make possible the use of less expensive printed label layers, and which do not suffer degradation of the printing and internal layers in the environments in which they are customarily used. Summary of The InventionIn accordance with the present invention a corrosion-resistant, multi-layered label, such as one adapted for use on a lead storage battery, is provided. The label comprises a printed layer of a first material bearing selected information on its front surface, the printed layer being of a first shape and size in plan view. A second layer of a second material different from the printed layer is provided. The second layer is transparent so that the selected information may be viewed therethrough. The second layer is of a shape 

similar to that of the first shape in plan view and is of a second size greater than the first size. A third layer of a material different from the printed layer and covering the back surface of the printed layer is provided. The third layer is of a shape similar to that of the first shape and is of a size greater than the first size.The second and third layers envelope the printed layer and provide a protective border surrounding the printed layer so that the peripheral edge of the printed layer is spaced inwardly from the peripheral edges of the second and third layers. A first adhesive layer bonds the second layer to the front surface across its surface. A second adhesive layer bonds the inner surface of the third layer to the back surface across its surface. One of the first and second adhesive layers extends to the peripheral edges of the second and third layers for

What Is Claimed Is:
1. A lead storage battery having a multilayered label adhesively secured thereto, said label comprising a printed layer of a first material and bearing selected information on its front surface, said printed layer being of a first shape and size in plan view; a second layer of a second material different from the printed layer and covering the front surface of said printed layer, said second layer being transparent so that the selected information may be viewed therethrough, said second layer being of a shape similar to that of the first shape in plan view and being of a second size greater than the first size; a third layer of a material different from the printed layer and covering the back surface of said printed layer, said third layer being of a shape similar to that of the first shape and being of a size greater than the first size; said second and third layers enveloping said printed layer and providing a protective border surrounding said printed layer so that the peripheral edge of said printed layer is spaced inwardly from the peripheral edges of said second and third layers; a first adhesive layer bonding said second layer to said front surface across its surface; a second adhesive layer bonding the inner surface of said third layer to the back surface across its surface; one of said first and second adhesive layers extending to the peripheral edges of the second and third layers for bonding said second and third layers to each other to define said surrounding protective border; and 


 a third, pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on the outer surface of said third layer securing the battery label to said battery.
2. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 1, and wherein said first material is a paper material.
3. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 2, and wherein said second and third layer materials are polypropylene. 4. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 3, and wherein said second material is polypropylene having a shrink factor of no more than about 5%.
5. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 1, and wherein said first material is other than paper.
6. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 5, and wherein said first material is a metallic foil. 7. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 1, and wherein said selected information includes warranty date information, and further comprising a plurality of shapes cut into said protective border, said shapes being spaced away from the peripheral edge of said printed layer and aligned with said date information, so that removal of shapes may be used to signify warranty information.
8. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 1, and wherein said protective border is at least about one-eighth inch.
9. The lead storage battery having a label in accordance with claim 1, and wherein said printed, second and third layers are of a generally rectangular shape. 


 10.
