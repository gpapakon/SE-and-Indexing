<ABSTRACT>
The generation of rendering order lists, trees or 
directed graphs is performed as a pre-process for an 

interactive three-dimensional graphics system. Notional 
viewing axes are selected and a rendering order list, 

tree or directed graph is produced for each of these 
axes. 
Viewable directions for a particular list, tree or 
graph are defined as a viewable region and the size of 

said region is extended to take account of the field of 
view of the viewer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for processing data defining surface primitives
such as polygons in three-dimensional space, to produce
ordered lists for rendering views of said primitives in
two-dimensional space.In an interactive three-dimensional graphics system,
such as a system of the type disclosed in the Applicant's
European Patent Publication No. EP-A-0531157 (not
published at the first claimed priority date), data
representing polygons is manipulated in three-dimensional
space interactively, in response to input commands from
an operator. Two-dimensional images are presented to an
operator at a rate sufficient to maintain a closed
feedback loop between the operator and the virtual three-dimensional
environment.A two-dimensional image is generated by rendering the
three-dimensional image data onto a two-dimensional
plane. For each view, "hidden surface removal" can be
performed by ensuring that primitives which occlude other
primitives are rendered into the two-dimensional plane
either instead of the primitives which they occlude or
at least after said occluded polygons. Often the
occlusions are partial, therefore it is preferable to
render occluded polygons prior to rendering the occluding
polygons. In addition, totally invisible primitives may
be culled and do not require further consideration during
the rendering process. Thus, it can be appreciated that
a very important aspect of the rendering process involves 
ensuring that the primitives are rendered in the correct
order. However, determining the correct order for
rendering, repeatedly for each iteration, would account
for a considerable proportion of the available processing
time.A system for producing rendering order lists is
disclosed in the aforesaid European Patent Publication,
in which said lists are produced as a pre-process, using
a topological sort, prior to interactive operation. If
necessary, a plurality of view orientations are selected
and a rendering order list is produced for each of these
views. During interactive operation, one of these
rendering order lists is selected by comparing the actual
view orientation with the pre-processed orientations, to
determine which is the closest fit. Thus, the
computational overhead required during interactive
operation is reduced significantly.The present invention provides a method of
processing data defining surface primitives as set out
in claim 1.The present invention also provides an apparatus for
processing data defining surface primitives as set out
