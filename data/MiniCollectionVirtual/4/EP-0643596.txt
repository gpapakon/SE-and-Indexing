<ABSTRACT>
In an arrangement for monitoring a connection between two elements (2, 3) of a medical tubing system, preferably an artificial respiration system, a first sensor element (6) is arranged on the first of both elements (3) and a second sensor element (5) is arranged on the second of both elements (2) in the area of the connecction (1). At least one sensor element (6) has at least one signal generator which generates a warning signal when both sensor elements move away from each other beyond a predetermined distance.

<CLAIMS>
Medical respiration system, comprising at least two elements, of which one is a Y-piece
and one is a tube (3) connected with this Y-piece, characterized by a first sensor

element (4) provided in the area of the connection (1) on the first of the two elements,
as well as by a second sensor element (6) provided on the connection (1) on the

second of the two elements, of which one sensor element has at least one signal
transmitter (8) which triggers a signal which effects an alarm when the two sensor

elements (4, 6) become distanced from one another above a maximum set amount; as
well as by a monitoring and display device (10) which emits an acoustic and/or

optical alarm signal when the signal transmitter (8) responds, with the first sensor
element (4) having or forming at least one permanent magnet (5), and with the signal

transmitter of the second sensor element (6) being formed by at least one
magnetically operable contact, preferably by a reed contact (8) or by an electronic

sensor, e.g. Hall sensor, which responds to a magnetic field.
Device in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the monitoring and display
device (1) is a device which is to be arranged separate from the sensor elements (4,

6).
Device in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that the monitoring and display
device (10) has a housing (13) with at least one holding device, preferably formed by

at least one adhesive magnet (14), for fixing the housing (13).
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1-3, characterized in that the monitoring
and display device (10) is operated by a battery, preferably by a rechargeable battery

(22).
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1-4, characterized in that the first and/or
second sensor element (4) is provided firmly fixed on the corresponding element (3)

of the connection (1), preferably produced in one piece with this element (3) of the
connection. 
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1-5, characterized in that at least one
sensor element (6) is provided on the corresponding element (2) of the connection

(1), in such a way as to be detachable.
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1-6, characterized in that the second
sensor element (6) is connected, via a connection cable (9) or by wireless means for a

wireless data transmission, with an input (12) of the monitoring and display device
(10).
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1-7, characterized in that assigned to a
monitoring and display device (10) are at least two sensor devices which each

monitor one connection (1) and which are formed by at least a first and a second
sensor element (4, 6).
Device in accordance with one of the claims 1-8, characterized in that the monitoring
and display device (10) has electronics (19) which, after triggering an alarm, maintain

it even after the disrupted connection (1) has been reinstated, until a function key or
alarm reset key (18) on the monitoring and display device has been operated.
