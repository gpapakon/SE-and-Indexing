<ABSTRACT>
In the manufacture of arrays of semiconductor devices on a 
single substrate, said devices comprising a source region, a 

drain region and a gate therebetween, forming an isolation region 
after formation of the gate between said devices, thereby 

reducing required tolerances between devices and rows of devices 
and minimizing space requirements on the substrate for the array. 

A conventional isolation region between adjacent devices can be 
formed first, the layers comprising the gate deposited, the gate 

formed by etching through the layers, and a second isolation 
region between rows of devices formed after the gate etch. This 

reduces the built-in tolerances required between rows of devices, 
and reduces the spacing requirements between the rows.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of an array of
semiconductor devices such as transistors on a semiconductor
substrate. More particularly, this invention relates to a
process for isolating adjacent, closely spaced transistors on a
semiconductor substrate.A plurality of metal-on-silicon (MOS) field effect
transistors (FET) are made in a semiconductor substrate such as a
silicon wafer, which can be separately addressed. In order to
reduce cross talk between devices, they must be spaced from each
other; however, in order to increase the number of devices on a
single substrate, they must be as close together as possible. A
major goal of research in the past decade in the semiconductor
business has been to reconcile these conflicting requirements.
Devices are being made smaller and smaller, and as large a number
of devices as possible are being made on a single substrate or
chip. For example, document EP 0 468 938 A2 shows a compact cell
array for EPROM or ROM type memories.As devices are made closer together (high density),
techniques have been developed to isolate the active area of each
device from its neighboring devices on all sides. In one
technique, called trench isolation, at the start of device
processing, an opening or trench is made into the silicon
substrate surrounding the source, gate and drain regions of each
transistor device, and the trench is filled with a dielectric
material, such as silicon oxide. This trench provides a barrier
between devices. However, allowance must be made for alignment
tolerances in both the lateral and horizontal directions between
devices on the substrate, which increases the device size beyond
the actual active area. In an alternative isolation technique, a surface oxidation
layer is used. A nitride or other mask is provided over the area
where the active device is to be formed; e.g., boron ions are
implanted in the non-masked portions as a channel stop to define
an isolation area around the regions where the source, gate and
drain regions are to be formed within the substrate, and the
isolation area is oxidized (LOCOS process). However, the oxide
area may encroach into the active areas during subsequent device
processing, and the channel stop dopants can diffuse into the
active areas during subsequent processing steps. Thus the
defined channel becomes narrower, which increases the FET
threshold voltage and affects the current drive capability. Thus
in order to maintain the desired channel width at the end of
device processing, the channels originally must
