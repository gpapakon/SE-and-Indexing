<ABSTRACT>
Described is a direct-light illumination system for microscopes, the system including a direct-light illumination module (18) comprising a Smith divider with an integrated telesystem (14). The telesystem (14) corrects, in the same way as "image shift" optics, length differences which occur on changing from a modular-design 45  neutral divider (20) to a module (18) fitted with a Smith divider. The two lenses making up the telesystem (14) are positioned in such a way that the convergent lens (15) faces the mirror (4) of the Smith divider and the divergent lens (16) faces the light source (6). Alternatively, it is possible, when changing a module with a Smith divider for a module (19) with a 45  neutral divider (20), to use with it a telesystem with the lenses positioned in the opposite order, so that the divergent lens (16) faces the 45  neutral divider (20) and the convergent lens (15) faces the light source (6).

Incident light illumination system of the Köhler type for microscopes with fixed
aperture light stop and illuminated field light stop, characterised by a module carrier which


a) contains a first incident light illumination module (18), which consists of a Smith
divider, which comprises a mirror combination of a partially translucent planar

surface (2) and a totally reflecting mirror (4), with integrated telesystem (14),
wherein the planar surface (2) deflects an illumination ray beam (3), which

impinges horizontally onto the mirror (4) and is reflected from there towards it, in
the direction towards the object (5) co-axially to the vertically extending optical axis

(1) of the microscope, wherein the planar surface (2) of the Smith divider is
arranged at an angle of 45° in the optical axis (1) and the telesystem, which is

composed of a divergent member (16) and a collecting member (15) arranged
therebehind, restores the conditions for an illumination of the Köhler type, which

were disturbed by the insertion of the Smith divider, and is arranged in such a
manner before the Smith divider in the illumination ray beam (3) that its collecting

lens (15) is directed directly towards the Smith divider and the divergent member
(16) faces in the direction towards the light source (6) and
b) contains a second incident light module (19), which consists of a neutral divider
planar surface (20) at 45° to the optical axis (1) and is bringable into operative

setting by means of actuation of the module carrier.
