<ABSTRACT>
Process for joint production of middle distillates and of oil bases (viscosity index between 95 and 150) especially from vacuum distillates and/or deasphalted oils. The process includes a first stage in which the feedstock is brought into contact with an amorphous catalyst filled with at least one metal or metal compound which has a hydrodehydrogenating function, such as Ni, Mo, W or Co, at a temperature of between 350 and 430 DEG C, a pressure of between 5 and 20 MPa, a space velocity of between 0.1 and 5 h
<
-1
>
 and in the presence of hydrogen in an H2/HC volume ratio = 150 to 2,000, the product originating from the first stage is brought into contact (in a second stage), with a second catalyst including a support, a zeolite Y, at least one element of group VIB and at least one metal of group VIII at a temperature of between 350 and 430 DEG C, a pressure of between 5 and 20 MPa and a space velocity of between 0.1 and 5 h
