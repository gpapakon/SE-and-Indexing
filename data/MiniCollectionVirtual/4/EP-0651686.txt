<ABSTRACT>
A tubular spindle-drive sleeve (34) rotates about longitudinal axis (20) while axially immovable. Spindle (31) is axially slidable in and rotatably driven by the sleeve. A linear drive, non-rotating ball screw (51) connected to the upper end of the spindle (31) is driven axially by a powered ball nut (66) to advance and retract the spindle in the sleeve. Coupling plug (19) fixed at the bottom of spindle (31) connects to any one of various toolholders (23) in turret (21). Axial movement of spindle (31) by ball nut (66) automatically couples and decouples the spindle to and from the toolholder (23). Fluid supply (82) down through the spindle is provided. In figure 4, air motor (93) mounted inside spindle (91) is coupled to a second spindle (116) in the changeable toolholder (97) to drive a cutting tool (122) at a much higher rotational rate than is possible with the main spindle alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to machine tools, and
more particularly to the spindle mount and drive and
toolholder for a machine tool with automatic toolchanger.The machine tool art is extensive. Vertical milling
machines constitute a large component of the machine tool
art. Typically they include a horizontally positionable
table to hold the workpiece, a tool (usually a cutter of some
type) for treating the workpiece, a powered rotating spindle
for rotating the tool and vertically drivable by hand or
power to advance the tool into the workpiece. More recent
machines are controlled by computer and, due to their
versatility, are commonly referred to as computer numerically
controlled, or CNC, machining centers. They are usually
equipped with some kind of automatic tool changing feature to
enable the machine to make different types, sizes and
contours of cuts, some of them including means for
translating the workpiece mounting table or the spindle on
horizontal axes automatically for contouring.A machining center having such features is shown and
described in U. S. Patent No. 4,443,929 issued April 24, 1984
to me and Walter Breitkopf. It uses an automatic tool
changing feature as disclosed in more detail in U. S. Patent
No. 3,999,769 issued December 28, 1976 to me and Walter
Breitkopf, and which, for some features, refers to our
earlier U.S. Patent No. 3,797,956 issued March 19, 1974. In
that system, and referring to the reference numerals in the 
earlier Patent No. 3,999,769, toolholders 58 Were removably
mounted in retaining rings 48 mounted in a rotatable turret
plate 44 which could be indexed to place the axis of any one
of the toolholders in line with a coupling plug 36 at the
bottom of the tool drive spindle 30. When the turret plate
was rotated to place the desired toolholder directly under
and in axial alignment with the spindle, the spindle was
driven downward by the spindle mounting sleeve 24 in Fig. 2
of that patent for engagement of the coupling plug 36 on the
spindle with the toolholder. Further downward drive of the
spindle drove the toolholder out of the turret plate and into
position to engage the cutting tool therein (not shown) with
the workpiece. The spindle drive motor was energized to
rotate the spindle for the cutting operation, while the
sleeve 24 did not rotate. The purpose of the sleeve was to
contain and rotatably support the spindle and drive the
spindle up and down in the housing 22. When the machining
with the cutter in that toolholder was complete, the spindle
sleeve was
