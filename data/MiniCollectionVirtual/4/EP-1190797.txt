<ABSTRACT>
The tool has a tool head, a clamping member and a helix with several thread pitches of which at least two are provided where the helix cross-section (11) has no whole-number rotational symmetry. The two axial resistance moments of the helix cross-section in a local coordinate system which co-rotates with the helix are substantially comparable. In regard to the axis of rotation the two helical threads include an angle of between 120 and 170 degrees.

Drill bit (1) for the abrasive removal of material, with a tip (2), a chucking end (3), and a twist spiral (4) extending along the rotational axis (A) at least part-way between [the two ends of the bit] and comprising a number of turns [(lands)]
 (5) extending in a helix about the rotational axis (A), wherein the twist spiral (4) consists of a central core [(web]) (6) containing the rotational axis (A) and at least one [spiral turn]
 (5) adjoining [the said core, with a] height (7) reaching up to an envelope curve (8), [and]
 wherein at least two spiral turns (5) are present for which the spiral cross-section (11) does not possess whole-number rotational symmetry, 
characterized in that
 the two axial resistance moments of the spiral cross-section (11) in a local coordinate system co-rotating with the twist spiral (4) are of equal magnitude.
Twist spiral [
sic
] according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the twist spiral (4) has two turns [(lands)] (5).
Twist spiral [
sic
] according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the two spiral turns (5) include an angle with respect to the rotational axis (A) of between 120° and 179°.
Twist spiral [
sic
] according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the arrangement of the cutting edges of the tip (2) does not possess whole-number rotational symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the rotational direction [
sic
] (A).
