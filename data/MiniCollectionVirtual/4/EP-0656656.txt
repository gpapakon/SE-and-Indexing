<ABSTRACT>
A trench capacitor DRAM cell with Shallow Trench Isolation 
(STI), a self-aligned buried strap and the method of making the 

cell. A trench capacitor is defined in a substrate. The 
trench capacitor's polysilicon (poly) plate is recessed below 

the surface of the substrate and the trench sidewalls are 
exposed above the poly. A doped poly layer is deposited over 

the surface contacting both the sidewall and the trench 
capacitor's poly plate. Horizontal portions of the poly layer 

are removed either through chem-mech polishing or Reactive Ion 
Etching (RIE). A shallow trench is formed, removing one 

formerly exposed trench sidewall and a portion of the trench 
capacitor's poly plate in order to isolate the DRAM cell from 

adjacent cells. The remaining poly strap, along the trench 
sidewall contacting the poly plate, is self aligned to contact 

the source of the DRAM Pass gate Field Effect Transistor (FET). 
After the shallow trench is filled with oxide, FET's are formed 

on the substrate, completing the cell. In an alternate 
embodiment, instead of recessing the poly plate, a shallow 

trench is formed spanning the entire width of the trench 
capacitor. The deposited polysilicon is selectively removed, 

having straps that strap the poly plate to the shallow trench 
sidewall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a semiconductor 
memory, and more particularly to a method of fabricating a 
Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM). Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) cells are well known. 
A DRAM cell is essentially a capacitor for storing charge and 
a pass transistor (also called a pass gate) for transferring 
charge to and from the capacitor. Because cell size determines 
chip density, size and cost, reducing cell area is the DRAM 
designer's primary goal. Reducing cell area is done, normally, 
by reducing feature size to shrink the cell. Besides shrinking the cell, the most effective way to 
reduce cell area is to reduce the largest feature in the cell, 
typically, the area of the storage capacitor. Unfortunately, 
shrinking the capacitor area reduces capacitance and, 
consequently, reduces stored charge. Reduced charge means what 
is stored in the DRAM is more susceptible to noise, soft 
errors, leakage and other typical DRAM problems. Consequently, 
a DRAM cell designer's goal is to maintain storage capacitance 
without sacrificing cell area. One way to accomplish this goal for high density DRAMs is 
to use trench capacitors in the cell. Trench Capacitors are 
formed by placing the capacitor on its side, in a trench, and 
are vertical with respect to the chip's surface. Thus, the 
space required for the storage capacitor is dramatically 
reduced without sacrificing capacitance, and more importantly, 
stored charge.  Figure 1 is an example of prior art trench capacitor DRAM 
cells and Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the DRAM cells 
of FIG. 1. Each cell 100 is isolated from other cells 100 by 
a deep trench 102. A polysilicon layer 104 in the trench 102 
encircles each cell 100 and is the storage plate of the cell's 
storage capacitor. A layer of oxide 106 separates each storage 
plate 104 from a layer of polysilicon 108 (poly) separating 
cells 100 and forming the storage capacitors' reference plate. 
A buried polysilicon contact 110 is formed after the pass gate, 
a Field Effect Transistor (FET), is defined. The contact 110 
provides the pass gate's source and straps the FET's source to 
the poly storage plate 104. A polysilicon word line 112 forms 
the FET's gate, with its drain 114 connected to bit line 
contact 116. Thus, as can be seen from the above example, 
using a trench capacitor eliminates much of the cell area, i.e. 
cell area formerly reserved for the storage capacitor. 
However, forming the strap between the pass gate and the 
capacitor is a delicate
