<ABSTRACT>
To create a snap-action switch (1) that provides separate solutions for the mechanical function of "switching" and the electrical function of "contact bridging", the snap-action element (4) is designed as one piece made of round wire and a contact element (5) is held within the snap-action element (4).

<CLAIMS>
Quick-break electrical switch with a housing (2) and with
a contact element (5) which connects two contact points (6,

7) fixed to the housing and is movable between two switch
positions and which can be transferred from one switch

position to the other switch position by an operating member
(3) acting on a quick-break switch element (4) and guided in

the housing (2), wherein after transfer of the quick-break
switch element (4) from one to the other switch position,

the quick-break switch element (4) is returned to the
original switch position by the quick-break switch element

(4) automatically, characterised in that the quick-break
switch element (4) is made in one piece from a round wire

and in that the contact element (5) is gimbal-mounted within
the quick-break switch element (4).
Quick-break electrical switch according to claim 1,
characterised in that the round wire is made of spring

steel.
Quick-break electrical switch according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the quick-break switch element (4) is

bent like a frame, wherein one free side (9) is held in a
bearing point (10) of a carrier (8), and from an opposite

side (11) an upwardly curved U-shaped spring (12) extends
into the quick-break switch element (4), which spring is

supported in a further bearing point (13) of the carrier (8)
with slight bracing. 
Quick-break electrical switch according to claim 3,
characterised in that the contact element (5) is held

between inner arms (17, 18) of the U-shaped spring (12).
Quick-break electrical switch according to either of
claims 3 or 4, characterised in that lateral arms (14, 15)

of the quick-break switch element (4) are prevented from
splaying.
Quick-break electrical switch according to claim 5,
characterised in that a clip (27) is arranged around the

inner arms (17, 18) of the U-shaped spring (12) between the
bearing point (13) and the contact element (5).
Quick-break electrical switch according to claim 5,
characterised in that on the side (11) of the quick-break

switch element (4) opposite the free side (9), on both sides
of the opening (20) of the U-shaped spring (12), is mounted

a wire section (28).
Quick-break electrical switch according to claim 3,
characterised in that the contact element (5) is held

between lateral arms (14, 15) of the quick-break switch
element (4) and the inner arms (17, 18) of the U-shaped

spring (12) cross the lateral arms (14, 15).
Quick-break electrical switch according to any of claims
1 to 8, characterised in that the contact element (5) is

round with a contact surface (21, 22) crowned on one or both
sides. 
Quick-break electrical switch according to any of claims
1 to 9, characterised in that in the housing (2) are formed

guide elements (25, 26) for the quick-break switch element
(4).
