<ABSTRACT>
There are described herbicidal suspension concentrates which are water-based and comprise at least one representative of the group consisting of the carbamate herbicides, benzofuran herbicides and triazinone herbicides. The herbicidal suspension concentrates according to the invention are prepared by subjecting the dispersion to ultrafine grinding in a colloid mill and are applied by the "splitting" method.
