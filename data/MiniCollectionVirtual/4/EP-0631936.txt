<ABSTRACT>
The procedure consists in obtaining, in a first 
phase, oversized packages containing multiple unitary 

metered amounts of product and, in a second phase, by 
means of pressing, heat-sealing and cutting, to obtain 

multiple smaller packages containing respective unitary 
metered amounts and with any configuration. 
The first phase is carried out in a conventional 
injection/metering/heat-sealing apparatus (1), from which 

oversized packages (9) are extracted which are subjected 
to the action of means (16) for smoothing and uniformly 

distributing the product inside each package (9) in 
order, finally and on a press (17), to carry out final 

subdivision, sealing and cutting of the unitary packages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
procedure for packaging liquid products in envelope-type 
receptacles or wrappers, commonly known as "packeting", 
which procedure is particularly suitable for packaging 
oily or viscous products such as, for example, honey. The invention also relates to a packaging machine 
which permits implementation of the above-mentioned 
procedure. The invention additionally relates to the package 
obtained with this packaging procedure and this packaging 
machine. As is known, it is an increasingly widely used 
practice to supply certain liquid or pasty food products, 
such as the above-mentioned honey, jams, etc., in 
conveniently packeted individual metered amounts which 
constitute units for consumption in a similar manner to 
conventional envelopes containing sugar. Injection/metering machines are known, which, 
either using a continuous tubular body with a plastic 
nature or, alternatively, two sheets which the actual 
machine welds longitudinally in order to convert them 
into a tubular body, establish transverse heat-sealing 
lines in said tubular body and, immediately after each 
transverse heat-sealing line, supply the tubular body 
with a metered amount of product, thereby arriving at the 
various metered amounts being received in independent 
vessels established in longitudinal alignment over the 
continuous tubular body which is then divided up in order 
to obtain the unitary packages of product.  Productivity is limited by this packaging 
procedure in that, as may be appreciated from the aforesaid, 
each operating unit or each unitary machine can 
make and fill the packages only one by one, that is to 
say that this is a repetitive process, with intermittent 
stops, in which the following sequence of operations 
takes place: metering of the product and its supply to a 
unitary package, closure of the package; metering and 
supply of the product to a new unitary package, closure 
of the package, and so on. Moreover, the packages can be closed only either 
at atmospheric pressure or, alternatively, at a specific 
pressure with which the operating mechanisms of the 
machine are surrounded and which requires pressurizing 
means separate from the machine, with the consequent rise 
in costs that this involves. Finally, there is also considerable limitation 
with respect to the configuration of the packages, since 
the total closure of each one of them involves the 
partial or initial closure of the next one and each 
packaging unit has to offer a wide aperture for

Procedure for packaging liquid products such as, 
for example, food products such as honey, in a package 

containing a unitary consumption metered amount, characterized 
in that, in this procedure, there are two 

successive and independent operating phases, a first 
phase in which oversized packages are formed, each 

containing multiple unitary metered amounts of product, 
and a second phase in which said oversized packages are 

firstly subjected to an operation of smoothing or homogeneous 
distribution of the product and, finally, to a 

phase of compartmentalization and separation by means of 
cutting and heat-sealing of the walls of the oversized 

package in order to form definitive unitary packages 
carrying respective unitary metered amounts, with any 

configuration or outline which is different from that of 
the initial oversized packages. 
Packaging machine for implementing the procedure 
of Claim 1, characterized in that it comprises: an 

injection/metering/heat-sealing apparatus (1), of any 
conventional type, capable of forming the initial oversized 

packages (9); means for smoothing the oversized 
bags (9-48) and uniform distribution of their contents, 

and a press (17-17') equipped with heat-sealing and 
cutting means which subdivides each oversized package 

(9-48) into a plurality of packages (22-45) carrying 
respective unitary metered amounts. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that, for smoothing the oversized packages 

(9), provision has been made for them to be arranged on 
supports or pallets (10) which are displaced towards the 

press (17) on a conveyor belt which circulates under a 
plurality of smoothing rollers (3) having a position 

which can be graduated and which are arranged 
transversely to the direction of displacement of the 

conveyor belt. 
Packaging machine according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the press (17), actuated by means of 

 
pneumatic pistons (18), incorporates, in its movable and 

stationary parts, respective changeable grids, each grid 
corresponding to the movable part having a plurality of 

elastically deformable reliefs or protuberances (21), 
preferably of rubber, which define a lattice with the 

forms corresponding to the unitary packages (22) to be

the press (17), there are cutting electrical resistance 
elements (23), complementing said protuberances (21),

blocks there are four operating sectors: a first 
sector (33-34) in which the upper block incorporates a 

package press plate and the lower block incorporates a 
smooth base for uniform distribution of the product 

inside the package; a second sector (35-37) in which the 
upper block (31) incorporates a plurality of presser-expeller 

rubbers (36) aligned in a specific direction and 
the lower block (32) incorporates a grid (38) based on
