<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic
light sensitive material, particularly to a novel silver
halide photographic light sensitive material containing a
compound capable of functioning as a noble nucleating agent.In a photomechanical process where a continuous tone
densities of an original are converted respectively into the
group consisting of the halftone dots having the areas
proportionl to the density, a silver halide photographic light
sensitive material (hereinafter referred simply to a light
sensitive material) having a high contrast photographic
characteristic is generally used.For providing a high contrast characteristic to an image,
a desired photographic light sensitive material has been
prepared in such a manner as described in Japanese Patent
Publication Open to Public Inspection (hereinafter referred to 
as JP OPI Publication) No. 56-106244/1981, U.S. Patent No.
4,686,167 and European Patent No. 333,435; in which a compound
such as hydrazine is contained as a nucleating agent into a
silver halide photographic light sensitive material and silver
halide grains capable of effectively displaying contrast-increasing
characteristic of the compound are further used or
other photographic additives are suitably used in combination.
The silver halide photographic light sensitive materials such
as those mentioned above are apparently proved to be stable as
a light sensitive material and a high contrast photographic
image can be obtained even when they are processed with a
rapid processable developer.However, if these photographic materials are used in the
step of converting a continuous tone image to a halftone
image, sandlike fog or black dot which is generally referred
to pepper fog can occur in halftone dots, leading to impaired
dot quality, particularly when enlarging a screen image.
These are remarkable particularly after raw stock keeping. In
an attempt at solving this problem, various stabilizers ot
restrainers having hetero atom(s) have been added but this has
not always proved to be a complete solution. Under these
circumstances, a light sensitive material that uses an
effective contrast increasing agent free from that problem is
desired.On the other hand, as one of the methods for forming a
positive image with the use of a direct positive type silver 
halide photographic light sensitive material, there has been
known a method for forming a positive image in which an
unfogged internal latent image silver halide emulsion is used
and, after imagewise exposed to light, is
