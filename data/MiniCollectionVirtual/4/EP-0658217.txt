<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF SALTS FROM ALUMINUM DROSSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for the removal of salt from aluminum dross, and more particularly it relates to a sequential, two-step leaching process for salt-containing aluminum dross. Background of the InventionDuring the smelting of aluminum scrap, such as used beverage containers and the like, large quantities of salt flux, normally containing sodium and/or potassium chlorides, are added to the smelter furnaces. This flux accumulates on top of the molten bath and forms a dross which typically contains aluminum values in the form of metallic aluminum, as well as aluminum oxides and metal salts.There are various known procedures for pro¬ cessing secondary aluminu dross or salt cake. One such process involves initially reducing the particle size of the dross, e.g., by impact and ball milling processing. Following particle size reduction, the dross is melted under a salt flux cover to dissolve 

 - ■j — the contaminants therein, mostly aluminum oxide, and recover the aluminum metal. Typically, rich dross (containing 30-70% aluminum) and low-grade dross (containing 5-30% aluminum) are melted in rotary furnaces using a sodium chloride-potassium chloride flux which may include 2-5% cryolite. As the flux becomes contaminated with aluminum oxide, it is removed as salt slag (by skimming or raking) and then solidified. Although this salt slag contains poten¬ tially valuable materials that could be recovered, it is generally the practice to dispose of the salt slag in a landfill. However, the soluble salts present in the slag represent a potential source of pollution to surface and ground water supplies. Accordingly, it is increasingly important, both for economic as well as environmental reasons, to eliminate landfill disposal of these salt slags.Other previously employed procedures for processing secondary aluminum dross involve crushing the aluminum dross, separating the larger and smaller particles, and concurrently treating the larger and smaller particles in distinct leaching operations. In a specific prior process of this general type, magne¬ sium chloride is added to the leaching solution, which is used to leach the larger particles, to maintain the pH of that solution in the range of about 7-8.5. This process is described in co-pending and commonly owned
