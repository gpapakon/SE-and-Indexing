<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
hydrating a cycloolefin to produce a cyclic alcohol. 
More particularly, the present invention is concerned 
with a method for hydrating a cycloolefin, in which the 
hydration is conducted in a reaction system comprising 
a continuous aqueous phase including water and a crystalline 
aluminosilicate catalyst suspended therein and 
an oil phase including a cycloolefin, while dispersing 
the oil phase as globules having a specific diameter. 
In the method of the present invention, not only can a 
cyclic alcohol be produced at high selectivity and in 
high yield, but the activity of the catalyst can also 
be stably maintained at a high level for a prolonged 
period of time, and the produced cyclic alcohol can be 
readily separated. Various methods for hydrating a cycloolefin by 
reacting the same with water to produce a cyclic alcohol 
have been proposed, which include for example, a 
method in which indirect or direct hydration of a 
cycloolefin is carried out using a mineral acid, such 
as sulfuric acid, as a homogeneous catalyst, and a 
method in which the hydration is carried out using an  
 
aromatic sulfonic acid as a homogeneous catalyst (see 
Japanese Patent Application Publication Specification 
No. 43-16125/1968). In Example 2 of this published 
specification, 200 g of an oil phase comprised of a 
mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexane is reacted at 
90 °C for 12 hours with 160 g of an aqueous phase 
comprised of water containing p-toluenesulfonic acid. 
After completion of the reaction, the aqueous phase is 
separated from the oil phase, and 200 g of water is 
added to the aqueous phase and subjected to steam 
distillation while heating. By the steam distillation, 
cyclohexanol is distilled off to obtain the same. This 
procedure has drawbacks in that the separation of 
cyclohexanol as a reaction product from the aqueous 
phase is not only time-consuming but also disadvantageously 
causes a large energy consumption. As a method for coping with the above-mentioned 
drawbacks of the method using a homogeneous catalyst, a 
method has been proposed in which a solid catalyst, 
such as an ion exchange resin, is used (see Japanese 
Patent Application Publication Specification No. 38-15619/1963 
and Japanese Patent Application Publication 
Specification No. 44-26656/1969). However, this method 
also has a drawback in that the activity of the catalyst 
cannot be maintained for a long time because the  
 
ion exchange resin is likely to suffer from
