<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an agricultural soil-working machine (machine for working the land). According to the invention, the agricultural soil-working machine (1) is noteworthy in that the chassis (12) includes at least one guide arm (21, 22) supporting at least one carrying structure (36, 37, 38, 39) with a group of soil-working tools (40) by means of a corresponding articulation (45), and that the said guide arm or arms (21, 22) is/are connected to the frame (20) by means of a respective articulation (32, 33) with axis of pivoting (32A, 33A) pointing upwards, so that the said corresponding carrying structures (36, 37, 38, 39) can occupy several working positions by pivoting about the said axis of pivoting (32A, 33A), in which working positions the groups of soil-working tools (40) of the two corresponding carrying structures (36, 37, 38, 39) extend at least substantially end to end and at least substantially longitudinally in the extension of one another.

Agricultural machine for working the soil, including: 

a chassis (112) with a flame (20) and a guide arm (121) connected to the 
flame (20) by means of an articulation (132) with its axis of pivoting 

(132A) pointing upwards, 
a connection device (3) serving to connect the said chassis (112) to a motor 
vehicle (2), 
a pair of supporting structures (36, 37) each one supporting a group of soil-working 
tools (40) and each one connected to the said chassis (112) by 

means of a respective articulation (45) with its axis of pivoting (45A) 
pointing upwards, one (37) of these being more specifically connected to 

the said guide arm (121) by means of its respective articulation (45) in such 
a way that the said supporting structures (36, 37) can be pivoted about their 

respective axis of pivoting (45A) from a transport position in which the said 
agricultural soil-working machine (101) has a reduced transport width, into 

a work position in which the groups of soil-working tools (40) of the said 
parr of supporting structures (36, 37) extend end to end and longitudinally 

in line with one another and vice versa, 
characterized in
 that: 

the other supporting structure (36) of the said pair of supporting structures 
(36, 37) is connected to the flame (20) by means of its respective articulation 

(45) and 
the axis of pivoting (132A) of the articulation (132) connecting the guide 
arm (121) to the flame (20) is coincident with the axis of pivoting (45A) of 

the said articulation (45) connecting the other supporting structure (36) to 
the said flame (20). 
Agricultural soil-working machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 
that the two supporting structures (36, 37) of the said pair can be pivoted  

 
with respect to the guide arm (121) about the axis of pivoting (45A) of their 

respective articulation (45) by means of at least one positioning element (49) 
controlled from the motor vehicle (2). 
Agricultural soil-working machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
 
that the pivoting of the two supporting structures (36, 37) of the said pair 

about the axis of pivoting (45A) of their respective articulation (45) is 
achieved by means of a single positioning element (49). 
Agricultural soil-working machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 


characterized in
 that the guide arm (121) can be pivoted with respect to the 
flame (20) about its axis of pivoting (132A) from a transport position into a 

work position and vice versa by means of at least one operating member 
(134) controlled from the motor vehicle (2). 
Agricultural soil-working machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in
 that: 

the chassis (112) includes an additional guide arm (122) connected to the 
flame (20) by means of an articulation (133) with its axis of pivoting 

(133A) pointing upwards; 
it also includes a pair of additional supporting structures (38, 39) each one 
supporting a group of soil-working tools (40), one (38) of which is 

connected to the said additional guide arm (122) by means of a respective 
articulation (45) with its axis of pivoting (45A) pointing upwards and the 

other (39) of which is connected to the flame (20) of the chassis (112) by 
means of a respective articulation (45) with its axis of pivoting (45A) also 

pointing upwards and coincident with the axis of pivoting (133A) of the 
articulation (133) connecting the additional guide arm (122) to the flame 

(20) in such a way that the said additional supporting structures (38, 39)
