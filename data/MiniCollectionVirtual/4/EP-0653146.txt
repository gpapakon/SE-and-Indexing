<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a d.c.-operated furnace installation. Into a metallurgical vessel (10) having a base electrode (35) projects an electrode (34) which is secured to a bearer arm (21) acting as a choke and having a tubular shape, inside the tube and concentrically with the central axis of which is arranged a conductive sleeve (32) which electrically connects the electrode (34) to a d.c. power supply unit (50) via flexible leads (31).

<CLAIMS>
A furnace installation operated by direct current, with 
a metallurgical vessel (10) having a base electrode (35), 

into which vessel (10) an electrode (34) projects, which is 
secured on a supporting arm (21) which via flexible feed 

lines (31) connects the electrode (34) electrically with a 
direct current supply installation (50),
 
characterised in that
 
the supporting arm (21) has a tubular shape and is equipped 

as a throttle and that in its tubular interior, concentric 
to its central axis, a current-carrying casing (32) is 

arranged. 
A furnace installation according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the current-carrying casing (32) is constructed as an 

internal copper plating of the supporting arm (21). 
A furnace installation according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
between the current-carrying casing (32) and the supporting 

arm (21) insulations (24) are provided. 
A furnace installation according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
arrangements (41,42) for the supply and removal of cooling 

medium are provided on the current-carrying casing (32). 
A furnace installation according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the supporting arm (21) is a square 

tube.
