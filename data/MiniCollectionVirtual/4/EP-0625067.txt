<ABSTRACT>
Water present in a hot gaseous product stream from a reactor system (A, B) (Figure 1) containing hydrogen fluoride is separated from the stream in order to eliminate a potentially corrosive combination of water and HF. The water is removed by contacting the gaseous product stream with liquid HF in a distillation column so as to obtain a bottom product containing liquid HF and water and a top product containing dry HF and the product to be recovered. The invention encompasses the separation process, a vessel for carrying out the process (Figures 2 to 4), a control system for the liquid HF supply to the distillation column (Figures 5 and 6) and a recovery system for recovering HF employed during operation of the reactor system in different regimes employing HF as a fluorination agent, as a diluent during catalyst regeneration and/or catalyst prefluorination (Figure 7).

<DESCRIPTION>
 WATER SEPARATION PROCESSThis invention relates to a process involving the treatment of water-containing gaseous streams.In particular, the invention relates to a process involving a gaseous stream containing hydrogen fluoride and water vapour.A typical process to which the invention pertains is the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with various compounds, for example chlorinated alkanes or chlorinated olefins, over catalysts such as chromium oxide for the purpose of effecting fluorination of such compounds. For instance, C compounds such as trichloroethylene and/or l,l,l-trifluoro-2-chloroethane may be fluorinated to produce1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (Refrigerant 134a).A typical gaseous product stream obtained in these processes can contain fluorinated product, unchanged starting material, unchanged HF, and HC1 as a product of the halogen exchange reaction. We have found that, in scaling up such fluorination processes with the aim of achieving acceptable conversion efficiencies, the gaseous product stream may contain unacceptable levels of water vapour. For instance, in the reaction of trichloroethylene and/or l,l,l-trifluoro-2-chloroethane with HF to produce1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, conversion efficiency may be enhanced by carrying out the process using a stoichiometric excess of HF and an increased inventory of catalyst. However, any water that may be generated in the course of carrying out the reaction (eg removal of oxygen from the catalyst which will often be an oxide) or present in the reactants, will tend combine with the HF because of the affinity of HF for water and, if the HF is recyled to the reaction as is desirable if effective use is to be made of the HF, the water content in the gaseous product stream tends to build up. The presence of significant amounts of water in the gaseous product stream gives rise to a serious obstacle to further treatment of this reaction stream because of the highly corrosive nature of condensate containing HF and water. It is well known that aqueous solutions of HF attack all normal materials of construction; consequently, unless the problem posed by the increased water content resulting from operation with an excess of HF and increased inventory of catalyst can be overcome, the opportunities for enhanced conversion efficiency afforded by these expedients are largelySUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 counteracted by the need to employ expensive HF-resistant coatings for ductwork/vessels etc in the further stages of the process.According to a first broad aspect of the invention
