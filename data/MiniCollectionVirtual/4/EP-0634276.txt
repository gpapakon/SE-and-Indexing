<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for separating tape (4) at a cut edge is described in 
which a bend is formed in the tape and in which a wall portion (42) 

acts against the cut edge (50) of the tape so that as the tape (4) is 
drawn to straighten it, there is resilience in an upper layer 

of the tape (4) which overcomes the adhesive strength between 
upper and lower layers and causes them to separate at the cut 

edge (50) of the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tape cutting apparatus and is
particularly but not exclusively concerned with cutting tape
used in thermal printing devices.Thermal printing devices of the type with which the present
invention is primarily concerned operate with a supply of tape
arranged to receive an image and a means for transferring
image onto the tape. In one form, a tape holding case holds a
supply of image receiving tape and a supply of an image
transfer ribbon, the image receiving tape and the transfer
ribbon being passed in overlap through a printing zone of the
printing device. A printing device operating with a tape
holding case of this type is described for example in
EP-A-0267890 (Varitronics, Inc.). Other printing devices have
been made in which letters are transferred to an image
receiving tape by a dry lettering or dry film impression
process. In all of these printing devices, the construction
of the image receiving tape is substantially the same. That
is, it comprises an upper layer for receiving an image which
is secured to a releaseable backing layer by a layer of
adhesive. Once an image or message has been printed on the
tape, it is desired to cut off that portion of the tape to
enable it to be used as a label. For this purpose, it is
necessary to remove the releaseable backing layer from the
upper layer to enable the upper layer to be secured to a
surface by means of the adhesive layer. With existing
printing devices, it is difficult to remove the releaseable
backing layer from the upper layer: it is necessary first to
separate the closely adhered end portions of the releaseable
backing layer and the upper layer, for example using a
fingernail or tweezers so that the separated end portion of
the releaseable backing layer can be finger gripped to peel it
off the adhesive layer. This is a relatively difficult
procedure and furthermore can result in the ends of the label
being damaged in the process. There have been several attempts to solve this problem. Most
such attempts have sought to rely on the provision of a
so-called tab cut. In these devices, a first cut is made
completely through all the layers of the tape to cut off a
portion of the tape and at the same time a cut is made through
only one layer of the tape. This provides a "tab" which, in
theory, can be peeled away reasonably easily. While a tab cut
has been implemented successfully with relatively thick, stiff
upper layers there are significant difficulties in
implementing so-called tab cut devices for tapes of the type
used

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (34) for separating an upper layer (4a) from
a lower layer (4b) against an adhesive strength between the upper

and lower layers at a cut edge (50) of a portion of tape (4), the
apparatus comprising a tape separating member (36) at which a

bend can be formed in the tape (4) and which has a recess (38)
having a foremost wall (40) and rearmost wall (42) in the

direction of withdrawal of the tape, characterised in that the
rearmost wall (42) provides a wall portion configured to prevent

the cut edge of the tape from slipping upwards allowing the tape
(4) to straighten so that as the tape (4) is drawn out of the

tape separating member (36) to straighten it the resilience in
the upper layer overcomes the adhesive strength between upper and

lower layers and causes them to separate at the cut edge (50) of
the tape (4).
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the wall portion
includes a notch (44) which serves to retain the cut edge (50)

of the tape (4) as the tape is drawn out.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim which comprises
a slide member (48) adapted to cooperate with the tape separating

member (36) to cause a bend in said tape (4).
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein the slide member (36)
is attached to a cutting blade (30) which cuts the tape (4) to

form said cut edge (50) before the bend is formed.
A tape holding case which contains apparatus according to
any preceding claim and a supply of image receiving tape (4),

said image receiving tape having an upper layer (4a) and a lower
layer (4b) secured to one another by adhesive. 
A printing device comprising:

a printing mechanism for printing an image onto an image
receiving tape (4);
a cutter (26) for cutting off a portion of the image
receiving tape;
said image receiving tape (4) having an upper layer (4a) and
a lower layer (4b) secured to one another by adhesive; and
an apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5.
