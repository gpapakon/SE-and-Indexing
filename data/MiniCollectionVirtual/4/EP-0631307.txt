<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates relates to a method of selecting a
trench depth with respect to a trench width for trenches
in a semiconductor device.The technology of an element isolating region is one important
technology in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. As the trend to large
scale integration and miniaturization of semiconductor devices advances, the
isolation of elements is becoming more and more difficult. In order to increase
the degree of integration, the method of shrinking the dimensions for element
isolation is an important topic, and is limited to the conventionally known
LOCal Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) method. In order to overcome this
limitation, a trench embedding element isolation structure (hereinafter, referred
to as embedded element isolation) has been proposed wherein narrow openings
and deep grooves (trenches) are formed in the main surface of the
semiconductor substrate and SiO2 or SiO2 and polysilicon are embedded in
these trenches. With this structure it is possible to maintain the distance
between the elements in the direction of depth and to reduce the
punch-through problem and the parasitic MOS transistor influence.The fabricating process for embedded element isolation in a
semiconductor device made by conventional technology and the structure will
now be explained with reference to FIGs. 1A to 1E.First, as shown in FIG.1A, a thin oxidized film 2 is formed on the main
surface of a P-type silicon semiconductor substrate 1 by a thermal oxidation
method, and an Si3N4 film is formed as an insulating film 3 on the oxidized
film 2.Next, a photoresist film (omitted from the drawing) is formed as a mask
by using a photolithographic etching method, and then the Si3N4 film 3 and 
the oxidized film 2 is selectively removed by means of RIE (Reactive Ion
Etching), which become a part of element isolating regions later.Then, as shown in FIG.1B, the Si3N4 film 3 which has been selectively
etched in this manner above and on which a specified pattern is formed, is
used as a mask and a plurality of trenches 4 of specified widths W1, W2, and
W3, and a specified depth D1 are formed on the underlying semiconductor
substrate 1 by anisotropic etching such as RIE or the like. At this time the
trenches 4 have a uniform depth D1 unrelated to the element isolation widths
W1, W2, and W3.Next, as shown in FIG.1C, the semiconductor substrate 1 is thermally
oxidized so that an oxidized film 5 is formed on the exposed inside walls of
the trenches 4.Next, P-type impurities are ion-implanted on the
