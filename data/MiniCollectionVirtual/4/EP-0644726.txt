<DESCRIPTION>
The aim of the invention is a method to manufacture 
a biotechnical product lowering the cholesterol 
level in blood. A raised cholesterol level of blood is known 
to increase arteroschlerosis and thus the number of 
cardiovascular and internal diseases. The cholesterol 
content in blood is hazardously increased by foods 
containing cholesterol, particularly saturated fats and 
foods containing them, such as fatty beef, pork, pork 
fat, mutton fat, eggs, etc. Attempts have been made to 
solve the problem by increasing the use of foods with 
low cholesterol content i.e. with unsaturated fat content 
instead of foods with saturated fat content. The 
problem of the use of fats with saturated fatty acids 
and increasing the cholesterol content of blood has, 
however not been satisfactorily solved by this. The purpose of the present invention is to 
remove the shortcomings mentioned above. A particular 
purpose of the invention is to present a method to 
manufacture a biotechnical product by which the properties 
in food products with saturated fat content, which 
increase the cholesterol content of blood, can be decreased. 
A special aim of the invention is to present a 
method by which a biotechnical product, lowering the 
cholesterol content of blood can be manufactured from 
prime meat food so that the possible cholesterol contained 
by the meat will not cause an increase in the 
cholesterol content of blood, but will instead be eliminated 
from the system without causing an increase in 
the cholesterol content of blood. A further aim of the 
invention is to present a method to manufacture the  
 
product in question, which will even lower the cholesterol 
level in blood when consumed as food. The biotechnical product obtainable by the method of the present invention does 
not cause an increase in the cholesterol level in 
blood, but will lower the blood cholesterol level. 
Patent claims are referred to for the 
characteristics of the invention. In this report, the prime meat means meat with 
protein content, obtained from animals (e.g. meat of a 
mammal, bird, reptile or fish or eggs), or fruit either 
containing or not containing protein, e.g. seeds, soybeans 
or so-called fruit pulp. The invention especially 
relates to meat from animals to be used in the manufacture 
of the biotechnical product or as its component, 
the corresponding product to be used as food as 
well as the corresponding method to lower the cholesterol 
level. The invention is based on the fact revealed by 
studies that omega-3,

A method for manufacturing a biotechnical product from prime meat, 
which means meat with protein content, obtained from animals, e.g. meat of a 

mammal, bird, reptile or fish or eggs, or fruit either containing or not containing 
protein, e.g. seeds, soybeans or so-called fruit pulp, said method comprising: 


forming a homogenized mixture comprising 40 - 80 wt-% prime meat, 3 - 
10 wt-% omega-3, omega-6 and/or omega-9 fatty acids, 8 - 20 wt-% bacteriostatic 

water, 3 - 8 wt-% starch and optionally 3- 8 wt-% other allowable additives by 
treating this mixture by cutting and/or grinding in temperatures under 27 °C with 

treating time 5 - 8 minutes so that the mixture forms a colloid that has a particle size 
between 1 - 100 nm (1 - 100 mµ), and after treatment pH of the resulting biotechnical 

product is between 5,6 - 6,5 and this product forms a rheological mass. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the mixture to be homogenized 
contains 4 - 6 wt-% omega-3, omega-6 and/or omega-9 fatty acids. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the homogenization is 
performed in temperature between 17 - 25°C. 
A method according to claims 1 - 3, wherein the mixture to be homogenized 
contains 50 - 70 wt-% prime meat. 
A method according to claims 1 - 4, wherein the mixture to be homogenized 
contains 4 - 6 wt % starch and optionally 4 - 6 wt-% other allowable 

additives. 
A method according to claims 1 - 5, wherein the mixture to be homogenized 
contains 10 - 20 wt-% added bacteriostatic water. 
A method according to claims 1 - 6, wherein the mixture to be homogenized 
is essentially free from added saturatedfatty acids, cholesterol, sugar 

and/or lactose and its derivatives.
