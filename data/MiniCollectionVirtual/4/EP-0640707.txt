<ABSTRACT>
Each design data of intarsia, jacquard, and structural 
stitches is separately stored and independently processed. Each 

design data is stored in an internal data format (22) where one 
pixel is allocated to each loop and is compensated for the aspect 

ratio of loops by affine transformation (24) before being displayed 
on a monitor (30). Similarly input coordinates from a stylus (16) 

are inputted in a coordinate system corresponding to the internal 
data format and then converted into monitor address with coordinate 

affine transformation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a knit design system
and a method for designing knit fabrics. Knit fabrics refer
not only to fashioned garments such as sweaters but to
non-fashioned fabrics. Knit fabrics also refer to flat,
warp, circular knitting and so forth.The assignee has proposed a system for designing knit
fabrics on the monitor screen (Japanese Patent Hei3-21661,
corresponding US-A- 4608642). The system has a frame
memory for recording knitting data in the course of
designing. Each loop in the design corresponds to a pixel in
the frame memory for example, and pixel colors represent the
species of stitches. When the color space of the frame
memory comprises 256 colors for example, each pixel may 
represent one of the 256 stitch types. The species of yarns
are designated optionally for each stitch type. Once the
design is completed, the system converts knitting data in
the frame memory into control data for controlling knitting
machines automatically with a look-up table for example.The system records every data of intarsia, jacquard, and
other stitch types about a loop as color data and stores
them into one pixel in the frame memory. Therefore,
individual data for intarsia, jacquard, and other stitch
types may not be separately treated. It restricts
flexibility of copying, moving, and deleting stitch data.
For example, such individual data as cable pattern, pocket
pattern, button hole pattern and so on, may not be separated
from an original design or transferred into another design.
Stitch data are recorded without distinction between stitch
types, and design data are lost by copying unless all stitch
data are copied. For example, the stitch patterns of
intarsia or jacquard alone may not be copied from one design
into another without copying all other data of the stitches.Similar problems occur when copying, moving, deleting,
or altering stitch data within a design. If pocket stitch
data are recorded over an intarsia stitch pattern for
example, the pocket has to be transferred with the intarsia
pattern. Likewise, if the intarsia pattern is changed, the
pocket stitch data will be lost. Since all data in 
designated pixels have to be deleted at the same time, it is
impossible to delete only the pocket stitch data without
altering other pattern data in the designated pixels. It
further restricts flexibility of grading, since pockets or
button holes may not be easily transferred or altered for
example.Since all data of a stitch such as intarsia, jacquard,
and other stitch types are not separately
