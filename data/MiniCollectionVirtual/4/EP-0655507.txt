<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a process for the manufacture of crystalline sugar from an aqueous sugar juice (liquor) containing sugars and organic and inorganic impurities, including Ca
<
2+
>
 and/or Mg
<
2+
>
 ions, such as a sugar cane juice or a sugar beet juice, which comprises the operations:   (a) of concentrating the said sugar juice, in order to obtain a syrup, and (b) of crystallising the said syrup, in order to obtain a crystalline sugar and a molasses, characterised in that it additionally comprises an operation: (c) of tangential microfiltration, of tangential ultrafiltration or of tangential nanofiltration, this operation being carried out before the operation (a).   Another subject of the invention is a process for the manufacture of crystalline white sugar from a sugar juice of the sugar cane juice type, comprising the abovementioned process for the manufacture of crystalline sugar, completed by remelting, decolorisation and crystallisation operations.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of crystallized sugar
from an aqueous sugar juice containing sugars and organic

and mineral impurities, including Ca
2+
 and/or Mg
2+
 ions, such
as a sugar cane or sugar beet juice, comprising the

operation :

of tangential microfiltration, tangential
ultrafiltration or tangential nanofiltration of said aqueous

sugar juice to obtain a permeat and a retentat,
of concentration of the permeat only, to obtain a
syrup,
of crystallization of said syrup, to obtain a crystal
sugar and a molasses, and
of separation of said crystal sugar from said
molasses,

said process being free of any purification operation
between the operation of tangential filtration and the

operation of concentration.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 it also comprises a softening operation, this operation
being carried out on the permeat before the latter is

submitted to the operation of concentration.
A process according to claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the softening operation is effected by bringing said
permeat into contact with a cation exchange resin.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the operation of crystallization is
followed by an operation of chromatography of said molasses

to give a first sugar-depleted liquid effluent and a second
sugar-enriched liquid effluent. 
A process according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
in that
 it also comprises an operation of regeneration of
the cation exchange resin used in the operation of

chromatography, by bringing said resin into contact with the
molasses produced by the operation of crystallization or

with the first liquid effluent produced by the operation of
chromatography.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it also comprises a prior
clarification operation on the initial aqueous sugar juice

to give a clarified juice, the operation of tangential
microfiltration, ultrafiltration or nanofiltration then

being applied to this clarified juice.
A process according to claim 6, 
characterized in
that
 the clarification operation comprises a flocculation
step followed by a decantation step.
A process for the manufacture of white crystal sugar
from an aqueous sugar juice of the sugar cane juice type,

containing sugars and organic and mineral impurities,
including Ca
2+
 and/or Mg
2+
 ions, 
characterized in that
 it
comprises the process according to any one of claims 1 to 7

resulting in the production of a raw sugar, followed by the
operations :


of re-melt of the raw sugar to give a melt sugar,
of decolorization of the melt sugar to give a
decolorized melt sugar, and
of crystallization of the decolorized melt sugar to
give crystal white sugar.
