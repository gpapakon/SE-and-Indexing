 METHOD OF INHIBITING VIRAL REPLICATIONTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a method for selecting drugs suitable for use in inhibiting viral replication in vivo. The invention also relates to a method of inhibiting viral replication that involves the use of oligonucleotides complementary to specific regions of the genome of the target virus.BACKGROUNDOne rationale for antiviral chemotherapy is based on the use of antisense oligonucleotides to specifically inhibit viral expression (Agra al, in Prospects for Antisense Nucleic Acid Therapy for Cancer and AIDS, E. Wickstrom, Ed. (Liss, NY, 1991), pp. 145-158; Matsukura et al in Prospects for Antisense Nucleic Acid Therapy for Cancer and AIDS, E. Wickstrom, Ed. (Liss, N.Y., 1991), pp. 159-178). It has been demonstrated that phosphodiester oligonucleotides, complementary to HIV RNA, inhibit viral replication in early infected cells (Goodchild et al Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 85:5507 (1988); Zamecnik et al Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci (USA) 83:4143 (1986)) but not in chronically infected cells (Agrawal et al Proc . Natl . Acad. Sci . (USA) 86:7790 (1989)), mainly because of their nuclease susceptibility (Wickstrom, J. Biochem . Biophys . Methods 13:97 (1986)). Therefore, several chemically modified nuclease resistant analogs were developed and studied for their effectiveness in 

inhibition of HIV replication in tissue culture (Sarin et al Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . (USA) 85:7748 (1988); Zaia et al J. Virology 62:3914 (1988); Agrawal et al Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . (USA) , 85:7079 (1988)). Phosphorothioate modified oligomers inhibited HIV replication in both acute infection (when virus is added to an uninfected susceptible cell line) as well as in chronically infected cells (Agrawal et al Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . (USA) 86:7790 (1989) ; Agrawal in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews R. J. Juliano, Eds. (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1991); Matsukura et al Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . (USA) 84:7706 (1987); Matsukura et al, Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . (USA) 86:4244 (1989); Agrawal et al in Gene Regulation: Biology of Antisense RNA and DNA R. P. Erickson, J. G. Izant, Eds. (Raven Press, New York, 1992); Vickers et al Nucleic Acids Res . 19:3359 (1991); Kim et al Biochem . & Biophys . Res . Comm . 179:1614 (1991)). Interpretation of these results, however, has been hampered by the fact that even mismatched oligomers have inhibitory activity. At low concentrations, the control oligomers were less effective than the complementary oligomers, but specificity and cytotoxicity remain to

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of preventing the formation of escape mutants in cells infected with a retrovirus comprising contacting said cells with at least two antisense oligonucleotides complementary to different regions of the retrovirus genome, wherein said oligonucleotides are sequentially contacted with said cells under conditions such that replication of said retrovirus is inhibited whereby a first of said at least two oligonucleotides is contacted first with said cells and subsequently a second of said at least two oligonucleotides is contacted with said cells.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein at least one of said oligonucleotides is complementary to a conserved region of the retrovirus genome.
3. The method according to claim 1 wherein at least one of said oligonucleotides is complementary to rev mRNA.
4. The method according to claim 1 wherein at least one of said oligonucleotides is complementary to gag coding sequence and packaging signal.
5. The method according to claim 1 wherein at least one of said oligonucleotides is complementary to RRE.
6. The method according to claim 1 wherein said oligonucleotide is a chemically modified. 


 7. The method according to claim 1 wherein said oligonucleotide is about 28 bases long.
8. The method according to claim l wherein said retrovirus is HIV.
9. An in vitro culture system for testing an anti-viral agent comprising: i) contacting a culture of cells susceptible to infection with a virus to said virus under conditions such that infection of said cells is effected to the extent that infection with said virus occurs in vivo; ii) contacting said infected cells resulting from step (i) with different concentrations of an agent to be tested; iii) culturing said infected cells for a time period that corresponds to an in vivo treatment protocol for said virus and determining which of said concentrations inhibits replication of said virus throughout said time period.
. 10. The method according to claim 9 wherein said virus is HIV and said anti-viral agent is an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to a functional region of the HIV genome.
