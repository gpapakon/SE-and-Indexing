<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a plasma processing 
apparatus including a wafer supporting pedestal (30) which 

is designed to reduce particle trapping phenomena. In a 
region of the pedestal surface which surrounds or abuts 

the wafer (10), the pedestal has a cover (40) in the form 
of a flat annular disk. The cover is formed from a 

material having a permittivity which is substantially 
equal to or greater than that of the wafer surface. As a 

result, the sheath boundary is reshaped to reduce particle 
trapping.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to control of contaminating
particles in materials processing.In a sputter or reactive ion etching or chemical
vapor deposition apparatus used in semiconductor
manufacturing, a semiconductor wafer is placed between two
electrodes which are driven by a radio frequency (RF) AC
voltage source. (Ordinarily the wafer is placed directly
over one electrode and a substantial distance from the other
electrode.) A reactant gas is released into the chamber in
the area above the wafer. Because the reactant molecules
are relatively large and immobile, they cannot move in
response to the rapidly fluctuating electric fields.
However, the electrons associated with the reactant
molecules are relatively mobile. As a result, if the AC
electric fields are sufficiently intense, electrons are
stripped from the reactant molecules, forming a gas plasma
of free electrons and positive reactant ions. This plasma
is highly conductive because it contains a large number of
free carriers, and therefore is essentially an equipotential
region.Ions have a much larger mass than electrons; in
fact, ions are so massive that they are essentially
unaffected by the RF AC electric fields; however, due to
their smaller mass, free electrons are rapidly accelerated
by the RF AC electric fields. Note, however, that because
the plasma is an equipotential region, electrons within the
plasma are not influenced by the RF AC electric fields; only
those which reach the edge of the region between the plasma
and the wafer -- the "plasma sheath" -- are accelerated. When the RF AC source is first turned on, the wafer
and electrode surfaces contain no charge. In the first half
of the AC cycle the electrode immediately underneath the
wafer has a positive voltage, and the wafer surface attracts
electrons and repels ions. During this half of the cycle,
electrons are accelerated from the sheath onto the wafer,
where they join other electrons in one of the energy bands
of the wafer's semiconductor material. In the second half
of the AC cycle, the electrode underneath the wafer has a
negative voltage, which attracts positive ions toward the
wafer and repels electrons. However, relatively few of the
electrons on the wafer develop the necessary energy to leave
the energy bands of the wafer and return to a free energy
state within the plasma. Thus, during the first and
subsequent AC cycles, electrons are collected on the wafer
surface.This accumulation of negative charge causes the
wafer to "self bias" to a negative DC voltage relative to
the
