<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises a gear lever (gear shift lever) (14) mounted in an articulated manner in the passenger compartment (cabin, cockpit) of the vehicle, fitted with a pommel (knob) (15) which can be moved in a so-called transverse direction for operating a moving member (36) for selecting ratios in the gearbox, and in a direction substantially perpendicular to the previous one, termed longitudinal, for operating a moving member (38) for changing ratios in the gearbox. The movements of the moving change member (38) are controlled by a linkage (40) for transmitting the longitudinal movements of the pommel (15) connecting the gear lever (14) and the moving change member (38), and the movements of the moving selection member (36) are controlled by electric and/or fluid-type actuator means (52), the energy supply to which is under the control of the means actuated by the transverse movements of the pommel (15).

Apparatus for controlling a gearbox (12) of a motor 
vehicle, of the type comprising a gear change lever (14) 

articulatedly mounted in the cab of the vehicle, 
provided with a knob (15) which is movable in a 

direction, known as the transverse direction, to control 
a movable member (36) for selecting ratios in the 

gearbox, and in a direction substantially perpendicular 
to the previous one, referred t
o as the longitudinal 
direction, for controlling a movable member (38) for 

changing between the ratios of the gearbox, the 
movements of the movable change member (38) being 

controlled by a linkage (40) for transmitting the 
longitudinal movements of the knob (15) connecting the 

gear change lever (14) and the movable change member 
(38), characterised in that the movements of the movable 

selecting member (36), for selecting a ratio, are 
controlled by electric actuating means (52) the energy 

supply of which is controlled by means (50) actuated by 
transverse displacements of the knob (15), in that the 

means for controlling the energy supply to the actuating 
means (52) comprise electric switching means (50) the 

different posiions of which are selected by the 
transverse displacement of the knob (15), in that the 

knob (15) is movable between two extreme transverse 
positions corresponding to two extreme positions of the 

switching means (50) which impose, respectively, 
opposite actions of the actuating means (52), and in 

that the actuating means (52) comprise two electrical 
actuators (62, 64) each provided with a movable 

actuating member (62A, 62B) co-operating with the 
movable selecting member (36), the movable actuating 

means (62A, 64A) being displaceable in a linear manner 
when the actuators (62, 64) are activated 

so as to act on the movable selecting member (36) in 
opposite directions and being resiliently biased back 

towards a resting position of the movable selecting  
 

member (36) when the actuators are idle, the switching 
means (50) in their extreme positions respectively 

actuating one or other of the actuators (62, 64). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the gear change lever (14) is articulated about a 

substantially transverse axis (T) and the knob (15) is 
articulated on the lever (14) about a substantially 

longitudinal axis (L), being resiliently biased back 
towards a resting position, the means (50) for 

controlling the energy supply to the actuating means 
(52) being arranged in the knob (15). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it further comprises means for 

selecting a reverse gear ratio which are controlled by a 
member (80; 82) mounted on the gear change lever (14) 

and actuated by pushing or pulling coaxially with this 
lever (14). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the gear change lever (14) 

is articulated on a median longitudinal part of the 
floor of the cab, forming a console (66) which is raised 

relative to the rest of the floor, the console (66) 
comprising a container (68), accessible from the cab, 

and a space (74) for longitudinal movement of a hidden 
lower part of the lever (14) delimited by the 

longitudinal walls (70, 72) of the console and 
container. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the gear change lever (14) 

is articulated on a steering column assembly, underneath 
a steering wheel connected to this column, so that the 

movements of the knob (15), in the longitudinal 
direction of movement between ratios, are substantially  

 
perpendicular to the general axis of the steering 

column.
