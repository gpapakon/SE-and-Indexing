<ABSTRACT>
Solenoid valve with a valve body 15, a coil sleeve 16 which is arranged thereon and on which a coil is seated and a housing 18 which encloses the coil and holds it on the valve body 15 with axial pretensioning. An armature is arranged and spring loaded in an axially displaceable fashion in the coil sleeve 16 and the valve body 15. Between the valve body 15 and the arrangement consisting of coil sleeve 16 and coil a device is provided which produces axial pretensioning between them, this device being formed in particular by a radial coil sleeve flange 44 being shaped in the manner of a plate spring and pressed flat on the valve body 15 during the assembly of the housing 18 so that it exerts axial pretensioning.

Solenoid valve with 

a valve body (15) 
a coil sleeve (16), which is disposed 
on the valve body (15) and on which there bears a 

coil (17) consisting of a coil body and a coil 
winding; 
a casing (18), which surrounds the coil 
(17) and retains it on the valve body (15) by an 

axial bias; 
an anchor (23), which is disposed in 
the coil sleeve end in the valve body in an 

axially displaceable and spring-loaded manner; and 
a device provided between the valve 
body (15) and the arrangement consisting of the 

coil sleeve (16) and the coil (17) which generates 
an axial bias between them, characterised in that 

this device consists of a radial coil sleeve 
flange (44) which is formed in the manner of a 

radial disc spring which, under axial bias, is 
pressed flat in the solenoid valve.
