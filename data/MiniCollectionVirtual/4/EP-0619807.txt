 New BHT Ether Compounds and their Use as Hypolipidemic and Antiatherosclerotic DrugsFIELD OF THE INVENTION Hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and use thereof.BACKGROUND OF INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTSince the beginning of medical history, athero- sclerosis has been described as an important disease.However, only in the twentieth century was it discovered- that myocardial infarction is always associated with coronary atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Epidemiologic studies carried out in the seventies have shown that about fifty percent of all mortalities in the Western industrial¬ ized countries are caused by cardiovascular disease.The most important factors in the development of atherosclerosis are known. The importance of elevated cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations was discovered early. Cholesterol and triglycerides are transported in the form of so-called lipoproteins, the cholesterol-rich low-density (LDL) and triglyceride-rich very low-density (VLDL) fractions of which are considered as atherogenic if their concentrations in the blood are increased. However, only recently was it discovered that in addition to their amount, the "quality" of LDL is also decisive. Thus, in animal experiments it could be shown that equally high concentrations of LDL cholesterol were more or less atherogenic depending upon the properties of the drug applied to reduce the elevated LDL cholesterol level. The cause of this finding could also be shown by the authors, namely, a drug which was also able to reduce LDL oxidation was most effective in counteracting atherosclero- 

 sis. (Carew et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 84. 7725-7729 (November 1987.)) This experiment impressively demonstrates the importance of LDL "quality". In the body, LDL and VLDL are subject to continual oxidation which is physiologically balanced by natural so-called antioxidants such as toco- pherol or ascorbic acid. However, in the case of increased LDL (cholesterol) and VLDL (triglyceride) values, this homeostasis is disturbed and shifted in favor of an in¬ creasing tendency towards oxidation. Therefore, the risk of development and manifestation of atherosclerosis is increased by two factors:- elevated concentration of so-called atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL,. VLDL) and- their content*of oxidation products (e.g., oxidized lipids).Causal treatment must, therefore, influence both actors.Apart from the humoral factors, namely the lipopro¬ teins, the cellular constituents of the vascular wall play
