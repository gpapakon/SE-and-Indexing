<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to method for preparing a metallocene catalyst system for the polymerization of
olefins, and more particularly to a process to support metallocene catalysts on inert
mediums.Homogeneous or non-supported metallocene and organoaluminum catalyst
systems are known and exploited for their high catalytic activity when employed in
olefin polymerization and for their ability to produce polymers with terminal
unsaturation. However, these homogeneous catalyst systems suffer from the limiting
disadvantage of producing polymer which sticks to the reactor walls during the
polymerization process or polymer having small particle size and low bulk density which
limit their commercial utility. Typically, polymer particle size and bulk density are
determined by the morphological properties of the catalyst solid component [i.e. an inert
carrier or supported media]. Absent a solid component in the polymerization media,
inferior particle size of the final polymer product results. Obtaining a useful supported
catalyst for metallocene/alumoxane systems has been a problem in the past. Likewise,
maintaining commercially acceptable levels of catalyst activity with minimal levels of
reactor fouling occurring during polymerization, is also a problem.Methods known in the art to obtain polymer product having uniform, compact
spherical particles, narrow particle size distribution and/or high bulk density, include:
(1) preactivating or precontacting the metallocene and organoaluminum (EPA 302,424,
EPA 354,893); (2) prepolymerizing a heterogeneous catalyst system in the presence of
at least one olefin (EPA 426,646, US 4,871,705); (3) utilizing finally divided alumoxane
to yield a powdery polymer (EPA 279,586); (4) utilizing a supported catalyst system and
fillers in the catalyst system with affinities for polyolefins (EPA 314,797); and (5)
prepolymerizing a supported metallocene catalyst to increase particle size (EPA
347,128). Although meeting their objective, these techniques suffer due to either
unacceptable levels of reactor fouling which occur during polymerization, low catalyst
activity or producing a polymer having too small particles or broad molecular weight.Various techniques for making supported catalyst systems known in the art
include the following preparations of supported metallocene catalyst systems (EPA
518,092, WO 87-03889, and WO 91/09812). Chang describes various methods for 
preparing heterogeneous catalyst using hydrated carriers or a wet monomer (EPA
367,503, EPA 336,593, US 4,192,075).
