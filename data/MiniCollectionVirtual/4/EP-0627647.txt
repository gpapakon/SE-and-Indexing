<ABSTRACT>
In a progressive multifocal lens of the present 
invention, the values of a curvature ρm of a refracting 

surface along the principal meridional curve and a 
curvature ρs of the refracting surface in a direction 

perpendicular to the principal meridional curve become 
maximum at approximately the center of a nearsight 

portion on the principal meridional curve, decrease 
toward the peripheral region of the nearsight portion 

along the principal meridional curve, are substantially 
different from each other at least from the lower 

portion of a farsight portion to approximately the 
center of a intermediate portion, are substantially 

equivalent from approximately the center of the 
intermediate portion to the lower portion of the 

intermediate portion, and are substantially different 
from each other from the lowest portion of the 

intermediate portion and the nearsight portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a progressive
multifocal lens used to assist an accommodation power
of an eye.As spectacle lenses for assisting an accommodation
power when an accommodation power of an eye becomes too
weak to see a near point, various progressive
multifocal lenses have been known. A progressive
multifocal lens of this type has a "farsight portion",
a "nearsight portion" and a progressive region
(referred to as an "intermediate portion" hereinafter)
which is located between the above two portions in
which a refracting power is continuously changed. When
the progressive multifocal lens is actually worn as
spectacles by a user, the farsight portion becomes an
upper portion while the nearsight portion becomes a
lower portion. In the present invention, it is to be
noted that "upper portion", "lower portion",
"horizontal" and "vertical" are used to point positions
of the progressive multifocal lens in the state that it
is actually worn by the user. For example, the lower
portion of the farsight portion is a position within
the farsight portion close to the intermediate portion. 
Also, the difference between the nearsight refracting
power and the farsight refracting power is called an
additional power.In a progressive multifocal lens of this type, in
general, when wide distinct vision areas (ranges with
an astigmatic difference of 0.5 diopter or less) of the
farsight and nearsight portions are kept and coupled by
the progressive power range, lens aberrations are
concentrated on side portions of the progressive power
range. As a result, blurring and distortion of an
image occur in these side portions. Therefore, when a
user wears spectacles formed of these multifocal lenses
and shifts his eyes laterally, he perceives the
distortion of an image as the fluctuation of the image
and has an unpleasant feeling.In order to prevent such a problem of visual
characteristics, in known progressive power lenses,
various designs and evaluations have been made from a
variety of viewpoints. As for the shape of a lens
surface, an intersecting line (principal meridional
curve) defined by a section extending along a vertical
meridian vertically passing through substantially the
center of a lens surface and an object-side lens
surface is used as a reference line for expressing
specifications such as an additional power of a lens,
and is also used as an important reference line in a
lens design. As shown in Fig. 1, a progressive multifocal lens
has been proposed in which an intermediate portion P
