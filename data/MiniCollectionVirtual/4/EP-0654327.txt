<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a device for the exact determination of the position of a flexible actuator, for example a robot arm which can be expanded, contracted and bent as desired. This robot arm is equipped on its flexible limbs with vibration pickups, for this purpose. Along these vibration pickups a vibration carrier, for example a steel cable, is displaceably guided through guiding eyes in which these vibration pickups are fitted. This steel cable is then excited, for example with a vibration, such as for example ultrasound or mechanical vibrations. This vibration propagates along said vibration carrier at its speed of propagation. From the propagation times of the vibration to the individual vibration pickups, the distance between the respective vibration pickups is determined via an evaluating unit to which all the vibration pickups are connected. Such a vibration carrier can be, for example, a steel cable which actuates an actuator. In this case, the speed of propagation of the vibration also depends on the mechanical pretension of this steel cable. In order to be able to determine this speed of propagation in dependence on this tension, it is furthermore provided in the invention that the speed of propagation be measured along a cable piece of constant length by measuring the propagation time there. This speed of propagation of the vibration determined there then forms the basis for further calculations of the part-lengths between the other vibration pickups on this steel cable. Vibration pickups may be of capacitive or inductive type. What is important is that only part of the vibration energy is dissipated from the steel cable so that there is still sufficient vibration energy available at the end of the actuator for the vibration pickups situated there. Areas of application of the invention are, for example, domestic robots or industrial minirobots, or autonomous vacuum cleaners.

Arrangement for the determination of at least one variable part length of at least
one strand guided tautly along an actuator,


a) in which at least one oscillation pick-up, at which the strand is guided past to be
freely displaceable, is fastened to the actuator for each part length to be

determined.
b) in which an oscillation sender, which gives an oscillation on the strand, is arranged
at a reference position at the actuator.
c) and in which an evaluating unit is provided, which is connected with the at least
one oscillation pick-up by way of signal lines and which determines a first variable

part length from the speed of propagation of the oscillation and the transit time of
the oscillation from the reference position up to at least one oscillation pick-up.
Arrangement according to claim 1,in which the one part length is provided with a
constant length for determination of the speed of propagation of the oscillation.
Arrangement according to one of the above claims, in which at least one
capacitive, inductive or piezo-ceramic oscillation pick-up is provided.
Arrangement as claimed in claim 3,

a) in which at least two layers of a conductive material disposed one above the other
are provided as capacitive oscillation pick-up and are connected together by way of

an elastic non-conductive layer, so that they form a capacitor,
b) in which one of the layers is connected with the strand and another with the
actuator,
c) and in which the oscillation generates an alternating voltage, which is fed to the
evaluating unit.
Arrangement according to claim 3,

a) in which a coil and a permanent magnet are arranged adjacent to one another, one
above the other or one within the other as inductive oscillation pick-up,
b) in which one of the two is connected with the strand and the other with the
actuator,

evaluating unit.
Arrangement according to one of the above claims, in which at least one
capacitive, inductive or piezo-ceramic oscillation sender is provided.
Arrangement according to one of the above claims,

a) in which the oscillation pick-up is fastened to guide eyes, which are arranged at
coils of an actuator in the form of a helical spring, wherein a movement of the

actuator in different directions is generated thereby that at one end of the helical
spring tension strands are fixed, which are guided along the spring through the

guide eyes and issue freely at the other end,
b) and in which the oscillation sender excites the tension strands by an oscillation.
