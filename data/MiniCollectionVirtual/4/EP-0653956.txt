<ABSTRACT>
An improved catalytic converter (10) is provided particularly for use in reducing the ozone content of an air flow stream supplied to an aircraft environmental control system (12) for cabin pressurization and/or air-conditioning. The catalytic converter (10) comprises one or more plate-fin elements (32) coated with a selected catalyst (40) and arranged within a housing (20) in a generally cylindrical concentric ring or spiral wrap configuration. The plate-fin element (132) or elements (32) define an axial succession of fin rows (38) wherein the fins of each row are offset relative to the fins of each adjacent row.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to 
improvements in catalytic converters, particularly of 
the type used in combination with an aircraft cabin 
environmental control system to reduce or eliminate 
ozone in conditioned air supplied to an aircraft 
cabin space. Environmental control systems for aircraft 
are generally known in the art for supplying 
pressurized and conditioned air to an aircraft cabin 
space. In such systems, a bleed air flow obtained 
from an engine compressor stage is often used as a 
source of fresh air for supply to the aircraft cabin 
space at a selected temperature, pressure, and 
relative humidity. In some cases, the engine bleed 
air is supplemented by a flow of fresh outside air. 
Environmental control systems of this type are 
provided to enhance the comfort of flight crew and 
passengers within the aircraft, especially in the 
course of relatively high altitude flight operations. Modern jet aircraft are typically designed 
for fuel-efficient operation at relatively high 
altitudes on the order of 25,000 feet or more above 
sea level. At such altitudes, the ozone content in 
ambient air is relatively high. As a result, the air 
flow stream supplied to the aircraft environmental  
 
control system exhibits a substantial ozone content. 
Ozone is widely recognized as an air pollutant, and 
can cause lung and eye irritation, headaches, fatigue 
and/or breathing discomfort in humans. Catalytic converter devices have been used 
in aircraft applications to reduce or eliminate 
undesirable ozone in an air flow stream supplied to 
the aircraft cabin space by converting the ozone to 
oxygen. Such converters typically include a catalyst 
bed exposed to the air flow stream for purposes of 
decomposing ozone to oxygen. Such converters have 
unfortunately been relatively large in terms of size 
and weight in order to achieve the requisite mass 
transfer between the gaseous air flow stream and the 
solid catalyst. The present invention relates to an improved 
catalytic ozone converter of compact size and 
lightweight construction, while providing highly 
efficient ozone decomposition with relatively minimal 
converter pressure drop. In accordance with the invention, an 
improved catalytic converter is provided for reducing 
the ozone content of an air flow stream supplied to 
an aircraft cabin space for purposes of cabin 
pressurization and/or air-conditioning. The 
catalytic converter comprises one or more plate-fin 
elements coated with a selected catalyst and retained 
within a housing

<CLAIMS>
In combination with an aircraft environmental 
control system (12) for receiving an ozone-containing air 

flow stream used for environmental control of an aircraft 
cabin space (14), a catalytic ozone converter (10), 

comprising:
 
   a housing (20) having open inlet and outlet ends (22, 

24) to permit axial flow-through passage of the ozone-containing 
air flow stream; and
 
   a converter core (30) mounted within said housing 

(20), characterized in that:
 
   said housing has a diametrically expanding inflow 

segment (26) merging smoothly with a cylindrical segment 
(28) of circular cross-section which, in turn, merges 

smoothly with a tapered outflow segment of rapidly reducing 
diametric size,
 
   said converter core (30) has a generally cylindrical 

shape and is mounted within said cylindrical segment (28) 
of the housing,
 
   said converter core includes at least one plate-fin 

element (32), formed from a lightweight metal stamping and 
having a coating of an ozone decomposition catalyst 

thereon, said element (32) defining a plurality of fins 
arranged in an axial succession of rows (38) with the fins 

of each row being offset with respect to the fins of each 
adjacent row. 
The catalytic ozone converter (10) of claim 1 
wherein said at least one plate-fin element (32) comprises 

a plurality of plate-fin elements arranged in a packed 
configuration of substantially concentric rings. 
The catalytic ozone converter (10) of claim 1 
wherein said at least one plate-fin element (32) comprises 

a unitary plate-fin element (132) wrapped upon itself in a 
spiral configuration.
