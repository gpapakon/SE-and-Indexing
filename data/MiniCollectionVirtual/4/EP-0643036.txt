<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of pimelic acid esters of aliphatic or aromatic alcohols, the esters having 0 to 3 alkyl substituents, in which process an optionally alkyl-substituted cyclohexanone is carboxylated in a manner known per se to give the corresponding 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate and simultaneously or subsequently the corresponding salt is formed in the presence of a strong base, this salt being reacted with an alcohol at temperatures from 50-250 DEG C with ring-opening taking place.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of esters of pimelic 
acid, containing from 0 to 3 alkyl substituents, with 

aliphatic or aromatic alcohols, characterized in that, in a 
manner known per se, a cyclohexanone which is substituted, 

if desired, by alkyl is carboxylated to give the 
corresponding 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylic ester and at the 

same time or subsequently the corresponding salt is formed 
in the presence of a strong base, the salt being subjected 

to ring-opening reaction with an alcohol at temperatures of 
50 - 250Â°C. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that aliphatic, branched or unbranched alcohols having 1 to 

10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or 
araliphatic alcohols having 7 to 12 carbon atoms are 

employed. 
A process according to either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that from 1 to 20 equivalents of alcohol 

are employed per equivalent or 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylic 
ester or salts thereof. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, in the reaction, the base used is an 

alkali metal alcoholate, preferably that of the alcohol 
employed, in a quantity of 1 to 3 equivalents per equivalent 

of 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylic ester. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the alkyl substituents of the pimelic 

ester are C
1
-C
6
 hydrocarbon radicals. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the reaction is carried out above the 

boiling point of the corresponding alcohols, under pressure 
if desired.  

 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the base is added, in portions or 

continuously, preferably in solid form or in the form of an 
alcoholic solution of alkali metal alcoholate under the 

reaction conditions according to the invention. 
A process for the preparation of pimelic esters of 
aliphatic or araliphatic alcohols according to claim 1, 

characterized in that, in a first reaction step, 
cyclohexanone is reacted with dialkyl carbonate using a 

strong base, preferably using alkali metal alcoholate, to 
give the salt of the 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylic ester, which 

salt is not isolated before further treatment. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the reaction is carried out also in 

the presence of a solvent, preferably aromatic, aliphatic or 
alicyclic hydrocarbons, aliphatic or aromatically 

substituted ethers, fatty alcohols and cyclic 
carbonates.
