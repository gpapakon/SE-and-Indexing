A device for metered delivery of liquid or viscous substances to a consumption 
point, and in particular of lubricating substances to a lubrication point, 

comprising: 

a container (8) for receiving an amount of the substance to be delivered; 
an outlet (70), through which the substance, contained in the container, can be 
delivered to the consumption point; 
a delivery means, which comprises a displacement element (30; 230; 305), 
which may be moved by the elastic return force of a deformable accumulator 

(54) from a first position (OT) into a second position (UT), said substance being 
deliverable from said container through said outlet to said consumption point 

during said movement from said first (OT) to that second position (UT); 
a drive means (80, 82, 86, 87, 90, 91), by which said displacement element can 
be moved against said elastic return force of said deformable accumulator from 

said second position (UT) into said first position (OT); 
an adjusting element (69; 270; 412) which influences the amount of the 
substance to be delivered to said consumption point; and 
at least two parts which are separable from each other, said first part (2, 3, 4) 
comprising that container (8) and said second part (60; 62; 400) comprising at 

least said adjusting element (69; 270; 412); 
characterized in that
a control means (102) is provided which effects said movement of said 
displacement element from said second (UT) to said first position (OT) based 

on the signals of a timer in a predetermined time interval such that a  
 

predetermined amount of said substance is delivered per time unit to said 
consumption point. 
A device according to claim 1 characterized in said adjusting element (412) 
adjusts the time interval in which said control means (102) effects said 

movement of said displacement element (30; 230; 305) from said second (UT) 
into said first position (OT). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said adjusting element 
(69; 270) determines which volume is displaced upon actuation of said 

displacement element (30; 230; 305). 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that a first adjusting 
element (412) adjusts said time interval in which said control means effects said 

movement of said displacement element (30; 230; 305) from said second (UT) 
into said first position (OT), and in that a second adjusting element (69, 270) 

determines which volume is displaced upon actuation of said displacement 
element (30; 230; 305). 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said 
accumulator is designed as a spring (54). 
A device according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
said delivery means comprises a piston (30; 230; 305) guided in a cylinder (19; 

219; 300) which reduces the volume in the cylinder when moved from said first 
position (OT) into said second position (UT) and thereby effects the delivery 
of 
the substance to be delivered. 
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that said piston (30; 230; 305) is 
hollow. 
A device according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that said piston (30; 230; 
305) operates with a stop (69, 270) forming an adjusting element which defines 

the volume of substance which is displaced upon each piston stroke.  
 
A device according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
said drive means comprises an electric motor (80) for moving said 

displacement element from said second position (UT) into said first position 
(OT), said electric motor being connected by a motion transmitting means (50, 

83, 86, 87, 89, 90, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97) with said accumulator. 
A device according to claims 6 and 9, characterized in that said piston (30, 230) 
comprises a pushing element (50, 250) cooperating with said motion 

transmitting means and that said motion transmitting means further includes a 
rotatable disc (92) which has at least one cam element (94, 95, 96, 97) which 

cooperates with said pushing element (50), for displacing said piston from said 
second (UT) into said first (OT) position by rotating said disc. 
A device according to claim 10, characterized in that said disc comprises four 
cam elements (94, 95, 96, 97) arranged at equal angular distance with respect 

to each other on said disc, and that said disc is rotated by 90Â° for moving said 
piston from said second position (UT) into said first position (OT). 
A device according to claim 10 or 11, characterized in that said pushing 
element (50, 250) and said cam element (94, 95, 96, 97) are designed such 

that said piston (30, 230) is moved into said first position (OT), independent of 
said position in which it has reached said second position (UT). 
A device according to at least one of claims 9 to 12, characterized in that said 
motion transmitting means comprises a multistage gear connecting said electric 

motor (80) with said disc (92). 
A device according to at least one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that said 
container (8) for receiving the substance to be delivered is designed 

substantially cylindrically and comprises a substantially cylindrical flexible sack 
(10,110) for receiving said substance. 
A device according to claim 14, characterized in that said sack is connected by 
a tubular member, precluding into the container, said tubular member having a 

sharp edge (23), with said delivery device.  
 
A device according to claim 14, characterized in that said connection of said 
flexible sack (110) with said delivery means is by means of a thread means 

(112, 122) provided on said flexible sack and on said delivery means. 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that said adjusting element 
is designed as projection (412) which is fixed on said second part and that said 

adjusting element cooperates with a circuit means connected to said control 
means. 
A method for metered delivery of a lubricating substance to a lubrication point 
using a means according to one of claims 1 to 17, comprising the steps of: 


screwing said second part (60) into a threaded bore of said lubrication point to 
be delivered; 
inserting said lubricating substance to be delivered into said container (8) of 
said first part (2, 3, 4) and therebefore or thereafter; 
joining said first (2, 3, 4) and said second part (60); 
delivering said lubricating substance to said lubrication point by moving said 
displacement element (30) in predetermined time intervals by said drive means 

from said second position (UT) into said first position (OT) and thereafter by 
said return force of said deformable accumulator (54) from said first (OT) into 

said second position (UT), whereby a predetermined volume of said lubricating 
substance is delivered per time unit from said displacement element (30) to 

said lubrication point. 
A method according to claim 18, characterized in that said inserting of said 
lubricating substance is arranged by inserting a flexible sack (10; 110) filled with 

said lubricating substance into said container. 
A method according to claim 19, characterized in that said flexible sack (10; 
110) is loaded with a spring (13) whereby a small pressure is imparted onto
