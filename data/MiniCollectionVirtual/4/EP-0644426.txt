<ABSTRACT>
Analyser having a device for suspending particles, the analyser containing a transport device which allows positioning of the pipette needle (18) at a distance (e) from the central longitudinal axis (22) of the reaction vessel (8). Particle-suspension is carried out by partial release of reagent liquid at two different positions at a distance (e) from the central longitudinal axis (22) of a reaction vessel (8), a flow being produced in the reaction vessel, which flow allows particle-suspension exclusively by injecting reagent, so that a subsequent agitation process can be dispensed with.

Process for suspending particles which are
located in a reaction vessel, wherein a

predetermined volume of a reagent liquid is
added to the reaction vessel by means of a

pipetting needle which can be moved by a
transport device,
characterised in that

the pipetting needle (18) is brought by the
transport device (13) to a first position at a

first distance (e) from the central
longitudinal axis (22) of the reaction vessel

(8),

with the pipetting needle (18) in this first
position a part of the predetermined volume of

the reagent liquid (21) is injected into the
reaction vessel (8) forming a first eddy (24),

wherein the position of the pipetting needle
(18) in the reagent glass (8) remains unchanged

during the injection,

the pipetting needle (18) is brought to a
second position at a second distance (e) from

the central longitudinal axis (22) of the
reaction vessel (8) by the transport device

(13), and

with the pipetting needle (18) at this second
position the remaining part of the

predetermined volume of the reagent liquid (21)
is injected into the reaction vessel (8)

forming a second eddy (25) which rotates in the 
opposition direction to the direction of

rotation of the first eddy (24).
Process for suspending particles as claimed in
claim 1, 
characterised in that
 with respect to
the central axis (22) of the reaction vessel

(8) the second position lies diametrically
opposite the first position.
Process for suspending particles as claimed in
claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the first and
the second position lie in the proximity of a

respective region of the second wall of the
reaction vessel (8) to which adhere particles

(19) which are to be suspended.
Suspension process as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the first
and second position are located at a

substantially equal distance (e) from the
central axis.
Process for suspending particles as claimed in
any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that

the particles (19) are magnetic microparticles.
Device for carrying out the process as claimed
in claim 1, having the following components:

a pipetting device (14) having a transport
device (13) which serves to move a pipetting

needle (18) in three mutually perpendicular
directions (x, y, z),
 
at least one reaction vessel (18) which has a

substantially cylindrical side wall, a central
longitudinal axis and a substantially spherical

base wall and contains the particles which are
to be suspended,

at least one processing station in which the
reaction vessel can be disposed and on which a

specific quantity of a reagent can be pipetted
through the pipetting needle into the reaction

vessel, wherein

the transport device (13) is arranged to
position the pipetting needle (18) in the

reaction vessel (8) in a first position, in
which a part of the predetermined quantity of

the reagent liquid is discharged, and
subsequently to position it in a second

position, in which the remaining part of the
reaction liquid is discharged, wherein in the

first and in the second position the pipetting
needle (18) is disposed parallel to and at a

specific distance (e) from the central axis
(22) of the reaction vessel (8).
Device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 in the first and in the second position
the pipetting needle is disposed between the

central longitudinal axis (22) of the reaction
vessel (8) and the wall of the reaction vessel

(8).
Device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 with respect to the central axis (22) of 
the reaction vessel (8) the second position

lies diametrically opposite the first position.
Device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the first and the second position lie in
the proximity of a respective region of the

side wall of the reaction vessel (8) to which
adhere particles (19) which are to be

suspended.
Device as claimed in claim 9, 
characterised in
that
 the particles (19) are magnetic
microparticles.
