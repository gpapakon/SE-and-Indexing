<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with ceramic materials. In particular, the
present invention is concerned with aqueous ceramic slurries, dry ceramic mixtures,
ceramic green bodies and sintered ceramic products prepared from such ceramic
green bodies, and is especially concerned with a method for improving ceramic
green bodies using selected binders. Ceramic green bodies prepared using these
selected binders have improved green strength and improved green density.Ceramic materials are often used to prepare lightweight, strong, thermally
and chemically resistant products useful as chromatographic media, grinding aids,
abrasives, catalysts, adsorbents, electronic components, construction components
and machine components.In the manufacture of ceramic products, ceramic materials in the form of a
powder are subjected to elevated pressures to produce what is known as a ceramic
green body. Methods for compacting, or subjecting the ceramic materials to elevated
pressures, to produce ceramic bodies include pressing, extrusion, roll compaction
and injection molding. Pressing methods include dry pressing, isostatic pressing
and semi-wet pressing. Using these methods, ceramic green bodies can be prepared
in various shapes and sizes. The size and shape of the green bodies can also be
altered by machining, cutting or stamping the green body.The properties of the green bodies generally affect the properties of the final
ceramic product. The final ceramic product is generally prepared by sintering the
ceramic green body. If the green density of the ceramic green body is too low, the
mechanical properties of the final ceramic product, such as hardness, will diminish.
If the green strength of the ceramic green body is too low, it becomes difficult or
impossible to process the ceramic green body. Thus, it is desirable to provide
ceramic green bodies with increased green densities and green strengths.One method for increasing green strengths of ceramic green bodies is to use a
binder as a processing aid in the preparation of ceramic green bodies. Currently, the
primary commercial binders used in the manufacture of ceramic green bodies are
polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA") and poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG"). These binders are
somewhat effective at increasing the green strength of ceramic green bodies.
However, PEG and PVA suffer from several drawbacks. PEG does not result in
particularly good green strength. PVA results in acceptable green strength, but
causes a lowering in green density. Also, these polymers are sensitive to
