<ABSTRACT>
A display controller is equipped with a video information storage 
medium containing at least two video objects, the 

storage medium being of type that allows to read out information 
related to the different video objects in parallel, an 

atrribute logic generating enable signals, a combination logic 
combining the outputs of said video inform 

                                   ation storage medium and the enable 
signals and a controller unit, preferably a CPU and/or 

a video controller. This display controller is able to produce an 
overlay of the various stored video objects thereby offering 

the opportunity to switch the single objects partially on or 
off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display controller circuit for 
the generation of a video signal. To control a video display unit, for example the beam of a CRT, a 
video signal has to be provided this video signal 
representing the information to be displayed, for example the "pixel 
on/off" information or a color information. Such video 
signals are usually, for example in the case of a raster display, 
composed of video information, this video information being 
stored in an electronic memory such as a random acces memory (RAM). 
For each pixel of the display, this electronic memory 
contains a specific information. The information contained in this electronic memory is used to 
compose the video signal. For this purpose, the 
information contained in the memory in parallel form has to be 
processed to form a serial bit-stream. This is usually done by 
the use of shift registers which can be separate components or which 
can be integrated on the RAM chip. Address generation for these video RAMs (ramdom access memory to 
store the picture information) and generation of the 
additional video control signals (for example, the horizontal 
synchronization pulse, the vertical synchronization pulse or the 
blank signal) is usually performed by a video controller being 
preferably a special integrated circuit. Therefore, generation 
of the video signal is basically processed under control of the video 
controller. In some practical applications, it is necessary that various 
information generated separately is displayed on the screen 
in specific areas hereinafter called "windows". The complete display 
is composed of several "windows". For example, this is 
the case in some medical applications where various waveforms such as 
the electrocardiogram (ECG) or respiration, various 
trends such as heart rate, temperature or the like have to be 
displayed as well as some alphanumerics. All of this information 
is generated and updated separately. Of course, it is  
possible to build a complete view on the screen by storing 
said information in the video RAMs. Nevertheless, this 
method has several disadvantages: Any time a specific information has 
to be altered, the information previously stored in the 
related memory cells must be destroyed and therefore is no longer 
available for further operation. A very drastic example is a 
medical monitor showing, for example, the heart rate trend in one 
window. Whenever the user wants to replace the heart rate 
by, let us say, temperature, the heart rate information
