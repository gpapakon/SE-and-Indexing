<ABSTRACT>
Process for welding a weld-in part (3) in a weld point 
comprising a metal plate and a metal covering lying thereon 

with two tools of which one is formed by a welding head (11) and 
the other by a drill (12) for preparing the weld point by a 

drilling process. The drill (12) attached to a revolving device (7) 
initially in one operating position, by means of a lifting 

motor (4) which can be moved in a controlled manner between a 
return position and a machining end-position and vice versa, 

performs the process at least until the metal plate (17) is 
drilled (machining end-position) in preparation of the weld 

point. By pivoting of the revolving device (7), a welding head 
arranged on the revolving device (7) and equipped with the 

weld-in part (13) is then brought into an operating position 
above the prepared weld point to perform welding, meanwhile 

the drill (12) is coupled to the lifting motor (4) when the welding 
head (11) is coupled to the lifting motor (4) when the drill (12) is 

uncoupled to perform welding on completion of the drilling 
process. Drill (12) and the welding head (11) are each set aside in 

their return position on a rest shoulder after pivoting of 
the revolving device, the welding head (11) being equipped with a 

weld-in part (13) in the rest position and the revolving device (7) 
pivoting the drill or the welding head into the respective 

operating position from the rest position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for welding a 
weld-in part in a weld point with two tools of which one is 
formed by a welding head and the other by a drill for 
preparing the weld point by a drill process. The invention also relates to a device for 
carrying out this process in which the device for carrying 
out the process according to claim 1, in which two tools are 
arranged on a revolving device which is rotatable round a 
revolving device shaft and displaceable by a common lifting 
motor in the direction of the revolving device shaft, one 
tool consisting of a drill. It is known from DE-OS 27 55 694 to design a 
drilling and screwing machine for combining a drilling and 
screwing process such that a drill and a receiver for a 
screw-in part are arranged on a revolving device. To 
introduce the hole and to screw in the screw-in part there 
is used a common lifting motor which is disposed in a table 
acting as workpiece support and raises and lowers this table 
together with the workpiece lying thereon. The mass inertia 
of workpiece and table taken together should therefore be 
taken into consideration for the relative movement between 
tool and workpiece. The object of the invention is to automate the 
process for welding a weld-in part in a weld point 
comprising a metal plate and a metal covering lying thereon. 
The welding of a weld-in part forming the basis of the 
invention is disclosed in DE-OS 21 25 748. In order to weld 
the weld-in part, the metal covering is initially drilled 
through and the weld-in part then welded to the metal plate 
and the metal covering in a known manner by an arc welding 
process. It has been found that this method of joining two 
metal plates using a weld-in part is particularly 
advantageous for the welding of aluminium sheets. The object forming the basis of the invention, of 
automating the drilling and welding process, is achieved in  
 
that firstly the drill attached to a revolving device in one 
operating position performs the drilling process by means of 
a lifting motor, which is movable in a controlled manner 
between a return position and a machining end-position and 
vice versa, at least until the metal plate is drilled 
(machining end-position) and, thereafter, a welding head 
arranged on the revolving device and equipped with the 
weld-in part is brought, by pivoting of the revolving 
device, into an operating position above the prepared weld 
point to perform welding, meanwhile the drill is coupled to 
the lifting motor when the welding head is
