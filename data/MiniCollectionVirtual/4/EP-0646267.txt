<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a 
solenoid pilot light comprising a lamp connected to 
an inductance coil is mounted on a solenoid so that the 
inductance coil is inductively coupied with the solenoid coil 
whereby upon energizing the solenoid the lamp is inductively 
illuminated. Such an energization indicator is known from US-A-3 028 587. The known energization indicator can not easily be mounted, as its lamp coil has to be wound around the solenoid coil. According to the invention, as claimed in claim 1, the energization indicator may easily be screwed on to the solenoid plunger post. In a preferred embodiment, the 
unit may be 
used on the pilot valve solenoid in place of the solenoid 
retaining nut. In such embodiment the pilot light nay De otfered 
as an aftermarket item to replace retaining nuts on pilot valves 
in the field. FIG. 1 is a top view of the energization indicator; FIG. 2 is an exploded view of the energization 
indicator; FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken on the line 3-3 
of FIG. 1; FIG. 4 is a vertical cross-sectional view taken through 
the solenoid portion of a pilot valve assembly showing the 
energization indicator in place thereon; and FIG. 5 schematically illustrates the lines of flux 
created by energization of the pilot valve solenoid. As shown in FIG. 4, a typical pilot valve solenoid 
comprises a cylindrical plunger post 8 having a brass tube 
portion 10, the proximal end of which is enlarged with a boss-like 
flange 12 encircled by a groove 14 within which is disposed 
an O-ring 16 for sealing the boss and in turn the plunger post 
within the pilot valve, not shown. The solenoid plunger 18 is 
disposed within the bore 20 of the tube portion 10 for limited 
reciprocation and may be biased outwardly by a spring 22. The 
plunger is provided with elastomeric valve faces 24 and 26 at 
opposite ends, the former for sealing against an orifice (not 
shown) in the pilot valve, and the latter for sealing the orifice 
at 28 within the post. These valve faces may be provided by 
opposite ends of an elastomeric insert 30 disposed within a 
hollow bore 32 in the plunger 18. The plunger post 8 is provided with a stop portion 34 
received within the tubular portion 10 and secured by an 
indentation as at 36, which cooperates with a groove 38 in the 
stop. A fluid passageway 40 in the stop opens at its lower end 
through the orifice 28 and at its upper end through the distal 
end 42 of the post. The bore 40 may be enlarged as at 44 and 
threaded to receive a screw 46 which is axially bored

<CLAIMS>
Energization indicator for use with a 
solenoid having an encapsulated coil assembly containing a 

solenoid coil (53) for creating a flux field and an 
aperture extending axially through the coil and opening 

through opposite ends of the assembly for mounting on a 
solenoid plunger post (8) having a threaded end (66), 

comprising: 

an indicator lamp (70); 
a lamp coil (72) electrically connected to the 
lamp (70) for illuminating the same when a flux field 

sweeps the lamp coil; 
means (74) protectively enclosing the lamp 
coil (72) and providing support for the lamp (70); 
said means (74) defining an aperture (76) 
extending axially through the lamp coil (72) to allow 

telescoping engagement with said plunger post (8); 
means threadedly engaged with the threaded end 
(66) of the plunger post (8) for holding the lamp coil (72) 

and lamp (70) on the plunger post (8); and 
said means (74) protectively enclosing the 
lamp coil (72) being receivable over the plunger post (8) 

to bear against the coil assembly and hold the same on the 
post with the lamp coil disposed in a position to be swept 

by the flux field of the solenoid coil (53) whereby the 
lamp (70) is illuminated when the solenoid coil is 

energized. 
Energization indicator according to claim 
1, wherein said means (74) protectively enclosing the lamp 

coil (72) also protectively encloses the lamp, and is 
translucent adjacent the lamp (70). 
Energization indicator according to claim 
2, wherein said means (74) protectively enclosing the lamp 

coil (72) is opaque except for the translucent portion 
(128) adjacent the lamp (70). 
Energization indicator according to claim 
1, 2 or 3, wherein said means (74) protectively enclosing 

the lamp coil (72) is internally threaded for threaded 
engagement with the threaded end (66) of the plunger post 

(8).
