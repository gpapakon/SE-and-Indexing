<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an apparatus for tensioning 
of a fabric in a paper machine, such as a press felt 

(20), a drying wire (10), or of an equivalent fabric. 
The tensioning apparatus comprises a tensioning roll 

(30) fitted inside the loop of the fabric, the bearing 
supports (35a,35b) of said roll (30) being fixed, at 

the driving side and at the operating side of the 
machine, to sledges (40a,40b). These sledges (40a, 

40b) are arranged to be displaceable by means of a 
motor (37), synchronously in relation to one another, 

so as to tighten the fabric (10,20) that runs 
over the tensioning roll (30) to a certain tension (T). 

Said sledges (40a,40b) are fitted in connection with 
the frame part (24;130) of the machine on linear 

guides (42,44), which can be loaded in different 
directions transverse to the direction (B) of movement 

of the sledges (40a,40b). In view of displacing 
the sledges (40a,40b), shafts (51a,51b) operated by 

a motor (37) are journalled on the sledges, said 
shafts (51a,51b) being interconnected by means of a 

synchronization shaft (36) between the driving side 
(KP) and the operating side (HP).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an apparatus for tensioning of a fabric in a paper machine,
such as a press felt, a drying wire, or of an equivalent fabric,
and concerns particularly an apparatus according to the preamble
of claim 1, being based on DE-A-30 26 429.In a paper machine, various wires and fabrics are used, such as forming wires,
drying wires, and press felts, for all of which the general designation "fabric" will be
used in the following. The loops of these fabrics must be tensioned to a certain
tension T, which is, as a rule, set in the range of T ≈ 1...5 kN/m. Moreover, inside
said fabric loops, an alignment roll is used, by means of whose axial alignment the
transverse position of the fabric is controlled.In the prior art, a number of different devices for tensioning of the fabrics in a paper
machine are known. The solution that is used most commonly is probably a tensioning
device in which the tensioning roll is mounted at the operating side and at the
driving side of the machine on carriages, which are displaced synchronously with one
another on rollers inside a box beam attached to the frame part of the paper machine.
The prior-art fabric-tensioning devices have involved several drawbacks, which will
come out in more detail later. Thus, the principal object of the present invention is
to provide a novel apparatus for tensioning of fabrics, such as of a press felt or a
drying wire or equivalent, by whose means said drawbacks are eliminated. The prior
art with its drawbacks will be described in more detail later, reference being made to
Figs. A and B in the accompanying drawing. In view of achieving the objectives stated above and those that will come out later,
the invention has the features defined in the characterizing portion of claim 1.According to the invention, an apparatus for tensioning of a fabric in a paper
machine is provided that is of small size, low friction, and whose position can, thus,
be adjusted precisely without hysteresis. The invention also provides the advantage
that the suspension of the tensioning apparatus can be made almost free of play and,
thus, rigid and less susceptible of vibration. It is a further advantage that, when linear
guides in accordance with the invention are used, the sledges of the tensioning
apparatus can be supported in all directions transverse to their directions of movement,
for which reason the tensioning apparatus can be placed, without changes in
the construction, in any position whatsoever, even in a position hanging down on
support of its
