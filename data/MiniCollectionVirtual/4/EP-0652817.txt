<ABSTRACT>
A wood flour composition for making moulded wood products, such as boards and mouldings, contains a mixture of 99-75 % by weight of pulverulent wood particles and 1-25 % by weight of pulverulent phenolic resin. The pulverulent wood particles have such a particle size that the particles pass a sieve with a mesh size of  
<
/=  0.5 mm. A method for producing the wood flour composition and its use for making moulded boards or moulded wood products are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wood flour composition 
for making moulded wood products, such as boards 
and mouldings. The invention also concerns a method for 
producing the wood flour composition, as well as its use. 
More precisely, the invention bears upon a wood flour composition 
containing pulverulent wood particles and pulverulent 
phenolic resin. It is well-known to make boards and mouldings from 
glue-coated cellulose-containing products, such as wood 
chips and wood fibres. Further, it is common that the 
boards or objects made therefrom and the moulded details 
are surface-treated, e.g. by painting or laminating. Prior 
art particle boards and fibreboards suffer from the disadvantage 
that painting may give the surface a rough texture, 
especially with machined surfaces, e.g. subsequent 
to milling, because the surface-treatment has made the 
fibres or chips "stand on end". To obtain an acceptable 
surface, the rough surface has to be sanded, and the board 
painted anew. When the requirements are high, it may be 
necessary to sand and paint the board several times, which 
makes the surface treatment expensive. For certain complicated 
details, sanding may, in addition, be so difficult 
that the production of such details becomes unprofitable. 
This for example applies to complicated patterns milled or 
otherwise formed in the surface of the board. In most 
cases, such three-dimensional patterns have to be sanded 
by hand. Another drawback of prior art board materials is 
their sensitivity to moisture. Thus, the boards swell when 
taking up moisture. Already a minor damage to the covering 
layer of paint or plastic causes ingress of moisture, so 
that the board swells and the surface layer cracks. When 
the boards are to be used in a moist environment, it may 
therefore be necessary to surface-treat the material by a 
costly laminating operation involving durable and often 
fibre-reinforced plastic layers. It has now surprisingly been found that the present  
 
invention gives moulded wood products that have none of the 
above drawbacks. As recited in the appended claims, the invention comprises 
a wood flour composition containing a mixture of 
pulverulent wood and pulverulent phenolic resin. The 
invention further concerns a method for producing the wood 
flour composition, as well as its use. Products made from the wood flour composition according 
to the invention obtain a surface which is easier to 
treat, the wood flour making it much easier to treat the 
surface of the finished
