<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle roof with a glass panel (1') which is surrounded by a two-part panel frame (4') and the glass pane (2) of which is coated on its lower face with a thin, lattice-like sun visor (8') preferably applied by screen-printing. Bearing from below against the sun visor (8') is a multi-layered closing plate (10') which is guided displaceably on the lateral longitudinal parts of the panel frame (4') and the thin closing-plate layers (24, 25, 26) of which have a corresponding, lattice-like structure. The closing-plate layers can be displaced on top of one another and can be displaced or set successively for the continuous covering or release of the large openings (9') for light in the sun visor (8'). A driving device (17) provides an appropriate drive for the displacement of the individual closing-plate layers (24, 25, 26).

Vehicle roof comprising a glass lid (1'), which completely 
fills a roof opening in a closed position, is adjustable for 

at least partly exposing the opening and is provided with a 
sunshield (8') formed as an opaque coating of the lower face 

of the glass lid (1'), which sunshield possesses a series of 
uniformly spaced light apertures (9') and with which is 

associated a closure plate (10') constructed as a slider and 
bearing directly against it, which closure plate is slidably 

guided on a lid frame (4') parallel to the sunshield (8') and 
is equipped with closure portions (12') for optionally 

completely or partly closing or opening the light apertures 
(9') and openings (11') alternating therewith, which openings 

can be optionally completely or partly aligned with the 
corresponding light apertures (9') of the sunshield (8') by 

displacing the closure plate (10'), whereby the width of the 
openings (11') corresponds with the width of the light 

apertures (9') and the width of the closure portions (12') 
corresponds with the distance between the light apertures 

(9'), characterized in that the width of the light apertures 
(9') of the sunshield (8') is equal to a multiple of the width 

of the closure portions (12') of the closure plate (10'), and 
that the closure plate (10') consists of a number, 

corresponding to the aforementioned multiple, of individual, 
thin closure plate layers (24, 25, 26), which bear against one 

another without intermediate spaces and are displaceable 
relative to one another. 
Vehicle roof according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the lid frame (4') is constructed in two parts, comprising an 

upper frame part (22), enclosing and holding the glass pane 
(2) of the glass lid (1'), and a lower frame part (23) which 

can be firmly connected thereto, which lower frame part 
possesses a plane seating surface (27) for the multilayer 

closure plate (10'), which seating surface extends parallel to  
 

and at a distance from the lower face of the glass pane (2) 
respectively of the sunshield (8'), whereby this distance 

being approximately equal to the total thickness of the 
multilayer closure plate (10'). 
Vehicle roof according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that, in the closure or opening of the light passages (9') of 

the sunshield (8'), the closure plate layers (24, 25, 26) are 
slidable one after another in such a way that initially one of 

the two outer closure plate layers (24, 26) is slidable, after 
a sliding distance of approximately the width of the closure 

portions (12') the adjacent closure plate layer (25) is 
entrained, and any further closure plate payers are each 

entrained in their layer sequence by corresponding 
displacement distances, until for the last displacement 

distance of approximately the width of the closure portions 
(12'), the other of the two outer closure plate layers is also 

entrained. 
Vehicle roof according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that, on the forward transverse component (28) of the lower 

lid frame part (23), a drive apparatus (17) for the 
displacement of the closure plate layers (24, 25, 26) in the 

longitudinal direction of the vehicle is mounted, this 
apparatus consisting of a circular drive disc (20), mounted 

rotatably but axially fixed in a housing (18') and provided 
with a downwardly pointing handle (19), which disc possesses, 

on its upper face, an eccentrically mounted, upwardly 
projecting entrainer pin (21), which slidably engages into 

slits (32, 33, 34) formed transversely to the vehicle 
longitudinal direction in each of the closure plate layers 

(24, 25, 26), the width of which slits varies, in the 
individual closure plate layers (24, 25, 26), according to the 

entrainer engagement that occurs successively from one closure 
plate layer to the next, and increases by steps from one of 

the two outer closure plate layers to the other.  
 
Vehicle roof according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the light apertures (9') in the 

sunshield (8') are fully exposed by the closure portions (12') 
of the closure plate layers (24, 25, 26) when all the closure 

plate layers (24, 25, 26) have been displaced fully home 
against the forward transverse component (29) of the upper 

frame part (22), but are fully closed when all the closure 
plate layers (24, 25, 26) have been displaced fully home into 

a seating groove (31) of the rear transverse component (30) of 
the upper frame part (22).
