<ABSTRACT>
A surface illuminant is provided to obtain brighter illumination. The surface illuminant comprises a transparent 
body, a source of light on one side of the transparent body, a diffusing plate on its emitting side, and a prism sheet 

on the other side of the transparent body. The prism sheet has numerous prism-like projections on the opposite side 
of the tranparent body. Each projection of the prism sheet has a gentle slope in the direction of the source of light 

and a less gentle one in the opposite direction so that illuminating light can be directed to the given parts of a liquid 
crystal display device, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface light source
device for use in a back light system of a liquid crystal display
apparatus.Fig. 6 shows a construction of a liquid crystal display
apparatus in which a conventional surface light source device
using a light conducting member is used as its back light system.
In Fig. 6, the numerical reference 1 represents a plate-like
light conducting member, which is made of a transparent material,
2 a linear light source disposed in the vicinity of a light emitting
edge surface 1a of said light conducting member 1, 3 a light
diffusing plate disposed on a front surface 1b of said light
conducting member 1 and the numerical reference 4 represents a
light reflecting member arranged on a rear surface 1c of said
light conducting member, constituting of the surface light source
device. Further, the numerical reference 5 represents a liquid
crystal display apparatus.In the surface light source device, a light emitted from
the light source 2 is made incident upon the light emitting
surface 1a of the light conducting member 1 and then the light is
introduced inside thereof. During when the light is transmitted
to an opposite edge surface 1d of the light conducting member,
the light is emitted from the front surface (light emitting
surface) 1b of the light conducting member and then passes
through the light diffusing plate 3 to become a diffused light. 
The liquid crystal display apparatus 5 is illuminated by the
diffused light coming from the light diffusing plate 3.The illuminating light generated from the surface light
source device is diffused in all directions by the light diffusing
plate 3, but the most of them is directed to a direction
shown by arrows in Fig. 6. Therefore, there exists some light
which is not made incident upon the liquid crystal display apparatus,
and thus enough brightness cannot be obtained on the apparatus.
Further, out of the light being made incident upon the
liquid crystal display apparatus, only a few light is directed to
a direction substantially perpendicular to the liquid crystal
display apparatus, because of the existence of the light diffusion
plate 3. Therefore, there is a drawback that the image
surface of the liquid crystal display apparatus is dark for an
operator who observes the image surface in front of the liquid
crystal display apparatus. In order to overcome this drawback, document EP-A-531939 discloses a
surface light source device according to the preamble part of claim 1. A prism
sheet 10 is disposed between the light
