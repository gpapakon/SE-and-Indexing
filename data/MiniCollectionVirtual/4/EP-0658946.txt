<ABSTRACT>
The electrode plate (12) includes an active part (E) pasted with active material and a plate head (2, 3, 11) including a connection stem (3). The plate head is constituted by the actual metal foam of the plate support, and its density, per unit surface area of metal foam, is at least 2.5 times that of the metal foam of the rest of the electrode plate, the higher density of the plate head resulting from an operation of compressing the foam of the support, the stem (3) of the plate head emerging from the middle of the thickness (e2) of the plate and resulting from compression of the support in two directions: a first compression in its height direction and a second compression in its thickness direction. Such an electrode plate is manufactured from a metal foam plate whose upper edge is compressed so as to form the plate head. The compression takes place in the height direction and subsequently in the thickness direction at the stem (3) and at least in the height direction over the rest of the length of the electrode.

<CLAIMS>
An electrode plate (12) for an electrochemical cell and having a 
metal foam type support (1), the plate comprising an active portion 

(E) pasted with active material and a plate head (2, 3, 11) that 
includes a connection tab (3), the plate being characterized in that 

said plate head is constituted by the same metal foam as said 
support, without adding any additional parts or additional strips of 

metal foam, the density per unit area of the metal foam in said plate 
head being at least 2.5 times its density in the remainder of the 

electrode, the greater density of the plate head coming from an 
operation in which the foam of the support is compressed, said tab 

(3) and said plate emerging from the middle of the thickness (e
2
) of 
said plate and being the result of compressing said support in two 

directions: a first compression in the plane of the electrode and in 
the height direction thereof; and a second compression perpendicular 

to the plane of the electrode and in the thickness direction thereof. 
An electrode plate according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
portion (2) of the plate head that lies outside said connection tab 

(3) has porosity that is as close as possible to 0% as achieved by 
maximum crushing of the initial foam of the support (1) in the height 

direction of the electrode. 
An electrode plate according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the free top end of said connection tab (3) includes a portion 

(13) of thickness greater than the remainder of said tab. 
A method of making an electrode plate according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized by the fact that starting from a plate 

of said support of length L, of height H, and of thickness e
1
, the 
following steps are performed: 


a - said support is filled with active material from the bottom 
up to a height of H-G; 
b - the non-filled portion, constituting a strip initially of 
height G is compressed in the height direction, i.e. in the plane of 

the support; and  
 
c - the entire support is compressed in the direction of its 
thickness e
1
, said compression being incomplete in the portion 
thereof that is filled with active material so as to give rise to a 

thickness e
2
, and being maximal in at least the major portion of the 
remaining height of said strip, running from the filled portion, 

while nevertheless leaving a transitional portion (11) between said 
incompletely compressed filled portion (E), and said maximal 

compression of at least the major fraction of the remaining height of 
said strip. 
A method of making an electrode plate according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized by the fact that starting from a plate 

of said support of length L, of height H, and of thickness e
1
, the 
following steps are performed: 


a - a strip of said support of initial height G is compressed 
in the height direction, i.e. in the plane of the support; 
b - at least the major fraction of the remaining height of said 
strip as compressed in above operation 
a
 is maximally compressed in 
its thickness direction, running from the non-compressed portion and 

leaving a transitional portion (11) between said non-compressed 
portion and said maximal compression of the major fraction of the 

height of said strip; 
c - the entire non-compressed portion of said support together 
with said transitional portion thereof is filled with active 

material; and 
d - the entire portion of the support that is filled with 
active material in operation 
c
 is compressed in part. 
A method according to claim 4 or 5, characterized by the fact that 
said compression in the height direction of said strip of initial 

height G (the operation performed in step 4b or 5a) is maximal over a 
fraction 
x
 of the length L of the support and partial over the 
remaining portion forming a tab (3) constituting said connection tab. 
A method according to claim 4 or 5, characterized by the fact that 
said compression in the height direction of said strip of initial  

 
height G (operation performed in step 4b or 5a) is uniform partial 

compression (Figure 4A) over the entire length L of the support. 
A method according to claim 7, characterized by the fact that a 
fraction (23) of said portion that has not been filled with active 

material is cut off so as to leave only a tongue that constitutes 
said connection tab (3). 
A method according to any one of claims 4 to 8, characterized by 
the fact that said maximal compression in the thickness direction of 

the initial support (operation performed in step 4c or 5b) is 
performed from both sides of said support (1). 
A method according to any one of claims 4 to 9, characterized by 
the fact that said operation of compressing at least a major portion 

of said strip to a maximal extent in the thickness direction leaves 
an incompletely compressed small fraction of the height of said strip
