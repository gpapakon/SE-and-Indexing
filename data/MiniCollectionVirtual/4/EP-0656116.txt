<ABSTRACT>
A means for determining the effectiveness of interferon therapy in individuals who are infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and are receiving such therapy. Monitoring the level of anti-HCV IgM and/or anti-GOR IgG provide means for establishing whether or not the infected patient is responding to interferon therapy; such monitoring is especially useful for patients diagnosed with chronic acute HCV infections.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERFERON THERAPY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH HCV INFECTIONSBackground of the InventionThis invention relates generally to interferon therapy, and more particularly, relates to the monitoring of anti-HCV IgM or anti-GOR IgG in an individual's test sample as an indication of the clinical effectiveness and/or clinical outcome of interferon therapy used to treat an individual with chronic HCV infection.Greater than 90% of cases of transfusion hepatitis worldwide are attributed to non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). The predominant etiological agent of NANBH, termed Hepatitis C virus (HCV), has been cloned. An immunodominant region designated as c-100, encoded by the putative nonstructural (NS)-4 genomic region, has been expressed, purified, and incorporated into immunoassays which are useful in the detection of antibody to HCV in infected test samples. See, for example, Q.-L. Choo et al., Science 244:359-362 (1989); H. J. Alter et al., N. Enpl. J. Med. 321:1494-1500 (1989); J. I. Esteban et al., Lancet ii:294-297 (1989); G. Huo et al., Science 244:362-364 (1989); T. Miyamura et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:983-987 (1990); and C. L. Van der Poel et al., Lancet Ï‹:297-298 (1989).Recently, Mishiro et al. have reported isolation of a cDNA clone designated as GOR4701, from the plasma of a chimpanzee experimentally infeted with NANBH agent. S. Mishiro et al., Lancet 336:1400-1403 (1990). the GOR-47-1 cDNA clone was shown to lack detectable sequence homology to known HCV sequences. Further, unlike HCV, GOR gene is coded by a single-copy gene of host cellular sequence. An EIA has been developed using a 27-amino acid synthetic peptide, spGOR2, deduced from the cDNA sequence of the GOR gene. Using this EIA. 60% to 80% if the samples were found to be reactive, while only two percent (2%) of the voluntary donor population had anti- GOR2 antibodies, suggesting a strong association between immune response to GOR and HCV in NANBH patients. 

 It is known that a percentage of individuals who develop NANBH (HCV) infections progress to the chronic state of the disease, where liver function is impaired and death ultimately may result in severe cases. Interferon therapy has been shown to improve liver function in a proportion of patients with NANB hepatitis. About fifty percent (50%) of chronic Hepatitis C cases respond to alpha interferon (IFN) therapy. No demographic, biochemical or clinical features have been identified to predict response to therapy.

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An method for determining the effectiveness of interferon therapy in an individual infected with HCV, comprising:
(a) determining the pre-interferon amount of anti-HCV IgM or anti-GOR IgG in a test sample of a patient infected with HCV;
(b) determining the amount of anti-HCV IgM and/or anti- GOR IgG in an individual during inteferon therapy by assaying for anti-HCV IgM or anti-GOR IgG in at least one other test sample;
(c) comparing the pre-interferon amount of anti-HCV IgM or anti-GOR IgG with the amount of anti-HCV IgM or anti-GOR IgG present in a different test sample obtained from the individual during interferon therapy; wherein a decrease in anti-GOR IgG and/or anti-HCV IgM indicates complete response in said individual.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the GOR antigen is selected from the group consisting of GOR2 and GOR346.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the HCV antigen is selected from the group consisting of HCV-core, HCV-33c and HCV-c- 100.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein said HCV antigen is HCV- core.
