<ABSTRACT>
Unit for soilless plant culture of the type comprising mobile modules which are suspended vertically so as to form lines of modules (1, 1A) which receive the plants (4) and are fed with a nutritive solution. Each of said modules (1) comprises a container (2) of cylindrical shape, the diameter of which is approximately between 5 and 50 cm and the height "h1" of which is approximately between 20 cm and 300 cm, and a culture means contained in the container (2). The modules (1) are driven on the one hand with a rotary movement about their vertical axis (10) and on the other hand with a translation movement which makes it possible to displace the modules horizontally. The series of lines of parallel modules (1) constitute zones (A, B), which are separated from one another by an intervening area (C), with means (25) for lateral transfer in a direction from the end of one zone (A) to the adjacent zone (B), in which the modules (1) are displaced in the reverse direction, after passage through said intervening area (C) which is insulated in relation to the translation zones (A, B).

An installation for off-soil cultivation of plants, comprising mobile modules, 
hung vertically, in order to form lines of modules (1, 1A), which accommodate the 

plants (4) and which are supplied by a nutritive solution (5), characterised in that 
each of the said modules (1, 1A) comprises : 


a container (2, 2A) cylindrical in shape whose diameter ranges between 
approx. 5 and 50 cm and whose height "h1" ranges between approx. 20 cm and 300 

cm, 
a means of cultivation enclosed in the said container (2, 2A), in that the 
modules (1, 1A) are animated, on the one hand, by a rotational motion around their 

vertical axis (10) to cause adequate distribution of light for each plant (4) of a given 
module (1, 1A), whereas the rotation rhythm is suited to the homogenisation needs of 

light and to the photoperiodic requirements of the species cultivated and, on the other 

hand, a translation motion (F1, F2) enabling to move the modules (1, 1A) 
horizontally, and in that the series of parallel module lines (1, 1A) constitute zones 

(A, B) separated by an intervention area ( C), with means (25) for transferring in one 
direction (F3) from the end of a zone (A), to the neighbouring zone (B) in which the 

modules (1) move in reverse direction, after passing through the said intervention 
area ( C), which is isolated with respect to the translation zones (A, B). 
An installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the cultivation 
means is made up of a substrate (3) consisting of fibres whose natural mellowness 

offers an air volume ranging between 30 and 35 %, whereby the said fibres are 
compacted to obtain a density above 50 kg/m3, preferably ranging between 100 

kg/m3 and 300 kg/m3.  
 
An installation according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the container 
(2) is a retaining element for the substrate (3), constituted of an inextensible and 

drillable material, which does not tear when plants (4) are pricked in the substrate 
(3). 
An installation according to claim 3, characterised in that the material 
constituting the retaining element (2) is a plastic material, of thickness ranging 

between 90 µm and 100 µm, opaque and white in colour. 
An installation according to any of the claims 3 or 4, characterised in that the 
stiffness of the retaining element (2) is increased by the internal and/or external use 

of a small mesh net, for instance out of polyethylene or polypropylene. 
An installation according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
plants (4) are pricked in each module (1) following a spiral or helix (4) pattern. 
An installation according to any of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
substrate (3) exhibits properties such that in combination with the sizes of the 

container, they enable satisfactory percolation of the nutritive solution (5) for its 
regular and homogeneous enrichment over its whole height (h1), notably in mineral 

salts. 
An installation according to any of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the 
substrate (3) exhibits the following properties : 


low exchange capacity 
sterility 
fibrous texture 
lightness, its weight not exceeding approx. 15 kg when saturated with nutritive 
solution (5) 
draining 
hydrophilic 
compacted 
recyclable. 
An installation according to one of the claims 7 or 8, characterised in that the 
substrate (3) is obtained from elements such as :  

 

natural elements, for instance peat, puzzolana, bark, sawdust, fibre or wood chip, 
vegetal or animal fibre, 
artificial elements, for instance : glass fibre, silicate fibre, fibres from molten rock, 
perlite, expanded clay, 
or mixtures of said natural and artificial elements. 
An installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the cultivation 
means (3A) of the module (1A) consists of a nutritive solution; whereas the said 

solution may contain, additionally, a microflora antagonistic of the morbific microorganisms 
of the plants cultivated and fostering the growth of the plants, whereas the 

said solution can be placed in contact in liquid condition with the substrate according 
to the hydroponic technology or directly with the plants in the form of saturated

container (3A) consists of a stiff and impervious envelope. 
An installation according to claims 10 and 11, characterised in that nozzles
