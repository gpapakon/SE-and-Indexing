<ABSTRACT>
A printer has a collective mode for searching a 
print control program adapted to the processing of print 

data from a number of print control programs stored in a 
printer and a combination mode for searching an adapted 

print control program from combinations of predetermined 
print control programs. The modes are selected by a key 

of a switch panel. From the print data, the control code 
for determining the print control command system is 

analyzed, and a print control program adapted to the 
analyzed control code is searched from the print control 

programs of each mode. This system enables the accurate 
determination of a print control program adapted to a 

print data processing a number of print control programs 
having different command systems for print control.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printer with a number
of print control programs having different command systems
and, particularly, to a printer in which a selection range
for the print programs adapted to print processing is set
to all of the print control programs, yet can be limited
to a part of the print control programs.In companies, personal computers or work stations
have been recently introduced in association with the
development of office automation. At the same time, these
computers are connected to high-speed printers, such as
laser printers, dot printers or the like, through the same
cable used to configure a network system in which desired
print data stored in the computers are transmitted to
enable print processing using a desired printer.For each printer, a number of print control
programs having different command systems for print
control are installed into a control device of the printer.
On the basis of transmitted print data, a print
control program adapted to the print processing can be
selectively and manually set from the print control
programs using an operation panel or automatically set by
an automatic selection mode.When the automatic selection mode is set, all of
the print control programs installed into the control
device are set as a selection target. A print control
program having a control code coincident with a print
control code contained the print data is finally determined
as a print control program adapted to the print
processing. So, the print data is subjected to the print
processing using the suitable print control program thus
determined.EP-A-0452115, on which the precharacterising portions of
appended claims 1, 5 and 8 are based, discloses a printer similar
to discussed above which also stores control programs on an
additional memory such as a program cartridge. In general, a large number of print control programs, such
as a print control program of a command system that is optimally
designed for document data, a print control program of a command
system for a plotter used in a CAD field, and a print control
program of a command system used for a print operation of a
complicated image (picture), are practically used as the print
control program. Some of these print control programs are very
similar to one another in the kind of print data and its field.As described above, in the automatic selection
mode for automatically selecting the print control program,
all of the print control programs installed into the
control device are set as the selection target.

<CLAIMS>
A printer comprising:

a first memory (27) for storing a plurality of print
control programs each having a different command system with a

corresponding control code;
a second memory (28) for storing input print data including
a command system;
a determiner for comparing command systems of the first
memory (27) to the input command system in the second memory (28)

to determine a matching command system; and
a printing mechanism (35) for printing the input print data
based on the control system with the matching command system;

characterised by
a command system combiner (26) for combining control
programs with dissimilar command systems from the first memory

(27) into groups, wherein the determiner (26) compares the
command systems of the control programs combined in one of said

groups with the input command system in the second memory (28).
The printer of claim 1 further comprising a mode setter
(12) for selectively setting an automatic mode for selecting a

control program with a command system from the first memory (27)
that corresponds to the input command system in the second memory

The printer of claim 1 or 2 further comprising an alarm
(10) for warning when no matching command system is determined.
The printer of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the command
system combiner is adapted to combine the control programs in a

first combination mode including a group of some of the control
programs, a second combination mode including a group of other
