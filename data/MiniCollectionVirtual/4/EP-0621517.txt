<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning apparatus including a rotary cleaning brush having a flicker bar (120) for 
removing particles from the cleaning brush. The flicker bar is a unitary member having an air 

channel (115) integral therein, along which a flow of air is established for carrying away 
removed particles. The unitary construction and support bars (200) in the top member of the 

flicker bar provide a uniform air channel width that is not compromised due to assembly 
tolerances.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an electrostatographic printer or copier, and more
particularly concerns a cleaning apparatus used therein.In an electrophotographic application such as xerography, a charge retentive surface
(i.e. photoconductor, photoreceptor or imaging surface) is electrostatically charged, and
exposed to a light pattern of an original image to be reproduced to selectively discharge the
surface in accordance therewith. The resulting pattern of charged and discharged areas on
that surface form an electrostatic charge pattern (an electrostatic latent image) conforming to
the original image. The latent image is developed by contacting it with a finely divided
electrostatically attractable powder referred to as "toner". Toner is held on the image areas by
the electrostatic charge on the surface. Thus, a toner image is produced in conformity with a
light image of the original being produced. The toner image may then be transferred to a
substrate (e.g., paper), and the image affixed thereto to form a permanent record of the image
to be reproduced. Subsequent to development, excess toner left on the charge retentive
surface is cleaned from the surface. The process is well known, and useful for light lens copying
from an original, and printing applications from electronically generated or stored originals,
where a charge surface may be imagewise discharged in a variety of ways. Ion projection
devices where a charge is imagewise deposited on a charge retentive substrate operate
similarly.Although a preponderance of the toner forming the image is transferred to the
paper during transfer, some toner invariably remains on the charge retentive surface, it being
held thereto by relatively high electrostatic and/or mechanical forces. Additionally, paper
fibers, Kaolin and other debris have a tendency to be attracted to the charge retentive surface.
It is essential for optimum operation that the toner remaining on the surface be cleaned
thoroughly therefrom.A commercially successful mode of cleaning employed on automatic xerographic
devices utilizes a rotatable brush that frictionally engages the imaging surface to remove the
residual toner and paper particles therefrom.In brush cleaners such as those in a xerographic cleaner where a rotating brush is
used to clean (via mechanical, electrostatic, or other means) toner (or other particles such as
carrier beads, paper fibers, etc.) from the photoreceptor (or any other surface for that matter),
detoning (or cleaning) the brush is necessary. Air

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (92) for removing particles from a surface (10), the apparatus
comprising:


a housing (145);
a rotatably mounted brush (100), at least partially enclosed in said housing (145) and
contacting the surface (10) to remove particles therefrom; and
a bar (120) in contact with said brush (100) for removing particles therefrom, said bar
defining a channel (115) therein adapted to have air with removed particles flow therethrough,

   characterised in that said bar (120) is mounted slidably into said housing (145) and in that
said bar (120) is of unitary construction.
Apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein the channel (115) of said bar is
substantially uniform in width therealong.
Apparatus as recited in claim 2, wherein said bar (120) comprises:

first and second members (175) arranged substantially parallel to one another and each
having an inner surface and an outer surface opposed from one another, said inner surface of said

first member and said inner surface of said second member being opposed from one another; and
a top member (177) arranged substantially perpendicular to and interposed between said
first and second members (175) and connecting said first member to said second member to define

the channel (115) between said first and second members (175) and said top member (177).
Apparatus as recited in claim 3, wherein said top member (177) defines a slot (210)
connected to the channel (115) to allow air and particles to pass therethrough from said brush (100).
Apparatus as recited in any one of claims 1 to 4, further comprising means (150),
coupled to said channel (115), for generating a flow of air therethrough.
Apparatus as recited in claim 5 when dependent on claim 4, wherein said
generating means (150) is connected to the slot (210) in said top member (177) to enable air and

particles from said brush (100) to pass through the slot (210) into said generating means (150).
Apparatus as recited in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said bar (120)
comprises a 
handle (121) at one end thereof enabling said bar (120) to be inserted into and
removed from said housing (145). 
Apparatus as recited in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the apparatus
includes two rotatably mounted brushes (100) in the housing (145), the two brushes (100) being

separated by a separator (130) and each having an associated bar (120).
