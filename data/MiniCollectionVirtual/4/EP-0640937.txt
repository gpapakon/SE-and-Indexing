A plurality of arcuate grouping contacts and a plurality of 
strip contacts are formed in an annular array in opposed 

spaced relation with each other on two insulation layers. 
A control key is disposed in opposed position to the annular 

array of contacts on the side on one of the insulation layers 
opposite from the other of the layers and an annular elastic 

member is interposed between the undersurface of the control 
key and the annular array of contacts whereby a portion of 

one of the insulation layers is displaced toward the other of 
the insulation layers depending upon the direction and 

magnitude of a force applied to the control key to bring the 
grouping contacts corresponding to the direction of the force 

into contact with one or more of the strip contacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an input control device for 
inputting signals for controlling the direction and speed 
of movement of a cursor on a display screen such as a mouse 
serving as an input control device for a computer. Generally, mouses or joy sticks are frequently employed 
as an input control device for a computer. The use of a 
mouse or joy stick may enhance the operability of a 
computer in that it permits angle signals for two 
directions of X and Y axes to be concurrently generated, 
thereby ensuring smooth movements of a cursor. The mouse generally comprises a single spherical 
control member and two rotary encoders for detecting the 
rotation in X and Y directions, the encoders being in 
operative engagement with the control member to move the 
latter in desired directions to thereby generate angle 
signals for X and Y directions. The joy stick comprises a control lever supported 
vertically by a console and is configured to generate 
angle signals (direction signals) as the lever is tilted in a desired direction 
to bring the contact located in that direction into contact 
with the corresponding one. The mouse is capable of producing angle component signals having 
a high resolution since such signals are generated by 
rotary encoders. It is also able to produce velocity 
signals depending on the speed at the spherical control 
member is moved in rolling motions, whereby the speed of 
movement of a cursor appearing on a monitor may be varied. 
While the mouse is superior as an input device in these  
 
respects, the drawback thereof is the complicated and 
expensive implementation. On the other hand, the joy stick has the disadvantage 
that it has a coarse resolution for the angular direction 
because no more than about 4 to 8 contacts are disposed 
around the control lever. An additional drawback is the 
inability to generate any signals corresponding to the 
operating speed other than angle signals. If velocity 
signals are to be generated corresponding to a force with 
which the lever is operated, it would be required to use 
expensive components such as pressure-sensitive rubber 
members and strain sensors, resulting in an increase in the 
cost of manufacture. In addition, with the arrangement in 
which the operating force is sensed by pressure-sensitive 
rubber members or strain sensors to produce velocity 
signals, the sensed signals will be output as analog 
signals. However, such analog signals must be passed 
through an A/D converter before they can be input to a 
computer,
