<ABSTRACT>
A table-leg (1, 2, 3, 4) for caravans is described, in particular as a support for a tabletop (5) fixed on one side. In order to avoid injuries to a person sitting at the table caused by hitting the tabletop in the event of a crash, the table-leg has a shock-absorbing behaviour under shock load directed substantially perpendicularly to the tabletop. Besides designs having frictionally interconnected or telescoping components, there is described a table-leg formed from tubular profiles, the ends of which are interconnected to form a single endless line.
