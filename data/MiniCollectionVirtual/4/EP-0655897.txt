<ABSTRACT>
A substructure (19) for a dental inlay, crown, bridge or the like having a roughened surface suitable for bonding to a surface of a support structure is formed by a method comprising bonding granules (20) to a moulding surface (22) of a dental investment model (23) of the appropriate part of the mouth. A mouldable material is applied to the moulding surface (22) so as to cover the granules (20), and the material is then allowed to at least partially set. Finally the material is removed from the moulding surface and the granules are removed from the material so as to leave a substructure having a roughened surface of the required form for bonding to the support structure surface. This technique is particularly applicable to production of roughened surfaces on substructures which cannot be easily etched. One such substructure is a glass-infiltrated alumina substructure such as In-Ceram.

<DESCRIPTION>
"Improvements in or relating to Substructures for Bonding to Support Structures" This invention relates to the production of substructures having roughened surfaces suitable for bonding to support structures, to substructures so formed and to kits for forming such substructures.In the dental field it is known to use glass- infiltrated alumina substrates, such as In-Ceram (Registered Trade Mark) substrates, to form substructures for dental crowns of exceptionally high strength. Such substructures are generally coated with porcelain to provide both biocompatibility and aesthetic matching with existing teeth. The completed crown may be cemented in position within the patient's mouth. However it is important that the crown is cemented in position as securely as possible as it is subject to high loads within the mouth and many dental problems are caused by dislodgement of such crowns. Whilst such bonding is considerably improved if the surface of the substructure to be bonded is roughened prior to cementing, it is difficult to produce such a roughened surface by conventional techniques, such as acid etching, in view of the hardness of the material from which the substructure is formed. For the same reason it has proved difficult to produce dental inlays or crowns in this manner.It is an object of the invention to provide a novel technique capable of applying to such substructures a roughened surface suitable for bonding to the required 

support structure.According to the present invention there is provided a method of producing a substructure having a roughened surface suitable for bonding to a surface of a support structure, which method comprises bonding granules to a moulding surface constituted by or corresponding to the support structure surface, applying mouldable material to the moulding surface so as to cover the granules and allowing the material to at least partially set, and removing both the material from the moulding surface and the granules from the material so as to leave a substructure having a roughened surface of the required form for bonding to the support structure surface.This technique is particularly applicable to production of roughened surfaces on substructures which cannot be easily etched. One such substructure is a glass-infiltrated alumina substructure such as In-Ceram.The moulding surface will generally be a model of the support surface to which the substructure is to be bonded, although it may in certain circumstances be the support surface itself. The model is preferably an
