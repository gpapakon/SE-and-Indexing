<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of a glass sheet (pane) which has been provided with a heat-resistant layer system and has high transmission in the visible spectral region and high reflection for heat radiation. The layer system, applied by a vacuum process, comprises an adhesive layer of a metal oxide, a metal layer arranged on the adhesive layer, a silver layer, a metal layer arranged on the silver layer, and a top layer of a metal oxide arranged on the metal layer. Before application of this layer system, a primer layer of an oxide, nitride, oxynitride, carbide or boride of one or more of the elements Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Zn, Al, As, Sb, In and Si is, according to the invention, deposited directly on the glass surface. Glass sheets provided with such a layer structure can be warmed to a temperature of about 650 degrees celsius and subjected to subsequent flexing and/or prestressing without damage to the layer.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of a glass plate provided 
with a composite layer having a high transmission factor in 

the visible spectral range and a high reflection factor for 
thermal radiation, in the case of which using a vacuum method 

a layer sequence is applied to the glass plate, such layer 
sequence comprising a lower anti-reflection layer comprising 

a basic layer arranged on the glass surface and being made up 
of a metal compound, and a metal oxide layer following same 

a metal layer arranged on the lower anti-reflection layer, a 
silver layer and an upper anti-reflection layer,
 
characterized in that the basic layer arranged directly on 

the glass surface is formed by an oxide, nitride, oxynitride, 
carbide or boride of one of more of the elements Hf, V, Nb, 

Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Zn, As, Sb and In, or by mixed compounds 
thereof, or by one of the compounds Si
