<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vacuum tube amplifier emulation, and to non-linear
semiconductor amplifiers.Tube amplifier emulation does model the tube amplifier in such detailed
terms as plate resistance and effects of the screen grid. The plate resistance of
a triode is particularly unique since all semiconductors have extensive regions of
current limits.Accurate modeling of the plate resistance is needed when tubes drive non-resistive
or non-linear loads. A popular analysis of vacuum tube distortion
components lumps the variable gain with the variable output impedance and
represent it as a resistive load. This analysis does not hold with reactive or non-linear
loads and there are no closed form solutions which would lead to a model.The present application deals with behavior of vacuum tube in a more
detailed manner. The attention to the voltage and current characteristics
emulates the subtleties of reactive loads and their interaction with vacuum tubes
this is either missing or in a different form in the background art. Applicant's
prior works PCT/US88/01025 uses a series connection of an amplifier and a non-linear
means for the transfer characteristics of a pentode and not the output
characteristic of a pentode. Sondermeyer (GB 2149954 A or US 4,405,832) uses
a dual potentiometer to control the gain and frequency response while adjusting
the mix of clean and distorted signals in an output. Tiers et al. (US 5,032,796)
creates a voltage transfer characteristic that changes harmonic structure with time.
Christian (US 4,899, 115) uses anti-parallel diodes to create a non-linear
attenuator which he denotes as a compressor.The object of this invention is a semiconductor emulation for emulating a
vacuum tube with one or more of the following characteristics: non-linear output,
non-linear transfer, non-linear input, reverse transfer, and second harmonic
generation.This object is used by a semiconductor vacuum tube emulation
device according to claim 1 or 4. Preferred embodiments are
disclosed in the depending claims. Other advantages and features of the present invention will
become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when
considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.Figures 1 and 2 are schematics of non-linear resistor-diode networks. Figure 3 is a schematic of a non-linear semiconductor
network.Figure 4 is a symbol for a non-linear network.Figure 5 is a schematic of a triode emulation circuit.Figure 6 is a graph of the output characteristics of
