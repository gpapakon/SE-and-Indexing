<ABSTRACT>
The pressure cooker (1) is intended for household cooking, 
and performes cooking processes at any one of three pressure 

ranges, i.e. high, medium and low pressure, if the vessel 
(2) is fitted with its lid (7), and also frying and grilling 

processes with no lid, them being selected from the control 
panel (10) which indicates whether the cooking pressure is 

normal or abnormal. Heater stand (3), which is adapted to 
take the cooking vessel (2), embodies two temperature 

sensors (22, 23). The attachment between the heater stand 
and the cooking vessel is accomplished by an integral 

upright column (11) which guides a travelling member (4) 
carrying a lid detector, the temperature sensor (22), and 

ducts (12) for conveying the released steam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a household pressure cooker 
that is coupled to a specifically adapted heater stand being 
a self-sufficient appliance having its own means for heating 
and for controlling the cooking parameters. Cooking pots that have heater plates adapted to the 
vessel and provided with means for regulating the power are 
known, like 
the publication of patent EP O 343 325 by SILIT-WERKE, 
where the pressure cooker is provided with an internal 
pressure sensor housed in an adaptor that is coupled to the 
vessel lid, and which is linked to the heater plate simply 
by an not guided electric wire, in order to regulate the 
power during cooking; this arrangement has no means of 
physically coupling the two parts comprising the vessel and 
the heater plate, and shows the disadvantage that the 
various parts of the detector and the means of electrical 
connection are liable to suffer from soiling, moisture and 
being accidentally struck, with the resulting risk of their 
malfunctioning or becoming damaged, while in addition it 
only regulates the cooking with pressure inside the vessel, the publication of patent EP-0 348 298 by SEB, S.A. 
describes a method for regulating the various cooking 
processes in a vessel that is adapted to a heater plate,  
 
based upon temperature measurement in the wall of the vessel 
and the heater element by means of respective sensors 
located inside the plate, which itself is fitted with a 
control unit and a front panel with hand controls; this 
arrangement has no means whereby the vessel is coupled to 
the heater plate, and the bottom of the vessel is merely 
inserted into a sunken hollow on the heater surface, 
allowing no pressure cooking to be done inasmuch as there 
is no connection between the lid of the vessel and the means 
of control. Also known are pressure cookers fitted control micro-controllers 
for boiling processes only, where the relevant 
heating data is stored in a memory and compared against the 
temperature rises during successive "delta t" time intervals 
with the object of adjusting the power range so as to 
regulate the temperature once the cooking temperature value 
has been raised EP-74108, or with the object of adjusting 
the preset cooking time US 4,608,260. With the control device described in US patent 
4,587,405, the elapsing of the cooking time begins to be 
counted once the steam phase has been reached, that is to 
say, at 90Â°C, because the initial heating time is variable, 
and depends upon the amount of food and water that is 
cont

<CLAIMS>
1.- PRESSURE COOKER WITH HEATER STAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM 
comprising a cooking vessel and its lid fitted with a steam 

outlet valve, a heater stand provided with a source of heat, 
upon which the vessel is accurately placed in position, a 

control unit with a micro-controller for timing and 
adjusting the power with a front control panel for selecting 

and monitoring the different cooking processes as they are 
performed, and which in order to regulate the power applied, 

relies upon the temperature measures taken at various points 
about the vessel by means of sensors arranged in the heater 

stand characterized in that to perform the different cooking 
processes with pressure and without pressure by 

automatically regulating the power being applied, the heater 
stand (3) is coupled to the vessel (2) fitted with lid (7) 

for pressure cooking, for which purpose, at the rear of, the 
stand 3 has embodied in itself an upright column (11, 15) 

emerging from the periphery, whose height is adjustable to 
differing amounts as required by different vessels (2) and 

it projects beyond any of such heights, where such upright 
column houses a cooker lid presence detector and a working 

temperature sensor (22) half way up the vessel wall, and 
moreover assists in the positioning of the vessel and its 

lid upon the heater stand. 
2.- PRESSURE COOKER in accordance with the claim 1, wherein 
in a first embodiment of
 the pressure cooker, only one part 
of upright column (11) belongs to the heater stand (3) 

structure, and it supports and guides in an up and down 
motion, a second part that is a travelling member (4) in the 

shape of an upturned "L", the end of whose horizontal arm 
incorporates a lid detector and a protruding button (12) for 

pressure releasing, while concentric to the button, there 
is a lower recess (24) to cover cylindrical protrusion (15) 

of the lid, where the steam outlet valve is housed, while 
 

said protrusion (15) also serving the purpose of accurately 
positioning the vessel upon the heater stand. 
3.- PRESSURE COOKER in accordance with the claim 1, wherein 
that upright column (11) with its travelling member (4) 

houses the electrical connections from the lid detector and 
the cooking process sensor (22) to the control unit (10), 

and it may in addition convey the steam from the outlet to 
a condensate collection chamber (5) located beneath the 

heater stand, or allow it to be released directly to the 
atmosphere by means of pressure release button (12). 
4.- PRESSURE COOKER in accordance with Claim 1, wherein in 
a second embodiment of the pressure cooker the upright 

coupling column (15), upon being straight and rigid 
throughout the whole of its height, contains at its top, 

a lid detector (27) in the shape of a dual key, the ends 
(28) of which are thickened to allow them to come into 

contact with the lid applied to vessels of differing 
heights, and where to achieve, in association with the 

upright column, the accurate positioning of the cooker 
vessel upon the heater stand, this latter is provided with 

a diametrically opposite projection (26). 
5.- PRESSURE COOKER in accordance with Claim 1 wherein the 
power regulation system allows cooking modes to be performed 

using any one of the three preset pressure ranges (HP, MP, 
LP) on the basis of the equivalent temperature values 

recorded in the micro-controller, and by measuring the 
cooking temperature half way up the vessel side wall using 

a probe (22) housed inside the upright column (11). 
6.- PRESSURE COOKER in accordance with Claims 1 and 5 
above, wherein in addition to having operating keys (14, 19) 

and indicator lamps (16, 18) for cooking modes and timer 
settings, the panel of the control unit (10) has a start 

 
button (21) for initiating pressure cooking, and an 

indicator lamp (20) to show whether the pressure during the 
cooking process is normal or abnormal.
