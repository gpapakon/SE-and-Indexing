<ABSTRACT>
A liquid filter for purifying fuels is proposed which is constructed as a housing filter (10) having a detachable housing part (12) and on the cover part (15) of which a filter insert (19) is mounted radially. The filter insert (19) has a main filter element (21) through which flow passes radially and an auxiliary filter element (22) arranged concentrically to the main filter element in the latter, which auxiliary filter element, to increase the service life, can only be activated when the main filter element (21) is filled and a pressure difference occurs via a pressure difference valve (45) connected in series to the auxiliary filter element (21). The pressure difference valve (45) is arranged directly in the cover part (15), as a result of which a simple, compact and inexpensive construction results, in which the filter insert is easily exchangeable.

Liquid filter, especially for the purification of 
fuels, with a housing (11), in which are arranged an 

inflow (13) and an outflow (14), between which are 
inserted, inside the housing, a main filter element (21) 

having a radial throughflow, an auxiliary filter 
element (22) arranged concentrically thereto and a 

differential-pressure valve (45), of which the auxiliary 
filter element and the differential-pressure valve are in 

series with one another and both together are connected 
in parallel with the main filter element between the 

inflow and outflow, so that, with the service life of the 
main filter element expiring and with the differential-pressure 

valve opening as a function of pressure, the 
auxiliary filter element is inserted into the pressure-medium 

stream, and in which the housing consists of a 
cover part (15) having the connections and of a housing 

part (12) which seal off the interior of the housing 
relative to the outside at a first outer sealing 

point (17), and in which the cover part forms with the 
main filter element an annular second sealing point (35) 

between the dirty side and the clean side, characterized 
in that the cover part (15) has a central tubular connection 

piece (34) which forms with the auxiliary filter 
element (22) a third inner sealing point (37) which is 

surrounded by the second sealing point (35), and in that, 
between the second (35) and the third (37) sealing point, 

an inflow duct (32) extending in the cover part (15) 
leads into the interior (18) of the housing (11) and is 

connected to an inflow chamber (29) located between the 
two filter elements (21, 22), in that an outflow  

 
duct (39) extends in the tubular connection piece (34) 

and connects an inner clean space (38) of the auxiliary 
filter element (22) to the outflow (14), in that the 

differential-pressure valve (45) is arranged in the cover 
part (15) and is inserted into the outflow duct (39), and 

in that a passage (61) arranged in the cover part (15) is 
guided, downstream of the differential-pressure 

valve (45), from an outer clean space (36) of the main 
filter element (21) to the outflow (14). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the second sealing point (35) is formed on a 

tube-shaped connection piece (33) of the cover part (15) 
and has a larger diameter than the third sealing 

point (37), and in that these two sealing points (35, 37) 
are designed with sealing elements (26, 28) capable of 

being pushed axially onto the connection pieces (33, 34). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the differential-pressure valve (45) can 

be loaded by the pressure in the inflow chamber (29) 
counter to the force of a spring (51). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the inflow duct (32) and the 

differential-pressure valve (45) are arranged on opposite 
sides with respect to the longitudinal axis of the 

filter (10). 
Liquid filter according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the differential-pressure 

valve (45, 65) is of cartridge-type design and, 
in particular, is arranged parallel to the longitudinal 

axis of the filter (10). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the cover part (15) has a continuous longitudinal 

bore (42) which connects its two end faces (43, 44) and 

into which the differential-pressure valve (45, 65) 
together with its valve sleeve (46) is fitted, the 

longitudinal bore (42) leading into the inner end 
face (44) in the annular region between the second (35) 

and third (37) sealing point. 
Liquid filter according to Claim 6, characterized  
 

in that the differential-pressure valve (45) has a 
slide (47) which, by means of a piston collar (48), 

controls passage orifices (49) in the valve sleeve (46), 
the said passage orifices being connected to the outflow 

duct (39). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 3 to 7, 
characterized in that, to achieve a snap effect, the 

closing member (47) of the differential-pressure 
valve (45) has a first smaller pressure surface which is 

separated from a second larger pressure surface by a 
seat-valve function (52, 53). 
Liquid filter according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the outer end 

face (43) of the cover part (15) is assigned a signal 
transmitter (59) which is coupled to the closing member

sealing point (35) has a diameter which is smaller than 
the outside diameter of the main filter element (21), and

part (12) is releasably connected to the cover part (15).

screw (16) which passes through the central tubular 

connection piece (34) in the outflow duct (39).
