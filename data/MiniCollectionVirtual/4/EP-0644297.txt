<ABSTRACT>
A reflective road stud comprises a hollow plastics body 11, a reflector 
support 19 integral with the body and projecting above the body, and a reflector 23 

supported by the reflector support. The support 19 is deformable into the body 11 
upon receiving an impact from either of two opposite sides of the road stud. Wiper 

means 24 may be provided for cleaning the reflector when the reflector is deformed 
into the body. The road stud may also comprise a housing 10 for receiving and 

locating the hollow plastics body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reflective road stud and more particularly to a 
reflective road stud which is resistant to impact by a snow plough. Snow ploughs in some countries are set to traverse a path slightly above the 
road surface so as to prevent damage to the road surface and to reflective road studs 
set in the road surface. In other countries, the plough is set to make contact with the 
road surface with the result that reflective road studs set in the road surface are 
damaged or destroyed. The present invention seeks to provide a reflective road stud which is 
resistant to impact by a snow plough. According to the present invention there is provided a reflective road stud 
comprising a hollow plastics body, a reflector support integral with the body and 
projecting above the body, and a reflector supported by the reflector support, the 
support being deformable into the body upon receiving an impact from either of two 
opposite sides of the road stud. Preferably, the road stud also comprises wiper means for cleaning the 
reflector when the reflector support is deformed into the body. Preferably, the reflector support lies proud of the hollow plastics body and  
 
includes two ramp surfaces on each of said two opposite sides of the road stud, 
which, when impacted, result in the reflector support being deformed into the body. 
In this case, the reflector support also comprises a bar extending between the two 
ramp surfaces on each of said two opposite sides of the road stud and a reflector on 
at least one and preferably on each side of the bar. Also, in this case, the wiper 
means, when provided, may be in the form of two blades integral with the body and 
extending inwards from opposite sides of the body towards the bar. Advantageously, the hollow body contains a closed cell foam material, a 
blow moulding or solid elastomeric material to prevent ice build up in the body which 
may otherwise resist or prevent deformation of the reflector support into the body. Preferably, the body and support are formed of flexible, impact and 
abrasion resistant, plastics material. Preferably, the road stud also comprises a housing for receiving and 
locating the hollow plastics body. The invention will now be more particularly described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a road stud according 
to the invention,  Figure 2 is a perspective view of the road stud with the outer housing 
omitted, Figure 3 is a side view

<CLAIMS>
A reflective road stud comprising a hollow plastics body (11), a reflector 
support (19) integral with the body and projecting above the body, and a reflector 

(23) supported by the reflector support, the support being deformable into the body 
upon receiving an impact from either of two opposite sides of the road stud. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in claim 1, further comprising means (24) 
for cleaning the reflector when the reflector support is deformed into the body. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
reflector support lies proud of the hollow plastics body and includes two ramp 

surfaces (20) on each of said two opposite sides of the road stud, which, when 
impacted, result in the reflector support being deformed into the body. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in claim 3, wherein the reflector support 
also comprises a bar (22) extending between the two ramp surface
s (20) on each of 
said two opposite sides of the road stud and a reflector (23) on at least one side of the 

bar. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 when dependent on 
claim 2, wherein the wiper means is in the form of two blades (24) integral with the 

body and extending inwards from opposite sides of the body towards the bar. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the hollow body contains a closed cell foam material (28), a blow moulding 

or solid elastomeric material to prevent ice build up in the body which may otherwise 
resist or prevent deformation of the reflector support into the body. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the body and support are formed of flexible, impact and abrasion resistant, 

plastics material. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
further comprising a housing (10) for receiving and locating the hollow plastics body. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in claim 8, wherein the hollow plastics 
body is a snap fit in the housing. 
A reflective road stud as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9, wherein the 
housing is also formed of plastics material.
