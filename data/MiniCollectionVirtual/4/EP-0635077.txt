<ABSTRACT>
A slot draw attenuator apparatus and method are provided for producing webs of spunbonded thermoplastic filaments having improved cover even at low basis weights. The filaments are introduced to a slot draw attenuator having corona electrodes mounted in an elongate insulator bar and staggered and spaced along one wall of the attenuator slot near the exit end thereof. The corona electrodes are electrically connected to a high voltage source. The opposing wall of the slot is grounded. A corona is created in the attenuator slot so that the filaments are charged as they exit the attenuator. The electrostatic charge induces repelling forces in the filaments so that the filaments spread before they are randomly deposited upon a forming belt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for producing a web of spunbonded thermoplastic 
filaments, and more particularly relates to an 
apparatus and method for producing a spunbonded web of 
enhanced uniformity and quality. The spunbonding process is widely used for 
producing nonwoven fabrics from thermoplastic 
filaments. Spunbonded fabrics can be produced by many 
routes, but the majority of spunbonding processes 
include the basic steps of extruding continuous 
filaments of a fiber-forming thermoplastic polymer, 
quenching the filaments, drawing or attenuating the 
filaments, usually by a high velocity fluid, and 
depositing the filaments on a collection surface to 
form a web. Manufacturers of spunbonded nonwoven fabrics 
have long sought to improve the manufacturing process 
to achieve higher productivity and better quality and  
 
uniformity of the spunbonded nonwoven fabric. 
Maintaining the quality and uniformity of the fabric 
becomes a particular concern at higher production 
speeds and when producing fabrics of low basis weight. 
Several characteristics affect the quality and 
uniformity of spunbonded nonwoven fabrics. Filament separation is the degree of 
separation of the individual filaments from one 
another. Good filament separation occurs when the 
filaments are randomly arranged with limited parallel 
contact between the filaments. Ideally, no individual 
filaments should be in parallel contact with another 
filament, although, in practice, filaments tend to be 
in parallel contact over considerable distances. Good 
filament separation is particularly important for light 
weight fabrics, where good coverage is more difficult 
to achieve. Ropiness is the extreme state of poor 
filament separation. Large numbers of filaments in 
parallel twisted contact result in long strands in the 
fabric, which can causes holes or very thin areas in 
the fabric. Splotchiness is a relative large-scale 
non-uniformity in basis weight. A fabric having 
splotchiness is generally weak because of the lower 
tensile strength of the thin areas of the fabric. 
Also, a splotchy fabric generally has poor cover 
properties. In the early spunbond processes which used 
round attenuator tubes to attenuate and draw the  
 
filaments, achieving good uniformity and adequate cover 
presented significant challenges, particularly when 
manufacturers attempted to produce lighter weight webs 
or to produce webs at higher speeds or reduced cost. 
The round attenuator tubes, often called Lurgi tubes,
