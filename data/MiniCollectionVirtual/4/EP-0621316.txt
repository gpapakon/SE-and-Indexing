<ABSTRACT>
An organic silicon compound having at 
least one ≡ SiH group in a molecule and a 

fluorinated organic group at either end is a 
useful crosslinking agent for various resins, 

especially fluorinated resins. An organopolysiloxane 
composition comprising (A) an organopolysiloxane 

having in a molecule at least two 
alkenyl groups and at least one fluorinated 

substituent, (B) an organohydrogenpolysiloxane 
having at least two ≡ SiH groups in a molecule 

and a fluorinated organic group at either end, 
and (C) a platinum catalyst is readily curable 

to products having solvent and moisture 
resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel organic
silicon compound having a hydrogen atom directly
attached to a silicon atom (or a silylidyne
≡ SiH group) in a molecule and a fluorinated
group at either end, which is useful as a
crosslinking agent for various resins. It also
relates to an organopolysiloxane composition
which is readily curable to products having
solvent and moisture resistance and thus
suitable for use as electronic part
encapsulants, sealants and coating agents.Heretofore, addition curing type silicone
compositions have been used in a variety of
fields. These silicone compositions cure by
crosslinking through hydrosilylation reaction
represented by the following reaction scheme. 
≡ SiH + CH2=CHSi ≡
↓ Pt compound
≡ SiCH2CH2Si ≡
In this reaction, the siloxane having a ≡ SiH
group is used as a crosslinking agent.
Illustrative examples of the siloxane used are
given below.
However, when the above-mentioned
crosslinking agent is blended in a fluorinated
silicone composition having a high fluorine
content, the resulting composition is less
curable because the agent is incompatible with
the composition. Additionally, according to our
finding, the composition has another drawback
that it lacks adherence. Even when a tackifier
is further added to the composition, a cured
product obtained therefrom hardly adheres to
various substrates.It was recently proposed to improve
compatibility by using as a crosslinking agent a
silylidyne ( ≡ SiH) group-containing siloxane
compound having a fluorinated group in a side
chain represented by the following general
formula.
In the formula, Rf is a fluorinated
substituent selected from groups of the
following formulae:
CjF2j+1-(CH2)m-
wherein m is an integer of 1 to 4, n is an
integer of 1 to 6 and j is an integer of 1 to
12.This siloxane compound, however, is
not easy to make into an organopolysiloxane
composition which is effectively curable into a
product having adequate adhesion, because the Rf group in
the side chain causes steric hindrance of the ≡ SiH
group. Therefore, it is desired to overcome
these problems of curable organopolysiloxane
compositions.The present invention may
provide an organic silicon compound which is
well compatible with various resins, typically
fluorinated resins, and advantageous as a
crosslinking agent for addition curing type
fluorinated silicone compositions and other
compositions of resins having an aliphatic
unsaturated group in that the resulting 
compositions are effectively curable into
products having solvent resistance and
