<ABSTRACT>
A printing method and apparatus for recording on a 
printing medium in which an image having a mark is 

printed on the printing medium by a method, such as 
screen printing, other than the ink-jet method. An 

image is then printed on the printing medium as by the 
ink-jet method. At such time the mark that has been 

printed on the printing medium is detected and a 

corresponding image is printed, on the image already 
printed on the printing medium, on the basis of the 

position of the mark detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printing method and
apparatus for performing printing through a sequential
method by scanning a plurality of printing heads, as
well as to printed matter obtained by this printing
method and a processed article obtained by working the
printed matter.Conventional textile printing methods for printing
on fabrics or textiles mainly are of two types, namely
roller textile printing in which a pattern is engraved
in a roller and the roller is pressed against a cloth to
produce a continuous design, and screen textile printing
in which a printing plate is fabricated into the shape
of a screen and the number of screen plates used
corresponds to the number of colors desired to be
superimposed and the number of patterns desired to be
overlapped. A printing apparatus which has been put
into practical use as a substitute for these methods
applies an ink-jet printing system to cloth. A printer and a copying apparatus employing paper
as the printing medium are known as printing apparatus
that perform ink-jet printing. Such a printing
apparatus jets a plurality of inks of the primary colors
in the form of a dot matrix on the printing medium so
that it is possible to express a diversity of colors by
mixing colors, wherein the colors are mixed by arranging
or superposing dots. This makes it possible to provide
an entirely new design environment. Since the apparatus
produces little noise, the effects upon the surroundings
are reduced. In addition, the apparatus is capable of
revolutionizing the manufacturing site. For these
reasons, the aforementioned printing apparatus has
become the focus of much attention.However, certain problems arise when cloth is
adopted as the printing medium. Specifically, the term
"cloth" includes not only natural fibers such as cotton,
silk and fur but also synthetic fibers such as nylon,
polyester and acrylic fiber. Various technical
difficulties arise depending upon the type of printing
medium, example of which are as mentioned.In techniques for printing on cloth using the
conventional ink-jet method, textile printing is carried
out by jetting the ink in the form of droplets and
causing the ink to attach itself to the cloth in the
form of a dot matrix. As a consequence, the following 
drawbacks arise:
(1) When the same color is printed uniformly, the
printed image develops stripes and other irregularities
owing to uneven jetting of the ink from each nozzle of
the ink-jet head. This invites a decline in picture
quality and can lead to a decline in the commercial
valu

detecting means (57) is arranged to detect a mark in at

least one of a direction perpendicular to a feed
direction of said print medium and the feed direction.
A system according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
additional printing means comprises separate mark

printing means for printing a mark by using a different
printing ink from that used by said ink-jet print means.

recording head is arranged to eject ink by utilizing

thermal energy and has a thermal-energy converting
element for generating thermal energy to be applied to

the ink.
A printing method for printing on a textile medium,
comprising:


a first step (251) of printing a part of a desired
image and a mark on the textile medium using a roller or

screen printing method, and
a second step (252) of detecting the mark printed
on the textile medium with the part of the desired image

in said first step and of printing a corresponding image

different from the part of the desired image printed in
said first printing step by discharging ink using an ink-jet printing method onto the

textile medium in accordance with the detected position
of the mark.
