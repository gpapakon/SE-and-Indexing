<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides robust designs for heaters utilizing 
ceramic and metam-ceramic heating elements. More specifically, this invention 
provides designs for heaters using heating elements of thin to medium 
thickness. Ceramic and ceramic composite heating wires are brittle in comparison 
to metallic wires. Yet they are preferred to metallic heating elements on 
account of both a higher resistivity and a much higher temperature of possible 
use. Typical ceramic heating element wires are made out of MoSi2, SiC, WSi2, 
ZrO2, etc., sometimes composited with Al2O3 SiO2, etc. Metallic heating elements wires, on account of their ductility and lower 
temperatures of use, may often be coiled and embedded in refractories to 
facilitate easy application and unit wise repair. On account of their high 
ductility, the metallic heating wires (typically containing Ni, Cr, Al, Fe, etc.) 
may be easily configured into the required furnace design without much effort 
and thought. On the other hand when designing furnaces with ceramic/ceramic 
composite heating elements (hereinafter called cerheaters), the design of the 
furnace configuration must take into account the following factors. 1. creep 
(deformation of an article at high temperatures under its own weight); 2. 
reactivity with refractories; 3. extreme brittleness of heating elements at low  
 
temperatures; 4. large change in resistivity with temperature; 5. atmosphere of 
use; 6. connectors; 7. thermal fatigue; 8. thermal expansion; 9. loretz force 
repulsion. Thus it can be seen that cerheater design is often very complex and 
involved. The problem of design becomes even more severe in applications which 
require use of elements having thicknesses (i.e., the diameter of heating 
element wires) less than 12 mm, especially in the range of 1 to 2 mm. At such 
small thickness, the brittleness problems and problems associated with creep, 
become more pronounced. Thin wires are preferred in fumace design because 
the amount of current required (electricity) and associated component costs 
significantly diminish for the same temperature and wattage of the furnace, for 
reduced thickness elements when compared to elements having larger thickness. To date, the typical use of cerheaters made from, for e.g., MoSi2, have 
been in the hanging U configuration. As MoSi2 is prone to large expansion and 
creep (especially when the heating zone of the element is long), this 
configuration has been deemed most appropriate for use in high temperature 
furnaces. On
