<ABSTRACT>
An inclined counterflow rotating drum mixer has 
a burner head (22) intermediate an aggregate inlet 

(14) at one end of the drum and an asphaltic concrete 
discharge (18) at the opposite end of the drum (12). 

A fan supplies secondary air to the burner (22) 
through a motive tube having an opening in 

communication with a mixing chamber (26) between the 
burner head (22) and the discharge end of the drum 

(12) to aspirate gases from the mixing chamber (26) 
for flow through the burner flame. The aspiration 

creates a negative pressure in the mixing chamber 
(26) , causing a reverse flow of a portion of the 

combustion gases from the dryer chamber (24) into the 
mixing chamber (26) for preheating RAP input to the 

mixing chamber (26). RAP is also preheated by 
providing a preheat chamber (50) adjacent the flame 

zone but segregated from direct contact with the flame 
to preheat the RAP. Hot and dried virgin aggregate is 

mixed with the RAP in the preheat chamber (50) and 
valves (66) are provided to prevent gases evolved from 

the RAP in the preheat chamber (50) from flowing into 
the drying chamber (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drum mixer for heating and
drying aggregate and mixing the aggregate with liquid asphalt and/or
recycled asphalt product to form asphaltic concrete and particularly
relates to a counterflow drum mixer with hot gas stream recirculation and
preheat of recyclable asphaltic product.Many and various types of drum mixers for making asphaltic
concrete have been known, proposed and/or used in the past. One
such drum mixer has an inclined drum rotatable about its axis and
having an inlet at its upper end and an asphaltic concrete product outlet
at its lower end. A burner assembly extends through the breeching at
the lower end of the drum and mounts a burner head spaced from the
lower drum end to define a drying chamber between the burner head
and the aggregate inlet and an annular mixing chamber between the
burner head and the asphaltic concrete product outlet. Flighting is
typically spaced circumferentially about and longitudinally along the
interior wall of the drying section of the drum to carry and veil aggregate
input to the drum at its upper end. Hot gases of combustion from the
burner flame flow in the drying section concurrently to the direction of
flow of the aggregate through the drum, the hot gases flowing through
the veiling aggregate to remove dust and moisture from the aggregate
and exiting the drum for flow to a separator, e.g., a baghouse. The mixing section comprises the annular chamber between the burner
tube assembly projecting into the drum from its lower end wall and the drum
walls. A liquid asphalt pipe extends into the mixing chamber for discharging
liquid asphalt onto the dried aggregate flowing into the mixing chamber
whereby the dried aggregate and asphalt form asphaltic concrete.Used or recycled asphaltic product and/or mineral filler, dust and/or
additives may also be disposed in the drum for mixing in the mixing chamber
with the aggregate whereby the asphaltic concrete comprises virgin aggregate
and recycled asphaltic product and with/or without applied liquid asphalt.
Drums of this type have been successfully used for many years in the asphalt
industry. A recurring and constant problem whenever asphalt and hot gases or
flame are used in conjunction with one another is the "blue smoke" generated by
the burning and/or volatilization of the asphalt. This causes environmental
problems and it is therefore highly desirable to eliminate any production of blue
smoke. Additionally, efficiencies in heating the virgin aggregate, as well as the
recycled
