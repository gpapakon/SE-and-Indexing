<ABSTRACT>
Simulation of glazed panes framed along a lower margin by two substantially horizontal beads (17), joined by a first upwardly arched central portion (19), along an upper margin by a second arched portion (20) defining corner recesses with the side frame members (14) and the top frame member (13), and also framed by beads (22) extending between the inner and outer arched portions (19, 20). The second arched portion (20) is formed by a bead portion interlocked at each end (20a) to a respective side frame member (14) and at its apex to the top frame member (13), and infill panels (21) are located in the corner recesses.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DOOR OR WINDOWThis invention relates to a door or window which includes one or more glazed units, and when in window form may comprise an openable window or a fixed window.For convenience, a door or window to which the invention may be applied will be referred to hereinafter as a "building panel".However, the invention has been developed primarily in connection with a door having one or more glazed units incorporated therein, for the purposes of admitting external light to pass through the door, and seeks to provide a door frame made of extruded plastics, preferably UPVC, to form the structure of the door, but which can incorporate glazing framed in such a way as to mimic styles traditionally only available with wood framed doors.Examples of traditional style of wood doors include a "fan light" or half moon effect, and which appears as a separate unit, or which forms a semi-circular top to a traditional appearance of separate rectangular panes arranged side by side and in vertical columns, separated by profiled wooden beads.Traditional styles available in wood remain popular, but there exists a significant commercial potential for traditional styles to be provided using modern and substantially maintenance free materials, such as UPVC, to form the structural part of the door previously made of wood in traditional designs of door. However, in seeking to fulfil this requirement, there are two conflicting considerations to be taken into account.Thus, the use of modern materials necessarily involves mass production techniques to minimise labour costs in manufacture and assembly, whereas the traditional styles previously available in wood required time and skill to produce, and therefore it is a difficult design and manufacturing task to provide a commercially acceptable mimicking of traditional styles using extruded plastics material to form the structure of the door. 

 Attempts made to date have a relatively high labour and skill content to provide a commercially acceptable product, and the invention therefore seeks to provide an improved design of building panel, and more especially a door, having one or more glazed units incorporated therein, and which successfully mimics traditional and other styles of framing of glazed unit(s), but in a way which minimises the need for repeated application of special skills i.e. the inherent design enables reliable mass production on a repeatable basis of an acceptable finished product without the need for special craft skills in assembly.According to the invention

CLAI S
1. A building panel (10) comprising a rectangular frame of extruded plastics having a generally horizontal top frame member (13) interconnecting two side frame members (14) at two upper corner joints (15), a glazed unit (16) mounted in the frame, and a simulation of glazed panes framed along a lower margin by two substantially horizontal beads (17) spaced apart at their inner ends (18) and joined by a first upwardly arched central portion (19), along an upper margin by a second arched portion (20) upstanding from the outer ends (17) of the horizontal beads (17) and defining corner recesses with the side frame members (14) and the top frame member (13), and also framed by beads (22) extending between the inner and outer arched portions (19, 20) and circumferentially spaced along said portions (19, 20); in which the second arched portion (20) is formed by a bead portion or portions interlocked at each end (20a) to a respective side frame member (14) and at its apex to the top frame member (13), and infill panels (26) are located in said corner recesses.
2. A building panel according to Claim 1, in which a rectangular glazed unit (16) is mounted in the upper part of the frame, with a top horizontal edge of the unit (16) being mounted closely adjacent to the top frame member (13), and the two upright sides of the unit (16) being mounted closely adjacent to the two upright side frame members (14) in the regions thereof which run to make a jointed connection (15) with the top frame member (13).
3. A building panel according to Claim 1 or 2, in which each arched portion (19, 20) is semi-circular, or approximately semi-circular, so that the simulated framed pane formation is half-moon shaped.
4. A building panel according to Claim 3, in which the beads (22) extending between the inner and outer arched portions (19, 20) extend radially, to simulate a "fan light" effect. 


 5. A building panel according to Claim 3 or 4, in which che inner arched portion (19) is formed by the upper periphery of a semi-circular decorative infill panel (21), said periphery being profiled to adopt, or to mount, a generally bead profile.
6. A building panel according to Claim 5, in which the decorative infill panel (21 ) is located in position by a locking engagement along its lower edge with a horizontal frame member (29) interconnecting the side frame members (14) and spaced downwardly from the top frame member (13).
7. A building panel according to Claim 6, in which the decorative infill panel (21 ) is further secured in position by adhesive means which joins the inner face of the panel to the underlying glazed unit (16).
8. A building panel according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, in which the infill panels (26) located in each of the corner recesses have horizontal top edges and vertical side edges to lie alongside the top frame member (13) and the two side frame members (14), and have curved sides facing inwardly which correspond with the curvature of the outer arched portion (20) .
9. A building panel according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, in which the infill panels (26) are located in position by adhesive means to adhere the panels directly to the underlying glazed unit (16).
10. A building panel according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, in which the glazed unit (16) is a double glazed unit.
11. A building panel according to any one of Claims 1 to 10 and comprising a door (10).
