<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONMETHOD AND REAGENT FOR TREATMENT OF ANIMAL DISEASESBackground of the Invention This invention relates to methods for inhibition of various animal diseases, including: a) inflammatory disease, in particular the inhibition of genetic expression which leads to the reduction or elimination of immune cell proliferation in inflammation or pre- inflammatory conditions; b) osteoarthritis, in particular, inhibition of genetic expression which leads to a reduction or elimination of extracellular matrix digestion by matrix etalloproteinases; c) a stenotic condition, in particular the inhibition of genetic expression which leads to the reduction or elimination of cellular proliferation in the areas of restenotic plaques; and d) cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, and in particular, those mediated by angiotensin converting enzyme activity. Inflammatory diseaseInflammation is a tissue reaction to irritation, infection or injury marked by localized heat, swelling, redness, pain and sometimes loss of function. When tissues sustain physiological injury, the afflicted cells synthesize and/or release chemicals (cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules) which attract lymphoid cells and accelerate cell growth which is required for healing. The infiltration of lymphoid cells to the wound leads to the release of more biological response modifying molecules, which include vasoregulatory substances such as bradykinin and immunoregulatory molecules exemplified by the interleukin family of proteins. As healing occurs, the immune cell infiltration wanes and the inflammatory process ceases. Under certain physiological conditions, such as those observed in psoriasis, asthma, head injuries 

and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) , the condition persists because of inappropriate cellular controls. A persistent inflammatory condition may be acute or chronic and is generically referred to as inflammatory disease.Inflammatory disease is exemplified by psoriasis, which is a skin disease caused by excessive growth of basal keratinocytes in the epidermis. It is believed that this uncontrolled growth of the keratinocytes results from stimulation by infiltrating T-cells. The conversion of normal skin to a psoriatic lesion is initiated by injury to the tissue and subsequent recognition of the injury by circulating immune cells. An acute inflammatory reaction ensues and results in the release of various cytokines and growth factors, including tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) . A
