<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
polymerizing alpha-olefins, a catalyst for such a 
polymerization and a method for producing such a 
catalyst. A particular aspect of the present invention 
relates to a method for producing linear low density 
copolymers of ethylene, hereinafter referred to as 
"LLDPE". Linear low density polyethylene polymers possess 
properties which distinguish them from other 
polyethylene polymers such as homopolymers of 
polyethylene. Certain of these properties are 
described in US-A-4076698. When the LLDPE resins are fabricated into 
injection-molded products, it is imperative to assure 
that such products are not susceptible to warping or 
shrinking. As is known to those skilled in the art, 
the degree of warping or shrinking can be predicted 
from the molecular weight distribution of the resins. 
Resins having a relatively narrow molecular weight 
distribution produce injection-molded products 
exhibiting a minimum amount of warping or shrinkage. 
Conversely, resins having a relatively broader 
molecular weight distribution produce injection-molded 
products more likely to undergo warping or shrinkage. One of the measures of the molecular weight 
distribution of the resin is melt flow ratio (MFR), 
which is the ratio of high melt flow index (HLMI or 
I21) to melt index (I2) for a given resin. MFR is 
defined herein as the ratio of the high load melt index 
(HLMI or I21) divided by the melt index (I2), i.e., 
MFR = I21I2 
The melt flow ratio is believed to be an indication of 
the molecular weight distribution of the polymer, the 
higher the value, the broader the molecular weight  
 
distribution. Resins having relatively low MFR values, 
e.g., of 20 to 50, have relatively narrow 
molecular weight distribution. Additionally, LLDPE 
resins having such relatively low MFR values produce 
films of better strength properties than resins with 
high MFR values. By comparison, the molecular weight per se of the 
polymer may be controlled in a known manner, e.g., by 
using hydrogen. With the catalysts produced according 
to the present invention, molecular weight may be 
suitably controlled with hydrogen when the 
polymerization is carried out at relatively low 
temperatures, e.g., from 30 to 105°C. This 
control of molecular weight may be evidenced by 
measurable positive change in melt index (I2) of the 
polymer produced. Another important property of an ethylene and 
alpha-olefin copolymerization catalyst composition is 
the ability thereof to effectively copolymerize
