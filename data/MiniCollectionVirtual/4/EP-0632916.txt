A three-dimensional energy distribution device 
including a volume (30) reacting to the energy of a 

predetermined radiation; and characterized in that it 
comprises: 


a plurality of sources of said radiation illuminating 
said volume according to respective angles (A₁, A₂, 

A₃...); and, 
placed between each source and the volume, a support 
(D₁, D₂, D₃...) that is transparent to said radiation 

and that includes an image corresponding to a density 
projection of a real or virtual object examined at 

the angle the respective source illuminates the volume, 
said projection having been subjected to an image correction 

process. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that the image correction 

process is intended to correct distortions due to illumination 
conditions of the volume (30) and/or to examination 

conditions of the object. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that means are provided to 

render the rays of each source parallel to each other 
when they penetrate into said volume (30), and wherein 

the correction process is a Shep and Logan filtering. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 3, characterized in that said volume (30) is 

included within a sphere (36) transparent to said radiation 
and whose diameter is selected so that said rays 

become parallel to each other when they penetrate into 
the sphere.  

 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that said volume (30) is 

transparent and includes a product that is fluorescent to 
said radiation. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that said volume (30) is a 

resin that locally polymerizes as a function of the radiation 
energy. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that said support is a 

slide. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that said support is a 

liquid crystal screen. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that said sources are optical 

fibers connected to a single source. 
The three-dimensional energy distribution device 
of claim 1, characterized in that said sources are realized 

from a conical laser beam illuminating mirrors that 
reflect a portion of said conical beam to the supports.
