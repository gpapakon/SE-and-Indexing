<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to material dispensers of the type 
including a container having a mouth or neck, an elongated 
applicator that can be inserted and withdrawn through the 
container neck for picking up and transporting a quantity of 
material from the container, and a wiper associated with the neck 
for removing excess material from the applicator as the applicator 
is withdrawn through the neck. The invention is specifically 
directed to dispensers of such type having new and improved means 
for retaining the wiper in the neck. The dispensers that are the subject of the invention are 
adapted to hold a small amount of material for direct end-use 
application. A typical applicator for such dispensers is a brush 
or similar material conveying/applying head carried on a stem or 
shaft projecting from a holder, which the user manipulates to 
apply the material. The term "material" herein refers to materials that can be 
picked up by the applicator, as exemplified by substances which 
are themselves liquid or incorporate a liquid vehicle, e.g. 
liquid and pasty cosmetic substances such as mascara. In 
important embodiments, the invention is directed to dispensers 
for liquid or pasty cosmetic materials, especially mascara, to 
which detailed reference will be made herein for purposes of 
specific illustration. A conventional mascara dispenser includes a container with 
an externally threaded neck for receiving an internally threaded 
container cap. The cap also serves as the applicator holder used 
to manipulate the brush or other applicator head. Typically, 
when the cap is seated on the neck, the applicator head is 
immersed in the mascara. As the cap is removed from the  
 
container, the applicator shaft and head are withdrawn through 
the neck, transporting a quantity of the mascara for immediate 
application to the user's eyelashes. Customarily a flexible wiper is mounted in the dispenser 
neck to engage the applicator head as the applicator is withdrawn 
from the dispenser. This flexible wiper removes excess material 
from the head and/or the shaft allowing the excess material to 
fall back or flow back into the container. A typical or 
preferred form of wiper includes an elastic annular lip disposed 
in the container neck in surrounding relation to the path of the 
applicator through the neck. Such a wiper is shaped and 
dimensioned to engage the applicator snugly and conformingly as 
the applicator is withdrawn through the neck. The wiper may also 
include a sealing portion disposed at the
