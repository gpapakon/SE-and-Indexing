<ABSTRACT>
In response to user input from a computer pointing device such as a 
track ball, activation of an icon causes at least one pair of adjacent 

opposing scroll icons such as arrows to be dynamically created on 
opposing ends of a display screen. Subsequent selection of either of the 

arrows causes scrolling of contents of a window in a corresponding 
respective one of a pair of opposing directions. Required conventional 

pointing device movement is minimized when alternate scrolling in 
opposing directions is desired due to the dynamically created arrows 

being adjacent, whereby conventional traversal of a cursor over large 
display screen distances between opposing non-adjacent arrows is thereby 

avoided. In an alternate embodiment, space-apart scroll icons point in 
opposing directions, whereby activating either arrow dynamically creates 

an adjacent opposing arrow, thereby completing the arrow pair necessary 
to scroll in either direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to user interfaces, and more particularly, 
to improved systems and methods for interacting with electronic visual 
displays such as computer screens and the like. Electronic user interfaces are typically provided in various 
systems such as computers, image editors, games, and the like which 
facilitate the user's interaction with the system by means of pointing 
devices such as a mouse, joystick, track ball, stylus pad, or the like. 
In such systems, a display screen such as screen 10 of a monitor 4 in 
Fig. 1 is employed which provides the user with visual feedback and 
permits his or her interaction with the system. Such interaction is by 
means of spatially positioning a cursor 2 on the screen and then 
indicating a desired action at the cursor location by means of activating 
a button or the like on the pointing device. These screens are typically 
provided in a conventional video monitor, or in the case of a notebook, 
laptop, or other portable computer environment in the form of a 
relatively small liquid crystal display screen which folds and unfolds as 
part of the computer. In such instances of a display screen for use in a portable 
computer environment or other instances when the physical dimensions of 
the screen itself are severely constrained, various techniques have been 
developed for controlling the selective display of only a portion of a 
larger set of data, as by means, for example, of the familiar window 11 
of Fig. 3 well known in the art. This window permits only a desired 
portion of the entire dataset to be displayed on the screen 10. This is 
typically done by means of various scrolling technologies to be 
hereinafter described in greater detail. In such environments, various conventions have developed with 
respect to such windows 11 which, for background purposes, will now be 
described in greater detail with continued reference to Fig. 3. A 
typical window 11 visible on the display screen 10 will include a title 
bar 14 and one or more scroll bars such as horizontal scroll bar 16 and 
vertical scroll bar 18. Various types of data 13 may be displayed in the 
window 11 such as text and graphics, however such data 13 may typically  
 
only appear in the work area 12 e.g. window and not in the title bar 14 
or horizontal and/or vertical scroll bar areas 16 and 18. The title bar 14 typically includes icons or text such that when a 
cursor 2 is located proximal thereto or on the icon and activated by 
means of clicking a mouse button or the like,

<CLAIMS>
A method for improving user interactions with a computerized visual 
display having at least a first icon and a corresponding user 

actuatable first function, comprising 
   selecting said first icon; and 

   automatically creating a second icon on said display adjacent 
said first icon in response to said selecting said first icon 

having a corresponding user-actuatable second function related to 
said first function. 
The method of Claim 1 further including the steps of: 
   detecting after said step of automatically creating said 

second icon when said first and second functions will not be 
activated; and
 
   automatically removing said second icon from said display in 

response to said detecting. 
The method of Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said first function 
corresponds to a scrolling of data or graphics in a corresponding 

first direction on said display. 
The method of Claim 3, wherein said second function corresponds to 
said scrolling in a corresponding second direction on said display. 
The method of Claim 4 wherein said first and second directions are 
opposing. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein said first and second 
icons are indicators of said first and second directions, 

respectively. 
The method of Claim 2 further including 
   monitoring said user interaction prior to said step of 

automatically creating said second icon; and
 

   wherein said detecting step includes 
      monitoring said user interactions after said step of 

automatically creating said second icon; and 
      comparing said monitored user interactions prior to and 

after said step of automatically creating said second 
icon. 
The method of Claim 2 including 
   predefining at least one of said user interactions prior to 

said selecting said first icon; 
   monitoring said user interaction after said step of 

automatically creating said second icon; and 
   wherein said detecting step comprises 

      detecting when said user interaction after said 
creating said second icon corresponds to said 

predefined and at least one user interaction. 
The method of Claim 8 wherein said predefined at least one user 
interaction comprises 

   a user action after said automatic creation of said second 
icon at a location on said display exceeding a predefined distance 

from said first icon. 
The method of Claim 8 wherein said display includes at least one 
user actuatable pull-down or pop-up menu and wherein said 

predefined at least one user interaction comprises said user 
actuation of said at least one pull-down or pop-up menu. 
The method of Claim 8 wherein said display includes a plurality of 
windows; and said predefined at least one user interaction 

comprises 
   user interaction with a first of said windows after said 

activation of said first icon; and
 

   user actuation of a second of said windows 
      after said interaction with said first window and 

      before said removing of said second icon. 
The method of Claim 8 further including the steps of 
   executing a computer application displaying on said visual 

display; 
   wherein said selecting said first icon is in response to said

   wherein said predefined at least one of said user 

interactions is predefined as a function of said executing computer 
application.
