<ABSTRACT>
A gear arrangement for interconnecting a pair of gear wheels (10, 18) which 
are carried on rotary shafts the rotary axes (12A, 20A) of which intersect, 

comprise a toothed rack (16) having two rows of teeth (14 ,22) for engagement 
with the wheels respectively. The rack is resiliently biased into engagement 

with the gear wheels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gear arrangement, for instance for use in a 
rotary position transducer. It is known to measure the rotary position of a shaft by using a spur gear 
arrangement as shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. The gear 
shafts 1 and 2 are held within a housing (not shown) so as to hold the gears 3 
and 4 in engagement. The shaft 1 is the shaft whose rotary position is to be 
determined and the shaft 2 is coupled to or forms part of a potentiometer. The 
housing and the gears are made of different materials. For example, the gears 
may be steel so that the gears are strong, but the housing may be of aluminium 
or an alloy so as to reduce the overall weight of the arrangement. Weight 
reduction may be especially important in an aeronautical application. However, using different materials for the gears and the housing gives rise to 
the possibility of differential thermal expansion between the material of the 
gears and the material of the housing causing the meshing of the gears to be 
affected by temperature. Thus, changes in temperature change the distance 
by which the gear teeth interlock. Such changes in distance introduce 
backlash between the gears and produce errors in the measurement of the 
position of the shaft. It is further known to provide an intermediate gear in the form of an elongate 
rack 5 biased by springs 6 into engagement with the gears 3 and 4, as shown 
in Figure 2. However, if the housing and the rack are formed from different 
materials temperature changes can introduce spurious measurements since the 
relative expansion of the rack and housing can cause one of the gears to rotate 
when the other gear remains stationary. According to the invention, there is provided a gear arrangement comprising a  
 
first gear mounted on a first shaft having a first axis, a second gear mounted on 
a second shaft having a second axis, and a linear rack having first and second 
rows of teeth resiliently biased into engagement with the first and second 
gears, respectively, said first and second axes substantially intersecting each 
other. Preferably the first and second axes are perpendicular to each other. Preferably the teeth of the first row project in a plane perpendicular to a plane 
in which the teeth of the second row project. Thus the rack maintains uniform engagement with the first and second gears 
substantially irrespective of the degree of thermal expansion exhibited by the 
first and second gears or by a housing or supporting structure, so that it

<CLAIMS>
A gear arrangement comprising a first gear (10, 48) mounted on a first 
shaft (12, 40) having a first axis of rotation (12A), a second gear (18, 54) 

mounted on a second shaft (20, 56) having a second axis of rotation (20A), 
characterised by a linear rack (16, 50) having first and second rows of teeth 

(14, 22) which are resiliently biased into engagement with the first and second 
gears respectively, said first and second axes (12A, 20A) intersecting each 

other. 
A gear arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised by resilient 
means (36, 58) acting to bias the rack into engagement with the gears. 
A gear arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that said 
resilient means comprises a coiled compression spring (36, 38) the axis of 

which is aligned so as to generate force components which urge the rack into 
engagement with the first and second gears. 
A gear arrangement according to Claim 3, characterised in that the rack 
(16) is slidably located within a sleeve (30), the sleeve defining an aperture 

(32) to permit engagement of the rack with the gear wheels, the spring (36, 58) 
acting on the sleeve adjacent one end thereof and the sleeve being pivotally 

mounted on a pivot (34) located adjacent the other end of the sleeve. 
A gear arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that said first 
and second axes (12A, 20A) are perpendicular to each other.
