<ABSTRACT>
A paper web feeding apparatus of a cigarette 
manufacturing machine is permitted to be 

simultaneously mounted at its two rotating shafts with 
two reels around which paper webs of a maximum roll 

diameter are respectively wound. This apparatus 
further includes variable-diameter holders for 

removably mounting the reels on the rotating shafts, 
which are rotatably supported on the body of the 

feeding apparatus. Each holder includes a plurality 
of movable holder elements supported by the associated 

rotating shaft for movement in the radial direction of 
the shaft. As a taper cam, which is attached to the 

distal end of a shaft driven by an air cylinder, 
reciprocates along the axis of the rotating shaft, 

each holder element moves between a reel mounting 
position and a reel removing position, whereby the 

reel is attached to or detached from the rotating 
shaft. When the remainder of the paper web on one of 

the reels becomes insufficient, a virgin paper web 
wound on the other reel is connected to the web in 

service, so that paper web supply can be continued. 
An electrical brakes is used to apply an optimum 

braking force to the reel, thereby stabilizing tension 
on the paper web.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a belt-shaped
material feeding apparatus
of a cigarette
manufacturing machine according to the preamble of claim 1.A cigarette manufacturing machine is provided
with a winder for continuously forming cigarette rods
by wrapping cut tobacco in a paper web, and an
apparatus for feeding the paper web to the winder.
Generally, the paper web feeding apparatus comprises
two bobbin mounting shafts which are rotatably
supported on the body of the apparatus. A bobbin
(corresponding to a reel mentioned later) wound with
the paper web is mounted on each mounting shaft by
means of a bobbin holder. Thus, the feeding apparatus
can be fitted with two paper web bobbins. This
arrangement is intended for the improvement of
productivity, allowing the paper web bobbins to be
replaced without suspending the operation of the
winder or the paper web supply.For a compact design of the paper web feeding
apparatus, for example, the bobbin mounting shaft on
the winder side or the lower-course side sometimes may
be situated in a position such that the distance
between itself and an apparatus component on the
lower-course side thereof is shorter than the maximum
web roll radius of the paper web bobbin. In order to
avoid interference between the paper web on the bobbin
and the apparatus component, in this case, the bobbin 
is mounted on the upper-course bobbin mounting shaft
as long as its roll diameter is large enough.The paper web feeding apparatus further comprises
a pulling roller for holding the paper web, in
conjunction with a pinch roller, and a servomotor
coupled to the pulling roller. As the pulling roller
is rotated by means of the servomotor, the paper web
is delivered from the paper web bobbin at a speed
matched to the cigarette rod forming speed of the
winder, and is fed to the winder.When the remainder of the paper web on the bobbin
mounted on the upper-course bobbin mounting shaft is
reduced with the advance of the paper web supply, the
rotational speed of the servomotor is increased so
that the paper web is delivered from the bobbin at a
speed higher than the cigarette rod forming speed.
When the paper web is stored in a reservoir box of the
feeding apparatus, as a result of this operation, the
bobbin, having the reduced remaining web thereon, is
removed from the upper-course bobbin mounting shaft,
and is set on the lower-course mounting shaft.
Furthermore, a virgin paper web bobbin is set on the
upper-course bobbin mounting shaft, and the starting
end of a paper web on this bobbin is
