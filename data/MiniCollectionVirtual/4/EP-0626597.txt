<ABSTRACT>
A mirror (20) for reflecting a selected frequency of light includes a 
plurality of 

alternating quarter wavelength thick layers (44,46) of two dielectric 
materials that are 

resistive to physical and chemical changes upon exposure to ultraviolet 
radiation 

coated upon a substrate (40). The materials have different refractive 
indices. The 

materials preferably are comprised of a mixture of alumina and tantala 
as the high 

refractive index layer and alumina as the low refractive index layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical coatings for controlling the
reflection and transmission of particular optical wavelengths at an optical surface.
This invention relates particularly to optical coatings for ring laser gyroscope
mirrors. Still more particularly, this invention relates to optical coatings that provide
resistance to degradation of mirror surfaces under exposure to ultraviolet
wavelengths in a ring laser gyroscope.A ring laser gyroscope employs the Sagnac effect to measure rotation.
Counterpropagating light beams in a closed path have transit times that differ in
direct proportion to the rotation rate about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the
path. In a ring laser gyroscope the closed path is defined by mirrors that direct the
light beams around the path. The path is generally either square or triangular in
shape, although any closed polygonal path could, in principle, be used. The closed
path is typically in a cavity formed in a frame or body that is formed of a glass
ceramic material.The cavity is evacuated and then filled with a mixture of helium and neon,
which is the gain medium for the laser. An electrical discharge excites the gain
medium, which produces light amplification and a coherent light source. The
mirrors must be precisely aligned to direct the light beams around the closed path in
a manner that promotes proper operation of the laser. The mirror surface must be
free of impurities to provide a laser beam intensity that will result in a usable signal.Once laser oscillation occurs in the system at resonant frequencies, the
difference in the length of the pathways traversed by the counterpropagating laser
beams results in a difference or beat frequency which is sensed by a photodetector
and amplified by an amplifier. The beat frequency is a result of optically
heterodyning the counter propagating beams.In almost all lasers there is a decrease in useful laser power output over the
operating life of the laser. This decrease in useful power is accentuated by losses at
optical elements. With lasers that lase at relatively low gain a decrease in useful
power can become very significant. With lasers that operate at high gain (such as 
lasers which lase at some visible light frequencies) losses from optical elements,
while undesirable, can often be tolerated during the operating life of the tube.
However, even with such high gain lasers, eliminating or minimizing such losses is
desirable. Eliminating or minimizing optical element losses can extend the useful
life of
