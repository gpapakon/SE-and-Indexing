<ABSTRACT>
A tracking filter has a tunable filter responsive to an 
input signal for producing a filtered output signal, a Hilbert 

transformer for producing an in-phase reference signal and a 
quadrature-phase reference signal from the filtered output 

signal, and a discriminator responsive to the input signal and 
the in-phase and quadrature-phase reference signals for producing 

a passband center frequency control signal and a passband width 
control signal for controlling the passband center frequency and 

the passband width of the tunable filter. The frequency 
discriminator performs complex demodulation of the input signal 

with the in-phase reference signals to produce respective in-phase 
and quadrature-phase baseband signals which are low-pass 

filtered. The quadrature-phase baseband signal is divided by the 
in-phase baseband signal. The quotient is integrated to produce 

the passband center frequency control signal. Preferably the 
baseband signals are also filtered by adjustable filters having 

passband center frequencies and passband widths controlled in 
response to the passband center frequency control signal and the 

passband width control signal, respectively. Preferably the 
tracking filter is a digital filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to digital signal
processing, and more particularly to signal processing for a
quartz angular-rate sensor or solid-state gyroscope.Angular-rate sensors are essential components of navigational
and inertial guidance systems of aircraft, spacecraft,
ships, and missiles. Traditionally, mechanical gyroscopes were
used for angular rate sensing. More recently, laser ring gyros
and vibrating quartz gyros have been developed that have
characteristics superior to mechanical gyroscopes.A particularly economical vibrating quartz gyro is made by
acid etching of a quartz wafer and has two pairs of parallel
tines in an "H" configuration. Such a quartz gyro is described,
for example, in Fersht et al. U.S. Patent 5,056,366 and Staudte
U.S. Patent Re 32,931. One pair of tines (the drive tines) is
driven by an oscillator so that the tines move toward each other
and away from each other. Rotational motion of the tines about
the central longitudinal axis of the "H" causes the vibration of
the drive tines to couple, by coriolis force, to the other pair
of tines (the pick-off tines). The coriolis force causes the
pick-up tines to vibrate in such a way that when one pick-off
tine moves in one traverse direction perpendicular to the plane
of the "H", the other pick-off tine moves in the opposite 
transverse direction perpendicular to the plane of the "H". The
force, which drives the pick-off tines, is proportional to the
cross-product of the angular rate of rotation Ω (e.g., radians
per second), and the linear velocity of the drive tines (e.g.,
meters per second). Metal film pads are plated onto the tines
for piezoelectric coupling to these vibrations of the tines. In
the electrical pick-off signal, the angular rate of rotation of
the quartz gyro about the longitudinal axis appears as double-sideband
suppressed-carrier (DSSC) modulation of input angular
rate; the carrier frequency is the frequency of oscillation of
the drive tines. Therefore, an angular-rate signal can be
recovered from the pick-off signal by a synchronous demodulator.Analog circuits have been used for exciting the quartz gyro
and for synchronous demodulation of the pick-off signal. Analog
circuits, however, are subject to voltage offsets and drift of
component values due to temperature variations and aging. These
problems are particularly troublesome due to peculiarities of the
quartz gyro that are not apparent from the simplified or "first
order" operating characteristics as described above. One problem
is related to
