<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention has a plurality of gripping devices (13, 14) which are arranged above a support bed (1) and which can be moved in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the support bed. A reinforcing mesh (2) arranged on the support bed (1) can in this way be gripped and moved. A bending-mandrel apparatus (15) is provided in the support bed (1) to hold fast and bend the reinforcing mesh (2). With this device it is possible to form reinforcing meshes into reinforcement cages in a fully automatic manner and with high precision.

<CLAIMS>
A device for the production of reinforcement cages 
from reinforcement bars with trasverse and longitudinal 

cables, comprising a supporting bench (1) for the 
reinforcement bar (2), a longitudinal beam (4) mounted 

at a distance above it with two travelling vehicles (5, 
6) thereupon, with, attached to the vehicles (5, 6), at 

least one column which can be lowered and/or raised (7, 
8) at the end of which at least one gripper (11-14) is 

fitted, and is provided with a bending block device 
(15) in the supporting bench (1), which is extendible 

and/or retractable from the supporting bench (1) up to 
the reinforcement bar (2). 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
bending block device (15) comprises several bending 

blocks, with each bending block provided with at least 
two different bending radii and at the same time 

functioning as a clamp. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein at 
least one vehicle (5, 6) is provided with two columns 

(7, 8), which can be raised and/or lowered 
independently of each other. 
A device as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the grippers (11-14) can be extended and/or 

retracted into/out of a housing (9, 10), which is in 
each case attached to the end of a column (7, 8). 
A device as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the grippers 
(12, 14) on one vehicle (6) travel horizontally in 

and/or out of their housing (10) and the grippers (11, 
13) on the other vehicle (5) travel in and/or out of 

their housing (9) at an angle of ideally 45Â° to the 

reinforcement bar plane.
