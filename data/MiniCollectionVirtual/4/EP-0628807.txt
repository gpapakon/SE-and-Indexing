<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the inspection
of glass bottles to identify flaws in the bottom of
the bottles. A diffused light source directs light
upwardly through the bottom of the bottle and a two
dimensional camera looks at the illuminated bottom
through the bottle mouth to see any defect.A glass bottle may have a wide disparity of
thicknesses in the base. A glass bottle may, for
example, have a heavy heel portion. As a result, the
camera will see varying light intensities and may not
see enough light in the heel region to see the
defects. To see these defects, the intensity of the
light must be increased but the intensity level of
the light passing through the thin portions may
present a dynamic brightness range (contrast ratio)
beyond the capabilities of the camera. This dynamic
brightness range can be reduced by matching the
spectral composition of the light to the spectral
absorption of the bottle glass by passing the light
through a colored filter matching the color of the
bottle.When spectral matching of the light source to
the bottle does not sufficiently reduce the contrast
ratio to fall within the dynamic brightness range of
the camera, spot or ring filters or special light sources designed for the
application may be applied to overlay the light
source to attenuate the light from the backlight
source in a pattern which corresponds to those areas
of the bottle which are transmitting too much light
and overloading the sensor in the corresponding image
regions (DE-A-3919110).Cormack et al.: "Optical inspection of manufactured glass
using adaptive Fourier filtering" in Optical Engineering,
vol. 27, no.5, May 1988 discloses a machine for inspecting the
bottom of a glass container. The bottom of the container is
illuminated through the opening of the container. The image
of the bottom is fourier filtered in real time by means of a
spatial modulator placed in the fourier plane, where the
diffraction pattern is projected, between two fourier transforming
lenses. At the same time a beamsplitter allows a camera
to also view the diffraction pattern. The camera image is
thresholded and then used to drive the spatial modulator,
displaying the appropriate inverse filter function for each
container. A film is used to record the output of the inspection system.It is accordingly an object of the present
invention to provide an improved device for attenuating 
the light from the backlight source to reduce the
contrast ratio.The invention generally comprises a machine for
inspecting the bottom of a glass
