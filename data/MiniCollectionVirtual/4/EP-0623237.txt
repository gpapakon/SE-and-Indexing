<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device for 
remote sensing of objects. Within trade and industry the 
interest in non-optical and non-contact sensing of objects 
have increased lately. In stores and superstores it is 
interesting to read price labels and similar elements, and 
within the industry it is desirable to read identification 
labels in industrial material flows. A plurality of non-optical 
and non-contact principles of identification of 
labels are used at present. Most common is perhaps antitheft 
labels in shops. In a commonly used embodiment in trading labels are 
used which are provided with a resonant circuit comprising 
a capacitive and an inductive element. Said resonant 
circuit can be forced to resonance by applying an 
electromagnetic signal having a defined energy content at 
the resonant frequency to said label in an interrogation 
zone normally provided at the exit of the shop. A detection 
device detecting signals from said resonant circuit at the 
resonant frequency produces an alarm if a label provided 
with an "activated" resonant circuit enters into said 
interrogation zone. A practical embodiment of a resonant 
circuit intended for this purpose is disclosed in US,A,4 
578 654. A complete system includes also a device for 
"deactivating" said label which is done on payment of the 
merchandise to which the label is attached. A problem of all previously known labels used for the 
purpose of limiting pilferage is a lack of ability of 
individually identifying each label when a plurality of 
labels are present simultaneously in said interrogation 
zone. For the purpose mentioned the problem is not relevant 
because an alarm should be delivered if a single label 
or a plurality of labels having an "activated" resonant 
circuit enter into said interrogation zone and are 
detected.  
 The method according to the present invention is 
based on the fact that certain magnetic and mechanical 
properties of elements shaped as tapes, wires or strips of 
amorphous materials are changed when the elements are 
exposed to a magnetic field, a so called bias field. The 
position/direction of an element is for instance related to 
the magnetic field in the longitudinal or axial direction 
of the amorphous element, and the mechanical resonant 
frequency of the element is a measure of the position/direction 
of the element. Corresponding conditions apply 
for a component comprising an amorphous element which is 
magnetically coupled to an inductive element in turn 
included in an
