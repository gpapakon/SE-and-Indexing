<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the compounds 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-24-oxo-cholecalciferol 
and 1,24,25-trihydroxy-16-ene-cholecalciferol which stimulate 

differentiation of HL-60 cells, rendering them useful as an agent for the 
treatment of neoplastic diseases such as leukemia, and also decrease 

proliferation of human keratinocytes, rendering them useful as an agent for 
the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders of the skin such as psoriasis. 
They are prepared by perfusing 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-cholecalciferol 
in rate kidneys, extracting the perfusate and isolating 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-24-oxo-cholecalciferol 

and 1,24,25-trihydroxy-16-ene-cholecalciferol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the compounds 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-24-oxo-cholecalciferol
and 1,24,25-trihydroxy-16-ene-cholecalciferol, which can be
further characterized by the formula

   wherein W is O or (H,OH).They are useful as agents for the treatment of neoplastic diseases, for
the treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases, and for the treatment of
sebaceous gland diseases.The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions
comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier, and to the use of a compound of formula I for
the manufacture of a medicament for stimulating differentiation of HL-60
cells or for decreasing proliferation of human keratinocytes.The compounds of formula I (hereinafter also 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-24-oxo-D3
and 1,24,25(OH)3-16-ene-D3) are metabolites of 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-cholecalciferol
(hereinafter, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3). They can be prepared by
perfusing 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-D3 in rat kidneys, extracting the perfusate and
isolating the compounds of formula I. It was surprisingly found that 
1,25(OH)2-16-ene-24-oxo-D3 and 1,24,25(OH)3-dihydroxy-16-ene-D3 resisted
further hydroxylation from other hydroxylase enzymes.The compounds of formula I stimulate differentiation of HL-60 cells
which renders the compounds useful as agents for the treatment of
neoplastic diseases, e.g. leukemia. They also decrease proliferation of
human keratinocytes, which renders the compounds useful as agent for the
treatment of hyperproliferative skin disorders, e.g. psoriasis, basal cell
carcinomas, disorders of keratinization, and keratosis.The compounds of formula I can be administered topically, for the
treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis, basal cell
carcinomas, disorders of keratinization, and keratosis, to hosts in need of
such treatment, e.g. at a dose in the range of 1 to 1000 µg per gram of topical
formulation. The compounds of formula I can be administered orally, for the
treatment of neoplastic diseases such as leukemia, and for the treatment of
hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis, basal cell carcinomas,
disorders of keratinization, and keratosis, to hosts in need of such treatment,
e.g. at a dose in the range of 0.1 to 10 µg per day.The activity of 1,25(OH)2-24-oxo-16-ene-D3 as a compound that induces
differentiation of human promyelocytic cells, rendering the compound
useful for the treatment of neoplastic diseases is demonstrated by the
following test procedures which are known in the art.a)
