<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst carrier body 10 for cleaning an exhaust 
gas includes two elongated metal foil sheets 11 each 

including some areas. These areas extend substantially 
in parallel with the length direction, and one of them 

provides a corrugated portion 12 and the other of them 
provides a flat portion 13. The elongated metal foil 

sheets 11 are stacked, rolled together and brazed such 
that the corrugated portion 12 of one of the foil sheet 

is opposed and contacts the flat portion 13 of the other 
of the foil sheets, thus making a rolled honeycomb 

structure to be used under an environment exposed to a 
hot exhaust gas and to heat generated by catalytic 

reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst 
carrier body for use in an exhaust gas cleaning system or 
apparatus. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
catalyst carrier body used in a catalytic converter to 
clean an exhaust gas from an automobile engine or the 
like as a catalyst holding body to which particles of a 
catalyst are deposited. Figs. 7A to 7C are perspective views of an 
existing catalyst carrier body 1 typically used in 
existing exhaust gas cleaning systems and known from JP-A-1274845. The catalyst 
carrier body 1 typically includes a corrugated metal 
sheet 2 as shown in Fig. 7A and one or two flat metal 
sheets 3 as shown in Fig. 7B which are alternatingly 
staked, rolled and brazed together such that the catalyst 
carrier body, as a whole, exhibits a multi-rolled 
configuration to make a honeycomb structure in which cell 
walls are defined by the corrugated sheet 2 and the flat 
sheets 3. In Fig. 7C, numeral 4 designates each cell, 
and 5 denotes an outer cylinder of the catalyst carrier 
body 1. Figs. 8A to 8C are also provided to explain the 
same existing carrier body 1, in which Figs. 8A and 8B 
are a side elevation and a front elevation of a forming 
roller 7 for shaping a flat plate 6 into the corrugated 
sheet 2, and Fig. 8C is a plan view of a combination of  
 
the corrugated sheet 2 and the flat sheet 3. In Fig. 8C, 
numeral 8 denotes an outermost portion of the flat sheet 
3 to be bonded to the outer cylinder 5, and 9 designates 
a brazing filler metal. The catalyst carrier body 1 
fabricated in this manner is typically used, for example, 
in an automobile engine to introduce therein a hot 
exhaust gas from the engine such that particles of the 
catalyst deposited to the carrier body react on harmful 
substances contained in the exhaust gas to clean the gas. The existing catalyst carrier body 1, however, 
involves various problems discussed below. First, the corrugates sheet 2 and the flat sheet 3 
are different in thermal expansion rate when exposed to 
severe heat while a hot exhaust gas passes through and 
heat is generated by catalytic reaction. More specifically, 
since the corrugated sheet 2, made by folding the 
flat plate 6 in the form of continuous waves, is different 
in thermal expansion rate from the flat sheet 3 
having the original form of the flat plate 6, due to the 
difference in shape therebetween, the corrugated sheet 2 
has a much larger expansion rate than the flat sheet 3 
and much more expansive. The existing catalyst carrier 
body 1,
