<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for a stores crane 
for internal materials handling comprising a load carrier 

(16) so arranged as to run along guides (22) on a vertical 
crane mast (12) and a lifting device (18) for the load 

carrier arranged for displacement of the load carrier along 
the mast. A fall brake (26) is attached to the load carrier 

for the purpose, in the event of a fault in the lifting 
device, of preventing the load carrier from falling downwards 

through engagement with the guides. A detector device (27) is 
so arranged as to sense the movement of the load carrier and, 

in the event of deviation from set values, to actuate the 
fall brake. This exhibits a brake housing (30) with a moving 

wedge-shaped brake body (33) capable of moving against one of 
the guides (22) and along a support surface (45) angled 

against the guide in the brake housing (30). The movement is 
controlled so as to take place between a first, non-braking 

position and a second, braking position in which the brake 
body (13) is in contact under the effect of the wedge with 

both the guide (22) and the support surface (45). The brake 
body (33) incorporates a scraper device (52) so arranged, on 

the one hand, as to scrape the guide (22) clean from dirt 
and, on the other hand, as to displace the brake body (33) 

towards its braking position through an initial frictional 
force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stores crane for internal 
materials handling comprising a load carrier so arranged as 
to run along guides on a vertical crane mast, a lifting 
device arranged for displacement of the load carrier along 
the mast, a fall brake attached to the load carrier for the 
purpose, in the event of a fault in the lifting device, of 
preventing the load carrier from falling downwards through 
engagement with the guides, and a detector device so arranged 
as to sense the movement of the load carrier and, in the 
event of deviation from set values, as to actuate the fall 
brake, which exhibits a brake housing with a moving wedge-shaped 
brake body capable of moving against one of the guides 
and along a support surface angled against the guide in the 
brake housing between a first, non-braking position and a 
second, braking position in which the brake body is in 
contact with the guide and the aforementioned support 
surface. Stores cranes of the aforementioned kind are used for the 
transport of loads in various storage buildings. The cranes 
are normally fully automatic in operation, but can also be 
equipped for manual operation, usually from a cab on the load 
carrier. Servicing and maintenance are also carried out 
manually on the mast and load carrier. Lifting heights of 30-40 
m can be encountered, for which reason special safety 
systems must be provided to arrest the load carrier in the 
event of a fault occurring in the vertical lifting devices, 
for example overspeeding of the lift motor, slipping power 
transmission or cable fracture. The safety systems comprise, 
on the one hand, a detection arrangement for sensing the rate 
of descent and, on the other hand, a fall brake for arresting 
the load carrier. All the components must be capable of 
operating independently of the normal energy supply to the 
crane, which means that an entirely separate sensing and 
braking system must be arranged on the crane.  Previously disclosed stores cranes normally have a detector 
device in the form of an endless chain or cable, which is 
attached to the load carrier and runs around guide pulleys at 
the top and at the foot of the mast. The chain is so arranged 
as to drive some form of speed-dependent locking wheel, for 
example of the kind which incorporates balanced weights which 
are thrown outwards and lock a rotating unit once a certain 
speed of rotation has been reached. The rotating unit then 
causes a mechanical brake to engage via rods, cables or the 
like. One example of

Arrangement for a stores crane for internal materials 
handling comprising a load carrier (16) so arranged as 

to run along guides (22) on a vertical crane mast (12), 
a lifting device (18) arranged for displacement of the 

load carrier (16) along the mast (12), a fall brake (26) 
attached to the load carrier (16) for the purpose, in 

the event of a fault in the lifting device, of 
preventing the load carrier (16) from falling downwards 

through engagement with the guides, and a detector 
device (27) so arranged as to sense the movement of the 

load carrier (16) and, in the event of deviation from 
set values, as to actuate the fall brake (26), which 

exhibits a brake housing (30) with a moving wedge-shaped 
brake body (33) capable of moving against one of the 

guides (22) and along a support surface (45) angled 
against the guide (22) in the brake housing (30) between 

a first, non-braking position and a second, braking 
position in which the brake body (33) is in contact with 

the guide (22) and the aforementioned support surface 
(45), characterized in that the brake body (33) 

comprises a scraper device (52) arranged in a direction 
across the direction of movement of the brake body (33) 

and capable of movement relative to it, so arranged as 
to make contact with and scrape against the guide (22) 

when the brake is actuated. 
Arrangement in accordance with Patent Claim 1, 
characterized in that the brake body (33) exhibits a 

sliding surface (44) and a braking surface (43), in 
conjunction with which the sliding surface is so 

arranged as to make contact with the supporting surface 
(45) inside the brake housing during movement of the 

brake body, whereas the braking surface is arranged 
parallel with the guide (22), so that this surface is 

displaced in a parallel sense towards or away from the 
guide in conjunction with movement of the brake body. 
Arrangement in accordance with Patent Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a spring device (54) is so 

arranged as to exert a constant influence on the brake 
body (33) in a sense essentially parallel with the brake 

surface (43), with a spring force for causing the latter 
to be displaced into the braking position, and in that 

a hydraulic cylinder (57) is so arranged as to 
counteract the spring effect of the spring device (54) 

via a pressurized operating chamber (59), and in that a 
valve (60) connected to the detector device (27) is so 

arranged as to reduce the pressure on actuation of the 
brake so that the spring force is able to force the 

brake body (33) into its braking position.

Arrangement in accordance with Patent Claim 6, 
characterized in that the detector device (27) comprises 

a generator (64) so arranged as to be driven by the 
aforementioned wheel (63), and in that the generated 

voltage controls a switching device (65, 66) for the

opening of the valve (60) leading to the pressurized 
operating chamber (59) and reducing its pressure so that 

the fall brake is actuated.
