<ABSTRACT>
A terminal for processing a shielding wire (50) end, 
and more particularly a terminal for connecting a drain wire 

(51) (for grounding) of the shielding wire to a grounding 
wire (60) member us disclosed. 
A plurality of terminals each comprising a terminal 
body, a pair of press-contact members (11, 12) formed by 

inwardly bending opposite sides of the body and a tongue 
(13) projecting from a center of the body are fixed on a 

film-shaped carrier (20) with the press-contact members of 
the respective terminals being aligned in a line at a 

constant pitch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly of terminals for processing a shielding wire end and a carrier film,
the terminals being particularly but not exclusively suitable for connecting a drain wire (for
grounding) of the shielding wire to a grounding wire member. The term "processing" is
intended to cover terms such as "terminating" or "connecting".In a known terminal for processing a shielding wire end, a plurality of terminals
serially and integrally formed through respective joints are cut off at the respective joints,
the respective terminals are placed on an adhesive tape, and the tape having the terminals
mounted thereon is wound on a reel. (It is wound on the reel to allow handling by a
pressing machine).However, in such a prior art terminal for processing the shielding wire end, the
terminals mounted on the adhesive tape may be inclined or moved while they are
transported with the tape, and certain terminals are hard to adhere to the tape, and burrs of
the cut-off joints may damage the tape.A terminal of this type is described in our patent specification US-A-4051323, the
terminal having a terminal body, a pair of press-contact members extending inwardly from
opposite sides of said body, and a tongue projecting from a centre of the body. US-A-405
1323 contemplates use of excess film as a carrier strip for continuous strip use, but does
not address problems of strip flexibility or damage due to flexure.According to the invention, there is provided an assembly of terminals for
processing a shielding wire end and a carrier film, each of said terminals comprising a terminal body, a pair of press-contact
members extending inwardly from opposite sides of said body and a tongue projecting
from a centre of said body, the terminals being fixed to the carrier film with the press-contact
members of the respective terminals being aligned in a line at a constant pitch, the
carrier film having a pair of opposed U-shaped cut-outs lying between each adjacent pair
of terminals. By way of example, one embodiment of
an assembly of terminals according to the invention, will
now be described with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 shows a side view of a terminal forming part of the
present invention,Figure 2 shows a plan view of the terminal for
processing a shielding wire end,Figure 3 shows the terminals for processing the
shielding wire ends of Figure 2 wound on a reel,Figure 4 shows terminals for processing the shielding
wire ends of Figure 2 wound on a reel, andFigure 5 illustrates

<CLAIMS>
An assembly of terminals for processing a shielding wire end and a carrier film
20), each terminal comprising a terminal body (10), a pair of press-contact members (11, 12) extending

inwardly from opposite sides of said body and a tongue (13) projecting from a
centre of said body, the terminals being fixed to the carrier film (20) with the press-contact

members of the respective terminals being aligned in a line at a constant
pitch, 
characterized in that
 the carrier film (2) has a pair of opposed U-shaped cut-outs lying between
each adjacent pair of terminals.
An assembly as claimed in Claim 1 wherein an outer side of each
terminal body, outer sides of said press-contact members and a portion of inner

sides of said press-contact members are covered with said carrier film (20).
An assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein said tongue (13) is
bent in the same direction as the bending direction of one said pair of press-contact

members.
An assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the body of each
terminal comprises a planar terminal base portion (10), the press-contact members

(11, 12) extending from opposing edges and out of the plane of the base on the
same side thereof, the tongue (13) being suitable for supporting a shieldin
g wire and
for connecting a shielding of the shielded wire to another conductor

on the other side of the tongue from the shielded wire, the press-contact
members (11, 12) being suitable for being pressed over the shielded conductor and the or each

other conductor to achieve a desired electrical connection. 
An assembly as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the press-contact members are curved
with mutually facing concave surfaces, the tongue being curved in the same direction as

one of the press contact members (11, 12).
