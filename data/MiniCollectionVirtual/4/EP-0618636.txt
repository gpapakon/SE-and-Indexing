<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-layer circulator
used in a microwave band radio device, for example in a mobile
communication device such as a portable telephone.A conventional lumped element type circulator has an
assembled circulator element with a circular plane shape and a
basic structure as shown in an exploded oblique view of Fig. 1.
In the figure, a reference numeral 10 denotes a circular
substrate made of a non-magnetic material such as a glass-reinforced
epoxy. Coil conductors (inner conductors) 11 and 12
are formed on top and bottom surfaces of the non-magnetic
material substrate 10, respectively. These coil conductors 11
and 12 are electrically connected with each other by via holes
13 passing through the substrate 10. Circularly shaped members
14 and 15 made of a ferromagnetic material are attached to the
both surfaces of the non-magnetic material substrate 10 having
the coil conductors 11 and 12 so that rotating RF (Radio
Frequency) magnetic fluxes are induced in these ferromagnetic
members 14 and 15 due to an RF power applied to the coil 
conductors 11 and 12. As aforementioned, the conventional
circulator element in the circulator has a circular plane shape
and is constructed by assembling, namely piling and bonding,
the ferromagnetic members 14 and 15 on the both sides of the
non-magnetic material substrate 10.The circulator is then constructed, as shown in its
exploded oblique view of Fig. 2, by stacking and fixing in
sequence grounding conductor electrodes 16 and 17, exiting
permanent magnets 18 and 19 and a metal housing separated to
upper and lower parts 20 and 21 on the both ferromagnetic
members 14 and 15, respectively. The housing parts 20 and 21
form a magnetic path of the magnetic flux from and to the
exiting permanent magnets 18 and 19.If an RF power is applied to the coil conductors 11 and 12
through input/output terminals not shown, RF magnetic flux
rotating around the coil conductors 11 and 12 will be produced
in the ferromagnetic members 14 and 15. Under this state, if a
dc magnetic field perpendicular to the RF magnetic flux is
applied from the permanent magnets 18 and 19, the ferromagnetic
members 14 and 15 present different permeability µ + and µ -
depending upon rotating sense of the RF magnetic flux, as shown
in Fig. 3. A circulator utilizes this difference of the
permeability depending upon the rotating sense. Namely, a
propagation velocity of the RF signal in the circulator element
will differ in accordance with the rotating sense and thus the 
signals
