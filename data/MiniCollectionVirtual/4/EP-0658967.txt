A magnetic centrifugal pump for aggressive media 
comprising a separating can (11), between an outer 

rotor which is equipped with permanent magnets (24) and 
which is connected to a drive motor, and 


an inner rotor which is equipped with permanent 
magnets (22) and which is connected to an impeller 

(10), 
the separating can (11) being made from a fibre 
composite, 
 
characterised by
 
a coating of modified amorphous carbon which is applied 

to the fibre composite by ion bombardment. 
A magnetic centrifugal pump according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the separating can consists of 

carbon fibre reinforced plastic. 
A magnetic centrifugal pump according to any one 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

carbon coating has a hydrogen content of about 20 to 30 
atom-percent. 
A magnetic centrifugal pump according to any one 
of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 

amorphous coating applied has a thickness of more than 
10 µm.  

 
A method of coating the separating can of a 
magnetic centrifugal pump according to any one of the 

preceding claims, characterised by the following steps: 

introduction of the separating can (11) open at 
one end, into a hermetically sealable chamber, the 

separating can being fitted with its open end at 
the top on to a conductive sample plate insulated 

from the chamber, 
evacuating the chamber with a vacuum pump system, 
introduction of a hydrocarbon-containing gas 
mixture with simultaneous further emptying of the 

chamber, an initial pressure of about 10
-5
 mbar 
being achieved by the evacuation, and a pressure 

of about 10
-3
 - 1 mbar then being maintained by 
increased introduction of the gas, 
subjecting the conductive plate on which the 
separating can (11) is located to a strong highfrequency 

signal, the high frequency being 
controlled in the range from about 2 to 30 MHz and 
controlling the temperature of the chamber 
throughout the coating operation to a constant 

temperature of 100 - 120°C.
