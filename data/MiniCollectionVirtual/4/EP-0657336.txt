<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible and expandable void filler (20) for 
supporting and restraining cargo during transit in trucks, 

railroad cars and airplanes includes an outer tubular 
housing (22) having a diamond shaped tubular core (24). The 

housing (22) and core (24) are collapsible into a generally 
flat configuration along score indentations (36, 56). In 

one embodiment, the void filler is held in an expanded 
configuration by a plurality of collapsible wall portions 

(58) along the outer housing (22) that collapse inwardly 
from the periphery of the housing and engage the core (24). 

In another embodiment (Figures 5 and 8), the void filler 
is held in an expanded configuration by a cord or 

elastomeric bands (74) which are tightly stretched around 
the periphery of the housing and is held in a series of 

aligned notches (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to a void filler
which is used to fill empty spaces in a cargo area of a
truck, railroad car, airplane and the like so as to prevent
damage to cargo that may be caused by the cargo shifting
during transit. More specifically, this disclosure shows
a void filler which may be expanded into a rigid
configuration for use in filling spaces and collapsed into
a generally flat configuration for storage.Prior art void fillers, such as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,494,897 to Rogers and B1 4,494,897 to Rogers,
utilize a void filler which may be expanded for use in
filling spaces and collapsed into a generally flat
configuration for storage. The void filler disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,494,897 to Rogers and B1 4,494,897 to
Rogers includes an outer tubular housing and an inner
diamond-shaped core. The housing and the core readily
collapse about integrally formed score indentations. To
use the void filler, the outer housing is compressed about
the score indentations thereby expanding the housing walls
and the core. The void filler is placed between pieces of
cargo and prevents the cargo from damaging each other due
to shifting during transit.While this type of void filler effectively prevents
damage to cargo, the void filler cannot maintain an
expanded configuration without cargo being placed along its
sides since it readily collapses about the score
indentations. Thus, a single operator cannot easily place
the void filler between pieces of cargo since it does not
maintain an expanded configuration and readily collapses.The present invention is intended to overcome or
minimize all of these problems, as well as to present
several other improvements.According to this invention, a collapsible void
filler device foldable into a flat, collapsed
configuration for storage and unfoldable into an expanded 
configuration for preventing damage to cargo during
transit, comprising:
an outer housing comprising a four sided, generally
tubular member having a bottom wall, a top wall, and two
side walls, and a longitudinal axis extending the length
thereof;said side walls of said outer housing tubular member
extending upwardly from said bottom wall of said outer
housing tubular member to said top wall of said outer
housing tubular member when said void filler is disposed in
said expanded configuration, said side walls of said outer
housing tubular member including means urging said side
walls of said outer housing tubular member outwardly so as
to collapse said outer housing tubular member

bottom wall (42) and said top wall (44) of said inner core
member (24), said inner core member having a width which

extends across a majority of the length of said outer
housing member (22), and a length which is sized so as to

contact and space apart said side walls (30) of said outer
housing tubular member (22) so as to prevent inward

movement of said side walls (30) of said outer housing
tubular member and thereby rigidify said outer housing
