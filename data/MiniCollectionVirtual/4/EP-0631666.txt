<CLAIMS>
Method of determining the concentration of 
elements during electron beam melting by exploitation 

of the characteristic X-radiation of the elements 
contained in the melt, said radiation being detected by 

an X-ray spectrometer, 
characterised in that
 at certain 
preset intervals of time, special measuring phases are 

integrated into the melting process, the melting 
process being modified during the measuring phase of 

the melting regime in such a way that on the surface 
of the melting bath a chosen area receives the full 

impact of the electron beam and the determination of 
concentration based on X-ray analysis is carried out 

during this time. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
during the measuring phase the accelerating voltage 

and/or capacity and/or beam deflection are altered. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 the measuring phases are 
integrated into the
 melting process by means of known 
electronic controls.
