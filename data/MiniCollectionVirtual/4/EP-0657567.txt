<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of and an apparatus 
for heat-treating a yarn continuously twisted while the yarn is 
traveling along a yarn traveling path to heat-set the twist of the 
yarn on the traveling path, and in particular to a process of and 
an apparatus for heat-treating a twisted yarn, such as for instance 
a hard twist yarn, made of polyethylene terephthalate to heat-set 
the twist of the yarn. In general, a woven fabric requires a yarn imparted many 
turns of twist for the purpose of making the yarn excellent in feeling 
when it is made into the fabric. For preventing snarls (kinky 
thread) from being generated in the looming process of the yarn 
resulting from many turns of twist, for example more than 600 turns 
per meter imparted to the yarn, it is necessary for the twisted yarn 
to be heat-treated until residual torque remaining in the twist of the 
yarn is partly removed to a torque (residual torque level) causing 
no trouble to the twisted yarn in the looming process. As this kind of yarn twist setting process there has been 
generally employed a steam box process which comprises the steps of 
winding the twisted yarn on a flanged bobbin and the like having a 
number of bores, accommodating the flanged bobbin with the twisted 
yarn in a steam box, filling the steam box with steam of the temperature 
of 60 - 80 °C after gas in the steam box being expelled and 
vacuumized, and leaving the flanged bobbin with the twisted yarn in 
the steam box for a time interval of 30 to 60 minutes to heat-set the 
twist of the yarn. As a process tentatively carried out for heat-setting the twist  
 
of the yarn, there has recently been well known in the art a process 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 60-162821, 
which is called "continuation process" (dry type). The 
continuation process comprises the steps of continuously traveling 
the twisted yarn, and heating the traveling twisted yarn with a dry 
heater of the contact or non-contact type for heat-setting the twist 
of the yarn. The steam box process, however, has encountered the following 
problems. (A1) There has been caused difference in the set twist of 
the yarn between the core and surface portions of the yarn package 
on the flanged bobbin. Such a yarn different in the set twist tends 
to cause so-called "uneven luster" in the fabric made of the yarn, 
thereby resulting in unacceptable products. (A2) In order to reduce 
the difference in the set twist of the yarn between the core and 
surface portions of
