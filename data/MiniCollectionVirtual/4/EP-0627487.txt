<ABSTRACT>
Ligands for flt3 receptors capable of transducing self-renewal signals to regulate 
the growth, proliferation or differentiation of progenitor cells and stem cells are 

disclosed. The invention is directed to flt3-L as an isolated protein, the DNA encoding 
the flt3-L, host cells transfected with cDNAs encoding flt3-L, compositions comprising 

flt3-L, methods of improving gene transfer to a mammal using flt3-L, and methods of 
improving transplantations using flt3-L. Flt3-L finds use in treating patients with 

anemia, AIDS and various cancers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mammalian flt3-ligands, the nucleic acids
encoding such ligands, processes for production of recombinant flt3-ligands,
pharmaceutical compositions containing such ligands, and their use in various
therapies.Blood cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells that become committed to
differentiate along certain lineages, i.e., erythroid, megakaryocytic, granulocytic,
monocytic, and lymphocytic. Cytokines that stimulate the proliferation and maturation
of cell precursors are called colony stimulating factors ("CSFs"). Several CSFs are
produced by T-lymphocytes including interleukin-3 ("IL-3"), granulocyte-monocyte
CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), and monocyte CSF (M-CSF). These
CSFs affect both mature cells and stem cells. Heretofore no factors have been
discovered that are able to predominantly affect stem cells.Tyrosine kinase receptors ("TKRs") are growth factor receptors that regulate the
proliferation and differentiation of a number of cells (Yarden, Y. & Ullrich, A. Annu.
Rev. Biochem., 57, 443-478, 1988: and Cadena, D.L. & Gill, G.N. FASEB J., 6,
2332-2337, 1992). Certain TKRs function within the hematopoietic system. For 
example, signaling through the colony-stimulating factor type 1 ("CSF-1"), receptor c-fms
regulates the survival, growth and differentiation of monocytes (Stanley et al., J.
Cell Biochem., 21, 151-159, 1983). Steel factor ("SF", also known as mast cell
growth factor, stem cell factor or kit ligand), acting through c-kit, stimulates the
proliferation of cells in both myeloid and lymphoid compartments.Flt3 (Rosnet et al. Oncogene, 6, 1641-1650, 1991) and flk-2 (Matthews et al.,
Cell, 65, 1143-1152, 1991) are variant forms of a TKR that is related to the c-fms and
c-kit receptors. The flk-2 gene product is expressed on hematopoietic and progenitor
cells, while the flt3 gene product has a more general tissue distribution. The flt3 and
flk-2 receptor proteins are similar in amino acid sequence and vary at two amino acid
residues in the extracellular domain and diverge in a 31 amino acid segment located near
the C-termini (Lyman et al., Oncogene, 8, 815-822, 1993).Lyman et al, Cell 75, 1157-1167 (17 December 1993) reports the molecular
cloning of a ligand for the flt3/flk-2 tyrosine kinase receptor. WO 94/26891
published 24 November 1994 is said to describe mammalian flt3 ligands and
fragments thereof.Flt3-ligand ("flt3-L") has been found to regulate the growth and differentiation
of progenitor and stem cells and is likely to possess clinical
