<ABSTRACT>
A switched receptacle (10) includes a latching 
relay KO selectively providing power to an outlet 

receptacle (12). A drive circuit (26) for the latching 
relay KO provides indirect feedback to a logic controller 

(20) which follows or tracks each relay operation to ensure 
that the relay is in the commanded mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a switched power receptacle.A driver dircuit for a bistable relay is known from EP-A-0
050 301 having features similar to features b) to f) of
claim 1. The relay outlet contact is not included in an
outlet receptacle. The input terminals of the driver circuit
are controlled directly (no command circuit shown) . A flip-flop
is included in the circuit, yet not used as a memory.In providing electrical circuits to a facility, such as
a home, one or more branch circuits are wired to distribute
electrical power to load devices, such as light fixtures or
outlet receptacles. Typically, the receptacle or fixture is
hardwired directly to the branch circuit, with power to the
device being turned on or off at the device itself. For
example, a light fixture might include a pull cord for
actuating a switch, while a small appliance might include a
power switch.With recent technological development it is both
possible and advantageous to provide automated control of
load devices to provide, for example, remote or timed
switching. One such system directs all communication
functions into a master system controller. This gives a
homeowner flexible communication and power control from
anywhere in the home there is a control panel or switch, or
even anywhere there is a telephone, such as the car or
office. An intelligent outlet receptacle or fixture block
allows individual appliances or fixtures to be separately
and automatically controlled as necessary or desired. To do
so, some means must be provided for controlling switching of
power to the load device. To be practical, the switching
must be done inexpensively and accurately. A latching relay
has been found to be readily adaptable to such an
application. A latching relay is latched when connected to a
positive polarity voltage source and unlatched when
connected to a negative polarity voltage 
source.A relay of the remnant latching type is
permanently magnetized so that upon actuation by a
relatively high current pulse of positive polarity an
included plunger is magnetically retained in an actuated
position. When a reverse polarity power source is
connected the magnetic field is reduced so that a spring
force returns the plunger to an unlatched position. A
short duration pulse must be used to avoid over-magnetisation
with opposite magnetic polarity.Because only a short duration pulse is used for
latching and unlatching, it is important to ensure that the
relay actually does change state when commanded to do so.
Desirably, a feedback circuit is

A switched power receptacle (10) comprising:

a) a power source (18) developing a voltage at a select
potential;
b) a latching relay (KO) having a relay coil (30) and an
electrical contact (32) switched by said relay coil, said

relay coil (30) being latched when connected to a positive
polarity voltage source and unlatched when connected to a

negative polarity voltage source;
c) an outlet receptacle (12) connected in series with
said contact (32) to said power source (18);
d) a command circuit (20) developing a command signal,
said command signal assuming a first state to latch said

polarity voltage when said command signal assumes said first

state and to supply a negative polarity voltage when said
command signal assumes said second state,
g) a memory circuit (U3A) included in said drive circuit
(26) for storing a digital value representing if the voltage

most recently supplied to said relay coil (30) was of
positive polarity or negative polarity, said digital value

being transferred to said command circuit (20) to ensure
that the relay coil (30) is in its desired state.
