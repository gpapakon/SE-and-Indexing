<ABSTRACT>
Assembly device with improved tamper proofing for a tap which closes after a time delay including a body (1) made as a single part, into which is fitted a cartridge (3) which groups together all the elements necessary for operation, characterised in that the body has, at its upper part, a skirt including a slide (10) which has a hole (9) the axis of which can coincide with that of the member (8 or 19) for fastening the push button (5) onto the end of the valve stem (4), the said hole normally being concealed by the upper part of the body (1) when the tap is being used.

Reinforced inviolability assembly device for a slow release closing valve
comprising a body (1) made up of a single piece in which a cartridge (3) is fixed

grouping all the elements required for functioning, namely : the valve seat, the clack
valve, the clack valve rod (4), the dwell time mechanism and a push-button (5) secured

to the free extremity of said clack valve rod (4) with the aid of a fixing element (8 or
19), characterised in that the body (1) has at its upper portion a skirt comprising a slide

(10) having a hole (9) whose axis is able to coincide with that of the fixing element (8
or 19) of the push-button (5) on the extremity of the clack valve rod (4), said hole (9)

normally being masked by the upper portion of the body (1) when the valve is used.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the slide (10) can be moved
along a direction parallel to the axis (XY) of the valve.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the slide (10) is borne
by a ring (12) rendered axially immobilised and in rotation with respect to the body (1),

the upper extremity of said ring being covered by the lower edge of the push-button.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the ring (12) has a radial
finger (14) engaged in a longitudinal groove (15) of the hub (6) of the push-button.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the fixing
element (19)is able to penetrate when rotating around its axis (ZW) into a throat (16) of

the rod (4) and take support under the formed shoulder (17) so as to apply the bottom of
the housing (7) provided in the hub (6) of the push-button against the extremity of said

rod (4) with the insertion of an elastically deformable element (18).
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the fixing element (19) is
formed of a cylinder having a cam (20) at its extremity which, at the time of rotation of

said element, is able to penetrate into the throat and take support against the shoulder
(17) by compressing the elastically deformable element (18).
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the fixing element (19) has
a radial finger (21) guided into a groove (22) of the hub of the push-button. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the groove (22) is formed
of two portions : a helical portion and a circular portion.
