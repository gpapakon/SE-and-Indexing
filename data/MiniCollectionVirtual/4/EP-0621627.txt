<ABSTRACT>
A universal filter apparatus is described which provides, 
in a single unit, an anti-glare and/or anti-static screen 

and frame which is adaptable to monitors of varying 
sizes. The universal filter apparatus includes a filter 

screen (1) mounted to a housing (2). The housing includes a front 
side (3), a top side (4) and at least two lateral sides (5,6) each 

of the at least two lateral sides (5,6) extending perpendicularly 
from the front side. A elastically deformable nonresistant 

securing device (7,8) is attached to each of the two lateral 
sides to allow the apparatus to be easily installed on monitors 

of varying sizes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for mounting a
frame upon articles of varying sizes. More particularly,
the present invention relates to anti-glare and/or anti-static
screens which are mountable on or over a video
display monitor and corresponding bezel such as that
which are a part of a television or computer terminal.With the widespread use of computer terminals, there is
an increasing demand for anti-glare and anti-static
devices to reduce either or both the glare and/or static
which is reflected off the computer screen. A number of
such devices are known in the art. For example, it is
known in the art to mount an adhesive strip to the
computer monitor and a corresponding adhesive strip to
the anti-glare screen frame in order to provide a
removable anti-glare screen apparatus. Such a system,
however, poses unnecessary complications. For example,
it requires that an adhesive material be near permanently
mounted to either the computer screen or the surrounding
bezel. Moreover, the device is comprised of several
components rather than a single unit.Another drawback of prior art systems is that they fail
to eliminate the problems caused by dust and light
seepage onto the monitor face negatively affecting the
clarity of the image. In its attempt to mold itself to
the shapes of various monitor screen and bezel
configurations, the above mentioned prior art systems 
leave gaps between the anti-glare screen and the bezel.The static electricity generated by the computer screen attracts dust which can
enter through these gaps and settle on the monitor screen and on the inside of the
anti-glare screen thereby obstructing the user's vision. This requires the user to
frequently remove the anti-glare screen in order to clean the dust off the monitor
screen, only to repeatedly weaken the adhesion and affecting both the screen's
placement in relationship to the monitor screen and its utility.Another problem caused by the gap between the anti-glare screen and the bezel is
slight seepage. Light can enter the gaps between the bezel and the filter screen and
reflect back and forth between the monitor and filter screens thereby adding to the
glare which reflects off the monitor screen into the eyes of the user.As a result, there is a need for an apparatus in a single unit which is readily
adaptable to monitors of varying sizes, is easily transferable to other monitors of
differing sizes, and which eliminates the problem of dust and light seepage.For an example of a prior art filter device corresponding to the

A universal filter apparatus (10), comprising :

a) a housing having a front side (3; 110), a top side (4; 101), and at
least two lateral sides (5, 6; 102-106, 108), each of the at least two lateral sides

extending substantially perpendicularly from the front side and terminating at a
rear end portion, each of the top side and at least two lateral sides having an

interior face and an exterior face;
(b) a filter screen (1) positioned in the front side of the housing; and
