<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of PN modulators (28) are provided corresponding 
to a plurality of oscillators (22) at stages preceding or 

following them, or fluctuation is given to division ratios at 
the oscillators (22). Since each of n carriers combined by a 

combiner (24) contains phase fluctuation, the possibility 
that the peaks will overlap each other or that the carriers 

having opposite phases will negate each other is very low. 
The peak power in signals supplied to the amplifier (14) to 

be tested is unlikely to vary, enabling accurate evaluation 
or testing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for testing or evaluating
an amplifier which amplifies frequency components of n
waves, n being an integer of 2 or greater, at the same time
by supplying the frequency components to the amplifier.For example, a method of simultaneously amplifying a
plurality of carriers such as eight, 16, or 24 waves is used
in a base station system for mobile communication. Figure 7
shows a schematic block diagram of a system using such a
method.The system shown in Figure 7 comprises oscillators 10-1,
10-2, ..., 10-n, a combiner 12, an amplifier 14, and a
communication antenna 16. The oscillators 10-1, 10-2, ...,
10-n oscillate at predetermined frequencies f1, f2, ..., fn
respectively. The combiner 12 combines oscillation outputs
of the oscillators 10-1, 10-2, ..., 10-n and feeds the
combined result into the amplifier 14, which then amplifies
it. The amplified result is transmitted through the
communication antenna 16. In the system shown in Figure 7, a 
plurality of carriers having frequencies f1, f2, ..., fn are
combined and then amplified.Performance evaluation of such a system, particularly of
the amplifier 114 requires a testing device which has a
signal source for generating a large number of carriers at
the same time. If a testing device appropriate for such an
application is designed based on the practical sense of those
skilled in the art, the schematic configuration of the testing
device will be presented as shown in Figure 8.The testing device 18 shown in Figure 8 comprises a
reference oscillator 20, oscillators 22-1, 22-2, ..., 22-n,
and a combiner 24. Each of the oscillators 22-1, 22-2, ...,
22-n is configured as a PLL (phase locked loop) circuit, for
example. The reference oscillator 20 oscillates at a predetermined
reference frequency and feeds its oscillation output
into the oscillators 22-1, 22-2, ..., 22-n. The oscillators
22-1, 22-2, ..., 22-n use the oscillation output of the
reference oscillator 20 as frequency and phase reference and
oscillate at their respective predetermined frequencies f1,
f2, ..., fn. Each division ratio of the reference frequency
at the oscillators 22-1, 22-2, ..., 22-n is set to a
predetermined value by a controller (not shown). The
combiner 24 combines oscillation outputs of the oscillators 
22-1, 22-2, ..., 22-n and supplies the result to the amplifier
14 to be tested.If the testing device 18 is thus configured as a PLL
synthesizer, only one reference oscillator 20 is sufficient
to give the reference frequency, simplifying the
