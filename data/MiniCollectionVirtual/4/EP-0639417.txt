<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing powder injection molded parts which comprises the steps of quickly raising the 
temperature of a molded body comprised of a bi
nder composition, which contains at least two kinds of thermoplastic 
binder components having different evaporation starting temperatures not lower than the injection molding temperature, 

to a level higher than the evaporation starting temperature of a binder component of the lowest evaporation starting 
temperature so as to remove the binder component of the lowest evaporation starting temperature from the molded 

body while retaining this increased temperature, and thereafter raising the temperature of the molded body up to a level 
not lower than the evaporation starting temperature of a binder component having the highest evaporation starting 

temperature so as to remove all of the binder components. This process serves to eliminate the unstability of the 
shape of a final product which constitutes a problem with the conventional techniques, thus satisfying the dimensional 

accuracy, and to reduce the binder removing time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing
parts by powder injection molding, and more particularly,
relates to a method of removing binder from a molded body
during manufacturing the part by the above manufacturing
method.Powder injection molding is a method capable of
producing parts having a three-dimensionally complicated
form accurately as well as efficiently. Characteristics of
this manufacturing method are in the introduction of the
injection molding method used for plastic into conventional
powder metallurgy. Compared with conventional powder
metallurgy, this method requires a large quantity of binder,
and the binder having a low viscosity at high temperature is
used. Accordingly, the result of the debinding process for
removing this influences quality and productivity thereof.
Thereupon, the binder used in powder injection molding must
satisfy high fluidity of powder-binder complex required in
the injection molding process, and must satisfy debinding
rate and shape retention required in the debinding process.
Particularly, low melting point binder, such as carnauba 
wax, paraffin wax, polyethylene wax and stearic acid, is
essential for a binder composition for powder injection
molding, because of not only improving uniform filling
ability of a complex form part due to the improvement in
fluidity in the injection molding process, and exercising an
excellent effect of demolding from a forming mold, but also
not varying the blended amount of binder in a molded body
due to its high evaporation point. However, the method of
removing waxes, which are low melting components, from a
powder injection molded body efficiently without forming
defects was accompanied with difficulties.As the debinding method of injection molded parts,
vacuum dewaxing and solvent extraction have been proposed in
addition to conventional thermal decomposition. However,
these methods are unsatisfactory because of having a problem
in equipment cost, productivity, safety and quality, and the
thermal decomposition still occupies the main current.As the thermal decomposition, Japanese Patent KOKAI
51-25507 discloses a method of removing binder organic
components without inducing physical change by decomposing
the components by the stepwise temperature elevation
corresponding to the components. However, even in this
method, unless debinding atmosphere is selected so that the
reaction with binder and binder becomposed gas does not
occur, it is impossible to shorten the debinding process
sufficiently, because chemical

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a powder injection molded
part which comprises, using a binder composition comprising

at least 2 kinds of thermoplastic binder components
having an evaporation temperature higher than the

injection molding temperature and a different evaporation
initiating temperature from each other,

elevating the temperature of a molded
body above the evaporation initiating temperature of the

binder component having the lowest evaporation initiating
temperature which is in the range of 150 to 280°C rapidly 

in a debinding furnace which
has been heated to above the evaporation

initiating temperature of the binder component having the
lowest evaporation initiating temperature previously, 

by removing the binder component having the
lowest evaporation initiating-temperature from the molded

body through thermal decomposition thereof being conducted
as endothermic reaction in an atmosphere inactive to all

of the binder components and thermal decomposition products
thereof by keeping this temperature, and thereafter,

removing all binder components by elevating up to a temperature
not lower than the evaporation initiating temperature

of the binder component having the highest evaporation
initiating temperature which is in the range of 250

to 400°C. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the highest evaporation
initiating temperature is 300 to 350°C.
