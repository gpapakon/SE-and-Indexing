<ABSTRACT>
There are described 17-alkyl carbonate-21-carbonic/carboxylic acid esters of corticosteroids of the formula I 
<
IMAGE
>
 where A is CHOH or CHCl, CH2, C = O, a 9(11) double bond; Y is H, F, Cl; Z is H, F, CH3; R(1) is aryl, hetaryl; n and m are zero or 1; R(2) is alkyl, -(CH2)2-OCH3; R(3) is H, methyl. They are obtained by reacting a compound of the formula II 
<

>
 in which R(5) is OH, with an activated carboxylic acid of the formula III  R(6)-CO-(O)n-[(C1-C4)-alkyl]m-R(1)      III The compounds I have very potent local and topical anti-inflammatory activity and show a very good ratio of local to systemic anti-inflammatory action, which is often clearly superior compared with analogous corticoid 17-alkyl carbonate 21-esters which do not carry an aryl or hetaryl group in the 21 ester radical.
