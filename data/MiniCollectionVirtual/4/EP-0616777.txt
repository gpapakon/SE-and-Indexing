<ABSTRACT>
A feed for domestic fowls which comprises a galacto-oligosaccharide 
composition which is prepared by heat-treating 

lactose in the presence of a mineral acid; or by adding an 
inorganic acid to lactose and then heat-treating the resulting 

mixture using an extruder. The feed serves to inhibit the 
formation of fatty liver, to improve the meat quality and the 

rate of egg laying, to improve the eggshell strength and to 
reduce the cholesterol content in the egg.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feed for domestic fowls
and more specifically to a feed for domestic fowls which can
improve the lipometabolism of fowls and inhibit the formation of
fatty liver to thus improve the meat quality and which permits
the reduction of the cholesterol content in eggs and can improve
the egg-laying rate and the eggshell strength.It has been a recent tendency to make the formula feeds
for fowls more thick (so-called thickened feeds) or increase the
content of proteins and make them calorific for the improvement
of the efficiency thereof. Thus, fowls take energy more than
the required energy intake and accordingly, there is a sign of
frequent incidence of abnormalities in lipometabolism such as
excess accumulation of fats in, for instance, peritoneal
cavity, intestinal tracts and hypodermis or formation of fatty
liver. This accordingly leads to reduction in the performance
of meat production (inclusive of viscus meat) in case of the
chicken breed and reduction in the egg-laying rate and in the
rate of cracked eggs due to reduction in the eggshell strength
in case of the egg breed.Recently, eating habits have been improved and on the 
other hand, the diseases of adult people have become a matter of
great concern, in particular, arterial scleroses have widely
and deeply been recognized. Cholesterols derived from foods have
been known as causative substances of arterial scleroses.
Recent investigations have proved that there is a positive
correlation between the quantity of cholesterols taken in the
form of foods and the content thereof in the serum. Moreover, it
has also been recognized that a positive correlation is
observed between the quantity of cholesterols taken in the form
of foods and the mortality rate of cardiopathy due to arterial
scleroses and it has been proved that the mortality rate of
cardiopathy due to arterial scleroses increases as the amount of
cholesterols taken in the form of foods increases.The fowl egg is a representative example of foods having
high contents of cholesterols. The amounts of various foods
taken and the mortality rate of cardiopathy were examined on
adult male people of 55 to 59-year-old and it was proved that
there was a significant positive correlation between the amount
of fowl egg-intake and the mortality rate of cardiopathy (r =
0.666). Nevertheless, the fowl egg is an excellent nutrient
substance as a source of high quality protein, is a food
desirably taken at least one per day and accordingly, there has
been desired for the

<CLAIMS>
Use of a galacto-oligosaccharide composition which mainly
comprises glucose and galactose as essential saccharide components and has a

ratio of glucose to galactose of 1:1 for reducing the content of cholesterol in
eggs and improving the egg-laying rate and the eggshell strength in the

preparation of a feed for domestic fowls.
Use according to claim 1 wherein the galacto-oligosaccharide
composition comprises not less than 10 % by weight of glucose residues on the

nonreducing termini.
Use according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the galacto-oligosaccharide
composition is obtainable by heat-treating lactose in the presence of a mineral

acid.
Use according to claim 3 wherein the content of the galacto-oligosaccharide
composition ranges from 0.1 to 5 % by weight on the basis of

the weight of the feed.
Use according to claim 3 or 4 wherein the galacto-oligosaccharide
composition comprises not less than 40 % by weight of trisaccharides and

higher saccharides.
Use according to claim 1 wherein the galacto-oligosaccharide
composition is obtainable by adding an inorganic acid to lactose and then

heat-treating the resulting mixture using an extruder. 
Use according to claim 6 wherein the galacto-oligosaccharide
composition comprises not less than 40 % by weight of trisaccharides and

higher saccharides.
Use according to claim 6 or 7 wherein the extruder is selected from
single screw extruders each comprising a single rotatable screw inserted in a

cylinder and twin screw extruders each comprising two rotative screws in the
same direction or opposite directions and inserted in cylinders having an 8-shaped

cross section.
Use according to one of claims 6 to 8 wherein the extruder is operated

at a temperature ranging from 100 to 200Â°C for 5 to 20 seconds.
Use according to one of claims 6 to 9 wherein the content of the
galacto-oligosaccharide composition ranges from 0.1 to 5 % by weight on the

basis of the weight of the feed.
