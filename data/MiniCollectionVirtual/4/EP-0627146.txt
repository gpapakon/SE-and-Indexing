<ABSTRACT>
A method and a system for establishing in real time a connection between a first party (A) and a second party (B) via at least one telecommunication network. The invention is characterized in that the connection is initiated by sending a connection request containing the meeting reference (PA, PB) of each party in the telecommunication network or networks to a third party, called the meeting organizer (MA) which, on the basis of the connection request and also on the basis of predetermined criteria, reaches a decision as to a favourable common meeting point (MA) in a telecommunication network (T) for the first and the second parties. Instances of an assignment process which has the purpose of generating the connection request are used as a reference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for establishing
a connection between two parties while using
one or more telecommunication networks. More specifically,
although not exclusively, the invention relates
to a method for establishing the aforesaid connection
in the form of a meeting at a meeting point. The
meeting point can be placed at any desired node in the
network. The method enables the meeting point to be
chosen with respect to the geographical location of
the parties in the network and with respect to current
traffic conditions and in complete disregard of fixed
routing tables.The present invention is related to the following five
patent documents, to which the following description
refers:
(1) "A Method of Establishing an Intelligent Network
Service", WO93/16543.(2) "A Method of Organizing Communication",
WO93/16545;(3) "A Method of Establishing Cooperation with a
Functionality", WO93/16547;(4) "A Person Paging Method", WO93/16564; and(5) "A Method of Supporting Communication",
WO93/16546;These applications
describe mechanisms which can
be used in the method according to the present invention.By communication services is meant conventional telephony
services, telex services, datapack services,
datel services, telefax services, videotext services,
ISDN-services, mobile telephony services, personal
paging services, tele-point-services and general
communication between two or more parties. The services
recited above are only examples of the services
possible and are not intended to limit the scope of
the invention.By telecommunication network is normally meant the
telephone networks, telex networks, circuit connected
data networks, picture information transfer networks,
private telecommunication networks, radio networks,
satellite communication networks and general carriers
of the communication services, such as analog transmission,
digital transmission, synchronous, multiplex
or asynchronous multiplex transmission, ATM, etc., for
example. These networks are recited solely by way of
example and the invention is not restricted thereto.By functionality is meant the ability to perform an
operation in a telecommunication network. Examples of
functionality include activities and services that can
be performed in the telecommunication network. Examples
of functionalities include an enquiry to establish
a connection path or route between two parties,
digit analysis, billing or ticketing. Although not
necessary, the functionality may require the availability
of dedicated equipment for carrying out
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of establishing in real time a connection
between a first party (A) and a second party (B) via

at least one telecommunication network, said connection
being initiated by sending a connection request

containing the meeting reference (PA,PB) of each party
in the telecommunication network or networks to a

third party, called the meeting organizer (MA) 
charazterized

in that the meeting organizer:

decides on the basis the connection request and on the
basis of predetermined criteria a meeting point (MA;

MA1; M) common to the first and second parties, said
meeting
 point below referred to as a meeting node,
decides the connections to and from the access nodes
(X,Y) of each party and to and from said meeting node

(X, MA, MA1, Y) which are required in order to establish
said real time connection, by pointing out those

of said nodes which shall originate connections and
those of said nodes which shall terminate connections,
initiates reservation of idle interaction numbers
(IA(MX), IA(MY)) in nodes, selected among said nodes,

which shall terminate connections, said interaction
numbers being selected in the number series of the

nodes which are to terminate connections,
commands each terminating node to monitor its input
ports and detect the one at which there is a call

which as address has the interaction number reserved
by the same node,
sends, to each node which is to originate connections,
one interaction number per each connection to

be originated as well as a command to initiate the
corresponding calls by using said interaction numbers.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that the common meeting point is
placed at one of those meeting points selected from 

the group of meeting points comprised of:

(a) the access node (X) of one party (A) in the
telecommunication network;
(b) the access node (Y) of the other party (B) in the
telecommunication network; and
(c) some other point in a telecommunication network.
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterized

in that the common meeting point is
obtained by


(a) placing a first meeting point in a first switching
node to which the one party has a first connection;
(b) placing a second meeting point in a second switching
node to which the second party has a second

connection; and
(c) initiating a connection between the first and the
second meeting points.
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterized

in that the meeting reference (PA or
PB) is created by an assignment process in the node to

which one party has access and contains at least one
reference to the desired meeting and one reference to

said node to which one party has access.
A method in accordance with claim 2, wherein the
meeting node is in a node which is located between the

access nodes (X,Y) of the parties,

in that the meeting organizer (MA) reserves two
interaction numbers (IA(MX),IA(MY)) in the number

series of the meeting node (MA), associates the meeting
reference (PA) of the first party (A) with the

first interaction number (IA(MX)) and associates the
meeting reference (PB) of the second party (B) with

the second interaction number (IA(MY)), in that the
access node (X) of the first party (A) establishes a 

first originating connection towards the meeting node
using the first interaction number (IA(MX)), in that

the access node (Y) of the second party (B) establishes
