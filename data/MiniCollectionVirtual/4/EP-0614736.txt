<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for controlling the thickness of board 
products (4) during the pressing process in a board press 

with a first and a second press table (5,2) where the 
pressing force is transferred by several hydraulic press 

cylinders (1). A number of hydraulic position valves 
(7) are arranged in spaced relationship on both sides 

of the press on the first press table (5). Corresponding 
push-rods (9) are arranged on the second press table 

(2). The push-rods are adjustable, and a common shifting 
motor (12) is provided for simultaneous adjustment of 

the push-rods (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an arrangement for controlling 
the thickness of board products during the pressing in 
board presses, particularly presses with few openings. At the manufacture of board-shaped products where the starting 
material is resilient mats loosely bound together, 
the mats are compressed under pressure while simultaneously 
heat is supplied from the press surfaces consisting of 
the heating plates of the press. The mats are compressed 
to a final thickness whereafter in an application at the 
manufacture of fibre board according to the dry method 
or of particle board, a hot-setting glue cures and 
provides the board with sufficient strength for the pressing 
to be completed. At other applications, for example at the 
manufacture of fiber board according to the wet method, 
natural glue substances in the fiber mat yield the necessary 
strength after heating and drying. Other types of products 
pressed under heat and pressure can also be a possible 
choice. At the manufacture of the aforesaid products, it is known 
to control the final thickness in several different ways, 
by means of spacing strips, electrical position scanners 
or hydraulic direct acting valves. Each of these means 
has its special disadvantages. Spacing strips in most cases are attached along the long 
sides of the press, outside the press material, or in the 
vicinity of press cylinders, placed outside the press 
material. Spacing strips, as the term indicates, can be 
used only for controlling a certain predetermined final 
thickness. The thickness of the spacing strip has been 
determined at the manufacture and cannot be changed thereafter, 
if the boards would show to be thinner or thicker than  
 
desired, even if the spacing strips happen to have the ideal 
thickness. Such deviations can occur for several reasons. 
One reason is that spacing strips and countercurrent surfaces 
after some time of operation are coated with material from 
the press material. Thickness deviation also can occur when 
the hydraulic system of the press and the press tables are 
designed so that loads arise which are greater than required 
by the mat, resulting in deflections across the press and 
thereby in thickness deviations. In addition to the aforesaid drawbacks with fixed predetermined 
thickness, production losses also occur with spacing 
strips when the strip thickness is changed. Spacing strips, as mentioned, can be used only for controlling 
the final thickness. The movement of the press toward final 
thickness cannot be
