<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a cornea operating method using an ultraviolet laser, such as 
an excimer laser 

for carrying out the correction of flexion abnormality of myopic, hypermetropic and astigmatic corneas or a turbid 

cornea treatment, and an apparatus used for this cornea operating method. In the method according 
to this invention, 

a cornea (1) is cooled before, during and after an operation thereon, and a liquid medicine 
having cornea curing, 

healing promoting and antiphlogistic effects is sprinkled or sprayed over the cornea (1) at 
least before and after an 

operation, and preferably before, during and after an operation, a laser beam applied to the cornea 
after an 

excess liquid medicine has been removed from the cornea. According to the present invention, 
a side effect caused 

by the photochemical thermal reaction of a cornea due to the application of a laser beam 
can be minimized owing to 

the cooling of the cornea and the action of the liquid medicine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for conducting
an operation on the cornea of an eye for correcting
an abnormal curve of the cornea of the eye,
such as myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism, or for
treating opacity of the cornea of the eye,
and to a cooling apparatus.For correcting an abnormal curve of the
cornea of an eye, such as myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism,
or for treating opacity of the cornea of the
eye, there have heretofore been conducted surgical
operations in which the cornea of the eye is rubbed by
a spatula-like scalpel, or is ground by a rotating
file. However, in the case of using such a spatula-like
scalpel or a file, there have been encountered
drawbacks that it has been difficult to accurately form
the optical axis of the eye since the eyeball moves
during the operation, that the operation on the cornea
could not be performed smoothly and neatly, so that
satisfactory treatment effects could not be expected,
and that much time has been required for the curing
after the operation.As a surgical operation on the cornea of an 
eye replacing this, there is already known a method of
conducting an operation on the cornea of an eye by the
use of a laser knife, for example, from U. S. Patent
No. 4,718,418 and U. S. Patent No. 4,994,058. However,
even with this operation method using a laser, there
have been pointed out problems that adverse effects due
to photochemical heat such, for example, as an attack
on the tissue of the cornea, are intense, so that after
the operation, the cornea is liable to undergo a tissue
destruction, a burn, alternation, distortion, opacity
and so on, and that much time is required for the
curing after the operation.To solve these problems, an operation on the
cornea has now been conducted using an ultraviolet
laser, particularly an excimer laser, which is said to
less suffer from the effects of photochemical heat
among lasers; however, even with the excimer laser, the
effects due to a photochemical thermal reaction can not
be entirely avoided.When ablating the tissue of the cornea with
an excimer laser, the molecules of the cornea are cut,
and this is called ablation. When the excimer laser is
applied to the cornea, many free radicals are produced
with the ablation, and also it is thought that the
following phenomenon occurs. The moisture in the
corneal stroma is dissipated as steam upon laser beam
radiation, and also is heated to a temperature of
200∼300 °C to be formed into bubbles in the cornea, and 
moves actively to destroy the arrangement of collagen
