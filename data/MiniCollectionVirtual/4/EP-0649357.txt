<ABSTRACT>
A resistance spot welding apparatus (10) includes a base (11) mounted on a sliding track (12) along a fixed orientation to a rotary part (14) to be balanced. An arm (18) is pivotable about pin (20) which is rigidly attached to the base (11). The arm (18) provides a platform for a welding gun assembly (26). Electrodes (27, 29) provide current to weld a balance weight (28) to the rotary part (14). The welding gun assembly's electrode (27) is positionable by cylinder rod (46) rigidly attached to a positioning bracket (42). The position of the positioning bracket is determined by linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) (58). The position of the bracket (42) is used to determine electrode positioning faults and weld quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to welding guns, and
more particularly, to resistance welding guns used in
conjunction with an automated welding system.Conventional resistance spot welding
techniques employ a method by which metal surfaces are
joined together in one or more spots. Workpieces are
held together under force by one or more electrodes.
The contacting surfaces are heated by a pulse of high
amperage current generated by contact with the
electrodes to form what is known as a weld nugget at the
interface between the two surfaces. When the flow of
current ceases, the electrode force is ordinarily
maintained for a short period of time to allow the weld
nugget to cool and solidify forming a strong mechanical
bond. An excellent discussion of the details of the
metallurgical phenomena that occurs during resistant
spot welding is found in Nied "The Finite Element
Modelling of the Resistance Spot Welding Process",
Welding Research Supplement, pp. 123-132 (April, 1984).The popularity of resistance spot welding is
due in large part to its capability of rapidly producing
welds with apparatus that can be used in automated
production. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,959 to
Cecil discloses a resistance welding gun for cooperation
with a robotic arm. This type of device affords a
production system great versatility for high volume
applications. While resistance spot welding has many
advantages, it is difficult to control the process
satisfactorily in order to produce consistently good
welds. Many different factors must be controlled such
as voltage, current, pressure, heat loss, shunting, and
electrode wear, as well as the thickness and composition
of the workpiece material. Many of these variables are
difficult to consistently control.Several attempts have been made to
automatically control resistance spot welding processes.
For example, some techniques have been designed to
regulate the amount of energy used during the weld
cycle. To this end, current sensors and voltage
regulators have been incorporated into feedback systems
to compare the detected levels with certain preset
references. These feedback systems are disadvantageous
from the standpoint that they do not directly detect
physical characteristics of the weld itself but instead
rely upon detection of secondary parameters. This can
lead to poor weld quality when uncontrolled parameters
vary from nominal operating conditions.Other techniques provide means for determining
whether the metal of the workpieces have reached a
molten state. If the metals to be
