<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for winding a heating wire (1) on a core for forming the inner 
periphery of an electric melt-bonding joint, which comprises a core (6) in a 

generally cylindrical shape which is capable of roating around its axial center, 
the core being relatively moved in the axial direction with respect to the 

heating wire, an engaging piece (7a) mounted on the core, which has a 
holding portion for holding the heating wire, and a fixing means (5) to fix a 

terminal pin (1a) to the leading end of the heating wire, wherein the 
engaging piece has a holding portion (71) for holding the terminal pin, 

whereby the heating wire is wound on an outer peripheral portion of the core 
by rotating the core.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for winding a heating wire on an outer
peripheral portion of a core for forming by injection
molding an electrically melt-bonding joint in which the
heating wire is embedded in the joint.In recent years, when synthetic resin pipes such as
gas pipes, water pipes or the like are connected to each
other, an electrically melt-bonding joint A in which a
heating wire 1 is embedded in the inner peripheral
surface of its socket portions as shown in Figure 8 have
been used. When the pipes are connected with the
electrically melt-bonding joint A, the synthetic resin
pipes are inserted to the socket portions at both ends
and a power source is connected to terminal pins la
attached to the heating wire 1 to heat the wire whereby
the synthetic pipe is melt-bonded to the joint.A method of making the electrically melt-bonding
joint, which has been widely used, comprises a winding
step wherein the heating wire is wound in a coil form by 
a predetermined number of turns on an outer peripheral
portion of a core for forming the inner periphery of the
joint, a terminal processing step wherein the heating
wire is cut to have a predetermined length, and each end
portion of the heating wire is inserted into each
terminal pin to thereby electrically connect the terminal
pins to the heating wire, and a shaping step wherein the
core on which the heating wire is wound in a coil form is
set in a metal mold, and molten resin is injected into
the metal mold.In another method of winding a heating wire, known from
EP-A-0 303 909, the core carries, out opposite ends, respective
terminal pegs, the free end of the wire being secured around one
terminal peg before winding commences, and the other end of the
wire winding being secured around the other terminal
peg after winding has been completed. The apparatus
for winding a heating wire on a core known from EP-A-0 303 909
comprises the features mentioned in the prior art portion of claims 2 and 3.However, the conventional method had problems in the
winding step and the terminal processing step in the
manufacture of the electrically melt-bonding joint.
Namely, when the terminal pins are electrically connected
to the both ends of the heating wire after the heating
wire has been wound on an outer peripheral portion of the
core, it was necessary to conduct operations for
connecting the terminal pins to the heating wire in a
limited narrow space near the core. Accordingly, it was
difficult to employ automation or a linear

A method of winding a heating wire (1) coated with an insulation resin on
an outer peripheral portion of a core (6) for forming the inner periphery of

an electrically melt-bonding joint (A), said method comprising the
following steps:


(a) drawing out the leading end of the heating wire wound on a rewinding
roller (2), peeling off an insulation resin at the leading end portion of the

heating wire and connecting to a leading end portion a terminal pin (1a), and
engaging the terminal pin with an engaging piece (7a) which is rotatable

along with the core (6), and rotating the core so that the heating wire is
wound on an outer peripheral portion of the core,
(b) continuing to rotate the core to wind the heating wire on the outer
peripheral portion of the core by a predetermined number of turns, stopping

the rotation of the core, and applying an electric heating iron (8) onto a
wound portion of the heating wire to melt the insulaion resin on the heating

wire and at the same time, melt-bonding adjacent portions of the wound
heating wire with the molten insulation resin,
(c) starting to rotate the core to wind the heating wire on the outer
peripheral portion by a predetermined number of turns, stopping the

rotation of the core, cutting an unwound portion of the heating wire, peeling
off the insulation resin covering the heating wire near the cut portion, and

fixing a terminal pin (1a) to the rear end near the cut portion of the heating
wire, and
(d) engaging the terminal pin fixed to the rear end of the heating wire
with a pulling device (9), rota
ting the core while applying a tension to the
heating wire so that the rear end portion of the heating wire is wound on the

outer peripheral portion of the core, and applying the electric heating iron
(8) onto the heating wire near the terminal pin to melt the insulation resin

covering the heating wire and at the same time, to melt-bond the rear end
portion to the adjacent portion of the heating wire with the molten insulation

resin.
