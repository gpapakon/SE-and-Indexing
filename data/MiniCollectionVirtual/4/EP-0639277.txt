<ABSTRACT>
A calibration reagent of the type including known concentrations of one or more gases dissolved in a carrier vehicle further includes helium dissolved therein. The helium acts to stabilize the concentration of dissolved gases. The reagents are very useful in the calibration of a wide variety of gas analysis equipment and may be readily stored under a wide range of ambient conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CALIBRATION REAGENTHAVINGASTABILIZED CONCENTRATIONOFDISSOLVEDGASField of the InventionThis invention relates generally to the calibration of analysis equipment. More specifically, the present invention relates to calibration reagents including dissolved gases therein. Most specifically, the present invention relates to reagents for calibrating blood gas analysis systems.Background of the InventionAutomated chemical analyses are rapidly supplanting manual techniques, particularly in the health care field. The rapid and accurate analysis of blood chemistry is particularly important in operating rooms, critical care facilities and clinical environments.It is necessary to calibrate analysis systems in order to assure the accuracy and reliability of their results. Calibration is typically carried out by the use of reagents which are facsimiles of the materials being analyzed and which include known quantities of the target analytes therein. For example, equipment for blood gas analysis is typically calibrated by utilizing a blood facsimile which includes known concentrations of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide therein and which may further include bicarbonate, calcium, sodium and potassium ions, as well as other ionic species and organic species such as glucose. 

 There are many problems associated with the use of liquid based calibration reagents which contain dissolved gases. The concentration of a given gas in a liquid will vary depending upon the ambient temperature and pressure conditions to which the liquid is exposed. Furthermore, atmospheric gases can dissolve into the liquid thereby changing the concentration of particular species therein.One approach to the problem of providing accurate calibration reagents for blood gas analysis equipment involves the on site preparation of the reagents by the tono etery of liquid with a known concentration of gas. In this process, a gas is bubbled through a liquid under controlled conditions? the concentration of gases in the reagent may be calculated after compensating for temperature and barometric pressure, and the solution is ready for use in a calibration procedure. Solutions thus prepared must be used very promptly since their gas concentration can change rapidly. Another approach to the problem of calibration solutions involves the use of previously prepared solutions which are stored in a flexible, relatively gas-impermeable package having zero headspace. By zero headspace is meant that the liquid occupies the entirety of the package and there is no
