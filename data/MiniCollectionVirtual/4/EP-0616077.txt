<ABSTRACT>
A tamping machine (1) for the compaction of a railway (2) ballast consists of a machine frame (4), supported on rail running gear, and of a stabilisation assembly (9) connected to said machine frame so as to be adjustable in height. Said stabilisation assembly can be caused to oscillate horizontally as well as vertically with respect to the machine longitudinal direction by means of vibrators (15) and is designed to be able to travel on tracks via flanged rollers (11). The mutual distance of the flanged rollers (11) perpendicularly to the machine longitudinal direction can be varied by means of a spreading drive (13). The latter is designed as a multi-position cylinder comprising a first and a second cylinder tube (22, 23) arranged one behind the other in the axial direction and having respectively a first and a second, double-acting piston rod (24, 25). The latter is connected in an articulated fashion to an adjoining axle (26) of one of the flanged rollers (11) located opposite one another with respect to the axial direction.

A machine for consolidating the ballast bed of a 
track, comprising a machine frame (4) supported on on-track 

undercarriages (3) and a stabilizer unit (9) which is 
connected for vertical adjustment to the said machine frame 

and which, by means of vibrators (15), may be set vibrating 
horizontally and perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction 

of the machine, and which is designed for mobility on the 
track on flanged rollers (11) whose distance apart, extending 

perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the machine, 
is variable by means of a spreading mechanism (13), the 

spreading mechanism being in the form of a cylindrical tube 
(22) having a double-action piston rod which is connected to 

an axle of one of the flanged rollers, characterized in that 
the spreading mechanism (13) which is designed as a multiple 

position cylinder comprises, in addition to the said first 
cylindrical tube (22), a second cylindrical tube (23) arranged 

following the said first cylindrical tube in the axial 
direction, each of the first and second piston rods (24,25) 

associated therewith being connected in an articulated manner 
to an adjoining axle (26) of one of the flanged rollers (11) 

situated opposite one another with respect to the axial 
direction, and one of the two axles (26) connected to 

the spreading mechanism (13) further being mounted for 
displacement in the axial direction in a bearing (27) of an 

auxiliary housing (14) while the other axle (26) is rigidly 
fixed in the bearing (27). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the two cylindrical tubes (22,23) are arranged coaxially and 

are joined together to form a common structural unit.  
 
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the lengths of stroke of the two piston rods (24,25) are 

designed to be different. 
A machine according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the length of stroke of the first piston rod (24) is 15 

mm and that of the second piston rod (25) is 45 mm.
