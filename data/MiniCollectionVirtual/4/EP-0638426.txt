<ABSTRACT>
The nozzle cover for an inkjet print head is in one piece 
and made of a chemically cross-linking elastomer layer (10) 

which adheres to nozzle outlet surface (4). The non-cross-linked 
elastomer material (2) is applied to the nozzle outlet 

surface (4) in liquid state and then brought to a rectangular 
form. The subsequent cross-linking process produces 

an elastomer layer (10) which adheres adhesively to the 
nozzle outlet surface (4). The elastomer layer (10) is 

pulled off before the inkjet print head is installed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a nozzle cover for an inkjet 
printing head. Inkjet print heads exhibit microstructured and consequently 
sensitive components. These include the ink transport 
channels which terminate in a flat surface in the form 
of a nozzle. This surface is commonly referred to as the 
nozzle outlet surface. Any damage to the nozzles reduces the 
printing quality which can be achieved with the inkjet 
print head. Consequently, the nozzle outlet surfaces of inknozzle 
print heads are protected against transport and/or 
storage damage (drying out or ink leakage) by a cover. A cover for the nozzle outlet surface of an inkjet print 
head is described in the Hewlett-Packard Journal of August 
1988, page 44. The nozzle outlet surface of an inkjet 
print head is covered with an adhesive tape which forms a 
barrier preventing the leakage of ink from the nozzles. The 
adhesive tape consists of an adhesive material on a polyester 
backing. Before this adhesive tape can be applied, 
however, the nozzle outlet surface has to be cleaned with 
deionized water to remove any ink residues. The adhesive 
tape must be applied immediately after cleaning so that ink 
cannot leak from the nozzles again, thus reducing the adhesion 
and/or the sealing effect. It cannot be ruled out 
that residues of adhesive remain on the nozzle nozzles when 
the adhesive tape is removed, thus causing a deterioration 
in the printing quality.  European patent application EP-OS 0 418 828 relates to an 
inkjet print head with cover. A sealing tape which adheres 
to one side of the ink cartridge with a bonding agent 
is pressed against the nozzle plate by a cap. The cap is of 
the same width as the nozzle plate and has two arms which 
engage in grooves on the ink cartridge. An elastic part is 
attached to the inside of the cap between the two arms. The 
arms hold the cap on the ink cartridge and at the same time 
press the elastic part against the sealing tape and the 
nozzle plate. The force exerted on the sealing tape as a result 
of the deformation of the elastic part causes the 
nozzle plate to be sealed. ♀In order to ensure good sealing 
in this case, several components must fit exactly together. 
This means that an inexpensive sealing of the nozzle outlet 
surface is not possible. The object of the invention is to create a nozzle cover 
which can be automatically fitted in one piece and removed 
without leaving any residues. Any time-consuming cleaning of 
the nozzle outlet surface before fitting the cover should be 
avoided.
