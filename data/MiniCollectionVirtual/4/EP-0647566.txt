<ABSTRACT>
This container of parallelepipedal shape includes a bottom or base (2) as well as four lateral faces (3-6) and a retractable lid (7). Two (3, 4) of the opposed lateral faces and the bottom or base (2) constitute a continuous subassembly termed "bottom subassembly" made from one and the same sheet of plastic by folding, the said assembly having two fold regions (11) formed substantially at the bottom of the said opposed lateral faces (3, 4), the other two opposing lateral faces (5, 6) being attached reversibly to the subassembly (2, 3, 4) thus formed, especially by fitting in or around them, the container thus being kept unfolded and assembled through interaction of the fittable lid (7) on to the whole (2 - 6) thus produced.

A multipurpose container, produced from plastic, which 
can be folded up,re-usable and stackable, of parallelepipedal 

shape, including a bottom or base (2), as well as four side 
faces (3-6) and a retractable lid (7), two (3, 4) of the 

opposite side faces, and the bottom or base (2) stemming from 
the same sheet of plastic and forming a continuous sub-assembly, 

the two other opposite side faces (5, 6) being 
reversibly attached to the subassembly (2, 3, 4) thus formed, 

especially by interlocking, 
characterized
 in that said 
subassembly has two supplementary foldings, made substantially 

in the lower region of said opposite side faces, and wherein 
the container is thus kept opened out and assembled by the 

interaction of the interlockable lid (7) on the entire unit (2-6) 
thus produced. 
The container as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein
 the 
bottom or base (2) includes laths of wood or of a strong 

material, these laths being surrounded by the sheet of 
plastic forming the continuous subassembly (2, 3, 4) and 

glued or fixed to said laths. 
The container as claimed in one of claims 1 and 
2, 
wherein
 the two opposite side faces (5, 6), other than 
those (3, 4) forming the subassembly called "bottom" 

subassembly (2, 3, 4), have a folded-back part (15) on 
each of the edges of the plastic sheet of which they are 

composed, in such a way as to form vertical reinforcements 
capable of preventing said container from buckling, 

especially during stacking. 
The container as claimed in claim 3, 
wherein
 the 
side edges of the two side faces (5, 6) are equipped with 

corner pieces, also produced from plastic, which are 
installed prior to the gluing, after folding back the 

edges of the plastic sheet from which they are formed. 
The container as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, 

wherein
 the reversible fixing of said two opposite side 
faces (5, 6) to the "bottom" subassembly (2, 3, 4), 

formed by the two opposite side faces (3, 4) and the  
 

bottom (2), is provided by installing screws or pivoting 
fasteners (16) made of plastic, at orifices (18, 19) 

produced beforehand in the faces in question. 
The container as claimed in claim 5, 
wherein
 the 
fasteners (16) each consist of two pieces, respectively 

a male piece (21) and a female piece (20), intended to 
interlock, one in the other, and thus to be secured to 

each other simply by pivoting the female piece (20) with 
respect to the male piece (21). 
The container as claimed in claim 6, 
wherein
: 

the female piece (20) includes: 

a circular washer (23) intended to bear on the 
outside of one of the faces (3) to be 

assembled, 
a substantially lozenge-shaped relief part 
(24), surmounting the washer (23) and coaxial 

with the latter, and itself comprising a linear 
projection (25) extending along the major axis 

of the lozenge-shaped part (24), said projection 
(25) being intended to promote pivoting of 

the entire female piece (20), when securing or 
unsecuring the faces in question of the 

package, said projection (25) being furthermore 
interrupted in the middle of it, corresponding 

in fact to the center of the washer (23), by an 
orifice (26) intended to receive a securing 

screw (22) during the production of said female 
piece, 
a cylindrical shaft (30) extending the washer 
(23) at its other face and being coaxial with 

the center of the latter, said shaft being 
intended to be inserted into the orifice 

(18, 19) of the faces to be assembled; 
the male piece (21) includes: 

a circular washer (29) intended to bear on the 
inside of the other face (15) to be assembled, 
a substantially cylindrical portion (27) extending 
the washer (29) and being coaxial with the 

center of it, said portion (27) being intended,  
 

on the one hand, to be inserted into the orifice 
(18, 19) of the faces to be assembled and, 

on the other hand, to be interlocked in the 
shaft (30) of the female part (20), said portion 

(27) being furthermore pierced by a tapped 
hole (28), coaxial with the portion (27), so as 

to interact with the screw (22) secured to said 
female part (20). 
The container as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, 

wherein
 the lid (7) receives, especially by gluing, 
elements (9) produced from plastic, especially by thermo-forming, 

defining offset cups (10) intended to interact 
with feet (8) which are likewise distributed and secured, 

especially by gluing, to the outer face of the bottom (2) 
of the upper package, in a corresponding manner, and this 

is so as to enable these packages to be stably stacked on 
top of each other. 
The container as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, 

wherein
 a sheet of expanded polystyrene, or of a complex 
comprising expanded polystyrene and a film of dielectric 

plastic, is adjoined to the inner face of the bottom (2), 
of the side faces (3,4,5,6) and of the lid (7) by gluing, 

in such a way as to confer isothermal properties on the 
package thus produced.
