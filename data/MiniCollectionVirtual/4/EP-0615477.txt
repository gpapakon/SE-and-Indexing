indexable cutting insert (36) and resting with a contact 
surface (28) on a support surface (26) of the shaft 

(10), and with a holding screw (16) connecting the tool 
head (18) to the shaft (10), with the contact surface 

(28) and the support surface (26) being arranged at an 
acute angle with respect to the axis of the shaft and 

having engaging straight tooth systems (30, 32), with 
furthermore the holding screw (26) being aligned 

essentially perpendicularly with respect to the support 
and contact surfaces (26, 28), and with the indexable 

cutting insert (36) being arranged countersunk in an 
essentially axially parallel flat surface (38) 

preferably extending through the axis of the shaft and 
defining a chip chamber, characterized in that the 

parallel teeth of the straight tooth system (30, 32) 
extend transversely with respect to the direction of 

slope of the support and contact surfaces (26, 28) and 

essentially parallel to the surface (38) containing the 
indexable cutting insert (36), and that the holding 

screw (16) has a fitted shaft (40) with which it extends 
into a fitted hole (42', 42'') extending essentially 

perpendicularly through the tool head (18) and the shaft 
(10) in the area of the contact and support surfaces 

(28, 26).  
 
The lathe tool according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the surface (38) containing the 

indexable cutting insert (36) transfers at its end 
closest to the shaft into a surface (50) which is 

essentially parallel with respect to the contact surface 
(28), which surface (50) has a perpendicularly extending 

depression (48) for the head (46) of the holding screw 
(16), which in turn transfers into the fitted hole (42') 

for the holding screw (16). 
The lathe tool according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the contact surface (28) and/or 

the support surface (26) has a concave curvature 
extending around an axis which is parallel with respect 

to the teeth of the straight tooth system (30, 32). 
The lathe tool according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the radius of curvature (R) is 

chosen according to the equation 

R = aD²cos⁻²α, 
 
where D is the diameter of the shaft, α is the angle of 

slope of the normal support surfaces with respect to the 
axis of the shaft and a is a parameter in the order of 

magnitude of 3 to 12 mm⁻¹, preferably 5 to 8 mm⁻¹. 
The lathe tool according to one of the Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the depth of the fitted hole 

(42'') at the end of the shaft corresponds with 0.5 to 
1.5 times its diameter. 
The lathe tool according to one of the Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the tool head (18) and/or 

the shaft (10) has a free depression in the area of the 
contact and support surface (28, 26), through which the 

fitted hole (42', 42'') extends.  
 
The lathe tool according to one of the claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the support surface normal 

defines an angle (α) of 15° to 45°, preferably 30°, with 
the shaft axis. 
The lathe tool according to one of the Claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that the tooth flanks of the 

straight tooth systems (30, 32) define an angle of 50° 
to 70°, preferably 60°, with one another. 
The lathe tool according to one of the Claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that one of the tooth flanks of 

the straight tooth systems (30, 32) is aligned 
essentially parallel with respect to the axially 

parallel surface (38) containing the indexable cutting 
insert (36). 
The lathe tool according to one of the Claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that the fitted hole (42') on the 

side of the tool head (18) is designed as a slotted hole 
elongated transversely to the teeth of the straight 

tooth system (32) and having a tolerance on fit in the 
direction of the tooth. 
The lathe tool according to one of the claims 1 
to 10, characterized by a cooling medium channel (62, 

66, 64) extending through the contact and support 
surfaces in the area of the straight tooth system (30, 

32) outside of the fitted holes (42', 42''), terminating 
in the chip chamber in the area of the surface 

containing the indexable cutting insert (36) or the 
depression (48), and there directed in direction of an 

active cutting edge of the indexable cutting insert 
(36), and loadable with cooling medium from the end of 

the shaft.  
 
The lathe tool according to one of the Claims 1 
to 11, characterized by an intermediate piece (52', 52'', 

52''') arranged between the shaft (10) and the tool head 
(18), which intermediate piece has on its faces (54, 

56), which are sloped with respect to the axis of the 
shaft, straight tooth systems (58, 60) complementary to 

the straight tooth systems (30, 32) of the shaft (10), 
on the one hand, and the tool head (18), on the other 

hand, through which straight tooth systems, extending in 
pairs, are fitted holes for receiving a fitted shaft of 

a holding screw.
