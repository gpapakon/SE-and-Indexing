<ABSTRACT>
Devices for the depletion of leukocytes in blood 
products, preferably comprising an upstream porous element 

including means for removal of gels, at least one 
intermediate porous element including means for removal of 

microaggregates, and a downstream element including means 
for removal of leukocytes by both adsorption and 

filtration, preferably with at least one of the elements 
having been modified to a CWST in excess of 53 dynes/cm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for depleting the leukocyte content of blood products, particularly from human packed red blood cells including cells which have been stored prior to transfusion for any period up to their allowable storage period, and a device for effecting that depletion.It has been the practice for 50 years or more to transfuse whole blood, and more recently blood components, from one or more donors to other persons. With the passage of time and accumulation of research and clinical data, transfusion practices have improved greatly. One aspect of current practice is that whole blood is rarely administered; rather, patients needing red blood cells are given packed red cells (hereinafter PRC), and patients needing platelets are given platelet concentrate. These components are separated from whole blood by centrifuging the process providing, as a third product, plasma, from which various other useful components are obtained.In addition to the three above-listed components, whole blood contains white blood cells (known collectively as leukocytes) of various types, of which the most important are granulocytes and lymphocytes. White blood cells provide protection against bacterial and viral infection.In the mid to late seventies, a number of investigators proposed that granulocytes be separated from donated blood and transfused into patients who lacked them, for example, those whose own cells had been overwhelmed by an infection. In the resulting investigations, it became apparent that this practice is generally harmful, since patients receiving such transfusion developed high fevers, had other adverse reactions, and generally rejected the transfused cells. Further, the transfusion of packed cells or whole blood containing donor leukocytes can be harmful to the recipient in other ways. Some of the viral diseases induced by transfusion therapy, e.g., Cytomegaloviral Inclusion Disease which is a life threatening infection to newborns and debilitated adults, are transmitted by the infusion of homologous leukocytes. Another life-threatening phenomenon affecting immunocompromised patients is Graft versus host: disease (GVH); a disease in which the transfused leukocytes actually cause irreversible damage to the blood recipient's organs including the skin, gastrointestinal tract and neurological system. Conventional red cell transfusions have also been indicted as adversely influencing the survival of patients undergoing surgery for malignancy of the large intestine. It is believed that this
