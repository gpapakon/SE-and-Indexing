<ABSTRACT>
A gear-driven compressor for the compression of oxygen contains one or more compressor stages (1 to 4) carried by rotor shafts (8) and enclosed in each case by a compressor casing (15). The rotor shafts (8) are driven by an integrated, oil-lubricated gear and are mounted by bearings (10) in a gear casing (5) enclosing the gear. To separate the lubricating oil from the compressed oxygen and to produce properties which are favourable in terms of rotor dynamics, the rotor shafts (8) are additionally mounted by bearings (18) in a retaining construction. This retaining construction carries the compressor casing (15) and is arranged at a distance from the gear casing (5) and so as to be separated from the latter by ambient air.

<CLAIMS>
Gear compressor with one or more compressor stages (1 to 4) each surrounded by
a respective compressor housing (15), wherein each compressor stage (1 to 4) comprises

a rotor shaft (8) and each rotor shaft (8) carries a pinion (7) and at at least one end a rotor
(9), which rotates in a respective one of the compressor housings (15), wherein each rotor

shaft (8) is driven by an integrated, oil-lubricated gear and is borne by an oil-lubricated
bearing (10) in a gear housing (5) enclosing the gear, wherein each rotor shaft (8) is

additionally borne by a bearing (18) in a holding construction, to which the compressor
housings (15 are fastened and which is arranged at a spacing from the gear housing (5),

characterised thereby that for the compression of oxygen the rotor shaft (8) is sealed
within the compressor housing (15) and at the passage through the gear housing (5)

relative to the external atmosphere and that an intermediate space able to be flowed
through by ambient air is formed between the holding construction and the gear housing

(5).
Gear compressor according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the additional
bearing (18) is lubricated by a lubricant compatible with oxygen.
Gear compressor according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the additional
bearing (18) is a magnetic bearing.
Gear compressor according to claim 3, characterised thereby that each
compressor stage (1 to 4) has in the hub part a cone safety bearing (19) which is axially

displaceable to such an extent that the rotor (9) is guided free of play in the case of failure
of the magnetic bearing.
Gear compressor according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that
each rotor shaft (8) is borne by two oil-lubricated bearings (10, 26) in the gear housing (5)

and that the additional bearing (18) is constructed as a guiding and damping bearing.
Gear compressor according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that a
rotor shaft (8) carries two rotors (9) and that a magnetic bearing is arranged behind each

rotor (9).
