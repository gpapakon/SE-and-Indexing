<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a radio frequency filter, comprising a block(1) 
of a dielectric agent and an insulation sheet (2) attached to a side surface 

thereof. From the top surface of the block to the undersurface, at least two 
holes (3,4,5) coated with a conductive agent extend. At least most of the 

surface of the body, with the exception of one side surface, as well as the 
surfaces of the holes have been coated with a conductive agent, whereby a 

transmission line resonator is produced for each hole. The surface of the 
insulation sheet (2) fixed against the uncoated side surface but not facing the 

block has also been coated with a conductive agent. The coupling pattern 
formed by the metallic electrodes is located between the opposite surfaces. 

The unevenness of the surfaces placed against each other and the defects in 
adjusting the pieces cause great divergence in the response curves of the 

filters. This can be reduced in that prior to attaching the insulation sheet (2) 
part (14,15,16,17,115) of the electrodes of the coupling pattern have been 

arranged on the uncoated side surface of the insulation sheet (2) and the rest 
(7,8,9, 10,11, 12,13,114) of the electrodes of the coupling pattern have 

been arranged on the other side surface of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radio frequency filters of the type comprising
a block of dielectric matter and an insulation sheet. The surfaces of the block
comprise a top surface and bottom surface on the opposite sides, two
opposite side surfaces limited to said surfaces, and the opposite two end surfaces.
From the top surface of the block to the bottom surface at least two
holes extend, coated with a conductive material. At least the main part of the
surface of the body, with the exception of one side surface, has been coated
with a conductive layer, whereby a transmission line resonator is produced
for each hole. The insulation sheet has been attached against the uncoated
side surface, the surface of which not facing the block is coated with a
conductive layer.Known in the art are such dielectric, usually ceramic filters which have been
coated all over, with the exception of the top surface, with an electrically
conductive material. When the coating of a coated hole is connected with the
coating of the bottom surface, the hole has been short circuited at that point.
Since the top surface, at least in the vicinity of the hole, is uncoated, the hole
is open at this end. The structure forms now a quarter-wave transmission line
resonator. When conducting an electromagnetic wave into the structure, at
a given frequency, i.e. at the resonant frequency, a standing wave in the
direction of the hole is produced. The maximum of the capacitive field thereof
is placed at the open end of the hole, whereas the maximum of the inductive
field is placed at the short circuited hole. If on the uncoated top surface
various conductive patterns are placed, both the resonant frequency of an
individual resonator and the coupling between the resonators can be affected.
By positioning a conductive pad adjacent to the open end of the furthermost
resonators of the block, and insulated from the coating of the side of the
block, a signal can be carried into the resonator by being capacitively coupled 
with the resonator, and out therefrom likewise by capacitive coupling. Since
between the coating of the open top end of the resonator and the coating of
the top side edge of the ceramic block is a given capacitance value, said
capacitance can be changed by adding some coating to the proximity of the
top side hole,said coating being in connection with the coating of the side, or
by adding some coating on the top side in connection with the coating of the
hole. This is one manner in which the resonant frequency is affected. With
