<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle transmission shifter (1) in which a 
locking member (24) is movable along a line in opposite 

directions to a locked position or unlocked position. A 
mechanical advantage means, preferably a toggle joint 

(32), is connected to one end of the locking member for 
either restraining or moving the locking member in 

response to the energization of an electrical coil (35) 
of an electrical module (30) which actuates an armature 

(37), or so-called module actuator, in a direction 
orthogonal to the toggle joint. The module actuator is 

biased to substantially align the axes of the toggle 
joint in which position the locking member is in locked 

position restrained from movement. When the brake of the 
vehicle is applied, the coil is energized and the module 

actuator is moved by the energization of the coil to 
break the knee of the toggle joint to unlock the locking 

member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a locking 
mechanism for controlling the shifting of a lever for an 
automatic transmission, and more particularly, to such a 
locking mechanism for locking the shift lever in a park 
position against rotation to other gear positions. More 
specifically, this invention relates to a locking 
mechanism which is responsive to a condition of a vehicle 
such as the application of the brakes of an automotive 
vehicle. In vehicles which are equipped with automatic 
transmissions, the shifting lever is movable from a park 
position to other gear positions such as reverse, 
neutral, drive, second gear, and first gear. The 
shifting lever is generally associated with a detent 
plate and a detent pawl for releasably holding the lever 
in the park position and an actuator means is provided 
for the driver to actuate the pawl to release the 
shifting lever for movement by the driver to the other 
gear positions. Problems have been encountered in the unintended 
acceleration of a vehicle in shifting from the park 
position to the other gear positions. Therefore, efforts 
have been made to prevent the shifting of the shifting 
lever until the brake pedal has been depressed so that 
the vehicle does not move before it is intended by the 
driver. US-A-5 096 033 describes an electrically operated 
control module mounted on a detent plate and having a pin 
movable between a distended position to an extended 
position. This control module is controlled by the 
application or non-application of the brakes of the 
vehicle in which the shifter is mounted. When the brakes  
 
are not applied, the pin is urged to an extended position 
which prevents a lockout arm from being moved by the 
actuation of the pawl actuator and, accordingly, the pin 
when extended prevents the shifting of the shift lever. 
However, when the pin is distended by applying the 
brakes, it is located out of the path of the lockout arm 
permitting the actuation of the pawl and the shifting of 
the shift lever from park position to the other gear 
positions. Many other types of lockout mechanisms have been 
devised. One such suggested mechanism was to mount an 
electrically operated control module having a pin movable 
between a distended position to an extended position on 
the tube of a shifter lever. In such mechanism, the pin 
was movable in response to the energization of the coil 
of the module to an extended position and into the path 
of a pawl actuator. The pin actually was an armature 
forced by the magnetic

locking member (24) is urged to said locked position and 

when the vehicle is in the second condition, said locking 
member is urged to the unlocked position; characterised
