<ABSTRACT>
A riser cyclone separator (20) is positioned external to 
the containment vessel (50). The riser cyclone separator 

discharges separated catalyst to a catalyst stripper (51) and 
separated vapor to a plenum (40), both positioned internal to 

the containment vessel. Means (28) is provided for withdrawing 
stripping gas from the catalyst stripper and passing it 

via the riser cyclone separator to the plenum. The riser 
cyclone separator is inherently pressure stable relative 

to the containment vessel. The invention is particularly 
useful for retrofitting a direct-connected riser cyclone 

separator to a preexisting containment vessel with space 
limitations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cyclone separator apparatus
attached directly to a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) riser
reactor.US-A-5248411 describes an apparatus for
rapidly separating catalyst from a cracked hydrocarbon gas in a
fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. It also describes a
process for withdrawing stripper gas from an FCC reactor vessel.
A vent orifice for withdrawal of reactor and stripper gasses is
located in an annular space formed around the riser cyclone
outlet tube and the roof of the riser cyclone. The vent orifice
provides pressure stability in a direct-coupled cyclone system.The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process comprises
mixing hot regenerated catalyst with a hydrocarbon feedstock in a
transfer line riser reactor under catalytic cracking reaction
conditions. The feedstock is cracked to yield gasoline boiling
range hydrocarbon as well as degradation products, such as coke,
which deposits on the catalyst causing a reduction in catalytic
activity. Hydrocarbon vapor and coked catalyst are passed from 
the top of the riser reactor to a containment vessel, containing
a cyclone separator, wherein catalyst is separated from
hydrocarbon. In the art, the separator vessel is termed the
reactor vessel or the disengager vessel. The separated catalyst
is passed to a stripper, also in the containment vessel, and
contacted with a stripping gas to remove volatile hydrocarbon.
Stripped catalyst is then passed to a separate regeneration
vessel wherein coke is removed from the catalyst by oxidation at
a controlled rate. Catalyst, substantially freed of coke, is
collected in a vertically oriented regenerated catalyst
standpipe. The regenerated catalyst is passed from the standpipe
to the riser reactor for cyclic reuse in the process.A conventional fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) feedstock
comprises any of the hydrocarbon fractions known to yield a
liquid fuel boiling range fraction. These feedstocks include
light and heavy gas oils, diesel, atmospheric residuum, vacuum
residuum, naphtha such as low grade naphtha, coker gasoline,
visbreaker gasoline and like fractions from steam cracking.Catalyst development has improved the fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC) process. High activity, selectivity and feedstock
sensitivity are demonstrated by the new crystalline zeolite
cracking catalysts. These high activity catalysts have been used
to improve the yield of more desirable products. The hydrocarbon conversion catalyst employed in a fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC) process is preferably a high activity
crystal
