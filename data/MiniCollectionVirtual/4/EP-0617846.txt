<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a battery heating device with a temperature sensor and at least one heating element in a liquid and acid-proof arrangement inside the battery. The heating element is a power transistor (10) secured to a cooling plate which can be powered by the battery, the emitter of which is powered by a temperature control circuit (34) when the battery temperature falls below a predetermined reference temperature and the battery voltage is higher than a lower threshold and lower than a higher threshold. A trigger circuit is fitted which responds to the rise in the battery voltage after the current in a user with a high current consumption has been switched off. The trigger circuit actuates a time circuit (100) which conductively controls the power transistor (10) for a set time if the battery voltage is under or at the lower threshold.
