<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cationic 
electrodepositable coating composition which is capable of 
forming a coating film having a high chipping resistance and 
corrosion resistance. In the field of motor vehicles, there has been an 
increasing need in recent years for improving the durability 
of automotive outer plates in a corrosive environment (e.g. 
roads sprinkled with rock salts in a cold climate). To meet 
the need, corrosion-resistant, galvanized steel panels 
have been increasingly used as automotive body panels to 
replace the cold-rolled steel panels conventionally used. On the other hand, automobiles running on a road are 
frequently exposed to high velocity flying debris such as 
rock salt particles, and pebbles. The collisions of debris 
with the coated substrate cause the paint to chip away at 
the point of impact, thereby exposing the underlying 
substrate. That is, a problem of so-called "chipping" is 
posed in this way. The coatings on automotive bodies become 
so hard and less elastic under a low-temperature environment 
as in a cold climate that the coatings are directly 
subjected by collision with debris to an impact with 
substantially no alleviation. As a result, coatings tend to 
peel off between the steel substrate and the layer formed by 
chemical conversion and between the steel substrate and the  
 
zinc layer. Currently an urgent demand has arisen for 
measures against the chipping problem under a low-temperature 
environment. To resolve the chipping problem, a coating method has 
been proposed which comprises coating a substrate with an 
electrodepositable coating composition, and coating the 
coated substrate with a chipping sealer to form a coating 
having a low static glass transition temperature, followed 
by conventional application of intermediate and top coating 
compositions (e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 
No.65,765/1987 (JP-A-62 65 765)). However, the thickness of the chipping 
sealer coating is preferably in the range of 3 to 10 Âµm, 
since a low thickness fails to impart satisfactory chipping 
resistance to the coating, and a high thickness is likely to 
afford a poor finish appearance. Moreover, the spray 
coating method conventionally used makes it difficult to 
control the application of sealer to such small thickness, 
thereby raising a problem on application of the chipping 
sealer on a mass production scale. The additional procedure 
of applying the chipping sealer is disadvantageous from the 
viewpoint of procedure saving and is
