<DESCRIPTION>
 RADIO FREQUENCY RANGING APPARATUSThe present invention concerns radio frequency ranging apparatus. The invention is particularly applicable to radio frequency ranging apparatus used as radio positioning apparatus, e.g. as a navigational aid. However, the invention also has application in other forms of ranging apparatus, such as radar, in which the propagation time of radio signals is used to obtain a range and/or a position. In radio positioning systems, the position of a receiver relative to a number of transmitters is determined. In radar systems, the positions of the transmitter and receiver are generally known (usually the same) and the radio signal propagation time is employed to determine the range of a reflecting target.In radio positioning systems, spread-spectrum (SS) are known and used particularly to reduce interference between the transmitters of the radio positioning system and other users of the radio frequency spectrum. Spread-spectrum techniques permit the power spectral density (psd) to be kept low whilst maintaining sufficient total power in the transmitted signal for adequate reception.In some systems, such as radar, the radio signals can be transmitted as short pulses of radio frequency energy, but this is an inefficient method of ensuring adequate mean power, and also generates high levels of interference. For radio positioning systems, a commonly employed technique is to measure the phase on reception of unmodulated continuous wave (CW) narrow band carrier. Systems employing this technique include the navigation systems called Omega and Hyper-Fix. A problem with CW systems is that a receiver cannot distinguish between 

multiples of 2Ï€ in phase. In addition, the use of CW does not permit discrimination between the wanted signal propagated via the direct path between transmitter and receiver, and interference propagated by other paths, such as the so called "sky wave" signal reflected by the ionosphere.More recently, spread-spectrum techniques have been introduced for radio positioning and current examples include Geoloc, Syledis and Spot. In spread-spectrum techniques for radio positioning employed hitherto, a carrier wave is phase angle modulated by a digital code sequence. The digital code sequence is typically a pseudorandom noise (PN) code. In a PN code, the individual elements of the binary code sequence are known as chips, and the frequency of these code elements is known as the chip rate. A particular PN code has a predetermined number of chips before the code sequence
