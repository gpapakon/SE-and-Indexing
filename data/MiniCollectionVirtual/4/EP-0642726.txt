<ABSTRACT>
A container (10) for food includes a paper-based substrate (30), and at least one grease and moisture resistant coating (28) applied in liquid form to the paper-based substrate (30). The liquid coating (28) is preferably formed from an aqueous-based dispersion of acrylic-based material. The liquid coating (28) remains resistant to grease and moisture issuing from food at temperature in the range of about -20  DEG F to 425  DEG F.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
copending patent application Serial No. 07/889,461, filed
on May 27, 1992, the contents of which are hereby
incorporated by reference.The present invention relates generally to the
field of paper-based food containers, and more
particularly to frozen food trays, ice cream containers,
gable top containers, beverage cups, food cartons and the
like having press-applied coatings thereon.Paper-based food containers have customarily
been formed from paperboard extruded with wax or a
polymer layer, such as polyethylene, polypropylene or
polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Additional coatings
have been developed for, among other things, rendering
the food cartons resistant to grease and moisture and for
preventing ink-printed graphic designs from leaching into
the food contained therein. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,595,611 to Quick
et al. discloses an ink-printed ovenable food container
comprising a layer of ink printed on the food contact
side of a paperboard substrate and a layer of polyester
resin atop the ink for preventing the ink from migrating
into the food. U.S. Patent No. 4,463,029 to Nishijima et
al. describes a baking tray sheet which is heat resistant
and may be used in both microwave and conventional ovens.
The baking tray sheet has a base of paper or cardboard
coated with a layer composed of polyvinyl alcohol and/or
starch and a water-resisting agent. Atop this layer is
an additional coating of silicone. U.S. Patent No.
4,469,258 to Wright et al. discloses a tray formed from
paperboard or plastic. The paperboard tray may have
extruded thereon PET, polypropylene, acrylics or hot melt
materials to render the tray resistant to water, oils and
fats. U.S. Patent No. 4,418,119 to Morrow et al.
discloses an ovenable board formed from paper or
paperboard and coated with a layer of polyvinyl alcohol
and a silicone. U.S. Patent No. 4,456,164 to Foster et
al. describes an ovenable container having a base of
molded pulp or pressed paperboard having a layer of
polymeric material bonded thereto in a secondary process.Due to the relative expense of polymeric
material, polymer-extruded paperboard food containers as
described above are undesirably costly to fabricate.
Additionally, because of the polymers extruded onto the 
paper material, these food cartons are not readily
recyclable.It is, therefore, an object of the present
invention to provide a food container having a paperboard
base with liquid coatings press-applied thereon.It is another object of the present
