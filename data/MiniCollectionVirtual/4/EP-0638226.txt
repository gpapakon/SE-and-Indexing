<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The drainage systems contained in liquid-manure pits consist essentially of plates which are from time to time cleaned of solid excrement and which are kept at a distance from one another. Plastic plates used hitherto cannot usually be walked on by up to two persons and, moreover, are resistant to the aggressive liquid manure to only a limited extent. The new plate is to be suitable as a drainage system in liquid-manure pits and, in particular, is to be stable and inexpensive. Furthermore, a new liquid-manure pit containing such a plate is to be provided. 2.2 Suitable polyolefine hollow-chamber plates having two boom plates kept separated at a distance from one another by vertical webs are characterised in that an oblique web is arranged between two adjacent vertical webs. Liquid-manure pits according to the invention, into which solid and liquid manure falls, have an intermediate drainage floor formed from at least one polyolefine hollow-chamber plate. 2.3 Intermediate drainage floor in liquid-manure pits, particular for the mass rearing of livestock.
