<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for separating a blood 
material into leukocyte-removed blood component 

products, which comprises providing a multiple blood 
bag system comprising a primary bag (5) containing a blood 

material, a leukocyte-removing filter device comprising 
a flat casing, and at least one satellite bag (6), and 

centrifuging the blood material using a centrifuge cup (4) 
having the multiple blood bag system accommodated 

therein, to thereby separate the blood material into 
blood components, wherein the centrifugation is performed 

with the filter device being held by a filter 
device holder (1) having a substantially flat dimension 

which is disposed in a centrifuge cup so as to extend 
in a direction perpendicular to an inner bottom floor 

of the centrifuge cup, and wherein the filter device 
holder has a recess (2) and the filter device is received 

by the recess in a manner such that a flat surface of 
the flat casing of the filter device is perpendicular 

to the inner bottom floor of the centrifuge cup. By 
the method of the present invention, not only can the 

accommodation of a multiple blood bag system into a 
centrifuge cup be readily performed without any additional 

cumbersome operations, but also the danger of 
damaging the filter device and the blood bags is extremely 

reduced or eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
separating a blood material into blood component
products. More particularly, the present invention is
concerned with a method for separating a blood material
into leukocyte-removed blood component products, which
comprises providing a multiple blood bag system comprising
a primary bag containing a blood material, a
leukocyte-removing filter device comprising a flat
casing, and at least one satellite bag, and centrifuging
the blood material or a leukocyte-removed blood
product obtained from the blood material, using a
centrifuge cup having the multiple blood bag system
accommodated therein, to thereby separate the blood
material or leukocyte-removed blood product into blood
components, wherein the centrifugation is performed
with the filter device being held by a filter device
holder having a substantially flat dimension, which
extends in a direction perpendicular to an inner bottom
floor of the centrifuge cup and is retained between
blood bags of the multiple blood bag system or between
a blood bag of the multiple blood bag system and an
inner side wall of the centrifuge cup, and wherein the
filter device holder has a recess and the filter device 
is received by the recess in a manner such that a flat
surface of the flat casing of the filter device is
perpendicular to the inner bottom floor of the centrifuge
cup. By the method of the present invention, the
filter device of the multiple blood bag system can be
accommodated readily, fittedly and stably into a centrifuge
cup together with the blood bags in a compact
fashion without the need for using an adhesive tape, so
that the accommodation of a multiple blood bag system
into a centrifuge cup can be readily performed without
any additional cumbersome operations. Further, since
during the centrifugation, the flat filter device is
stably retained in the centrifuge cup in a state received
by the recess of the filter device holder extending
in a direction perpendicular to the inner
bottom floor of the centrifuge cup, the danger of
damaging the filter device and the blood bags is extremely
reduced or eliminated.In recent years, in accordance with the progress
of immunology and study of transfusion, it has become
apparent that side effects of transfusion are caused by
the leukocytes contained in a blood material used for
transfusion. Side effects of transfusion include not
only relatively mild side effects, such as headache, 
nausea, chilliness and nonhemolytic febrile transfusion
reactions, but also serious side

A method for separating a blood material into
leukocyte-removed blood component products, which

comprises:

(1) providing a multiple blood bag system comprising a
primary bag containing a blood material, a leukocyte-removing

filter device fluid-tightly connected to an
outlet of said primary bag through a tube and at least

one satellite bag fluid-tightly connected to an outlet
of said filter device through a tube,

   said filter device comprising a flat casing (9) having
a blood inlet (7) and a blood outlet (8), and a filter material (10)

disposed in said casing and communicated on one side
thereof to said blood inlet (7) and on the other side

thereof to said blood outlet (8), and
(2) in either order,

(a) centrifuging the blood material or a leukocyte-removed
blood product obtained in step (b) from

the blood material, using a centrifuge cup having said
multiple blood bag system accommodated therein, to

separate said blood material or leukocyte-removed blood
product into blood components, and
(b) filtering leukocytes from the blood material
or a blood component separated in step (a) from the

blood material, using said filter device of the multiple 
blood bag system, to obtain a leukocyte-removed

blood product,

   wherein in step (a), the centrifugation is performed
with said filter device (3) of the multiple blood

bag system being held by a filter device holder (1) having
a substantially flat dimension which is disposed in

said centrifuge cup (4) in a manner such that a plane of
the filter device holder which extends along said

substantially flat dimension is perpendicular to an
inner bottom floor of the centrifuge cup and that the

filter device holder is retained between blood bags of
said multiple blood bag system or between a blood bag

of said multiple blood bag system and an inner side
wall of said centrifuge cup,

   said filter device holder having a recess (2) substantially
conforming to the shape of the flat casing of

said filter device,

   said filter device being received by the recess (2) of
said filter device holder in a manner such that a flat

surface of the flat casing of the filter device is
perpendicular to said inner bottom floor of the centrifuge

cup.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said
recess is located in an upper portion of said filter 

device holder.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said
filter device has on the flat casing a projection

and/or an angular portion and said filter device holder
has a portio
n thereof covering said projection and/or
angular portion.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said
filter device holder is made of an elastic material at

least at a portion of said holder which contacts said
filter device.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said
multiple blood bag system is placed in a centrifuge

inner cup having an inner bottom floor, and said inner
cup having said multiple blood bag system placed therein

is entirely accommodated in said centrifuge cup, so
that said multiple blood bag system is indirectly

accommodated in said centrifuge cup through said centrifuge
inner cup.
