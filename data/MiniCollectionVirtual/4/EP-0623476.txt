<ABSTRACT>
A heat transfer sheet (dye doner sheet) comprises a base 
sheet, and a heat transfer layer formed on the base sheet. 

The heat transfer layer comprises a binder and a dye having 
the following chemical formula: 


   (Foron Brilliant Yellow S - 6 GL)
 

Second and third heat transfer layers, formed adjacent to 
said heat transfer layer, may comprise a binder and 

respectively the dye C.I. Disperse Red 60 and the dye C.I. 
Solvent Blue 63.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet material, more 
particularly to a heat transfer sheet for carrying out heat 
printing in accordance with image information by means of 
thermal heads or the like. Heretofore, a heat-sensitive color-producing paper 
has been primarily used to obtain an image in accordance with 
image information by means of the contact type dot-shaped 
heating means such as thermal heads or the like. In this 
heat-sensitive color-producing paper, a leuco dye which is 
colorless or pale-coloured at room temperature and a 
developer provided on a base paper are contacted by the 
application of heat to obtain a developed color image. 
Phenolic compounds, derivatives of zinc salicylate, rosins 
and the like are generally used as such a developer. 
However, the heat-sensitive color-producing paper as 
described above has a serious drawback in that its color 
disappears when the resulting developed color image is stored 
for a long period of time. Further, color printing is 
restricted to two colors, and thus it is impossible to obtain 
a color image having a continuous gradation. On the other hand, a heat-sensitive transfer sheet 
wherein a heat-fusing wax layer having a pigment dispersed 
therein is provided on a base paper has been recently used. 
When this heat-sensitive transfer sheet is laminated with a 
paper to be heat transfer printed, and then heat printing is 
carried out from the back of the heat-sensitive transfer 
sheet, the wax layer containing the pigment is transferred 
onto the heat  
 
transferable paper to produce an image. According to 
this printing process, an image having durability can be 
obtained, and a multi-color image can be obtained by 
using a heat-sensitive transfer paper each containing 
three primary color pigments and printing it many times. 
However, it is impossible to obtain an image having an 
essentially continuous gradation as in a photograph. In recent years, there has been a growing demand for 
obtaining an image like a color photograph directly from 
an electrical signal, and a variety of attempts have been 
made to meet this demand. One of such attempts provides 
a process wherein an image is projected onto a cathode-ray 
tube (CRT), and a photograph is taken with a silver 
salt film. However, when the silver salt film is an 
instant film, the running cost is disadvantageously high. 
When the silver salt film is a 35 mm film, the image 
cannot be instantly obtained because it is necessary to 
carry out a development treatment after the 
photographin
