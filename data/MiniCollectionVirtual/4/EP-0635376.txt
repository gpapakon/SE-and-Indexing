<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an information 
processing apparatus having an information processing 

section for recording information on a sheet member (P) or 
reading information therefrom. The information processing 

apparatus further has a platen (19) disposed in the information 
processing section, a head member (5a) disposed opposite to the 

platen (19) in the information processing section so as to record 
information on the sheet member (P) or reading information 

therefrom, a conveyance mechanism for conveying the sheet 
member while passing it through the information processing 

section, and a conveyance passage displacement mechanism for 
displacing a conveyance passage for the sheet member by 

reciprocating between the platen side of the conveyance 
passage and the head member side thereof, the moving amount 

of the conveyance passage displacement mechanism being 
variable. The present invention thus can provides an 

information processing apparatus which can maintain a 
predetermined distance between the sheet member (P) and the head 

member (5a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
processing apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1,
and particularly to an information
processing apparats in which a sheet member is conveyed at a
suitable distance between the sheet member and a head
member.In recent years, a note-type personal computer which is
convenient for carrying and storage has widely been
popularized with miniaturization of personal computers.
This is accompanied by increase in the demand for
miniaturization of a recording apparatus connected to a
personal computer.In a small recording apparatus, since each of parts is
disposed in a limited space, parts having a low degree of
importance are omitted as much as possible, leaving a
minimum number of necessary parts alone. For example, a
mechanism for conveying paper is constructed in a simple
form comprising several rollers, gears and paper guides, and
is operated in the state most parts other than the printing 
portion is outside the device. In such an apparatus, since
printing is hardly performed in a large amount at a time, a
feed tray and a delivery tray are omitted or provided in an
insufficient size from the viewpoint of the space.A conventional known recording apparatus has the
configuration shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, reference
numeral 1 denotes a frame body of the recording apparatus,
which is divided into two parts, i.e., a first housing 2 and
a second housing 3. Both housings 2 and 3 are rotatably
connected to each other by a hinge 4. Fig. 1 shows the
working state wherein the first housing 2 is raised at 90Â°
with respect to the second housing 3. In the first housing
2 are disposed an ink jet cartridge (IJC) 5 as recording
means, and a conveyance roller 9 for conveying recording
paper to the cartridge 5. The IJC 5 roughly comprises an
ink jet recording head 5a and an ink tank 5b for supplying
necessary ink to the head 5a, and is mounted on a carriage 8
which is slidably provided on a pair of parallel rails 7.
The parallel rails 7 are disposed in the direction at right
angles to a paper conveyance passage which will be described
below. The conveyance roller 9 which forms a main passage
of the paper conveyance passage is arranged near the IJC 5.
In the vicinity of the periphery of the conveyance roller 9,
a first pinch roller 10 is arranged near the IJC 5, and a
second pinch roller 11 is arranged near the second housing 3 
at a distance from the IJC 5. A conveyance guide 12 is
arranged between both pinch rollers 10 and 11 along the
periphery of the conveyance roller
