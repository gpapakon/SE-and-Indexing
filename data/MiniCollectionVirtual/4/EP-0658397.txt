<ABSTRACT>
In a welding device for motor vehicle bodies there are 
provided a number of pairs of locating gates (4, 5) 

adapted to operate on different models of body. In the 
work position, each pair of locating gates (4, 5) can 

be selectively coupled to a plurality of auxiliary 
fixtures (4a, 4b, 4c; 5a, 5b, 5c) depending upon the 

specific version (for example hatchback, sedan, 
station-wagon) of the model of body to be welded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for spot
welding of structures constituted by sheet metal
elements, particularly motor-vehicle bodies, of the
type comprising:
a welding station, provided with programmable
means for automatic welding,a line for feeding loosely preassembled
structures to be welded in sequence to the welding
station,two or more pairs of locating gates provided at
the welding station in such a way as to be rapidly
interchangeable at a work position, said locating gates
carrying devices for clamping the elements forming the
structure to be welded in the correct mutual assembling
position, the gates of each pair being provided with
clamping devices adapted to a respective type of
structure to be welded, said pairs of locating gates being displaceable
on both sides of said line, at the welding station,
between rest positions and a work position, so that
they are rapidly interchangeable at the work position,
the gates of each pair being further movable
transversely to said line, when they are at said work
position, between inoperative spaced apart positions
and operative relatively close positions, in which said
clamping devices are able to engage the structure which
is at the welding station.  The applicant has been producing welding devices
having the above indicated features for a long time
(see for example US patent No. 4.256.947 and German
patent No. 2.810.822). Such welding systems, marketed
under the trade mark "ROBOGATE" have produced a 
turnaround in the technique of spot welding of motor-vehicle
bodies. The ROBOGATE system has found extensive
application among various car manufacturers throughout
the world, due to a number of important advantages with
respect to the systems used previously (see also US-A-5 191 958).Firstly, the system is provided with a high degree
of flexibility, i.e. it is able to operate on bodies
which are even very different from each other, so that
a same line can be used for the production of different
models.Secondly, the system can be adapted with relatively
simple and quick operations, and therefore with very
low costs, to the production of a new model of body.Another advantage lies in that a uniform quality on
all the models of a same type on which the system
operates is ensured.In the ROBOGATE system of the most classic type
(see the above cited prior patents) said locating gates
carrying the clamping devices are slidably mounted
longitudinally of the line, on both sides thereof. Each
pair of locating gates is provided, as indicated above,
with

Device for spot welding of structures constituted
by sheet metal elements, in particular motor-vehicle

bodies, comprising:

a welding station (1), provided with
programmable means for automatic welding (R),
a line (3) for feeding loosely preassembled
structures to be welded (2A, 2B, 2C) in sequence to the

welding station (1),
two or more pairs of locating gates (4, 5)
provided at the welding station (1) in such a way as to

be rapidly interchangeable at a work position, said
locating gates carrying devices for clamping the

elements forming the structure to be welded in the
correct mutual assembling position, the gates of each

pair being provided with clamping devices (18) adapted
to a respective type of structure to be welded,
said pair of gates (4, 5) being displaceable on
both sides of said line (3) at the welding station (1)

between rest positions (B, C) and a work position (A),
so as to be rapidly interchangeable at the work

position (A), said gates (4, 5) of each pair being
further displaceable transversely to the line (3), when

they are at the work position (A), between inoperative
spaced apart positions and operative close position, in

which the clamping devices (18) engage the structure

which is at the welding station,

characterized in that
for each pair of locating gates (4, 5), a plurality of

auxiliary fixtures (4a, 4b, 4c; 5a, 5b, 5c) are
provided, which are selectively engageable with the

respective same pair of locating gates (4,5), said auxiliary
fixtures being movable

along said line (3) independently from the locating
gates (4, 5), so that a selected auxiliary fixture can

be rapidly brought into the welding station (1), when
the respective pair of locating gates (4, 5) is at its

work position (A), and can be coupled to said 
respective locating gates (4, 5), said auxiliary

fixtures being provided with means for coupling to
respective locating gates and having clamping devices

(15) which are respectively adapted to engage different
parts of different versions of a same model of body for

which said respective pair of locating gates (4, 5) are
provided.
Device according to claim 1, in which the locating
gates (4, 5) are slidably longitudinally mounted on

both sides of said line (3), characterized in that said
auxiliary fixtures (4a, 4b, 4c; 5a, 5b, 5c) are

slidably longitudinally mounted above said conveyor
line.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that
it comprises a lifting device (20) adjacent to the work

position (A) able to pick up an auxiliary fixture (4a,
4b, 4c; 5a, 5b, 5c) and bring same into a position for

coupling to the respective pair of locating gates (4,
5).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that
the locating gates (4, 5) and the auxiliary fixtures

(4a, 4b, 4c; 5a, 5b, 5c) are provided with plug-and-socket
coupling means (25) for their respective

coupling.
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that
there is provided an upper conveyor line (19) for the

auxiliary fixtures (4a, 4b, 4c; 5a, 5b, 5c) and that
said lifting device (20) has an upper support (21)

fixed to a support frame (11) of the welding station
(1) and a lower support (22) connected to the upper

support (21) by pantograph means (23) so that it can be
displaced between a raised position at the level of the

upper conveyor line (19) and a lower position for
coupling the picked up auxiliary fixture to the

respective pair of locating gates.
