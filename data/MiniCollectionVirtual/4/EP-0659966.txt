<ABSTRACT>
A central locking system for a plurality of active functional units and/or passive components of a motor vehicle is provided with a signal input device for locking and unlocking blocking elements which are coupled to the functional units and/or the system components and respond to the input signal. The signal input device (1) comprises a signal generator (2) which can be activated from the outside and a data processing unit (3). The data processing unit (3) is coupled to the functional units and/or system components (9) via a serial interface (6) and a bus line (7). The functional unit and/or system components (9) each have a transmitting/receiving component which can be actuated by the input signal and each have a decoding and driving stage for the implemented blocking element, so that the functional units and/or system components can be enabled or locked as a function of an input signal which has been detected as acceptable. An additional signal transmitter (4) is present which outputs an additional signal, it also being possible for the additional signal to be read into the data processing unit (3).

Central locking system for a plurality of separate
different active functional units or passive

mechanical components (9) of a motor vehicle,
comprising a signal input device (1), which generates

a main signal, for locking and unlocking electrical
and/or mechanical blocking elements, which are coupled

to the functional units and/or the mechanical
components (9) and respond to an input signal

corresponding to the respective main signal, wherein

a) the signal input device (1) comprises an
externally actuable signal generator (2) and a

data processing unit (3),
b) the data processing unit (3) is coupled by a
signal line (7) to the functional units and/or

the mechanical components (9),
c) the functional units and/or mechanical components
(9) comprise one receiving part, which is

actuable by the input signal, as well as one
decoding and triggering module for each

implemented blocking element,
d) the signal line takes the form of a serial bus
cable (7),
e1) in combination with electrical functional units
(9) as electrical blocking elements devices are

provided, which in the locking state interrupt
the circuit for the functional unit, and
e2) in combination with the mechanical components (9)
as mechanical blocking elements mechanical

devices are provided for locking and unlocking,
wherein both the electrical and the mechanical

blocking elements are kept de-energized in the
locking state and in the unlocking state,
characterized in that

an additional signal generator (4) is provided, which,
when the central locking system is ready for

operation, continually emits an additional signal,
wherein the emitted additional signal is receivable 

also by receivers optionally situated outside of the
motor vehicle and wherein the emitted additional

signal is readable into the data processing unit (3)
in such a way that unlocking is effected and/or

maintained only given undisturbed emission of the
additional signal.
Central locking system according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the signal strength of the additional signal is
readable into the data processing unit (3).
Central locking system according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the signal generator (2) is actuable via a key-operated
switch, an input keypad, a magnetic card

reader or the like.
Central locking system according to one of claims 1 to
3,
characterized in that

the bus cable (7) is designed as an electrical signal
line or an optical signal line.
Central locking system according to one of the
preceding claims,
characterized in that

a third signal, which is emitted by a transmitter
independent of the central locking system, is readable

into the data processing unit (3).
Central locking system according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the additional signal is usable for the deduction of
road tolls.
