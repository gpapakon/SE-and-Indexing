<ABSTRACT>
A structure 1 produced by extrusion, such as a plastics foam sheet, a board, a profiled element or the like, contains at least 10 % by volume of open cells 2, 4, which have a polyhedral shape and adjoin one another. By using an increased temperature in extrusion, in comparison with the extrusion of closed-cell thermoplastic structures, the deformation-free opening of the cells is brought about. In that case, webs 3 of cell walls 5, 6 remain unaffected in their shape, whether they have openings 7 or no passages, so that mechanial strength of the cell framework or of the three-dimensional matrix is preserved.
