<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (1) for polishing a notch (32) on the 
periphery of a wafer (W) comprises:

 
   a table (2) for supporting the wafer;

 
   buff (7), adapted 
to polish the notch, which is 
rotatable about a first axis substantially parallel to the 

surface of the wafer;
 

   means (8) for rotating the buff;
 

   means (9) for supporting the buff;
 

   means (10) for adjusting the pressure applied by the 
buff to the notch; and

 
   means (4,4a,5,6) for rotating the table about a second 

axis which is substantially parallel to the first axis, so 
that the applied pressure acts on the bottom wall of the 

wafer, in the notch, in a direction substantially 
perpendicular to the surface of said bottom wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polishing apparatus
for a notch portion formed on the periphery of a wafer
(hereinafter, which is simply called "a polishing apparatus")
which is used for positioning adjustment or crystal
orientation adjustment of the wafer.Generally, a photolithographic technique is used for the
purpose of forming a pattern for a semiconductor integrated
circuit in a single crystal of Si, compound semiconductor or
the like (hereinafter, which is simply called "a wafer").
Such an application of the photolithographic technique
requires a precise positioning adjustment and a precise
crystal orientation adjustment. For these requirement, a
linear portion is generally made on one side of the periphery
of the wafer in order to use the linear portion as a standard
for the positioning adjustment and the crystal orientation
adjustment. This linear portion of the wafer is called an
orientation flat.When such an orientation flat is formed on the wafer, a
portion of the periphery of the wafer is cut off linearly.
Therefore, the area of the cut portion of the wafer is large,
so the number of semiconductor chips which can be obtained
from a wafer decrease. As a result, according to such a 
conventional method in which an orientation flat is formed on
a wafer, it is impossible to effectively utilize an expensive
wafer. The conventional method has another problem in that it
is difficult to treat wafers when each of the wafers has a
large diameter and an orientation flat, so the wafers are not
properly in balance, for example, on a work using a spin dryer
or the like in which the wafers are dried by a centrifugal
force due to a high speed rotation.Recently, in order to solve the above problems, another
method has been used in which a small notch having a circular
arc shape or a shape of a character "V" in plan view is formed
in a portion of the periphery of each wafer. In this method,
positioning and crystal orientation adjustments of the wafer
are carried out by using the notch.Such a notch is formed by using a grinding wheel 31 or
the like, as shown in FIG. 3. That is, the notch portion 32
is formed by making the grinding wheel 31 press into a portion
of the periphery of the wafer W and by grinding the portion,
as shown in the plan view of FIG. 4. FIG. 5 is a vertically
cross-sectional view showing the wafer W cut along the line 5-5
of FIG. 4. The wall of the wafer W in the notch portion 32
swells into a curve toward the outside in the middle of
vertical direction, as shown in this Figure. A

periphery of a wafer (W) comprising:


a table (2) for supporting the wafer;
a buff (7), adapted to polish the notch, which is
rotatable about a first axis substantially parallel to the

surface of the wafer;
means (8) for rotating the buff;
means (10) for adjusting the pressure applied by the
buff to the notch; and
means (4,4a,5,6) for rotating the table about a second
axis which is substantially parallel to the first axis, so

that the applied pressure acts on the bottom wall of the
wafer, in the notch, in a direction substantially

perpendicular to the surface of said bottom wall.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the table can
be reciprocally rotated around its centre, e.g. by a pulse

motor (3), within a predetermined small angle, so that
side-walls of the notch can be polished by the buff.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, which
additionally comprises a vacuum system adapted to hold the

wafer on the table.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the means for rotating the table about the second axis

comprises a crank (4) having a pair of crankshafts (4a) of
which one is preferably connected to a pulse motor (6) and

the other is supported by a bearing (5).
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the second axis passes through the notch.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the buff is supported by means (9) comprising an elongate

member (92) hingedly mounted towards its centre on a fixed
member (91).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein the buff and
the pressure-adjusting means (10) are disposed at opposite

ends of the elongate member. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the pressure-adjusting means comprises a cylinder device

(10), e.g. an air cylinder device or a hydraulic cylinder
device.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the periphery of the buff has a section that is almost the

same shape as the shape of the notch in plan.
