<ABSTRACT>
Injection molding apparatus for hot tip gating 
wherein a torpedo (46) is screwed into a threaded seat (74) in the 

forward end of a nozzle (10). The torpedo (46) has an elongated 
shaft (80) with a pointed tip (88) mounted centrally in an outer 

collar (82) by a pair of spiral blades (84) which impart a swirling 
motion to the melt flowing to the gate (14). The temperature of 

the melt in the gate varies according to a continuous 
thermodynamic cycle in the torpedo. A thermocouple bore (112) 

extends radially inward through the outer collar (82) and one of 
the spiral blades (84) to a conductive inner portion (92) of the 

central shaft (80) of the torpedo (46). The thermocouple bore (112) is 
positioned whereby a thermocouple element (116) extends radially 

outward from it into an insulative air space (68) between the 
forward end (52) of the nozzle and the mold. The thermocouple 

element (116) has a substantially 90 degree rearward bend (118) a 
predetermined distance from its inner end. The bend (118) abuts 

against a tapered portion (122) of the inner surface (70) of 
the well (62) 

in which the nozzle (10) is seated to securely retain the 
thermocouple element (116) against the inner end (114) of the 

thermocouple bore (112). This accurate location and reliable 
retention of the thermocouple element (116) in place provides the 

accurate monitoring of the melt temperature necessary for 
its control throughout the thermodynamic cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hot tip gated injection 
molding apparatus comprising a heated nozzle and a torpedo to 
convey melt to a gate, the nozzle having an outer surface, a 
rear end, a forward end and a melt bore extending 
longitudinally therethrough from the rear end to the forward 
end, the melt bore having an enlarged portion extending to the 
forward end to form a seat, the nozzle to be seated in a well 
having an inner surface in a mold with an insulative air space 
extending between the outer surface of the nozzle and the inner 
surface of the well in the mold, the torpedo having an outer 
collar with a central opening therethrough, an elongated shaft 
with a forward tip extending centrally through the central 
opening, and at least one blade portion extending between the 
central shaft and the outer collar, the outer collar having a 
cylindrical rear portion and a cylindrical forward portion, the 
cylindrical rear portion of the outer collar being removably 
received in a seat around the melt bore and the cylindrical 
forward portion of the outer collar being received in a 
circular opening in the mold, whereby the outer collar bridges 
the insulative air space extending between the nozzle and the 
mold, the central opening through the outer collar aligns with 
the melt bore through the nozzle, and the forward tip of the 
central shaft of the torpedo extends in alignment with the 
gate, the elongated central shaft of the torpedo having a 
highly heat conductive metal inner portion and an integral wear 
resistant outer portion, and a thermocouple element associated 
with said torpedo.  
 Both heated nozzles and probes are used to 
provide hot tip gating for injection molding. The 
difference between a nozzle and a probe is that the melt 
flows through a nozzle but around a probe. The increasing 
demand for more and more highly temperature sensitive 
materials has made it even more critical to monitor melt 
temperature as accurately as possible. U.S. Patent Number 
4,820,147 to Gellert which issued April 11, 1989 relates to 
heated probes and shows inserting a thermocouple wire 
radially into one of the probe locating pins to monitor the 
melt temperature. More recently, Mold-Masters Limited 
Canadian Patent Application Serial Number 2,059,060-0 filed 
January 20, 1992 entitled "Injection Molding Probe with 
Coaxial Thermocouple Sleeve and Heating Element" shows the 
thermocouple wire extending centrally in the probe. Thus 
the thermocouple is centrally located in the melt flow
