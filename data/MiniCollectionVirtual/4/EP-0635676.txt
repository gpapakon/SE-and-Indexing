<ABSTRACT>
In a method and a burner for the combustion of liquid or gaseous fuels, a considerable portion of the fuel is fed to an area lying downstream of a baffle plate (17) and adjoining the inner wall of the burner tube. Exhaust gases located in the combustion chamber are fed back by internal exhaust-gas recirculation into vacuum zones built up downstream of the baffle plate (17), and guide devices (25, 27; 29) piercing the burner tube (1) and projecting into the vacuum zones are used for this purpose.

Process for low-pollutant, in particular low-NO
x
 
combustion of liquid or gaseous fuels in furnaces having 

a burner projecting into a combustion chamber (3) of a 
boiler (5), the burner pipe (1) of which burner having at 

least one fuel nozzle (15; 15') arranged therein for 
supplying the fuel and a baffle plate (17) connecting 

thereto, in which: 

a) a considerable part of the fuel is supplied to a 
region lying downstream of the baffle plate (17) and 

adjoining the internal wall of the burner pipe, 
b) waste gases situated in the combustion chamber are 
returned by internal recirculation in negative pressure 

regions in the burner pipe (1) formed downstream of the 
baffle plate (17), wherein one or more conduit devices 

(27, 25; 29) breaching the burner pipe (1) and projecting 
into the negative pressure regions are used for this. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the conduit devices (27, 25; 29) are used as baffle 

and/or swirl surfaces for the flow. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the supplied quantity of fuel is 

controlled as a function of the capacity of the burner. 
Burner, in particular for carrying out the process 
according to one of the preceding claims, having a burner 

pipe (1) projecting into a combustion chamber (3) of a 
boiler (5), at least one fuel nozzle (15; 15') arranged 

therein for supplying the fuel and a baffle plate (17) 
connecting thereto, wherein:  

 

a) the fuel nozzles (15; 15') are arranged in the burner 
pipe (1) such that a considerable part of the fuel is 

supplied to a region situated downstream of the baffle 
plate (17) and adjoining the internal wall of the burner 

pipe, and 
b) one or more waste gas conduit devices (25, 27; 29) 
breaching the burner pipe (1) lead to negative pressure 

regions in the burner pipe (1) formed downstream of the 
baffle plate (17) such that they return waste gases 

situated in the combustion chamber (3) by internal 
recirculation to the negative pressure regions. 
Burner according to claim 4, characterised in that at 
least one fuel nozzle (15), in particular fuel gas 

nozzle, is introduced as far as the internal wall of the 
burner pipe. 
Burner according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
fuel nozzle (15) blows the fuel in the axial direction 

along the internal wall of the burner pipe. 
Burner according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in 
that the fuel nozzle (15) blows the fuel radially against 

the internal wall of the burner pipe. 
Burner according to one of claims 4 to 7,
 
characterised in that the conduit devices (25, 27; 29) 

with flowing fuel are arranged to be distributed evenly 
over the periphery of the burner pipe (1) and are 

designed as baffle and/or swirl surfaces. 
Burner according to one of claims 4 to 8,
 
characterised in that the conduit devices (25, 27; 29) 

are designed as pipe pieces (29).  
 
Burner according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the pipe piece mouth projects into a flow region of the 

fuel-combustion air mixture lying downstream of the 
baffle plate (17) and adjoining the internal wall of the 

burner pipe. 
Burner according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the pipe pieces (29) are arranged against the burner pipe 

wall at an angle such that the pipe piece mouth lies 
downstream of the pipe piece entrance. 
Burner according to one of claims 4 to 8,
 
characterised in that the conduit devices (25, 27; 29) 

comprise in each case an opening (25) in the burner pipe 
wall serving for waste gas circulation and a deflecting 

plate (27) projecting into the burner pipe (1) from the 
upstream limiting edge (31) of the opening. 
Burner according to claim 12, characterised in that 
the deflecting plates (27) project into the flow region 

of the fuel-combustion air mixture lying downstream of 
the baffle plate (17) and adjoining the internal wall of 

the burner pipe. 
Burner according to claim 12 or 13, characterised in 
that the deflecting plates (27) have a polygonal and/or 

curved, in particular delta-wing-shaped outline. 
Burner according to one of claims 12 to 14,
 
characterised in that one or more deflecting plates (27) 

are designed in each case as a wall section cut free from 
the burner pipe wall and then bent inwards. 
Burner according to one of claims 4 to 15,
 
characterised in that back-suction deflectors (28) are 

arranged on the outer wall of the burner pipe (1)  
 

downstream of the waste gas return openings (25), in 
order to prevent recirculation of waste gases with too 

high a non-combusted portion through the waste gas return 
openings (25) . 
Burner according to one of claims 4 to 16,
 
characterised in that flow pipes are introduced into the 

chamber situated radially outside the burner pipe (1) 
from the entrance openings (25) of the waste gas-conduit 

devices (25, 27; 29), such that waste gases can be 
recirculated from preset points in the combustion chamber 

(3).
