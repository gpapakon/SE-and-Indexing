<ABSTRACT>
Nonaqueous gelled automatic dishwashing compositions 
containing a mixture of a protease enzyme and an amylase enzyme 

have been found to be very useful in the removal of protein and 
carbohydrate soils from dishware at operating temperatures of 

100°F to 140°F.

<DESCRIPTION>
It has been found to be very useful to have enzymes in 
dishwashing detergent compositions because enzymes are very 
effective in removing food soils from the surface of glasses, 
dishes, pots, pans and eating utensils. The enzymes attack 
these materials while other components of the detergent will 
effect other aspects of the cleaning action. However, in order  
 
for the enzymes to be highly effective, the composition must be 
chemically stable, and it must maintain an effective activity at 
the operating temperature of the automatic dishwasher. chemical 
stability is the property whereby the detergent composition 
containing enzymes does not undergo any significant degradation 
during storage. This is also known as shelf life. Activity is 
the property of maintaining enzyme activity during usage. From 
the time that a detergent is packaged until it is used by the 
customer, it must remain stable. Furthermore, during customer 
usage of the dishwashing detergent, it must retain its activity. 
Unless the enzymes in the detergent are maintained in a suitable 
environment, the enzymes will suffer a degradation during 
storage which will result in a product that will have a 
decreased initial activity. When enzymes are a part of the 
detergent composition, it has been found that the initial free 
water content of the composition should be as low a level as 
possible, and this low water content must be maintained during 
storage, since water will activate the enzymes. This activation 
will cause a decrease in the initial activity of the detergent 
composition. After the detergent container is opened, the detergent will 
be exposed to the environment which contains moisture. During 
each instance that the detergent is exposed to the environment 
it could possibly absorb some moisture. This absorption occurs 
by components of the detergent composition absorbing moisture, 
when in contact with the atmosphere. This effect is increased 
as the container is emptied since there will be a greater volume 
of air in contact with the detergent, and thus more available 
moisture to be absorbed by the detergent composition. This will 
usually accelerate the decrease in the activity of the detergent 
composition. The most efficient way to prevent a significant 
decrease in this activity is to start with an initial high  
 
activity of enzyme and to use components in the dishwashing 
composition which have a low hygroscopicity and a low alkalinity 
which will minimize any losses in activity as the detergent is 
being
