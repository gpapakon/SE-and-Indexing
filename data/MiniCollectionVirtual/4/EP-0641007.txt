<ABSTRACT>
A direct heating type-cathode structure is provided with filaments (200) 
which are secured to at least three points on the side surfaces of a porous 

pellet (100) formed of tungsten or molybdenum, and the cathode material 
thereof includes an alkaline earth metal oxide of barium. The thus-structured 

direct-heating-type cathode structure requires a temperature of only 950°C to 
980°C to obtain the current density of 10A/cm² and is su
itable for use in a 
color cathode ray tube and specifically in wide-screen televisions and 

industrial cathode ray tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct-heating-type dispenser cathode 
structure, and more particularly, to a direct-heating-type dispenser cathode 
structure of an electron gun for use in a color cathode ray tube where rapid 
thermion emission is possible. A cathode emits thermions by thermal energy and is largely divided 
into two types. One is an indirect-heating type in which indirect heating is 
used, which has a separated filament and thermion emission source. Another 
is a direct-heating type in which direct heating is used, which has a connected 
filament and thermion emission source. In general, an indirect-heating-type cathode is applied to an electron 
gun which needs a large amount of thermions. Examples of such include an 
oxide cathode and a dispenser cathode. The indirect-heating-type cathode 
comprises a sleeve in which a filament is provided, and a base metal or a 
cathode material reservoir fixed onto the sleeve. The base metal is mainly 
applied to an oxide cathode while the reservoir is applied to a dispenser 
cathode. A direct-heating-type cathode is applied to an electron gun for use in a 
small cathode ray tube, like the viewfinder of a video camera, and generally 
comprises a base metal or a medium for carrying cathode material which is to 
be directly fixed to the filament. In general, cathode material is deposited on  
 
the surface of the base metal, and the cathode material carrying media can be 
applied to large or industrial cathode ray tubes which require a large amount 
of current. A porous pellet impregnated with a dispenser-type cathode 
material is an example of the carrying medium. A U.S. patent application (filed September 14, 1993) based on Korea 
Patent Application No. 91-9461 (by the present Applicant) discloses a 
structure in which a porous pellet is directly fixed onto a filament and is as 
shown in FIG.1 of the accompanying drawings. Referring to FIG.1, filament 
2 is directly secured to both sides of a porous pellet 1 which contains cathode 
material. Filament 2 is directly secured to the side of pellet 1 as shown in 
FIG. 2 of the accompanying drawings, and filament 2' is buried in the body 
of porous pellet 1 as shown in FIG. 3 of the accompanying drawings. The porous pellet of the conventional direct-heating-type dispenser 
cathode structure is directly heated by the filament which is directly secured 
to the body of a pellet, and directly emits heat by the filament current. 
Therefore, it takes a very short time to start thermion emission after current
