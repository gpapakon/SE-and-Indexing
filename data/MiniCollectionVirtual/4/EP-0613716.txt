<ABSTRACT>
A gas transfer apparatus (12) readily adapted for 
oxygenating blood includes a housing (14) with a hollow internal 

chamber (36) having a fiber mat (34) consisting of two sets of 
intermingled hollow fibers with one set (66) of fibers having 

micropores formed in the walls thereof and the other set (68) 
having solid liquid impermeable walls. The housing (14) for the 

apparatus is designed such that the blood being processed 
passes substantially uniformly across the entire cross 

section of the fiber mat (34) whereby a treating gas such as 
oxygen being directed through the microporous fibers can be 

diffused into the oxygen deficient blood while excess CO₂ in 
the blood can cross diffuse into the interior of the fiber 

and be removed from the apparatus. Simultaneously with the 
cross diffusion of gas between the microporous fibers and 

the blood, a thermal conducting fluid such as water is 
passed through the solid walled fibers to maintain or 

regulate the temperature of the blood in the apparatus. 
The microporous and solid walled fibers may be woven in 

layers (66,68) which are laminated to form a predetermined mat 
thickness separated by layers with only parallel fibers of 

a single set in each layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas transfer 
apparatus according to the precharacterizing portion of 
claim 1 (which is based on US-A-5 137 531). In the late 1970s, technology was developed to allow 
the extrusion of very thin hollow tubes from polymeric 
materials. Additional benefits of this technology allowed 
for the creation of a multiplicity of micropores within the 
wall of such tubing. Such microporous hollow fibers (MHF) 
were soon readily adapted for use in extracorporeal blood 
oxygenators, serving as the membranous element separating 
blood from the gaseous phase, in order to minimize the 
blood trauma experienced when blood is directly fixed with 
gases. Predating the development of MHF, blood oxygenators 
had been constructed so as to directly mix gaseous oxygen 
with the blood to achieve the necessary gas transfer. As 
previously stated, this resulted in significant blood 
trauma and necessitated the subsequent defoaming of the 
blood/gas mixture prior to return of the blood to the 
patient's arterial circulation. A significant incidence of 
patient pathology, such as gaseous embolization and 
silicone defoaming agent embolization to the brain and 
other major organs, when utilizing such bubble oxygenators  
 
led early investigators to develop a potentially safer 
device called a membrane oxygenator. Early membrane oxygenator designs utilized flat sheets 
of membranous material (usually thin silicone rubber 
sheets) to separate the alternating blood and gas channels 
of the device. The membrane material was arranged in 
either a flat stack, referred to as a flat plate oxygenator 
or as a continuous coil around a central core, referred to 
as a spiral coil oxygenator. Blood was allowed to flow 
within the channel between two opposing membrane layers, 
while gaseous oxygen flowed within the adjacent channels on 
the other side of the membrane sheets. The necessary 
transfer of oxygen molecules into the blood and the 
simultaneous removal of carbon dioxide molecules from the 
blood was by passive diffusion and was limited by the 
chemical solubility of the gases in the membrane material. 
While many of these early devices were functional, and were 
utilized clinically, they were relatively inefficient gas 
transfer devices requiring large membrane surface areas to 
provide adequate gas exchange. An additional problem with 
the earlier designs was the necessary compression and/or 
membrane tension required to keep the membranes from 
bulging apart during active blood flow. Such bulging
