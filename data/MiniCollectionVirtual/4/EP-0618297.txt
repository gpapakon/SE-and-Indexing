<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collection of novel bacterial shuttle cloning 
vectors aimed to assist recombinant DNA manipulations in a wide variety of 
actinomycetes, including the microorganism Streptomycesavermitilis. Many pharmaceutical products are produced by microorganisms. Microbial 
participation in the formation of useful products can be divided into three categories 
based on how much of the key genetic information needed to make the actual chemical 
structure of the product is present in the microorganism. The first category consists of 
those products that are natural metabolites, such as antibiotics, all the information for 
their synthesis being native to the cell. The second category includes those products 
that are not natural metabolites of microorganisms but the microorganism contributes 
information for biological steps used in the chemical conversion of chemicals from one 
form to another. This is termed bioconversion (for example, the bioconversion of 
steroids). The third category is characterized by the fact that the information that 
defines the structure of the product molecule is not initially found in the genome of the 
microorganism. In this case, the information is inserted into the cell. Production of 
compounds in all three categories has been or will be influenced by recombinant DNA 
technology. Among those microorganisms with industrial applications, the soil-inhabiting 
actinomycetes play a central role, and have been recognized as an important 
source of antibiotics and other biologically important compounds. Streptomyces, one of the main genera of the order Actinomycetales, have 
received substantial attention. Members of the genus Streptomyces are gram-positive 
soil bacteria. Analysis of innumerable isolates from soil samples have yielded more 
than 90% of the therapeutically useful antibiotics. There is a great deal of industrial 
experience regarding the growth and handling of actinomycetes over the four decades 
in which actinomycetes fermentations have been used to produce antibiotics. 
Additionally, because of interest in improving antibiotic production, genetic studies in 
actinomycetes are advancing. Actinomycetes are the focus of efforts in developing 
recombinant DNA cloning techniques in order to isolate antibiotic biosynthetic genes, 
generate novel derivatives or hybrid compounds, isolate regulatory genes, and  
 
investigate the regulatory mechanisms involved in both primary and secondary 
metabolisms. While much has been learned about
