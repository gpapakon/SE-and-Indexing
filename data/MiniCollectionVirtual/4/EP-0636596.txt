<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a ceramic sintered body 
comprising: adding 70-45% by volume of water as a 

solvent to 30-55% by volume in total of ceramic powder 
and powder of sintering aids; stirring the resultant 

mixture to form a slurry; deflocculating flocculation 
of powders with substantially no grinding of the 

powders by means of causing a high-speed shear flow 
and/or a high-speed contraction flow in the slurry to 

thereby mix the slurry until the powders are dispersed 
with the maximum particle diameter equal to or smaller 

than that of the unmixed starting powders; forming a 
molded compact from the slurry; and sintering the 

molded compact to produce a ceramic sintered body. 
The forgoing production process is carried out using a 

device comprising a mixing trough stirring blades and, 
in a part of the mixing trough having or in a slurry 

circulation conduit communicated with the mixing 
trough, a slurry mi
xing unit for deflocculating 
flocculation of powders with substantially no grinding 

of powders by means of causing a high-speed shear flow 
and/or a high-speed contraction flow in the slurry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process and a device
for producing a ceramic sintered body such as silicon
nitride, etc.Sintered bodies of ceramics, such as silicon
nitride, silicon carbide, or alumina, are produced
through a process comprising steps of mixing of
starting powders, molding, and sintering it by using a
powder metallurgy technique. In particular, sintered
bodies of silicon nitride are widely used as materials
for cutting tools or structural materials because of
their high strength and toughness as well as superior
thermal shock resistance and wear resistance. In
recent years, ceramic sintered bodies of high quality
have been desired that offer an improved strength with
less variations in strength as application thereof to
parts of an internal combustion engine of a vehicle.In the production process for these ceramic
sintered bodies, a grinder such as a ball mill is
typically used to mix starting powders. Wet mixing is
commonly used with a solvent such as alcohol to form a
more uniform mixture. The slurry obtained as a result
of the wet mixing is typically granulated by means of
spray drying and is then molded through dry pressing
and sintered. Alternatively, other available methods
used in practice include injection with an addition of 
a large amount of plasticizer to granulated powder and
wet molding to mold the slurry simultaneously with
dehydration thereof by means of cast molding or the
like.The mixing method with a conventional grinder
such as a ball mill imparts shock, friction, and
shearing force to the starting powders by means of
falling, colliding or rolling balls, rods, or pebbles
in mixing, which causes the flocculation to be
deflocculated or destroyed while the starting powders
are ground. The starting powders are thus
progressively dispersed in the solvent. In
particular, pulverization of the starting powders by
grinding is used positively as an approach to improve
the strength of the sintered body in producing silicon
nitride sintered bodies of high quality with a high
strength. The imparted energies are, however,
expended on motion or friction of a ground medium.
This deteriorates the efficiency of mixing of the
powders or dispersion thereof into the solvent, which
is a primary object of grinding. Accordingly, a long
time is inevitably required for mixing.In addition, grinding of the starting powders in
mixing will cause the variation in the particle
diameter and the particle size distribution of the
powders, depending on the mixing lot or mixing
condition. This directly
