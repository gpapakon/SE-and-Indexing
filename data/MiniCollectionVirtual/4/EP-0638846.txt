<ABSTRACT>
An automatic developing machine is proposed which is 
more compact. The treating tank (2) communicates with the 

sub-tank (3) through a return passage (4) and a supply passage (5). In 
the latter passage, a pump (6) is provided to circulate a 

treating solution through the treating tank (2) and the sub-tank (3). 
To the supply passage (5), a tablet supply unit (8) is 

connected which supplies tablets containing components for 
treating photographic materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic developing 
machine for developing photosensitive materials such as 
exposed films or printed photographic paper. An automatic developing machine for developing 
photosensitive materials such as films and photographic 
paper have treating tanks filled with different treating 
solutions such as developing, bleaching, fixing and 
stabilizing solutions. Photosensitive materials are fed 
through these solutions in the treating tanks for 
development, bleaching and other treatments. As shown in Fig. 5, a conventional means for storing 
such a treating solution is typically made up of a treating 
tank 21 and a sub-tank 22 communicating with the treating 
tank 21 through a return passage 23 and a supply passage 
24. To maintain the activity of the treating solution, it 
is circulated between the treating tank 21 and the sub-tank 
22 by means of a circulation pump 25 provided in the supply 
passage 24. The concentration of a treating solution changes with 
the amount of photosensitive materials treated. If the 
concentration is too low, it is impossible to treat 
photosensitive materials properly. Thus, it is necessary  
 
to adjust the concentration according to the change. One conventional method of adjusting the 
concentration of the solution in the treating tank is to 
store a solution having a predetermined concentration in 
the sub-tank. But it takes a substantial time to prepare 
such a solution having a predetermined concentration. Such 
a solution has to be stored in an extra tank provided in 
the developing machine. This increases the size of the 
developing machine. To solve these problems, International Patent 
Publication WO 92/20013 proposes to supply a solid treating 
agent containing components necessary for the treatment of 
photosensitive materials into the sub-tank and dissolve it 
in the solution to adjust its concentration. This type of automatic developing machine has a 
supply unit 26 for supplying a solid treating agent. Since 
it is mounted over the sub-tank 22 as shown in Fig. 5, the 
developing machine is rather large in size. Also, gas 
produced from the treating solution in the sub-tank 22 
tends to rise and invade the supply unit 26. On contact 
with such gas, a plurality of small pieces of treating 
agent tend to stick together, forming larger lumps. This 
makes it difficult to supply a predetermined amount of 
treating agent into the sub-tank. A first object of this invention is to provide a  
 
small-sized, compact automatic developing
