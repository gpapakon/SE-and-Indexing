<ABSTRACT>
A chemical analysis film chip is prepared by 
integrally laminating a reagent layer and a spreading 

layer on a support sheet in this order, or by integrally 
laminating a water absorbing layer having a hydrophilic 

polymer as a major component and a porous outermost layer 
containing therein a reagent on a support sheet in this 

order, or by superposing a porous layer containing 
therein a reagent on a support sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chemical analysis 
film chip having a reagent layer whose optical density 
changes upon reaction with a specific biochemical 
component contained in a sample liquid such as blood or 
urine. Quantitative or qualitative analysis of a 
specific component in a sample liquid is a common 
operation carried out various industrial fields. 
Especially, quantitative analysis of a chemical component 
or a solid component contained in body fluid such as 
blood or urine is very important in the field of clinical 
biochemistry. There has been put into practice a "dry-to-the-touch" 
(to be expressed simply as "dry" hereinbelow) 
chemical analysis slide with which a specific component 
contained in a sample liquid can be quantitatively 
analyzed through a droplet of the sample liquid spotted 
onto the slide. See Japanese Patent Publication No. 
53(1978)-21677, United States Patent No. 3,992,158, 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 55(1980)-164356, 
United States Patent No. 4,292,272 or the like. 
When such a dry chemical analysis slide is used, the 
sample liquid can be analyzed more easily and more  
 
quickly than when the conventional wet analysis method is 
used, and accordingly the dry chemical analysis slide is 
very convenient for medical facilities, laboratories and 
the like where lots of sample liquids have to be 
analyzed. When chemical components or the like contained in 
a sample liquid is analyzed using such a dry chemical 
analysis slide, a droplet of the sample liquid is spotted 
onto the slide and is held at a constant temperature for 
a predetermined time (incubation) in an incubator so that 
coloring reaction occurs, and the optical density of the 
color formed by the coloring reaction is optically 
measured. That is, measuring light containing a 
wavelength which is pre-selected according to the 
combination of the component to be analyzed and the 
reagent contained in the reagent layer of the slide is 
projected onto the slide and the optical density of the 
slide is measured. Then the component to be analyzed is 
quantitatively analyzed on the basis of the optical 
density using a calibration curve which represents the 
relation between the concentration of the biochemical 
component and the optical density. The chemical analysis slide comprises a dry 
chemical analysis film and a plastic frame which holds 
the chemical analysis film flat to facilitate handling of 
the film during transfer. The chemical analysis film is 
generally composed of a support sheet of
