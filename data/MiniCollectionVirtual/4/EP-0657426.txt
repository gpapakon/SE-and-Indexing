 are each hydrogen, phenyl, lower alkyl or halogen;   n is 1 to 3 and   Y is O or S, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of the formula I with acids. These compounds are particularly suitable for the control or prevention of central nervous disorders, such as depressions, bipolar disorders, anxiety states, sleep and sexual disorders, psychoses, schizophrenia, migraine and other states associated with headache or pain of other types, personality disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorders, social phobias or panic attacks, organic mental disorders, mental disorders in childhood, aggressiveness, age-related memory disorders and behavioural disorders, addiction, obesity, bulimia etc.; damage to the nervous system as a result of trauma, stroke, neurodegenerative disorders etc.; cardiovascular disorders, such as high blood pressure, thrombosis, stroke etc.; and gastrointestinal disorders, such as dysfunction of the motility of the gastrointestinal tract.
