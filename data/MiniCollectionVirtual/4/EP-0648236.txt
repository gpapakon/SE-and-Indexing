<ABSTRACT>
Composite material produced from a first polyisocyanate-based mixture, from a second mixture comprising at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, at least one polyoxyalkylene polyamine and one ethylenically unsaturated polymer, and from a cross-linking catalyst. The first mixture comprises at least one polyisocyanate and at least one catalyst for reacting isocyanate functions with the ethylenically unsaturated polymer of the second mixture, and the second mixture comprises, for 100 parts by weight: 25 to 50 parts by weight of at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, 50 to 75 parts by weight of an unsaturated amine polyester resin which is the product of the reaction between (a) an unsaturated polyol polyester prepolymer and (b) a polyoxyalkylene amine, the weight ratio (a)/(b) being at least equal to 0.8, and as much as 4 parts by weight of at least one cross-linking catalyst. Application in the production of high modulus heat-resistant moulded articles.
