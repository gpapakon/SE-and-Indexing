<ABSTRACT>
A device for the mixing and metered unloading of cattle fodder or the like has a mixing chamber with a bottom, two side walls located opposite one another and an end wall extending transversely relative to the side walls, as well as at least one drivable mixing element which is mounted in the mixing chamber and extends approximately parallel to the side walls and which, during operation, covers, in the mixing chamber, a virtually closed path extending partially between and partially parallel to the side walls. A discharge orifice capable of being shut off by a shut-off member and intended for the unloading of cattle fodder is provided in at least one side wall, the path of movement of the (each) mixing element being adjacent to the bottom and the side walls and running along the discharge orifice in the (each) side wall, and, with the discharge orifice opened, the (each) mixing element, functioning as an unloading element, discharging the cattle fodder out of the discharge orifice. The mixing chamber possesses, opposite the end wall, an open introduction side for introducing the cattle fodder or the like, the (each) mixing element being adjustable along the circumference of a mixing space arranged in the mixing chamber and intended for the cattle fodder to be mixed. The mixing space is accessible via the open mixing-chamber introduction side arranged opposite the end wall, there being arranged on the open introduction side of the mixing chamber a cutting plate which is movable up and down and which has on its underside a cutting member for releasing the cattle fodder from a stock. The released cattle fodder can be introduced into the mixing space as a result of the adjustment of the cutting plate in the direction of the end wall, and the cutting plate is connected to at least one pivotably mounted pivoting arm, supported in the region of the end wall, for moving the cutting plate up and down. Furthermore, the pivoting arm is designed so as to be telescopically retractable and extensible for the purpose of adjusting the cutting plate.

Apparatus for the mixing and metered discharge of fodder or the like, having a mixing 
chamber (1) with a base (2), two facing lateral walls (3, 4) and an end wall (5) which 

extends transversely to the lateral walls, having at least one drivable mixing element (24) 
which is mounted in the mixing chamber, extends substantially parallel to the lateral 

walls and during operation describes in the mixing chamber a path which is virtually 
closed and runs partially between and partially parallel to the lateral walls, wherein in at 

least one lateral wall there is provided an outlet opening (3) for fodder discharge which 
can be closed by means of a shut-off device (31), wherein the path of motion of the 

(each) mixing element is adjacent to the base and the lateral walls and runs along the 
outlet opening in the (each) lateral wall and the (each) mixing element acts as a discharge 

element when the outlet opening is open, and wherein the mixing chamber has - opposite 
the end wall - an open introduction side for the introduction of the fodder or the like, 

wherein the (each) mixing element (24) is movable along the circumference of a mixing 
space, arranged in the mixing chamber (1), for the fodder to be mixed, wherein the 

mixing space is accessible via the mixing chamber introduction side which is open and is 
arranged opposite the end wall (5), wherein a cutting plate (15) - movable upwards and 

downwards - is arranged at the open introduction side of the mixing chamber and has at 
its underside a cutting member (16) for detaching the fodder from a supply, wherein the 

detached fodder can be introduced into the mixing space by movement of the cutting 
plate in the direction of the end wall (5) and the cutting plate is connected to at least one 

pivoted arm (13) for moving the cutting plate upwards and downwards, this pivoted arm 
(13) being pivotally mounted and being supported at the end wall, characterised in that 

the pivoted arm (13) for movement of the cutting plate (15) is telescopically retractable 
and extendible, in that the cutting plate (15) is securely connected to the pivoted arm 

(13), wherein the cutting plate (15) is movable to adjacent to the mixing space and is - at 
least during mixing - located 
in the entry plane of the mixing chamber (1) and closes the 
mixing chamber over the entire entry plane. 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that at the open introduction side, 
a storage chamber (21) for the fodder to be mixed precedes the mixing chamber (1).  

 
Apparatus in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the length of the base 
(2) between the transition parts to the lateral walls (3, 4) is less than the width of the 

cutting plate (15).
