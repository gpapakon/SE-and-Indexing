<ABSTRACT>
A fan blade comprising a body (10) having a tip end (20) and an 
in-board end (18) is configured with first (26) and second (28) fin 

portions that extend along the trailing edge (16) of the body (10) of 
the van blade. The first fin portion (26) extends from the in-board 

end (18) of the fan blade along the trailing edge (16) toward the tip 
end (20), while the second fin portion (28) extends from the tip end 

(20) of the van blade along the trailing edge (16) toward the in-board 
end (18). Both the first (26) and second (28) fin portions extend 

outwardly from the trailing edge (16) of the body at an angle to the 
trailing edge (16). A slot (30) or gap exists between the first (26) 

and second (28) fin portions and each such fin portion has a tapered 
width which narrows in the direction of the tip end (20). The width of 

the first fin portion (26) is greater than the width of the second fin 
portion (28) and the two fin portions may or may not be co-planar in 

order to optimize air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fan blades. It is known that a blade having a "twist" thereto provides more lift (and hence 
an increase in the displacement of air) than blades which are not so "twisted" or are 
uniform and consistent along their length. The most economical manner to produce aluminum fan blades is by the 
extrusion process, however, the extrusion process generally only produces non-twisted 
blades. To impart a uniform angular twist in an extruded airfoil requires 
mechanically yielding the airfoil in a secondary process. This secondary process is 
costly and it often produces inconsistent results. Consequently, it is desirable to 
combine the performance of the "twisted" blades with the economics of the uniform 
blades to achieve a high performance blade at a relatively low cost. One attempt to achieve this result is disclosed in Patent Specification 
US-A-4 618 313 which discloses an axial propeller blade comprising a single tab 
secured along its trailing edge. This single tab is also disclosed as being inclined 
from the blade at an angle of from 10° to 70° so as to enhance the lift of the blade. 
However, the tab is planar and of uniform or consistent configuration. Consequently, 
there is no possibility of this tab having one configuration and/or angle at the root end 
of the blade and another configuration and/or angle at the tip end of the blade so as 
to be more consistent with "twisted" blades. There is also no likelihood of this tab 
conforming to the multiple planes normally found in "twisted" fan blades which cause 
or result in increased performance. Patent Specification FR-A-991 183 discloses a fan blade having flaps or tabs 
articulated at the trailing edge thereof effectively to give the fan blade overall a twist. According to the invention there is provided a fan blade comprising: 
(a) a body having a tip and an end opposite the tip, the body also having a leading 
edge and a trailing edge between the tip and the end; and  (b) multiple fin means coupled to the trailing edge of the body to direct air flow  
 
across the body, the fin means comprising at least two fin portions with a first fin 
portion extending at a first angle outwardly from the trailing edge along a first length 
of the fan blade and a second fin portion extending at a second angle outwardly from 
the trailing edge along a second length of the fan blade;  
   characterised in that the first and second fin portions are formed by extrusion 
with the body of the fan blade. Such a fan blade thus incorporates a
