<ABSTRACT>
A transaction processing system comprises at least one transaction 
terminal (10, 11, 12) having means to receive characteristic data from a 

user, which characteristic data is required to generate a characteristic 
image associated with the user, such as an image of the user's signature, 

from data stored in a data processing system (14); and logic for 
generating a transaction message by combining transaction data with the 

characteristic data in such a way that the transaction data is required 
to recover the characteristic data from the message. The data processing 

system (14) comprises means to store the user data, to receive and store 
the message, to recover the characteristic data from the message using 

the transaction data, and to reconstruct the characteristic image from 
the user data using the characteristic data to establish that the 

transaction was valid by associating the characteristic image with the 
transaction data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to security in transaction processing 
systems and, more particularly, to the secure authorization of 
transactions in transaction processing systems. Examples of transaction processing systems include electronic point 
of sale (EPOS) systems allowing customers to pay for goods by means of 
credit cards or the like. Such a system includes one or more transaction 
terminals, at which details of a transaction and of a customer's card are 
entered, connected via a suitable data communications network to a data 
processing system storing, for instance, the customers' account details 
to effect a transaction in the customer's account. The fraudulent use of such systems is a serious problem which in 
1991 resulted in losses of 160 million pounds in the United Kingdom 
alone. Much effort is being invested in studying ways of addressing 
these huge losses. Currently, transactions are usually authorized by recording the 
customer's signature on paper. This is because the signing of a name by 
an individual is a dynamic action which occurs in a remarkably repeatable 
fashion. However, this traditional approach has a number of attendant 
problems. For example, it represents a tremendous burden to the 
merchant, who wants to get rid of paper, and certainly avoid the 
obligation of having to go back in his records in case of query to find a 
particular sales voucher with a signature on it. The usage of other biometrics, such as the use of fingerprint or 
voice recognition, which can be verified using suitable apparatus is 
being considered as a way of recording the fact that a customer has 
authorized a transaction. However, in some countries the matter is 
complicated by the legal need to capture the signature as evidence of the 
transaction. It is therefore desirable to use electronic copies of signatures as 
a means of allowing a customer to authorise a transaction.  However, any means of transferring signatures in electronic form, 
whether or not encrypted, yields them vulnerable unless a mechanism is 
provided for preventing an electronic signature from being associated 
with transactions other than the original that was authorised. Furthermore, if the signature associated with a transaction needs 
to be captured, electronically transmitted and stored in such a way that 
an image of the signature can be reproduced as desired, then data 
communications and storage become a significant overhead. This invention aims to improve security in transaction processing 
systems by solving these
