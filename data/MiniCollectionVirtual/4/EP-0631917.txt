<ABSTRACT>
Railway vehicle with at least two coaches 6, 11 which are connected to one another and have in each case at least one set of running gear, the ends of the coaches 6, 11 which face one another being borne by an intermediate coach 1, 9 with at least one set of running gear and being connected only to this intermediate coach 1, 9. In order to achieve an increase in the number of passengers per set of coaches with the best possible adaptation to existing railway systems and at the same time to ensure in the simplest possible way the minimum spacing necessary between coach and the edge of the platform for entering and leaving safely and to make the vehicle as balanced as possible with respect to the distribution of weight, at least one of the coaches 6, 11 is constructed as a double decker coach and at least one of the intermediate coaches 9 which adjoins the double decker coach is provided with at least one staircase 10 to one of the levels 6a, 6b, 11a, 11b of the adjoining double decker coach 6, 11.
