<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a method of manufacturing a rotation 
sensor which can effectively prevent a sensor element 

portion from movement during resin molding while forming a 
resin portion covering the sensor element part with 

excellent waterproofness and airtightness, in formation of 
the resin portion by resin molding. Resin is injected 

through a first injection step in such a state that an end 
of a bobbin (5) is fixed by a slide core (52), and 

thereafter the slide core (52) is extracted so that resin 
is again injected in a vacated portion, which is defined 

by extraction of the slide core, through a second 
injection step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a rotation sensor,
and more particularly, it relates to a
method of manufacturing a rotation sensor which is applied
to a wheel speed sensor for an automobile or the like.In general, a wheel speed sensor is known as a sensor
for detecting the wheel speed of an automobile or the
like. High airtightness is required for such a wheel
speed sensor, in consideration of the environment of its
application. In general, therefore, an internal detecting
portion (sensor element portion) of the wheel speed sensor
is inserted in a case of stainless steel or the like, and
an opening of this case is sealed with resin. This
structure is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No.
63-235811 (1988), for example. Fig. 10 is a sectional
structural diagram showing the conventional wheel speed
sensor which is disclosed in this literature. Referring
to Fig. 10, a sensor element portion which is formed by a 
magnet 102, a coil 103, a magnetic pole piece 104, a
bobbin 105 and the like is stored in a case 108 of
stainless steel or the like in this conventional wheel
speed sensor (rotation sensor). The interior of the case
108 is molded with resin by a first resin portion 109a to
a portion which is close to an opening 112 of the case
108. Both ends of a thin wire which is wound on the coil
103 are soldered to lower portions 106a of terminals 106,
while these lower portions 106a are covered with the first
resin portion 109a.A bracket 111 for fixing the rotation sensor is
bonded to an outer side of the case 108 by brazing.
Forward end portions 113 of an output wire 107 are joined
by caulking to upper portions 106b of the terminals 106.
A pipe-shaped output wire protecting member 110 is
provided around a portion of the output wire 107 which is
close to the forward end portions 113. The opening 112 of
the case 108 and the upper portions 106b of the terminals
106 are covered with a second resin portion 109b. The
second resin portion 109b is molded under a high
temperature and a high pressure, so that the opening 112,
the output wire protecting member 110 and a surface of the
bracket 111 which is close to the output wire 107 are in
close contact with the second resin portion 109b
respectively. In the conventional rotation sensor shown in Fig. 10,
however, it is difficult to reduce the product cost since
the case 108 is made of a high-priced metal such as
stainless steel.In general, therefore, there has been proposed a
system of covering the overall sensor element portion with
re

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a rotation sensor (1) including a sensor element
portion having a magnet (2), a magnetic pole piece (4), a bobbin (5) and a coil

(3), and a resin portion with a portion of small thickness and a portion of
large thickness enclosing the periphery of said sensor element portion,

said method comprising:

a step of forming said sensor element portion;
a step of inserting said sensor element portion into a resin mold (53, 54)
while bringing a bush (52) belonging to said resin mold (54) into contact with

said bobbin (5) at a position of the rear end of said bobbin (5) where the resin
portion is of large thickness;
a first injection step of injecting resin into said resin mold (53, 54) through its
injection port (55);
a step of extracting said bush (52) after said first injection step and when the
solidification of the resin portion of small thickness has progressed to such a

degree that the bobbin (5) is not displaced in the following step; and
a second injection step of injecting resin through said injection port (55) of
said resin mold (53, 54) again, while said resin injected in the first injection

step is still in a molten state in the vicinity of the rear end of said bobbin (5),
for filling up a vacated portion, being defined by extraction of said bush (52),

with said resin.
A method of manufacturing a rotation sensor in accordance
with claim 1, characterized in that said injection

port (55) of said mold (53,54) is provided
around said bush (52).
A method of manufacturing a rotation sensor in accordance
with claim 2, characterized in that said injection

port (55) of said mold (53,54) is so provided
that said bush (52) is positioned on its extension.
A method of manufacturing a rotation sensor in accordance
with claim 1, characterized in that said

bush (52) is extracted simultaneously with completion
of said first injection step.
A method of manufacturing a rotation sensor in accordance
with claim 1, characterized in that said

bush (52) is extracted after a lapse of a prescribed
time from completion of said first injection step.
