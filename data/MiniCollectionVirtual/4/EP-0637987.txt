Process for separating gas mixtures, in particular hydrocarbon gas mixtures,
which arise above liquids, with the use of a separating device exhibiting a gas

separation membrane on the retained portion side whereof there is generatable a
mixture which is impoverished as to gas (the retained portion) and on the permeate

side whereof there is generatable a mixture which is enriched as to gas (the
permeate), characterised in that the volume per unit time of the gas mixture to be

separated which arises when the liquid contacts the ambient gas during a transfer
operation of the liquid and which is supplied to the separating device as a result of a

partial vacuum on the retained portion side and the permeate side, is greater than the
volume per unit time of the liquid which is transferred during the transfer operation,

and the volume per unit time of the permeate generated is less than or equal to the
volume per unit time of the liquid which is transferred during the transfer operation,

wherein the volumes are by reference to standard temperature and pressure.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the permeate is supplied
again to a liquid store whence the liquid had been removed for the transfer operation.
Process according to one or both of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the
retained portion is discharged to the ambient atmosphere.
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
suction pressure of the gas mixture to be separated is adjustable to a predeterminable

value before entry to the separating device.
Process for separating gas mixtures, in particular hydrocarbon gas mixtures,
which arise above liquids, with the use of a separating device exhibiting a gas

separation membrane on the retained portion side whereof there is generatable a
mixture which is impoverished as to gas (the retained portion) and on the permeate

side whereof there is generatable a mixture which is enriched as to gas (the
permeate), for carrying out the process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that there are arranged on the retained portion side (14) and on the
permeate side (15), respectively, of the separating device (13) a pumping device (16)

and a pumping device (17) for generating a partial vacuum, which are adjustable such
that the volume per unit time of the gas mixture to be separated (12) which arises

when the liquid contacts the ambient gas (18) during a transfer operation of the liquid
(11) and which is supplied to the separating device (13) is greater than the volume per

unit time of the liquid (11) which is transferred during the transfer operation, and the
volume per unit time of the permeate (15) generated is less than or equal to the

volume per unit time of the liquid (11) which is transferred during the transfer
operation, wherein the volumes are by reference to standard temperature and

pressure.
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in that a control valve (21) is
arranged in a gas mixture (12) conveying line (19) from the transfer site (30) to the

separating device (13).
Apparatus according to one or both of Claims 5 or 6, characterised in that the
pumping device (17) for the permeate (15) is connected on the outlet side to a liquid

container (22).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the
retained portion (14) leaving the pumping device (16) is dischargeable to the ambient

atmosphere (18).
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised in that the pumping device (16)
for the retained portion (14) is connected to the ventilation space (23) of the liquid

container (22).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 5 to 9, characterised in that the
suction pressure of the gas mixture (12) to be separated which is supplied to the

separating device (13) is adjustable by way of a control valve (21).
