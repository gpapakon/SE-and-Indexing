<ABSTRACT>
A method for the grafting of a monomer onto a polyolefin in the presence of an organic peroxide is disclosed. The polyolefin is a polyolefin that, when molten, undergoes cross-linking in the presence of the organic peroxide. The method comprises: (a) admixing the polyolefin in an extruder with 25 to 6000 ppm, based on the weight of the polyolefin, of an organic peroxide coated onto a carrier polymer and up to 5 %, by weight of the polyolefin, of a grafting monomer capable of being grafted onto the polyolefin in the presence of the organic peroxide. The admixture is heated to a temperature above the melting point of both the polyolefin and the carrier polymer under admixing conditions to effect grafting of said grafting monomer onto the polyolefin, said carrier polymer undergoing chain scission in preference to cross-linking in the presence of the organic peroxide at said temperature. Grafted polyolefin is extruded from the extruder. The method may be used to produce grafted polyolefins with lower levels of gels and specks, especially for use in films and adhesives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the grafting of
monomers onto polyolefins in the presence of organic
peroxides, in which the organic peroxide is on a carrier
polymer that, under the grafting conditions, undergoes
chain scission in preference to cross-linking in the
presence of organic peroxides.Polymers of alpha-olefins in which the alpha-olefin
is a hydrocarbon are well known. Such polymers,
especially homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of
ethylene with the higher C4-C10 alpha-olefins are used in
large volumes for a variety of end-uses. These polymers
are relatively non-polar, which is an important and
beneficial characteristic for many end-uses. However,
non-polar characteristics are also a disadvantage, for
instance with respect to adhesion between polar materials
and the polyolefins.Properties of polyolefins may be modified by the
grafting of polar monomers onto the polyolefin. Melt
grafting processes are described in U.S. Patent 4 612 155
of R.A. Zelonka and C.S. Wong, which issued 1986
September 16. In particular, that patent describes a
grafting process in which polyolefin in particulate form
is fed to an extruder together with grafting agent and
organic peroxide, the latter being in the form of a
composition with a second polymer of lower melting point
and lower melt viscosity.In melt grafting processes, it is necessary to
obtain adequate mixing of the grafting monomer and
organic peroxide in the polyolefin prior to significant
formation of radicals upon decomposition of the organic
peroxide. If the mixing is inadequate, there is a
tendency for the polyolefin and/or grafting monomer to
undergo cross-linking reactions which form localized 
cross-linked polymer that becomes apparent as gel, black
contaminant particles or other specks in the grafted
polymer in the extruder. Both gel and black contaminant
particles or other specks are unacceptable in any
significant level for many end-uses e.g. in films.A grafting process that is less susceptible to gel
formation and speck formation has now been found.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method
for the grafting of a monomer onto a polyolefin in the
presence of an organic peroxide, said polyolefin being a
polyolefin that, when molten, undergoes cross-linking in
the presence of the organic peroxide, said method
comprising:
(a) admixing in an extruder an admixture of (i)
said polyolefin, (ii) 25 to 6000 ppm, based on the weight
of the polyolefin, of an organic peroxide coated onto a
carrier polymer, the amount of organic peroxide coated
