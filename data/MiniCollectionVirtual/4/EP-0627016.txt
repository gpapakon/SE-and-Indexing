<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cemented carbide insert with improved toughness and resistance against plastic deformation containing WC and cubic phases of carbide and/or carbonitride in a binder phase based on Co and/or Ni with a binder phase enriched surface zone. The binder phase content in the insert is 3.5-12 weight-%. In a zone below the binder phase enriched surface zone the binder phase content is 0.85-1 of the content in the inner portion of the insert and the content of cubic phases essentially constant and equal to the content in the inner portion of the insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coated cemented carbide inserts with a binder phase enriched surface zone and a process for the making of the same. More particularly the present invention relates to coated inserts in which the cemented carbide has been modified so that unique technological properties have been obtained at a given chemical composition and grain size regarding the balance between very good toughness behaviour in combination with high resistance against plastic deformation.Coated cemented carbide inserts with binder phase enriched surface zone are today used to a great extent for machining of steel and stainless materials. Thanks to the binder phase enriched surface zone an extension of the application area for the cutting tool material has been obtained.Methods or processes to make cemented carbide containing WC, cubic phase (gamma-phase) and binder phase with binder phase enriched surface zones are within the technique referred to as gradient sintering and are known through a number patents and patent applications. According to, e.g., U.S. Patents 4,277,283 and 4,610,931 nitrogen containing additions are used and sintering takes place in vacuum whereas according to U.S. Patent 4,548,786 the nitrogen is added in gas phase. Hereby in both cases, a binder phase enriched surface zone essentially depleted of cubic phase is obtained. U.S. Patent 4,830,930 describes a binder phase enrichment obtained through decarburization after the sintering whereby a binder phase enrichment is obtained which also contains cubic phase.In U.S. Patent 4,649,084 nitrogen gas is used in connection with the sintering in order to eliminate a process step and to improve the adhesion of a subsequently deposited oxide coating.From fracture mechanics point of view, an enrichment of binder metal in a surface zone means that the ability of the cemented carbide to absorb deformation and stop growing cracks increases. In this way, a material is obtained with improved ability to withstand fracture by allowing greater deformations or by preventing cracks from growing, compared to a material with mainly the same composition but homogeneous microstructure. The cutting material, thus, obtains a tougher behaviour.When gradient sintering according to the known technique of vacuum sintering of nitrogen containing cemented carbide, the nitrogen is usually added by adding of a small amount of nitrogen containing raw materials. Due to the fact that the nitrogen activity in the furnace atmosphere at the sintering is below the average
