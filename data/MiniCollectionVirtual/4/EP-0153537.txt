<ABSTRACT>
A variable speed fan drive (46), operated in response to 
the sensed coolant temperature in an internal combustion 

engine for a vehicle, blows a controlled amount of air 
through the engine's radiator (48) to maintain the coolant 

temperature in a desired narrow operating range. The air 
pulled in by the fan also cools the refrigerant flowing through 

the condenser (49) of the vehicle's air conditioning system, 
the condenser (49) being positioned in front of the coolant 

radiator (48). If insufficient condenser cooling occurs, even 
though the coolant may be adequately cooled, the refriger­

ant temperature rises and causes the compressor discharge 

pressure in the air conditioning system to increase. That 
pressure is monitored or sensed (52) and if it exceeds a 

predetermined maximum allowable level the normal opera­
tion of the control system is overridden and the fan (46) is 

driven at its maximum speed to maximize the air blown 
through the condenser (49) and radiator, (48) thereby 

decreasing the refrigerant temperature and thus the 
charge pressure.
