<ABSTRACT>
The tool has a head (1) tapering in steps to an end face (7). Each step of the head (1) has a cylindrical area (4) for calibrating a tube end (3) followed by a conical area (6) for deburring the tube end (3). Each step of the head (1) corresponds to a conventional tube size. When the head (1) is pushed into a tube end (3) to be worked, the tube end (3) is first calibrated and then deburred in one operation. By the calibrating at the cylindrical area (4), the tube end (3) is centred with respect to the longitudinal axis (11) of the head (1), which guarantees exact deburring at the conical area (6). Each conical area (6) has several cutting edges (5) which are formed by flutes (8). The tool is especially suitable for producing press joints on compound tubes.

Tool for calibrating and deburring tube ends (3), 
having at least one cylindrical region (4) for calibrating 

and at least one conical region (6) for deburring, 
characterized in that the two regions (4, 6) are arranged 

one behind the other on a head (1), such that, when the 
head (1) is introduced into a tube end (3) to be processed, 

initially the cylindrical region (4) and then the 
conical region (6) can be brought into engagement with 

the tube end (3) and the cylindrical region is intended 
here for calibrating the tube end, and in that a shoulder 

(9) is arranged behind the cylindrical region, which 
shoulder extends radially outwards and forms a stop for 

the end face of the tube end, in order to centre the 
latter and to ensure uniform deburring and a defined 

deburring depth. 
Tool according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the head (1) is of stepped design, and each step has a 

cylindrical region (4) for calibrating and a conical 
region (5) for deburring for a specific tube inner 

diameter. 
Tool according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that at least one conical region (6) has at least one 

cutting edge (5), which is formed by a flute (8, 13). 
Tool according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the flute (13) is made in the outer side of the head (1) 

and extends in the circumferential direction of the head 
(1). 
Tool according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
a plurality of radially arranged flutes (8), preferably 

four for each conical region (6), are made in the head  
 

(1). 
Tool according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the head (1) is fixed at a broad end to 

a handle (2). 
Use of the tool according to Claim 1 for calibrating 
and deburring composite tubes or plastic tubes 

for domestic installation.
