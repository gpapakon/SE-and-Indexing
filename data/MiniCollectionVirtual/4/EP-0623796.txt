<ABSTRACT>
Device for keeping a constant mutual distance between chocolate moulds (1, 2) which are made to move in a refrigerator, it being provided that the moulds (1, 2) are inserted into a receiving frame (3, 4, 5) at a fixed mutual distance (a), and it being possible for said receiving frame to be moved in vertical planes of the refrigerator via chain pulls (10-13). The receiving frames (3, 4, 5) exhibit, on their outer sides, cutouts which form sliding guides which come into operative connection with vertical, parallel rails (15, 15'), and the rails are arranged between mutually opposite ends of the moulds.
