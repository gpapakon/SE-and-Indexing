<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to friction hinges, and, more
particularly, to friction hinges for applications demanding
an angularly dependent torque.U.S. Patent No. 4,630,333 reveals a friction hinge that
is adjustable for holding a door or a lid in a particular
angular position. The adjustment permits the user to set
the hinge, within a certain range, to any desired, constant
torque.U.S. Patent No. 5,079,799, issued January
14, 1992, reveals a friction hinge capable of providing a
different, preset amount of torque for each direction of
rotation. This device has, for each direction, a band that
provides a presettable, constant slip torque that depends
upon the force applied to the tail of the band.None of the friction hinges revealed in the prior art
provides adequately for the problem of a torque requirement
that changes with the angle at which the hinge is deployed.
Such commonplace items as display cases, briefcases, and
portable computer screens have lids which can advantageously
be positioned at an angle and held there, the desired angle
varying from time to time. The torque needed to maintain
the position of such a lid varies as the cosine of the angle
between the lid and a horizontal line. If sufficient friction
is provided to position the lid just above the horizontal,
then it will be needlessly difficult to move the lid
when it is nearly vertical.The invention provides a unitized friction hinge whose
torque varies according to the deployment angle of the hinge
according to a predetermined, or preprogrammed function.
The torque can be programmed to provide deceleration near
the end of the motion of a hinged door or lid, whether the
acceleration is due to gravity or to some other force. The 
invention provides a friction hinge assembly comprising: a first hinged element
rotatably mounted on a pintle irrotatably fixed to a second hinged element; a band
helically wound about at least a portion of the pintle, the band having a first end
engageable with the first hinged element as it rotates and a second end with a tail; and
means for applying a controlled variable force to the tail that is different at different
angular orientations of the first and second hinged elements to enable controlled
tightening of the band .The invention also provides a friction hinge assembly comprising:
a first hinged element rotatably mounted on a pintle irrotatably fixed to a second
hinged element;a band helically wound about at least a portion of the pintle, the band having a
first end engageable with the first hinged
