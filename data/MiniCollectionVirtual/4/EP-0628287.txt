<ABSTRACT>
Magnetic device for the individuation of the location 
and direction of the bone perforation axis, particularly 

of the distal hole (3) of universal nails (1) utilized in 
the reduction of bone fractures, constituted by a 

cylindrical permanent magnet (11) inserted, through a guided 
support (13), into the cavity of the nail (1), until its axis is 

positioned coaxially to that of the distal hole (3), by a 
translable and rotary distal centering device (15) in touch 

with the bone surface (10) near said distal hole (3), and by a 
flat element (16) coaxial relatively to said centering 

device (15), which element is provided with three (or more) 
probes (17,17a,17b) which take the magnetic intensity of the magnet 

and are arranged at 120° to one another on a circumference, 
said three probes (17,17a,17b) being connected to a viewercomputer 

programmed to indicate the values taken by 
said probes and to calculate the mean, so as to allow 

said centering device (15) in touch with the bone, by translating 
and rotating about itself, to individuate the 

location and direction of the axis of the magnet (11) and 
therefore that of the distal hole (3) of the nail.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic device for the 
individuation of the location and direction of the axis 
of holes to be made in bones in case of reduction of 
bone fractures by driving in of protheses generally 
called universal nails or intramedulllary nails. As is known, the intramedullary nail utilized in the 
reduction of bone fractures is substantially an elongated 
and slightly arched hollow metal body, provided 
near the opposing ends with at least two transversal 
through holes, one of which is called a "proximal" 
hole, being rather near the operator who performs the 
driving in, and the other one is called a "distal" 
hole; besides, the end near the proximal hole is provided 
with a conical threading suitable to house a grip 
for driving in the nail. The distal hole is necessary to allow the correct and 
stable fastening of the nail to the bone section or 
fragment to be coupled to the bone fragment already 
fastened to said nail through a screw or a bolt inserted 
into the proximal hole. In practice, while it is rather easy to individuate, 
once the nail is inserted, the location of the proximal 
hole, and realizing therefore the corresponding hole 
through the bone in order to allow the nailing with a 
screw or the like, it is very difficult to individuate 
exactly the location and direction of the distal hole,  
 
because of the arched form and the length of the nail. The present art utilizes, for driving in the nail, an 
angled or arched grip, mounted on the proximal end of 
the nail and axially provided with a bolt on which 
axial hits are directed by means of a ram, while for 
the individuation of the location and direction of the 
distal hole, unhealthy X-ray devices are usually utilized, 
which consist of a so-called "distal centering 
device", incorporating a laying viewer and a generator 
of directional waves (known as a Trocar), which is 
pushed, throuh a cut made in the muscle enclosing the 
fracturated bone, until the surface of said bone is 
reached in a location approximately near the one of the 
distal hole of the intramedullary nail inserted. By shifting the centering device on the bone surface, 
the location of the distal round hole is indicated by 
the directional radiation emitted by the Trocar, while 
the direction of its axis is indicated through a point-centering 
device associated to the distal centering 
device upon removal of the directional trocar. Having 
individuated the distal hole, a hole is then made 
axially through the bone, in coincidence with the axis 
o

Magnetic device for the individuation of the correct 
location and direction of the axis of a hole, in particular 

of the distal hole of a universal nail driven 
into a bone according to the techniques of reduction of 

bone fractures, and constituted by an elongated and 
slightly arched hollow body, provided with a proximity 

hole, a distal hole and an inner conical threading, 
characterized in that it is constituted by a permanent 

cylindrical magnet, transversally anchored to an end of 
a bar-shaped element guidedly inserted into the existing 

cavity of the universal nail, until the geometric 
axis of said magnet is stably coxially positioned 

relatively to the axis of the distal hole (or anyhow 
fastened to the nail coaxially to the distal hole); by 

a bar-shaped cone-pointed element performing the function 
of distal centering device which is caused to 

shift until it comes in touch with the bone surface in 
the region of the distal hole to be individuated; by a 

flat element, anchored coaxially and transversally to 
said distal centering device and bearing three (or 

more) probes taking the intensity of the magnetic field 
emitted by said magnet and arranged at 120° to one 

another on a circumference; said three probes being 
connected to a viewer-computer so programmed as to 

elaborate and indicate the values of the takings of the 
three probes and to calculate the mean of said three 

 
values, so as to allow, by shifting the centering 

device on the bone surface, to position the center of 
said probe-bearing element on the axis of the magnet in 

correspondence of the maximum mean value taken, the 
coincidence o
f the axes of the distal hole and the 
magnet being determined, in case of readings of equal 

values for the three probes, while in case of three 
different values, said coincidence of the axes is 

obtained by rotating the axis of the centering device 
kept still against the bone surface, until equal values 

are obtained for the three probes. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said bar-shaped support of the magnet is fastened to 

the proxiaml end of the nail by coupling to the conical 
threading provided at the end of said nail. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said probe-bearing element is shaped as a disk or the 

like, coaxially anchored to said distal centering 
device and translable to allow several positions relatively 

to the bone surface. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it is provided, for the 

individuation of the location and direction of the axis 
of said magnet, with a flat element placed outside the 

bone, arranged perpendicularly to the geometric axis of 
said magnet and supported by an arm or the like integral 

with said support of the magnet and/or said arched 
 

grip, on which flat element at least a probe translable 
on said flat element is positioned, so as to trasmit to 

a viewer-computer three points having the same intensity 
value which define, through said computer, an isointensity 

line coinciding with a circumference, the 
magnet axis being defined and individuated by the 

direction perpendicular to said probe-bearing disk and 
passing through the center of said circumference. 
Magnetic device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it is realized to the purposes 

and for the utilizations above specified according to 
what has been described and illustrated.
