<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a container for a sample comprising a hollow body having a base, a side wall and an open end opposite the base, a closure for that body, the closure being arranged to fit to the body to close the open end thereof; and locking means for locking the closure to the body, in such fashion that the contents of the container cannot be removed without it being apparent on subsequent observation of the container. Preferably said closure is provided with a tear-off portion defined thereon by a line of weakness in the material of the closure, removal of the tear-off portion by tearing along said line of weakness allowing removal of the sample from the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container suitable for holding a sample of liquid or solid 
material in a secure aid tamper-proof manner. The invention finds particular, but not exclusive, application in the provision of a 
sample container for biological samples such as urine samples taken in drug testing 
procedures for athletes. The sample taken for such purposes is normally stored in a standard glass bottle or 
jar, having a normal sealed screw cap which is readily releasable. There is a 
requirement to secure such a sample bottle in a tamper-proof fashion so that it is not 
possible to interfere with the contents once the bottle has been closed and sealed. It 
is also desirable to provide a container for the transport of such sample bottles which 
will afford a measure of protection to the bottle against breakage in transit. WO-A-92/07770 discloses a prior art container having a hollow body, a lid portion 
for closing an open end of the body and locking means for locking the lid portion to 
the closure. Once closed with the lid portion, the container is opened by removal of 
a tear-away strip in the skirt of the lid portion which leaves the lid portion in several 
parts so that the container cannot readily be reused. US-A-4 873 193 discloses an apparatus for the collection and preservation of fluid 
biological evidence. The apparatus is adapted to receive a sample bottle or jar.  
 US-A-4 452 382 discloses a container for a liquid sample having a snap-on lid. The 
lid is extended to form a spout which is closed by a sealing wall having a peripheral 
weakened portion. The scaling wall is removable to enable the sample to be poured 
from the spout. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a container for such bottles 
which can be closed with the sample bottle inside, in a tamper-proof fashion, so that 
it is readily apparent if there has been any interference of the contents.  
 The present invention provides a container for a sample bottle having the features 
recited in claim 1. Accordingly, the closure is formed with a tear-out portion defined from the remainder 
of the closure by a line of weakness, which tear-out portion may be removed to allow 
the authorised removal of the contents of the container. Furthermore, the closure is provided with locking means which cooperates with the 
body to allow the closure to be freely positioned on the body to close the body, but 
which prevents removal of the closure from the body without damage to either the 
closure or the body.

<CLAIMS>
A container for a sample bottle (10), the container being adapted to receive the 
sample bottle and comprising a hollow body (20) having a base (21a), a side wall (21) 

and an open end (21b) opposite the base, a closure (24) for that open end (21b), said 
closure (24) comprising a central portion (40) forming an end face of the container 

when closed, and a skirt portion (23) depending from said central portion (40), and 
locking means (31,33) for locking the skirt of the closure (24) to the body (20); 

characterised in that in said central portion (40) there is provided a tear-off portion, 
being defined by a line of weakness, whereby removal of the tear-off portion (40) 

provides an aperture in said end face of said closed container and leaves said skirt 
portion (23) locked to said body (20), such that the sample bottle can be removed 

through the opening, the removal of the tear-off portion (40) thereby being apparent 
on subsequent observation of the container. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, in which said tear-off portion (40) is 
provided with a handle (43) by which it may be gripped to so tear it from said end 

face. 
A container as claimed in claim 2, in which said tear-off portion (40) is 
formed by said line of weakness (41) to have a tab (42) which extends to the 

periphery of said end face and said handle (43) is formed on said tab.  
 
A container as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said hollow body has 
an enlarged portion (22) adjacent said open end (21b) and said closure is formed with 

a skirt portion (23) arranged to fit into said enlarged portion when the closure is fitted 
to the hollow body, thus to locate the closure on the body. 
A container as claimed in claim 4, in which said closure is formed with a 
further skirt portion (27) which is arranged to engage the outer surface of said 

enlarged portion (22) when the closure is fitted to the hollow body. 
A container as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said locking means 
comprises a first series of ratchet teeth (31) formed on said hollow body (20), and a 

second series of ratchet teeth (33) formed on said closure (24), said ratchet teeth being 
arranged to cooperate to allow free fitting of the closure on the hollow body and to 

prevent subsequent removal of the closure from the hollow body. 
A container as claimed in claim 6, in which said series of ratchet teeth are 
formed over spaced portions of the peripheries of the closure and hollow body. 
A container as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7, when dependent upon claim 4, 
in which said first series of ratchet teeth are formed on the inside surface of said 

enlarged portion (22) and said second series of ratchet teeth are formed on the outside 
surface of said skirt portion (23).  

 
A container as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said closure (24) and 
said hollow body (20) are moulded integrally as one piece, connected by at least one 

bridging member (25), from synthetic plastics material. 
A combination of a container as claimed in any preceding claim, with a sample 
bottle (10), the hollow body (20) being adapted to receive the bottle. 
A combination as claimed in claim 10, in which said sample bottle (10) is 
formed with an upper necked portion (13) of smaller size than the body (11) thereof, 

and said container is provided with bottle supports (50) arranged to support the bottle 
by the base (21a) thereof with the necked portion proud of the top (21b) of the body 

of the container, thus to prevent fitting of the closure (24) to the body (20) of the 
container; and arranged to receive the necked portion of the bottle there between to 

support the bottle by a shoulder (14) between the necked portion and the body of the 
bottle with the base of the bottle within the body of the container, thus to allow the 

fitting of the closure (24) to the body (20) of the container.
