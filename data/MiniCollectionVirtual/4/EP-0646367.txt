<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer laminated blister sheet (12) has an 
impermeable intermediate layer (14) positioned between 

first and second outer layers (16, 18), each of which 
has substantially the same coefficient of thermal 

expansion. The properties of the outer layers (16, 18) 
of the blister sheet are such that there are no interlayer 

stresses that will cause curvature of the blister 
sheet when it is subjected to temperature changes 

during freezing and freeze drying steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
manufacturing and dispensing pharmaceuticals, and more 
particularly to a blister film for use in the manufacture 
and packaging of pharmaceutical tablets. Particularly, it 
relates to a laminated blister film for use in blister 
packs. In recent years, pharmaceutical producers have turned 
to the use of blister packs for use in both the forming and 
dispensing of pharmaceutical tablets. These blister packs 
generally consist of a blister sheet or blister film and a 
lidding sheet. The blister sheet contains depressions for 
containing individual dosages. In a standard process for 
manufacturing freeze dried tablets, a single dosage, in 
liquid form, is introduced into each depression of the 
blister sheet. The blister sheet, along with the liquid 
dosages, is then placed into a refrigerated environment 
where the dosages are subjected to low temperatures to 
freeze them. The blister sheets are then transferred to 
a freeze drier, where the ice is removed by sublimation. 
When freeze drying is completed, the sheets are removed 
from the drying chamber and covered with an adhesive 
lidding sheet, which seals the solid dosages into their 
individual depressions. US Patent No. 4,305,502 teaches 
interalia, a known process for manufacturing freeze dried 
tablets. Blister sheets that have heretofore been used in 
freezing and freeze drying processes have suffered from 
several deficiencies. First, the blister sheets have 
typically been made of a polymeric substance, which, over 
time, can allow moisture to permeate the blister pack and 
reach the dosages stored inside. To solve this problem, 
blister sheets have been developed in which a layer of 
aluminum is laminated between layers of polymer. While  
 
the presence of the aluminum layer prevents moisture from 
permeating the blister pack, it leads to a second problem. 
When subjected to temperature changes during the freezing 
process, conventional aluminum/polymer laminates tend to 
curl up, due to the differences in the degree of thermal 
expansion or contraction of the opposing layers of the 
laminate. This makes their use in freezing processes 
difficult, since liquid product can easily spill from the 
formed depressions or can lie unevenly in the depressions 
during filling and freezing operations. Furthermore, the 
curling of the blister sheet can cause dosages to freeze or 
sublimate unevenly, since some depressions may not be in 
physical contact with the cold surfaces of the refrigerator 
or
