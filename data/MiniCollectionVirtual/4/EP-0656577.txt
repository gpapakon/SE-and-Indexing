<ABSTRACT>
A computer (10), such as a notebook computer, can be 
upgraded to add a capability for receiving pen input data by 

the addition of an upgrade circuit module (42). Certain of 
the components necessary for the performance of this pen 

input function, such as an integrated digitizer (26) and 
display, and a portion of the circuitry for operating said 

digitizer (26) and receiving data therefrom, are 
incorporated into the computer (10) when it is manufactured 

and sold, but the pen input capability is not operable by a 
user of the computer (10) until the upgrade circuit module 

(42) is purchased and installed. An aperture (34) in the 
housing (28,30) of the computer (10) is provided to 

facilitate a simple user installation of the circuit module 
(42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a computer. The
invention has particular application to personal computers
(PCs) including so called notebook computers.PCs and particularly smaller so-called notebook
computers have come into widespread use during the past few
years. Another technological development that has come into
increasing recent use is pen computing, in which data can be
input into a computer by handwriting by a pen or stylus or a
human finger onto a screen or digitizer.European Patent Application EP-A-0 053 061 discloses a
hand-held computer comprising a peripheral frame which
contains connections into which removeable cards may be
plugged. The computer also contains a flat display screen
which is mounted on the frame and topped with a transparent
plate which forms a matrix of touch sensitive areas or
points. The screen and the plate occupy all of the upper
surface of the casing and are electrically connected to the
other circuits of the computer by contact with the frame on
which they are mounted. As such this document discloses the
use of an internal frame to electrically connect components
such as cards and the computer display.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
low cost computer which has enhanced capabilities.According to the present invention there is provided a
computer comprising a digitizer which can be engaged by a
writing device for inputting data to the computer and having
a housing and a circuit board within said housing,
characterized by a base unit coupled to said digitizer, said
circuit board having a receptacle for receiving a data input 
control circuit module, said housing having an aperture
through which said data input control circuit module can be
engaged with said receptacle; and a data input control
circuit module which, when engaged with said receptacle of
said circuit board, completes a digitizer operating data
input circuit enabling data to be input by use of a writing
device.It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a
relatively low-cost computer, such as a notebook computer,
which performs normal computing functions but does not have a
capability for receiving data by a hand-written input, and
which can be subsequently be upgraded by purchase of
additional components, to achieve such a capability.Embodiments of the present invention will now be
described, by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a prior art notebook
computer having pen input capability, partially broken
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A computer (10) comprising a digitizer (26) which can be
engaged by a writing device for inputting data to the

computer (10) and having a housing (28,30) and a circuit
board (40) within said housing (28,30), characterized by a

base unit coupled to said digitizer (26), said circuit board
(40) having a receptacle (38) for receiving a data input

control circuit module (42), said housing (28,30) having an
aperture (34) t
hrough which said data input control circuit
module (42) can be engaged with said receptacle (38); and a

data input control circuit module (42) which, when engaged
with said receptacle (38) of said circuit board (40),

completes a digitizer operating data input circuit enabling
data to be input by use of a writing device.
A computer (10) according to claim 1, housing a
cover (36) for said aperture (34) in said housing (28,30),

said cover (36) being movable to uncover said aperture (34)
for insertion or removal of said data input control circuit

module (42).
A computer (10) according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein said aperture (34) comprises a slot (60) in a side

surface (62) of said housing (28,30).
A computer according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said computer (10) is a notebook computer.
A computer according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said writing device is a stylus. 
An upgrade data input control module (42) that can be
placed into engagement with the data input control

module receptacle of a computer according to one of the
preceding claims, comprising circuitry means for

completing a digitizer operating data input circuit
enabling data to be input into the computer by use of a

writing device.
