<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of arthritis 
and to pharmaceutical compositions and usages therefor. In general, the treatment of arthritic conditions 
has been limited to symptomatic treatment, for example 
to relieve symptoms such as inflammation and pain. 
Thus, for example, it has been proposed to use so-called 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) in the 
treatment of arthritic conditions. It has also been 
proposed to use a variety of analgesics, including 
opioid analgesics, in the relief of pain in arthritic 
conditions. It has now been found, in accordance with the 
present invention, that the treatment of arthritic 
conditions with both (i) an NSAID, and (ii) an opioid 
analgesic can serve to treat the arthritic condition 
itself, that is to inhibit the arthritic process. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention 
provides the use of an NSAID together with an opioid 
analgesic in the manufacture of a medicament for the 
treatment of arthritis (both osteoarthritis and 
rheumatoid arthritis). The invention also provides a  
 
method for the treatment of arthritis by the 
administration to a patient of an NSAID together with an 
opioid analgesic. The invention further provides 
certain pharmaceutical compositions containing an NSAID 
and an opioid analgesic. The inhibition of the disease process may be 
manifested eg. by a reduction in the mean radiological 
score of a patient who has undergone or who is 
undergoing treatment in accordance with the invention. 
Other parameters which could be indicative of an 
inhibition of the arthritic disease process by treatment 
in accordance with this invention are joint diameter, 
plasma extravasation and histology. Example of NSAID's which may be used in accordance 
with the present invention include, but are not limited 
to, Diclofenac, Flurbiprofen, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin, 
Ketoprofen and Naproxen. Examples of opioid analgesics 
which may be used in accordance with the invention 
include, but are not limited to, morphine, 
hydromorphone, codeine dextropropoxyphene, oxycodone, 
hydrocodone, and dihydrocodeine, and their 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of 
particular NSAID/opioid analgesic combinations which may 
be mentioned include indomethacin/morphine, ibuprofen/ 
codeine and diclofenac/codeine.  The daily dosage rates of opioid and analgesic and 
NSAID will depend upon the nature of the particular 
active ingredients used. By way of example, for a 
combination of morphine sulphate and indomethacin, the 
morp
