<ABSTRACT>
The detector comprises:   - an elastically deformable elongated sensitive part (6), in the form of a blade or rod, arranged in a casing (1) with its two ends held essentially fixed with respect to the casing, and connected at a central point to a cord (5) so as to receive the tensile stresses in the latter, - stop means (8), forming a projection relative to the holding points (7) of the ends of the sensitive part, so as to stress the latter in permanent prestress flexion and force the central region of the sensitive part to abut against the stop means, and - electric means for detecting the deformation of the sensitive part resulting from the application to the latter, by the tensioned cord, of a stress (F) capable of causing additional flexion of this part against the permanent prestress flexion.
