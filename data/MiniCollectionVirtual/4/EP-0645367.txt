<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 
methylcyclohexane diamine wherein meta-toluenediamine is contacted with 

hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. The improvement 
resides in utilizing a hydrogenation catalyst comprising rhodium carried on 

a support and carrying out the hydrogenation in the presence of a C₃-C₁₀ 
secondary alcohol as a solvent. With the use of rhodium carried on a 

support as a catalyst, coupled with the use of the secondary alcohol 
solvent, one obtains high yields with excellent catalyst life.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the hydrogenation of 
meta-toluenediamines. The hydrogenation of aromatic amines has long been known. Typically, 
the hydrogenation involves the purification of the feed material by 
removing various isomers in the feed and/or higher oligomers, as in the 
case of bridged aromatic amines. These isomers and higher oligomers tend 
to hydrogenate slowly and many of the impurities in the feed tend to act as 
catalyst poisons. Representative patents which show the hydrogenation of 
aromatic compounds, e.g., toluenediamine and bridged aromatic amines are as 
follows: U.S. 3,636,108 discloses the process for producing aromatic nitrogen 
containing compounds such as ρ-phenylenediamine and methylenedianiline by 
reacting the aromatic compound with hydrogen at a hydrogen partial pressure 
of at least 200 psi at a temperature of from 100 to 300°C. A ruthenium 
catalyst carried on an inert support is used as the hydrogenation catalyst. 
The process can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent and 
aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents are suggested as being suited 
for the hydrogenation process. U.S. 3,450,759 discloses a process for the hydrogenation of 
toluenediamine and notes the difficulty of the reaction and the resulting 
low yields. The improved process relies on removing the o-toluenediamines 
from the feed prior to hydrogenation. Conventional metal catalysts were 
suggested as effective for the hydrogenation. U.S. 2,511,028; 2,606,924; 2,606,925; 2,606,928; 3,155,724; 
3,347,917; 3,766,272; 3,856,862 and 3,959,374 disclose various processes 
for the hydrogenation of bridged-aronmatic compounds such as 
methylene-di(aniline). In the processes numerous hydrogenation catalysts 
such as ruthenium, rhodium, and supports have been suggested for the 
hydrogenation. Many of the processes disclose the use of an alcohol as a  
 
solvent to facilitate the reaction. Representative solvents are set forth 
in the '826 patent and these include C1-8 alkanols. The '917 patent also 
discloses the use of aliphatic hydrocarbon ethers in addition to alicyclic 
and aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents and alcohols as a solvent for the 
catalytic hydrogenation of the aromatic amines. Canadian patent 892,636 discloses the hydrogenation of 
toluenediamines to produce the corresponding methane cyclohexanediamine. 
The patentees point out that a catalyst system comprising a ruthenium 
hydrogenation catalyst or an alumina supported ruthenium hydrogenation 
catalyst in combination
