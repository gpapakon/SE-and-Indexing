<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inhibitors of the amino
peptidase activity of dipeptidyl peptidase type IV (DP-IV).DP-IV is a postproline cleaving enzyme with a
specificity for removing Xaa-Pro (where Xaa represents
any amino acid) dipeptides from the amino terminus of
polypeptides. DP-IV will also remove Xaa-Ala dipeptides
from amino termini, albeit less efficiently. DP-IV is
present in many mammalian cells and tissues, for example,
renal tubule cells, intestinal epithelium, and blood
plasma. It is also present on the surface of CD4+ and
some CD8+ T-cells. It is thought to be involved in the
regulation of the immune response; occurrence of DP-IV on
a cell surface is associated with the ability of cells to
produce interleukin-2 (IL-2). DP-IV is also referred to
as dipeptidyl-peptide hydrolase DAP-IV or DPP-IV; it is
assigned EC number 3.4.14.5.Three different inhibitors of DP-IV are known.
One of these is a suicide inhibitor: N-Ala-Pro-O-(nitrobenzyl-)
hydroxylamine. (The standard three letter
amino acid codes are used in this application; O
represents oxygen.) Another is a competitive inhibitor:
e-(4-nitro) benzoxycarbonyl-Lys-Pro. The third is a
polyclonal rabbit anti-porcine kidney DP-IV
immunoglobulin.Peptides containing aminoboromic acids are known as inhibitor of DP-IV (See
Flentke et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 : 1556-1559 (1991) ; Kettner
et al. Biochemistry 27 : 7682-7688 (1988)) and of proteinases in general
(See US-A-4,935,493 and Bachovchin et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265: 3738-3743 (1990).The enzymatic activity of DP-IV involves cleaving
of a dipeptide from the free amino terminus of a
polypeptide. DP-IV has a preference for cleaving after a
proline, i.e., a proline in the penultimate position from
the amino terminus. A free amino terminus is required;
thus, DP-IV is a postproline cleaving enzyme with a 
specificity for removing an N-terminal Xaa-Pro dipeptide
from a polypeptide (where Xaa can be any amino acid,
including proline). DP-IV also will remove a Xaa'-Ala
dipeptide from an amino terminus of a polypeptide when
Xaa' is an amino acid with a bulky side group, e.g.,
tyrosine.This invention concerns provision of potent
inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of DP-IV.
Generally, an Î±-amino boronic acid analog of proline
(boroPro is used to designate one such analog which has
the carboxyl group of proline replaced with a B(OH)2
group, where (OH)2 represents two hydroxyl groups and B
represents boron) is bonded to an amino acid to form a
dipeptide with boroPro as the carboxy terminal residue.
