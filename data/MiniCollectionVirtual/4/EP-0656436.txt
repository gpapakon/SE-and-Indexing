<ABSTRACT>
To the end of carrying out the process of 
replacing a cop in an automated weaving machine by 

using a single multi-joint robot, the robot (9) is 
placed near a cop replacing position of a shuttle 2) 

which is reciprocated between warps (3), and a hand 
stand (15) is provided for supporting first through 

third hands (12-14) which can be detachably mounted on 
the robot arm (11). The first hand (12) is provided 

with fingers for individually handling the new cop (17) 
and the new weft (23), the second hand (13) is provided 

with fingers for handling the old cop (7) and the old 
weft 4, and the third hand (14) is provided with a 

suction pad for engaging the shuttle (2) with vacuum 
suction when transferring the shuttle (2), and a hook 

28 for raising and lowering the bobbin (8) fitted on a 
tong 6 of the shuttle (2). The various hands allow 

various work steps to be carried out each in an optimum 
fashion without requiring so many hands to be carried 

by the robot arm at the same time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cop changing device
for a weaving machine, and in particular to an automated cop
changing device for a weaving machine which replaces the cop
adapted to be passed between warps and having a bobbin around
which weft is wound.For instance, in a paper making machine, moisture is
removed from wet fiber pulp by pressing it between a pair of
opposing rollers, and the surface of such rollers consists of
press felt in the form of a relatively broad endless belt. The
press felt is made by entangling the fibers of a pad consisting
of a plurality of layers of web with ground fabric by needling.During the weaving process for ground fabric, the warps
are set on a warp beam and fed continuously while the weft is
supplied by a cop mounted on a shuttle. Therefore, when
weaving a relatively broad ground fabric for making press felt,
the cop needs to be replaced every time the shuttle has
reciprocated a certain number of times through the warps. At
the same time, the weft of the old cop needs to be tied, for
instance by welding, to the weft of the next cop.As an automated device according to the preamble of claim 1 for replacing the cop and tying
the wefts, there is the one disclosed in the United States
Patent No. 5,016,677 (issued May 21, 1991) assigned to the
common assignee. This device comprises a shuttle box, which is
placed on each side of the array of warps for shooting out a
shuttle through the gap between the warps, a unit for pulling
out the shuttle from the shuttle receiving chamber of the
shuttle box when replacing the cop, and a robot arm which pulls
out the old weft from the old cop and the 
new weft from the new cop one after the other to a weft
tying unit, and selectively grips each of the cops
according to control commands to replace the old cop
with the new cop.In this device, the bobbin is detachably mounted
on the shuttle by being fitted on a tong which can be
raised and laid in a selective manner. When replacing
the cop, the shuttle is first of all fixed at a
prescribed location, and the bobbin of the old cop is
raised and is removed from the tong by the cop clamping
hand. Then, a new cop is picked up from a bobbin bin
and fitted on a raised tong with the cop clamping hand.
The new cop is retracted and mounted into the shuttle
so that the weaving process may be resumed.However, according to this device, the hands for
various functions are mounted on a common multi-function
arm, and it was therefore difficult to add any
hands for new functions to the robot arm. A

<CLAIMS>
A cop changing device for a weaving machine in which a
shuttle (2) carrying a cop (7) consisting of a bobbin (8) around

which weft (4) is wound is reciprocated between warps (3) so as
to weave said weft between said warps, comprising a robot (9)

having a robot arm (11) which can be moved within a certain area,
characterised in that it further comprises:


a plurality of hands (12-14) adapted to be interchangeably
mounted on said robot arm for carrying out different work steps

involved in changing a cop, one of said hands having a shuttle
handling finger (29) for moving the shuttle and a hook (28) for

raising and lowering the bobbin inside the shuttle; and
a hand stand (15) for supporting said hands so that each
selected one of said hands may be mounted on said robot arm by

moving and engaging said robot arm to said selected hand.
A cop changing device according to claim 1, wherein at
least one of said hands comprises bobbin clamping fingers (21,

25) for clamping a head portion of said bobbin in a radially
inward direction when replacing said cop, and a bobbin head

holding finger (22, 26) for holding a part of said bobbin
displaced from said head portion at which said bobbin is clamped

by said bobbin clamping fingers to control movement of said head
portion of said bobbin in cooperation with said bobbin clamping

finger when said cop is being transferred from one location to
another.
A cop changing device according to claim 2, wherein said
bobbin head holding finger is provided with a cap member (22, 25)

adapted to be fitted on a free end of said bobbin.
A cop changing device according to claim 1, wherein said
shuttle handling finger (29) comprises a suction pad (29b) that

can be coupled with said shuttle by vacuum suction for moving
said shuttle between a shuttle box (1) and a position for

replacing said cop carried therein. 
A cop changing device according to claim 1, wherein said
hands include an old weft gripping hand (13, 27) for pulling a

weft from said old cop, and a new weft gripping hand (12, 24) for
pulling a weft from said new cop, and a gripping force of said

old weft gripping hand is smaller than that of said new weft
gripping hand.
A cop changing device according to claim 1, wherein said
shuttle is provided with a tong (6) pivotally attached thereto

for fitting said cop thereon, and one of said hands is provided
with a substantially annular member (28) adapted to be fitted on
