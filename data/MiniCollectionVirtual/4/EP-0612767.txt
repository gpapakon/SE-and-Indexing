<ABSTRACT>
Branched aliphatic hydrocarbons, having from 6 to 25 carbon 
atoms and a ratio between the number of methyl groups and the 

number of carbon atoms higher than 0.5, are used in radical 
(co)polymerization processes of fluorinated olefinic monomers, 

optionally in association with non-fluorinated olefins, both 
in suspension and in aqueous emulsion. Such hydrocarbons are 

characterized, in the usual reaction conditions, by a chain 
transfer effect practically absent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radical (co)polymerization 
process of fluorinated olefinic monomers, in which 
a branched aliphatic hydrocarbon is used. As well known in the art, the (co)polymerization reactions 
of fluorinated olefinic monomers are carried out via 
radicals in the presence of suitable initiators, such as inorganic 
peroxides (for instance, ammonium or potassium persulphate) 
or organic peroxides (for instance, disuccinylperoxide 
or other products insoluble in water described in EP-75,312, 
or also azo-compounds (see US 2,515,628 and US 2,520,338). If 
operating at low polymerization temperatures is desired (for 
instance, between 10° and 50°C), redox initiators are employable. Among the various (co)polymerization techniques, that in 
suspension, where the monomers are dispersed in water or in a 
suitable organic solvent, is largely employed. As solvents, 
chlorofluorocarbons, such as trichlorotrifluoroethane, 
dichlorotetrafluoroethane, etc. (see, for example, US-4,513,129 
and EP-271,243), are employed. When operating in 
organic solvent, water can be added to the reaction system, in 
order to promote the loss of heat during the reaction.  
 Viceversa, also when operating in water, an organic solvent 
can be present too, utilized in this case as carrier for 
peroxides, when the solubility or explosivity characteristics 
of the latter prevent their introduction into the reactor in 
the pure state. Another (co)polymerization technique of fluorinated 
olefinic monomers is that in aqueous emulsion, in which it is 
operated in the presence of a suitable surfactant. For 
instance, in US patent 4,426,501, it is described a 
copolymerization process in aqueous emulsion of ethylene, 
propylene or isobutylene with tetrafluoroethylene or chlorotrifluoroethylene, 
in which to the aqueous medium a couple of 
solvents is added, one being hydrophilic, the other hydrophobic, 
able to modify the solubility characteristics in water 
of the different comonomers. In particular, according to such 
a technique, the copolymerization of tetrafluoroethylene 
/ethylene is carried out in aqueous emulsion in the presence 
of terbutylic alcohol as hydrophilic solvent and of 
1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,1-trifluoroethane(CFC 113) as hydrophobic 
solvent. A remarkable improvement in the emulsion (co)polymerization 
technique of fluorinated monomers has been obtained 
with the employment of emulsions or microemulsions of 
perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes, according to what described in US 
Patents 4,789,717 and 4,864,006.
