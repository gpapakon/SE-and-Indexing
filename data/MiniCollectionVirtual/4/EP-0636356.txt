<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hair conditioning
compositions and more specifically it relates to hair
conditioning compositions comprising an alkanolamine
derivative conditioning compound
and a silicone oil
conditioning compound.Quaternary ammonium compounds have been extensively
used as conditioning agents in both rinse-out and leave-on
hair conditioners. In addition, long chain alkyl amines
and alkanolamines have routinely been incorporated into
hair conditioner compositions for use as emulsifiers,
suspending or thickening agents. The quarternary compounds
mentioned above are well known to provide a conditioning
effect on hair by improving detangling, wet combing, dry
combing, wet and dry feel and static/fly away. However,
quaternary ammonium salts alone are unable to provide
sufficient conditioning effects to hair conditioning and
especially to hair that is chemically treated, long, or
naturally wavy.For that reason, silicone oil conditioning compounds
have been utilized to enhance the performance of hair
conditioning compositions. However, silicones are not
compatible with all quaternary salts or all conditioner
bases. For example, most low molecular weight (low vapor
pressure) and high molecular weight (high vapor pressure)
silicone compounds, when combined in a conditioner with a
di- or tri-long-chain alkyl quaternary ammonium salt, do
not yield good conditioning effects on hair. Such
conditioners tend to result in an oily feel and poor
overall combing properties. See, for example, U.S. Patent
No. 4,777,037. Quaternary ammonium salts have routinely been
incorporated into fabric softening compositions. For
example, alkanolamine ester quaternary ammonium salts of
the general formula I

where
R is methyl;A and B are ethylene;and R1 and R2 are alkyl or alkenyl groups having
14 to 18 carbon atoms;
have been incorporated into various laundry fabric
softening compositions. In particular, U.S. Patent No.
3,915,867 discloses the use of N-methyl,N,N-di-(β-C14-C18-acyloxyethyl),N-β-hydroxy
ethyl ammonium methylsulfate as
the active softening ingredient in a fabric softening
composition.The currently utilized quaternary ammonium salts are
frequently made from synthetic sources, are normally not
biodegradable, and have a high toxicity towards fish and
water plants.Similar quaternary ammonium compounds have also been
incorporated into fabric softeners. See, for example,
European Patent application No. EP 295 386 A2; European
Patent Application No. EP 370 675 A2; J.A.C.S., 104: 456-61
(1982); and Comun. Jorn. Com.
