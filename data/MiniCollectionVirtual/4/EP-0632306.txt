<ABSTRACT>
The elastic hinge for spectacles comprises two parts (1) and (2) articulated to one another. One (2) of the parts comprises an extension (11) mounted so that it can slide in a housing (15) provided on the arm (7). A return spring (14) bears, on the one hand, on the end of the extension (11) and, on the other hand, on a locking part (18) solidly attached to the housing (15). The locking part (18) comprises a central part (19) solidly attached to lateral portions (20, 21) each having a transverse projection (22, 23). A first projection (22) penetrates into a hollow (28) in the housing (15) and the second projection (23) serves as a bearing surface for the cam (33) of the hinge-piece (3). The locking part (18) is held in place by a spacer (29) provided on the extension (11). This design allows very quick and easy mounting of the hinge, while reducing the number of its components.
