<ABSTRACT>
A plastic strip (50) on the flexible bow (34) forms a sliding guide for the bars (29) of the flat in their working position. The plastic element is fastened to the bow (34) outside the working range of the bars of the flat. The guide of the bars of the flat at the entry point is designed in such a way that no load peaks are generated in the plastic element.

<CLAIMS>
A revolving flat card with two flexible bends
(104; 112; 170; 192; 200) for guiding the ends of

the flat rods (29) in their working positions,
with each flexible bend being provided with a

plastic element for the purpose of forming a
sliding surface for the flat rods, characterized

in that each plastic element comprises sections
(100; 110; 176; 190; 202; 204) which jointly form

the sliding guide for the flat rods (182).
A card as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the sections (100; 110; 176; 190; 202; 204)

are fastened individually to the flexible bends.
A card as claimed in claim 2, characterized in
that each section (190) is connected in a

positive-locking manner with one of the flexible
bends (192).
A card as claimed in claim 3, characterized in
that each section (190) 
is connected over its
entire length with a flexible bend (192).
A card as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that sections are formed on or fastened to a

common carrier, with the carrier being fastened to
one of the flexible bends.
A card as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the arrangement is made such

that a flat rod simultaneously touches a plurality
of the sections while sliding along the guide.
A card as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that a run-in element (186) is 

provided at the run-in location in order to
determine the angular position of a flat rod

during the first contact with the sections.
A card as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that each section (190) is

arranged as a longitudinal rod (190) which is
arranged transversally to the longitudinal

direction (RB) of the flexible bend (192).
A card as claimed in claim 8, characterized in
that each rod (190) extends from one side to the

other side of the flexible bend (192).
A card as claimed in one of the claims 8 and 9,
characterized in that the angle (W) between the

longitudinal direction (RB) of the flexible bend
(192) and the longitudinal direction (RS) of each

rod (190) is between 30° and 60°.
A card as claimed in one of the claims 8 to 10,
characterized in that each rod (190) is trapezoid

in the cross section.
A card as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the sections (202) are

formed as plates which are provided with distances
(a) from one another.
A card as claimed in one of the claims 8 to 12,
characterized in that the sections (100; 110; 176;

190; 202; 204) are arranged in such a way that the
dirt reaching the sliding surfaces of the sections

is peeled off by the flat rods (29).
A card as claimed in claim 13, characterized in
that peeled-off dirt falls onto the flexible bend.
