<ABSTRACT>
In a method for processing ECG-signals for the purpose of 
detecting low-amplitude signal structures in noise, the ECG-signals 

from a plurality of cardiac cycles are A/D-converted, 
and QRS complexes are detected. The signals from 

at least two cardiac cycles are time-synchronized, whereupon 
the concordance between these signals in intervals 

comprising at least two samples is determined, and an output 
quantity, representing the concordance thus determined, is 

generated, the magnitude of the output quantity designating 
the amplitude of the signal structure in question. A device 

for processing ECG-signals, in a similar manner, comprises 
means (24) for recording ECG-signals from a plurality of 

cardiac cycles, A/D-conversion of the signals and detection 
of QRS complexes. A synchronization unit is arranged to 

time-synchronize the signals from at least two cardiac 
cycles, and a calculator unit (10) is arranged to determine 

the concordance between the signals in time intervals, 
comprising at least two samples. The output means (12) are, 

finally, connected to the calculator unit in order to 
generate an output quantity the magnitude of which 

designates the amplitude of the signal structures in 
question.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for
processing ECG-signals for the purpose of detecting low-amplitude
signal structures in noise of the kind described
in the preambles of claims 1 and 13 respectively.These signal structures, such as so-called late potentials,
have an amplitude of the order of a few ÂµV, usually making
impossible direct, quantitative detection of the same in the
ECG-signal. Signal averaging has hitherto been frequently
used to reduce the level of noise. The signal is further
subjected to highpass filtration in order to eliminate low-frequency
components. The vector quantities of the X, Y and
Z leads is then compared to a threshold value so as to
determine whether or not late potentials are present, cf.
US,A,4 422 459. However, residual noise affects the vector
quantity, thereby degrading accuracy. Important information
in individual leads is also lost when they are combined into
a single vector quantity.Spectral analysis of late potentials has also appeared to be
associated with major difficulties, since spectral analysis
of predominantly transient signals is generally complicated.The object of the present invention is to propose a new
method and provide a new device, based on a statistical
model which explicitly takes the presence of noise into
account, for more reliable detection of low-amplitude signal
structures in ECG-signals.This object is achieved with a method and a device of the
kind mentioned in the introductory part having the
characterizing features set forth in claims 1 and 13 
respectively.The present invention utilizes the circumstance that noise
is essentially uncorrelated from one cardiac cycle to
another, whereas the ECG-activity of interest is repetitive.According to one advantageous further development of the
invention, at least two sub-average values are formed of at
least the part of the signals containing the signal
structure in question from at least two different groups of
cardiac cycles in the plurality of cardiac cycles, whereupon
the concordance between the sub-average values is
determined. This improves the possibility of separating the
signal from noise.In the present invention each lead is processed
individually, thereby avoiding the loss of information which
occurs when a plurality of leads is combined into a single
vector unit.The invention will now be described in greater detail with
the aid of an exemplifying embodiment of the device
according to the invention with reference to the attached
drawings in which
FIG. 1 is an overview
