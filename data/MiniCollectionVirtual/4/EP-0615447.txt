<CLAIMS>
Controlled-release medicament for the treatment 
of painful and/or inflammatory, and also febrile 

disorders, containing flurbiprofen in addition to customary 
pharmaceutical excipients and auxiliaries, characterized 

in that the flurbiprofen is present in the form 
of a pharmaceutically administrable nanosol which, as 

excipient, essentially contains gelatin, fractionated 
gelatin or a gelatin derivative, the nanosol and the 

excipient having an approximate or complete isoionic 
charge equalization. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a racemate. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a pseudoracemate or 

as a mixture of the racemate with its enantiomers. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a pure S- or R-enantiomer. 
Medicament according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a mixture of 

different proportions of S- and R-enantiomers. 
Medicament according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the flurbiprofen is present as a pseudoracemate, 

i.e. in the form of a mixture of the previously separated 
enantiomers. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the nanosol 


a) possesses an inner phase of the flurbiprofen, which 
has a particle size of 10-800 nm and a surface  

 
charge, 
b) has an outer phase of gelatin, fractionated gelatin 
or a gelatin derivative, which is oppositely 

charged, and 
c) an approximate or complete isoionic charge state of 
the inner and outer phases and 
d) is physiologically absorbable. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the flurbiprofen is present as a 

solid, resuspendable nanodispersion. 
Medicament according to Claim 7 and/or 8, characterized 
in that the flurbiprofen has an average particle 

size of below 400 nm. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1-9, 
characterized in that the gelatin has a maximum of the 

molecular weight distribution in the range from 10⁴ to 
10⁷D. 
Medicament according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the gelatin has a maximum of the molecular weight 

distribution of above 9.5 × 10⁴D and a peptide content of 
less than 5% by weight. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1-11, 
characterized in that the gelatin has a percentage weight 

content of the microgel fraction (
>
 10⁷ D) of greater 
than 15%. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized by an outer phase of the nanosol which 

additionally contains viscosity-enhancing substances in 
a weight ratio of gelatin to synthetic or natural polymer 

such as 10:1 to 1000:1. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1-13, 
characterized in that the controlled-release form is a 

tablet. 
Medicament according to Claim 14, characterized 
in that the controlled-release form is a matrix tablet. 
Medicament for the treatment of painful and/or 
inflammatory, and also febrile disorders, containing 

flurbiprofen in addition to customary pharmaceutical 
excipients and auxiliaries, characterized in that it is  

 
partially present as an immediate-effect form and 

partially as a controlled-release form containing 
flurbiprofen in the form of a pharmaceutically 

administrable nanosol. 
Medicament according to Claim 16, characterized 
in that the immediate-effect and controlled-release forms 

are present in a hard gelatin capsule. 
Medicament according to one of Claims 1-16, 
characterized in that the flurbiprofen is present to more 

than 50% as S- or R-flurbiprofen. 
Use of a pharmaceutically administrable nanosol 
of flurbiprofen for the production of medicaments having 

analgesic and/or antirheumatic controlled-release action. 
Use of a pharmaceutically administrable nanosol 
of flurbiprofen for the production of medicaments having 

analgesic and/or antirheumatic, and also anti pyretic 
immediate-effect and controlled-release actions. 
Use according to Claim 19 or 20, characterized in 

that the flurbiprofen is present to more than 50% as 
S- or R-flurbiprofen.
