<ABSTRACT>
A strain relief (30) for an electrical supply cord (26) 
of an electrical appliance includes a first member (32) 

pivotally connected (34) to the housing (44) of the 
appliance. The member includes a generally planar surface 

(35). A second member (40) is connected to the housing (44) 
and has a generally planar surface (41) facing and parallel 

to the planar surface (35) of the first member (32). The 
planar surfaces (35,41) are spaced from each other to define 

an electrical supply cord receiving slot (48). An 
electrical supply cord (26) is movable disposed in the slot 

(48) in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 
cord. Movement of the cord in either longitudinal direction 

causes the first member (32) to rotate relative to the 
second member (40) so that as the planar surface (35) of the 

first member (32) moves relative to the planar surface (41) 
of the second member (46) the width of the cord receiving 

slot (48) is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a strain relief for an 
electrical supply cord of an electrical appliance and 
particularly to a strain relief which operates if the cord 
is pulled or pushed relative to the appliance housing. Electrical appliances such as irons, coffeemakers, and 
the like include electrical supply cords which extend into 
an opening formed in the housing of the appliance. During 
normal use of the appliance, the supply cord may be pushed 
or pulled and in the absence of a suitable strain relief, 
the stress placed on the supply cord will be transmitted to 
the electrical connections of the electrical supply cord. 
If the stress exceeds predetermined limits, the electrical 
connections can be disrupted. Various forms of strain relief devices for electrical 
supply cords are known in the prior art. Some of such 
devices provide only unitary relief, that is strain relief 
when the cord is moved relative to the appliance housing in 
a first direction, eg when the cord is pulled. Other 
strain relief devices provide suitable stress relief when 
the cord is either pulled or pushed; however, such devices 
generally tend to be relatively complicated. Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide 
a strain relief for an electrical appliance which relieves 
stress on the electrical supply cord if the cord is either 
pulled or pushed. The present invention provides a strain relief for an 
electrical supply cord of an electric appliance which has a  
 
housing and an opening in the housing to admit the supply 
cord characterised in that the strain relief comprises:
 
   a first member pivotally connected to the housing and 
having a gripping surface defined by a plurality of spaced 
teeth;
 
   a second member connected to the housing and having a 
surface facing the surface of the first member and spaced 
therefrom to define an electrical supply cord receiving 
slot, the surface of the second member including a plurality 
of spaced teeth; and
 
   an electrical supply cord movably disposed in the slot 
in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 
cord, with movement of the cord in either longitudinal 
direction causing the first member to rotate relative to the 
second member to reduce the width of the slot so that the 
teeth of the first and second members grip the surface of 
the insulation of the cord to prevent further movement of 
the cord in the same longitudinal direction. An embodiment of a strain relief according to the 
invention will now be further described with

1 A strain relief (30) for an electrical supply cord 
(26) of an electric appliance which has a housing (12,24,44) 

and an opening (28) in the housing to admit the supply cord 
characterised in that the strain relief comprises: 

   a first member (32) pivotally connected (34) to the 
housing (44) and having a gripping surface (35) defined by a 

plurality of spaced teeth (36); 
   a second member (40) connected to the housing (44) and 

having a surface (41) facing the surface (35) of the first 
member (32) and spaced therefrom to define an electrical 

supply cord receiving slot (48), the surface of the second 
member (40) including a plurality of spaced teeth (42); and 

   an electrical supply cord (26) movably disposed in the 
slot (48) in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis 

of the cord, with movement of the cord in either 
longitudinal direction causing the first member (32) to 

rotate relative to the second member (40) to reduce the 
width of the slot (48) so that the teeth (36,42) of the 

first and second members (32,40) grip the surface of the 
insulation of the cord (26) to prevent further movement of 

the cord in the same longitudinal direction. 
2 A strain relief according to Claim 1 characterised in 
that the second member (40) comprises a rib formed 

integrally with the housing (44). 
3 A strain relief according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 
characterised in that the housing (44) includes a boss (33) 

extending from a surface thereof and the first member is 
pivotally mounted thereon. 
4 A strain relief (30) for an electrical supply cord (26) 
of an electrical appliance which has a housing (12,24,44) 

and an opening (28) in the housing to admit the supply cord 
characterised in that the strain relief comprises: 

   a first member (32) pivotally connected to the housing 
(44) and including a generally planar surface (35); 

   a second member (40) connected to the housing (44) and 
having a generally p
lanar surface (41) facing and parallel 
to the planar surface (35) of the first member (32) and 

spaced therefrom to define an electrical supply cord 
receiving slot (48); and 

   an electrical supply cord (26) movably disposed in the 
slot (48) in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis 

of the cord, with movement of the cord in either 
longitudinal direction causing the first member (32) to 

rotate relative to the second member (40) so that as the 
planar surface (35) of the first member (32) moves relative 

to the planar surface (41) of the second member (40) the 
width of the cord receiving slot (48) is reduced. 
5 A strain relief according to Claim 4 characterised in 
that the planar surface (35) of the first member (32) 

includes a plurality of spaced teeth (36). 
6 A strain relief according to Claim 4 or Claim 5 
characterised in that the planar surface (41) of the second 

member (40) includes a plurality of spaced teeth (42). 
7 A strain relief according to any of Claims 4, 5 or 6 
characterised in that the second member (40) comprises a rib 

formed integrally with the housing (44). 
8 A strain relief according to any of Claims 4, 5, 6 or 7 
characterised in that the housing (44) includes a boss (33) 

 
extending from a surface thereof and the first member (32) 

is pivotally mounted (34) thereon.

an opening (28) in the housing to admit the supply cord, 
characterised in that the strain relief comprises: 

   a first member (32) pivotally connected (34) to the

   a second member (40) connected to the housing (44) and 
having a cord gripping surface (41) facing the cord gripping 

surface (35) of the first member (32) and spaced therefrom 
to define an electrical supply cord receiving slot (48); and 

   an electrical supply cord (26) movably disposed in the 
slot (48) in response to pushing or pulling of the cord by 

the use of the appliance, with movement of the cord in 
response to pulling or pulling forces causing the first 

member (32) to rotate relative to the second member (40) so 
that the width of the slot (48) is reduced to prevent 

further movement of the cord (26) in response to the push or 
pull force applied by the user. 
10 A strain relief (30) for an electrical supply cord 
according to Claim 9 characterised in that the first member 

(32) comprises a planar surface (35) defined by two end 
surfaces wherein the geometrical shape of the planar surface

end of the planar surface rotated towards the center of the 
slot reduces the width of the slot.
