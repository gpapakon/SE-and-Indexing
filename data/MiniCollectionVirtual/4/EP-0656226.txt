<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved vanadium/phosphorus 
oxide oxidation catalyst. Maleic anhydride is staple article of commerce used in 
the production of polyesters. It is prepared, inter alia, 
through the catalytic oxidation of butane, available for 
example from petroleum refinery streams. See, e.g., U.S. 
Patent No. 3,864,280. The catalyst of choice for this oxidation 
is one comprising vanadium, phosphorus, and oxygen, 
generally known as a vanadium/phosphorus oxide oxidation 
catalyst or phosphorus-vanadium mixed oxide catalyst. It has been proposed that vanadyl (IV) pyrophosphate, 
(VO)₂P₂O₇, is the active phase in the selective oxidation of 
n-butane to maleic anhydride. The pyrolytic precursor to 
vanadyl (IV) pyrophosphate is believed to be vanadyl (IV) 
hydrogen phosphate hemihydrate, or VOHPO₄.(H₂O)0.5. This 
material has long been recognized as a layered material, the 
-POH groups forming interlayer hydrogen bonds and the water 
molecule being shared by two vanadyl octahedra which are 
face-linked. A variety of such catalysts and methods for their production 
have been described. U.S. Patent No. 3,864,280 describes a crystalline phosphorus-vanadium 
mixed oxide hydrocarbon oxidation catalyst 
in which the vanadium has an average valence of from +3.9 to 
+4.6, the P:V ratio is from 0.9:1 to 1.8:1, and the B-phase 
content is at least 25%.  U.S. Patent No. 4,043,943 describes forming a phosphorus-vanadium-oxygen 
precursor by calcining an intermediate 
obtained by reacting a vanadium compound with phosphorus 
compound in an oxygen-containing solvent containing less 
than 20% water. U.S. Patent No. 4,100,106 describes a process in which 
a water precipitated salt complex formed from tetravalent 
vanadium salt and orthophosphoric acid is calcined at a temperature 
of at least 300°C. U.S. Patent No. 4,116,868 describes a catalyst prepared 
by calcining a phosphorus-vanadium-oxygen precursor formed 
in the presence of a small amount of surfactant. U.S. Patent No. 4,132,670 describes a crystalline phosphorus-vanadium 
mixed oxide hydrocarbon oxidation catalyst 
in which the vanadium has an average valence of from +4.0 to 
+4.5, the V:P ratio is about 1:1, and the intrinsic surface 
area is from 1 m²/g to 10 m²/g. U.S. Patent No. 4,288,372 describes a catalyst similar 
to that set forth in U.S. Patent No. 3,864,280 but having a 
surface area greater than 10 m²/g and containing lanthanum 
as a promoter. U.S. Patent No. 4,337,174 describes forming a phosphorus-vanadium-oxygen 
precursor
