<ABSTRACT>
A circularly polarized microcell antenna (10) that requires only a 
single feed-line to 

radiate circularly polarized electromagnetic energy therefrom. The 
antenna (10) comprises 

a reflector box (14) having a bottom (15) and side walls (17) to which an 
electrical connector 

(20) is mounted. The center conductor (24) of the connector (20) is 
electrically connected to a 

conductor bar (22) upon which a first dipole assembly is mounted at 
a designated one-quarter 

wavelength location. The shell of the connector (20) is electrically 
connected to the 

reflector box (14) upon which a second dipole assembly is mounted at 
a designated one-quarter 

wavelength location. Each dipole assembly comprises a primary dipole 
arm (52) 

and a secondary dipole arm (68) which are electrically connected by a 
phasing loop that 

introduces a 90째 phase shift between the primary dipole arm (52) and the 
secondary dipole 

arm (68). Thus, a single feed-line is capable of feeding both the primary 
and secondary 

dipoles so as to allow circularly polarized electromagnetic energy to 
radiate therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to circularly polarized antennae and, more particularly, to a
circularly polarized microcell antenna that requires only a single feed-line to radiate circularly
polarized electromagnetic signals from a pair of crossed dipoles.The use of cellular telephone communication systems has increased dramatically in recent
years. In conjunction with this increased use, the number of cellular telephone transmission
sites has also increased. Associated with each cellular telephone transmission site are a
number of antennae for transmitting signals in the cellular telephone frequency band of the
electromagnetic spectrum. It is common in the cellular telephone communications industry for
these antennae to transmit these signals in a circularly polarized manner.Circular polarization of electromagnetic signals transmitted from cellular telephone antennae
may be achieved with a pair of crossed, one-half wavelength, dipoles that are fed with equal
currents from a synchronous source so as to result in quadrature phasing. The standard
method of feeding these dipole pairs is to run a separate feed-line to each dipole pair, with the
two feed-lines having a 90째 phase length difference between them. However, running a
separate feed-line to each dipole pair can be both cumbersome and costly with regard to
equipment expenditures and maintenance. It also reduces the impedance bandwidth of the
antenna. In IEEE PROCEEDINGS PART H, vol. 139, no. 2, April 1992, pages 157 and 158 an antenna
for circular polarisation is described which has two dipole pairs and which utilizes a short
circuited stub transmission line that runs along one dipole pair to introduce a reactive or
j-component in parallel with the y-component of the electric field. This reactive component
introduces the 90 degree phase shift necessary for circular polarization.GB-A-2 034 125 shows a coaxial phased array antenna which has a pair of crossed-dipole
elements positioned within an inner cavity and four monopole elements symmetrically arranged
in an outer cavity. The pair of crossed-dipole elements is centered within the inner cavity and
operated by the elements of the outer cavity which realizes a phase shifting network. Two
dipoles of the crossed-dipole elements are fed respectively by a coaxial line. The external
phase shifting network provides the 90 degree phasing to generate circularly polarized
radiation.It would be desirable to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings of using separate feed-lines
for each dipole pair in the
