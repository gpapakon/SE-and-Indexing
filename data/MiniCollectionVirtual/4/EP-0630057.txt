<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more 
precisely to a semiconductor device in which some segments of the 
wiring are replaced with optical waveguides to achieve signal 
transmission using optical means. In recent years, large scale integrated circuits (LSI) have 
become more and more integrated, and the wiring (metallization) 
which electrically connects circuit elements has become more 
dense. With the progress of higher integration, it becomes more 
and more difficult to place the wiring on a two-dimensional plane 
without crossing each other, so the wiring has been one of the 
obstacles of higher integration. Therefore, multi-layer wiring, 
which comprises three-dimensional wiring, has been introduced. However, the following problems remain with multi-layer 
wiring: 1) the problem of the contact resistance between the 
upper and lower wiring, 2) the problem of the wiring materials, 
3) the problems of the insulation materials which insulate  
 
between the upper and lower wiring, and 4) the problem of shape 
control such as planarization. All of these are difficult 
problems. As a result, a technique has been proposed (Jpn. J. Appl. 
Phys. Vol. 32 (1993), p270) which replaces some segments of the 
LSI wiring with optical waveguides in the optical plate provided 
outside and optically transmits signals. According to this 
method, as shown in Figure 6, an optical plate 20 made of quartz 
glass in which an optical waveguide(s) is formed is sandwiched 
between two integrated circuit substrates 10a and 10b comprising 
an integrated circuit 12 formed on a semiconductor single crystal 
substrate 11, and optical signals are transmitted through said 
optical plate 20 between a laserdiode (LD) 13 and a photodiode 
(PD) 14 provided in the integrated circuit substrates 10. The method described above is an epoch making method which 
replaces part of the wiring conventionally done only using 
aluminum and such metal wiring with optical signal transmission, 
and introduction of this method into practical use is receiving 
attention. However, the problems accompanying higher integration of 
LSI's, as described above, include not only the difficulties in 
the wiring process but also problems due to the structure of the 
integrated circuit substrate. That is, the conventional 
configuration of an integrated circuit substrate, in which the  
 
integrated circuit is formed on a semiconductor single crystal 
substrate made of bulk crystal, has devices formed on bulk 
crystal, and because of this,
