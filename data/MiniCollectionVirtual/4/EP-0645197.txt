<ABSTRACT>
Device to discard short bars (11a) which is associated 
with feeder means (12) that comprise a plurality of first 

conveyor chains (14a) and a matching plurality of second 
conveyor chains (14b), on which the bars (11) are positioned 

perpendicular to the conveyor chains (14) and are fed in a 
direction at a right angle to the lengthwise extent of the 

bars (11), the downstream ends of the first conveyor chains 
(14a) and upstream ends of the second conveyor chains (14b) 

being progressively staggered so as to define a separation 
channel (13) positioned at an angle to the axis of feed of 

the bars (11), an angle of between 10째 and 45째 being defined 
between the separation channel (13) and the axis of the bars 

(11), the separation channel (13) cooperating with bridge 
means (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device to discard short bars, as
set forth in the main claim.The device to discard short bars according to the
invention comprises conveyor chain means which feed
bars, so as to
discard bars of a length shorter than a pre-set length.The state of the art covers the problem of having to
discard, from a plurality of bars being fed side by side in
a direction at a right angle to the lengthwise extent of the
bars on a plurality of conveyor chain means, the bars which
are too short to meet the requirements of a pre-determined
length.In fact, the bars which are not of the right length have
to be discarded so as to be able to ensure the formation of
bundles of bars consisting only of bars having a given
minimum length according to the requirements laid down.The bars which are too short are discarded at the present
time by making the plurality of bars travel side by side on
a plurality of substantially horizontal conveyor chains
which include at a certain point a separation channel having
its axis parallel to the axis of the bars being fed and
therefore substantially perpendicular to the direction of
feed of the bars.Bridge-type supporting means are included at the
separation channel, are fitted suitably spaced apart
crosswise and extend by a length enough to straddle the
separation channel fully.The transverse distance between the supporting means is
such that the bars longer than the required minimum length
rest at their ends on the supporting means, with which are
associated chains that carry out the feed of the bars. The bars which do not reach the pre-set minimum length
fall when they arrive at the separation channel, since they
are no longer upheld by the conveyor chains or by the
lateral supporting means.But this system entails the problem that the bars which
have a suitable length but too small a cross-section and
which are supported only at their ends by the supporting
means bend at their centre and create problems at the time
when they should cooperate with the feeder means positioned
downstream of the separation channel.GB-A-1,173,641 shows a device suitable to select bars
according to their length, wherein bars which do not satisfy
a required minimum length are discarded.The device comprises means to feed the bars consisting of
a plurality of first conveyor chains and a matching
plurality of second conveyor chains, on which the bars are
laid in a direction at a right angle to their direction of
feed.Between the beginning of the second conveyor chains and
the end of the first

<CLAIMS>
Device to discard short bars,
having feeder means (12)

comprising a plurality of first conveyor chains (14a) and a
matching plurality of second conveyor chains (14b), between

the downstream ends of the first conveyor chains (14a) and the
upstream ends of the second conveyor chains (14b) there being a

separation channel (13) crossed by bridge means (15),
the bars being positionable adjacent and substantially parallel

to one another on said feeder means (12) in a direction at right
angles to the longitudinal axis of feed of the feeder means

(12),
the device being

characterised in that said downstream ends of the first conveyor chains
(14a) and said upstream ends of the second conveyor chains (14b)

are progressively staggered so as to define said separation
channel (13) which channel is positioned at an angle with respect

to the orthogonal from the longitudinal axis of feed of the feeder
means (12), the angle being of between 10째 and 45째. 
Device as in Claim 1, in which the bridge means (15) can
be moved transversely to define the length of the bars (11).
Device as in Claim 1 or 2, in which supporting arms (17)
cooperate with the separation channel (13) and have a first

working position (17a), in which they support the too short
bars (11a), and a second discharge position (17b) for the

discharge of the too short bars (11a) onto a removal roller
conveyor (18).
Device as in Claim 1 or 2, in which an auxiliary
conveyor belt (19) for discharge of too short bars (11a)

onto a removal roller conveyor (18) cooperates with the
separation channel (13).
