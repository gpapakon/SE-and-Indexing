<ABSTRACT>
A parallel link mechanism is 
formed by a lower arm (2) supported on a 

lower base (1) so that the lower arm (2) can 
be tilted longitudinally, a connecting link 

(21) extending in parallel with the lower 
arm (2) and supported on the lower base 

(1) so that the connecting link (21) can 
be tilted longitudinally, and an upper base 

(22) to which the upper end portions of 
the lower arm (2) and connecting link (21) 

are connected pivotably. The upper base 
(22) supports thereon a swing member (3) 

adapted to be swung horizontally, and an 
upper arm (4) provided in a position offset 

from an axis 
Z
 of swinging movement of 
the swing member (3) so that the upper arm 

(4) can be tilted vertically. Accordingly, 
the upper and lower arms do not interfere 

with each other, and the range of working 
of the upper arm can be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an industrial articulated robot. Hitherto, there are disclosed industrial articulated robots 
comprising a turning bed turning in a horizontal direction on a 
fixed base, a lower arm provided so that it can be inclined in 
forward and backward directions on the turning bed, an upper arm 
provided at the front end portion of the lower arm so that it can 
be inclined in upper and lower directions, a drive link provided 
so that it can be inclined in upper and lower directions on the 
turning bed, and a connecting link in parallel to the lower arm, 
which connects the upper arm and the drive link, whereby parallel 
link mechanism is constituted by the upper arm, the lower arm,  
 
the drive link and the connecting link, the articulated robot 
body further comprising a turning arm rotatable about the axis 
along the length direction of the upper arm, and a wrist portion 
which can be inclined in a direction vertical to the turning axis 
of the turning arm (e.g., Tokkaihei No. 2-31691 (Japanese Patent 
Application Laid Open No. 31691/1990), Tokkaihei No. 3-202288 
(Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 202288/1991, Tokkaihei 
No. 3-245980 (Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 
245980/1991). However, when the turning bed is turned, it is turned in such 
a manner to support all weights of the lower arm, the upper arm, 
the turning arm, and the wrist portion which are integrally 
loaded on the turning bed. As a result, there were the problems 
that the structure of turning device for driving the turning bed 
becomes large and it is difficult to increase turning speed. As means for solving this problem, 
in the closest prior art 
there is disclosed an 
articulated robot in which, as a parallel link mechanism 
including lower arm, a turning section supported at the front end  
 
portion of the lower arm so that it is turned in a horizontal 
direction is provided in place of directly connecting the upper 
arm to the lower arm front end portion so that it is maintained 
to be horizontal even if the lower arm is inclined; and an upper 
arm extending in a lateral direction from the turning section, 
a turning arm rotatable about the axis along the length direction 
of the upper arm, and a wrist portion which can be inclined in 
a direction vertical to the turning axis of the turning arm are 
further provided, whereby the turning section is adapted to 
support only weights of the upper arm, the turning arm and the 
wrist portion, thus to reduce weight as load of the turning 
section

<CLAIMS>
An articulated robot in which a parallel link mechanism is 
constituted by a lower base (1), a lower arm (2) supported at said lower 

base (1) so that it can be inclined in forward and backward directions, 
a connecting link (21) in parallel to said lower arm (2) and 

supported at said lower base (1) so that it can be inclined in 
forward and backward directions, and an upper base (22) connecting the 

front end of said lower arm (2) and the front end of said connecting 
arm (21) so that they can be rotated, said articulated robot including 

a turning section (3) supported at said upper base (22) so that it can be 
turned in a horizontal direction, and a single upper arm (4) provided at 

said turning section (3),
 
   characterized in that said upper arm (4) is supported at the 

position shifted relative to the turning axis (Z) of said turning 
section (3) so as to permit said upper arm (4) to be inclined in upper 

and lower directions.
