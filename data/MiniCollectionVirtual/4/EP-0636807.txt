<ABSTRACT>
Brake pad with a damping shim (3) and a damping shim for a brake pad. To allow the shim to be fastened to the carrier plate (1) of the brake pad, the said shim has at least one projection, which projects from its plane, is surrounded on all sides by the damping shim, engages in a corresponding aperture in the carrier plate (1) and is formed by an arched embossed portion (6, 26) of the damping shim which is bounded by a cut (28, 29) or by two cuts (11, 12, 13, 14) in the damping shim, one edge of which cut or cuts extends outside the plane of the damping shim.

<CLAIMS>
A dampening sheet (3) for a brake pad, which dampening 
sheet includes at least one projection for fastening to a 

backplate (1) of the brake pad, said projection protruding 
from the plane of the dampening sheet, being totally surrounded 

by the dampening sheet (3) and formed by a domed 
embossment (6, 7; 26, 27) of the dampening sheet (3) and 

adapted to engage in a corresponding recess (4, 5) in the 
backplate (1), 
characterized
 in that the domed embossment (26, 
27) is defined by a cut (28, 29) in the dampening sheet (23) 

having one cutting edge extend outside of the plane of the 
dampening sheet (23). 
The dampening sheet (3) as defined in the preamble of 
claim 1, characterized in that the domed embossment (6, 7) is 

defined by two cuts (11, 12, 13, 14) in the dampening sheet 
(3), each having one cutting edge (e.g. 11a) extend outside of 

the plane of the dampening sheet (3). 
The dampening sheet as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the cutting edge(s) of the embossment 

is/are rectilinear. 
The dampening sheet as claimed in claim 2 or claims 3 and 
2, characterized in that the two cutting edges of the embossment 

are parallel to each other. 
The dampening sheet as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that at least two embossments are provided 

which are oriented approximately vertically with respect to 
each other, based on their cutting edges. 
A brake pad comprising a backplate (1) with a friction 
lining (2) at one side of the backplate and a dampening sheet 

(3) according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 5 at the 
other side of the backplate (1).  

 
The brake pad as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that, in the area of the cutting edge(s) of the embossment, 

the recess has the same contour as the cutting edges. 
The brake pad as claimed in claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the recess is rectangular. 
The brake pad as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the embossment is closely fitted in the 

recess. 
The brake pad as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the embossment is fitted with such 

tolerance in the recess as to permit limited clearance of 
motion of the dampening sheet. 
The brake pad as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that the embossment has its cutting edge(s) 

oriented transversely of the direction of the principal shearing 
force between the dampening sheet and the backplate. 
The brake pad as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 11, 
characterized in that the backplate has at least one anchoring 

aperture for the friction lining which aperture is filled with 
friction lining material, and in that the recess provided to 

receive an embossment of the dampening sheet is formed at 

least partly in the friction lining material which is located 
in the anchoring aperture.
