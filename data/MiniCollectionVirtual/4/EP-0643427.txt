<ABSTRACT>
The stator of the motor comprises a frame (15) carrying at least one pair of transducers each including a vibrating element, arranged colinearly and excited in such a way that their vibrating elements vibrate at the same frequency, but with a phase shift of 90 DEG , and a coupling means (3) to which the vibrations are applied, and at least one rotor (10, 11) driven by friction by the coupling means. The coupling means (3) is an elastic part of at least approximately elliptical or semi-elliptical shape or basket-handle shaped, fixed at two points opposite the transducers. The coupling part fills the triple role of the vibration coupler, of vibration geometric converter, and of mechanical amplitude converter.

An electric motor comprising at least one pair of transducers (1, 2; 
1', 2'; 101, 102) each comprising a vibrating element, these transducers 

being located colinearly in order to generate longitudinal vibrations in the 
direction of the axis of alignment, in permanent contact via one of their ends 

with a support structure (70; 15; 24; 38, 39; 46; 51; 60; 66; 104; 107) and
