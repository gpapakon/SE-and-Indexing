<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for preventing overstabilization of longitudinal differential protections in case of internal faults on power lines, which may take place when a fault situation, which is indicated as an external fault, is in reality an internal fault. The invention comprises criteria which finally provide information as to whether the longitudinal differential protection is to enter into operation. The criteria comprise level and directional determination of the currents which are measured in the terminals of the power lines, checking whether these have the same direction, and so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
A differential protection is a type of protection used for 
preventing damage which may arise in connection with internal 
faults on busbars, generators, motors, transformers, 
power lines, etc. The requirements on the protection are somewhat different 
depending on the object to be protected. An unjustified 
protective function must be prevented and this can be done 
by stabilizing the protection. This means that attempts are 
made to make the protection unsusceptible to certain 
internal and external electrical transients and to external 
electrical faults. It is necessary, for example, to prevent 
that inrush current surges, overmagnetization currents, 
continuous currents, saturation of current transformers, 
etc., lead to an unjustified protective function. The present invention relates to a special stabilizing 
problem which may arise when the differential protection is 
to protect against internal faults on power lines. Within 
the technical field in question, such a differential protection 
is referred to as a longitudinal differential protection. Figure 1 is a summary of the principle disclosed in the 
prior art concerning stabilization of a longitudinal 
differential protection. Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 show different fault situations which 
may arise in a T-network.  
 Figure 6 shows a combined flow chart and block diagram 
according to the invention for supplementation of the 
stabilization measures for a longitudinal differential 
protection. Figure 7 shows how the supplementation constitutes part of 
the stabilization measures of the longitudinal differential 
protection. A differential protection is a type of protection which by 
means of current transformers measures and via a differential 
connection compares incoming and outgoing current in 
the protective object. The intention is that, when a 
differential current arises which exceeds a set value, which 
shall normally indicate that a fault has arisen in the 
protective object, then the protection is to become 
activated. As mentioned, however, certain electrical 
transients both in the protective object and outside the 
protective object, as well as external electrical faults, 
may influence the protective function in such a way that the 
protection interprets the transient or the fault as a fault 
in the protective object and activates the protection. To 
prevent this, the protection is stabilized. Differential protections are often designed such that two 
different circuits can be distinguished, namely, a differential 
circuit and a

criterion is fulfilled when at least two of the terminal 
currents, the value of which is continuously sensed by a 

level detector, have a value which exceeds a minimum fault 
current level k·I

currents is determined, the second criterion comprising 

checking if the fault situation is interpreted as an external 
fault because the directions of these terminal currents 

are different, and, if this is the case, determining the
