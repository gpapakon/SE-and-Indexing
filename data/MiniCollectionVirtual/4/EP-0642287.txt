<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication system is described with a 
base station and mobile stations to which paging time slots 

are assigned. The base station includes paging means which, 
prior to transmitting data to a mobile station, transmits a 

paging message identifying this mobile station during a 
paging time slot assigned thereto. The mobile stations each 

include receipt control means allowing it to receive a paging 
message during its assigned paging time slots only. The 

mobile stations are arranged in groups to which sets of 
paging time slots are assigned. The sets of a group are 

ranked in such a way that paging time slots of sets of a 
lower rank also belong to sets of a higher rank, sets of a 

higher rank having more paging time slots than sets of a 
lower rank. The mobile stations include selection means for 

selecting either one of these sets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system
including a base station and a plurality of mobile stations to each of which control
time slots are assigned, said base station including transmission control means
which, when data is to be transmitted to a said mobile station, transmits a control
message identifying said mobile station during at least one of said control time
slots assigned thereto, and each of said mobile stations including receipt control
means allowing said mobile station to receive a said control message during said
assigned control time slots only.Such a mobile communication system is already known in the art,
e.g. from the published international patent application WO-A-92/09148. Therein
the time slots are arranged in frames each of which includes one control time slot
which may be assigned to one or more mobile stations and which is referred to in
the latter patent application as down-setup slot and hereinafter as paging time slot.
When a communication is to be set up from a first mobile station to a second one,
the first mobile station transmits a request-for-access signal to the base station of
the area wherein the first mobile station is located. This base station thereupon
performs a number of administrative tasks constituting a so-called authentication
procedure, then allocates a traffic channel to the first mobile station, and finally
addresses a register to get the identity of the areas wherein the second mobile
station may be located. The base station then informs the base stations of these
areas of the fact that a communication is to be set up with this second mobile
station. As a consequence the latter base stations then each transmit a paging
message within a paging time slot assigned to this second mobile station. When
not involved in a communication each mobile station must therefore at least 
listen for this paging message during the paging time slots
assigned to it.In order to reduce the amount of power consumed by
a mobile station not involved in a communication this mobile
station is brought in idle mode by disabling its receive and
demodulating circuits during time slots which are not paging
time slots assigned to it. Furthermore, power may be even
more reduced by only assigning to the mobile station one
paging time slot every n frames, provided the base station is
aware of this and hence knows within which paging time slots
this mobile station can be addressed by means of a paging
message.However, when in this case a communication is to be
set up

<CLAIMS>
Mobile communication system including a base station and a
plurality of mobile stations to each of which control time slots are assigned, said

base station including transmission control means which, when data is to be
transmitted to a said mobile station, transmits a control message identifying said

mobile station during at least one of said control time slots assigned thereto, and
each of said mobile stations including receipt control m
eans allowing said mobile
station to receive a said control message during said assigned control time slots

only, 
characterized in that
 said mobile stations are arranged in groups to each of
which sets of control time slots are assigned, the sets of a group being ranked in

such a way that control time slots of sets of a lower rank also belong to sets of a
higher rank, sets of a higher rank having more control time slots than sets of a

lower rank, and that said mobile stations include selection means for selecting one
of said sets.
Mobile communication system according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 said control time slots constitute paging time slots and that said control
message constitutes a paging message.
Mobile communication system according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 said control time slots are predetermined time slots of a time division
multiplexed structure consisting of time slots arranged in frames, and that for each

set the number of control time slots in a frame is an integer divider of the total
number of control time slots in a frame.
Mobile communication system according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the number of control time slots of a set of a higher rank is an integer
multiple of the number of control time slots of a set of a lower rank. 
Mobile communication system according to claim
1, 
characterized in that
 said control time slots are
predetermined time slots of a time division multiplexed

structure consisting of time slots arranged in frames, and
that said base station includes a base station control means

only allowing it to transmit said control message during
predetermined ones of said control time slots per frame.
Mobile communication system according to claim
4, 
characterized in that
 the total number of control time
slots per frame is an integer multiple of the number of

control time slots within which said base station is allowed
to transmit said control message.
Mobile communication system according to claim
1, 
characterized in that
 said control time slots are
predetermined time slots of a time division multiplexed

structure consisting of time slots arranged in frames, and
that the number of control time slots of a set is limited to

one per n frames, n being an integer.
Mobile communication system according to claim
1, 
characterized in that
 mobile stations of an administrative
class of mobile stations belong to a same said group.
Paging method for a mobile communication system
including a base station and a plurality of mobile stations

to each of which paging time slots are assigned, and
including the steps of :


when data is to be transmitted from said base station to
said mobile stations, transmitting a paging message including

information identifying said mobile stations within at least
one of said paging time slots assigned to said mobile

stations; and
only allowing said mobile stations to receive a said paging
message during said assigned paging time slots;
characterized in that
 it further includes the steps of :

grouping said mobile stations in groups; and
ranking the mobile stations of a same group in such a way
that paging time slots assigned to mobile stations of a lower

rank are also assigned to mobile stations of a higher rank,
more paging time slots being assigned to mobile stations of

a higher rank than to mobile stations of a lower rank.
