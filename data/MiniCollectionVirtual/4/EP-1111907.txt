<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for enhancing a digital image channel, e.g., a
channel comprising a texture signal, by providing a predetermined estimate of the

noise expected for the digital channel based on a predetermined relationship
between the image intensity values and the expected noise for given intensities.

After a local estimate of signal activity is generated for the digital image channel, a
gain adjustment is generated from the predetermined estimate of noise and the

local estimate of signal activity; the gain adjustment is applied to the image pixels
in the digital channel in order to generate a digital channel with enhanced image

values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of digital image
processing and, more particularly, to a method for enhancing the texture of a
digital image.Traditional methods of increasing the apparent sharpness of a
digital image, such as the technique of unsharp masking, often produce unwanted
artifacts at large transition edges in the image. For example, unsharp masking is
often described by the equation:
Sproc = Sorg+B(Sorg-Sus)
where Sproc represents the processed image signal in which the high frequency
components have been amplified, Sorg represents the original image signal, Sus
represents the unsharp image signal, typically a smoothed image signal obtained
by filtering the original image, and B represents the high frequency emphasis
coefficient.The unsharp masking operation may be modeled as a linear system.
Thus, the magnitude of any frequency in Sproc is directly dependent upon the
magnitude of that frequency in the Sorg image signal. As a consequence of this
superposition principle, large edges in the Sorg image signal will often display a
ringing artifact in the Sproc signal when the desired level of high frequency
enhancement has been performed in other areas of the Sproc signal. This ringing
artifact appears as a light or dark outline around the large edge, and may be
visually objectionable.Many non-linear filters based on local statistics exist for the
purposes of noise reduction, sharpening, and contrast adjustment. For example, the
median filter is well known in the art. In this filter, typically implemented for noise
reduction, each pixel is replaced with the median value of some surrounding
neighborhood. This filtering process is generally very successful at removing 
impulse noise; however, the processed image appears slightly less sharp than the
original.Another example of a non-linear filter based on local statistics is
local histogram equalization, referred to as adaptive histogram modification by
William Pratt on pages 278 - 284 of the book Digital Image Processing, Second
Edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1991. With this filter, the values of pixels are
modified by the cumulative histogram of a local window. This technique
effectively adjusts the contrast of each region of a digital image, effectively
increasing the local contrast in some regions of the image, and decreasing the
contrast in other regions. This technique does not intend to increase the apparent
sharpness of any given region. Also, this technique does not ensure that the typical
artifacts of ringing will not occur.There

<CLAIMS>
A method for enhancing a digital image channel comprised of a
plurality of image pixels, said method comprising the steps of:


(a) splitting (50) the digital image channel into first and second
channels that substantially comprise the digital image channel, said first and

second channels each composed of image intensity values corresponding to the
image 
pixels, wherein the first channel contains the texture information of the
digital image channel and the second channel is a pedestal signal additionally

containing edge information of the digital image channel;
(b) generating (190) an intensity dependent estimate of noise
using the image intensity values of the second channel and a predetermined

relationship between expected noise and image intensity values;
(c) generating (170) a local estimate of signal activity for the
digital image channel;
(d) generating (180, 134) a gain adjustment from the estimate of
noise provided in step (b) and the local estimate of signal activity generated in step

(c);
(e) applying (136) the gain adjustment to the image pixels in the
first channel in order to generate a first channel with enhanced image values; and
(f) combining (80) the first channel with enhanced image
values and the second channel to generate an enhanced digital image channel.
The method of claim 1 wherein said predetermined relationship
is provided in the form of a noise table and step (b) performs a table lookup to find

said estimate of noise.
The method of claim 1 wherein the local estimate of signal
activity estimated in step (c) is a local variance calculated over the region.
The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein step (d) further
comprises; 


generating (180) a local signal to noise ratio (SNR) value from the
estimate of noise generated in step (b) and the local estimate of signal activity

generated in step (c); and
generating (134) a gain adjustment for each image pixel from the
local SNR value.
The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the local estimate of
signal activity for the digital image channel generated in step (c) is a mean absolute

deviation of the digital image channel.
