<ABSTRACT>
A system (10) for dispensing materials made of 
two components includes a side-by-side pair of 

collapsible tubes (36, 36a, 38, 38a) that fit within a 
barrel (22) of a pressurized air applicator (12). As 

air is admitted into the barrel (22), the tubes (36, 
36a, 38, 38a) simultaneously collapse to direct 

components in the tubes (36, 36a, 38, 38a) through 
outlet ports and into a static mixer (16) where the 

components are mixed to a homogeneous mass. Each tube 
(36, 36a, 38, 38a) includes a relatively rigid front 

and rear end piece (42, 42a, 44, 43a), and the end 
pieces (42, 42a, 44, 43a) are coupled together by pin 

elements (54, 54a) for ease of handling and to 
facilitate dispensing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dispensing assembly
that includes a side-by-side pair of tubes for storing
initially separate components. During a dispensing
operation, the tubes are collapsed to direct the
components through a static mixer where the components
are mixed for application directly to a work site.A variety of materials are made of two or more
initially separate components that are preferably not
mixed until immediately prior to use. Examples of
such materials include epoxy adhesives, sealants and
coatings used in the construction industry, and dental
materials such as dental restoratives, adhesives and
impressioning materials. In many instances, such two-component
materials may unduly cure, harden or become
otherwise unsatisfactory for use if mixed too far in
advance of the actual time that the material is
applied to the work site.U.S. -A- 4,538,920,
describes a
dispensing device for mixing and dispensing material
made of two initially separate components. This known device
includes a
syringe having side-by-side parallel internal chambers
and a pair of plungers to force the contents of the
chambers through respective outlet passages and
subsequently through a static mixing element carried 
within an exit conduit. The static mixing element
intimately mixes the components to form a homogeneous
mass that rapidly polymerizes following expulsion from
an outlet of the exit conduit.Double-barreled epoxy dispensing devices are
described in U.S. -A- 5,184,757, US-A- 161,715 and DE-U- 9 100 054
and include separate barrels that each receive a
sausage-shaped foil pack containing one component of a
two-component mixture. These known devices
include a piston
in each barrel, and the pistons are advanced to crush
the foil packs and thereby extrude the components.U.S. -A- 3,323,682 describes a cartridge
for a single-barrel gun-type dispenser, and the
cartridge has an outer shell containing a side-by-side
pair of semi-cylindrical tubes. The tubes are made of
a flexible material such as a plastic film, and
include spouts that dispense components in two, spaced
apart streams as the tubes are collapsed. The
cartridge includes
a rear plug that slides along the inner surface of the
shell and bears against the collapsible tubes to expel
the components.From DE-A-36 16 207 a tube dispensing assembly is known
comprising several rigid tubes arranged in side-by-side
relation to form a cylindrical shape with a circular
cross-section. From EP-A-0 124 852, which represents the prior art as referred to in the
