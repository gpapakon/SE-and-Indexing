<ABSTRACT>
A method of and apparatus for packaging are described in which a fill, form and seal operation is carried out to enclose a product within a series of connected pillow packs. Film (10) forming the pillow packs is printed, preferably on a side which, in use, will be an inside, with markings (12) which can serve as register markings and product (26) detector markings during further treatment and during packing. In a preferred development the continuous length of product (26) within the formed film and end sealed web is fed as a continuous length to packaging apparatus as a secondary product to packaging apparatus wherein a main product is transported along a conveyor. In the apparatus individual pillow backed packages are severed from the continuous length so as to fall one into each main package as it passes a secondary filling station, said markings (12) serving to control operation of a cutting device of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Packaging Method and ApparatusThis invention relates to a method of and apparatus for packaging articles and articles packaged by the apparatus or method.In particular the invention relates to the packaging of articles for use as free gifts in cartons of cereals and other products.It has been the usual practice to place gift packages in cereal cartons by packaging each gift item separately in food quality packaging and dispensing the packaged articles from an apparatus such as a hopper so that one gift package is placed in each cereal carton.However it has been found in practice that it is not uncommon for some cartons not to receive a package at all and for other cartons to receive more than one package. In order to ensure that each carton receives one package only, manually assistance is frequently required in order to ensure that the dispensing apparatus functions correctly.The present invention seeks to provide a packaging method and apparatus and packaged articles produced by the packaging apparatus which will either reduce or eliminate the above problems. 

 Accordingly the present invention provides a packaging apparatus comprising means for feeding a continuous length of packaging material, the material being provided with spaced position indicating markings, means for folding the material into a strip, means for feeding items to be packaged onto the strip at spaced apart intervals r means for sealing the edges of the strip together, and means for sealing the strip laterally between each adjacent packaged item.According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a package containing a number of spaced apart items, each item being separately sealed and located adjacent position indicating markings.The present invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which;Figure l shows a diagrammatic representation of one form of packaging apparatus according to the present invention;Figure 2 shows a schematic form of a side elevation of package sealing apparatus in two positions;Figure 3 shows a sealed package according to the present invention;Figure 4 is a side elevation of a preferred machine for carrying out a first packaging method of the invention; 

 Figure 5 is a schematic view illustrating the packaging method carried out by the machine of Figure 4; andFigure 6 is a schematic illustration showing a further preferred step in a packaging process as carried out using packages made in accordance with the invention.Ref m.. -ing to figure

CLAIMS
1 A packaging apparatus comprising a means for feeding a continuous length of packaging material, the material being provided with spaced position indicating markings, means for folding the material into a strip, means for feeding items to be packaged onto the strip at spaced apart intervals, means for sealing the edges of the strip together, and means for sealing the strip laterally between each adjacent packaged item.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the indicating markings are printed on the side of the packaging which, in use, becomes an inside of a sealed tube.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein said markings are used to determine the introduction of product into the folded web.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein individual products are fed laterally by means of a conveyor to the packaging web, the rate of supply of products along said conveyor being controlled in accordance with the passage of said markings past a sensor
Packaging apparatus substantially as described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawing 


 A package item containing a number of spaced apart products, each item separated from its neighbours by transverse seal line(s) and the or each item having a marking associated with it.
A package as claimed in claim 6 wherein said transverse seal lines are double seal lines with a land therebetween.
A package as claimed in claim 6 or 7 wherein a marking on the web forming the package is associated with each product item.
A package as claimed in claim 6, 7 or 8 wherein the marking is a spacing marking and is provided on an inside surface of a tube forming packaging.
A package as claimed in claim 9 wherein product related printing is provided on the inside surface of the film which is transparent or translucent so as to enable the printing to be read from outside the package.
A package item substantially as described with reference to and as illustrated in the drawings.
A method of packaging including the steps of feeding containers to a filling station and introducing a first, main product, feeding said partly filled packets to a secondary filling station and introducing a secondary 


 product, said secondary product being provided at said filling station in the form of a continuous package item including a chain of interconnected packages each containing an item of secondary product, third individual packages being separated, at the secondary filling station from the bulk of the package item and being caused to enter the package.
A method as claimed in claim 12 wherein markings on the continuous packaging item are used to determine the time of delivery of the package product and time of entry to the packet.
Apparatus for packaging including a conveyor for transporting a series of packets past a first filling head which introduces a first product and past a second filling head wherein a secondary product is introduced, the secondary product being in the form of a product item enclosed within a package, the secondary products being in the form of a continuous chain of products fed to said secondary filling station and individual packages being caused to separate from said continuous length and enter into the packets in synchronism with their movement past the secondary f
a
lling head.
A method as claimed in claim 14 wherein cutting and introduction of said secondary products is effected in accordance with signals from a sensor detecting the 


presence of the said individual packets using markings on the film.
A method of packaging as claimed in claim 14 or 15 wherein the secondary product is formed is a continuous length as in accordance with claim
A method of packaging substantially as described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
