<ABSTRACT>
In an upper tool, a stripper plate (35) is disposed movably up and 
down at a lower end portion (13a) of a punch guide (13) for housing a punch 

(27) also movably up and down, via a shock damping member (33). Further, 
the shock damping member (33) is formed into an annular body disposed so 

as to enclose an annular gap (X) formed between the lower end portion 
(13a) of the punch guide (13) and the upper surface (65) of the stripper plate 

(35). The upper tool can reduce noisy sounds generated during punching 
process, and further prevent chips produced during punching process from 

adhering onto the workpiece and the shock damping member, thus 
protecting the workpiece from being scratched by the chips and further 

improving the life time of the shock damping member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an upper tool used to effect a 
press processing in a plate-shaped workpiece in cooperation with a lower 
tool. Conventionally, in an upper tool mounted on a turret punch press 
for instance, a punch is housed in a cylindrical punch guide so as to be 
movable up and down. Further, the punch guide is formed of a metal, and a 
shock damping material, such as urethane, may be attached to the lower 
end surface of the punch guide. The shock damping material serves to 
reduce a noise generated during the punching process. 
Such an upper tool, according to the pre-characterising part of 
claim 1, is, for example, known from EP-A-0 000 762. In the conventional upper tool whose punch guide is formed of 
only a metal, since the punch guide is directly brought into contact with a 
plate-shaped workpiece, there exists a problem in that a noise is inevitably 
produced during the punching process, thus deteriorating the working 
environment markedly. In case where the shock damping material such as urethane is 
attached to the lower end surface of the punch guide, needle-shaped chips 
(refuse) produced during the punching process may adhere onto the shock 
damping material. Thus, there exists another problem in that the plate-material 
may be scratched by the needle-shaped chips adhered to the 
shock damping material. It is the object of the present invention to overcome the above-mentioned 
problem, and to provide an upper tool which can reduce the 
punching noise and prevent needle-shaped chips from adhering onto the 
upper tool during the punching process.  
 To achieve the above-mentioned object, the present invention 
provides an upper tool according to claim 1 wherein a stripper plate is disposed at a lower 
end portion of a punch guide via a shock damping member 
Further, the shock damping member is an annular body disposed so as 
to enclose an annular gap formed between the lower end portion of the 
punch guide and an upper end portion of the stripper plate (35). As in the upper tool according to the present invention, the 
stripper plate is disposed at the lower end portion of the punch guide via the 
shock damping member, whereby it is possible to reduce the noise 
generated when the stripper plate collides with the workpiece during the 
punching process. This is because a shock can be absorbed by the shock 
damping member. In addition, since the width of the gap between the 
stripper plate and the punch guide is small, it is possible to prevent the 
shock damping member
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An upper tool for a punch press, which punch press includes an upper tool 
holding member, comprising : 


a punch guide (13) adapted to be mounted, in use, on the upper tool 
holding member (3), such as to be movable up and down, the punch guide (13) 

having a lower end portion ; 
a shock damping member (33) mounted on the lower end portion 
of the punch guide (13) ; characterised by 
a stripper plate (35) mounted onto the lower end of the punch 
guide (13) via said shock damping member (33), which is interposed 

between said lower end portion and said stripper plate (35). 
The upper tool of claim 1, wherein said shock damping member 
(33) has an annular shape and is mounted onto the punch guide (13) and the 

stripper plate such as to provide a gap (X) between the punch guide (13) and the 
stripper plate (35). 
The upper tool of claims 2, wherein the height of the gap (X) is 
about 1 mm. 
The upper tool of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the lower end 
portion of the punch guide (13) and the stripper plate (35) are formed each with 

an outer annular recessed groove (51, 61, respectively) and wherein the shock 
damping member (33) is formed with upper and lower inwardly projecting rib 

portions (55), which are spaced from each other so that when engaged in the 
annular groove (51) of the punch guide (13) and the annular groove (61) of the 

stripper plate (35), a gap (X) is provided between the lower face (67) of the 
punch guide (13) and the upper face (65) of the stripper plate (35). 
The upper tool of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a plurality of 
vertical stop pins (63) are inserted vertically into the punch guide (13) through 

the stripper plate (35) and the shock damping member (33) in order to 
prevent the rotation of said stripper plate (35) and said shock damping 

member (33) with respect to said punch guide (13), whereby the lower end of 
said stop pins (63) is spaced away upwardly from the lower face of said 

stripper plate (35) such as to permit the vertical deformation of the shock 
damping member (33) without the workpiece (W) being contacted by said stop 

pins (63). 
The upper tool of anyone of claims 1 to 5, wherein the shock 
damping member (33) is made of urethane.
