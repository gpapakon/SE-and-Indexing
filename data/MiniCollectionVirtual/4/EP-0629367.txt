<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a storage container having a rear wall and a front wall as well as two side walls in which, at the same height, guide rails are present for receiving and moving further containers arranged in the storage container, at least one of the walls being designed so as to be displaceable or pivotable and including guide rails which, after the displacement or pivoting of the wall, engage, in alignment, in the guide rails of the respectively adjacent walls. The storage container can also be disposed as a longitudinal drawer in a piece of furniture and includes transverse drawers which can be pulled out of the storage container transversely to the pull-out direction.

Storage container having a back wall (5) and a
front wall (6) as well as two side walls (2; 3) in

which there are, at the same height, guide grooves (4)
for receiving and moving further containers (19-21)

arranged in the storage container, the further
containers (19-21) being arranged in a plurality of

horizontal planes one on top of the other and one
behind the other and the height of one or more of the

containers (19-21) being greater than the distance
between the guide rails (4), characterized in that at

least one of the walls (5; 6) is composed of two parts
and is of pivotable or displaceable design and likewise

contains guide grooves (4; 12) which, after the
pivoting or displacing of the wall (5; 6) lengthen the

guide grooves (4) of the respectively adjoining side
wall (2; 3) towards the front or towards the rear.
Storage container according to Claim 1,
characterized in that there are bottom walls and top

walls.
Storage container according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the front wall (6) and/or the

back wall (5) is vertically divided and the front wall
parts (7, 8) and rear wall parts (9, 10) formed thereby

are each designed so as to be pivotable about a
vertical axis (17) which is arranged at the adjoining

side walls (2; 3) an the guide grooves (12) of the
pivotable walls (7; 8; 9) [lengthen]
 the guide
grooves (4) of the adjoining walls. 
Storage container according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the front wall parts (7, 8) are

held on the side walls (2, 3) by means of telescopic
guides (37) and can either be pivoted about an axis

(40) into a position of rest parallel to the bottom
face and/or top face or are held parallel to the side

walls (2; 3).
Storage container according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the displaceable walls (7, 8) are

designed as walls parallel to the side walls (2; 3) and
can be pushed into the latter.
Storage container according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the walls (7, 8) can be displaced

by means of a link guide (26).
Storage container according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the side walls (31) are arranged

on horizontal hinge axes (32) on a baseplate (30).
Storage container according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the front wall parts (7, 8) are

mounted in pivot guides (41) on the side walls (2; 3)
and can be guided in a pivoting movement directly

parallel to the side walls (2; 3) from a top position
into a bottom lowered position and in said position

lengthen the side walls (2; 3) towards the front in a
flush alignment.
Storage container according to one of Claims 1
to 8, characterized in that the walls (2; 3; 5; 6) are

also faced on the outside in the manner of furniture.
Storage container according to Claim 1,
characterized in that on the outer faces of the walls

(2; 3; 5; 6) there are guide rails and attachment
devices for inserting the storage container into

another device intended for this purpose.
Storage container according to one of Claims
1-10, characterized in that it is designed as a drawer

(54).
Storage container according to Claim 11,
characterized in that the displacement and/or pivoting 

of the walls (7-10) is carried out in the pulling-out
direction (47) of the drawer (54).
Storage container according to Claim 11,
characterized in that the storage box (1) is initially

displaced in the pulling-out direction (47) of the
drawer (54), and in that the walls (7-10) are displaced

and/or pivoted in a direction (50) which is
perpendicular to the pulling-out direction (47) of the

drawer (54).
