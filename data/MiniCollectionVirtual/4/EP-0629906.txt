<ABSTRACT>
A monitor system for an image printer includes a 
reader (A) for reading color image information of a film (2) 

to be exposed on to a photosensitive material (3), with 
dividing the color image information into a plurality 

of areas. 
In the 

correction mode, the display controller (103) produces the 
display image information corresponding to image 

information read by the reader and concerning a color 
correction film (21A) recording a color chart image 

including a plurality of color components distributed 
separately in a plurality of areas and then causes the 

image display device to display the display image 
information. The image display information is 

corrected based on the correction information inputted 
from the display correction information input device (105) 

and concerning a color to be corrected and correction 
contents. The image display device (M) displays the 

display image information produced by the corrected 
image display calculation information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a monitor system
for an image printer.A monitor system for an image printer is intended
for allowing appropriate correction of various
exposure conditions by causing image display means
such as a CRT to display predictable result of
exposure before the exposure of color image
information of a film is effected by exposure means.
For the appropriate correction of the exposure
conditions, the correction is made so that the image
displayed by the image display means may be identical
to the resultant image exposed by the exposure means.More specifically, supposing a monitor mode is
instructed by mode instructing means; then, after
color image information of a film is read by reader
means, exposure condition calculating means for 
obtaining exposure conditions proceeds to obtain
exposure conditions based on the read image
information and exposure condition calculation
information. Then, image information correcting means
produces exposure-conditioned image information based
on the read image information and the exposure
conditions. Next, display control means produces
display image information based on the exposure-conditioned
image information and image display
calculation information and causes image display means
to display the display image information as a color
image.Accordingly, by viewing the color image displayed
on the image display means, an operator may judge
whether an appropriate exposure is possible or not.
If it is judged that the exposure will be
inappropriate; then, correction information for
correcting color or density will be inputted to
exposure correcting information input means such as a
keyboard device to correct the exposure condition
calculation information. Incidentally, in general,
when the exposure condition calculation information is
corrected; then, based on this correction, display
image information is reproduced to be displayed on the
image display means to allow the operator to confirm 
also the appropriateness of the correction of the
exposure condition calculation information.In case the monitor system is integrated with the
image printer, the exposure conditions obtained by the
exposure condition calculating means are directly
outputted to the exposure means to be used thereby for
the exposure operation.On the other hand, in case the monitor system is
provided separately from the image printer, the
exposure conditions obtained by the exposure condition
calculating means are once stored at a storage medium
such as a floppy disc, and then,
