<ABSTRACT>
Arrangement for calibration of at least one radiation-sensitive detector means, whereby the arrangement comprises an aperture (90), and at least one reference body (50, 60, 600) which emits radiation with a measurable intensity. The arrangement further comprises a deflection member (160, 170, 620) which deflects radiation from the reference body, and at least one radiation-sensitive detector means (30) which detects the radiation value and generates an output signal dependent on the detected radiation value. The deflection member is arranged to reproduce the aperture (90) on the reference body (50, 60, 600) and the deflection member (160, 170, 620) deflects the radiation such that the midpoint of the reproduction of the aperture (90) remains on substantially the same surface of the reference body (50, 60, 600) during that time period in which the detector means receives radiation which is transmitted from the reference body and which passes through the aperture (90).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement according 
to the preamble of claim 1. Within the field of image recording, such as thermal 
cameras for example, it is known to make use of an optical 
line sweep system in which an object is scanned at high 
speed along a line with the aid of a rotating drum provided 
with continuous reflecting faces arranged around the drum. 
An image sweep perpendicular to the line can also be 
achieved, for example using a rocking mirror or a second 
drum which rotates at a lower speed than the drum for the 
line sweep. In this manner the object is scanned in grid 
form. The radiation is transmitted through such a system 
via one or more deflection members such as lenses or 
mirrors to one or more radiation detectors. The radiation 
detector or detectors also receive radiation from one or 
more reference bodies which constitute sources of radiation 
such as, for example, infra-red radiation. It is known to 
arrange the reference body in such a manner that both the 
object and the reference body are scanned during one sweep, 
whereby the image sweep scans the reference body at the 
start and finish respectively of the sweep. In most types of optical sweep systems with drums provided 
with mirrored faces which function as sweep-generating 
elements, the faces are normally installed so that they 
reflect in a collimated radiation path. The radiation beam 
which is reflected by the faces and other deflection 
members thus has a certain width. There are however sweep 
systems in which the faces are arranged in convergent or 
divergent radiation paths.  
 Even with convergent or divergent radiation paths, the 
radiation beam must however have a certain width. Because 
of the width of the radiation beam, difficulties are 
created with double imaging which arises in connection with 
the switching of the radiation path between two faces. This 
arises because radiation during switching from one face to 
another face will arrive at the detector from two directions, 
i.e. radiation coming simultaneously from both the 
rear portion of one face and from the front portion of the 
next face on the drum. These two radiation beams originate 
from separate parts of the object and thus give rise to 
double imaging during a portion of the sweep. This double 
imaging effect implies that not all of the sweep can be 
used, which explains why the sweep efficiency of such 
arrangements is not as high as is desirable. By analogy with the above, a double imaging effect arises 
during the
