<ABSTRACT>
In a method of transferring goods into a container 
83
, the container 

83
 is tilted toward a goods loader 
18
, and a goods transferring member 
90
 with 
goods accommodated therein is inserted into an upper empty space in the tilted 

container 
83
. Thereafter, the goods transferring member 
90
 is tilted downward, and 
in this tilted state, it is withdrawn to the outside of the container 
83
, thus effecting 
the transfer of the goods in it into the container 
83
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for 
transferring goods to containers. There is known in the prior art, a goods loader, in which goods on 
a goods transferring member are transferred to an empty container by a goods 
push-plate. Also, known is a goods collection system, in which a goods loader is 
provided at each of a plurality of positions along a container conveying line for 
transferring successive goods to containers with the individual goods loaders. In the prior art, however, there are the following problems. 
1 ○ Since goods on a goods transferring member are pushed by the 
goods push-out plate toward the container so that they fall thereinto, the goods can 
not be transferred in a neatly arranged form. 2 ○ Goods received by a conveyor can be transferred only to empty 
containers. Therefore, it is impossible to successively transfer goods having been 
received in a plurality of goods receptacles on the conveyor to a next conveyor or 
to add goods to a container, which also contains goods transferred from a different 
goods collection unit. Therefore, it is possible to accommodate only a small 
quantity of goods in the container, and the goods accommodation efficiency is low. 
Further, a large number of containers are necessary, and the goods collection 
capacity is low. 3 ○ When containers are successively conveyed toward a plurality of 
goods loaders, they are held in a horizontal state. Therefore, unstable goods, such  
 
as flat bolts, are turned down in the container in a conveying process 
after they have been transferred into the container. The form of 
arrangement of goods in the container is thus readily disturbed to 
deteriorate the performance of handling goods in the subsequent steps. In US-A-3 687 446 there are disclosed a method and device 
for transferring metal plates to containers comprising the steps of 
inserting a transferring member with metal plates accomodated therein 
into an upper empty space in a tilted container, then tilting the 
transferring member downward and withdrawing the transferring 
member in the tilted state outside of the container thus effecting the 
transfer of the metal plates from the transferring member to the 
container. The method and device of US-A-3 687 446 do not allow 
transferring goods from a transferring member to a container in a 
neatly arranged form. It is an object of the present invention to permit, when 
transferring goods from a goods transferring member to a container, 
transferring the goods in a neatly

A goods transfer apparatus for transferring goods from a 
goods reception conveyor (17) to containers (83) with a goods loader 

(18), 

the goods loader (18) serving to push goods collected in the 
goods reception conveyor (17) with goods push-out means (81) at a 

goods discharge position so as to push out the goods to a goods feeder 
unit (80) disposed sidewise so that the goods can be transferred from 

the goods feeder unit (80) to a container (83), said goods feeder unit including a goods 
transferring member (90) for accommodating goods; characterized in 

that said goods transfer apparatus comprises a container orientation 
controller (84) for tilting a container toward the goods loader (18) and 

the goods feeder unit (80) further includes: 
a slide driver (92) for causing movement of the goods 
transferring member (90) to given extents in the both directions of the 

goods reception conveyor (17) and the container (83); 
a tilt driver (93) for causing the goods transferring member 
(90) to be tilted together with the slide driver (92); 
a revolution driver (95) for causing the goods transferring 
member (90) to be revolved by 180 degrees together with the slide 

driver (92) and the tilt driver (93) from a state directed to the goods 
reception conveyor (17) to a state directed to the container (83); and 
a lifter (96) for raising and lowering the goods transferring 
member (90) together with the slide driver (92), the tilt driver (93) 

and the revolution driver (95) to change the level height of the goods 
transferring member (90), thereby raising and lowering the position of 

insertion of the goods transferring member into the container. 
A method of collecting goods in a container using the 
goods transfer apparatus as set forth in claim 1 comprising the steps 

of: 

causing the goods transferring member (90) to be projected 
toward a goods reception conveyor (17) with the slide driver (92) for 

receiving goods pushed out from the goods reception conveyor (17);  
 
the goods transferring member being caused by the revolution 
driver (95) to be revolved by 180 degrees toward the container (83) 

when the container is empty, and when the container is not empty, the 
goods transferring member (90) being caused by the revolution driver 

(95) to be revolved by 180 degrees toward the container and at the 
same time caused by the lifter (96) to be raised up to a position above 

goods having already been inserted in the container; 
then causing the goods transferring member (90) to be moved 
and inserted into the container by the slide driver (92); 
then causing the goods transferring member (90) to be tilted 
together with the slide driver (92) by the tilt driver (93), thus causing 

the goods to be supported by the bottom of the container; 
then causing the goods transferring member (90) to be moved 
away from the container by the slide driver (92), thus withdrawing the 

goods transferring member while leaving the goods alone in the 
container; and 
after the withdrawal of the goods transferring member (90), 
returning the tilt driver (93) and causing the goods transferring 

member (90) to be revolved by 180 degrees toward the goods reception 
conveyor by the revolution driver (95), thus returning the goods 

transferring member (90) to the initial position. 
The method of claim 2, wherein goods loaders (18) are 
disposed at each of a plurality of positions along a conveying line (19) 

for conveying containers (83) therealong, the containers (83) being 
conveyed between adjacent goods loaders (18) in a state tilted toward 

the goods loaders (18) while goods are successively transferred to the 
container by each goods loader (18).
