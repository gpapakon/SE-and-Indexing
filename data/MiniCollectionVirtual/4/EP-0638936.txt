<ABSTRACT>
A gate array LSI having functional blocks 
formed by interconnecting a plurality of basic cells 

(10) arranged on a semiconductor substrate in matrix 
form and either signal conductive patterns (7) or 

first power conductive patterns (5). The first power 
conductive patterns (5) are disposed on the plurality 

of basic cells (10) arranged in line and are divided 
and disposed on the basic cells so that the signal 

conductive pattern (7) is interposed therebetween. 
It is therefore possible to improve the efficiency of 

wiring macrocells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated
circuit, and particularly to a gate array LSI.As a conventional gate array LSI, there is known one
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication
No. 3-69163. The gate array LSI is one of a type that a plurality
of basic cells each comprised of an NMOSFET having an N-type
diffused region and a PMOSFET having a P-type diffused region are
arranged in matrix form. Further, the gate array LSI is provided
with a dedicated signal conductive pattern or conductor used for
a clock signal and a test facilitation circuit. The dedicated
signal conductor is used to suppress or control a reduction in
performance of the clock signal and facilitate a test. A
functional block such as a NAND circuit, an OR circuit or the like
has been constructed by interconnecting the dedicated signal
conductor, basic cells and a plurality of macrocells corresponding
to wiring patterns with each other.In the basic cells for the gate array LSI, basic cell patterns
fabricated on a semiconductor substrate in advance and patterns
for the signal conductor and a power conductive pattern or
conductor have no symmetry in directions vertical and horizontal
to the semiconductor substrate. It has thus been desirable to
improve the efficiency of wiring the macrocells of the same
patterns. In GB-A-2134708 there is described a distribution line arrangement
primarily for VLSI chips in which the clock line is shielded by providing
ground lines on either side. A similar arrangement is described in Patent
Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 14, No. 216 (E-0924) in which the clock signal
wiring is positioned between electric source wiring used to supply currents
at different potentials.The present invention seeks to provide a gate array LSI capable of
improving the efficiency of wiring macrocells.According to the invention, there is provided a gate array LSI having
a semiconductor substrate on which a plurality of basic cells are arranged
in a matrix, said gate array LSI comprising a first conductor for transmitting
signals, two second conductors for supplying power and a third conductor
for supplying power, wherein said third conductor is divided into two electrically connected lines,
said first conductor being interposed between and parallel to said two lines,
said gate array LSI being characterised in that said basic cells are arranged
in pairs, in which the first basic cell of each pair comprises a first diffusion
region, and the second basic cell of each pair comprises a second diffusion
region
