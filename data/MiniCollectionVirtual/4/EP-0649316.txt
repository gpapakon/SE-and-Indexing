<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to programmable drug
infusion pumps.Infusion pumps as used in the field of health care
are electromechanical devices which control the flow rate
of medical fluids. An example of a drug infusion pump is
the AS40AÂ® Infusion Pump by Baxter Healthcare Inc. It
operates a medical syringe to deliver a drug to a patient
at a precisely controlled rate. The AS40A employs an
active fluid pumping mechanism, i.e., positive
displacement of the syringe plunger, to expel fluid from
the syringe. This type of pump is generally known as a
syringe pump.A vital application for infusion pumps in the
human and veterinary medical field is in the delivery of
chemicals, drugs, nutrition, or biological products to
patients. Typically, in these applications, one or more
drugs or other substances are mixed into a uniform
solution in a medical fluid and are then delivered
through an infusion pump into the bloodstream of a
recipient via tubing and/or catheters which conduct the
fluid from the pump to the recipient's vascular space.The fluid flow rate or sequence of rates at which
an infusion pump operates are typically selected based on
a desired pattern of drug delivery appropriate to the
specific circumstance. There are numerous factors that
should be considered in the process of specifying a
specific rate of fluid flow from a pump at a particular
moment in time. Those factors may include:
(i) the nature of the substance being infused,
including the known pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of a drug; (ii) the concentration or dilution of the substance in
the fluid;(iii) the recipient, including sex, age, various
measures of weight or size, the state of function
of various organ systems, and ability to tolerate
infusion of various diluent fluid volumes;(iv) the occurrence of change in measurable endpoints
related to the actions or effects of the substance
being infused;(v) the difference between the estimated concentration
of the drug at the target site of drug action (as
computed based upon actual measurements or based
upon pharmacokinetic models and the prior history
of the infusion and/or other factors), as compared
to the desired concentration;(vi) local practices, policies, protocols, and
regulations; or(vii) other considerations including operator judgement.The process by which a patient care-giver takes
the above considerations into account and chooses fluid
flow rates for drug delivery from a pump is complex and
if done incorrectly can lead to serious problems. The
process is prone to error,

<CLAIMS>
A system for use with a computer, said system comprising:

a storage medium containing a drug library (90), said
drug library containing a plurality of drug entries, there

being associated with each drug entry a set of associated
drug delivery information for configuring a programmable drug

infusion pump, said storage medium being readable by the computer,
a programme (94) that runs on said computer, said programme
comprising:
means for enabling a user of said computer to select a
set of multiple drug entries from among said plurality of

drug entries in said drug library;
means for enabling the user to add the selected drug entries
along with the sets of drug delivery information associated

therewith to a customized library (96); and
means for enabling the user to cause said computer to
electronically load the customized library into the drug infusion

pump as a library resident in said pump.
The system of claim 1 further comprising means for enabling
the user to create a drug configuration within the

customized library that does not exist in the drug library,
and/or comprising means for enabling the user to edit an

existing drug configuration in the customized library.
A drug infusion pump (10) for use with a container (28)
containing a particular drug, said pump comprising:


a drive mechanism (37, 53) which during operation causes
the particular drug to be delivered to a patient from the

container;
a programmable controller (40) controlling the drive
mechanism;
an electronically loadable memory (48) inside the pump,
said electronically loadable memory storing a drug library;
input circuitry (12, 50) through which the electronically
loadable memory can be electronically loaded with said drug

library, said drug library containing a plurality of drug entries,
there being associated 
with each drug entry a set of
associated drug delivery parameters and/or drug delivery protocols

for configuring the drug infusion pump;
a user interface (12) enabling a user to program the programmable
controller, said user interface comprising:
means for enabling (12) a user to select a drug entry
from the electronically loaded drug library; and 
means for configuring (12) the programmable controller
with the set of drug delivery parameters associated with the

selected drug.
The drug infusion pump of claim 3 wherein said container
is a syringe, said drive mechanism operates said syringe,

and/or said electronically loadable memory is non-volatile
memory.
The drug infusion pump of claim 3 wherein each of the associated
sets of drug delivery parameters includes information

selected from a group of parameters including drug concentration,
drug delivery rate, drug dose, and bolus size.
The drug infusion pump of claim 3 wherein said electronically
loaded drug library contains a list of available mode

options, said mode options specifying the units available for
expressing drug delivery information, and wherein said drug

infusion pump offers the user the list of available mode options
from which to make a selection when the electronically

loaded drug library is in said pump.
The drug infusion pump of claim 3 wherein said electronically
loaded drug library contains a list of names of syringe

manufacturers, said names of syringe manufacturers identifying
syringes that can be used in the drug infusion pump, and

wherein said drug infusion pump offers the user the list of
names of syringe manufacturers from which to make a selection

when the electronically loaded drug library is in said pump,
and/or wherein said electronically loaded drug library contains

a list of syringe sizes, said selected syringe sizes
identifying syringes that can be used in the drug infusion

pump, and wherein said drug infusion pump offers the user the 
list of syringe sizes from which to make a selection when the

electronically loaded drug library is in said pump.
