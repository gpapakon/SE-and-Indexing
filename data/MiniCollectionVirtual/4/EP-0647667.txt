<ABSTRACT>
Polyurethanes which can be dispersed in water without an emulsifier, obtainable by partial reaction of an isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymer with a salt of an acid containing a hydrogen atom which is reactive towards isocyanate, and subsequently reacting the remaining isocyanate groups with a chain extender, and the use thereof in binders for coating compositions and adhesives.

<CLAIMS>
A polyurethane which can be dispersed in water
without emulsifier and is obtained by partial reaction of

an isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymer with a salt
of an acid which is monofunctional toward isocyanate by

means of a reactive hydrogen atom, followed by reaction
of the remaining isocyanate groups with a chain-extending

agent, which comprises the quantity of salt being chosen
such that from 20 to 80% of the terminal isocyanate

groups of the prepolymer are reacted.
An aqueous polyurethane dispersion as claimed in
claim 1, obtained by dispersing in water the urethane

prepolymer which has been reacted with the salt, and then
adding a chain-extending agent which then reacts with the

remaining isocyanate groups.
An aqueous polyurethane dispersion as claimed in
claim 1, obtained by adding a chain-extending agent to

the urethane prepolymer which has been reacted with the
salt, in a small quantity of water, and then reacting

this chain-extending agent with the remaining isocyanate
groups, followed by dilution with a larger quantity of

water.
An aqueous polyurethane dispersion as claimed in
claim 1, obtained by adding a chain-extending agent

together with the total quantity of dispersion water to
the urethane prepolymer which has been reacted with the

salt, and then reacting the chain-extending agent with
the remaining isocyanate groups.
An aqueous polyurethane dispersion as claimed in
claim 1, obtained by partial hydrolysis of the remaining

terminal isocyanate groups of the urethane prepolymer
which has been reacted with the salt, to give terminal

amino groups, which are then reacted with the remaining
terminal isocyanate groups of the nonhydrolyzed urethane 

prepolymers, with chain extension taking place.
A polyurethane which can be dispersed in water
without emulsifier, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the

isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymer is reacted with
taurine in solid form or as a solution.
A binder for coating compositions and adhesives,
which contains a dispersion as claimed in claim 1.
