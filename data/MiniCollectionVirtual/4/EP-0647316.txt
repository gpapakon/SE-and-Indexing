<ABSTRACT>
This integrated device for instantly identifying, qualitatively and quantitatively, a physico-chemical entity or a plurality of such entities contained in or on a sample, and liable to return one or more emission or absorption or reflectance spectra when excited by an electromagnetic wave, comprises, within a shielded housing (1): a polychromator (5) to which the emission, absorption or reflectance spectrum or spectra from the analysed sample are directed; a detection unit (6) for said signals, positioned on the optical path of the signals emitted by the polychromator (5); a conversion circuit (6) coupled to said polychromator (5), a central processing unit (7) integrating, in an associated memory, a plurality of standard spectra representative of known and predetermined entities, for analysing the digital spectrum or spectra thus obtained, for comparing, following a decorrelation process, the spectrum or spectra with the spectra stored in said memory, and for deducting, from this comparison, the nature and concentration of the predetermined physico-chemical entity or entities in or on the sample.
