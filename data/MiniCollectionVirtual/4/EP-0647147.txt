<ABSTRACT>
A catheter for use in angioplasty and other medical procedures is disclosed. The catheter features a flexible wire mesh tip (2) movably attached at a distal end of the catheter (1), the tip being expandable from a contracted position which it is first in when the catheter is deployed inside the lumen of a vessel, to stretch open the lumen and eliminate a flow obstruction therein, such as is caused by plaque deposits; the tip subsequently being returnable to its contracted position inside the catheter when the catheter is withdrawn from the lumen of the vessel. Radio frequency energy may additionally be used to weld the source of the flow obstruction to the wall of the lumen leaving a conduit of sufficiently expanded diameter to allow resumption of normal flow in the vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
Catheters having inflatable balloons mounted on their distal ends are a
commonly used apparatus for entering blood vessels to expand and open strictures at
remote sites in a non-invasive manner.In conventional balloon catheters, vessel expansion is achieved by inflating the
balloon on the catheter tip at the site of the obstruction. The balloon expands radially
outward, thereby expanding the place in the blood vessel where it is located.One disadvantage of the conventional balloon catheter is that blood flow
through the lumen of the vessel in which the balloon is to be inflated, which is already
severely reduced because of the stricture, is momentarily completely cut-off when the
balloon is inflated and exerting pressure against the stricture-causing mass and/or wall
of the vessel. If such a condition is maintained for an extended period of time it is
possible that damage to or necrosis of the tissue material of the vessel wall may occur.Accurate control of the extent of inflation of the balloon may also be difficult to
achieve in some circumstances with conventional balloon catheters. If inflation is not
carefully monitored and controlled, it is possible to overinflate the balloon which in turn
may cause a stretching and weakening of the vessel wall.In the particular application of balloon catheters to angioplasty, moreover, there
Is a possibility, which occurs at a frequency on the order of about 5% of the cases, of
the abrupt reclosure of an expanded artery after balloon angioplasty. This is generally
due to a dissection of the arterial wall obstructing the lumen, to elastic recoil of the
arterial wall, or to spontaneous spasm of the arterial wall.DE-U-9109006
upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based
describes an angioplasty catheter in which a mesh is used to hold
open the blood vessel. The mesh has a coil structure which has an intrinsic expanded
configuration. The catheter comprises an outer retractable sheath which will keep the mesh
in a tight, reduced configuration before deployment. The sheath is removed to allow the
mesh to expand.EP-A-0416662 describes a vascular catheter having an expandable cage mounted
on the distal end of a tubular member which may be radially expanded and contracted by
means of a control wire which is secured to the distal end of the expandable cage. Accordingly, a catheter featuring a novel means of lumen expansion at its distal
end has been developed. The present invention utilizes an expandable wire mesh tip
attached to the distal end of the catheter, wherein the

<CLAIMS>
A catheter (1) for insertion into the lumen of a vessel and comprising a body (23) in
the form of a rod, a tube and an open coil having a longitudinal axis and attached to which

at a distal end (25) thereof is a wire or plastics mesh tubular tip (2) substantially co-axial with
said body (23), said mesh tip (2) having a proximal end attached to said distal end of the

body (3) and a distal end which are displaceable longitudinally relative to each other causing
the mesh tip (2) to expand diametrically relative to the longitudinal axis for enlarging an

effective inner diameter of the lumen or causing the mesh tip to contract diametrically relative
to the longitudinal axis between a fully expanded condition and a contracted condition, said

mesh tip (2) having shape restoring properties which provide the tip with a default condition
and wherein a sheath (15) is provided on said body (23) and longitudinally movable relative

thereto for the mesh tip (2) in its contracted condition to be receivable axially in said sheath
(15) to be retained in its contracted condition and control means (15, 23) which controls

relative axial displacement between the sheath (15) and the mesh tip (2) whereby the sheath
(15) is removable from the tip (2) to permit the mesh tip (2) to expand from its contracted

condition, the material of the mesh for said tip (2) having intrinsic shape restoring properties
which provide the tip (2) with a default position corresponding to said fully expanded condition

whereby in the absence of a restraining force (15, 18) the mesh tip (2) will adopt its fully
expanded condition; CHARACTERISED IN THAT a draw string means (18) displaceable

longitudinally relative to the body (15) for controlling expansion of the mesh tip (2), woven
through the proximal end of the wire mesh tip (2) as a purse string and longitudinal

displacement of which draw string relative to the body (15) serves to apply to the mesh tip
a restraining force against said shape restoring properties and by which the mesh tip (2) can

be contracted to or towards its contracted condition.
A catheter as claimed in Claim 1 in which the sheath means is displaced axially
relative to the mesh tip (2) in a direction axially towards the proximal end of the catheter to

cause the mesh tip to adopt, under control of the draw string means (18), an expanded
condition from its contracted condition and in an axially opposite direction to cause the

sheath to apply the restraining force to the mesh tip for the mesh tip to be restrained in its
contracted condition.
A catheter as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which the control means for
effecting the relative axial displacement between the sheath (15) and the mesh tip (2)

comprises at least one of a rod, a tube or an open coil (23). 
A catheter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which the draw string
(18) is carried within a lumen of the body (15).
A catheter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which the mesh tip (2)
is fabricated in a braided, woven or knot pattern.

wire (17) extending axially through a catheter and over which guide wire the catheter (1) can

be advanced for facilitating placement of the catheter in the lumen of a vessel.

has at least part of its outer surface area and said wire mesh tip (2) has at least part of its

surface area which is intended to come into contact with body fluid in the lumen of a vessel
coated with at least one of a non-thrombogenic material and an elastomeric material.
A catheter as claimed in Claim 7 in which said elastomeric material is selected from
thermoplastics elastomers and silicone.
A catheter as claimed in Claim 8 in which the thermoplastics elastomers comprise
polyurethane and polyethylene.
A catheter as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims and comprising a wire (8a,
8b) for transmitting electromagnetic energy into flow-obstructing material in the lumen to

cause an attenuation of the flow-obstructing material, said wire being carried within a lumen
of the body (1) and connected to said mesh tip (2).
A catheter as claimed in Claim 10 in which said wire (8a, 8b) extends the length of
the body of the catheter (1) from a proximal end of said body to its distal end, said wire being

positioned in an annulus formed between an inner diameter of the sheath (1, 15) and said
