<ABSTRACT>
A first sample measuring passage(12) provided 
between a collection port(4) and a suction pump(10) has a 

sample gas measurer(14) for measuring expiration 
components, while a second sample measuring passage(16) 

which is provided in parallel with the first sample 
measuring passage(12) has a standard gas measurer(18) for 

measuring O₂ gas. Assuming that [A] represents a 

measured value of a target component in an expiration 
sample and [b₁]
 represents O₂ concentration in the 
expiration sample, correction is made on the basis of:



[A'] = f₁·(21-[a₁]
)[A]/(21-[b₁]
) 



 
where [A']
 represents the corrected measured value of the 
target component, [a₁]
 represents O₂ concentration in end-tidal 
air which is supplied as a constant such as 15.3, 

for example, and f₁ represents an experimentally 
prescribed coefficient such as 1.67, for example.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
correcting componential concentration which is measured
for analyzing expiration of a subject with an analyzer
such as a gas chromatograph, and an analyzer for
implementing such a method.It has been recognized that expiration of a sick
person also contains information on his disease, and
study is now being made on analysis of such expiration in
a clinical test which is made for diagnosing, curing or
preventing the disease.In expiration which is subjected to analysis, a part
called end-tidal air is most suitably employed as a
sample for the analyser. The end-tidal air is the
remaining part of the expiration from which an initial
part containing air from a dead space is discarded.
Since the end-tidal air contains only alveolar air with 
homogeneous concentration off expiration components, it is
excellent as a specimen. In an expiration test,
therefore, the end-tidal air is measured as the most
reliable specimen expressing the state of the subject,
while a specific apparatus is required for collecting the
end-tidal air.On the other hand, it may be impossible or difficult
to test the end-tidal air, for some reason or other. For
example, it is difficult to collect the end-tidal air
from a subject such as a baby, a child, a soporose
patient or an unconscious patient. If the subject is
healthy but old, for example, it may also be difficult to
test the end-tidal air in consideration of his physical
strength.In order to readily collect expiration in a painless
manner, a collecting mask or hood is applied to the
subject for temporarily collecting his expiration in a
bag or directly guiding the same to an analyzer.
However, the collecting mask, which can be prepared from
that for supplying oxygen to a patient, cannot be brought
into close contact with the subject in an airtight manner
but the mask itself has holes for communicating with
ambient air. When the expiration is collected through
such a collecting mask, ambient air is inevitably mixed
into the expiration. While it is also possible to 
collect the expiration by applying a mask or a hood to or
covering the respiratory organ, ambient air is also
inevitably mixed into the expiration since the
respiratory organ cannot be sealed.Thus, the expiration which is collected by a
conventional method contains not only the alveolar air
but air from the dead space and ambient air, unless the
game is collected by a specific method. WO83/00613 discloses an end tidal carbon dioxide gas analyzer
for measuring a carbon dioxide
