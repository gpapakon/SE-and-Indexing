<ABSTRACT>
A method for designing a second ink-jet cartridge 
(100) characterized by a datum structure, an ink reservoir 

system and a printhead structure, given a first cartridge 
design (50), wherein the printhead structure of the two 

cartridges are different. The method uses a common datum 
structure and ink reservoir system for both the first and 

second cartridges, to save on development and tooling 
expenses. The cartridges (50, 100) differ in the shapes or 

configurations of the headland structures, the flexible 
interconnect circuits, the nozzle plates, the ink channels 

or the printhead substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink-jet printers, and
more particularly to improvements in a common cartridge
platform used for different printheads.Ink-jet printers are in widespread use today for
printing functions in personal computer, facsimile and
other applications. Such printers typically include
replaceable print cartridges which hold a supply of ink and
carry the ink-jet printhead. The cartridge typically is
secured into a printer carriage which supports one or a
plurality of cartridges above the print medium, and traverses
the medium in a direction transverse to the direction
of medium travel through the printer. Electrical
connections are made to the printhead by flexible wiring
circuits attached to the outside of the cartridge. Each
printhead includes a number of tiny nozzles defined in a
substrate and nozzle plate structure which are selectively
fired by electrical signals applied to interconnect pads to
eject droplets of ink in a controlled fashion onto the
print medium.In order to achieve accurate printing quality, each
removable cartridge includes datum surfaces which engage
against corresponding carriage surfaces to precisely locate
the cartridge when inserted into the carriage. In this 
manner, when a cartridge ink supply is exhausted, the cartridge
may be replaced with a fresh cartridge, and the
printhead of the new cartridge will be precisely located
relative to the carriage.As improvements have been made in the printhead design
or in the ink delivery system for cartridges, it has been
the common design practice to design entirely new printer
cartridges, incurring expenses in the design and tooling
for the new cartridges. Thus, if a new printhead is
developed which has different physical size parameters from
an earlier design of a printhead, advancing for the sake of
example, from a 180 dpi to a 300 dpi resolution, the common
practice has been to develop an entirely new cartridge
platform to support the new printhead, including different
datum surfaces, and indeed, requiring a new printer carriage
to support the cartridge.It is known, in a one-cartridge printer application,
to change the nozzle firing frequency, along with the width
of the ink feed slots in the substrate die, without changing
the datum structure or ink delivery system in an ink-jet
cartridge, to achieve improved printing performance.In a series of printers marketed by Hewlett-Packard
Company, the "Deskjet" series, two different cartridges are
available for use in the same printer, one having a relatively
lower ink
