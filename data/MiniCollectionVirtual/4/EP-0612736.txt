<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the preparation of 5-cyano-4-lower-alkyl-oxazoles, in which 5-carbamoyl-4-lower-alkyl-oxazoles are dehydrated with cyanuric chloride and N,N-dimethylformamide under mild conditions, if appropriate in the presence of a further solvent.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of 5-cyano-4-(C
1-6
-alkyl)-oxazoles
by dehydrating a 5-carbamoyl-4-(C
1-6
-alkyl)-oxazole, characterized
in that the dehydration is carried out with cyanogen chloride and N,N-disubstituted

formamides, optionally in the presence of an additional solvent.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that N,N-dimethylformamide
is used as the N,N-disubstituted formamide.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
dehydration is carried out temperatures of about 0°-50°C, preferably at about

room temperature.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the dehydration is carried out using a 5-carbamoyl-4-(C
1-6
-alkyl)-oxazole:cyanogen
chloride molar ratio of about 3:1 to 3:10, preferably of

about 3:1 to 1:1, particularly about 2:1.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the dehydration with cyanogen chloride and N,N-disubstituted

formamides is carried out in the presence of methyl tert.-butyl ether as the
additional solvent.
