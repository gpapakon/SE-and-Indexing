<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention allows the manufacture of a memory card comprising a body (1) provided with an integrated circuit (3) including pads (4, 4a) which are connected electrically to read/write contacts (9, 9a) by conductors (8, 8a). It consists in depositing a layer of dielectric varnish (6) on the integrated circuit (3), except on the pads of the latter, in making a cavity (2) in the body (1), in providing the latter with a conduction land (5) situated partly in the cavity and partly outside it, in applying the layer (6) against an adhesive tape (7, 7a), in introducing the integrated circuit (3) into the cavity (2), in applying the free part of the adhesive tape (7, 7a) to the body (1) of the card, in forming the read/write contacts (9, 9a) and the conductors (8, 8a) by depositing a conducting ink on the adhesive tape (7, 7a), this allowing electrical links between the pads (4, 4a) and the conductors (8, 8a) as well as between the conduction land (5) and one (8a) of the said conductors, and in forming a second layer of dielectric varnish (10) on the adhesive tape and on the assembly except on the read/write contacts (8, 8a).

A process for the production of a memory card comprising a
body (1) of insulating material provided with an integrated circuit (3),

having a top surface covered by a dielectric layer (6) except over
terminals (4, 4a) that conductors (8, 8a) of conductive ink electrically

connect to read/write contacts (9, 9a), the process comprising a step which
involves providing a cavity (2) in the body (1) of the card and the steps

of applying to each other the dielectric layer (6) and an adhesive face of
an adhesive strip (7, 7a) whose dimensions are larger than those of the

integrated circuit, introducing the integrated circuit (3) into the cavity
(2), its terminals (4, 4a) being directed outwardly, applying the free part

of the adhesive face of the adhesive strip (7, 7a) to the body (1) of the
card, at the periphery of the cavity (2), forming the read/write contacts

(9, 9a) and the conductors (8, 8a) by the deposit of a conductive ink on
another face of the adhesive strip (7, 7a), which is capable of permitting

electrical connections between the terminals (4, 4a) and the conductors (8,
8a), and forming a second dielectric layer (10) on the adhesive strip and

on the parts of the ink deposit which do not constitute the read/write
contacts (9, 9a).
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the
adhesive strip (7) used comprises holes (11, 12) distributed in such a way

that they are in line with the terminals (4, 4a) of the integrated circuit
(3) when said adhesive strip and the integrated circuit (3) are applied to

each other, the conductive ink providing the electrical connections by
filling the holes. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the

adhesive strip (7a) used is capable of locally becoming an electrical
conductor under the action of a pressure (P) applied thereto

perpendicularly to the plane thereof, and that a pressure is applied to the
parts of the adhesive strip (7a) which are disposed in line with the

terminals (4, 4a) in such a fashion that the pressed parts of the adhesive
strip (7a) electrically connect the conductive ink to the terminals (4,

4a).
A process according to claim 2 or claim 3 characterised in
that prior to the step of introducing the integrated circuit (3) into the

cavity (2) it comprises the step of producing a conduction portion (5)
comprising an internal part disposed in the cavity and an external part

disposed outside the cavity, and that the adhesive strip (7, 7a) is capable
of permitting an electrical connection between the external part of the

conduction portion (5) and one (8a) of the conductors.
A memory card comprising a body (1) of insulating material
having a cavity (2) in which there is disposed an integrated circuit (3)

having terminals (4, 4a) which are directed outwardly and comprising a
first dielectric layer (6) extending over the top face of the integrated

circuit except the terminals (4, 4a) thereof, conductors (8, 8a) of
conductive synthetic resin connecting the terminals (4. 4a) to read/write

contacts (9, 9a) and a second dielectric layer (10) extending over the
conductors (8, 8a), characterised in that an adhesive strip (7, 7a) is

fixed by an adhesive face to the first dielectric layer (6) and to the body
(1) around the cavity (2), and that the conductors (8, 8a) and the

read/write contacts (9, 9a) to which they are connected extend on another
face of the adhesive strip (7, 7a).
A memory card according to claim 1 characterised in that the
strip (7) comprises holes (11. 12) in line with the terminals (4, 4a) of 

the integrated circuit (3) and that the conductors (8, 8a) extend in the
holes.
A memory card according to claim 5 characterised in that the
strip (7a) comprises conductive parts in line with the terminals (4. 4a) of

the integrated circuit (3) and that the conductors (8. 8a) extend over said
conductive parts.
A memory card according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised in
that it comprises a conduction portion (5) comprising an internal part

disposed in the cavity (2) in contact with the integrated circuit and an
external part disposed outside the cavity, electrically connected to one

(8a) of the conductors.
A memory card according to claim 8 characterised in that the
conduction portion (5) is of conductive synthetic resin.
