<ABSTRACT>
Seal for a piston operated by a fluidic medium, containing a supporting body (1) of non-magnetisable material, which at least partly encloses an annular permanent magnet (2) and is connected to at least one sealing lip (3) of elastomeric material, in which arrangement the sealing lip (3) projects on the outside beyond the supporting body (1) in the radial direction and can be brought into sealing engagement with the inner wall (4) of a housing (6) surrounding the piston (5). The supporting body (1) is of one-piece design and is connected to the permanent magnet (2).

<CLAIMS>
A piston (5) with a seal driven by a fluid
medium, comprising a supporting body (1) made of

nonmagnetizable material, which at least partially
surrounds an annular permanent magnet (2) arranged on

that side of the supporting body (1) which faces the
housing (6) and is connected to at least one sealing lip

(3) made of elastomeric material, the sealing lip (3)
projecting radially beyond the supporting body (1) at

the outside and being capable of being brought into
sealing engagement with the inner wall (4) of a housing

which surrounds the piston, the supporting body (1)
being of a one-piece design and being connected to the

permanent magnet (2), and a guide ring (7) being
arranged between the axially adjacent sealing lips (3.1,

3.2), the said guide ring being capable of being brought
in a sliding manner into engagement with the housing (6)

characterized in that the supporting body (1) completely
surrounds the permanent magnet (2) and in that the guide

ring (7) and the supporting body (1) are of a one-piece
design.
A piston according to claim 1, characterized in
that the supporting body (1) is connected to sealing

lips (3.1, 3.2) at an axial distance from one another
and in that the sealing lips (3.1, 3.2) are designed so

as to merge integrally into one another and are in each
case arranged in the region of an end boundary of the

supporting body (1).
A piston according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that supporting body (1) and the guide ring 

(7) are composed of PTFE.
