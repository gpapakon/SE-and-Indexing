<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to 
a sclera plug consisting of a lactocopolymer, 

a sclera plug containing 
a drug and designed so as 

to release the drug gradually into 
a vitreous body, and a sclera plug 

used to cure or prevent a retinal 
disease by utilizing the sustained 

release action of the drug 
and promote the healing of a vitreous 

body after a surgical operation 
thereon. The sclera plug 

according to the present invention 
closes effectively an opening 

made during a surgical operation 
on a vitreous body, and need 

not be removed after the surgical 
operation. When this sclera 

plug is used, a drug can be released 
gradually for a long period 

of time into intraocular tissues 
into which the permeating of 

a drug is otherwise very difficult, 
so that the administration of a 

drug can be carried out safely and 
effectively. Moreover, a simple 

clinically applicable administration 
method can be found by utilizing 

a sclera cut made during a 
surgical operation on a vitreous 

body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biodegradable medical
device to deliver a medication to a specific internal site,
which is made of lactic acid polymer and contains a
drug. Moreover, the present invention relates to a medical
device that can be used to treat or prevent diseases
of the retina or to promote a recovery from damage after
vitreous surgery while taking advantage of the sustained
release of a drug.A vitreous body is one of intraocular tissues that is
viscous, transparent, and gel-like. A vitreous body consists
mainly of water and includes components comprising collagen
fibers and hyaluronic acid. The retina is the most inner
tissue layer of the eye. It covers a vitreous body and is in
direct contact therewith. Diseases of the retina are generally
intractable and some of the diseases are accompanied by opacity
of the vitreous body. Examples of such diseases are retinal
hemorrhage caused by various damage, proliferative 
vitreoretinopathy accompanied by vascularization and
proliferation of retinal cells, retinal detachment and
retinoblastoma.Eye diseases are generally treated by instillation of
drugs. However, drugs can barely reach the retina or vitreous
body by instillation. Moreover, the blood-aqueous barrier
reduces delivery of effective concentration of a drug to the
retina or a vitreous body even by a systemic administration,
e.g., intravenous administration. It is not practical to
inject a drug directly into a vitreous body, because injection
of a high concentration of a drug may cause disorders of
intraocular tissues and the procedure for repeated injection
is laborious and may cause infection.Some diseases are treated by intraocular surgery. For
example, in the case of vitreous hemorrhage, the opaque
vitreous body is excised, and in the case of proliferative
vitreoretinopathy, the proliferative tissues and the vitreous
body are excised. In the case of retinal detachment, the
vitreous body is excised and an artificial vitreous body such
as silicone is used to hold the retina steady. In vitreous
surgery, the sclera that is the eyeball wall is incised at
three sites; a site to irrigate physiological irrigating
solution into the eye, a site to insert a guide that is used 
to light up the intraocular portion, and a site to insert tools
for excision of a vitreous body, such as a cutter. A scleral
plug made of metal may be used temporarily to insert tools into
the eye or remove them (Am. J. Ophthalmol. 91, 797 (1981)), but
the incisions are finally sutured to complete surgery.For medicinal

Biodegradable medical device to deliver a medication
into a vitrous body, which is made of lactic

acid polymer and contains a drug, characterized in
that the device is a nail-like scleral plug and has a

head portion (1, 11) and a shaft portion (3, 13),
wherein only the shaft portion (3, 13) of the scleral

plug is insertable into the vitreous body through the
sclera such that the head portion (1, 11) remains

outside the vitreous body, whereby the shaft portion
(3, 13) is absorbable into the vitreous body so that

the drug is released gradually into the vitreous body
