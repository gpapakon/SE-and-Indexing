<ABSTRACT>
At the time of starting movement as well as at the time 
when a crawler type tractor, e.g., a bulldozer for 

performing a dosing operation and a ripping operation is 
held in a three-point grounding state, an output from an 

engine (10) is automatically reduced further from a normal 
cut-off state, whereby an operator is not required to 

depress a deceleration pedal (13). Consequently, a burden 
to be borne by him can be reduced substantially.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a crawler 
type tractor, e.g., a bulldozer having a blade, a ripper or 
the like attached thereto to perform a dosing operation, a 
ripping operation or the like. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to an apparatus for controlling an 
output from an engine installed on the crawler type tractor 
wherein the engine output is automatically controlled in an 
optimum manner based on a shoe slip at the time of starting 
movement of the vehicle (crawler type track), at the time 
when the vehicle is held in a neutral state or at the time 
when the vehicle is held in a three-point grounding state. Generally, a crawler type tractor, e.g., a bulldozer or 
the like vehicle runs such that an output from an engine 
installed on the vehicle is transmitted to sprockets via a 
power line comprising a torque converter, a speed changing 
unit, bevel gears, a steering clutch, a steering brake and a 
final speed reduction unit and thereby track shoes extending  
 
round the sprocket wheels are driven. On the other hand, a target engine speed of the engine 
on the crawler type tractor is set to a predetermined value 
by a throttle lever. Once the target engine speed is set, 
an output torque generated by the engine is controlled to 
reach the target engine speed by controlling a quantity of 
fuel to be injected. Usually, the crawler type tractor is 
equipped with a deceleration pedal so that the engine output 
can be reduced to a value corresponding to an extent of 
depressing of the deceleration pedal which has been 
depressed by an operator. Tractive power generated by the engine during running 
of the crawler type tractor is related to a shoe slip rate 
representative of shoe slip appearing between the track 
shoes and the ground surface. As the shoe slip increases, 
the tractive power increases correspondingly, until the shoe 
slip rate reaches a predetermined limit value. However, if 
the shoe slip rate exceeds the predetermined limit value, 
the track shoes are uselessly caused to slip with the result 
that an engine output from the engine on the crawler type 
tractor fails to be effectively utilized as a tractive 
power. This leads to not only loss of energy but also wear 
of the track shows within a short period of time. Hitherto, e.g., when shoe slip occurs due to increased 
load during a soil heaping operation with the use of a blade  
 
or during a ripping operation with the use of a ripper unit 
attached to the bulldozer, an operator senses an occurrence 
of

comprises; 
   tractive power characteristics outputting means for

   amplitude detecting means for deriving an amplitude of 

the accelerated vibration based on said detected 
acceleration per each period of the vibration, 

   comparing means for comparing said amplitude of the 
accelerated vibration derived by said amplitude detecting
