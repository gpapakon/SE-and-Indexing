<ABSTRACT>
A filtration medium (10) especially useful in cross-flow type filtration systems comprising a length of porous strong substrate (12), preferably woven, and a thin porous membrane (22), such membrane (22) being bonded to the strands of the substrate (12) by islands of resin (18) uniformly spaced apart and disposed generally between the substrate (12) and the membrane (22). The islands of resin (18) enhance the integrity of the composite during its use in a filtration system. A method and apparatus for the manufacture of the filtration medium (10) is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FILTRATION MEDIUM INCLUDING SUBSTRATE-SUPPORTEDPOROUS MEMBRANE ANDMETHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOFThis invention relates to filtration media and particularly to filtration media that are useful in cross- flow type filtration systems.Cross-flow filtration systems require that the liquid-solid mixture ("slurry") be flowed over the surface of a filtration medium at a rate at which the solids of the slurry are swept along with the flowing slurry and not allowed to contact the surface of the filtration medium for a time period sufficient to permit their accumulation on the medium. These systems require that the slurry be pressurized (hence contained in a closed system) to the extent that the required flow (i.e., velocity) of the slurry can be maintained and that the liquid can be forced to preferentially flow from the slurry and out of the closed system to thereby reduce the liquid content of the slurry. In these systems, there is never any accumulation of the solids in the form of a filter cake as is coramonly thought of in filtration systems. But rather, these systems serve only to concentrate the solids within the slurry. The limit of liquid removal, hence the solids content of the slurry, is in large part dictated by the ability of the system to pump the slurry as it thickens due to increasing solids concentration as the slurry is recycled through the system. Maximum solids concentrations of about 25% are common - solids concentrations of the slurry of greater than about 50% are rare, if at all obtainable, due to the availability of acceptable filtration media which can withstand the high pressures required in pumping of the concentrated slurry for maintaining the necessary flow velocity of the slurry.Tubular filtration media have been recommended for use in cross-flow filtration systems. These media include an inner porous liner which has tortuous passageways through its thickness. This liner is backed by a spongy porous middle layer and an outer non-porous strength layer. Fine solid particles which pass through 

 the inner layer can become captured in the spongy middle layer from which they normally cannot be removed so that these media tend to have short service lives. Further, the innermost surface of the liner of these tend to collect solid particles from the liquid/solid slurry being processed. These particles clog the pores of the liner so that steps must be taken to routinely and periodically perform a cleaning operation on the inner liner surface.It is an object of the present invention to

CLAIMS
1. A filtration medium comprising a porous substantially planar substrate means having first and second substantially planar opposite surfaces defined by the cumulative effect of spaced apart portions and which provides support to the medium and further defines a plurality of open passageways between said opposite surfaces to define the gross filtration capacity of the medium, a thin porous membrane overlaid on one of said surfaces of said substrate, the pores of which define open passageways through the thickness of said membrane of a size sufficient to permit the passage therethrough of a liquid which is under the influence of a pressure differential across the thickness of said medium, and a plurality of discrete and substantially uniformly spaced- apart islands of thermoplastic resin of substantially uniform size disposed between said one of said surfaces of said substrate and said membrane and maintaining said substrate and said membrane in spaced apart relationship, said resin being bonded at fixed spaced apart locations to said substrate and to said porous membrane to integrate said substrate and said membrane in their spaced apart relationship.
2. The filtration medium of Claim 1 wherein said thermoplastic is chosen from the class consisting of polyamide acrylic, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane and polyester.
3. The filtration medium of Claim 1 wherein said substrate is woven from warp and weft strands and said resin is disposed at the intersections of said warp and weft strands.
4. The filtration medium of Claim 1 wherein said porous membrane includes substantially straight-bore pores through the thickness thereof.
5. The filtration medium of Claim 1 wherein each of said islands of resin is formed from a single resin particulate.
6. The filtration medium of Claim 5 wherein 


each of said single resin particulates is between about 200 and about 500 micrometers in diameter.
7. The filtration medium of Claim 1 wherein the particle diameter of each of said resin particulates is greater than the diametral dimension of the interstice between adjacent strands of said substrate, but sufficiently small as to not deleteriously affect the permeability of either said membrane or said substrate upon the heating of said resin particulates to their glass transition temperature and subsequently cooling said resin to solidify the same.
8. A method for the formation of a filtration medium capable of providing at least one generally planar filtration surface comprising the steps of
selecting a strong planar substrate having first and second substantially planar opposite surfaces and having defined through the thickness thereof a plurality of open substantially straight bore passageways which extend between said opposite surfaces;
depositing a quantity of discrete thermoplastic resin particulates onto one of said surfaces of said substrate, said particulates being of a size not less than about the mesh size of said substrate;
thereafter overlaying a thin porous membrane onto said resin particulate- bearing surface of said substrate, said membrane defining through the thickness thereof a plurality of open pores each of which is of a size which permits the flow of a liquid therethrough under the influence of a differential pressure 


 across said medium;
thereafter heating said substrate- resin-membrane composite to at least the glass transition temperature of said resin whereupon said resin becomes sufficiently fluid to flow;
thereafter cooling said substrate- resin-membrane composite to a temperature below the glass transition temperature of said resin whereupon said resin particulates become bonded at fixed spaced-apart locations to said substrate and to said membrane and remain disposed between said substrate and said membrane to thereby maintain said substrate and said membrane in spaced-apart relationship.
9. The method of Claim 8 wherein said composite is heated by means of heat applied to that surface of said substrate opposite the surface which carries said resin and membrane.
