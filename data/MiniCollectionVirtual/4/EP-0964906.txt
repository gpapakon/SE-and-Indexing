<DESCRIPTION>
 Fabric Treatment CompositionsTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to fabric washing detergent compositions. In particular, the invention relates to fabric washing detergent compositions containing photofading inhibitors .Background and prior artThe fading of coloured fabrics by sunlight during wear and during drying is a major problem for consumers in many parts of the world, thus susceptible fabrics in temperate and high latitude regions in addition to those in the tropics can be severely faded. Sun fading of fabrics is of specific concern to consumers because the contrast between exposed and unexposed areas makes it particularly noticeable, e.g on collars, inside versus outside of garments, and on wrap around garments such as saris. The textile industry has made extensive efforts to develop light stable dyes and after treatments to protect the dyes, however the fading of fabric still remains a problem.The use of certain sunscreens has already been discussed in the literature. US 4 788 054 (Bernhardt) teaches the use of N-phenylphthalisomides as ultraviolet radiation absorbers for cotton, wool, polyester and rayon. The compositions require an aqueous sulphuric acid vehicle for deposition. Fabric care compositions comprising a water dispersible / water soluble copolymers which prevent photofading are disclosed in EP 0 523 956 (Unilever) .GB 1 387 520 (L'Oreal) discloses formulations that contain derivative of benzylidene-camphor in cosmetic formulations. 

However the major problem that needs to be overcome is how to deposit photofading inhibitors onto fabric during the wash using a detergent containing washing system, which is designed to suspend particulate materials and solubilise oils. This problem is particularly exacerbated by the presence of anionic surfactant.The present invention relates to compositions in which selected photofading inhibitors deposit easily onto fabric during the wash process.Definition of the InventionAccordingly the present invention discloses a detergent composition comprising an anionic surfactant and a cationic UV absorber having the general formula:Formula Iin which R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms and Y represents a halogen atom, a methyl group or a hydrogen atom and X~ any suitable counter ion. 

The invention further discloses the use of a cationic sunscreen as described above in a fabric treatment composition such that when said fabric treatment composition is applied to fabric the cationic sunscreen prevents

Claims
1) A detergent composition comprising an anionic surfactant and a cationic UV absorber having the general formula :
in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms and Y represents a halogen atom, a methyl group or a hydrogen atom and X
"
 represents any suitable counter-ion.
A detergent composition according to claim 1 in which the cationic UV absorber has the formula:

 in which X represents an alkyl sulphate, alkyl alkyl sulphate, an alkyl aryl sulphonate or an halide.
3) A detergent composition according to claim 2 in which X
~
 of the cationic UV absorber represents methyl sulphate.
4) A detergent composition according to any preceding claim in which the level of cationic sunscreen is from
0.01% to 10% by weight of the total formulation.
5) A detergent composition according to any preceding claim that further comprises nonionic surfactant.
6) A detergent composition according to any preceding claim that further comprises a detergent builder.
7) Use of a cationic sunscreen as described in any preceding claim in a fabric treatment composition such that when said fabric treatment composition is applied to fabric the cationic sunscreen prevents photofading of said fabric.
8) A method of preventing the photofading of fabric by treating the fabric with a composition containing a cationic sunscreen as described above.
9) Use of a cationic sunscreen as described in any preceding claim in a fabric treatment composition such that when said fabric treatment composition is applied to the fabric, the cationic sunscreen increases the UPF of said fabric, thus protecting underlying skin from UV rays . 


10) A method of protecting skin from UV rays by treating fabric with a composition containing a cationic sunscreen as described above so that skin covered by said fabric is protected from UV rays.
