<ABSTRACT>
This is a hydraulic anti-vibration device comprising, between its two chambers, two passages (8, 10) mounted in parallel and a rotary stopper (11) taking as its axis that (X) of the device and capable of shutting off or freeing, at will, on the one hand at least one of the two passages and, on the other hand, ports causing the chambers to communicate with a disconnection valve. The angular displacements of the stopper are controlled by the successive energisations of two small antagonistic electromagnets (14, 15) housed in the outer portion of the intermediate partition (7) and capable of attracting a ferromagnetic armature (16) of the stopper, which armature is itself returned to a middle position by a small spring (17).

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic antivibration device comprising a rigid 
strength member (1) that is annular about an axis X, a rigid 

stud (3) coaxial with said strength member, an annular 
elastomer wall (5) about the axis X and capable of withstanding 

axial compression interposed between the strength 
member and the stud, a flexible and liquid-tight bellows (6) 

carried by the strength member and co-operating with the 
strength member, the stud, and the annular wall to define an 

enclosure, a rigid intermediate partition (7) carried by the 
strength member and subdividing the inside of the enclosure 

into two chambers, a working chamber (A) adjacent to the 
wall, and a compensation chamber (B) adjacent to the 

bellows, two passages (8 and 10) having different sections 
and putting the two chambers into communication with each 

other, a mass of liquid filling the two chambers and the 
passages, a shutter (11) that is rotary about the axis X and 

that is suitable for opening or closing at will at least the 
passage (10) of larger section, a tab of ferromagnetic 

material (16, 31, 34) that forms a portion of the rotary 
shutter and that is eccentric relative to the axis X, 

electromagnetic means housed in the periphery of the rigid 
intermediate partition (7) and disposed to act angularly on 

the tab in one direction about the axis X, resilient means 
(17) urging said tab angularly in the opposite direction, 

and slots (19) formed through the rotary shutter and 
suitable for co-operating with slots (20, 21) formed through 

the intermediate partition in such a manner as to put both 
chambers into communication with a decoupling valve member 

(22) centered on the axis X and mounted to move within the 
intermediate partition, the antivibration device being 

characterized in that the electromagnetic means comprise two 
small electromagnets (14, 26 ; 15, 27) eccentric relative to 

the axis X, and two magnetic circuits that are looped by the 
tab (16, 31, 34) via two respective gaps (e1, e2) disposed 

angularly on either side  
 

of said tab, in that the resilient means (17) are 
disposed to urge the tab constantly towards a middle 

angular position in which the widths of the two gaps are 
equal, and in that the slots (19) formed through the 

shutter are disposed in such a manner that the above 
communication with the decoupling valve member (22) is 

established while the larger section constricted passage 
is closed, and, on the contrary, is interrupted when said 

passage is opened. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the annular wall (5) is generally frustoconical in 

appearance. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the two electromagnets (26, 27) are angularly 

juxtaposed one against the other with an interposed plate 
of ferromagnetic material (28), and in that the end of 

each electromagnet furthest from the other electromagnet 
is juxtaposed with a respective end plate of ferromagnetic 

material (28, 29) that overhangs slightly in 
such a manner that the assembly comprising the electromagnets 

and the plates forms a U-shape encompassing the 
tab (31, 34), the gaps being located between said tab and 

the legs of the U-shape as embodied by the overhanging 
portions (32, 33) of the end plates. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the rotary shutter (11) is a disk that is extended at its 

periphery by a cylindrical rim including at least one 
shutter member (12, 121) suitable for moving past the 

opening (13) of one of the constricted passages (8, 10) 
hollowed out in the periphery of the intermediate 

partition (7), and in that the tab of ferromagnetic 
material is constituted by a cylindrically arcuate 

portion (31) fitted to the edge of the disk.  
 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the rotary shutter is a disk (35) having at least one 

slot formed therein suitable for passing over the opening 
of one of the constricted passages, and in that the tab 

of ferromagnetic material is a flat radial extension (34) 
of said disk and in the form of a circular section. 
A device according to any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the angular extent of the tab (31, 

34) lies in the range 60° to 90°. 
A device according to any preceding claim,
 
characterized in that the set of electromagnetic means is 

located between two circular cylinders about the axis X 
having respective diameters lying in the range 40 mm to 

80 mm and in the range 80 mm to 120 mm. 
A device according to any preceding claim,
 
characterized in that the coils of the two electromagnets 

(14, 26; 15, 27) are connected in series with respective 
rectifiers (36, 37) and in that they are fed with 

electricity from a DC source (39) via a double reversing 
switch (38).
