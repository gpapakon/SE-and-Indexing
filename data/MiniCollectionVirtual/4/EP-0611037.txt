<ABSTRACT>
A layered product and a process for its manufacture is disclosed, the 
layered product comprising a porous substrate (9), a barrier layer (10) 

and a 
release layer (11) so situated such that the barrier layer is between the 

porous substrate and the release layer. A layered product according 
to the invention is suitable for wound coverings, protective clothing, 

diapers, food packaging, roofing underliners and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making layered products 
demonstrating moisture vapor permeability, while acting as barriers 
to liquids and microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria. Such 
layered products have various end-uses including as wound 
coverings, protective clothing, diapers, personal hygiene products, 
food packaging, the construction industry, e.g. roofing underliners 
and the like. Various difficulties are encountered in manufacturing such layered 
products due to the fact that certain layers must be made sufficiently 
thin to provide the layered product with a satisfactory moisture 
vapor transmission rate (MVTR). These layers are often difficult to 
produce and subsequently handle, as they often have a tendency to 
adhere to unintended surfaces, e.g. various surfaces of the 
manufacturing equipment with which they contact. Various processes are known for overcoming this problem. German 
patent application publication DE 40 16 348 A1 discloses a method 
for extruding thin layers onto substrates in which suction is applied 
under the substrate opposite the extruded layer to apparently 
partially draw the layer into substrate to better adhere the layer to 
the substrate and to form a thinner layer than would be achieved 
without the use of suction. European Patent Specification EP 0 295 694 B1 discloses a process for 
extruding a thin layer onto a substrate which employs a 
thermoplastic resin having a particularly high melt viscosity at the 
conditions of the extrusion. In one embodiment, the thin layer may 
be coextruded with a second, peelable layer, the second, peelable 
layer serving to provide support for the thin layer during the 
extrusion operation and subsequently being peeled away. It is an object of the present invention to provide a layered product 
comprising a porous substrate, a barrier layer, a release layer and 
optional other layers as described hereinafter, the barrier layer 
being sufficiently thin to provide the requisite MVTR, while acting as  
 
a barrier to liquids and microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria. 
The layered product is made according to the invention by way of an 
extrusion process wherein a barrier layer and release layer (and 
optional other layers) are coextrusion coated onto a porous substrate. 
The release layer enables an improved adhesion of the barrier layer 
to the porous substrate by preventing the barrier layer from 
adhering to unintended surfaces, e.g. the chill roll or the nip roll of 
the manufacturing equipment, as

substrate and other regions of the barrier layer do not 
adhere to the porous substrate. 
A layered product according to any one of claims 1 to 
7 further comprising a tie layer situated between the 

barrier layer and the porous substrate. 
A layered product according to claim 8 wherein regions 
of the tie layer adhere to porous substrate and other 

regions of the tie layer do not adhere to the porous 
substrate. 
A layered product according to claims 8 or 9 wherein the tie 
layer comprises an ethylene copolymer or a polyurethane. 
A process for making a layered product comprising coextrusion 
coating onto a porous substrate a barrier layer and a release layer so 

situated such that the barrier layer is between the release layer and 
the porous substrate.

comprises a paper, a woven or non-woven fabric or a porous or 

perforated film, the barrier layer comprises a thermoplastic resin 
selected from the group consisting of copolyether amides, 

copolyether esters and polyurethanes and the release layer 
comprises an ethylene copolymer, a low molecular weight wax or a 

second porous substrate. 
A process according to claim 11 or 12 further comprising 
coextrusion coating a tie layer situated between the porous substrate 

and the barrier layer.
