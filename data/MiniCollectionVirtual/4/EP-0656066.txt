<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for assessing the contamination status of materials with respect to possible presence of microorganisms, particularly pathogenic microorganisms, by measuring the production of a specific gas or vapour evolved by a sample of the material when it is incubated with a bacterial enzyme substrate. More particularly the present invention relates to the selective detection of (Escherichia coli) organisms in the material sample and relating the presence and/or number of these to the presence and/or number of pathogenic organisms. The method is particularly applicable to testing foodstuffs for the likely presence of pathogens. Most preferred substrates comprise o-nitrophenyl-(beta)-D-glucuronidde and methylsalicyly-(beta)-D-glucuronide. Test kits for carrying out said method are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DETECTION OF MICROORGANISMS USING GAS SENSORS.The present invention relates to a method of assessing the contamination status of materials with respect to possible presence of microorganisms, particularly pathogenic microorganisms, by measuring the production of a specific gas or vapour evolved by a sample of the material when it is incubated with a bacterial enzyme substrate. More particularly the present invention relates to the selective detection of Eschericia coli (E. coli) organisms in the material sample and relating the presence and/or number of these to the presence and/or number of pathogenic organisms. The method is particularly applicable to testing foodstuffs for the likely presence of pathogens.It is known to assess the bacteriological safety of foods by assessing the number of E.coli present and using that as an indication of the likely presence of pathogens. However, conventional methods are both time consuming and inaccurate (eg. see Ogden and Watt (199D Letters in Applied Microbiology, 13. 212-215), and there is a general need for more rapid and more automated methods.It is known to detect isolated E.coli by measuring the evolution of o-nitrophenol (ONP) from pure cultures to which o-nitrophenyl -β-D-galactoside (ONPG) has been added (Snyder et al. Anal. Chem. 1991. 63, 5 6-529). The endogenous β-galactoside enzyme in the E. coli is first stimulated by growing the culture overnight in a lactose medium, amounts of organism containing suspension are placed on filter disks with an equal volume of ONPG (2 mg/ml) and placed in sealed test tubes before incubating at 40 to 42°C. On sampling the seals are removed and the headspace vapour is analysed by use of an ion-mobility detector device of the type described in GB patents 1,274,634, 1,306,534 and 2,052,750.While this technique is useful for determination of quantities of E.coli in some applications, use of the β-galactosidase enzyme is not 

an option when monitoring pathogenic bacteria in foodstuffs as it is found in many harmless bacteria commonly associated with foodstuff manufacture and storage. A more specific method for detection and enumeration of E. coli in foodstuffs is required.The present inventors have now provided a method for the identification, detection and/or enumeration of organisms of species E. coli. which is specific enough to be used upon samples derived from foodstuffs such that false positive results are not obtained where only organisms associated with consumable food are present.The selected method is such that
