<CLAIMS>
A shut-off device for gaseous media at high temperature, in 
particular for shutting off the hot gas conduits which lead from blast 

air heaters to a blast furnace, comprising a housing (1) with sealing 
seats (2, 3) cooled by a coolant and a shut-off member (4) arranged 

movably in the housing (1) and cooled by a coolant, wherein with the 
exception of the housing sealing seats (2, 3) and the sealing surfaces 

(6, 7) on the shut-off member (4) all surfaces which come into contact 
with the hot gas are provided with a refractory coating (15, 16), 

characterised in that at least all uncooled surfaces of the shut-off 
device, which come into contact with the hot gas, are provided with an 

additional insulation (17) which has a high thermal insulation action and 
which is disposed between the refractory coating (15, 16) and the metal 

structure. 
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
additional insulation (17) which has a high thermal insulation action 

comprises thin mineral fibre mats. 
A shut-off device according to claims 1 and 2 wherein the shut-off 
member (4) is in the form of a linearly displaceable slider plate and 

the housing (1) is provided with a hood (10) having a refractory lining 
and into which the slider plate can be slid in the open position 

characterised in that the hood (10) is also provided with the additional 
insulation (17) which has a high thermal insulation action between the 

refractory coating (16) and the metal structure. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the cooled surfaces of the shut-off member (4), which come into 

contact with the hot gas, are also at least partially provided with an 
additional insulation (17) which has a high thermal insulation action.  

 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the surfaces which lie directly in the hot gas flow are clad with 

dense refractory concrete (15). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the surfaces which do not lie in the hot gas flow are internally 

clad with refractory lightweight concrete (16).
