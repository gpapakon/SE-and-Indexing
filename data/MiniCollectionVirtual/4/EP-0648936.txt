<ABSTRACT>
A motor pump group has a plurality of centrifugal 
pumps of the same nominal port diameter including a plurality 

of impellers having stepwise greater outside diameters for 
stepwise higher pump heads, and a plurality of respective 

motors for actuating the pumps. The pump heads are 
classified into a low head section and a high head section. 

The low head section is handled by a single-stage impeller, 
and the high head section is handled by multi-stage 

impellers. The centrifugal pumps have respective pressed-sheet 
pump casings. The outside diameters of the impellers 

are not required to be increased in the high head section, 
and the outside diameters of the pump casings fall in a 

relatively small range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor pump group
and a method of manufacturing such a motor pump group, and more
particularly to a motor pump group comprising a plurality of
pressed-sheet pumps of the same nominal port diameter having a
series of impellers of stepwise greater outside diameters for
stepwise higher pump heads, and a motor for actuating the
pumps, and a method of manufacturing such a motor pump group.There have heretofore been available international
standards (ISO) defining major dimensions and nominal
particulars of single-suction centrifugal pumps. Table 1,
below, shows some of the international standards relative to
the single-suction centrifugal pumps.

ratio of the nominal dimensions of the suction port and the
nominal ratio of the outside diameters of the impeller is set
to 1.25 or a similar value. The nominal ratio of pump heads 
is set to (1.25)2 = 1.6 or a similar value, and the nominal
ratio of flow rates is set to 2.DE-A-1 063 033 discloses that in the field of manufacturing
centrifugal pumps, it is known to manufacture
the most important parts of single stage pumps in
standardized production runs for reasons of economic
production, i. e., the outer diameters of the impellers
and the port diameters are staggered according to
standardized numbers with respect to the head and the
amount of pumped medium such that each some types of the
series provide for different heads for about the same
amount of medium and the same port diameter,
respectively.Further it is said that experience has shown that for the
division of the head and the amount of pumped medium of a
power field according to standardized numbers, the
standardized series of ten with the step or jump of ten,

is most favorable, inasmuch as a step or jump of the
diameter of approximately 1.26 is best suited to agree
with the requirement for a small pump number and for a
small decrease of efficiency.The impeller outer diameter ratio of about 1.26 for
sequential heads in a standardized series of single stage
pumps, as described in the above mentioned
