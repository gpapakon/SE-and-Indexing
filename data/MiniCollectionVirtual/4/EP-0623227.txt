<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal lens drive circuit for a pair of spectacles has user-controllable components (14, 21) which can be used to adjust the response time of the circuit to changes in ambient light and adjust the particular response of the circuit to excess light above a threshold in accordance with a desired response characteristic. Thus, momentary changes in the light level from the general ambient can be prevented from changing the optical density of the lenses unnecessarily and individual preferences as to the darkening characteristic can be accommodated in a standard pair of spectacles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to variable
optical density lenses and in particular to lenses in which
the optical density is controlled as a settable function of
ambient light intensity.Optical devices using liquid crystal lenses are known
from, for example, US-A-4 021 935, US-RE-29 684,
US-A-4 190 330 and US-A-4 106 217. A type of variable
optical density spectacle lens which responds to changes in
ambient light is described in US-A-4 279 474. The
arrangement described therein uses a liquid crystal means
sandwiched between a pair of matching curved glass lenses.
This system gives a response time which is much faster than
that of photochromic lenses. The rapid response of the
liquid crystal lens overcomes the drawbacks of prior
photochromic lens. The variation in optical density is
achieved by driving the spectacle lens with an electrical
signal of suitable waveform.However, the response time of the liquid crystal
lenses as described in US-A-4 279 474 and other prior art
is unlikely to represent the optimum for all users under
all conditions. The actual response time of the lens will
be determined by whichever of the response time of the
liquid crystal or the time for the driving waveform to
change is longer.US-A-5 015 086 discloses an electrical circuit for a
liquid crystal lens, having a capacitor for delaying the
timing of switching transmittance in response to changes in
ambient light levels and the present invention is
characterised over this document.It is particularly important to achieve a satisfactory
response time even in situations where, for example, the
light falling on the photodetector is momentarily reduced
and, with a short response time, the lenses would otherwise
become maximally transmissive (optical density at a
minimum), even though the general ambient level remains 
high. Practical cases of this are when driving on a sunny
day through shadows cast by railings or a row of trees. At
the same time, it is important still to provide for a fast
response to changes in the ambient light level such as
occur when a vehicle enters a tunnel or when the wearer of
spectacles looks suddenly in the sun's direction. Both
requirements should be met for a commercially attractive
product.According to the present invention, there is provided
an electrical circuit arranged to control the optical density
of a liquid crystal lens in dependence upon ambient light
levels measured by a light detector, in order to adjust the
amount of light transmitted through the lens, characterised
in that the
