<ABSTRACT>
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, and other pharmaceutically active compounds, are formulated with bile acids or their salts and conjugates. Bile acids previously proposed for use in such formulations have placed an unacceptable toxic load on the liver and/or cells of the gastrointestinal tract, causing abnormal liver function or cell erosion. In this invention, the bile acid is a low detergent bile acid, such as ursodeoxycholate. Stabilization of the bile acid pool results in enhanced and predictable enterohepatic recycling of NSAIDs (and other drugs) and a reduced risk of toxicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions. 
In preferred embodiments, the invention relates to 
pharmaceutical compositions of drugs which undergo 
biliary excretion and/or enterohepatic recycling. The 
invention also relates to a method of formulating a 
pharmaceutically active agent into a pharmaceutical 
composition and to a method of administering drugs, as 
well as to the use of drugs and certain other ingredients 
in the preparation of pharmaceutically useful 
compositions. The invention also provides a means of 
avoiding hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicity due to 
drug administration. It is in general known to formulate surfactants with 
pharmaceutical agents for the purpose of solubilizing 
them as in, for example, EP-A-0179583, WO-A-9012583 and EP-A-0391369. 
EP-A-0274870 teaches that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), which are in general poorly water 
soluble, can be administered, as well as solubilized, as 
micelles and that this has advantages of (a) potentially 
protecting the drug from the acidic and enzymatic 
environment of the stomach and (b) protecting the 
gastrointestinal mucosa from adverse effects of the drug 
(such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which is induced by 
NSAIDs including aspirin, indomethacin and piroxicam). 
Bile acids (or bile salts - the exact nature and 
proportion of the species present will depend on the pH 
of the environment and so the terms are used 
interchangeably in this specification) are naturally 
occurring surfactants. They are a group of compounds 
with a common "backbone" structure based on cholanic acid 
found in all mammals and higher vertebrates. The  
 
detergent properties of bile acids are largely determined 
by the number and orientation of hydroxyl groups 
substituted onto a steroidal nucleus. Bile acids may be 
mono-, di- or tri-hydroxylated; they always contain a 3-α 
hydroxyl group, whereas the other hydroxyl groups, most 
commonly found at C6, C7 or C12, may be positioned above 
(β) or below (α) the plane of the molecule. Many 
permutations of hydroxyl configuration are possible, but 
certain configurations are very much more common in 
nature than others. In most animal species there is a 
recognised pattern to the usual composition of the bile 
acids found in the bile acid pool of individual animals. Bile acids are synthesized in vivo from cholesterol in 
the liver by hydroxylation and other modifications. 
Virtually all bile acids found in the bile of mammals and 
higher vertebrates are amidated at the C24

<CLAIMS>
A pharmaceutical composition adapted for oral 
administration and consisting of a pharmaceutically active 

compound which normally undergoes biliary excretion 
and/or enterohepatic recycling, and a bile acid 

or salt thereof, 
or ursodeoxycholyl N-carboxymethylglycine or an ester thereof 

optionally together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable 
excipients, 

characterised in that the bile 
acid or salt thereof has a low detergent effect, which 

does not lyse human erthrocytes at a concentration of at least 30 mM. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
pharmaceutically active compound is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 

drug (NSAID). 
A composition as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
NSAID is indomethacin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, sulindac, 

tenoxicam or piroxicam. 
A composition as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
NSAID is indomethacin. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the bile acid is optionally amidated 

ursodeoxycholic acid or a salt thereof. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
4, wherein the bile acid is 

norcholic or 
norursocholic acid, β-muricholic acid, 7-ketolithocholate 

or taurodehydrocholate. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
6, which comprises a C
12
-C
24
 fatty acid and wherein a 

portion of the C
12
-C
24
 fatty acid is formulated for non-sustained 
release on non-parenteral administration and 

wherein a portion of the C
12
-C
24
 fatty acid and at least 
a portion of the pharmaceutically active substance are  

 
formulated for sustained release on non-parenteral 

administration. 
A composition as claimed in claim 7, wherein the C
12
-C
24
 
fatty acid is oleic acid. 
A process for the preparation of a composition as 
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, the process 

comprising admixing the ingredients together. 
A process as claimed in claim 9, wherein the 
ingredients are dissolved in a common solvent, the common 

solvent then being evaporated off. 
The use of a pharmaceutically active agent useful in 
a medical condition and which normally undergoes 

substantial biliary excretion and/or enterohepatic 
recycling, and a bile acid or salt thereof, having a low detergent 

effect, 
which does not lyse human erythrocytes at a concentration of at 

least 30 mM, 
in the manufacture of an orally administrable medicament 

for treating, preventing or managing the medical 
condition.
