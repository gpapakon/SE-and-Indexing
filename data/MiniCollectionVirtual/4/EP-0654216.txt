<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a fishing reel which 
prevents fingers against damage even if they accidentally 

touch a loosening preventive member (9) during the winding 
operation of a handle (5), prevents a bait, dust and the 

like from sticking to the loosening preventive member as 
much as possible, and prevents a fishline from getting 

twined around the loosening preventive member (9). The 
handle (5) is threadedly fixed to the end portion of a 

drive shaft (4) by a threaded member (35), and the 
loosening preventive member (9) for preventing the threaded 

member 35 from loosening is fixed to the handle (5). The 
surface of the loosening preventive member (9), which is to 

be mounted to the upper surface (5a) of the handle (5), 
extending from the peripheral edge portion of the member 

(9) to the central portion thereof is formed in a smooth 
surface (9a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fishing reel
in which a handle is threadedly fixed to the end portion of
a drive shaft adapted to drive a spool for taking up or
winding a fishline, by use of a threaded member, as defined
in the preamble clauses of claims 1 and 2.Conventionally, a handle to be mounted to the end
portion of a drive shaft is fastened and fixed by a nut to
which is mounted a loosening preventive member for
preventing the nut from loosening. As examples of such
loosening preventive member for preventing the loosening of
the nut, there are disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Kokai Publication No. Sho. 55-108873 and Japanese Utility
Model Kokai Publication No. Hei. 3-74266 loosening
preventive members which are respectively mounted and fixed
to the handle in such a manner that they project out from
the upper surface of the handle.The loosening preventive members disclosed in the
above-mentioned publications are both so structured as to
project from the upper surface of the handle and,
therefore, fingers may accidentally touch the loosening
preventive member and be damaged during the winding
operation of the handle. Further, the slime of fish, a
bait, dust and the like are easy to stick to the loosening 
preventive member. Furthermore, a fishline may be entwined
or tangled around the loosening preventive member.A fishing reel as mentioned above is known from GB-A-2 261 147 having a handle shaft
secured by a nut covered by a curved loosening preventing member (Fig. 4).In view of the problems found in the conventional
fishing reel, it is an object of the invention to provide
an arrangement for a fishing reel, which prevents fingers
against damage even if they accidentally touch a loosening
preventive member during the winding operation of a handle,
prevents a bait, dust and the like from attaching to the
loosening preventive member as much as possible, and
prevents a fishline from being entwined around the
loosening preventive member so that pleasant fishing can be
realized.Said objective is performed by a fishing reel as defined
in claims 1 and 2. Preferred embodiments are laid down in the further subclaims.Hereinafter, the present invention is explained in greater detail by means of several
embodiments thereof in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a first
embodiment of the invention, in which a dual bearing type
fishing reel is used as a fishing reel;Fig. 2 is a plan view of a handle portion shown
in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is a sectional side view of

<CLAIMS>
Fishing reel comprising a handle fixing structure for fixing a handle (5) onto a drive
shaft (4) of said fishing reel, said structure comprising:


a threaded member (35) for threadingly fixing said handle onto an end of said drive
shaft;
a loosening preventive member mounted onto an upper surface of said handle
for preventing said threaded member from loosening, wherein an outer surface

of said loosening preventive member is formed as a smooth surface extending
from a peripheral edge portion of said loosening preventive member to a

central portion thereof, 
characterised in that
 a recess is formed in said upper
surface of said handle for supporting said loosening preventive member on

said handle.
A handle fixing structure for fixing a handle onto a drive shaft of a fishing reel,
said structure comprising:


a threaded member for threadingly fixing said handle onto an end of said drive
shaft;
a loosening preventive member mounted onto said handle for preventing said
threaded member from loosening,
a cover member mounted on an upper surface of said handle for covering said
loosening preventive member, wherein an outer surface of said cover member

is formed as a smooth surface extending from a peripheral edge portion of said
cover member to a central portion thereof, said cover member being removably

fixed into a recessed portion of the upper surface of the handle.
Fishing reel as set forth in claim 1, wherein said loosening preventive member
is pressure-fitted to said recess. 
Fishing reel as set forth in claims 1 or 2, wherein said loosening preventive
member is fixed to said handle by means of a screw.
Fishing reel as set forth in claims 1 or 2, wherein said loosening preventive
member is fixed to said handle by an elastically deformable securing member.
Fishing reel as set forth in claim 4, wherein said loosening preventive member
is formed with a recess for accommodating said screw so that said screw is

prevented from projecting from said outer surface.
Fishing reel as set forth in claim 6, further comprising: a cover attached to said
recess for covering said screw.
Fishing reel as set forth in clam 7, wherein a surface of said cover is flush with
said outer surface of said loosening preventive member.
Fishing reel as set forth in claim 5, wherein said elastically deformable securing
member is integral with said loosening preventive member.
Fishing reel as set forth in claim 5, wherein said securing member is removable
from said loosening preventive member, and said loosening preventive

member is formed with a recess for receiving said securing member such that

wherein said handle is formed with a curved surface which merges with said

outer surface of said loosening preventive member. 
Fishing reel as set forth in at least one of the preceeding claims 1 to 10,
wherein said upper surface of said handle and said outer surface of said

loosening preventive member co-operatively define a conical and relatively flat
surface.
