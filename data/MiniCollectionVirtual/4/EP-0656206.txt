<ABSTRACT>
An aerosol formulation for oral and/or nasal administration is described. The 
formulation 
comprises 1,1,1,2,3,3,3 heptafluoropropane, a medicament, an excipient 
which is a propylene diester of a C₆-C₁₂ fatty acid or a triglyceride ester of a C₆-C₁₂ 

fatty acid and optionally a surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed at aerosol formulations
which are substantially free of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's). More
specifically, the present invention is directed at formulations
substantially free of CFC's and having particular utility in medicinal
applications, especially in metered dose pressurized inhalators (MDI's).Metered dose inhalators have proven to be an effective
method for delivering medicaments orally and nasally. They have been
used extensively for delivering bronchodilating and steroidal
compounds to asthmatics and may also be useful for delivering other
compounds such as pentamidine and non-bronchodilator anti-inflammatory
drugs. The rapid onset of activity of compounds
administered in this manner and the absence of any significant side
effects have resulted in a large number of compounds being formulated
for administration via this route. Typically, the drug is delivered to the
patient by a propellant system generally comprising one or more
propellants which have the appropriate vapor pressure and which are
suitable for oral or nasal administration. The more preferred propellant
systems typically comprise propellant 11, propellant 12, propellant 114
or mixtures thereof. Often the vapor pressure of the propellant systems
is adjusted by admixing a liquid excipient with the propellant.However, propellants 11, 12 and 114 belong to a class of
compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons, which have been linked to
the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere. It has been postulated that 
ozone blocks certain harmful UV rays and that a decrease in the
atmospheric ozone content will result in an increase in the incidence of
skin cancer. In the 1970's certain steps were taken to reduce the CFC
emissions from aerosols. Other propellants, such as hydrocarbons,
were used, or the product was delivered in a different manner. Because
CFC usage in medicinal applications is relatively low i.e. less than 1% of
total CFC emissions, and because of the health benefits associated with
metered dose inhalators, steps were not taken at that time to restrict the
use of CFC propellants in metered dose inhalators.However, continuing and more sophisticated ozone
measurements have indicated that the earlier restrictions in CFC usage
were insufficient and that additional, significant steps should be taken to
drastically reduce CFC emissions. Recently, recommendations have
been made that CFC production be virtually discontinued by the end of
this century. As a result, it may not be possible to continue to use CFC
propel
