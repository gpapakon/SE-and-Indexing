<ABSTRACT>
A water-based autoxidisable coating composition for 
application to architectural surfaces, fittings or 

furnishings at ambient temperatures which contains water, 
a drier to promote autoxidation and a water-soluble 

autoxidisable film-forming copolymer which contains 0.5 to 
7 wt% of acrylic acid, 50 to 50 wt% of either a hydroxy 

acrylate chosen from hydroxy ethyl or hydroxyisopropyl 
acrylate or alternatively a polyethoxylate (meth)acrylate 

and 30 to 50 wt% of an autoxidisable ester of copolymerised 
acrylic acid in which the esterifying moieties are 3-allyloxy-2-hydroxypropyl 

or the methallyl analogue. Also 
an autoxidisable copolymer of the above composition. The 

coating composition laps well yet is water-soluble and 
resistant to both long term and short term damage by water. 

Also the copolymer for use in the compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water-based autoxidisable
air-drying coating composition, especially a gloss
(including partial gloss) coating composition suitable for
application to architectural surfaces, fittings or
furnishings at ambient temperatures which composition
contains water, a drier which promotes autoxidisation and
a water-soluble autoxidisable film-forming addition
copolymer containing copolymerised acrylic acid,
copolymerised acrylate and/or methacrylate and 3-allyloxy-2-hydroxypropyl
and/or its 1-butenyl analogue. The
invention further relates to water-soluble autoxidisable
film-forming addition copolymer of acrylic acid partially
esterified by 3-allyloxy-2-hydroxypropyl moieties or their
1-butenyl analogue which copolymer is suitable for use in
these coating compositions.Water-based compositions are more environmentally
acceptable than those based on organic solvents and
nowadays even small amounts of organic cosolvent in an
otherwise water-based system are unwelcome. The
autoxidisable air-drying coating composition will generally
be a paint, varnish, woodstain or timber preservative
applicable by brush, roller, pad or spray to architectural
surfaces, fittings or furnishings, that is to say surfaces
usually found in buildings or on furniture. Such paints
are sometimes called "decorative trim paints" because they
are often used on such fittings as doors, window frames and 
skirting boards. A good paint for use on such surfaces
should have a variety of standard properties normally
expected of a decorative trim paint. Firstly it should
have good opacity, that is to say it should be able to
accommodate enough pigment to hide marks on the surface.
Secondly it should have good flow so that it can be easily
spread across the surface. Thirdly it should be easily
washable (using water and detergent) from application
tools, particularly from brushes and rollers. To some
extent, this third requirement conflicts with the fourth
which is that the applied paint should dry fast enough to
achieve reasonably early resistance to water, particularly
domestic condensation or spilled water. The fourth
requirement in turn partially conflicts with the fifth
which is that the paint must lap well at ambient
temperature (say 20°C). For gloss paints, good lapping
means that when adjacent and overlapping bands of paint are
applied to a substrate one after another and allowed to
dry, it should be difficult for a casual observer to detect
a boundary between adjacent contiguous bands of dried paint
even when one band
