<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
device for transferring solid articles and more particularly, 
to a device for transferring a large amount of solid 
articles such as pharmaceutical tablets in a short period 
without causing damage to the solid articles. Generally, devices for transferring solid articles 
in production processes include, for example, a rotary 
screw type transfer device for transferring solid articles 
by rotating a screw, a pneumatic conveying type transfer 
device in which solid articles are fed by air blown into a 
pipe or by suction under vacuum and mechanical transfer 
devices such as a bucket type transfer device, a belt type 
transfer device, a shooter type transfer device, etc. In these mechanical transfer devices, external 
force applied to solid articles during their transfer may 
cause damage to surfaces of the solid articles, thereby 
resulting in fracture or chipping of the solid articles in 
some cases. Therefore, in such cases, the mechanical 
transfer devices cannot be used for transferring pharmaceutical 
tablets or the like. Especially, transfer of sugar-coated tablets is 
a final process of production of the tablets. Since the 
final process should maintain a strict quality level, it is 
difficult that these mechanical transfer devices are used 
for transferring the sugar-coated tablets. Therefore, in  
 
many cases, the tablets are put into a transfer container 
so as to be transferred together with the transfer container 
during transfer from a sugar coating process to the 
subsequent printing and inspection process. It is also 
considered that this transfer is automated by using an 
unmanned transfer carrier, etc. However, this automation 
requires complicated apparatuses and thus, cannot be performed 
at low cost. As a result, transfer from the sugar 
coating process to the subsequent printing and inspection 
process is generally performed manually by using a pallet. A shuttle type transfer device shown in Fig. 1 is 
known as an automatic transfer device for transferring 
solid articles A such as tablets without causing damage to 
the solid articles A. In the known shuttle type transfer 
device, front, middle and rear transfer plates 51a, 51b and 
51c are coupled by a flexible shaft 52 so as to constitute 
a shuttle 50 and this shuttle 50 is disposed in a pipe 53. 
An air flow path 58 for transferring the solid articles A 
is provided at one end 54 of the pipe 53. The solid articles A loaded from a loading aperture 
56 at the end 54 of the pipe 53 are
