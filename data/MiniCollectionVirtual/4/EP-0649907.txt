<ABSTRACT>
An enzymatic hydroxylation process for the 
preparation of compounds 
useful as HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors and/or as intermediates in the 

preparation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors uses a 
microorganism or an enzyme derived from, or having 

the structure of an enzyme derived from, said 
microorganism, which is capable of catalyzing the 

hydroxylation process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
enzymatic hydroxylation process for the preparation
of compounds useful as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
and/or as intermediates in the preparation of HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors.The present invention provides a method for
the preparation of a compound of the formula I:

its partially or completely hydrogenated analogs or
a salt thereof, wherein
R is alkyl or aryl;Z is the open chain moiety 

or
   the lactone

; andR2 is hydrogen, alkyl, ammonium, alkyl-ammonium
or alkali metal;
   comprising the step of contacting a compound
of the formula II:

a partially or completely hydrogenated analog or a
salt thereof, wherein R, Z and R2 are as defined
for formula I, with a microorganism, or with an
enzyme derived from, or having the structure of an 
enzyme derived from said microorganism, which is capable of
catalyzing the hydroxylation of said compound of the formula II or salt
thereof to yield said compound of the formula I or salt thereof, and
effecting said hydroxylation;
   where said microorganism is selected from the genera
Amycolata, Saccharopolyspora, Amycolatopsis, Saccharothrix or
Gilbertella, provided that when the compound of formula II is compactin
or R is alkoxyalkyl or alkyl substituted by protected hydroxy, the
microorganism is not Amycolata.The enzymatic hydroxylation process of the
present invention provides an efficient means for
obtaining compounds of the formula I, which may
themselves exhibit HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory
activity, and/or which may be used as intermediates
in the preparation of other HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitors. Reduction or elimination of by-products
may be achieved by employing the
hydroxylation method of the present invention,
which method may also be conducted under mild
reaction conditions. Known from EP-A-0 609 058, which is considered prior art under the
terms of Article 54(3) and (4) EPC, are processes for the enzymatic
hydroxylation of compounds of formula II above where R is alkoxyalkyl
or alkyl substituted by protected hydroxy and where the microorganism
can be Amycolata, Nocardia or Streptomyces. U.S. Patent No.
4,346,227 discloses the enzymatic hydroxylation of compactin using
various microorganisms among which are microorganisms of the genus
Streptomyces. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,537,859 discloses such
process for hydroxylation of compactin using microorganisms of the
genus Nocardia.The method of the present invention is
described further as follows.The terms "enzymatic process" or "enzymatic
method" as used herein
