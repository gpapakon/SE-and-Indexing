<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement pertaining to a vehicle (2), such as a scooter, which comprise an endless drive element, such as a drive band, which functions to move the vehicle over a running surface (3), such as snow-covered ground, wherein the drive element includes within a delimited section (2a) thereof a pattern (6) which will leave a vehicle identifying pattern in the track (4) formed by the drive element in or on the running surface (3). In relation to a first plane (A) allocated to a drive-element supportive surface (2b) a patterned support surface (5b) belonging to said delimited section extends beyond said first plane (A) through a determined distance in a direction towards a second plane (B) which extends tangentially to drive ridges or traction grooves (2e) on said drive element (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION: An Arrangement Pertaining toEngine-Driven VehiclesTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to an arrangement for use with engine-driven vehicles, such as a scooter or the like, said arrangement comprising an engine-driven endless drive element, such as a drive band by means of which the vehicle is moved on a running surface, such as snow-covered ground, wherein the drive element includes a defined, patterned section which as the vehicle moves on said surface leaves an imprint in the running surface which is significant to and identifies the vehicle concerned.BACKGROUND ARTIt is earlier known to provide the drive bands of snow scooters with embossments which as the scooter moves leave an imprint at intervals of about 1.5 m in the track left behind the scooter in the running surface, this imprint or impression disclosing the registration number of the scooter.One such arrangement is the subject of Swedish Design Application 91-2030 and has earlier been published in the magazine "Kuriren" , Monday, the 2nd March 1992, under the heading "Skall han fa slut pa busakningen?" (translation "Will This Succeed in Ending Rough Driv¬ ing?").DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONTECHNICAL PROBLEMSWhen considering the present state of techniques as described above, it will be seen that a technical problem resides in providing conditions with the aid 

of simple means whereby a track left by a snow scooter or similar vehicle in the running surface will include a pattern which clearly identifies the vehicle con¬ cerned, such as its registration number, by providing within a delimited section of the drive element a mirror image of said pattern, and therewith ensure that when the scooter is driven normally on said surface, among other things on snow-covered ground, the identifying pattern will be clearly imprinted in the track irrespective, or essentially irrespective, of the nature of the snow.Another technical problem is one of realizing the significance of adapting the position of a pattern- carrying plate so that the plate will not only leave a pronounced pattern in the track but will also provide a support surface and a ground-gripping surface which corresponds, or essentially corresponds, to the sup¬ port surface and the gripping surfaces that have been removed from the drive band to provide space for the plate.It will also be seen that a technical problem resides in realizing the significance of spacing the aforesaid support surface belonging to said delimited section at a well-adapted distance

CLAIMS
1. An arrangement pertaining to vehicles, such as scooters, which comprise an endless drive element, such as a drive band, which functions to move the vehicle over a running surface, such as snow-covered ground, wherein the drive element includes within a delimited section thereof a pattern which will leave a vehicle identifying pattern in the track formed by the drive element in or on the running surface, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that in relation to a first plane (A) allocated to a drive-element supportive sur¬ face (2b) a patterned support surface (5b) belonging to said delimited section extends beyond said first plane (A) through a determined distance in a direction towards a second plane (B) which extends tangentially to drive ridges or traction grooves (2e) on said drive element (2) .
2. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that said distance is more than 2 mm from said first plane (A) and less than 25 mm.
3. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a r - a c t e r i z e d in that a third plane (C) belonging to the upper surface (6a') of the pattern is intended to extend in or close to the second plane (B).
4. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a r - a c t e r i z e d in that a third plane (C) belonging to the upper surface (6a') of the pattern is intended to extend on one side of the second plane (B) distal from said first plane (A) .
5. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the delimited section is comprised of elastic material and includes a base plate whose one surface (5a) is secured to the drive element (2) and whose opposite surface carries in 


relief a vehicle significant pattern, such as a combi¬ nation of alphabetical letters (6a) and/or numbers (6b).
6. An arrangement according to Claim 5, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that each letter and/or each number in the alphabetical and/or numerical combina¬ tion forming said pattern has a length of between 4 and 15 cm.
7. An arrangement according to Claim 5, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that each letter and/or each number of the pattern has a height (H) above the base plate of 3 to 15 mm, preferably between 3 and 7 mm.
8. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the delimited section is adapted to carry a registration number in three rows and two columns, as seen in the longitudinal direction of the track.
