<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for delivering fuel to vehicles which has a casing (2) and at least one pump hose (5) which is provided with a hose nozzle (4), extends in the home position, when the hose nozzle (4) is suspended in the casing (2), between the hose nozzle (4) and the fastening of the start of the hose in the casing (2) in at least one loop (6a,6b) and which can be pulled out of the casing (2) over most of its length for the refuelling process when the hose nozzle (4) has been removed. In order to create a device in the case of which the user can pull the pump hose (5) out of the casing (2) without the exertion of force and it is ensured that the pump hose (5) is pulled back into the casing (2) when the refuelling process has been completed, the loop (6) of the pump hose (5) is guided via a rod (10) which is arranged in the casing (2) so as to be capable of being moved vertically by means of a drive (12) and can, after the hose nozzle (4) has been suspended, be returned by the drive (12) to the end position for recovery of the pump hose (5) which has been pulled out of the casing (2).

Device for dispensing fuels to vehicles, with a 
housing (2) and at least one fuel hose (5), which is 

provided with a fuel-pump nozzle (4) and which, in the 
starting position, with the fuel-pump nozzle (4) hooked 

into the housing (2), extends in at least one vertical 
loop (6a) between the fuel-pump nozzle (4) and the 

attachment of its starting end in the housing (2) and the 
majority of the length of which can be pulled out of the 

housing (2) for the refuelling operation after the 
removal of the fuel-pump nozzle (4), the loop (6a) of the 

fuel hose (5) being passed over a horizontal rod (10) 

which is arranged in a vertically movable manner in the 
housing (2) and can be returned to the end position by 

means of an activatable drive (12) for the return of the 
fuel hose (5) that has been pulled out of the housing 

(2), once the fuel nozzle (4) has been hooked in, characterized 
in that the horizontal rod (10) is attached to 

at least one flexible tensile element (11), which is 
driven by a motor (12) and by means of which the rod (10) 

can be moved between a position in which it releases the 
loop (6a) and an end position in which it forms the loop 

(6a). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flexible tensile element (11) is designed as an 

endless chain which is passed over two chain wheels. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the flexible tensile element (11) is designed as a 

cable which is passed over a deflection pulley (14) and 
can be wound on to a cable drum (15). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to  
 

3, with a plurality of fuel hoses arranged in the 
housing, in particular for dispensing different fuel 

grades, characterized in that the hoses (6a) of all the 
fuel hoses (5) are passed over a common rod (10). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that freely rotatable pulleys (13) for the loops (6a) of 

the fuel hoses (5) are arranged on the rod (10). 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the rod (10) is connected to the drive (12) by a 

plurality of flexible tensile elements (11). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
6, with a plurality of fuel-pump nozzles respectively 

arranged on opposite sides of the housing, characterized 
in that the fuel hoses (5) on each side are provided with 

their own rod (10) with its own drive (12). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that, to form a second loop (6b) in 

each case, each fuel hose (5) is passed over a hose 
deflection pulley (3) arranged at a fixed location in the 

housing (2). 
Device according to Claim 8, with a plurality of 
fuel hoses, characterized in that all the hose deflection 

pulleys (3) are mounted in a freely rotatable manner in 
the housing (2) on a common, fixed-location spindle (9). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that the process of returning the 

fuel hose or hoses (5) is monitored by means of a switch 
(16) which detects the return of the rod (10) to the 

starting position.
