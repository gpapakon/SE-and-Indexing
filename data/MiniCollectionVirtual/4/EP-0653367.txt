<ABSTRACT>
A document alignment system includes a plurality of drive rolls (42,44) 
operative to drive documents one by one along a feed path, and a plurality of 

alignment rolls (100) spaced apart along the feed path with their axes 
perpendicular to those of the drive rolls (42,44) and operative to move a 

document (124) transversely to the feed path so as to bring a long edge of the 
document(124) into parallel abutting contact with a reference surface (72). 

When the alignment rolls are operative the drive rolls (42) are inoperative and 
out of contact with the document (124). Each alignment roll (100) is arranged to 

cooperate with a spring biased rotatably mounted ball (112) whereby in the 
course of an alignment operation the document (124) is gripped resiliently 

between the alignment rolls (100) and the cooperating balls (112).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a document alignment system.The invention has application, for example, to a depository apparatus
included in an automated teller machine (ATM) of the kind which is arranged to
carry out a financial transaction, such as dispensing currency notes or accepting
a deposit in the form of an envelope or a single sheet financial document such as
a cheque or payment slip. As is well known, in operation of an ATM of this
kind, a user inserts a customer identification card into the machine and then
enters certain data (such as a personal identification number, type of transaction,
etc.) on one or more keyboards included in a user interface of the machine. The
machine will then process the transaction, dispense currency notes or accept a
deposit item as may be requested, and return the card to the user as part of a
routine operation. If a financial document is deposited, the document is
transported to reading and printing means for automatic processing of the
document, after which the document is deposited in container means.In an automatic document processing system in which a document is fed
past reading means or printing means arranged to read information carried on
the document, or to print information at predetermined locations on the
document, it is important that the document is accurately aligned relative to the
document feed path so that correct reading or printing takes place.From EP-A-0473884 there is known a document alignment system
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 and
for use
in a printer in which documents are aligned relative to a feed path by bringing
each document into parallel abutting contact with a reference surface parallel to
the feed path. This known system includes first and second drive rolls
respectively associated with a pinch roll and a wobble roll. The pinch roll is
selectively brought into cooperative relationship with the first drive roll for the
purpose of driving a document along the feed path, and the wobble roll is
selectively brought into cooperative relationship with the second drive roll for
the purpose of moving the document into abutting relationship with the reference
surface, the wobble roll being in a non-operative position with respect to its
associated drive roll when the pinch roll is in an operative position with respect
to its associated drive roll, and vice versa. In the course of an alignment 
operation, the relevant drive roll is driven forwards and backwards a number of
times, the axis of the wobble roll pivoting with each

<CLAIMS>
A document alignment system including drive means (34) operative to
drive documents one by one along a feed path, and alignment means (100,112)

operative to bring an edge of each document into parallel abutting contact with a
reference surface (72) parallel to said feed path, said alignment means being

operative when said drive means (34) is non-operative and being non-operative
when said drive means is operative, characterized in that said alignment means

includes a plurality of alignment rolls (100) spaced apart in a direction parallel
to said feed path and being mounted with their axes non-perpendicular

to said
feed path, and a plurality of spring biased, rotatably mounted balls (112)

respectively arranged to cooperate with said alignment rolls, said alignment rolls
being arranged to be driven in the course of an alignment operation so as to

drive a document towards said reference surface (72) with the document gripped
resiliently between said alignment rolls (100) and said balls (112).
A document alignment system according to claim 1, characterized in
that each of said alignment rolls (100) includes a flattened peripheral portion

(102) which is arranged to face the respective ball (112), and to be out of
contact therewith, when said alignment means (100,112) is inoperative.
A document alignment system according to either claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that said balls (112) are arranged to hold a document present in

said alignment system against a surface of guide means (88) when said
alignment means (110,112) is inoperative, said alignment rolls (100) being

arranged to come into cooperative relationship with said balls (112) via openings
(104) in said guide means.
A document alignment system according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said drive means (34) includes a plurality of drive

rolls (42) respectively arranged to cooperate with a plurality of idler rolls (44),
each of said drive rolls including a flattened peripheral portion (48) which is

arranged to face the respective idler roller, and to be out of contact therewith,
when said drive means is inoperative.
A document alignment system according to claims 3 and 4,
characterized in said idler rolls (44) are partially accommodated in openings (92)

in said guide means (88), with that part of the periphery of each idler roll
nearest the respective drive roll (42) being substantially level with said surface

of said guide means. 
A document alignment system according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in the course of an alignment operation said

alignment rolls (100) are arranged to drive a document away from said reference
surface (72) before driving this document towards said reference surface.
A document alignment system according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the axes of said alignment rolls (100) are

substantially parallel to said feed path.
A document alignment system according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that each of said alignment rolls (100) comprises an

inner member (108) of hard material around which is formed a sleeve (110) of
compressible rubber.
A document alignment system according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said drive means (34) is arranged to drive a

document in a first direction along said feed path prior to an alignment operation
taking place in respect of the document, and is arranged to drive the document

in the opposite direction along said feed path after an alignment operation has
taken place in respect of the document.
A document alignment system according to claim 9, characterized by
first and second sensor means (128 and 130) respectively located adjacent to

opposite ends of said alignment system in relation to said feed path, said second
sensor means (130) being spaced from said first sensor means (128) in said first

direction, and said drive means (34) being arranged to stop, prior to an
alignment operation being carried out, in response to said first sensor means

(128) sensing a trailing edge of a document, or in response to said second sensor
means (130) sensing a leading edge of this doc
ument, whichever occurs first.
