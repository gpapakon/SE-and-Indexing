<ABSTRACT>
Yellow, magenta and cyan ink compositions to be used in color ink-jet recording and a solvent system 
suitable for color ink compositions to be used in color ink-jet recording. These compositions reproduce ideal color 

tones irrespective of paper qualities and are excellent in intermittent delivery stability. Also disclosed is a color ink 
jet recording method using these compositions, wherein printing is performed by applying them one on another to mix 

various colors. The resultant color, too, has an ideal tone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink composition
for use in color ink jet printing and more particularly
to a yellow ink composition, a magenta ink composition, a
solvent system suitable for a color ink composition and a
color ink jet printing method using said ink
compositions.In the "color ink jet printing method" wherein a
color image is formed using an ink jet printing method,
it is a common technique to use at least a yellow ink, a
magenta ink and a cyan ink.In the color ink jet printing method, ink
compositions for respective colors, as such, should first
have a good color production property. In particular, it
is preferred for a color to be faithfully produced even
on plain paper, especially on acid paper.Furthermore, there is a color ink jet printing
method wherein, in addition to three colors (yellow,
magenta and cyan), four colors of red, green, blue and
black are formed by overprinting the three color ink
compositions, i.e., a yellow ink, a magenta ink and a
cyan ink, to effect seven colors printing. (Black may be
formed by over-printing yellow, magenta and cyan, or
alternatively, a black ink may be used.)In this type of the color ink jet printing method,
besides the good color production property of the ink
compositions perse, it is important for the color ink
compositions to produce faithful color tone of red, green
and blue when mixed by overprinting. In general, an ink
composition which has a good color production property
when used alone cannot be expected to have a good color
production property when mixed by overprinting.
Furthermore, in many cases, even though a good colors can 
be realized on coated pater, a poor colors are produced
on paper which has a high acidity. For this reason,
there is a demand for ink compositions and combinations
thereof that can realize the good color production when
mixed by overprinting without limiting by properties of
recording paper.Furthermore, the color ink composition for ink jet
printing should have properties commonly required for ink
jet printing, such as cause neither clogging of nozzles
nor a change in composition and properties during
storage. In particular, after a printing is suspended
for a certain period, it is desirable that the printing
start without any troubles such as the deviation of the
ink droplets from the ink path and the missing of dots.
It is preferable that the "suspending period" that is a
period by the time when the deviation of the ink droplets
or the missing of dots is observed should be long. An ink
composition which
