<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a bore mapping 
system that includes one or more high resolution ultrasonic 

mapping transducers that are used to measure the diameter 
of a bore. The travel time for a normally incident pulse 

to reach the bore surface and return for each transducer is 
used with a reference reflection time measured in a cali­

bration bore to determine the measured diameter from a 
mechanically measured reference diameter using a known 

velocity of the ultrasonic pulse in an immersion fluid. 
The diameter measured by each of the transducers is aver­

aged to obtain an average measured diameter which is 
produced for plural axial rotor positions. The present 

invention also includes a surface time measurement system 
that uses at least one ranging transducer measuring the 

ranging time required for a ranging beam to reach and 
return from the bore surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a bore 
mapping and surface time measurement system for a bore hole 
in a material such as metal and, more particularly, the 
present invention is directed to a bore mapping system 
which maps the diameter of a power generating plant turbine 
rotor bore and measures the time required for an ultrasonic 
wave to reach the bore surface for later use to correct the 
transit time of an angled beam refracted by the bore 
surface to create a shear mode interrogation beam during a 
shear mode ultrasonic bore inspection. Power generating station turbines and generator 
rotors have variable diameter bore holes extending along 
their central axis over part or all of their lengths. 
Because the rotors experience the highest stress within 
approximately the first ten centimetres (four inches) in rotor radius, the 
detection of major near bore flaws and the monitoring of 
flaw location as well as size determinations are of critical 
importance in determining rotor life expectancy. As a 
result, at the end of the manufacturing process and during 
periodic routine rotor maintenance, the bores are inspected 
for flaws and occasionally remachined over all or part of 
their surface to remove the flaws. To accurately perform 
the inspection, the precise geometry in the bore of a 
particular rotor must be determined. Prior to a rotor 
inspection, the inside diameter of the bore, as a function 
of axial position along the bore, needs to be determined to  
 
allow inspection transducers to be properly calibrated and 
manipulated during the inspection. One method of obtaining bore diameter information 
is to manually insert a mechanical measurement device into 
the bore and record the diameter at discrete locations 
along the length of the bore. One such mechanical measurement 
device is called a "Star Gauge". The "Star Gauge" 
measures diameter by mechanically positioning arms inside 
the bore. The mechanical system suffers from drawbacks 
related to limited axial resolution and inevitable human 
error associated with gauge positioning. In addition, such 
mechanical measuring devices are difficult to align on bore 
slopes and tapers. The ultrasonic inspection of the rotor bore 
involves transporting an ultrasonic transducer through the 
bore and consists of a combination of circumferential 
rotation and axial displacement allowing the ultrasonic 
beam to pass through all of the material of interest. In 
an immersion type system, the inspection transducer does 
not contact the bore surface
