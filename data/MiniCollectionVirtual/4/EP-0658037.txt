<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus and, more particularly, to an image forming
apparatus such as a digital copying machine which
includes a memory means, e.g., a page memory.As an apparatus of this type, an image forming
apparatus such as a color digital copying machine is
widely known. In such an image forming apparatus, an
optical system is moved to illuminate an original, and
the reflected light from the original is read by a
photoelectric conversion device such as a CCD and
output after being subjected to various image
processing operations.Generally, an image forming apparatus of this type
includes an image transfer member such as a transfer
drum, and color-separated images of magenta, cyan,
yellow, and black are sequentially overlapped on this
transfer member to form a color image.As recording paper cassettes for storing sheets of
recording paper for printing out color images formed,
A3-, A4-, B4-, and B5-size cassettes, for example, are
prepared in correspondence with the sizes of recording 
paper. In copying an A3-size original by reducing it to
an A4 copy size, an A4R-size recording paper cassette
which is the lateral form of A4-size recording paper is
also required. Likewise, a B5R-size recording paper
cassette is necessary when a B4-size original is to be
copied by reducing to a B5 copy size.Unfortunately, the above conventional apparatuses
have the following problems.That is, the access time of, e.g., a DRAM used as
the page memory has its limit, and this restricts the
rate of read and write of image signals. Therefore, the
image formation speed cannot be raised in forming images
by reading out image signals from the memory. In
addition, if the number of recording paper cassettes is
increased to meet various sizes of recording paper for
use in printing out images, a paper feed mechanism is
complicated and increased in size. This unavoidably
increases the size of an apparatus. It is a concern of the present invention to solve
the above conventional problems.It is another concern of the present invention to
provide an image forming apparatus capable of processing
an image signal with a high efficiency.European Patent Specification No EP-A-0457572
discloses apparatus for receiving print data which can
be binary and/or multi-value data from an external
apparatus and in which memory space is efficiently
utilised by making the memory capacity available for
binary data variable in accordance with the amount of
multi-value data. According to one aspect of the present
