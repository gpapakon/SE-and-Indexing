<ABSTRACT>
A method and circuitry are provided for detecting and 
measuring a phase difference between the output signals 

from a primary stratum clock and a standby stratum clock in 
a telecommunications system, computing a period of time 

needed for a numerically-controlled oscillator to shift the 
frequency of the standby clock enough to cancel the phase 

difference, transforming the required period of time into 
a signal representing a corresponding number of frequency 

shift steps, and controlling the numerically-controlled 
oscillator with the step signal to shift the frequency of 

the standby clock accordingly and thereby cancel the phase 
difference. Both the frequency and phase alignments of the 

two clocks are thus maintained. Therefore, when either the 
system or user switches operations from the primary stratum 

clock module to the standby stratum clock module, phase-related 
transients are not generated, which results in a 

significant increase in the overall performance and 
reliability of the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned generally with 
high-speed telecommunications systems, and more 
specifically with techniques for improving the operability 
and reliability of high-speed telecommunications systems. 
Even more specifically, the invention is concerned with a 
method and circuitry for minimizing switching transients in 
a high-speed telecommunications system by aligning the 
phase of a primary stratum clock with the phase of a backup 
or standby clock prior to switching operational use from 
the primary clock to the standby clock.  Purchasers of telecommunications systems are highly 
influenced by the reliability of these systems. In fact, 
for most users of high-speed telecommunications systems, 
high reliability is essential. Consequently, designers of 
telecommunications systems commonly use redundant 
components and circuits to increase the reliability of 
their systems. For example, if a fault develops in a 
critical portion of the system, then the redundant 
component or circuit automatically takes over the function 
of the faulty portion. Alternatively, and also by way of 
example, a user may switch an operation to a redundant 
component or circuit for maintenance purposes. 
Subsequently, the primary component or circuit may be 
replaced by a new part. In order to maximize 
maintainability and minimize fabrication costs, 
manufacturers of high-speed telecommunications systems 
typically provide interchangeable primary and redundant 
components or circuits. In a known configuration, which will be described in 
detail below, a plurality of primary Stratum Clock modules 
and redundant, "hot standby" Stratum Clock modules are 
included in a high-speed telecommunications system. These 
Stratum Clock modules are used to provide clock pulses, 
free of jitter and wander, required to synchronize certain 
discrete, integrated circuits that make up the system. 
Typically, the primary and standby Stratum Clock modules 
are interchangeable as to both location and function, and 
may operate in a reversible master-slave configuration in 
which the master is the frequency reference for the slave. 
The master could be either tracking an external source or 
be operating in a free-running condition. For example, 
FIGURE 1 shows two stratum synchronizers arranged in a 
typical master/slave configuration. If the quality of the 
primary clock's signals degrades significantly, or the 
operation of the primary clock is disrupted, then the  
 
system switches operational use over to the standby clock 
mod
