<ABSTRACT>
A water-resistant electrical connector includes a 
housing (10) having at least one cavity (11) dedicated to 

receive a terminal fixture (30) and at least one cavity (21) 
which is configured to prevent a terminal fixture (30) from 

being inserted therein. Although both of the cavities (11, 
21) are open at opposite ends of the housing (10), a wall 

(10a) closes up the cavity (21) which is not to receive a 
terminal fixture (30) constituting an electric circuit. 

This wall (10a) prevents water from passing through the 
cavity (21) from one side of the housing (10) to the other. 

A fin (27) also extends across this cavity (21) from an open 
end of the cavity (21) to the wall (10a) to thereby prevent 

a terminal fixture (30) from being inserted in the cavity 
(21) and into contact with the wall (10a). A molding system 

can manufacture connector housings (10) having various 
combinations of the cavities (11) configured to receive a 

terminal fixture (30) and cavities (21) which prevent a 

terminal fixture (30) from being inserted therein. The 
molding system includes a fixed mold (65), a movable mold 

(67), and pairs of mold pins (61, 62) which are detachably 
mountable to the molds (65, 67). One pair of the mold pins 

(61, 62) will form a cavity (11) configured to receive a 
terminal fixture (30) while another pair of the mold pins 

(72, 74) will form a cavity (21) which will prevent a  
 

terminal fixture (30) from being inserted therein. The 
respective pairs of the mold pins (61, 62; 72, 74) are 

interchangeable so that the same molds (65, 67) can be used 
to manufacture various types of housings (10) depending on 

the circuit to which the connector is applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector of a wire harness
of an automobile or the like and, more particularly, to a
connector having an improved water-resistant structure.A connector having a housing adapted to receive a
terminal fixture of a wire harness of an automobile of the
like is known. A terminal cavity for the reception of the
terminal fixture is formed in the connector housing with the
two ends of the terminal cavity constituting an insertion-side
opening through which a terminal fixture is inserted
and a connection-side opening through which a mating
connector is inserted. That is, the terminal fixture is
inserted through the insertion-side opening with the tip
thereof facing the connection-side opening. Afterwards, the
terminal fixture within this terminal cavity and the
terminal fixture of the mating connector are connected via
the connection-side opening.Water-resistance measures in such a connector include a
rubber seal fitted to the junction of the terminal fixture
and the lead wires electrically connected thereto. The
rubber seal forms a watertight seal at the insertion-side
opening when the terminal fixture is inserted into the
terminal cavity thereby preventing the penetration of water
from the insertion-side opening to within the terminal
cavity.However, because such a connector is a general-use part 
for forming various electrical circuits, i.e. is configured
depending on the circuit in which it is employed, terminal
fixtures may not be inserted into all of the terminal
cavities. That is, some of the terminal cavities may be
left vacant. A dummy plug made of rubber and having an
outer diameter similar to that of the rubber seal is
commonly inserted as a water-resistant measure for such
vacant cavities. Of course, whether a vacant terminal
cavity like that described above will be left in the
connector can be ascertained in the circuit design stage.
Therefore, it is possible to forego this route and instead
manufacture specialized connector housings of different
specifications by means of differing molds so that excess
terminal cavities to be left vacant are not formed.
However, such a change in specifications involves a change
in the basic structure of the mold. This creates an
increase in cost because a completely different mold must be
manufactured. This increase in cost is rather prohibitive.
For reasons such as this, the combination of a general-use
connector with dummy plugs has become commonplace in the
prior art.However, the following problems are associated with
this connector.
