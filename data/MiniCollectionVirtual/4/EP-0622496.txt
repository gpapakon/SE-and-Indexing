<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing a sewer, including the following steps:   - moulding a central element (50) of vertical axis having essentially the shape of a hollow cylinder closed at the bottom of variable height, - moulding two peripheral elements (60, 70) of horizontal axis each essentially having the shape of a hollow cylinder emerging on both sides between a flat face and a concave face (62, 72), the curvature of which matches the outer face of the hollow cylinder of the central element of vertical axis, - drilling the vertical wall of the central element in order to form at least two lateral orifices (51, 52) of horizontal axis and forming between them an angle A selected to order, with possibly different levels, - assembling the sewer by attaching each peripheral element respectively facing each drilling of the central element.

Method for the manufacture of a concrete culvert,
or concrete inspection hole bottom, arranged to connect

at least two flow pipes, the axis of each of which is
substantially horizontal, comprising the following steps:


the casting in concrete of a one-piece central
element (50) having a vertical axis and being essentially

in the form of a downwardly closed hollow cylinder,
the casting in concrete of at least two peripheral
elements (60, 70) having a horizontal axis,
the cutting through of the vertical wall of the
central element in order to form at least two lateral

orifices (51, 52), the axis of each of which is horizontal
and which form with one another an angle A selected

as a function of the flow pipes, each cut-through being
intended respectively to be coaxial relative to one of

the flow pipes,
the assembling of the culvert,

characterized in that

the peripheral elements each have a plane face and
a concave face (62, 72), the curvature of which matches

the outer face of the hollow cylinder of the central
element having a vertical axis, and they each have a

cylindrical cut-through opening out on both sides,
the culvert is assembled by externally attaching
each peripheral element respectively opposite each cut-through

of the central element.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to Claim 1, characterized in that the step of cutting

through the central element (50) having a vertical axis 
is integrated into the casting step, with a reserve being

inserted in the skin of the vertical wall for the lateral
orifices.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the assembly step

is carried out by adhesively bonding each peripheral
element to the central element.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the assembly step

is carried out by mechanically fastening each peripheral
element to the central element.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the lateral orifices (51, 52) are located at different
heights which each correspond to the height of the axis

of the flow pipe to be connected.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the inside diameters of each peripheral element having a
horizontal axis are different.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

a male or female connector is provided on the plane face
(61, 71) of each peripheral element.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to Claim 7, characterized in that the male or female

connector is provided with a gasket.
Method for the manufacture of a culvert according
to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the culvert has a variable height of between 300 and
2,500 mm.
