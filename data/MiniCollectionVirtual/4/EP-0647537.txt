<ABSTRACT>
A beam, bar or other like article, especially 
for motor vehicles, which in use is subjected to 

torsional forces, comprises a substantially straight 
centre portion (12) and end portions (13) set at an 

angle to the centre portion. At least the tubular 
centre portion (12) has its torsional stiffness 

modified by the provision of a slot (34) in the tube 
and by deformation of walls (16, 18) of the tube. The 

slot (34) preferably extends into the end portions 
(13). Depending upon needs, one can provide a slot or 

slots, or deform a wall or walls, or both.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to articles such as 
beams, tubes, bars and other like sections, which in 
use are subject to torsional forces. The invention is 
also concerned with methods of manufacturing such 
elongate tubular articles. The invention is particularly applicable to 
the manufacture of components for the automotive 
industry, e.g. rear axle beams, anti-roll bars, etc. In the automotive industry it is known to 
manufacture certain components, such as sub-frame 
tubes, by a process known as hydroforming. This 
involves the application of hydraulic pressure, in a 
die, and possibly also the use of movable die inserts, 
to change the contour of a section. In the 
conventional process the tube or other section is 
constrained to keep a constant cross-sectional area, 
although local deformation can be introduced by the use 
of movable die inserts. There is a particular problem in the 
automotive industry relating to the production of a 
"torsion twist beam" rear axle for motor vehicles. The 
conventional torsion twist beam rear axle comprises a 
standard beam, and if one wishes to increase the 
torsional stiffness for higher performance or heavier 
models of a particular vehicle then one has to "add on" 
components to produce the desired effect. For example, 
additional torsion springs are added to one basic rear 
axle, to give the required range of torsional 
stiffness. This results in increased cost and 
complexity, and also increased weight. It is also known from EP-0229576 to 
manufacture a semi-rigid axle of U-shaped configuration  
 
for a vehicle, where the axle has a tubular central 
zone and two arms, one at each end of the central zone, 
wherein the central zone is so profiled as to have at 
least one limb of double wall structure. With this 
construction the central portion of the axle is 
substantially deformed, with walls of the section in 
face-to-face contact. It is an object of the present invention to 
apply hydroforming and other techniques and 
modifications thereof to the manufacture of components 
which in use are subject to torsional forces, in order 
thereby to obtain a desired torsional stiffness for the 
component. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide components and methods of making them where one 
can vary the torsional stiffness, so that one can 
create components having a particular desired torsional 
stiffness, to order as it were. It is yet a further object of the invention 
to provide elongate tubular articles which in use are 
subject to torsional

<CLAIMS>
An elongate tubular article (10) which in 
use is subjected to torsional forces, comprising a 

substantially straight centre portion (12) and 
respective end portions forming arms (13) set at an 

angle to the centre portion, in which at least the 
tubular centre portion (12) has its torsional stiffness 

modified to a predetermined value or values by the 
provision of a slot or slots (26, 28; 34) in the tube 

and/or by deformation (20, 22; 20, 32) of a wall or 
walls of the tube in such a manner as to reduce the 

enclosed area and maintain a single substantial 
passageway therethrough. 
An article as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the centre portion (12) has 

lengthwise slots (26, 28) therein in opposed walls (18, 
16) of the tube. 
An article as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the centre portion (12) of the 

tube is deformed (20, 32) on opposed sides. 
An article as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the centre portion (12) of the 

tube is deformed (20) on one side only. 
An article as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that at least one of the deformed 

zones (20; 32) has a lengthwise slot (28; 34) therein. 
An article as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised in that the deformed zone (20; 32) has a 

lengthwise slot (28; 34) therein. 
An article as claimed in any preceding 
claim, which has at least one slot (34) lengthwise of 

the centre portion (12), with the slot or at least one 
of the slots ex
tending from the centre portion (12) 
into the end portions (13). 
An article as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the centre portion (12) is 

substantially rectangular in cross-section, and a wall 
(16; 18) of the centre portion is deformed so that a 

part thereof lies outwardly of the original plane (24; 
35) of the wall and a part thereof lies inwardly of the 

said plane. 
An article as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the centre portion (12) is 

substantially rectangular in cross-section, and two 
opposed walls (16, 18) of the centre portion are 

deformed, one to form an inward protuberance (20) and 
one to form an outward protuberance (32). 
An article as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised by a wall deformation (32) 

extending from the centre portion (12) into the end 
portions (13). 
A method of manufacturing an elongate

forces, which comprises forming the article with a 
substantially straight centre portion and respective 

end portions forming arms set at an angle to the centre

portion and/or a wall or walls of the centre portion 

are deformed in such a manner as to reduce the enclosed 
area and maintain a single substantial passageway 

therethrough, thereby to modify the torsional stiffness 
of the centre portion.
