<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a decoder of teletext 
(Televideo) signals of the type known as TOP, equipped with 

four coloured selection keys; the main characteristic of the 
invention consists in that the decoder provides two 

sequential exploration keys (+ and -), the function of which 
is determined by the selection carried out by way of one of 

said coloured keys.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decoder of teletext 
signals of the type known as TOP, equipped with four coloured 
selection keys. It is known that in various European countries, among which 
Italy, systems are in use (generally known with the English 
word "teletext", and more precisely designated in Italy as 
"Televideo" and in Germany as "Videotext") that allow for the 
transmission, together with the normal television signals, of 
additional information, inserted in the video signal (under 
the form of digital coded signals) in some of the free 
horizontal lines during the period of vertical retrace. These coded signals, upon a command by the user, are detected 
by an appropriate circuit decoder, known and normally 
realised by means of monolithic integrated circuits, inserted 
in the circuits of the television, so as to allow for the 
display on the television screen one of the information pages 
transmitted, containing text and graphics. The pages normally transmitted are of several hundreds, 
grouped by subject (for example: latest news: pages 110-125, 
sport: pages 150-162, politics: pages 210-222, games: pages 
315-345, etc.); the first page (page 100) usually contains 
the general subject index, and in the successive pages the 
sub-indexes for each subject, with the relative page numbers.  
 The user has to, each time it is desired to receive a 
determined page, input a sequence using three numbered keys 
so as to form the three digit number of the searched page; 
the decoder begins to receive the pages as they are 
transmitted, one after the other, by the broadcaster; as soon 
as the page distinguished by the sequence of digits inputted 
by the user is transmitted, the decoder provides for its 
acquisition. The main drawback of teletext is the time necessary for the 
acquisition; numerous systems have been proposed for reducing 
such drawback (TOP, FLOF, TOPLESS). In the TOP system the grouping of the pages is organised 
according to a structure of two levels (blocks and groups). 
The command device, generally a remote control, is equipped 
with four supplement keys, each coloured in a different 
manner, which allow for the access, respectively, to the next 
page of the group, to the first page of the next group 
(typically containing the relative index), to the first page 
of the successive block (typically containing the relative 
index), to the previous page selected. In other 
implementations the fourth access key provides access to the 
previous page of the group. Such an

Decoder for a receiver of teletext signals, transmitted according to the 
system known as TOP, namely a system where the grouping of the teletext 

pages or files, a file 
consisting of a number of sub-pages, is organised according to 

a two-level structure in blocks and groups, wherein a group belongs to a block, and where the command device of 
said decoder is equipped with four additional keys, each one coloured in a 

different manner, which, when a teletext page or file of a group is selected and displayed onto the screen of the 
teletext signal receiver, allow for the access, respectively, to the next page of the same 

group, to the first page, namely the index page, of the next group, to the first 
page, namely the index page, of the next block, and to the previously selected 

page or to the previous page of the group, 
characterised in that
 the decoder 
provides two sequential exploration keys (+,-), the function of which is 

determined by the selection carried out by way of one of said additional coloured 
keys, and that the decoder has logic means (101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 108, 

109, 110) and wherein, by respectively depressing the said additional keys, the decoder is 
activated for flipping, by means of said sequential exploration keys (+, -), in one 

sense or another, through the pages, or respectively the sub-pages, belonging to 
one of the following groups or blocks: 


the pages of the actually selected group, namely the group to which the 
displayed page pertains, when the first additional key is depressed; 
the first pages, namely the indexes, of all groups, when the second additional key is depressed; 
the first pages, namely the indexes, of all the blocks, when the third additional key is depressed; 
the sub-pages belonging to the selected file of actually selected group, when the fourth additional key is depressed. 
Decoder of teletext signals, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
it has logic means (104,105), which provide the possibility that, when depressing the 

additional key which introduces the possibility of flipping through the indexes of 
the groups, also produces the immediate display of the index of the group to 

which the displayed page pertains. 
Decoder of teletext signals, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
it has logic means (106,107), which provide the possibility that, when depressing the 

additional key which introduces the possibility of flipping through the indexes of 
the blocks, also produces the immediate display of the index of the block to 

which the displayed page pertains. 
Receiver of television signals comprising the teletext signal receiver 
according to one or more of the previous claims.
