<DESCRIPTION>
Polymer beads are usually produced by free radical suspension 
polymerization, a well known process developed in 1909. 
See Hofman et al., Ger. Pat. 250,690 (1909). Porous polymer 
beads based on, for example, poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) are 
widely used in the synthesis of ion-exchange resins. In 
addition, significant speciality applications exist for the use 
of such polymer beads in areas related to separation science. 
These applications include separation of enantiomers from racemic 
mixtures, analysis of blood samples, water purification, and 
high-performance liquid chromatography. Some of these speciality applications require or would 
benefit from the use of polymer beads which have unique surface 
properties. For example, when a conventional column containing 
hydrophobic polymer beads is used in the analysis of human 
plasma, the proteins in the blood plasma are denatured on the 
hydrophobic surface of the beads. This eventually destroys the 
column through clogging which increases the back pressure to such 
an extent that the column must often be replaced after only a 
very short useful lifetime. In contrast, a column packed with 
polymer beads having a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer 
layer does not suffer from the same problem because the hydrophilic 
surface does not react with blood protein so as to cause 
clogging of the column. Another speciality application is the separation of enantiomers 
from racemic mixtures. Such chromatographic separations 
require the use of beads with a chiral surface layer. These 
separations are important for the analysis, identification, or 
preparation of optically active compounds. Other possible applications for which polymer beads having 
a hydrophilic or chiral outer surface include catalysis in 
which it is sometimes desirable to segregate an active component  
 
at the surface of a solid catalyst. The selection of a reactive 
chiral or hydrophilic group and its placement at the surface of 
a polymer bead could accomplish such an active component 
segregation. In toner chemistry, it is often desirable to modify 
the surface chemistry of toner particles which are generally 
non-porous non-cross-linked polymer particles. Currently this 
is performed through the use of simple mixtures or coatings of 
the toner particles with the desired additives. While some polymer beads with hydrophilic surfaces are 
available, the processes used to produce such polymer beads are 
difficult to perform, are limited in the types of monomers and 
groups

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing surface functionalized polymer 
materials characterized by (i) adding a non-emulsified functional 

monomer which further contains at least one polymerizable vinyl 
group into an aqueous phase of a dispersion of soluble polymer 

particles which are insoluble in water and soluble in an organic 
material in the dispersion, and which are swollen with an emulsion 

of a polymerizable 
hydrophobic
 vinyl monomer and (ii) copolymerizing 
(a) the emulsified monomer in the swollen particles 

and (b) the non-emulsified functional monomer, thereby forming 
an insoluble polymer particle having a hydrophobic polymer core 

and a functionalized polymer outer layer. 
The process of Claim 1, characterized by an additional 
step of (iii) extracting the soluble polymer materials so that 

the resulting surface functionalized polymer materials are porous. 
The process of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the non-emulsified functional monomer is added prior to the start 

of the polymerization. 
The process of Claim 3, characterized in that a water 
soluble polymerization inhibitor is added to the aqueous phase 

of the dispersion prior to the addition of the non-emulsified 
functional monomer. 
The process of Claims 1-4, characterized in that the 
functional monomer is added neat. 
The process of Claims 1-5, characterized in that the 
non-emulsified functional monomer is a hydrophilic monomer which 

contains at least one hydrophilic group selected from the group 
consisting essentially of hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, amido, 

imido, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, nitro, nitrile, aminoacid, 
epoxy, diol, and mixtures thereof.  

 
The process of Claims 1-5, characterized in that the 
non-emulsified functional monomer is a chiral monomer which contains 

reactive chiral groups suitable to separate racemic mixtures 
of chiral compounds and wherein the chiral monomer contains 

a polymerizable vinyl group and a pendant reactive chiral group. 
The process of Claims 1-7, characterized in that the 
dispersion of swollen soluble polymer particles is formed by dispersing 

the soluble polymer particles in water and swelling the 
particles by adding to the dispersion at least one monomer a
nd 
an initiator for polymerizing the monomer. 
The process of Claim 8, characterized in that the at 
least one monomer is a mixture of vinyl monomers, at least one 

of which is a polyvinyl monomer. 
A material obtainable according to the process of Claim 
7 characterized by a polymerized particle having a core of a 

hydrophobic material, said core enclosed by a chiral polymer surface 
layer, wherein there is a gradient between the center of the 

core and the outer surface of the chiral polymer layer, whereby 
the hydrophobic core material decreases in amount as it approaches 

the outer chiral layer so as to form an intermediate 
layer containing both chiral polymer and hydrophobic material 

between the core and the outer chiral polymer layer.
