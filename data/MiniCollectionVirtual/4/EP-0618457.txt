<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a magnet apparatus for 
producing a uniform magnetic field for magnetic 

resonance imaging (MRI). The magnet apparatus is of the 
type having a pair of permanent magnet discs each of 

which has a hole in a central region and a yoke 
structure in which the magnet discs are held opposite to 

each other. For each magnet disc the yoke structure has 
an aperture which is in alignment with the hole in the 

magnet disc. As is usual, a pair of pole plates are 
attached to the opposite faces of the magnet discs, 

respectively, so as to produce a uniform magnetic field 
in a space between the two magnet discs. To ease visual 

observation of the object of imaging in the aforementioned 
sapce, such as the head part of a human body, 

the pole plate on each magnet disc is formed with a hole 
which is in alignment with the hole in the magnet disc. 

A video camera can be used. According to the need small 
pole pieces are attached to the surfaces of the holed 

pole plates to keep uniformity of the magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnet apparatus for
producing a magnetic field for use in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The apparatus is of the type having two
oppositely arranged permanent magnets.MRI is a process to form sectional images of
biological tissues placed in a uniform magnetic field.
In the current medical treatments this process is very
useful as a diagnostic tool to obtain cross-sectional
images of selected parts of the human body.A MRI apparatus has a magnet unit to produce a
uniform magnetic field in a limited but sufficiently
wide space within the apparatus, and for this purpose
several types of magnet units are known.Some MRI apparatus employ a pair of permanent
magnet discs each of which is magnetized in the
direction of thickness. In a yoke structure the two
magnet discs are arranged parallel and opposite to each
other, usually in a vertical direction, such that a pole
face of one magnet disc faces the opposite pole face of
the other. For example, the yoke structure has top and
bottom plate parts to which the two magnet discs are
fixed, respectively, and a plurality of pillar parts
which connect the top and bottom plate parts. To
produce a uniform magnetic field within a cylindrical
space between the two magnet discs, a pole plate (pole
piece) in the form of a disc having an annular
protuberance in a peripheral region is placed on the
pole face of each magnet disc. The pole plate is made
of a ferromagnetic material such as soft iron. In some
cases each of the permanent magnet discs has a hole in a 
central region, and for each magnet disc the yoke
structure has an aperture which is in alignment with the
hole in the magnet disc. For diagnosis with MRI
apparatus of this type the human body is partly and
horizontally inserted into the space between the two
magnet discs through openings in the yoke structure.In operating a MRI apparatus of the above described
type it is not easy for a MRI engineer to observe the
state of the object of imaging. For instance, when the
object of imaging is the head part of a human body the
engineer is obliged to look into the imaging space in
the apparatus in a direction along the lying patient,
but it is difficult to clearly grasp the state of the
head part or the patient's expression since the spacing
between the two magnet discs in the apparatus is only
about 50 cm. If it is intended to resolve this
inconvenience by widening the spacing between the two
magnet discs there arises a problem that the magnetic
field in the apparatus is degraded in both
