The water tank (4) exhibits a removable cladding (20) which at least partially conceals the water tank (4). Said cladding is designed as an embellishment for the water tank (4). A plurality of claddings of extremely different forms can be optionally fastened on the water tank. The cladding (20) can be fastened releasably on the water tank (4) and/or on a wall surface on which the water tank is mounted. It is supported on a floor surface of the room. The flushing device exhibits at least one fastening element (62) which is arranged on the water tank and/or on the wall surface and, once the cladding (20) has been fitted, interacts with a fastening element (64) arranged on the inner side of the cladding (20). Fitted on the water tank is a fastening element (62) which exhibits a receiving hollow which extends in the vertical direction and into which a fastening element (64) which is fastened on the cladding is latched from above.
