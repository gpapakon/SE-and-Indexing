<ABSTRACT>
A hull of a small craft such as a yacht which, if 
overturned, can return to its original normal position 

making use of its own buoyant force. A partitioning wall 
is provided at its longitudinally central portion to define 

a closed space in front thereof. A cockpit provided in the 
rear of the partitioning wall is defined by the side boards 

and a floor board. A shallow closed space is formed 
between the floor board and the bottom of the yacht.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the hull of a small craft 
such as a yacht, fishing boat or motorboat which can 
reliably turn back to its normal position if overturned by 
winds or side waves. Today's yachts used in open-sea yacht races have 
various means for preventing them from being overturned 
even if inclined considerably due to winds or waves and 
means for allowing them to restore their original position 
if overturned. Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication 60-42190 
discloses a yacht of this type. It has a mast for hoisting 
sails at a longitudinal center of the hull. A center board 
as a weight protrudes from its bottom. A space called a 
cockpit is provided which extends for the entire length or 
at least for the rear half of the hull. A pilot sits in 
the cockpit to steer the yacht. Further, this yacht has 
closed spaces defined between the inner boards forming the 
cockpit and the side boards on both sides of the hull. Fig. 8 shows a typical yacht used in open-sea yacht 
races. In order to provide stability against the rolling 
of the yacht, its side boards 1 have a streamlined 
configuration and the width of the hull is the largest at 
its longitudinal center. This yacht has a canopy 4, a deck  
 
5, a cockpit 6, a mast 7 and a center board 8. The cockpit 
6 is a recess in which a pilot can sit. Except the cockpit 
6 and the canopy 4, the top of the yacht is completely 
covered with the deck 5. Today, an increasing number of people are taking part 
in various international yacht races including such race 
events as Japan-Guam yacht race '92 "Marine-Marine" and 
America's Cup and some of them were involved in tragic 
accidents resulting from overturned yachts. Concerning today's yachts, the following problem was 
pointed out in a report titled "Warning from the 
investigation of the Guam race accident" (written by 
Kensaku Nomoto; an article in the magazine "kaji" 
(steering), November, 1992 issue), which was summed up from 
the first interim report submitted by the accident 
investigation committee. Namely, when comparing an IOR 
racer A and a cruiser B, an older type than the IOR, type A 
is overturned if the heel angle exceeds 110°, while type B 
is not overturned until it approaches somewhere near 160°. 
Once type A is overturned, it stabilizes in the overturned 
state. Although type B is less likely to be overturned, it 
is difficult to return it to its original position once 
overturned. The stability curve of the conventional yachts as 
described above depends upon their hull structure,

<CLAIMS>
A hull of a small craft comprising a bottom, a pair 
of side boards extending upwards from both edges of said 

bottom, said side boards being contiguous to each other at 
front portion thereof, a partitioning wall provided at a 

substantially longitudinally central portion of the hull so 
as to extend across said side boards, a deck provided in 

front of said partitioning wall so as to extend between the 
top edges of said side boards, and a floor board provided 

behind said partitioning wall and located over and spaced 
apart from said bottom, whereby forming a first closed 

space by said deck, said bottom, said side boards and said 
partitioning plate, forming a cockpit by said partitioning 

plate, said side boards and said floor board, and forming a 
second closed space by said floor board, said bottom, said 

side boards and said partitioning plate.
