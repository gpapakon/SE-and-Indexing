<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to apparatus for assembling battery plates and includes mould, generally indicated at (10) which defines a pair of ducts (11, 12) which supply respective sets of mould cavities (13, 14) via weirs (15). Each feed duct (11, 12) has a respective pair of feed passages (16, 17) and (18, 19) extending beneath it and is interconnected to the respective feed passages by generally vertical passages (20, 21). The feed passages (16-18) are fed by a pump.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for assembling 
battery plates. The term "battery" is used herein to include 
accumulators. In a conventional lead-acid battery it is 
customary to connect together the plates of each stack by 
means of a lead strap or post which is fixed to aligned lugs 
or tabs on the plates. Apparatus for casting such straps or 
post onto plate lugs is described in our British Patent No. 
2023471B. In this apparatus there is a mould having at 
least one battery strap or post mould cavity and a molten 
feed duct adjacent thereto, a weir between the feed duct and 
the cavity and a lead supply passage below the duct and 
connected to the duct by vertical passages through which 
lead can well up into the duct when lead is pumped into the 
passage, and the spill over the weir into the cavity. A 
suitable pumping arrangement is described in International 
Patent Application No. WO 91/05625. It is now desired to use bigger moulds, for example a 
single mould for assembling the plates of two batteries 
disposed end to end with one another or for large 
configuration batteries, such as truck batteries. It will 
be understood that this requires twice as much lead to be 
delivered to the mould in a comparable time scale. The 
obvious solutions are either to increase the flow rate 
through the lead supply passage or to double the cross-sectional 
area of the passage. The first leads to  
 
underfilling of the upstream end of the duct and overfilling 
of the downstream end of the duct as soon as the lead supply 
is shut off, whilst the latter results in geyser-like jets 
shooting up the upstream vertical passages. US-A-3565162 describes a casting machine having a mould 
with parallel independently fed sets of cavities. Each 
cavity is filled from an over head nozzle. The nozzles are 
arranged in respective sets, each set being fed by a single 
feed passage. From one aspect the invention provides apparatus for 
connecting a battery plate to a metal strap or post, 
including a mould having a set of post or strap mould 
cavities, a molten metal feed duct for feeding all the 
cavities in the set and extending adjacent thereto, a weir 
between the feed duct and the cavities, means for supplying 
molten lead to the duct, and hence the cavities, including 
a feed passage extending below the duct and connected to the 
duct, characterised in that the supply means includes a pump 
and in that there are at least a pair of feed passages 
extending below the duct and connected thereto. The provision of

Apparatus for connecting a battery plate to a 
metal strap or post, including a mould having a set of post 

or strap mould cavities (13 or 14), a molten metal feed duct 
(11 or 12) for feeding all the cavities in the set and 

extending adjacent thereto, a weir (15) between the feed 
duct and the cavities, means for supplying molten lead to 

the duct, and hence the cavities, including a feed passage 
extending below the duct and connected to the duct, 

characterised in that the supply means includes a pump and 
in that there are at least a pair of feed passages (16, 17 

or 18, 19) extending below the duct and connected thereto. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 wherein one feed 
passage (17,18) is connected to the duct (11,12) along or 

for substantially one half of the length of the duct, whilst 
the other feed passage (16,19) is connected to the duct 

(11,12) along or for substantially the other half of the 
duct (11,12). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the 
connection between the half of the duct which, in flow 

terms, is nearest the pump, is displaced further from its 
associated cavities than the connection for the half of the 

duct which is furthest, in flow terms, from the pump. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims wherein the feed passages are substantially parallel 

and connected to the duct by generally vertical passages up 
which lead can well.  

 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims wherein the pump is a variable speed pump. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 further comprising 
means for increasing the speed of the pump as metal is 

supplied to the duct and for subsequently reducing the 
speed of the pump. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims further comprising two parallel set of mould 

cavities, each having a molten feed duct (11,12) and at 
least a pair of feed passages (16,17 or 18,19) extending 

below each of the ducts and connected to their respective 
duct (11 or 12). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7 wherein the 
apparatus further includes at least one displacement body 

insertable into the mould to vary the volume of a duct (11 
or 12) and its associated cavities (13 or 14), so that it 

can be balanced with volume of the other duct and cavities. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims wherein the or each set of mould cavities (13 or 14) 

includes cavities for more than one battery.
