<ABSTRACT>
The mixing and dosage device for farm feed has a 
plurality of hoppers (1,8,12) for containing individual feed 

components. The hoppers (1,8,12) are individually provided 
with a dosage device (2,9,13) and with a conveyor (3,11,16) 

to a single mixer (4) from which the complete feed exits 
towards the lines for distribution to feed troughs. The 

device also has an automatic system (19) which manages at 
least one of the dosage devices (2,9,13) to obtain a time-programmed 

dosage of the feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mixing and dosage device for 
farm feed. It is known that one of the most important factors to 
be considered in animal rearing is feeding, which must meet 
the nutritional requirements of the animals, protecting the 
quality of the final product and avoiding waste; in 
particular, the administering of nutrients must follow the 
changes in the needs of the animals that occur during their 
stay in the farm. Considering the farming of chickens for fattening as an 
exemplary case, where the production cycle lasts 
approximately sixty days, this cycle is currently usually 
divided into three periods that have an equal number of 
different feeds; this produces a compromise between the need 
to avoid providing the farm with an excessively large number 
of different feeds and the wish to respond to the changes in 
the nutritional requirements of the animals, which obviously 
do not change every twenty days but day by day. The same is true, with the exception of all the 
differences related to the length of the production cycle, 
for other poultry such as turkeys and guinea fowl. This method is unsatisfactory: it is in fact demanding 
from the point of view of costs to acquire the different 
types of feed, all made by feed-making companies according 
to particular formulas; furthermore, use of said feeds is 
not optimized as the curve of the change in the nutritional 
demands of the animals is not followed closely. An aim of the present invention is to provide a mixing 
and dosage device for farm feed that allows to closely  
 
follow the changes in the nutritional requirements of farm 
animals and allows great saving in management costs. The proposed aim is achieved by a mixing and dosage 
device for farm feed, according to the invention, 
characterized in that it comprises a plurality of hoppers 
for containing the individual components, said hoppers being 
individually provided with a dosage device and with a 
conveyor to a single mixer from which the complete feed 
exits towards the lines for distribution to the troughs, an 
automatic system being furthermore provided which manages at 
least one of said dosage devices to obtain a time-programmed 
dosage of the feed. Advantageously, the automatic system present in said 
device controls the startup of the dosage devices of the 
hoppers of the individual components in order to supply said 
components to the mixer every time the lines for 
distribution to the troughs demand feed. Further characteristics and advantages will become 
appa

Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the mixer comprises a spiral-shaped 

agitator which is keyed on the same shaft as the 
screw feeder of one of the dosage devices, said spiral 

 
having the same direction as said screw feeder, a short 

spiral portion coiled around the shaft in the opposite 
direction being provided at the end of said agitator which 

is opposite to the one that faces said screw feeder. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, particularly for poultry for fattening, 

characterized in that it comprises: a hopper for containing 
the main complementary feed, provided with an independently 

motorized screw-feeder dosage device which has a constant 
flow-rate; a hopper for containing a simple feed, provided 

with an independently motorized screw-feeder dosage device 
which has a variable flow-rate; a micro-dosage device with a 

hopper for special products, which is connected to the 
constant flow-rate dosage device by means of a mechanical 

transmission; and a microprocessor for the automatic 
management of the dosage of the feed throughout the 

production cycle. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the agitator of the mixer is 

keyed on the shaft of the screw feeder of the dosage device 
for the main complementary feed. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the mechanical transmission of 

the motion between the constant flow-rate dosage device and 
the micro-dosage device has a single transmission ratio. 
Device according to one or more of the preceding
