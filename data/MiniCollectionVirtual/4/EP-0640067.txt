<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the reduction of the o-alkyl 
isomer content of 5-[N-(2-acetoxyethyl)-acetoxyacetamido]-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide 
to thereby reduce and/or eliminate the 
production of those impurities comparatively more difficult 
to remove during the purification of ioversol. Ioversol is disclosed as a useful nonionic x-ray contrast 
agent in US-A-4,396,598. 5-[N-(2-acetoxyethyl)-acetoxyacetamido]-N,N'-bis( 
2,3,-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide, 
hereinafter 
referred to as "Compound A", having the following 
structure: 
  
 
is an intermediate compound in the production of ioversol. 
The compound of Formula I and its use in the production of 
ioversol is likewise disclosed in US-A-4,396,598 
incorporated herein by reference. Compound A as 
disclosed in US-A-4,396,598, may be produced 
by adding 2-bromoethylacetate and potassium carbonate to a 
solution of 5-acetoxyacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide, 
illustrated in 
Formula II below and hereinafter referred to as "Compound 
B". 
 
in dimethylsulfoxide and stirring until the reaction is 
complete. The resulting Compound A is then hydrolyzed with 
water containing sulfuric acid, preferably in small amounts 
within the range of approximately zero to 25 percent, to 
produce ioversol.  
 The procedure for producing ioversol is well 
documented and heretofore required an extensive purification 
process to remove impurities formed therein during the 
above-described synthesis. An improved process that eliminates the need for such 
an extensive purification process for the purification of 
crude ioversol by significantly decreasing the impurities 
formed therein during synthesis, is desired as an enhanced 
and/or more cost efficient production method. It is an 
object of the present invention to meet these needs. US-A-4 997 983 discloses a process for the production 
of ioversol wherein a mixture of 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TCE) 
and "Compound A" or "hexaacetate" (produced by alkylation of 
"Compound B") is distilled to remove TCE, at least a part of 
which is distilled as an azeotrope with water, so that a 
solvent exchange is effected to produce a mixture of 
"hexaacetate" in water. Hydrolysis of "hexaacetate" 
produces ioversol.  
 The O-alkyl isomer of Compound A is an undesired 
impurity detectable during the synthesis of ioversol before 
the hydrolysis of the key intermediate, Compound A.
