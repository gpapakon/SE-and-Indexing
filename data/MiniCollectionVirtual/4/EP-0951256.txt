<ABSTRACT>
New methods for producing intraocular lenses (IOLs) include a combination of steps which provide outstanding pull strength between the fixation member of the IOL and the optic of the IOL without requiring the lens body region of the fixation member to have enlarged anchor structures. In one embodiment, the present methods include providing an optic member having a recess; providing a fixation member having a lens bonding region free of enlarged anchor structures; placing the lens bonding region into the recess; and thereafter doing at least one of reducing the size of the recess and increasing the cross-sectional area of the lens bonding region. The lens bonding region of the fixation member is thereby secured to the optic member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intraocular lenses (IOLs)
and to methods for producing IOLs. More particularly,
the present invention relates to very straight forward
and easy to practice methods for producing IOLs with
optics comprising polymeric materials, for example,
silicone polymeric materials. IOLs produced in
accordance with the present invention have advantageous
properties, for example, outstanding fixation member
pull strengths, that is advantageously large bond
strengths between the optic of the IOL and the fixation
member or members of the IOL.The use of IOLs to improve vision and/or to replace
damaged or diseased natural lenses in human eyes,
particularly natural lenses impaired by cataracts, has
achieved wide acceptance. Accordingly, a variety of IOLs
has been developed for surgical implantation in the
posterior or anterior chambers of the eye according to
a patient's needs.Known IOLs comprise an optical lens portion or
optic which includes an optical zone, and one or more,
preferably two, supporting structures, called fixation
members or haptics, for contacting eye tissue to fix or
hold the IOL in the proper position after implantation.
The optic may comprise a soft, resilient material, such
as a silicone polymeric material (in particular, an
elastomeric cross-linked silicone polymeric material),
an acrylic material and the like. The haptics typically
comprise a filament constructed of a resilient metal or
polymeric substance, such as polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA), polyamide, polypropylene and the like.Each of the filament haptics is preferably flexible
to reduce trauma to sensitive eye structures and to be
yielding during insertion of the IOL. In addition,
filament haptics generally have a memory retaining
capability, e.g., springiness, so that after 
implantation of an associated IOL, the filament haptics
automatically tend to return to their normal
orientation.Although the filament haptics are very useful,
certain difficulties remain. For example, filament
haptics and soft or deformable optics tend to be formed
from dissimilar materials which do not ordinarily
chemically bond together. As a result, filament haptics
have been designed having a variety of enlarged
attachment end configurations or structures, e.g.,
anchor structures, for providing a physical or
mechanical interlock between the haptic and optic.
Polypropylene haptics, for example, have been secured
into silicone polymer-based optics by means of a
mechanical lock. This lock may comprise a small loop or
other anchor formed at the
