<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
carrier having excellent durability and exhibiting a
correspondingly stable charging performance.In electrophotographic processes, a
photosensitive member comprising a photoconductive
substance, such as selenium, OPC (organic
photoconductor) or a-Si (amorphous-silicon) is used to
form an electrostatic latent image thereon by various
means. Such a latent image may be developed by a
magnetic brush developing scheme by electrostatically
attaching a toner charged to a polarity opposite to
that of the latent image in a normal development mode
or a toner charge to a polarity identical to that of
the latent image in a reversal development scheme to
visualize the latent image.In the development, carrier particles called
a magnetic carrier are used to impart an appropriate
amount of positive or negative charge to a toner by
triboelectrification and also convey the toner to a
developing region in proximity to the surface of the
photosensitive member having the latent image thereon
under application of a magnetic force exerted from a
magnet enclosed within a developing sleeve via the
developing sleeve. Hitherto, as such carrier particles, iron
articles, ferrite particles and so-called binder-type
particles that are composite particles formed by
dispersing magnetic fine particles in a binder resin,
have been proposed or commercialized. These carriers
have widely ranging electrical resistivities from a
low value as exhibited by iron particles to a high
value as exhibited by the binder-type particles.
Further, optimum resistivities are present depending
on developing systems using them. For this reason, it
has been frequently practiced to use such carrier
particles as magnetic core particles and coating the
core particles with various resins to adjust the
resistivity.In recent years, the electrophotography is
widely adopted in copying machines and printers which
are required to comply with various types of images
including thin lines, small characters, photographic
images and color originals. There are also demands
for higher image quality, higher image speed and
continuous image forming performances, and these
demands are becoming more and more intense.As carrier particles for complying with such
demands, light-weight composite particles having a
specific gravity of 2 - 4 have been widely used so as
not to break the toner even under high-speed and
continuous image formation. There is an incessant demand for carrier
particles having further improved performances, and
