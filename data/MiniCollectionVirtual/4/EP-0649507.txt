<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and device for draining a liquid lubricant from a bearing arrangement for a shaft (2) rotating about an axis (1), said bearing arrangement having a bearing (3), especially a plain bearing, supporting the shaft (2) and to which lubricant is fed, and at least one adjacent sealing arrangement. The sealing arrangement has a seal (4) surrounding the shaft (2) and a collector chamber (5) surrounding the shaft (2) between the seal (4) and the bearing (3). The lubricant enters this collector chamber (5) along the shaft and out of the bearing and is drained therefrom. According to the invention, the lubricant which is moved about in the collector chamber (5) from the shaft (2) around the axis (1) is collected by suitable means (8, 9) in the collector chamber (5) and discharged without any significant loss of speed. Thus use is made of the conveying effect of the rotating shaft (2) to remove the lubricant from the bearing arrangement.

Device for the removal of a liquid lubricant from 
a bearing arrangement for a shaft (2) rotating about an 

axis (1), which bearing arrangement has a bearing (3), 
which supports the shaft (2) and to which the lubricant 

is admitted, and at least one sealing arrangement (4, 5) 
adjacent to the said bearing (3), which sealing arrangement 

has a seal (4) surrounding the shaft (2) and a 
collecting space (5), which is located between the said 

seal (4) and the bearing (3) and surrounds the shaft (2), 
into which collecting space (5) the lubricant enters 

along the shaft (2) from the bearing (3) and from which 
the lubricant is led away through a drain conduit (7), 

characterised by a funnel (8), which protrudes into the 
collecting space (5), for catching the lubricant and 

leading the lubricant into the drain conduit (7). 
Device according to Claim 1, in which the funnel 
(8) is arranged in the immediate vicinity of the shaft 

(2). 
Device for the removal of a liquid lubricant from 
a bearing arrangement for a shaft (2) rotating about an 

axis (1), which bearing arrangement has a bearing (3), 
which supports the shaft (2) and to which the lubricant 

is admitted, and at least one sealing arrangement (4, 5) 
adjacent to the said bearing (3), which sealing arrangement 

has a seal (4) surrounding the shaft (2) and a 
collecting space (5), which is located between the said 

seal (4) and the bearing (3) and surrounds the shaft (2), 
into which collecting space (5) the lubricant enters 

along the shaft (2) from the bearing (3) and from which 
the lubricant is led away through a drain conduit (7),  

 
in particular according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 

that the collecting space (5) has a wall (9) which is 
approximately straight relative to the axis (1) which has, at 

right angles to the axis (1), a cross-section which is 
formed by at least one spiral section (10) passing round 

the axis (1) and an intermediate section (11) closing the 
wall (9), and the drain conduit (7) opens into the wall 

(9) in the region of the intermediate section (11). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
in which the drain conduit (7) is directed approximately 

vertically. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
in which an injection conduit (6) for the removal of the 

lubricant is connected to the collecting space (5), which 
injection conduit (6), together with the drain conduit 

(7), represents a jet pump (6, 7) with the injection 
conduit (6) as the driving medium conduit. 
Device according to Claim 5, in which a first 
suction conduit (13) is connected to the drain conduit 

(7), which first suction conduit communicates with the 
seal (4) in order to extract a fluid, in particular 

lubricant, steam, water or air. 
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, in which a 
second suction conduit (14) is connected to the drain 

conduit (7), which second suction conduit communicates 
with the collecting space (5) in order to extract a 

fluid, in particular lubricant, steam, water or air. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
which is associated with a bearing arrangement in a 

turbine installation, in particular a steam turbine 
installation. 
Device according to Claim 8, in which the bearing 
arrangement is an end journal bearing (16) arranged in a 

steam space (15) of the turbine installation. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
in which the bearing (3) is a sliding bearing (3).
