<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a movable type staircase which 
serves as an auto safety ladder for people to escape in case of fire, 

particularly denotes the one which is set at the exterior wall or 
veranda at various floor levels of a building used as a veranda or 

staircase in normal times. On emergency, a safety bar (3) which is set 
beforehand in each floor of a building can be pushed aside to enable the 

movable staircase (1) to unfold itself and connect rapidly by its own 
gravity with the veranda or fire exit at the lower floor level, and also 

by means of the impassive force produced when the movable staircase is 
being lowered, the safety bar at the next lower floor level will be 

further pushed aside to again enable the movable staircase to unfold 
itself and connect rapidly by its own gravity with another still lower 

floor level and so on, until the various floor levels which are lower 
than the floor which the user is staying can be connected automatically 

in a similar way as that which occurs to indoor staircase. It is a 
staircase which provides a highly safe and automatic means of excape for 

people at the time of emergency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a movable type 
staircase, particularly denotes the one which is set at 
the exterior wall or veranda at various floor levels of 
a building to be used as a veranda or staircase in normal 
times. On emergency, its safety bar on any floor 
may be pushed aside to enable the movable staircase to 
unfold itself and connect rapidly by its own gravity 
with the veranda or fire exit at the lower floor level, 
and also by means of the impacsive force produced when 
the movable type staircase is being lowered, the safety 
bar at the next lower floor level will be further pushed 
aside to again eanble the movable staircase to unfold 
itself and connect by its own gravity rapidly with still 
another lower floor level and so on until the various  
 
floor levels which are lower than the floor which the 
user is staying can be connected automatically in a 
similar way as that which occurs to indoor staircase. 
It is a staircase which provides a highly safe and 
automatic means of escape for people at the time of 
emergency. With the development of modern technology, high-storeyed 
buildings are erected to provide people with 
a more comfortable living environment. Various new 
model of life-saving apparatus are available to cope 
with and satisfy new requirements derived from the 
modern life style in high-storeyed buildings, among 
which a suspension type of slow descending life saving 
equipment is very popular and marketable. It comprises 
of three gears, one gear ring and other assembling 
members. It is made of a centrifugal structure with 
the application of centrifugal theory, and resistance 
will be produced by the gears in coordination with 
the gear ring and the other assembling members to 
reduce the descending speed of people being suspended 
on it, so as to achieve the object of saving their own  
 
life. However, in spite of providing people with a 
light and convenient means of escape, such suspension 
life-saving equipment will make people face danger and 
feel afraid when they are being suspended on a steel 
wire facing the exterior wall of a tall building. Its 
capacity is also found to be extremely small due to 
its limitation of alllowing one person to escape at 
a time. Focussing on the defects of a suspension type slow 
descending life saving equipment described above, the 
inventor devoted himself to years of research and study 
for necessary renovation, and managed to overcome the 
aforesaid defects with the present invention hereof. In the "Auto Life-Saving

<CLAIMS>
An auto safety ladder which serves as a means of 
escape in case of fire, comprising of a movable 

ladder, a rewinding mechanism and a safety bar is 
set on the aperture of the exit veranda or aperture 

of existing veranda on the exterior wall of a building, 
of which the movabel ladder is one which be 

folded and unfolded, and is fixed to the 1st of the 
two guard-railings in front of the aperture of the 

exit veranda, with both guardboards and footboards 
set in between the gaurd-railings to serve as a 

means of connecting the two guar-railings and also 
serving as a staircase when the movavble ladder is 

unfolded in case of emergency; the rewinding mechanism 
comprises of a rewinding wheel which wound round 

the steel wire on the two gaurd-railings, an idle 
wheel and a reduced motor and is set on the lateral 

wall of the wexid veranda or at at any place which 
is convenient; and the idle wheel is set within the 

sliding hole of a fixed plate with its fixed position 
adjsutable within the aforesaid sliding hole to 

 
to adjsut its fixed position to the position lying 

between the speed reduced motor and the rewinding 
wheel, so as to further achieve the object of rewinding 

and folding the movable ladder electrically or 
move it for making direct engagement with the gear of 

the rewinding wheel, so as to achieve the object of 
folding the movable ladder manually or move it for 

making direct engagement with the rotating wheel of 
the speed reduced motor for recovery of its normal 

position upon completion of folding the movable ladder; 
at this time, by insertion of the extreme end 

of the saftey bar which is set in the exit veranda 
into the circular wheel aperture which is fixed at 

another end of the rewinding wheel, the movable 
ladder which is folded will be fixed; by means of 

the design of this safety bar, the movable ladder 
will, after the safety bar has been pushed aside, 

be enabled to drop downward and unfold itself with 
its own gravity until it reaches the exit vernada at 

the lower floor level and, at the same, pushes the 
safety bar of that floor aside, so as to enable the 

 
the movable ladder of that floor level to also drop 

downward and unfold itself with its own gravity and 
further connect with and push the safety bar aside at 

a still lower floor level; when this movement is being 
repeated floor after floor, the staircases of the 

various floor level lower than the floor level on 
which the people who are staying will be automatically 

be connected as though they were indoor staircase 
for safe escape. 
The auto safety ladder as described under Claim 1, 
in which the steel wire is connected to the top end 

of various horizontal connecting lever when the saftty 
ladder is unfolded, and wound round and pass the 

sliding wheel on the top end of the 1st rail lever 
and the two units of sliding wheel at the bottom side 

of the exit veranda until it reaches and wind round 
the rewinding wheel; therefore, besides serving as a 

handrail of the two guard-railings when the safety 
ladder is unfolded, the aforesaid steel wire can also 

serve as the medium when the safety ladder is being 
rewound and unfolded by the rewinding mechanism. 
The auto safety ladder as described under Claim 1, 
in which the last footboard of the movable ladder 

is much longer than the other footboards to serve 
is the door board to be located at the aperture of 

the exit veranda when the movable ladder is being 
unfolded. 
The safety ladder as described under Claim 1, in 
which a fixed block is set on the board for fixing 

the idle wheel on a position where the gear of the 
rewinding wheel is located to get it in touch with 

a ratchet claw and a single-direction ratchet claw 
which comprises of compressing springs, so that 

when the safety ladder is being folded manually 

the idle wheel will be caused to move to and get 
in direct engagement with the gear of the rewinding 

wheel and, at the same time, to cause the idle 
wheel to be squeeze against by the single-direction 

ratchet claw, so that the idle wheel can only rotate 
in one single direction, and thuis facilitate the 

operation of folding the movable ladder manually.
