<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a balanced phase modulator
used in the microwave band (1 to 100 [GHz]).US-A-4,355,289 relates to a phase shift and amplitude
modulator. The modulation circuit comprises a transformer,
two diodes which are connected to the transformer and a
bias circuit for applying bias voltages to the two diodes.Conventionally, a phase modulator for a microwave band
of 1 to 100 [GHz] has a circuit configuration as shown in
Fig. 4, for example. In this figure, a modulation signal
terminal 19 is provided by connecting diodes 20 and 20'
to a branch line 3 [dB] hybrid 21 equipped with an input
terminal 22 and an output terminal 23. In this phase
modulator, a microwave signal entering from the input
terminal 22 enters the branch line 3 [dB] hybrid 21 to be
subjected to modulation by the diodes 20 and 20'.
Ordinarily, Schottky barrier diodes are used for the
diodes 20 and 20'. Such a conventional phase modulator
is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application
No. 57-155865 (published September 27, 1982). Figure 5 is a diagram showing the modulation
characteristic of the phase modulator of Fig. 4 in terms
of the relation between the modulation voltage Vm and the
output signal voltage Vout. If this phase modulator
is used in the range of small values of the modulation
voltage Vm, then it operates as a linear modulator
according to the modulation characteristic. In the conventional phase modulator shown in Fig. 4,
therefore, there is a drawback that a signal loss becomes
significant because it must be used in the range where
the modulation voltage is small. In addition, the maximum
input power for the modulator is a low value of +10 [dBm]
because of the use of Schottky barrier diodes for the
diodes in the circuit, and its output power reaches
the order of -5 [dBm]. Accordingly, it is necessary to
increase the number of stages of amplification in order
to obtain a desired output power. However, such an
increase in the number of amplification stages brings
about a complication of the circuit configuration, and
high cost. Moreover, there is a problem in that the
output power level is too low and it is difficult to
maintain a circuit impedance as a whole at a constant
level. The Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No.
57-155865 also shows another circuit configuration which
includes an input terminal 24, an output terminal 25,
a coplanar converter 26, a slot line 27, DC cutting
capacitors 28, PIN diodes 29 and 29', a modulation signal-and-fixed
bias input terminal 30 and a fixed bias input
terminal
