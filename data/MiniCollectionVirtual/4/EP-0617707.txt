<ABSTRACT>
A method for insolubilizing films of N-carboxyalkyl derivatives of chitosan uses an annealing process to provide materials which can have varied degradation times. These materials can be used for various biomedical applications such as adhesion prevention. The annealing process heats the film for predetermined times at predetermined temperatures to vary the solubility of the film.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR INSOLUBILIZING N-CARBOXYALKYL DERIVATIVES OF CHITOSANBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method of temporariiy insolubilizing films and gels of N-carboxyalkyl derivatives of chitosan to provide materials which can have varied degradation times for various biomedical applications such as adhesion prevention. More particularly, the method relates to an annealing process in which the material is insoiubilized by exposing film to temperatures between 50°C and 200°C for various lengths of time.Description of the Prior ArtChitin and chitosan (partially deacetylated chitin) are well known biocompatible materials whose preparation has been described in U.S. Patent 2,040,880, which issued on May 19, 1936. A derivative of chitosan, N,O- carboxymethyl chitosan, and its production has been described in U.S. Patent 4,619,995, which issued to E.R. Hayes in October of 1986. The preparation of another chitosan derivative, N-carboxybutyl chitosan, is described in U.S. Patent 4,835,265.The uses of chitin, chitosan, and other polysaccharides in biomedical appli- cations is most evident in wound dressings. Materials for use in wound dressing applications are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,632,754, 4,532,134, 4,659,700, 4,572,906, 4,378,017, foreign patents GB 2026516, EP 0200574 and publications WO 86/00912 and WO 87/07618. Others have addressed the problem of adhesion prevention utilizing biodegradable materials. U.S. Patent 4,603,695, which issued August 5, 1986 to Ikada et al, discloses the use of an absorbable polyester polymer. Chitin and Chitosan can be absorbed by hydrolysis /π vivo.Co-pending application Serial No. 07/644,758, filed on January 24, 1991 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, teaches the use of chitosan and derivatives thereof for adhesion prevention. The teachings of this application are incorporated herein by reference. None of these patents or patent applications, 

 however, teach a simple way of insolubilizing films and gels from derivatives of chitin 

 for internal application to vary degradation times.As described in co-pending application Serial No. 07/644,758, scar tissue results from the organization of fibrinous exudate on tissue surfaces due to the infliction of trauma or inflammation. Vital tissues such as blood vessels, or organs including the kidney, liver, and intestines are coated with mucous or serous membranes so that they can function independently of each other. Examples of the mucous or serous membranes
