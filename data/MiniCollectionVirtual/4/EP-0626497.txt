<ABSTRACT>
Door stop having an elongate shaft (11) which can be rotated and displaced in a receiving means (12) arranged, in the floor (14), in the vicinity of a door (16). The shaft (11) projects vertically upwards out of the receiving means (12) and exhibits, at its projecting end (26), a transverse support (23) which extends from the shaft on both sides. When the door is opened, it comes to butt against the transverse support (23), with the result that the entire door stop rotates in the receiving means (12) and passes into two-dimensional abutment with the door (16). Further opening of the door after abutment on the door stop is thus prevented. In a preferred configuration, the transverse support (23) has projecting end pieces (47, 48). If the stop is inserted into the receiving means such that the end pieces jut out in the direction of the door, opening of the door is prevented completely. If the stop is inserted into the receiving means such that it is rotated through 180@, it functions as described above. On the door (16) there is expediently arranged a rigid stop plate (38) which distributes the contact-pressure force between door and stop uniformly over a large surface area.
