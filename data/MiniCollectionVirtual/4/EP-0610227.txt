<ABSTRACT>
A dental floss device (1, 40, 50, 60, 70) comprises a handle (2) having a shank (3) terminating in a head piece (4). A disposable dental floss holder (5) comprises a base portion (10) and a pair of spaced-apart jaws (11, 12) with a length of dental floss (13) extending therebetween. The head piece (4) has a groove (20) in which the base portion (10) is securely retained when the device is used in all flossing directions. Snap-fit projections (15) extend inwardly from the jaws (11, 12) of the floss holder (5) and are retained behing marginal edges (25) of a floor (24) of the groove (20). When used, the floss holder (5) is removed and a new floss holder (5) is fitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dental floss device of the type 
comprising:- 
   a handle having a head piece; 
   a disposable dental floss holder for interengagement 
with the head piece, on assembly; 
   the dental floss holder comprising a base portion and 
a pair of spaced-apart jaws extending from the base 
portion to accommodate a length of dental floss 
therebetween; and 
   releasable engagement means between the head piece of 
the handle and the dental floss holder. A dental floss device of this type is described in US 
3,892,249. The device described in this prior 
specification comprises a handle having a curved head 
piece with in-turned jaws which have formations which 
interengage with complementary formations on a dental 
floss holder. The holder is of flexible material and is 
bowed for fitting to the jaws of the head piece and thumb 
pressure applied.  
 One of the problems with known dental floss devices of 
this type is that the dental floss holder may be difficult 
to engage and disengage with the head piece. There is 
also a substantial risk of the dental floss holder 
becoming detached from the head piece in use in the mouth. This invention is directed towards providing a dental 
floss device which will overcome at least some of the 
problems with known devices. This invention is characterised in that:- 
   the releasable engagement means includes a transversely 
extending groove in the head piece of the handle or the 
base portion of the dental floss holder and a 
complementary tongue portion on the other of the base 
portion or head piece, the tongue portion engaging with 
the transverse groove, on assembly, 
   the releasable engagement means also including snap 
fitting means comprising snap fit projections on the 
jaws of the dental floss holder or the head piece the 
projections snap fittingly engaging on engagement of 
the tongue portion with the transverse groove to retain 
the dental floss holder securely in position on the 
head piece of the handle during movement of the holder 
in use in the mesio-distal, bucco-lingual and 
gingivoincisal directions.  
 The advantage of this arrangement is in ensuring that the 
device may be effectively and safely used in all 
directions of operation in use. The distal-medial 
direction refers to the direction across the face of a 
tooth in a substantially horizontal plane. The bucco-lingual 
direction refers to the movement interproximally 
in a substantially horizontal plane. The gingivo-incisal 
motion refers to the flossing motion in a

interengagement with the head piece (4), on 
assembly;
 
   the dental floss holder (5) comprising a base 

portion (10) and a pair of spaced-apart jaws 
(11,12) extending from the base portion (10) to 

accommodate a length of dental floss (13) 
therebetween; and
 
   releasable engagement means between the head piece
