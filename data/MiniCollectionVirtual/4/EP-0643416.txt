<ABSTRACT>
The electrode 
for a ceramic cathode 

fluorescent discharge 
ensures a high density 

of electron current, has 
a high resistance against 

heat shock, and is less 
damaged by sputtering. 

The diameter of a tube 
using this electrode can be 

small. The material for the 
electrode is prepared using 

0.5 to 1.5 mol of a first 
component selected from 

BaO, CaO or SrO, 0.05 
to 0.95 mol of a second 

component selected from 
ZrO₂ or TiO₂, and 0.025 

to 0.475 mol of a third 
component selected from V₂O₅, Nb₂O₅, Ta₂O₅, Sc₂O₃, Y₂O₃, La₂O₃, Dy₂O₃, Ho₂O₃, or 0.05 to 0.95 mol of the same 

selected from HfO₂, CrO₃, MoO₃, WO₃. Also, the electrode is fabricated by granulating this material and putting the 
lump, granular, or porous material in a bottomed cylindrical semiconductor magnetic container, and then, burning 

and reducing it. The mercury dispenser of the ceramic cathode fluorescent discharge lamp using this electrode is 
arranged in series between the bottomed semiconductor magnetic cylinder and the lead out section of the lead wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrode 
for a back-light discharge lamp used in a liquid crystal 
display unit for portable personal computer or word-processor. With the rapid progress and propagation of personal 
computers in recent years, compact size personal computers 
or word-processors of portable type are now rapidly and 
widely propagated. In particular, the so-called note type 
personal computer having the same external dimension of A4 
size as business papers and documents generally used has 
much popularity because it is compact, light-weight and low-priced. For the note type personal computer, liquid crystal 
display unit is used for display purpose in most cases. 
Since the liquid crystal display unit is not a light emitting 
display unit, a light source is needed to clearly  
 
display the content of display. An external light source is 
used as the simplest type of light source, but an internal 
light source is needed when the computer is used at a place 
without enough external light source or when sufficient 
light is required for color display. This internal light 
source is called backlight light source because light is 
irradiated from backside of the liquid crystal display unit, 
and it must be a planar light source so that the entire 
liquid display screen can be displayed. For this reason, 
a fluorescent discharge lamp combined with an electroluminescent 
(EL) element or a lightguide plate is used as 
the backlight light source. Fig. 1 shows an arrangement of a backlight light source 
using a fluorescent discharge lamp. In this figure, 
reference numeral 1 represents a light guide plate made of 
a light transmitting material such as glass or acrylic 
resin, and its surface is provided with irregularities to 
irradiate the light, which enters from the side of the 
plate, toward plane direction. On both sides of the light 
guide plate 1, fluorescent discharge lamps 2, 2 are mounted 
as light sources to irradiate light beams to the light guide 
plate 1. In a discharge lamp commonly used, gas for electric 
discharge is sealed in a tube, which is formed by a 
transparent material such as glass, and by applying AC or DC  
 
voltage on discharge electrodes arranged face-to-face in the 
glass tube, electric discharge occurs via the gas for 
electric discharge, and light is irradiated to outside. In case of the fluorescent discharge lamp, low pressure 
(about 1 Pa) mercury (Hg) gas is used as the gas for 
electric discharge. Ultraviolet ray with wave length of 
253.7 nm emitted from
