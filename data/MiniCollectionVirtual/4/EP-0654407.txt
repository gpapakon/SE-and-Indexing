<ABSTRACT>
The upper preparation surface (13) of a machine 
for packing superimposed layers of rolls (1) is removed, 

and that end part (108) of the conveyor (10) which used 
to oscillate and feed the rolls is stopped level with the 

lower preparation surface (12) and is now used as a 
supporting surface over which is positioned the lower 

part of a battery of curved channels (20) whose upper 
mouth is level with a conveyor (19) that feeds the large 

rolls (101) arriving with horizontal axes from the 
conveying line (2) that used to serve the now inactive 

parts of the machine and that has now been raised. The 
large rolls, which are stood vertically in the lower end 

part of the curved guiding channels, are cyclically 
transferred to the preparation surface (12) by a pusher 

(21) activated with a rectilinear reciprocating motion in 
phase with the machine cycle and at a frequency that can 

be varied. The sets of large rolls fed onto the preparation 
surface (12) are carried away in phase by the cross 

pieces (14, 15) of the synchronized conveyors (16, 17) 
and transferred to the lift (18) which then introduces 

them into the packing station.

<DESCRIPTION>
Machines for packing sets consisting of superimposed 
layers of products such as, for example, rolls of paper, 
boxes and the like, coming side by side from a single 
feeding line, are known. Machines of this kind are disclosed 
in, for example, US Patent No. 3 455 085 (corresponding to 
Italian Patent No. 1 225 033) to which documents full 
reference is made. These machines can also, if necessary, 
pack a set consisting of a single layer of products, but on 
the condition that these are not very tall, because the 
pushing action applied by the cross pieces of the conveyors 
to very tall products would be unbalanced and would lead to 
such products' falling over. Machines of known kind are able 
for example to pack sets consisting of a plurality of 
superimposed layers or of a single layer of rolls of toilet 
paper, but are incapable of packing a layer of large rolls 
of kitchen paper or other similar products. Prior art document DE-A-2 852 741 discloses a machine 
for packing products such as rolls of paper for domestic 
use, in which the rolls are orientated from a horizontal 
position to a vertical position for being packed, by means 
of curved guide channels. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
combined machine 
according to claim 1, 
whose features and advantages will appear 
clearly in the following description of a preferred 
embodiment illustrated in the figures of the accompanying 
sheets of drawings, in which:  
 
Fig. 1 diagrammatically illustrates the machine in the 
setup for packing rolls of toilet paper; Fig. 2 illustrates the machine in the setup for 
packing large rolls of kitchen paper or the like; Figs. 3 and 4 diagrammatically illustrate the packs 
produced by the machines shown in Figures 1 and 2  
 
respectively; and Fig. 5 is an enlarged lateral view of the 
movable end part of the machine which enables large rolls 
of paper to be packed. With reference initially to Figure 1, it can be 
seen that the machine for packing one or more superimposed 
layers of rolls 1 of toilet paper comprises a 
conveyor 2 on which these rolls travel in single file and 
in a plurality of parallel lines in the direction indicated 
by the arrow 3. The axes of the rolls may be 
horizontal or vertical. In the example illustrated, it is 
assumed that the axes of the rolls are horizontal. From 
the conveyor 2 the rolls are fed to a conveyor 4 equipped 
at the end part with a surface 5 which cyclically oscillates 
about a transverse spindle 6 and which, when 
raised, stops the lines of

<CLAIMS>
A machine for packing articles such as small size or 
large size rolls of paper (1, 101) comprising a feeding line 

(2), a first conveyor (10) with pushing cross pieces (9), 
said first conveyor being provided with at least one 

pivoting end portion (108) which positions itself 
alternately against superimposed lower and upper stracking 

surfaces (12, 13), synchronized conveyors (16, 17) with 
pushing cross pieces (14, 15) being provided at the stacking 

surfaces for delivering the rolls onto a wrapping machine 
lifting platform (18)
 
characterized by the fact that
 
for use in connection with large size rolls (101), the 

upper stacking surface (13) is removable, the pivoting end 
portion (108) is lockable in alignment with the lower 

stacking surface (12) and over said locked pivoting end 
portion there is positionable the lower end part of a 

battery of upwardly-orientated adjacent curved guide 
channels (20) presenting an upper mouth which is level with 

a conveyor (19) for feeding into them large size rolls (101) 
arriving from the feeding line (2), while a pusher (21) is 

located in the lower part of said guide channels (20) and 
moves with a horizontal rectilinear reciprocating movement 

in order cyclically to transfer at least the lower roll from 
said guide channels onto the lower stacking table (12) where 

the cyclically formed sets of large rolls are carried off by 
the pushing cross pieces of the synchronized conveyors (16, 

17) which feed the said sets of large rolls onto the 
wrapping machine lifting platform (18).  

 
A machine according to Claim 1, in which the curved 
guide channels (20) that pick up the large rolls are mounted 

on a frame (22) supported, with the possibility of vertical 
movement, by a fixed frame (25), and screw and nut means 

(26, 28) are provided for moving said frame from the raised 
position of rest into the lowered working position; there 

being mounted on this frame the horizontal guides (30) 
carrying the pusher (21) which cyclically transfers the 

rolls from the guide channels to the surface (12) and which 
has a horizontal upper part (121) which, during the active 

stroke, supports the rolls located above that roll which is 
being transferred; said pusher being driven by the 

connection through a system of connecting rods and levers 
(32, 33) to an adjustable-type motor unit (34). 
A machine according to claim 1, in which that portion 
of the conveyor (2) which feeds the rolls (1) to the first 

conveyor (10), is so designed that it can be raised and 
brought level with an inclined rising conveyor (19) which 

feeds the large rolls to the curved guide channels (20) when 
these channels are lowered into working position. 
A machine according to claim 2, in which at the 
bottom of the curved channels for guiding the large rolls, 

on the side from which these rolls exit, is an aperture for 
these products to pass through, said aperture being defined 

above by a cross piece (35) whose height can be adjusted as 
a function of the height of the large rolls using by 

suitable means of adjustment (36, 37, 38).  
 
A machine according to claim 1, comprising means 
(39), for immobilising, inside the curved channels through 

which the large rolls are guided, those rolls which are 
positioned above the pusher (21), before the entire unit is 

raised into the rest position.
