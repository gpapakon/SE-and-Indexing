<ABSTRACT>
A tracking system (200) adapted to receive input 
imagery and provide standard television format video 

input signals in response thereto. The video input 
signals are processed (228) to provide intermediate 

analog and digital signals. The intermediate analog 
signals are further processed (239) to provide centroid 

tracking of a target. The intermediate digital signals 
are processed (236) to provide correlation tracking of 

the target. In a specific implementation, the standard 
television format video input signals are provided by a 

charge coupled device (214), a Vidicon camera, an 
infrared focal plane array, a Newvicon camera or other 

device which generates standard television format video 
signals. A video rotation circuit may be used to provide 

proper image orientation regardless of the mounting 
orientation of the system. The invention provides a 

tracking system which allows for the direct use of video 
signals from a camera or other signal by a digital 

processing system without the requirement for scan 
conversion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image processing 
systems. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to tracking systems. While the present invention is described herein with 
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular 
applications, it should be understood that the invention 
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in 
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will 
recognize additional modifications, applications, and 
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional 
fields in which the present invention would be of 
significant utility. Numerous missile tracking systems are known in the 
art including radar, infrared, television (TV) and laser 
based systems. For certain applications, a tracking 
based on the detection of visible is advantageous. 
Certain conventional video missile tracking systems, such 
as the AGM 65A and B trackers, utilize a Vidicon camera 
to provide video signals to an analog video tracking 
system. The analog tracking system processed the 
incoming video signals to provide missile guidance 
control signals and servo loop control signals for the  
 
camera. The use of a video camera allowed for a display of 
the camera output without further processing. The 
monitor allowed for a visual display of tracker 
performance. However, the analog processing of the video 
signals limited the ability of the system to keep pace 
with ever increasing performance requirements. Accordingly, an improved tracking system was 
designed which included an infrared sensor and a digital 
tracker. However, although this system provided robust 
processor performance, the output of the infrared sensor 
had to be scan converted in order to be processed and 
displayed. The scan conversion requirement added to the 
cost and limited the performance of the system. Thus, there has been a need in the art for a 
tracking system which allows for the direct use of video 
signals from a camera or other signal by a digital 
processing system without the requirement for scan 
conversion. There is a further need in the art for an 
inexpensive system for upgrading older analog video 
missile tracking systems with a digital signal processing 
capability. The need in the art is addressed by the present 
invention which provides a tracking system adapted to 
receive input imagery and provide standard television 
format video input signals in response thereto. The 
video input signals are processed to provide intermediate 
analog and digital signals. The intermediate analog
