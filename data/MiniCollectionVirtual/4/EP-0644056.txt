<ABSTRACT>
A printer is disclosed in which a printer body is connected 
to a carriage (30) via a cable (20). The carriage (30) is 

driven by electric power supplied through the cable (20), and 
signals are also transmitted between the printer body and the 

carriage (30) through the cable (20). The cable comprises 
a sheet-like substrate and a plurality of conductive strips 

which are formed on a sheet-like substrate and which extend 
in a longitudinal direction of the sheet-like substrate. The 

plurality of conductive strips includes at least one wide 
conductive strip for supplying the electric power and at 

least one narrow conductive strip for transmitting the 
signals. The wide and narrow conductive strips are arranged 

such that noise created by the electric power supplied by the 
wide conductive strip does not interfere with the signals 

transmitted in the narrow conductive strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carriage-connecting device in a
printer.In order to drive a carriage which supports a
printing head, a stepping motor is typically used. The
stepping motor drives the carriage by driving a belt coupled
to the carriage. However, even though a stepping motor can
accurately position the carriage, a stepping motor is
relatively expensive to manufacture.
On the other hand, a DC motor is a less expensive alternative
means which is suitable to drive the belt. In addition,
a DC motor is usually contained in a printer of a large scale
computer that prints a large amount of data in a short period
of time. However, unlike a stepping motor, a DC motor has a
rotary shaft which rotates at high speeds and provides a lot
of torque. Therefore, since the high speed rotary shaft of
the DC motor drives the belt, another device is needed to
determine the distance that the belt has moved. An encoder
is typically used to measure the distance moved by the belt
and outputs a signal which represents the measured distance. 
Subsequently, the output signal and a separate clock pulse
signal are utilized to synchronize the printing of the
printing head on the carriage. The encoder may be a rotary
encoder or a linear encoder, but, in order to print high
quality characters at high speeds, a linear encoder is used
in most instances.In order to supply the output signal of the linear
encoder from the carriage to the printer body, a flexible
pattern circuit (FPC) is employed. An FPC is basically a
flat cable constructed of a flexible substrate which contains
conductive patterns on its surface. In addition to
transmitting the output signal of the linear encoder, the FPC
also supplies current from the printer body to the printing
head in order to drive the printing head.Since detecting the position of the carriage on the
carriage drive shaft is essential to synchronize the
operation of the printing head, a circuit which
instantaneously calculates the position and the direction of
the movement of the carriage from the output signal of the
linear encoder is provided on the carriage. However, the
carriage of a printer thus constructed is bulky and
accordingly the carriage-driving device is bulky.FIG. 7 is an illustration of the waveforms of the
current supplied to the printing head and of the output
signals transmitted by the encoder. As shown by the
waveforms VA and VB, the encoder signals have a significant 
amount of noise at the rise and fall of the current IP that
is supplied to the printer head.FIG. 8 shows a
