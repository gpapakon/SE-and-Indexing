<DESCRIPTION>
The invention provides compounds of the general formula (I),

wherein R is hydrogen, benzyl or p-nitrobenzyl group, and n is 0,
and wherein R is aryl, aralkyl or alkyl group with C1 to C4 atoms,
and n is 1.The compound of the general formula (I), wherein R is hydrogen and
n is 0 (N-Methyl-3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine
hydrochloride; Fluoxetine) is used in medicine as a selective
inhibitor of serotonin uptake (Wong, D. T. et al., Drug Dev. Res.,
1985, 6,397) and in the treatment of depressions and various types
of psychical and metabolic disorders (Chovinard, G. A., Clin. J.
Psychiatry, 1985, 46, 32).Preparation of Fluoxetine is described in US-A-4,018,895,
4,194,009 and 4,314,081, GB-A-2,060,618, ES-A-556,009
and EP-A-0 380 924 and 0
391 070.According to the US pat. by bromination of 3-chloropropylbenzene
(II) with bromosuccinimide 1-bromine-3-chloropropylbenzene
(III) is prepared, which is then by the
reaction with p-trifluoromethylphenol converted to N-methyl-3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylchloride 
(IV), from
which fluoxetine (I) by the reaction with methylamine is obtained.Yields in the last two steps are moderate, irrespective of the mode
in which the process is carried out. Transformation of the compound
(IV) into Fluoxetine requires high reaction temperatures at which
several by-products are produced, which reduces the yield
significantly and creates a considerable problem in obtaining pure
product by crystallization.Significant difficulties also arise during the large scale production
which applies another described process involving N,N-dimethyl-3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine
(V) as an
intermediate, especially because of the use of cyanogen bromide as a
demethylation agent which is very dangerous under the production
conditions. Similarly yields at some steps of this process
according to the statements of EP-A-0 391 070 (A1) are very
low, approximately 20%.In the ES-A-556 009 N-acyl and N-alkylcarbalkoxy
derivatives of N-methyl-3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropylamine (VI) as
intermediates are used, which by the treatment with
methylsulfonylchloride are converted into the corresponding
methylsulfonyl derivative (VII). After the reaction VIII with p-trifluoromethylphenol
N-methyl-N-acyl-(i. e. alkylcarbalkoxy) -3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamines
(VIII) are
obtained, from which Fluoxetine (I) by acid hydrolysis is
prepared.This process is also rather inappropriate for preparation of
fluoxetine because it is quite certain that the preparation of
