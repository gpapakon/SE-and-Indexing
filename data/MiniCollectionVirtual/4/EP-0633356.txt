<CLAIMS>
Joint dowel (1), as a connector of expansion, cutting or moving 
or day joints, in particular for concrete ceilings or concrete surfaces, plasters or tile plasters, 


comprising a base element of round metal (3), in particular 
round steel, and a plastic sleeve (4), 
characterised in that
the plastic sleeve (4) is as a sealed unit longer in the axial direction and larger in diameter that the base element (3), and 
the plastic sleeve (4) comprises at least one crumple zone (5). 
Joint dowel according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 only 
one crumple zone (5) in the central area (M) on the joint dowel 

(1) is provided. 
Joint dowel according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
plastic sleeve (4) protrudes in its end areas to an identical 

extent (B) over the base element (3). 
Joint dowel according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
amount (B) is between 5mm and 20mm. 
Joint dowel according to one of the above Claims, 

characterized in that
 the base element (3) has a diameter 
between 5mm and 35mm and a length between 0.25 and 1 

metre. 
Joint dowel according to one of the above Claims, 

characterized in that
 the plastic sleeve (4) is sealed in a 
respective end region by a welding point (6). 
Joint dowel according to one of the above Claims, 

characterized in that
 the crumple zone (5) is formed by 
folding of the plastic sleeve (4).
