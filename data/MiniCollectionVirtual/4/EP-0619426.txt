<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion engines has a nozzle body (10) with a valve seat (18) arranged on the combustion-chamber side and an outward-opening valve needle (15) with a closing head (16) which has a closing cone (17) that interacts with the valve seat (18). Arranged in the closing head (16) is at least one outward-directed spray hole (25) which is supplied with fuel from a pressure chamber (21) via a feed passage (27). The feed passage is aligned axially with the spray hole and merges into the latter in a funnel shape. Its width D corresponds approximately to the length 1 of the spray hole. The spray hole and the feed passage extend at an obtuse angle a, matched to the combustion chamber, relative to the longitudinal axis of the closing head. The inlet of the feed passage is situated in an end of the closing head remote from the combustion-chamber end.

Fuel-injection nozzle for internal combustion
engines having a nozzle body (10) in which a fuel inlet

duct (37) is formed, and a valve seat (18) is formed at
the combustion-space end, and having a valve needle

(15) which is displaceable in the nozzle body (10), is
spring-loaded in the closing direction and has, at its

combustion-space end, a closing head (16), which
interacts with the valve seat (18) on the nozzle body

(10), opens outwardly, is guided in the nozzle body
(10) and in which at least one spray hole (25) which

can be activated as a function of the needle stroke and
one inflow duct (27) which connects said hole to the

fuel inlet duct (37) are arranged, the inflow duct (27)
having, in the closing head (16), a substantially

greater cross section than the spray hole (25) and
being aligned with its longitudinal extension

essentially coaxially with that of the spray hole (25),
characterized in that each spray hole (25) is assigned

a separate inflow duct (27).
Fuel-injection nozzle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the inlet-end opening (28) of the

inflow duct (27) which is inclined with respect to the
longitudinal axis of the valve needle (15) lies in the

end side, facing away from the combustion space, of the
closing head (16).
Fuel-injection nozzle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the junction (29) of the inflow 

duct (27) with the spray hole (25) is formed
continuously.
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a plurality of

inflow ducts (27) which do not intersect one another
are arranged in the closing head (16).
