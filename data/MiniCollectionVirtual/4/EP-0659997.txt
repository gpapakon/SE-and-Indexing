<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a liquid filter box (casing) for an engine, including a bowl (1) which is designed to accommodate a filter element (2) and which has an opening (3) allowing the said filter element to be replaced, the box further including a removable lid (4) for closing the said opening, axially clamping an annular seal (7) against the bowl. According to the invention, the box further includes a rotary clamping ring (9) which interacts with the bowl and the lid to urge the lid towards the bowl by a screwing effect, this box also including a retaining member (10) and toothing (11) which extends angularly, this retaining member and this toothing being secured in the case of one of them to the ring, and in the case of the other to the bowl or to the lid, the retaining member being urged elastically towards the toothing and being designed to engage in the said toothing in order to retain the said ring while it is not being subjected to a deliberately exerted torque.
