<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for
coloring hydrophobic materials in red containing
benzodifuranone compounds, and methods for coloring
hydrophobic materials using the same. In more detail the
present invention relates to a composition which contains a
red benzodifuranone compound and red azo compounds, and
aplications of said composition to the methods for coloring
hydrophobic materials.Various benzodifuranone compounds usable for
dyeing or printing hydrophobic fibers have been mentioned,
for example, in JP-A-60-152567 ("JP-A-" means Unexamined
Japanese Patent Application, i.e. KOKAI ), JP-A-52-109526,
JP-A-56-122869, JP-A-3-14876 and JP-A-3-72571, etc.In recent years, with a consumer's trend toward
higher grade clothing, disperse dyes, excellent in the
properties of dyeability and fastness, have been
increasingly desired. Under such circumstances, materials
consisting mainly of hydrophobic fibers dyed with disperse
dyes have come to be subjected to various after-finishing
treatments, such as softening, antistatic, feel-improving
finishing and the like, in order to impart added value to
the material. Since these after-finishings are, however,
carried out at high temperatures, the dyes in the mateials
tend to bleed so that the wet fastness properties and,
particularly, the washing fastness properties are 
deteriorated.So far, many compounds, mainly azo compounds, have
been proposed in order to develop a red disperse dye having
a good washing fastness property. Most of them have not
yet completely solved the problems of the deterioration in
washing fastness during after-finishing treatments.Many benzodifuranone compounds have been proposed
too. Though they are good in washing fastness, still
further improvements are desired in their dye
characteristics and other fastness properties.To solve these problems, the present inventors
have conducted extensive studies, and accomplished the
present invention.The present invention provides a composition
containing benzodifuranone compounds for coloring
hydrophobic mateials in red which comprises at least one
compound selected from the group of benzodifuranone
compounds represented by the formula (I)

wherein R1, represents a methylene group or a straight
chain or branched C2-6 alkylene group which may be
optionally substituted by a hydroxy, C1-4 alkoxy or C1-4
alkylcarbonyloxy group, Q represents a 5- or 6- membered 
saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic ring residue which
may optionally be substituted with various substituents set
out below; and
