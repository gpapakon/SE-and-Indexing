<ABSTRACT>
2. For keeping and dispensing hot beverages, insulating containers with a bag-like inner container are known. In a container of this type, the thermal insulation is to be improved. The insulating container is designed in multiple parts in a particular manner. A lower base (64) is provided to receive the inner container (11). Seated on the base (64) is a bell-like upper part (13) with an insulating insert (14) which has particularly good thermal insulating properties.

Apparatus for storing and dispensing hot or cold 
drinks, in particular coffee drinks, having the following 

features: 

a) arranged in an insulating container (10), which has 
an upper section (13) and a lower section (12), is 

an insulating insert (14) which is designed in the 
form of a hemisphere (part 67) in one region and is 

designed cylindrically (part 66) in an adjoining 
region, and is designed, in particular, as a hollow 

vacuum body made of glass or the like, 
b) a bag-like, sealed inner container (11) which 
consists of a thin, flexible and collapsible 

material which is intended for receiving liquid is 
arranged in an exchangeable manner in the insulating 

insert (14), 
c) for introducing and/or for removing the liquid, the 
inner container (11) has a tube piece (24) which 

runs out of the insulating container (10), 
 
characterized by the following features: 


d) the lower section (12) has a stand (52) and a base 
(64) for receiving the upper section (13) and the 

insulating insert arranged therein, 
e) the base (64) has a peripheral border (17) which is 
adapted to the internal diameter of the cylindrical 

part (66) and receives the downwardly open, cylindrical 
part of the insulating insert (14) such that 

a lower border region (18) of the insulating insert 
(14) rests against the border (17) of the base (64) 

in a positively locking and sealing manner,  
 
f) the base (64) has a duct (21) through which the tube 
piece (24) is routed. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the inner container (11) has a connection stub (23) 

for filling and emptying the inner container (11), in 
particular in conjunction with the tube piece (24), and 

in that the base (64) forms a bottom surface (16) with a 
depression (22) into which the connection stub (23) of 

the inner container (11) can be fitted. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the depression (22) is adjoined by the duct 

(21), the latter being routed through the base (64) and 
opening above a standing surface for a vessel for receiving 

a quantity of the drink, in the lower part (68) of 
the lower section (12), to be precise in the region of a 

lateral opening (53) of the lower section (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that at least the base 

(64), preferably the lower section (12) as a whole, is a 
moulding consisting of thermally insulating material, in 

particular of foam material (foamed plastic), preferably 
of polyurethane. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the insulating 

insert (14) of the upper section (13) is enclosed on the 
outside by thermally insulating material, in particular 

by foam material (foamed plastic), preferably 
polyurethane, which rests against the outside of the 

insulating insert (14), in particular such that the outer 
contour of the upper section (13) is produced from 

thermally insulating material and terminates flush with 
the outer contour of the base or of the lower section. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized by an air line (50) for 

admitting air to, and extracting it from, the upper 
section (13) in accordance with the filling level of the 

inner container (11), the air line (50) being routed 
through the base (64) vertically along an inner wall of 

the upper section (13) or of the insulating insert (14)  
 

as far as the upper region (part 67). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the 
further claims, characterized in that the base (64) has 

a member (26) for pinching the tube piece (24), in 
particular a manually actuable spring (31) with a spring 

clip (39) which can be moved transversely with respect to 
the tube piece (24), the tube piece (24) preferably being 

closed at all times by the spring (31), and it being 
possible for the spring clip (39) to be moved 

transversely with respect to the tube piece (24) in order 
to open the latter.
