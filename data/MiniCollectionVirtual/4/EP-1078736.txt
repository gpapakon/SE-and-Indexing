<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithographic printing
plate precursor, in particular, relates to a lithographic
printing plate precursor capable of plate-making by scanning
exposure based on digital signals, having high sensitivity, high
press life and high strength, and capable of providing printed
matters with no staining.A lithographic printing plate precursor capable of
forming an image by a heat source such as a heat-sensitive head,
etc., and a lithographic printing plate precursor capable of
forming an image by heat which is converted from irradiated light,
are known in the lithographic printing technique. In particular,
the latter lithographic printing plate precursor is promising as
the lithographic printing plate precursor for computer to plate
(CTP) technique capable of directly making a printing plate
without necessitating a film by scanning highly directional
active radiant rays such as laser rays in accordance with
digitized image data.As the support of a lithographic printing plate precursor
capable of forming an image by the work of heat (called heat-sensitive
type image recording), metals such as aluminum and
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are widely used. When metals are used as the support of a lithographic
printing plate precursor, since metals do not absorb water and
a solvent, moreover, are excellent in strength, even if water and
a solvent is used after that in a developing step, dimensional
accuracy of the support does not deteriorate and the recorded
image is correctly reproduced. Further, since metals are
fundamentally excellent in strength, the obtained lithographic
printing plate precursors have excellent press life in many cases.However, since metals have a high heat-conductivity,
even if it is tried to form an image by irradiation of light for
image-recording, e.g., laser rays, and converting the light to
heat, the heat is liable to be dissipated to a metal support and
a satisfactory image is difficult to be formed. That is, the
sensitivity of the lithographic printing plate precursor becomes
very low, and staining due to ink is generated on the non-image
area of a printed matter. Therefore, sufficient energy becomes
necessary to form an image, for instance, by raising light output
and delaying writing time, but if light output is increased, the
manufacturing cost of a writing unit increases, as a result, the
advantage of the manufacturers of the unit is lowered, and if
writing time is delayed, plate-making takes longer time, as a
result, the advantage of the printing
