<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating a mammal to inhibit the presence or the activity of H. pylori in the gastrointestinal tract is disclosed. The method encompasses orally administering to said mammal a sufficient amount of a scavenging, reacting or inactivating compound to remove bicarbonate ions, ammonium ions or urea which are present in combination with the microorganisms which colonize and infect the gastric mucosa. Such microorganisms have been implicated in gastritis, gastric ulcer disease and as a risk factor in gastric carcinoma. Also, the invention encompasses a method, utilizing these compounds, for the treatment or prevention of dermatitis, such as diaper rash resulting from exposure to urease, urea, ammonia and/or bicarbonate of urea and feces, wherein these compounds are applied to the skin or used to pretreat the diaper. Also included are compositions which are used for the methods described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Compositions for the treatment of pylori and dermatitis.This invention relates to a method and composition for the treatment of the presence or activity of urease- containing bacteria which are implicated in various ailments. The invention described herein also encompasses the amelioration, treatment or prevention of skin rash or dermatitis caused by urease-containing bacteria, bacterial components and by-products thereof.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMicrobial ureases are important enzymes in certain human and animal pathogenic states, in ruminant metabolism and in environmental transformation of certain nitrogenous compounds.Bacterial urease is implicated in the pathogenesis of many clinical conditions. It is directly associated with the formation of infection stones and contributes to the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis, ammonia encephalopathy, hepatic coma, urinary catheter encrustation and peptic ulceration. Bacterial urease in feces also plays a prominent role in diaper dermatitis (also known as diaper rash) . This invention attempts to ameliorate two of these conditions, namely; gastrointestinal diseases associated with Helicobacter pylori ("H. pylori " ) and diaper dermatitis.H . pylori is presently being studied and has been implicated in several gastrointestinal diseases. Formerly known as Ca pylobacter pylori or Pylordis, this organism was first isolated from humans in 1982. The Principals and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Update No. 9, pages 1-10 (1991), contains a cumulative description of the characteristics H . pylori , and its association with gastrointestinal disease. In 

particular, these organisms have been implicated in chronic diffuse and Type A gastritis, as well as gastric and duodenal ulcers.Since H . pylori is closely associated with chronic gastritis, which, in turn, is a well-known risk factor for the development of gastric carcinoma, it has been postulated that there is a role for this organism in the development of such carcinomas. A number of recently published studies appears to further confirm thatH.pylori is a risk factor in the development of gastric cancer. (Parsonnet, et al. New Eng. J. Med. , Oct. 1991: 1127-1131; Nomura, et al., New Eng. J. Med. f Oct. 1991: 1132-1136) .The organism has been isolated from the gastric environment, which is generally hostile to bacterial growth. It has been postulated that the organism colonizes the gastric mucosa and generates a protective layer, or sheath, which contains ammonia, which shields the microorganism from acid
