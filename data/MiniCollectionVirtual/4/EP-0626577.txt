<ABSTRACT>
A method of monitoring in-tank and on-line metal 
ion content within a plating bath. The method involves 

the steps of applying a pretreatment signal to a sensing 
electrode positioned within the plating bath, applying 

a sweep signal to the pretreated sensing electrode, and 
measuring the voltammetric peak current of the resultant 

response signal. The voltammetric peak currant is 
proportional to the metal ion content of the plating 

bath. The method complements and is easily integrated 
with known voltammetric techniques for analysis of trace 

and major constituents, and is thus an integral part of 
an efficient overall plating bath analysis system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to plating
baths and methods for monitoring the constituents
contained therein. More particularly, the method of the
present invention relates to a voltammetric analysis
method which accurately indicates metal ion
concentrations within the bath. The method can be used
to maintain desired metal ion concentrations in order to
ensure optimal plating bath performance.A typical plating bath solution is comprised of a
combination of several distinct electrochemical
constituents which can be broadly divided into major
constituents and trace constituents. The major
constituents typically make up about 2 to 30 percent of
the total bath weight or volume. Trace constituents are
present in smaller quantities, usually less than 1
percent of the total weight or volume. Metal ions are
the source of plated metal, and, therefore, are an
important type of major constituent found in all plating
baths.The concentration levels of both major and trace
constituents will influence the quality of the resultant
plating deposit, and should therefore be regularly
monitored. Methods have been developed for in-tank
monitoring of trace constituents as well as certain
major constituents. For example, U.S. Patent No.
4,631,116 discloses a method for monitoring trace
constituents such as organic addition agents using an
in-tank electrochemical sensor. The above patent is
owned by the same assignee as the present invention and
is hereby incorporated by reference. In general, the high concentrations of metal ions
in their respective plating baths can interfere with
voltammetric analysis and other wet chemical measurement
techniques. Therefore, a sample of the plating bath
solution is usually drawn from the plating tank and
diluted or added to a buffer solution prior to analysis
of metal ion concentration. Supporting electrolytes may
then be added to the diluted or buffered sample to
improve measurement accuracy. The sample can be either
manually or automatically drawn. (See EG&G Princeton
Applied Research, Application Note Plat-2, "Application
of Polarography to the Plating Industry," 1985 for
further detail.) US-A-478 6373 uses a similar voltammetric analysis method for analysing a liquid which further employs a pretreatment of the sensing electrode.The diluted sample is typically analyzed using
either wet chemical analysis or voltammetry. Linear
sweep voltammetry is one voltammetric technique which
may be used, typically in conjunction with a dropping
mercury electrode. The dropping mercury

A method of monitoring the concentration of
metal ions within a plating bath solution contained within a plating tank, said method

comprising the steps of:

applying at least one pretreatment signal having a potential and a duration to
a sensing electrode positioned within said plating bath

solution to remove contaminants from the sensing electrode producing a pretreated sensing electrode;
applying a sweep signal having a voltage range and a sweep rate to said pretreated
sensing electrode to thereby produce a response signal
