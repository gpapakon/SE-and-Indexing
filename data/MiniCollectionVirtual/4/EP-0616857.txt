<ABSTRACT>
In order that an apparatus for sorting objects, in particular objects of a sheet-like configuration, such as magazines, compact discs or the like, permits simple and horizontal distribution of the objects, while avoiding additional outlay, an endlessly circulating roller conveyor (2) is subdivided into roller portions (3.1, etc.) comprising groups of rollers (7.1.1, ... 7.1.n, 7.n.1, ... 7.n.n) with window portions (5.1, etc.) located therebetween as gaps. Secondary conveying devices (11.1, etc., 12.1, etc.) are arranged beneath the upper conveying plane (upper strand 2.1) and the lower return plane (lower strand 2.2), in the intermediate strand (2.3) of the roller conveyor (2). The secondary conveying devices (11.1, etc., 12.1, etc.) are assigned roll-off devices (6.1, etc.) which, activated by a control device, come into contact with the rollers (7.1.1, ... 7.1.n, 7.n.1, ... 7.n.n) of a roller portion (3.1, etc.), with the result that the object (4.1, etc.) located thereon rolls off counter to the conveying direction of the roller conveyor (2) and falls, through the window portion (5.1, etc.) located behind this, onto the secondary conveying device (11.1, etc., 12.1, etc.) located beneath said window portion (5.1, etc.). By virtue of this surface area/gap distribution, the objects (4.1, etc.) can fall immediately from the upper strand (2.1) onto the secondary conveying devices (11.1, etc., 12.1, etc.). The backwards rolling-off of the objects (4.1, etc.) into the gap formed as a window portion (5.1, etc.) ensures that the objects (4.1, etc.) are deposited virtually horizontally into the gap and onto the secondary conveying devices (11.1, etc., 12.1, etc.) located therebeneath in the intermediate strand (2.3).

Apparatus for distributing articles, more
particularly flat articles, such as magazines, compact

disks or the like, comprising

a conveyor means (2), which has gaps (5.1, ...)
and on which articles (4.1, ...) are to be placed,
sorting means (11.1, ..., 12.1, ...) which are
disposed beneath the gaps (5.1, ...) and
a control means which by reference to recognition
images causes the articles (4.1, ...) to be

distributed to one of the sorting means (11.1,
..., 12.1, ...),

characterised in that
the conveyor means is a roller conveyor (2)
circulating with an endless traction means and

divided into roller sections (3.1, ...) consisting
of rollers (7.1.1, ..., 7.1.n, ..., 7.n.1, ...,

7.n.n) disposed in groups with gaps therebetween
in the form of window sections (5.1, ...), and
in that the sorting means (11.1, ..., 12.1, ...)
have associated roll-off means (6.1, ...) which,

under the control of the control means, touch the
rollers (7.1.1, ..., 7.1.n, ... 7.n.1, ... 7.n.n)

of one of the roller sections (3.1, ...) so that
the article (4.1, ...) resting thereon rolls off

in opposition to the direction of conveyance of
the roller conveyor (2) and drops through the 

selected window section (5.1, ...) therebehind on
to the sorting means (11.1, ... 12.1, ...)

situated beneath this window section (5.1, ...).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in
that the roller conveyor (2) has a substantially

uniform speed of circulation.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the articles (4.1, ...) are placed on the

roller sections (3.1, ...).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the rollers (7.1.1, ... 7.1.n,

7.2.1, ... 7.2.n, ... 7.n.1, ... 7.n.n) disposed in
groups in the circulating roller conveyor (2) are held

on both sides side by side in chains, cables or the
like, the window sections (5.1, ...) being left free,

and are guided in substantially parallel upper and
lower pairs of guides (10.1.1, 10.1.2, 10.2.1, 10.2.2).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the rollers (7.1.1, ... 7.n.n)

consist of a rigid shaft permanently connected to the
chains, cables or the like and at least one hollow

cylinder movable freely and rotatable therearound.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the roll-off means (6.1, ...)

consist of a bar of substantially the length (13) of
the window section (5.1, ...).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the roll-off means (6.1, ...) are 

disposed in at least one of the outside zones of the
roller conveyor (2).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the sorting means consist of a

conveyor belt (11.1, ...) and at least one receiving
means (12.1, ...) disposed on one of the ends of the

conveyor belt (11.1, ...).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the conveyor belts (12.1, ...)

are disposed at an angle of between 10 to 170Â° offset
form the direction of movement of the circulating

roller conveyor (2) beneath the upper pair of guide
rails (10.1.1, 10.1.2).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the conveyor belts (12.1, ...)

are suspended at an angle to the horizontal from the
upper guide rail pair (10.1.1, 10.1.2)
.
