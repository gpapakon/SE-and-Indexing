<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for generating interrupt information 
includes an address generator (7) for generating specified 

address information for specifying desired information 
stored in a memory (4), a readout address generator (8) for 

generating readout address information of the desired 
information stored in the memory (4), and a comparator (9) 

for comparing the specified address information from the 
address generator (7) and the readout address information 

from the readout address generator (8) and for generating 
interrupt information in case of coincidence of the 

specified address information and the readout address 
information and supplying the interrupt information to a 

central processing unit (2). Since the interrupt data is 
supplied to the central processing unit (2) at the playback 

timing of desired data (e.g. desired sound source data), 
reproduction of the sound source data can be detected, so 

that it is unnecessary for the central processing unit to 
poll the address of the sound source data at all times and 

hence the load imposed on the central processing unit may 
be correspondingly decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sound
information processing apparatus which may, be
example, advantageously be employed in an electronic
musical instrument or a television game device.The sound sources employed in general in an electronic
musical instrument or a television game device may be
roughly classified into analog sound sources, such as a
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), a voltage-controlled
amplifier (VCA), a voltage-controlled filter (VCF) etc.,
and digital sound sources, such as a programmable sound
generator (PSG) or a zigzag readout type ROM.The above-mentioned sound source (sampler sound
source) stores only sound source data of a pre-set pitch
(interval) compressed by compression with, for example,
non-linear quantization. Each sound source data is stored
in two parts, that is in a formant portion (FR) and a
one-period portion (LP) of plural repeated constant period
waveforms following the formant portion, as shown in Fig.4.
The formant portion is a signal waveform at the initial
stage of sound production proper to each musical
instrument, such as an operating sound produced from when
a key of a keyboard is struck until a hammer hits the
string in the case of a piano. During readout of the sound
source data the formant portion is read out first and the 
one-period portion is read out a plurality of times.Since the above sound source data is compressed, and
only the required portions, that is the above formant
portion and the one-cycle repetitive portion, are extracted
and stored, a large quantity of sound source data may be
stored in a smaller storage area.As a general speech information processor for data
processing of the sampler sound source, there has been
proposed an audio processing unit (APU) 107 consisting of
a digital signal processing unit (DSP) 101, a memory 102
and a central processing unit (CPU) 103, as shown in Fig.5
of the accompanying drawings.In Fig. 5, the APU 107 is shown connected to a host
computer 104, provided in a customary personal computer, a
digital electronic musical instrument or a TV game device.The host computer 104 includes a ROM cassette storing
the above-mentioned sound source data, the control program
etc. The control program stored in the ROM cassette is read
out by the CPU 103 so as to be stored in a working memory
(RAM) 103a therein.The CPU 103 causes the sound source data to be read
out from the ROM cassette and transiently stored in the
memory 102, based upon the above-mentioned control program.
The CPU 103 also controls the DSP 101 responsive to
