<ABSTRACT>
A switch assembly of the type having a rocker actuator user rotatable in 
opposite directions from a neutral position for alternate actuation of individual 

switches on opposite sides of the rocker. The rocker has a plurality of 
arcuately spaced recesses which are resiliently engaged to detent the rocker in 

a neutral and an actuated position. In one embodiment, the recesses engage a 
resilient wire beam spring extending parallel to the rocker axis. In another 

embodiment, the recesses are formed on a portion of the rocker which 
resiliently deflects to permit engagement and disengagement with a stationary 

pivot surface. In another embodiment, recesses in the rocker are engaged by a 
detent surface provided on a stationary resiliently deflectable beam extending at 

right angles to the rocker axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to switches of the type having a user
manipulated actuator with a central unactuated position and an actuated
position on either side of the neutral or unactuated position. Switches of this
type are usually known as rocker switches, due to the rotational movement of
the user manipulated actuator from the neutral or unactuated to either of the
actuated positions. Where the user manipulated actuator has a portion
extending outwardly therefrom as a projection, switches are typically known as
paddle type rocker switches.Switches of the above-mentioned type have found widespread usage in
automotive applications where it is desired to provide the user with readily
discernible tactile feedback of the state of the switch actuator in order that the
vehicle operator may manually locate the switch and effect the desired
movement thereof without visual distraction from the primary function of
vehicle operation.In vehicle accessory control switch applications, it is often desirable to
provide an indication of a switch neutral or unactuated position; and, in some
cases it may be desirable to provide a detenting of the movement of the
actuator to provide the user with a discernable indication of the neutral or
unactuated position, and particularly in applications where the switch actuator
is movable in opposite directions of rotation. Where a switch is operated by bi-directional
rotation of an actuator member such as a rocker, for actuating a
plurality of stationary individual switching mechanisms, it has been difficult to
provide a tactiley discernable way or means of indicating the neutral or
unactuated position of the switch without substantially altering the effort
required to actuate or "feel" required to actuate the switch in either of the
opposing directions of movement. In rocker type switches employed for
automotive accessory controls, and particularly such switches manufactured in
high volume, it has proven extremely difficult to incorporate a positively
discernable neutral position indication in a switch without substantially 
increasing the cost of the switch to the extent which would render the switch
non-competitive in the marketplace for automotive applications. Thus, it has
long been desired to provide a way or means of detenting a rocker-actuated
switch where the switch is intended to be operated in opposite directions from
a central or neutral position, and to provide such an indication or feel of the
neutral position in a manner which is reliable and low in cost in high

<CLAIMS>
A switch assembly (10) comprising:

(a) housing means (12, 14);
(b) a rocker member (78) mounted for rotational movement in a clockwise
and anti-clockwise direction on said housing means (12, 14) and having

integrally formed therewith a user-movable portion (80) extending
externally of said housing means (12, 14) an including another portion

disposed interiorly of said housing means (12, 14) on the opposite side of
a pivotal mount from said user-movable portion (80), said another

portion defining a plurality of detent surfaces (94, 96, 98, 100) disposed in arcuately
spaced arrangement;
(c) a first and second switching means (26, 28) each having a contact member (40, 42) mounted on said
housing means (12) on opposite sides of said rocker pivotal mount and

operable for movement between an operating position and a reset
position; and,
(d) detent means (302, 402) comprising a portion of said housing means (14) and operable to
effect resiliently releasable engagement of said detent surfaces (94, 96, 98, 100) at a

neutral or centered position and upon said rotational movement of
said rocker member (78) in either of said opposite directions at a position

causing said movement of, respectively, one of said switching
means (26, 28); wherein, said rocker member (78) is operative upon

user movement in said directions to alternately effect said
movement of said first and second switching means (26, 28).
The switch assembly (10) defined in claim 1, wherein said detent means (402) comprise
a resiliently deflectable portion (404) of said housing means (14, 314).
The switch assembly (10) defined in claim 1, wherein said rocker member (78)
includes a generally arcuately shaped resiliently deformable portion (292)

defining said detent surfaces (294, 296, 298).
The switch assembly (10) defined in claim 1, further comprising a plurality of
individual actuator members (54, 56) mounted for movement on said housing

means (12, 14), each responsive to said rotational movement of said rocker
member (78) in one of said clockwise and anti-clockwise directions.
The switch assembly (10) defined in claim 1, wherein said rocker member (78) is formed
integrally of thermoplastic material.
