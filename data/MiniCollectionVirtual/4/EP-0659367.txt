<ABSTRACT>
In a household appliance for mounting in a kitchen unit (10) with a plinth set back with respect to the front of the kitchen and with a recess for inserting the appliance, the housing of which likewise has a plinth (22) which serves to receive appliance aggregates (sets of appliances) or the like and is equipped with air ducts which serve for ventilation of the appliance aggregates and emerge from and enter the plinth of the appliance, in a plane parallel to the opening plane of the recess, through openings which are covered by a ventilation grille (33) capable of being adapted to the set-back plinth of the adjacent pieces of kitchen furniture, the ventilation grille (33) is adjustable, for the purpose of its adaptation, in terms of guidance, in a substantially continuously displaceable manner on mutually adjoining supporting elements formed, with respect to the guiding length, partly by the appliance plinth and partly by the recess, the two parts having a step relative to one another.

<CLAIMS>
Household appliance (21) for incorporation into a kitchen unit row 
(10) with a pedestal (16) set back relative to the kitchen unit front and 

with a niche for insertion of the appliance (21), the housing of which 
similarly has a pedestal (22) which serves for reception of appliance 

units or the like and which is equipped with air guide channels, which 
serve for the ventilation of the appliance units and which in the 

pedestal (22) of the appliance (21) exit or enter in a plane parallel 
to the opening plane of the niche by way of openings, which are covered by 

a ventilation grating (33) matchable to the set-back pedestal of the 
adjacent kitchen furniture, characterised thereby that the ventilation 

grating (33) for its matching is displaceable in guided manner on support 
elements which substantially adjoin one another and which with respect to 

guide length are formed partly by the apparatus pedestal (22) and partly 
by the niche (18), wherein the two parts have a step relative to one 

another. 
Household appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the support elements at the pedestal of the appliance (21) are formed by 

horizontally extending support surfaces (30) which are arranged in the 
proximity of the side surfaces thereof and face the front of the opening 

plane of the niche (18) and against which support webs (34) arranged at 
the lateral edge sections of the ventilation grating (33) are capable of 

displaceably bearing. 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that webs serving as slide skids (35) are arranged at the horizontal 

support webs (34) of the ventilation grating (33), engage in slotlike 
passages (32) arranged in displacement direction at the supports (30), 

and serve for support of the ventilation grating (33) on the part of the 
support elements formed by the niche (18). 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or 3, characterised thereby 
that the part of the support elements formed by the niche (18) is formed 

by striplike projections (20), which are arranged at the level of the 
transition of the appliance pedestal (22) to the appliance housing and  

 
project into the niche space and which serve as a slide path for the 

slide skids (35) arranged at the support webs (33a). 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby that in the displacement direction of the ventilation grating 

(33) away from the appliance housing the ventilation grating (33) is 
displaceably guided initially at the support elements of the appliance 

pedestal (22) and subsequently thereto at the support elements of the 
niche (18). 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
thereby that the ventilation grating (33) is fixable in displacement 

direction in the range of its displacement travel by a catch releasably 
arranged at the ventilation grating (33) at the front side and in the 

region outside the support elements formed by the support surfaces (30) 
and striplike projections (20). 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
thereby that the ventilation grating (33) has guide elements (39) between 

the catch, which guide elements engage over the entire adjustment travel 
of the ventilation grating (33) in a guide web (28) which ensures 

centralised association of the ventilation grating (33) with the 
appliance pedestal (22).
