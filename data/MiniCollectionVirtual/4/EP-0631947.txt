<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a containerization system suitable for containing 
water soluble or dispersible packages where the package is placed in a rigid 

outer 
container the inner dimensions (1,2,3) of which are equal to or smaller 

than the width 
perimeter and length perimeter of the bag (5) respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The inventor relates to a containerization system suitable for containing water 
soluble packages of Hazardous materials comprising a rigid packing container 
wherein the total width-length outer perimeter of the water soluble package is equal to 
or less than the corresponding inner width perimeter in the container into which it is 
placed. At the present the introduction of Hazardous materials such as agrochemicals 
especially in the form of gels in flexible water soluble packages has commenced. 
These are shown to be useful because they can be handled with relative ease without 
significant difficulties and without danger of contact with the bag's contents. In U.S. 
Patent 5,080,226 agrochemicals in water soluble bags are described. These are in the 
form of gels in flexible polymer water soluble bags. They represent an improvement 
over prior bags because of the improvements in the prevention of leakage and spilling 
in such bags during transportation, handling, and storage. While these bags represent 
a major step forward in the use of such containers, flexible containers are difficult to 
ship and are usually placed in a shipping container. Normally for shipments in a 
container, certain strength requirements must be met. U.S. Government regulations 
require that the drop and damage resistance of the contents in a shipping container 
must stop the product from leaving the shipping container, see Govt. Reg. 
49 C.F.R. 178.516, 49 C.F.R. 178.603, and the transport of dangerous goods 9.7.3. In  
 
addition the package must be subjected to such drop at 1.2 meters_-8Â°C because this 
condition could exist in the real world. The colder the ambient temperature is, the 
more brittle polymeric bags normally are and more difficult to perform the test 
successfully. Normally, rigid containers are used in shipping and handling of hazardous 
materials to allow shipment of multiple units and to give further protection to the 
contents. For example, corrugated boxes, normal design of such rigid containers is 
to design a cavity for placement of the contents where all three dimensions are 
slightly to greatly bigger than the contents to be shipped. Smaller containers, having 
one or more dimensions smaller than the contents, while more cost effective, are not 
used because of the difficulty of insertion, problems with fit, and the tendency of a 
smaller container to transmit more shock and in general be less protective than a 
larger container. It also can be a problem when placing the polymeric bags in a rigid
