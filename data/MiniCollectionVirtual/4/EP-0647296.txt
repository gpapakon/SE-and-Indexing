<ABSTRACT>
A roller-control unit for a continuously-variable-ratio transmission of the toroidal-race rolling-traction type, in which the roller carriage (10, 14) is connected by a pivotal joint (30) to the piston (15) of a hydraulic piston-and-cylinder unit (15, 16). The piston (15) is double-acting, and the piston/cylinder contact is the only locus through which the roller carriage (10, 14) makes contact with the fixed structure of the transmission. The piston (15) may have an inner part (32) to which the roller carriage (10, 14) is jointed, and a sleeve-like outer part (33, 34) which makes the necessary sliding and sealing contacts with the cylinder (16), but allows the roller carriage (10, 14) the necessary freedom of pivoting movement during use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to continuously-variable-ratio 
transmissions ("CVT's") of the toroidal-race rolling-traction 
type, and in particular to roller-control units of the kind by 
which the orientation of the traction-transmitting rollers may be 
controlled hydraulically, by means of the direct connection of 
the carriage of each roller to a piston, movable within a 
hydraulic cylinder connected to a controlled source of variable 
fluid pressure. Several patent publications of recent years, of 
which W090/05860 is an example, describe toroidal-race 
transmissions in which direct connection of each roller to a 
piston subject to controlled hydraulic pressure suffices to 
maintain the angular orientation of each roller - and thus the 
ratio transmitted by it from an input disc to an output disc - at 
the appropriate value at all times. The key to the efficacy of 
such an apparently simple method of roller control is that for 
any given combination of the essential parameters (operator 
demand, engine load and speed, final output speed etc.,) of the 
complete driveline of which the CVT is part, for each angular 
orientation that each roller may take up within its possible 
range of such orientations there will be a unique torque loading 
to which that roller will be subjected. A control system 
receives inputs representative of all the essential parameters, 
and sets up within the cylinder the appropriate hydraulic 
pressure to match the torque reaction associated with the desired 
orientation, so causing the roller to seek and hold that 
orientation. One of the problems encountered in practice by CVT's, in 
which the rollers are so controlled, is that whereas the centre 
of a simple piston executes a straight-line motion as that piston 
reciprocates within its cylinder, the motion required of the 
centre of a roller of a toroidal-race CVT, as that roller changes 
its orientation, is not straight-line. Instead, the roller  
 
centre must be able to travel a short distance back and forth 
along the circumference of the centre circle of the imaginary 
torus, to whose outline the surfaces of the co-operating races 
formed on the input and output discs must correspond. The roller 
centre must therefore move along an arc. To accommodate this, in 
most of the embodiments described in publication W090/05860 the 
sealing ring of the piston has a part-spherical outer face, 
allowing the piston to tilt slightly within the cylinder without 
losing sealing contact with it. Such a design, although 
practicable,

<CLAIMS>
A roller-control unit for a continuously-variable-ratio transmission of the toroidal-race 
rolling-traction type in which roller carriages (10) are connected to hydraulic piston-and-cylinder 

units by operation of which the orientation of the rollers (9) and thus the 
transmitted ratio is controlled, a said roller-control unit comprising a cylinder (16) 

mounted on fixed supporting structure (25b), a piston (15), and a connection 
member (14) between that piston and the carriage of the associated roller (9), in which 

the piston is constrained to move within the cylinder so that the axes of the cylinder (29) 
and piston are coincident at all times, and in which the piston and the connection member 

are connected by a pivotal joint (30, 31) located within the piston, 
characterised in that
 
the piston is double-acting, in that the cylinder is formed with an aperture (28), in that 

the piston carries a sleeve part (33) which makes a sealed fit within the aperture as the piston 
moves back and forth within the cylinder, and in that the interior of the sleeve provides 

the necessary clearance for the connection member as it pivots at the pivotal joint. 
A roller-control unit according to Claim 1 in which the pivotal joint is a ball joint. 
A roller-control unit according to Claim 1 in which the cylinder has first and 
second end members (25',26') at opposite ends respectively, the piston comprises a central 

member (32) to which the carriage is jointed, and the sleeve is part of a tubular sleeve 
member (33, 34) having sleeve ends (36, 41) of lesser diameter and a central part or region 

(39, 43) of greater diameter within which the central member fits. 
A roller-control unit according to Claim 3 in which the tubular sleeve member is 
in two parts separated by a ring-shaped clearance around the central member of the 

piston, and in which that ring-shaped clearance accommodates a piston ring (45) which effects a 
slidable seal between the piston and the cylinder. 
A roller-control unit according to Claim 3 in which both axial ends of the tubular sleeve 
member pass respectively through sliding seals (37, 42) in corresponding apertures (27,28) 

formed in the two end members (25',26') of the cylinder, so that the sleeve ends slide within these 
apertures whenever the central part of the sleeve slides within the cylinder.  

 
A roller-control unit according to Claim 5 in which guidance means (56) are 
interposed between the sleeve ends of the tubular sleeve member and the cylinder end apertures (27,28) to resist 

any sideways thrusts upon the piston, so assisting to maintain the axes of piston and 
cylinder coincident at all times. 
A roller-control unit unit according Claim 6 in which the guidance means (56) 

are separate from the 
sliding seals (37,42) provided at the same locations. 
A roller-control unit according to Claim 3 in which the connection member (14) 
is formed with an internal bore (51) for the supply of lubricant, one end (57) of this bore 

communicating with the roller and the other with a source of lubricant by way of the 
interior of the sleeve. 
A CVT of the toroidal-race rolling-traction type including a roller-control unit 
according to Claim 1.
