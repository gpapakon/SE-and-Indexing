<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to trialkylamine 
derivatives useful in the medical field, and more 
particularly, to trialkylamine derivatives capable of 
significantly ameliorating the digestive tract movement 
(gastrointestinal motility), intermediates for preparing the 
derivatives, and ameliorants for gastrointestinal motility. Hitherto, trimebutine maleate has been primarily used 
as an ameliorant for gastrointestinal motility. The trimebutine maleate has wide utility due to its 
two-face activities of promoting and suppressing the gastric 
movement. However, it is not necessarily satisfactory in 
that relatively large amounts, i.e., 300 mg per day of dose 
are required. To avoid this disadvantage, studies have been conducted 
in search for ameliorants for gastrointestinal motility 
which can replace trimebutine maleate. For example, (1-dimethylaminoindan-1-yl)methyl ester of 
substituted benzoic acid and (1-dimethylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)methyl 
ester of substituted  
 
benzoic acid are reported to have anticonvulsive activity, 
antiulcer activity and local anesthetic activity ("Scientia 
Pharmaceutica" vol. 56, pp. 243-250, 1988). These, however, do not necessarily provide sufficient 
ameliorating activity on the gastrointestinal motility. Accordingly, development of drugs which possess more 
stronger ameliorating activity on the gastrointestinal 
motility has still been desired. The present inventors have carried out earnest studies 
under the mentioned circumstances, and have found that a 
specified trialkylamine derivatives exhibit excellent 
ameliorating activity on the gastrointestinal motility 
leading to completion of the invention. According to the present invention, there is provided 
trialkylamine derivatives represented by the formula (1) or 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof: 
[wherein R¹ and R² may be the same or different from each 
other and each represents lower alkyl; R³, R⁴ and R⁵ may be 
the same or different from one another and each represents 
hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or 
halogen; R⁶ and R⁷ may be the same or different from each  
 
halogen; R⁶ and R⁷ may be the same or different from each 
other and each represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R⁸

lower alkyl),  SO or  SO₂; Z represents -OCO(CH₂)p∼ or
