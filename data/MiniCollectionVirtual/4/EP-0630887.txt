<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns the novel aryl substituted 
heterocycles of formula I, set out below, 


wherein R², R³ and R⁴ have the values defined herein, which antagonize 
the pharmacological actions of one of the endogenous neuropeptide 

tachykinins at the neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor making them useful 
whenever such antagonism is desired, such as in the treatment of 

asthma and related conditions. The invention also provides 
pharmaceutical compositions containing the aryl substituted 

heterocycles for use in such treatment, methods for their use, and 
processes and novel intermediates for their manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns novel aryl substituted heterocycles,
and, more particularly, novel 1-substituted 4-aryl piperidines which
antagonize the pharmacological actions of one or more of the
endogenous neuropeptide tachykinins known as neurokinins, particularly
at the neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor. The novel aryl substituted
heterocycles are useful whenever such antagonism is desired. Thus,
such compounds may be of value in the treatment of those diseases in
which an NK2 receptor is implicated, for example, in the treatment of
asthma and related conditions. The invention also provides
pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel aryl substituted
heterocycles for use in such treatment, methods for their use, and
processes and intermediates for the manufacture of the novel aryl
substituted heterocycles.The mammalian neurokinins comprise a class of peptide
neurotransmitters which are found in the peripheral and central
nervous systems. The three principal neurokinins are Substance P
(SP), Neurokinin A (NKA), and Neurokinin B (NKB). There are also
N-terminally extended forms of at least NKA. At least three known
receptor types are known for the three neurokinins. Based upon their
relative selectivities favoring the neurokinin agonists SP, NKA and
NKB, respectively, the receptors are classifed as neurokinin 1 (NK1),
neurokinin 2 (NK2) and neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptors, respectively. In
the periphery, SP and NKA are localized in C-afferent sensory neurons,
which are characterized by non-myelinated nerve endings known as
C-fibers, and are released by selective depolarization of these
neurons, or selective stimulation of the C-fibers. C-Fibers are
located in the airway epithelium, and the tachykinins are known to
cause profound effects which clearly parallel many of the symptoms
observed in asthmatics. The effects of release or introduction of
tachykinins in mammalian airways include bronchoconstriction,
increased microvascular permeability, vasodilation and activation of
mast cells. Thus, the tachykinins are implicated in the
pathophysiology and the airway hyperresponsiveness observed in
asthmatics; and blockade of the action of released tachykinins may be 
useful in the treatment of asthma and related conditions. Peptidic
NK2 antagonists have been reported. For example, a cyclic hexapeptide
known as L-659,877 has been reported as a selective NK2 antagonist.Nonpeptidic NK2 antagonists also have been reported; for
example, in European Patent Application, Publication Number (EPA)
428434 and EPA 474561 (US
