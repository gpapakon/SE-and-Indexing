<ABSTRACT>
Coupling shaft (1) for transmitting a torque from the 
power take-off shaft of a tractor to the input shaft of a 

driven agricultural machine, which shaft is provided with 
at least one universal joint (2), wherein the shaft (1) is protected 

by a tube (3) of fitting material which is mounted on 
the shaft (1) by means of a bearing ring (10) which protrudes into 

a groove (11) of the shaft (1) and is connected to a cover (4) which 
is fixed to the tube (3) and which projects over the universal 

joint (2), wherein the bearing ring (10) is provided with at 
least two cam-like protrusions (13) arranged along the periphery 

of the ring (10) at a mutual distance and the cover (4) is 
provided with at least two spaces (15) in each case for receiving 

these protrusions (13), wherein by an angular displacement 
of the bearing ring (10) relative to the cover (4) a 

locking in axial sense is effected between cover (4) and 
bearing ring (10), and wherein an insert piece (20) is active 

between cover (4) and bearing ring (10) to counter an opposite 
rotation of this bearing ring (10) such that assembly can take 

place without tools, but disassembly takes place with 
tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a coupling shaft for 
transmitting a torque from the power take-off shaft of a 
driving machine, for instance an agricultural tractor, to 
the input shaft of a driven machine, for instance an 
agricultural machine, which shaft is provided with at 
least one universal joint, such as a cross connection, 
wherein the shaft is protected by a tube of fitting 
material which is mounted on the shaft by means of a 
bearing ring which protrudes into a groove of the shaft 
and is connected to a cover which is fixed to the tube 
and which projects over the universal joint, wherein the 
bearing ring is provided with at least two cam-like 
protrusions arranged along the periphery of the ring at a 
mutual distance and the cover is provided with at least 
two spaces each of which is adapted to receive a 
protrusion, and wherein a separate locking member is active 
between cover and bearing ring in order to lock said 
protrusion of the bearing ring in said space. The above stated coupling shafts normally lie free 
between the driving and driven machine so that for safety 
purposes it is necessary to arrange a protective tube 
therearound which is stationary. This is difficult on 
account of the bearing mounting. The relatively dangerous 
universal joints are guarded by a cover projecting thereover. The assembly of such protective constructions round 
the drive shaft are quite complicated even though many 
proposals for simplification have already been made, as 
disclosed in FR-A-2 218 501. The invention has for its object to provide a very 
simple assembly for performing without auxiliary tools 
and having comparatively few separate components, while  
 
retaining a durable operation under heavy conditions, 
wherein for safety reasons disassembly is not possible 
other than with use of tools, so that undesired disengagement 
is impossible. The coupling shaft according to the invention is 
distinguished in that said space is formed as to allow an 
angular displacement of the bearing ring relative to the 
cover, so a locking in axial sense is effected between 
cover and bearing ring and wherein said locking 
member is arranged so as to be closely-sized in at least 
one of the at least two spaces between the cover and the 
bearing ring to counter an opposite rotation of the 
bearing ring and to indicate a proper positioning between 
the bearing ring and the cover.  
 According to a further development the locking 
member is formed by an insert piece which can be locked 
into a recess of the cover

Coupling shaft assembly (1) for transmitting a torque from 
the power take-off shaft of a driving machine, for 

instance an agricultural tractor, to the input shaft of a 
driven machine, for instance an agricultural machine, 

which shaft is provided with at least one universal joint 
(2), such as a cross connection, wherein the shaft is 

protected by a tube of fitting material (3) which is 
mounted on the shaft by means of a bearing ring (10) 

which protrudes into a groove (11) of the shaft (1) and 
is connected to a cover (4) which is fixed to the tube 

(3) and which projects over the universal joint (2), 
wherein the bearing ring is provided with at least two 

cam-like protrusions (13) arranged along the periphery of 
the ring at a mutual distance and the cover is provided 

with at least two spaces (15) each of which is adapted to 
receive a protrusion (13), and wherein a separate locking member (20, 40) 

is active between cover and bearing ring in order to lock 
said protrusion (13) of the bearing ring (10) in said 

space (15), 
characterized in that
 said space (15) is 
formed as to allow an angular displacement of the bearing 

ring relative to the cover, so a locking in axial sense 
is effected between cover and bearing ring and wherein said 

locking member is arranged so as to be closelysized 
in at least one of the at least two spaces between 

the cover and the bearing ring to counter an opposite 
rotation of the bearing ring and to indicate a proper 

positioning between the bearing ring and the cover. 
Coupling shaft assembly as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the locking member is formed by an insert 
piece which can be locked into a recess of the cover and 

which is provided with a passage opening for lubrication 
purposes.  

 
Coupling shaft assembly as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized 
in that
 locking of the insert piece is effected with 
a snap connection. 
Coupling shaft assembly as claimed in claims 1-3, 
characterized 
in that
 the insert piece is a thin-walled profile 
piece provided with a locking lip. 
Coupling shaft assembly as claimed in any of the foregoing 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the bearing ring has a 
radially directed passage for feed of a lubricant. 
Coupling shaft assembly as claimed in claim 5,
