<ABSTRACT>
The device for mounting and removing wheels on roller blade skates, wherein the axles are set through mutually aligned recesses in a frame and are mounted in recesses, comprises an axle which at a free end has an opening or circumferential groove. Engaging in the opening or circumferential groove is a separable locking member in the form of a locking pin or hook, the axle being set in place by moving the clamping lever (9) to the corresponding rotational position. The wheels (15) of the roller skate are mounted for rotation on this axle.

<CLAIMS>
A device for fastening and detaching rollers (15) in inline
roller skates, in which the roller axles (1) are inserted

through aligned openings (2) of a frame and are mounted in the
openings (2), wherein the roller axle (1), at one of its free

ends, has a circumferential groove (3) or an opening for
engagement of an interlocking member, such as a locking pin,

releasable by pivoting or shifting, and wherein, at the other
end of the roller axle (1), a tensioning lever (9) is hinged so

as to be pivotable transversely to the roller axle (1), said
tensioning lever, in an interlocking position, clamping the

roller axle (1) against the releasable interlocking member (4).
An device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
releasable interlocking member is constituted by a hook (4)

pivitable about an axle (5) substantially parallel to the roller
axle (1), which hook, in its interlocking position, engages in

the circumferential groove (3) of the roller axle (1).
A device according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that
the roller axle (1) is vertically and laterally adjustable

relative to the frame and lockable by means of a bearing
component (12).
