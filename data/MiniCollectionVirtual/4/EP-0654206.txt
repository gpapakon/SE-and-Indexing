<ABSTRACT>
Seed drill with seed coulters (6) which have laterally projecting wings (4, 28, 29, 34) cutting through the soil at the height of the seed horizon. In order to provide an advantageous design of the seed coulters in a simple way, provision is made for fastening the wings (4, 28, 29, 34) to a vertically extending mounting web (22).

<CLAIMS>
Seed drill, which is provided with sowing coulters
(6), which include laterally protruding, plate-like vanes

(4, 28, 29, 34) which cut through the ground at seed level
and are mounted on an upwardly extending retaining web (22)

so as to have a flat and symmetrical configuration,
characterised in that the sowing coulters each have a

pushing or ramming projection, and in that the vanes, which
cut beneath the ground, are mounted as two separate

half-vane elements laterally of the retaining web and/or of
the pushing or ramming projection and comprise bent-over

elements.
Seed drill according to claim 1, characterised in
that the half-vane elements (4, 28, 29, 34) are

interchangeably mounted on the retaining web (22) and/or on
the pushing or ramming projection (24).
Seed drill according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the sowing coulters

(6) are disposed on the frame (7) of the seed drill by
means of a parallelogram-shaped holder (11) so as to be

displaceable in an upwardly extending plane.
Seed drill according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the

parallelogram-shaped holder (11) has a stone repelling
means (14).
Seed drill according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that half-vane elements

(4, 28, 29, 34) of varying widths are mountable on the
retaining web (22) and/or on the pushing or ramming

projection (24).
Seed drill according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the retaining web

(22) and/or the pushing or ramming projection (24) are/is
detachably and/or interchangeably mounted on the coulter

holder (20) and are/is exchangeable for differently
configured coulter types, such as bit coulters, for

example.
Seed drill according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that a depth control

roller (5) is respectively associated with each or a
maximum of two coulters (6).
Seed drill according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the coulters (6)

are suspended so as to be laterally resilient transversely
relative to the direction of travel (13).
Seed drill according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that a deflecting member (31, 35) is disposed beneath

the half-vane elements (4, 28, 29, 34) for the wide
distribution of the seeds and/or fertiliser.
Seed drill according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the deflecting member (31, 35) is detachably

mountable on the half-vane elements (4, 28, 29, 34) and/or
retaining web (22) of the sowing coulters (6).
Seed drill according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that a rigid or

displaceable deflecting member (31, 35) is provided.
Seed drill according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the coulter vane

width (S) is at least approximately identical to, or
greater than, the row width.
