A halogen-free, flame-resistant polymeric  
 

composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
flameproofing system present in it comprises 30 to 

70% by weight of phosphoric acid polyester. 
A halogen-free, flame-resistant polymeric composition 
as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 

composition comprises 15 to 40% by weight of the 
flameproofing system. 
A halogen-free, flame-resistant polymeric composition 
as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 3, 

wherein the composition is a thermoplastic. 
A halogen-free, flame-resistant polymeric composition 
as claimed in claim 4, wherein the thermoplastic 

is a polyolefin.
