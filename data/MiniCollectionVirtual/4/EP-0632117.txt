<ABSTRACT>
In the process according to the invention, provision is made for the lower end of the charging tube (1) to be closed after completion of the charging operation upon commencement of the lifting and for the closure to be maintained until the next charging operation. For this purpose, the lower end of the charging tube (1) is equipped with a movable closure member (7) capable of performing, by means of two hydraulic cylinders (12; 13), a lifting and lowering movement and also a pivoting movement.

Process for charging the oven chambers of a coke-oven
battery with coal using a telescope-type charging pipe to

the coal loading car, whereby the lower end of the said
fitted pipe can be lowered as far as the frames of the

charging holes in the coke-oven battery, 
characterised in

that the lower end of the charging pipe is closed before
being raised and remains closed until the next charging

operation begins.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
gases which remain in the charging pipe at the end of the

charging operation are withdrawn before the charging pipe
is raised.
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that the gases, which are compressed in the charging pipe

when the pipe is raised, are withdrawn from the pipe and
fed to a suitable gas treatment or gas cleaning process.
Process according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the charging pipe is closed once the required minimum

distance between the said pipe and the oven roof is
attained.
Device for performing the process according to claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the lower end of the charging

pipe (1) is fitted with a mobile closing device. 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the
closing device is in the form of a lid (7) which can be

moved up and down and to the side by two hydraulic
cylinders (12; 13).
Device according to claims 5 and 6, characterised in
that the up and down movements of the lid (7), which are

effected by the hydraulic cylinders (12), are controlled by
a stopper (14).
Device according to claims 5 to 7, characterised in
that exhaust pipes (17, 19) are fitted at the side of the

charging pipe (1) and the discharge nozzle (2) and that
these pipes are connected to each other via a flexible pipe

section.
