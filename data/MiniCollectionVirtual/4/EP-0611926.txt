<ABSTRACT>
The quantity of a refrigerant flowing into an evaporator (16) is regulated by adjusting the opening of an expansion valve 
(6) in accordance with the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant at the outlet side of the evaporator (16). The evaporator (16) 

has an evaporation portion (18) provided with a refrigerant flow passage (26) which parallel-communicates with an inflow passage 
(22) and an outflow passage (24). The evaporator (16) further has a flow passage (28) to be cooled which allows the expansion 

valve (6) to communicate with the inflow passage (22), and which has a first restriction (30) at the downstream side of the 
passage (28); and a cooling flow passage (32) connected to the outflow passage (24) and adapted to guide a refrigerant to the outlet. 

The evaporator (16) also has a heat exchange portion (20) formed so that heat exchange can be carried out between the flow 
passage (28) to be cooled and the cooling flow passage (32), and a bypass flow passage (38) which sets up communication between 

the portion which is on the upstream side of the flow passage (28) to be cooled and the portion which is on the downstream 
side of the first restriction (30), and which is provided with a second restriction (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an evaporator for cooling units 
as well as a refrigerating cycle unit. US-A-4 959 972 discloses a wide range refrigeration system with 
suction gas cooling, wherein a by-pass passage with a throttle 
valve is provided for protecting the compressor from overheating. 
The by-pass passage by-passes a solenoid valve and an expansion 
valve and leads to a first suction gas cooling heat exchanger for 
cooling the suction gas in a path to the compressor. JP-A-53-47647 discloses a refrigerating cycle with an 
evaporator, a heat exchange part upstream of the evaporator 
and a throttle device between the evaporator and the heat exchange part.  
 An evaporator has been devised heretofore for use in 
cooling units, in which a core composed of stacked two pieces 
of flat core plates to form a refrigerant passage and a fin 
are alternatively stacked for a plurality of units. However, 
the evaporator in this arrangement is uneven in the distribution 
of refrigerant to each refrigerant passage. In an 
attempt to solve this problem, an evaporator as disclosed in 
the Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 58-41429, for 
example, is known. In this evaporator, a long and narrow 
micro-passage working as a fixed throttles is formed at each 
core plate. Refrigerant condensed into a liquid refrigerant 
by a condenser is fed into the evaporator as it is, and then 
distributed to each refrigerant passage at an even flow rate 
with the fixed throttles of each core so that the pressure of 
the refrigerant is reduced thereby. On the other hand, an evaporator provided with a heat 
exchange part for heat exchange between a high-temperature 
pipe of the receiver outlet side , and a low-temperature pipe  
 
between the evaporator and a thermo-sensing tube to minimize 
the gaseous refrigerant which does not participate in cooling 
performed in the downstream from a receiver and to increase 
the effective refrigerant (i.e., supercooling) has been 
proposed (as disclosed in the Nippondenso Technical Disclosure 
Bulletin No. 40-076, issued on March 15, 1985). However, in these conventional evaporators with a 
fixed throttle, when refrigerant in gas-liquid two phase state 
flows into the fixed throttle, the even distribution of the 
refrigerant can not be achieved. Namely, there are two types 
of fixed throttles; one through which gaseous refrigerant 
mainly flows, and the other through which liquid refrigerant 
mainly flows. Accordingly, it is conceivable that the evaporator 
with fixed throttles is
