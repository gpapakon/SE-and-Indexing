<ABSTRACT>
A display information conversion apparatus includes 
a game process circuit (1⊘4) by which a game program 

stored in a memory (32) of a memory cartridge (3⊘) for a 
first game machine is executed, the game process circuit 

(1⊘4) is approximately the same as that of the first game 
machine. Bit-serial dot data is outputted from the game 

process circuit (1⊘4), and converted into bit-parallel 
character data by a digital video data interface (114), 

and the character data is written in a buffer RAM (116). 
The character data is transferred to a second game 

machine coupled to a raster-scan display through a 
connector (113), so that a game image according to the 

game program stored in the memory is displayed on the 
raster-scan display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display information conversion
apparatus.As one example of a kind of first information processing apparatus, a
dot-matrix liquid crystal game machine which has been put into a commercial
market under the name "Game Boy (trademark)", for example, is well known.
Furthermore, as one example of a kind of second information processing
apparatus, a television game machine which has been put into a commercial
market under the name "Super Nintendo Entertainment System (trademark)",
for example, is well known.In the above described "Game Boy" and "Super Nintendo Entertainment
System", signal processing specifications (formats) are different from each
other, even if sizes etc. of memory cartridges are made equal to each other, a
memory cartridge for one of the both can not be applied to the other of the
both. Therefore, a user must have different kinds of game machines, and 
manufacturers of memory cartridges must manufacture memory cartridges
separately for respective game machines even if a game content is the same.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
display information conversion apparatus adapted for making a storage
medium, for storing a first program capable of being executed by a first
information processing apparatus which is able to display a video image on the
basis of a first specification or dot-matrix display, applicable to a second
information processing apparatus, which is constituted to display a video image
on the basis of a second specification or raster-scan display.Further according to this aspect of the present invention there is
provided a display information processing system which includes the above
display information conversion apparatus according to the immediately
preceding paragraph.The second specification or format may have an image quality which
is higher than that of the first specification. Further according to the present invention there is provided a display
information conversion apparatus for making a storage medium, which stores
a first program capable of being executed by a first information processing
apparatus which is constituted to display a video image on the basis of a first
specification or dot-matrix display, applicable to a second information
processing apparatus, which is constituted to display a video image on the
basis of a second specification or raster-scan display, said conversion apparatus
comprising:
a first connection portion to which said storage medium can be
detachably attached;a second
</DESCRIPTION>
