<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the stabilisation of pyrrolopyrrole pigments against the
effects of light and weathering by addition of an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine.Pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole pigments have been known for some years and are described, for
example, in US-A 4 415 685 and US- A 4 579 949. Some of these have proven successful
as high-quality pigments. Although they already have very good light stability and
weathering resistance, it has now been found that these properties can, surprisingly, be
further improved, in transparent as well as in opaque pigment forms, if the pigments are
mixed with an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine.N-hydrocarbyloxy amines, in particular N-hydrocarbyloxy derivatives of HALS (Hindered
Amine Light Stabiliser), have been disclosed e.g. in US Patents 4 921 962, 5 019 613,
5 021 483, 5 021 486, 5 021 577 and in EP-A 389 428 as light stabilisers for polymers
against the degradative effects of actinic stimuli. They were found particularly effective in
stabilising organic materials such as polyolefins, elastomers, polyvinyl chloride,
polyesters, polyurethanes, ambient cured and acid catalysed thermoset coatings or
enamels. EP-A 309 401 discloses the use of N-hydroxy-HALS for preventing inadequacies
such as embrittlement, cracking, corrosion, erosion, loss of gloss, chalking and
yellowing of coatings containing some specific organic pigments such as phthalocyanine
and azo pigments.It has now been found that very surprisingly, the light stability and weathering resistance
of pyrrolopyrrole pigments, which is already high, can be further improved by mixing or
coating the pigment particles with an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine.The present invention accordingly relates to light-stabilised pigment compositions
comprising 
a) at least one pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole pigment of the formula

in which A and B, independently of one another, are isocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic
radicals, and D is an oxygen or sulfur atom, andb) from 1 to 100 % by weight, based on the pigment, of an N-hydrocarbyloxy amine.Pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole pigments are known. They are described in detail, for example, in
US-A 4 415 685, columns 1, 2 and 3, and in particular in Examples 1, 6 and 27 to 49, and
in US-A 4 579 949, in particular in Examples 1 to 46.The N-hydrocarbyloxy amines are likewise known compounds. Any that are still novel
can be prepared in analogy to well known methods.Of particular interest are pigment compositions in which a pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole pigment
of the formula I is employed, in which A and B, independently of
