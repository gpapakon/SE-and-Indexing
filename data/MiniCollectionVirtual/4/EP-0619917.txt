<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed generally to RF 
excited gas discharge lights sources, and more particularly 
to a shrouded pin electrode structure for RF excited gas 
discharge light sources. RF gas discharge light sources generally include a gas 
containment vessel or envelope, and an electrode structure 
for coupling RF energy into the discharge gas in the 
containment vessel. The electrode structure is driven by 
an RF source, and generates a magnetic or electric field 
that excites the gas molecules. The excited gas molecules 
emit photons as drop to state(s) with lower energy. Electrode structures utilized in RF gas discharge 
light sources commonly comprise pins that are located 
internal to the gas containment vessel and exposed to the 
contained gas. The primary energy transfer mechanism 
involves the acceleration/deceleration of electrons which 
are thermonically excited off the electrode surface. Considerations with the use of internal pin electrodes 
include the use of a glass to metal seal which is susceptible 
to manufacturing defects, as well as failure and 
leakage during use, particularly in environments with 
significant vibration or rapid thermal transitions. Also,  
 
electrode material can easily contaminate the discharge gas. Document DE-A-4 203 594 discloses a gas discharge lamp 
comprising a gas tube for containing the discharge gas. An inner 
electrode extends through all of the length of the tube such 
that at both ends of the tube gas seals between the inner 
electrode and the tube are necessary. Further provided is an 
outer electrode which runs along the length of the tube on an 
outer surface thereof parallel to said inner electrode. The surface of the inner electrode can be coated with a 
metal for facilitating electron emission or with a dielectric 
material. The preferred coating material is MgO which can further 
serve as protecting coating. In view of the above it is an object of the present 
invention to provide an RF excited gas discharge light source 
having an internal pin electrode structure with increased 
reliability. According to the invention this object is achieved with 
an RF excited gas discharge light source having a gas containment 
structure and a discharge gas contained within the volume of 
the gas containment structure, comprising:  
 
a pin shaped electrode extending into the volume of 
the gas containment structure such that within the gas containment 
structure said pin electrode is indirectly surrounded by 
discharge gas along a length thereof,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An RF excited gas discharge light source having a 
gas containment structure (15, 55) and a discharge gas contained 

within the volume of the gas containment structure (15, 55), 
comprising: 


a pin shaped electrode (11, 51) extending into the 
volume of the gas containment structure (15, 55) such that within 

the gas containment structure (15, 55) said pin electrode (11, 
51) is indirectly surrounded by discharge gas along the length 

thereof, inclusive the distal end of the pin electrode (11, 
51); and 
means (13, 53) for physically and electrically 
isolating said pin electrode (11, 51) from the discharge gas 

such that the gas does not contact said pin electrode (11, 51), 
said means (13, 53) also forming gas seals (17, 57) 
at ends of the gas containment structure (15, 55). 
The light source of claim 1, characterized in that 
said means (13, 53) for physically isolating comprises a gas 

impermeable dielectric coating (53) disposed over said pin (51). 
The light source of claim 2, characterized in that 
said gas impermeable dielectric coating (53) comprises glass. 
The light source of claim 2, characterized in that 
said gas impermeable dielectric coating (53) comprises ceramic. 
The light source of claim 2, characterized in that 
said gas impermeable coating (53) comprises porcelain.  

 
The light source of claim 1, characterized in that 
said means (13, 53) for physically isolating comprises an 

elongated gas impermeable dielectric tube (13a). 
The light source of any of claims 1 - 6, characterized 
in that the gas containment vessel (15, 55) produces unwanted 

field shunting and wherein said length of said pin electrode 
(11, 51) surrounded by discharge gas is selected to reduce the 

field shunting produced by the gas containment structure (15, 
55). 
The light source of any of claims 1 - 7, characterized 
in that two pin-shaped electrodes (11, 51) are provided which 

extend into the volume of the gas containment structure (15, 
55) from opposite ends thereof.
