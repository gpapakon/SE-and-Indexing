<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for producing small frozen confectionery articles (19) comprises master moulds (11) containing countermoulds (13) and constituting a moulding assembly mounted on an endless chain (12) which travels step by step successively through freezing areas (x) and heating areas (y). Once it is formed in the cavity between the master mould and the countermould, the article is demoulded in two stages, the countermould being removed first, then the article (19) itself which is then taken up by a chain (29) and conveyed away towards a wrapping station. The countermould is placed back in the master mould and the master mould/countermould assembly is then turned upside down, then cleaned. The process allows the production in particular of ice lollies having a convex part.

Process for manufacturing small articles of ice 
confectionery having a convex part, in particular ice 

lollies, quasi-ellipsoidal in shape, characterized in that 
there is placed in an open metal master mould, the base of 

which forms a half cavity and the upper part of which 
widens out upwards, a countermould complementary to the 

master mould, consisting of a piece of solid metal 
frustoconical in shape adjusted to the master mould, 

recessed in a half-cavity facing downwards, so as to form a 
cavity with the master mould and having an opening made in 

its upper part,
 
that an ice confectionery composition is introduced into 

the cavity through the said opening,
 
that the said composition is cooled,
 
that a stick is optionally placed into the partially 

hardened composition through the opening,
 
that the countermould is heated and then removed from the 

master mould,
 
that the master mould is heated and the article is then 

demoulded and removed,
 
that the countermould is replaced into the master mould and 

that the master mould and countermould are washed at a 
washing station. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
master mould and the countermould in contact with the 

master mould are cooled by passing them through a tank of 
brine or glycol-containing water throughout all the 

operations preceding heating of the countermould. 
Process according to claim 1, for manufacturing 
composite products, characterized in that the operation of 

filling with the ice composition is followed by a step in 
which the still liquid composition in the centre of the 

cavity is withdrawn by suction to form a shell, and there 
is then a second filling of the free space with a second  

 
ice composition and, in the case of an ice lolly, prior to 

insertion of the stick. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
operations of suction, followed by filling of the free 

space are repeated several times, which leads to layered 
products. 
Process according to claim 1, for manufacturing ice 
lollies characterized in that the operation of inserting 

the stick is followed by final filling of the space close 
to the opening. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that, once demoulded, the articles are 

dipped in water to give them an attractive surface glaze. 
Machine for manufacturing small articles of ice 
confectionery, in particular in quasi-ellipsoidal form, 

characterized in that it comprises
 
a moulding assembly consisting of a master mould and a 

complementary countermould,
 
a support bar for the master moulds, fixed to an endless 

chain conveyor,
 
a support bar for the countermoulds, travelling together 

with the endless chain conveyor and capable of separating 
from this on its return run,
 
means for cooling the moulding assembly,
 
means for filling the
 moulding assembly with the ice 
composition,
 
optionally, means for inserting a stick into the partially 

hardened ice composition,
 
means for heating the master moulds and countermoulds,
 
a device for vertically extracting the countermoulds and 

moulded products and for vertically replacing the 
countermoulds in the empty master moulds,
 
an endless chain conveyor for removing the moulded articles  

 
and
 
means for washing the master moulds and countermoulds. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that it 
also comprises means for withdrawing the still liquid ice 

composition by suction so as to form a shell and means for 
filling the shell thus formed with another ice composition. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that it 
comprises in addition means for glazing the articles 

removed from the mould. 
Assembly for moulding articles of ice confectionery, 
characterized in that it consists of : 


a master mould comprising a lower half-cavity which is 
demouldable in a downward vertical direction relative to 

the article, an upper wall widening out upwards and an 
annular shoulder between the lower half cavity and the 

upper wall
 
and 
a countermould complementary to the master mould, which is 
demouldable in an upward vertical direction relative to the 

article, the outer part of which coincides perfectly with 
the inner wall of the upper part of the master mould, 

consisting of a solid metal piece with a frustoconical 
shape, recessed in a downward facing half-cavity, so as to 

form the moulding cavity with the master mould, and which 
has an opening made in its upper part, the said metal piece 

comprising a lower chamfer resting on the shoulder of the 
master mould and gripping bars in its upper part.
