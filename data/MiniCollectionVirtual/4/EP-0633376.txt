<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electromagnetically controlled blocking lock with a bolt (2) actuated by means of a handle and having an electromagnet (9) acting as a holding magnet, with a blocking lever (7) provided with a magnet armature (7a), with a control lever (6) coupled to the blocking lever (7) and with an interrogator bolt (4) actuated by the handle. The object of the invention is to prevent the possibility of any action on the bolt (2) in order to increase security in the interrogation phase. This is achieved, according to the invention, in that the handle engages into a coupling disc (3) which drives the interrogator bolt (4) via a stud (3d), in that the coupling disc (3) carries an eccentric (3c) which engages into a driving cam (2b) of the main bolt (2), and in that the eccentric (3c) of the coupling disc (3) executes an idle travel while the interrogator bolt (4) is covering the short distance necessary for actuating the blocking lever (7) and the control lever (6).

An electromagnetically controlled blocking lock with a main 
bolt (2) activated by a handle with an electromagnet 

functioning as holding magnet, a bolt lever (7) featuring a 
magnetic anchor (7a), a control lever (6) coupled to the 

bolt lever (7) and a monitoring bolt (4) operated by the 
lever whose passage pin (4b) projects against a bearing-out 

(6a) of the control lever (6), whereby the control lever (6) 
only tilts into the release position if the anchor (7a) of 

the bolt lever (7) is held fast,
 
characterized by 


the handle gripping into a clutch disk (3) driving the 
monitoring bolt (4) with a mandrel (3d), 
by the clutch disk (3) bearing an eccentric (3c) which grips 
into a driving curvature (2b) of the main bolt (2) in order 

to effect movement of the main bolt (2) and 
the eccentric (3c) of the clutch disk (3) covering an idle 
distance while the monitoring bolt (4) covers the small 

distance required for activation of the bolt lever (7) and 
the control lever (6). 
A blocking lock according to claim 1 characterized by the 
clutch disk (3
) featuring a key channel (3b), 

by a two-way key lock being mounted beneath the above lock 
(1) and 
the bolt of this lock arresting the bolt lever for emergency 
opening.
