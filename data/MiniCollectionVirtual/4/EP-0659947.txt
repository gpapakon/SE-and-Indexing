<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control arrangement (10) for a shut-off valve which can be actuated by subatmospheric pressure and is intended for a subatmospheric-sewage system. The control arrangement comprises a main piston (22) via which valves (70, 72) can be actuated, in order to open and to close an extraction valve and an aeration valve independently of one another.

A control arrangement (10) for a shutoff valve actuatable by negative pressure and
intended for a negative pressure wastewater system, including a first valve (14) that

is actuatable by dynamic pressure resulting from accumulated water and that closes
or opens a connection (38) that carries negative pressure, and a chamber (28), which

is pressure-adjustable via the first valve and in which or adjacent to which a main
piston (22), preferably acted upon by a spring (24), is displaceably disposed, by means

of which piston, as a function of the pressure prevailing in the chamber, a negative
pressure connection (74) to at least the shutoff valve is controllable, wherein at least

one second valve (70), independent of the main piston (22) but positively coupled to
it preferably via a driver (64) is provided, by way of which second valve the shutoff

valve can be connected upon by negative pressure,
characterized in that

the control arrangement (10) includes a third valve (72), which is positively coupleable
to the main piston (22) and which controls a connection with a further shutoff valve

or with a ventilation valve that delivers air into the negative pressure wastewater
system.
Control arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

a further fourth valve (42) begins at the main piston (22) and is preferably displaceable
along the longitudinal axis thereof, which valve closes or uncovers the

connection (38) leading to the chamber (28) as a function of the position of the main
piston.
Control arrangement according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
the second and third valves (70, 72) have second and third valve pistons (80, 82)

extending parallel to one another and in parallel to the main piston (22), which
preferably have lengths that differ from each other, or that at least one of the valve

pistons is adjustable in its length.
Control arrangement according to Claim 3,
characterized in that

the driver (64) begins at the main piston (22) and in order to open the second or third
valve (70, 72) acts upon their valve pistons (80, 82), whereby the valve piston (80, 82)

of the second or third valve (70, 72) preferably has on its end a disk-shaped element
(84, 86) that is embodied as at least peripherally flexible and that as a function of the

position of the main piston (22) during the displacement thereof penetrates a recess
or indentation, adapted to the element, of the driver (64) or is drivable thereby to open

the second or third valve (70, 72).
Control arrangement according to Claim 4,
characterized in that

the driver (64) of the main piston (22) is a disk, which has a number of openings (66,
68) that correspond to that of the disk elements (84, 86) of the second and third valves

(70, 72) to be engaged, wherein upon the buildup of negative pressure in the chamber
(28), the driver of the main piston overcomes the disk element (84, 86) of the second

or third valve (70, 72), and upon displacement of the main piston in the opposite
direction, dictated by the reduction of negative pressure in the chamber (28) drives the

second or third valve with it over a predetermined displacement path in order to open
the valve.
Control arrangement according to one of Claims 3 - 5,
characterized in that

a positive coupling between the main piston (22) and the second and third valve piston
(80, 82) is effected such that one of the valves (72) cannot be opened until after re-closure

of the other valve (70) or that the valves are opened at overlapping times. 
Control arrangement according to one of Claims 2 - 6,
characterized in that

the control arrangement (10) includes a cylindrical housing (12), along the center axis
of which the first valve (14) with its valve piston (20), the main piston (22), and the

fourth valve (42) received by the main piston are preferably guided in telescoping
fashion and disposed displaceably, that the main piston is kept guided by a diaphragm

(30) that on one side closes in pressure-tight fashion the chamber (28) that can be
acted upon with negative pressure, and that a limiter (52) acts upon the main piston

or the fourth valve (42) in such a way that a displacement of the main piston is
effected upon increasing negative pressure in the chamber (28), or a closure of the

fourth valve is effected only at a predetermined negative pressure in the chamber (28).
Control arrangement according to Claim 7,
characterized in that

the limiter (52) is embodied as spring-actuated ball elements (54), acting radially upon
the main piston (22, 46), which ball elements, in a first terminal position of the main

piston (22), can lock in detent fashion into an indentation (60) let into the main piston.
Control arrangement according to Claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that

the limiter (52) includes ball elements (54) acting radially upon the piston (44) of the
fourth valve (42), which ball elements lock in detent fashion into indentations such

as grooves when the fourth valve is opened or closed, wherein a tension element such
as a tension ring (98) that surrounds the ball elements acts upon them.
Control arrangement according to one of the preceding Claims 2 - 9, and Claim 2,
characterized in that

the connection carrying the negative pressure to the chamber (28) and closeable by the
first or fourth valve (14, 42) preferably is a line (38) extending in a wall of the 

housing (12), wherein the fourth valve (42) closes the chamber (28) relative to the
connection (38) that can be acted upon with negative pressure during the displacement

of the main piston (22) from its second terminal position, adjacent to the first valve
(14), when there is pronounced negative pressure in the chamber (28) to its first

terminal position or basic position in the chamber (28), when there is low negative
pressure, such that the pressure in the chamber (28) can be equalized with the pressure

surrounding the control arrangement (10).
Control arrangement according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

a positive coupling via tension or spring elements is effected between the main piston
(22) and the second or third valve (70, 72).
Control arrangement according to Claims 7 - 11, and Claim 7
characterized in that

the limiter is formed by a magnet, which is connected to the main piston (22) and
which interacts with the housing (12), or a portion thereof, whenever the main piston

assumes a position that is equivalent to the position when ambient pressure prevails
in the chamber (28).
