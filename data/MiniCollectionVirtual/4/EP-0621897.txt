Process for producing lignolytic enzymes by means 
of white rot fungi, a culture consisting of fungi of 

subclass Aphyllophorales being placed into a closed 
fermentation vessel charged with nutrient solution, and 

the suspension there, to produce pellets of Aphyllophorales, 
being agitated so gently that no shear forces 

destroying the pellets can arise, characterized in that 
the enzymes are produced with addition of yeasts or
 
benzaldehydes, chlorobenzaldehydes, nitrobenzaldehydes, 

hydroxybenzaldehydes, aminobenzaldehydes, methylbenzaldehydes, 
diarylene, triarylene, dialkylalkanes, trialkyl-alkanes, 

open-chain or cyclic imines or derivatives of 
the said substances, as inducing compounds, with the 

induction being able to be performed once or repeatedly, 
and the enzymes are then harvested. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, after completion of the enzyme production, the 

pellets are separated off from the liquid nutrient medium 
and recycled to the fermenter again for enzyme 

production. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the culture is placed into a 

fermenter which is equipped with an agitator whose 
paddles can be set in such a manner that no shear forces 

destroying the pellets arise. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that Phanerochaete chrysosporium is 

placed into the fermentation vessel with addition of 
yeasts. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,  
 

characterized in that Coriolus versicolor, with addition 
of benzaldehydes, chlorobenzaldehydes, nitrobenzaldehydes, 

hydroxybenzaldehydes, aminobenzaldehydes, methylbenzaldehydes, 
diarylene, triarylene, dialkylalkanes, 

trialkylalkanes, open-chain or cyclic imines or derivatives 
of the said substances as inducing compounds, with 

the induction being able to be performed once or repeatedly, 
produces the enzymes.
