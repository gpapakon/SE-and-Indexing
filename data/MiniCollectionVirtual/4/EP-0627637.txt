<ABSTRACT>
Microlenses (228) are formed on a substrate (12) 
including colour filters, by depositing a layer of 

photosensitive resin (27) having a high refractive 
index, photo-etching the photosensitive resin layer (27) 

in a pattern of squares or stripes, and heat-treating 

the substrate at a temperature low enough so as not to 
affect the colour filters, while irradiating the 

photosensitive resin so that it is softened at that 
temperature so as to form the microlenses (228) under 

surface tension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid image
pickup device such as a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera,
for example, wherein microlenses are formed as condenser
lenses on the upper surface of light receiving portions of
the substrate.As the chip size of solid image pickup devices
decreases and the number of pixels per a device increases,
the area of each light receiving portion on the substrate
has been reduced. As a result, an amount of light received
by each light receiving portion decreases and therefore
sensitivity (output/(amount of incident light)) of the
device lowers.In order to solve the above problem, a solid
image pickup device has been proposed, which is shown in
Fig. 1 and is generally indicated by a reference numeral
60. As shown in Fig. 1, microlenses 28 made of a
transparent polymeric resin are formed on the upper surface
of each of light receiving portions (not shown) which are
pixels.The microlenses 28 serve as condenser lenses for
incident light, that is, incident light is converged to the 
light receiving portions by the microlenses 28. Therefore,
effective light received by each light receiving portion
increases and the sensitivity deterioration is prevented.Generally, the solid image pickup device 60 has
been contained in a ceramic package 76 as shown in Fig. 2.
In Fig. 2, a reference numeral 70 indicates a ceramic
substrate mounting the solid image pickup device 60, a
reference numeral 74 indicates a lead pin and a reference
numeral 78 indicates a glass lid for the ceramic package
76.Recently, a molded package 72 using a transparent
resin, as shown in Fig. 3, is replacing the ceramic package
76 for the reason that the production cost can be lower.
In this case, the following problem occurs.The microlenses 28 are formed of polystyrene,
acrylic resin, novolak resin or other transparent resins.
On the other hand, epoxy resin is used as a molding resin.
The above transparent resins of the microlenses 28 have a
refractive index of 1.5-1.6 and the molding epoxy resin
also has a refractive index of 1.5-1.6. Therefore, when
the solid image pickup device 60 is packaged by the molding
resin, the condenser effect or light converging effect of
the microlenses 28 is largely reduced or canceled by the
molding resin. The document JP-A-60 060756 discloses a method of
forming a microlens array in which a pattern is
irradiated with ultraviolet rays and deformed to a
lens-shaped pattern through heat treatment.According to the present invention, there is
provided a method of forming microlenses on

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming microlenses (228) on a
substrate (12) in a solid image pickup device,

comprising the steps of:

forming a layer (27) of a photosensitive resin
which has permeability to light on a substrate (12)

which has a plurality of light receiving portions (16)
arrayed in one or more rows;
selectively photo-etching the photosensitive resin
layer (27) in a square or stripe pattern to leave the

photosensitive resin layer (27) in a sectionally
rectangular shape on the substrate in positions

corresponding to respective ones of the light receiving
portions (16) or positions corresponding to respective

rows of the light receiving portions (16);
irradiating the photosensitive resin layer (27)
with ultraviolet light; and
applying a heat treatment to the substrate (12)
provided with the photosensitive resin layer (27) so

that the photosensitive resin is softened to be semi-spherically
or semi-cylindrically shaped by surface

tension of the photosensitive resin;

   characterised in that the substrate (12) is
provided with color filters (40R, 40G, 40B) covering

light receiving portions (16) and the photosensitive
resin has a refractive index of 1.65 or more; the method

being further characterised in that the heat treatment
is applied at a temperature not affecting properties of 

the color filters (40R, 40G, 40B) and in that the
ultraviolet light is irradiated onto the photosensitive

resin layer (27) during said heat treatment so that
photo active groups contained in the photosensitive

resin are decomposed and the photosensitive resin is
softened at said temperature.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
temperature at which the heat treatment is performed is

below 160°C.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein near
ultraviolet light is irradiated onto the photosensitive

resin layer (27).
