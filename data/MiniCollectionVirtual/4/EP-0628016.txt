<ABSTRACT>
A coupling arrangement serves to couple a dispenser head (1) to a valve (2) which is mounted in a connecting piece (3) on a container (4) for a liquid, such as beer under pressure from a gas, e.g. CO2. Sealing between the two parts (1, 2) takes place by means of a sealing ring (16) which is arranged axially slidably in a recess (17) in the dispenser head. The head moreover contains a slide (9) which can be moved vertically up and down with a handgrip (10) to close and open the container and the pressure gas inlet, respectively. The slide downwardly has a first outwardly directed collar (28) to lift the sealing ring clear of the valve when the container is to be closed and the dispenser head to be removed. The slide moreover has a second outwardly directed collar (29) to cause the sealing ring to engage the valve before the slide opens the valve and the gas inlet. To ensure effective sealing and easy removal the sealing ring (16) has a relatively large, annular rib (19) of triangular cross-section on the underside. By means of the coupling arrangement a dispenser head can easily and without any difficulty be mounted on a valve in a pressure container for a liquid under pressure from a gas and be removed from it. Further, the operating staff will not be splashed with liquid when the container is opened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a coupling arrangement for coupling 
a dispenser head to a valve mounted in a connecting piece 
on a container for a liquid, such as beer under pressure 
from a gas, e.g. CO2, said dispenser head comprising; a 
gas inlet; a hollow slide slidable by means of a handgrip 
between a lower position in which the valve is open and 
the liquid can flow out through the hollow slide, and an 
upper position in which the valve is closed; an elastomeric 
sealing ring which, co-axial with the slide, is arranged 
axially slidably in a recess downwardly in the dispenser 
head and serves to form a seal between said head 
and the valve upon coupling; and a first outwardly directed 
collar so provided on the slide that the collar 
tries to lift the sealing ring clear of the valve when the 
slide is moved towards its upper position. In the most widely used dispenser head types for coupling 
arrangements of the above-mentioned type the sealing ring 
is retained in the dispenser head by means of a ring-shaped 
rib which is provided on the inner side of the recess 
and engages a corresponding groove in the sealing 
ring. This therefore just has a very small or frequently 
almost no freedom of movement in an axial direction. When 
the valve is closed by pulling the slide up to its upper 
position, a cavity in the dispenser head above the sealing 
ring is blocked. However, this cavity will still be filled 
with pressure gas, which keeps the sealing ring so hard 
against the valve that it is extremely difficult to remove 
the dispenser head from the valve when the container e.g. 
is to be replaced by a new one. In particular, the problem 
has been found to be serious in connection with the structures 
where coupling takes place by moving the dispenser  
 
head transversely over an outwardly protruding flange on 
the valve. The British patent specification 2 185 470 describes a 
coupling arrangement in which it has been attempted to 
solve the above-mentioned problem of removing the dispenser 
head. In this case the sealing ring is mounted to 
be somewhat axially slidable in the recess of the dispenser 
head, and the slide is downwardly provided with an 
outwardly directed collar which lifts the sealing ring 
slightly clear of the upper side of the valve when the 
slide is moved up toward its upper position by applying an 
upward pull to the handgrip of the dispenser head. The 
confined pressure gas in the cavity of the dispenser head 
will then escape below the sealing ring and relieve the 
pressure on it,

A coupling arrangement for coupling a dispenser head 
to a valve which is mounted in a connecting piece on a 

container for a liquid, such as beer under pressure from a 
gas, e.g. CO
2
, said dispenser head comprising: a gas inlet; 
a hollow slide slidable by means of a handgrip between 

a lower position in which the valve is open and the 
liquid can flow out through the hollow slide, and an upper 

position in which the valve is closed; an elastomeric 
sealing ring which, co-axial with the slide, is arranged 

axially slidably in a recess downwardly in the dispenser 
head and serves to form a seal between said head and the 

valve upon coupling; and a first outwardly directed collar 
so provided on the slide that the 
collar tries to lift the 
sealing ring clear of the valve when the slide is moved 

toward its upper position, 
characterized
 in 
that the slide is provided with a second outwardly directed 

collar which has a larger diameter than the bore of 
the sealing ring and is so positioned on the slide in an 

axial direction that when moving toward its lower position 
the slide, by engagement between the collar and the sealing 

ring, carries along the sealing ring down to engage 
the valve before the slide opens the valve and the gas 

inlet. 
A coupling arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the second outwardly directed 
collar has a slightly larger diameter than the bore of the 

sealing ring and, in cross-section, the shape of a triangle 
whose vertex faces outwardly. 
A coupling arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized
 in that the sealing ring is 
provided with a plurality of inwardly directed noses and  

 
the slide with a third outwardly directed collar which is 

arranged at a distance below the second collar of the 
slide corresponding to the height of the noses, and that 

the diameter of the slide between the two collars has a 
diameter corresponding to the diametrical distance between 

the noses. 
A coupling arrangement according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 

characterized
 in that a ring-shaped disc is 
arranged in the recess of the dispenser head above the 

sealing ring, and a breast is arranged on the slide, said 
breast being so axially positioned on the slide that when 

engaged with the disc it causes the disc to compress the 
sealing ring axially when the slide is in its lower position. 
A coupling arrangement according to one or more of 
claims 1-4, 
characterized
 in that the inner 
side of the sealing ring is formed with a lower annular 

rib between the inner and outer sides of the sealing ring, 
said rib in cross-section having the shape of a triangle 

with a downwardly facing vertex which extends further down 
than the rest of the underside of the sealing ring in the 

unloaded state of the sealing ring. 
A coupling arrangement according to one or more of 
claims 1-4, 
characterized
 in that a plurality 
of shoulders are arranged on the upper side of the sealing 

ring substantially vertically above the lower annular rib 
on the underside, said shoulders rising above the rest of 

the upper side of the sealing ring. 
A coupling arrangement according to one or more of 
claims 1-6, 
characterized
 in that the sealing 
ring is peripherally formed with a lip which touches the 

ring face of the recess.  
 
A coupling arrangement according to claims 1-7,
