<ABSTRACT>
A print material variable support mechanism (10) to reduce buckling of print 
material (38) toward a printhead (22) during printing. The preferred embodiment 

includes a moveable platen (12) pivotally mounted adjacent a drive roller (32). The 
platen is positioned adjacent and below a printhead (22) such that the printhead and the 

platen define a print zone (26) therebetween. A measuring device (16) is operatively 
associated with a print controller (18) such that the print controller effects movement of 

the platen during relatively high ink density printing such that the sheet (38) is allowed 
to buckle downwardly. In the preferred embodiment, the measuring device (16) is an 

ink drop counter which determines how many, ink drops are placed on the sheet (38) to 
create the desired image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to print material support
mechanisms for ink-jet printers. More particularly, the invention concerns an apparatus
which provides a moveable platen to reduce buckling of print medium toward a
printhead during printing. When ink density on the print material reaches a
predetermined threshold level, a drive mechanism moves the platen downwardly, away
from the print material, so that the print material is allowed to buckle downwardly
thereby avoiding contact with a printhead.Conventionally, ink-jet printers include a printhead positioned above a
print medium during printing. The print medium can also be referred to as print
material. For purposes of this disclosure, the print material can be mylar, paper,
cardboard, envelope material, or any other sheet material. A support structure, usually
a platen, is positioned below and typically supports the print medium during printing.
During printing, ink from the printhead is printed on the print material to form the
desired image. However, ink from the printhead wets the fibers of the print material,
causing the print material to buckle or curve. As the ink density, or amount of ink,
printed on a page increases, the amount of bending or curving increases. Because the
platen is positioned directly below the print material, the print material tends to buckle
or curve upwardly instead of downwardly away from the printhead. This upward
buckling increases the possibility of the print material contacting the printhead, smearing
the freshly printed ink on the print material.This buckling, or deformation, creates many additional problems. For
example, the deformation creates an unappealing appearance of the final documents.
In addition, as the paper deforms, the distance between the paper and the ink-jet
pens,
also called head-to-print material spacing, across the width of the page varies. Due to
this uneven spacing during printing, the ink droplets are not evenly applied to the print
material from the same distance. To achieve high quality print images, the head-to-print
material spacing in an ink-jet printer should be maintained at approximately 1-to-1.5
millimeters or lower. This is relatively easy at lower ink densities, but difficult to 
maintain at higher densities. Thus, the uneven spacing due to print medium bending
causes severe problems in the final print quality of the sheet.In the past, in an effort to reduce these types of paper bending, printers
have included high-powered heaters to drive off moisture. However,

<CLAIMS>
A wet ink printer mechanism (10) to reduce buckling of print medium (38)
toward a printhead (22) during printing, the printer mechanism comprising: a moveable

platen (12) positioned adjacent a print medium (38) during printing, the platen (12)
supporting the print medium (38) during relatively low ink density printing and the

platen moving away from the print medium during relatively high ink density printing
thereby allowing the print medium to buckle away from a printhead (22) during relatively

high ink density printing, and a platen control device including an ink density sensing
mechanism (16) operatively associated with the platen (12) to effect movement of the

platen away from the print medium when the ink density sensing mechanism (16) senses
relatively high ink density during printing.
The printer mechanism (10) of claim 1 which further comprises a buckling
limiter (24) positioned adjacent the print medium (38) and downstream from the

printhead (22), the buckling limiter preventing the print medium from buckling past the
buckling limiter to prevent the print medium from contacting the printhead.
The printer mechanism (10) of claim 1 which further comprises a drive
mechanism (14) operatively associated with the platen (12) and the ink density sensing

mechanism (16) such that the drive mechanism selectively moves the platen to a
retracted position when the sensing mechanism (16) senses relatively high ink density.
The printer mechanism (10) of claim 1 which further comprises a

printhead (22) for printing on a print medium (38), the printhead (22), the printhead and
the platen defining a print zone (26) therebetween, the print zone having an entrance

region (28) and an exit region (30).
The printer mechanism (10) of claim 4 which further comprises a feed
device (32) positioned upstream of the print zone entrance region (28), the feed device

conveying the print medium through the print zone (26) during printing.
The printer mechanism (10) of claim 1 wherein the ink density sensing
mechanism (16) includes a densitometer.
The printer mechanism (10) of claim 1 wherein the ink density sensing
mechanism (16) includes a printhead jet firing event counter.

mechanism (16) includes an optical scanner.
