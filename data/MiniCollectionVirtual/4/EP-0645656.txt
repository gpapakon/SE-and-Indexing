<ABSTRACT>
A device for forming an entry into a sleeve, comprising at 
least one divided end member, which, in the closed position, 

carries seals and strain relief elements for incoming cables, 
especially glass fibre cables, and which is fastened to the 

sleeve by means of a quick-action band clamp. Each end element 
(4a, 4b) of the member has half housings (7) for receiving 

seals (8) and strain relief elements (9), which end elements 
face towards a dividing plane (5) and can be joined to one 

another when the end member is closed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for forming an entry into a 
sleeve body, especially a butt closure formed for example using 
a dome ended sleeve, comprising at least one divided end, or 
base, member which, in the closed position, carries seals and 
strain relief elements for incoming cables, especially glass 
fibre cables, and which can be fastened to the sleeve body by 
means of a quick action band clamp or the like. Sleeve bodies of the generic kind serve to form branches, 
distributions and the like in data-transmission networks in 
which, apart from the multi-conductor cables which have long 
been known, coaxial cables and, to an increasing extent, also 
glass fibre cables are used. One problem with the sleeves is 
that the sleeve housings are normally comparatively easy to 
seal, especially against the ingress of moisture, but the cable 
entries into the sleeve body present a greater problem and, in 
that connection, therefore, a great many solutions have already 
been described in the literature. By means of shrink technology it is possible to afford sealing 
and strain relief by shrinkable cable entry elements. There may 
be mentioned here, merely by way of example, DE-C-36 07 355, 
EP-A-0 068 781 or EP-A-0 094 848. Cable entries sealed by means 
of sealing rings are disclosed in US-4 424 412 whereas, for 
example, DE-A-40 29 082 discloses a sleeve entry with sealing 
and strain relief provided by means of a central body. End members consisting of very thick material and formed by 
actual sealing elements are disclosed in DE-U-77 25 372 or DE-A-33 
20 916. A divided end plate with strain relief elements 
and seals by means of shrink technology is disclosed in DE-B-24  
 
21 815, and a similar solution in DE-A-29 47 139, while 
modified sealing bodies are shown in DE-A-24 27 677, DE-C-25 15 
939 or DE-A-41 42 586. The wealth of different, known solutions demonstrates how great 
is the value placed on the sealing of the cable entries in such 
sleeve bodies. The problem of the invention is to provide a solution which, 
while offering the possibility of easy mounting, makes possible 
both adaptation to different cable diameters and use with 
different types of cable, i.e. irrespective of whether the 
cables consist of bunches of conductors, are coaxial cables or 
are glass fibre cables. Using a device of the kind described at the beginning, that 
problem is solved according to the invention by means of the 
fact that each end face element is equipped, preferably 
integrally, with half (etc.)

<CLAIMS>
Device for forming an entry into a housing, comprising at 
least one end member divided along a dividing plane into 

end elements and which carries seals and strain relief 
elements for incoming cables, and which can be fastened 

to the housing, characterised in that each end element 
(4a, 4b) has housing (7) elements for receiving a seal 

(8) and strain relief elements (9), and in that a housing 
element on each end element faces towards the dividing 

plain (5) and in that this opposing housing elements can 
be maintained together when the end elements are closed 

together. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
end elements (4a, 4b) are provided with through-bores 

(13), wherein a housing element (14) for receiving the 
seals and strain relief elements is assigned to each 

through-bore (13), and the housing elements (14) can be 
combined with further housing elements (16), which can be 

fixed to them, to form complete cable entries. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the housing elements (7, 14) project from the end 

elements (4a, 4b). 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the further housing elements (16) are pivotally mounted 

on the housing elements. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the housing elements (7, 14, 16) 

have tapered protrusions (10) which can cooperate with 
clamping wedges (11) to hold the housing elements 

together. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 
comprising two end elements, characterised in that the 

end elements (4a, 4b) are of substantially identical 
construction. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that at least one end element (4a or 4b) 

is provided with means (17) allowing electrical earthing 
to be made.
