<ABSTRACT>
A discharging furnace (4) and a filling furnace (3) 
are disposed in the upper and lower parts of a filling 

and discharging furnace (2). The discharging furnace 
has a reservoir (5), with a sloping bottom surface 

protruding toward the filling furnace and provided with 
a valve (9). Hot air heated by a duct heater (18) 

through a duct (16) is fed mainly into the discharging 
furnace while a remaining portion of the hot air is fed 

into the filling furnace. In the discharging furnace 
molten filling material from a bent (worked) workpiece 

(6) is collected in the reservoir and, when the valve is 
opened, is introduced into a straight (unworked) 

workpiece (1) which is carried by a filling carrier (12) 
in the filling furnace. The filling carrier is divided 

into three parts comprising a filling deck (30), a 
carrier body (31) and a sealing deck (32), the filling 

deck (30) having a nozzle (52) and the sealing deck a 
seal member (60). When the sealing deck (32) is moved 

upwards, a workpiece lifting deck (38) is also moved up 
to a condition in which the seal member is engaged with 

the lower end of the unworked workpiece, and the top end 
of the latter engages with the nozzle. The filling 

material is now be filled through the nozzle into the 
workpiece. If the specification of the workpiece 1 is 

changed, the nozzle and the seal member are replaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of treating a tubular workpiece by 
bending it while it contains a filling material and an apparatus 
for filling and discharging a molten filling material of 
low melting point into and out of a tubular workpiece as disclosed in 
GB-A-564623. When it is required to bend a tubular workpiece, 
a filling material of low melting point is 
introduced into the straight tubular workpiece to enable 
it to be bent with accuracy. However, conventionally 
the steps of filling the filling material into the 
straight workpiece, bending the workpiece and then 
heating the same to melt and discharge the filling 
material have been carried out at different locations. Consequently, the filling material, once melted and 
discharged, has to be kept in a heated reservoir and 
then delivered to the straight workpiece by means of a 
pump. Also, generally, the straight workpiece is 
supported by a carrier which is provided with a nozzle 
adapted to engage with the upper end portion of the 
workpiece for filling the filling material therein to, 
whilst a sealing member engages with the lower end of 
the workpiece. Thus, since each of the steps of filling, and 
melting and discharging the filling material, are 
carried out at different places, making it necessary to 
have a heated reservoir for the discharged molten 
filling material, a large working space is needed, 
together with energy for keeping hot a large quantity of 
filling material. Further, it takes a comparatively 
long time to finish a series of workpieces. It is 
therefore desired not only to decrease the working 
space, but also to improve the working efficiency.  
 Still further, since the aforementioned nozzle and 
sealing member can only be used for one specification of 
the workpiece, relative to its length and inner and 
outer diameters, it becomes necessary to reassemble the 
carrier whenever the specification of the workpiece is 
changed, and this is clearly inconvenient. It is 
therefore desired to provide for such changes in the 
specification of the workpiece in more efficient manner. Viewed from one aspect the present invention 
provides a method of treating a tubular workpiece by 
bending it while it contains a filling material, 
comprising the steps of: 
introducing the molten filling material from a 
reservoir into a tubular workpiece; then bending the workpiece to bring it to a bent 
condition; and then heating the workpiece to melt and discharge 
the filling material; 
   characterised in that there is provided
