<ABSTRACT>
The leak rate of the primary buffer in a desynchroniser buffer at the exit 
from a synchronous transport network to a plesiochronous tributary is 

controlled in a manner such that the absolute rate of change of leak rate 
is maintained substantially constant during the periods in which the leak 

rate is increased or decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for controlling leakage of a pointer for a
pointer justification event (PJE) at the exit from a synchronous transport
network to a plesiochronous tributary when video services are carried on
the synchronous network.Broadcast television services have been carried over 140Mbit digital line
systems based on the plesiochronous hierarchy. Line transmission may
be optical or electrical using the coded mark inversion (CMI) coding
scheme on electrical interfaces, and a variety of proprietary schemes
over optical links. Standardisation of the optical interfaces led to first the
Synchronous Optical Network standard (SONET) in America and followed
by the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) in the rest of the world. This
SDH standard provides an interface to all the previous plesiochronous
digital line rates including the 140Mbit system used for broadcast video.As the new standard becomes widely deployed, increasing numbers of
optical transport services at 140Mbit will be carried entirely or in part over
155Mbit synchronous optical links. The mechanism of justifying frequency
offsets within the SDH network introduces phase quanta at the point of
exit for the 140Mbit signal. Where this 140Mbit line is carrying video
services, excessive phase disturbance during justification events have
been found to compromise colour sub carrier jitter standards.The synchronous system allows for the transport of information in a frame
comprising of a fixed number of rows and columns, and some bytes used 
for identifying the position of the information. The information is mapped
into a container and overhead bytes are added to carry quality of signal,
signal type, and other information which is carried with the payload until
the point where it is extracted from the container. The container with its
path overhead (POH) is called a virtual container, and in the case of a
140Mbit signal this is level 4 within the hierarchy. Thus 140Mbit
information is transported across the synchronous network in VC4s.A VC4 is created at the point of entry into the SDH network, and is
preserved until the point of exit where the information is extracted, or
desynchronised. The VC4 may pass through many optical or electrical
spans between multiplexers in the network, but the VC4 payload will not
be operated on at these nodes, only at the point of entry and exit. The
route between these endpoints is referred to as the path. The spans
between nodes are referred to as multiplexer sections. The frames
carried between

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for desynchronising pointer information contained in
a signal at the exit from a synchronous transport network to a

plesiochronous tributary by controlling the leak rate of a primary
buffer (101) in which the pointer information is temporarily stored, the

signal within the synchronous network being transported as
information bits in virtual containers disposed in frames, and each

said virtual container being identified within its frame by a respective
pointer; 
characterised in that
 the arrangement includes;

a register (200) arranged to determine and hold a value dependant
on the rate of arrival of pointer justification events (PJE) in the

desynchroniser and the number of pointer justification events in the
desynchroniser buffer;
a lookup table (204) holding predetermined values defining control
waveforms for controlling the rate at which the register value is

incremented or decremented;
clock controlled counting means (201) adapted to decrement the
register value at a rate determined by the control waveform output

from the lookup table in response to the rate of change of arrival of
the pointer justification events;
and leak buffer control means (102) responsive to the counter output
whereby to generate a clock control for the buffer in the

desynchroniser.

characterised in that
 a demapper(100)

rmation bits from the
synchronous network to the buffer (101) at a rate determined by a

first clock, the fill of the buffer having irregular framing gaps and
displacements corresponding to incoming pointer events, and that the

leak control means (102) is arranged to derive a second variable rate
clock whose successive periods comprise successive time intervals

stored in the lookup table whereby said information bits are leaked
from said buffer into a secondary buffer (103) at a variable rate

controlled by said second clock.

 the
secondary buffer constitutes part of an analogue phase locked loop

line rate clock.
