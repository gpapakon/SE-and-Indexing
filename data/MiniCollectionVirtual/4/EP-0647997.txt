<ABSTRACT>
A casing for through cables particularly for mounting on electric 
panel boards, comprising a casing real and proper (1) able to be fastened 

to a frame (3), fastened in its turn in correspondence with an opening 
made in a wall of the panel board, the casing real and proper (1) 

comprising two half cheeks (6) provided with reciprocal hooking means (13, 
14) and with elastic tabs (8) for blocking the cables (9), and two 

protective outer half shells (7), housing the said half cheeks (6) and 
able to be fastened to each other by means of screws (23). Such casing 

allows the half cheeks (6) to be preassembled with the cables (9), and 
then the mounting of the protective outer half shells (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a casing for through cables to be mounted 
in particular onto electric panel boards, which usually accompany operator 
machine tools, such as printers, electronic devices etc., in which the 
cables must not be sectionized. As is known, at present electric panel boards are already provided with 
openings, in correspondence with which standardized multipolar connectors 
are fixed, into which the cables are sectionized. If such openings do not have to be used they are closed with suitable 
plates. A proposal has also been made to position casings for through cables in 
correspondence with such openings, whose task is to allow the passage of 
cables which must not be sectionized, holding them blocked in position. For this purpose a frame is used fixed in correspondence with the opening, 
provided with hooking means for a casing for the passage of cables which 
substantially has the same configuration as the multipolar connectors.  
 The casings for through cables proposed, however, are complicated 
structurally and not easy to assemble and mount. In addition, the 
preparation for the passage of the cable or cables in them is carried out 
by working in rather precarious conditions, supporting the whole casing, 
which is fairly heavy, since it has an outer metallic covering. An example of a prior art casing for through cables is disclosed in EP-A-430016. The aim of the invention is to eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks by 
providing a casing for through cables, which is easy to realize and allows 
the cable chock part real and proper to be preassembled in extremely easy 
conditions, and the protective outer casing to be mounted afterwards. This aim is achieved with the casing for through cables according to the 
invention, which comprises two inner half cheeks, conveniently of plastic 
material, perfectly equal to each other, comprising means for reciprocal 
fixing and clamping of the cables, and two protective outer half shells, 
conveniently of metallic material, these also being substantially equal to 
each other and each being suitable for housing a respective half cheek, 
fixing being carried out by means of screws which engage the two outer 
half shells between them. The said cable clamping means conveniently consist of pairs of tabs 
diverging in opposite directions, which close elastically onto the cable, 
pressing on it, with the help also of corresponding teeth foreseen inside 
the corresponding protective half shell.  
 Each outer half shell has a pair of pins

<CLAIMS>
A casing for through cables, particularly for mounting on 
electric panel boards, comprising a frame (3) fixed in correspondence with 

an opening of a wall (2) of the board, and a casing real and proper (1) 
able to be fixed to the f
rame (3) and provided with means for the passage 
and blocking of the cables 9, characterized in that the said casing (1) 

comprises a pair of half cheeks (6) provided with reciprocal hooking means 
(13, 14) and with opposed elastic tabs (8) for clamping the cables (9) and 

a pair of protective outer half shells (7), housing the said half cheeks 
(6) and able to be fastened to each other, by the coupling together of the 

said half cheeks (6), at the two opposed sides of the casing, determining 
respective holes (15), (16) for the passage of the cables (9). 
A casing according to claim 1, characterized in that the said 
elastic tabs (8) foreseen inside each half cheek (6) are arranged in pairs 

inclined in opposite directions. 
A casing according to claim 2, characterized in that inside each 
half shell (7) rigid protruding teeth are foreseen acting as abutment 

elements for respective elastic tabs (8).  
 
A casing according to claim 1, characterized in that the said 
engaging means foreseen on the half cheeks (6) consist of elastic teeth 

(13) and corresponding holes (14). 
A casing according to claim 1, characterized in that the said 
hole (16) is an oval hole elongated in the longitudinal direction of the 

cable chock, and houses a sealing gasket (17), having removable discs (18) 
and breakage lines (19) for easing the insertion of the cables (9). 
A casing according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that the said inner half cheeks (6) are perfectly equal 

to each other and the said outer half shells (7) are substantially equal 
to each other. 
A casing according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that the said half cheeks (6) are of plastic material 

and the said half shells (7) of metallic material. 
A casing according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
fastening of the casing (1) to the frame (3) is carried out by the 

engagement of cam hooks (4) hinged to the frame (3) with pins (5) 
projecting outwards from the half shells (7) of the casing (1).  

 
A casing according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized in that it allows preassembling of the half cheeks (6) with 

the through cables and mounting of the outer half shells (7) afterwards.
