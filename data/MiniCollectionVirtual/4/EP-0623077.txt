<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a suspension system for
a vehicle and, more particularly, to a suspension
system which can enhance running safety, cornering
safety and riding comfort by optimally controlling the
change of a camber in accordance with a vehicle's
travelling conditions.In general, a suspension for a vehicle connects
an axle shaft and a vehicle body to each other and
absorbs impact and vibration from a road surface to
increase riding comfort and running safety. To absorb
the impact from the road surface, a connection of upper
and lower parts of the suspension system should be
flexible, and to cope with driving a braking force is
applied to a wheel and centrifugal force in vehicle
turning, a connection in the horizontal direction of the
suspension system should be durable.The suspension system is structurally
characterised as an integral shaft suspension and an
independent suspension. The suspension of this
invention concerns an independent suspension. There are
MacPherson strut type and Wishbone type suspension
systems in the independent suspension. The MacPherson strut type suspension system
comprises a strut assembly 105, shock absorbing means,
consisting of a shock absorber 101 and a spring 102 and
having a lower end fixed to a wheel carrier 103
pivotally supporting a wheel 100 and an upper end
supporting a vehicle body 104; and a lower control arm
106 connecting a lower side of the wheel carrier 103 to
a lower side of the vehicle body 104, as shown in Figure
9a.The range of the wheel up-and-down movement is
determined by the lower control arm 106 during a wheel
up-and-down vibration. The vibration is absorbed by an
elastic bushing of a vehicle body-side connecting
portion. Impact from a road surface is absorbed by the
shock absorber 101 and spring 102 of the strut assembly
105.However, considering operation steps of the
above-described suspension system, when the wheel 100
vibrates upward and downward in accordance with
travelling conditions, the wheel 100 moves upwards and
downward in a state where the length of the lower
control arm 106 is predetermined. Thus, the wheel 100
moves upward and downward according to a tracing
movement M which is formed by the length of lower
control arm 106. A camber angle is changed according to
the wheel up-and-down movement and has a great effect on 
ride comfort, cornering safety, and running stability.That is, since the wheel-side end connecting
portion of the lower arm 56 is designed to be disposed
at a lower side of the wheel centre, when the wheel
moves

<CLAIMS>
A suspension system for a vehicle, the vehicle having a front side, a rear
side, a left side, a ri
ght side and a longitudinal axis, the rear suspension
comprising a wheel carrier (13;4) for supporting a wheel and connected with

a vehicle body (15) for movement with respect therto, and a lower control
arm (2; 6) connecting a lower side of the wheel carrier to the vehicle body

for guiding up-and-down movement of the wheel; and camber control means
(3; 7) for maintaining a camber angle in a negative(-) state, and characterised

in that said camber control means comprises a rotating arm (30, 7) which is
pivotally connected to the vehicle body at a hinge portion (301) and wherein

the rotating arm comprises an horizontal arm (303) projecting outwardly
from the hinge portion, and a vertical arm (302) projecting downwardly from

the hinge portion and engageable with the lower control arm, the hinge
portion being fixed on the vehicle body above the vehicle body-side

connecting portion of the lower control arm and in which a connecting means
(31; 73) is provided for transmitting movement of the wheel to the horizontal

arm to rotate the rotating arm and thereby cause the vertical arm to displace
the lower control arm outwardly according to an ascending operation of the

wheel carrier when the wheel ascends over normal section by a vibration
applied from a road surface.
A suspension system as claimed in claim 1 in which the rear
suspension further comprises a strut assembly (1) including a shock absorber

(11) and a spring (12) and having a lower end connected with the 
wheel carrier and an upper end connected with the vehicle body.
A suspension system as claimed in claim 2, and wherein the
connecting means comprises a connecting rod (31) including an upper end

pivotally connected with a front end of the horizonal arm and a lower end
pivotally connected with a bracket (311) formed on a lower-inner side of the

strut assembly, and an eccentric rubber hush (32) inserted into a vehicle
body-side connection portion of the lower control arm.
A suspension system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the vertical
arm (302) is formed in an arc-shape with a predetermined curvature, a

middle portion of the vertical arm being curved to the vehicle body-side.

spring characteristic in a normal vibration section of
the wheel and receiving a pushing force when the lower

control arm is pushed outward.
A suspension system as claimed in claim 5,
