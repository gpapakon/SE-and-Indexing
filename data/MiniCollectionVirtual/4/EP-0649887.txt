<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to compositions 
that are useful for forming a water-repellent coating on a 
substrate and more particularly to such compositions wherein the 
coatings formed therefrom also exhibit antiseptic properties. Various compositions adapted for forming water-repellent 
coatings on various substrates are disclosed in JP 
(Kokai) 48-39382, JP (Kokai) 3-215570, and JP (Kokai) 3-244996. JP (Kokai) 48-39382 teaches the formation of a 
hydrophobic fine powder layer (having an average particle size 5-10 
µm) on the substrate surface which utilizes (a) fine water 
droplets (having an average size below 2 µm) and (b) hydrophobic 
material of contact angle greater than 90°. JP (Kokai) 3-215570 discloses a water-repellent paint 
that includes (a) hydrophobic fine powder having a surface 
tension less than 32 dyne/cm and (b) a resin having a water 
absorbing capacity less than 0.5 % selected from the group 
consisting of silicone resin, fluororesin, polyethersulfone 
resin, polyphenylenesulfide resin, acrylic resin, epoxy resin, 
polyimide resin and admixtures thereof. JP (Kokai) 3-244996 discloses a water-repellent coating 
composition including (a) inorganic or organic powder having a  
 
porous structure and a particle size less than 4 µm, and (b) a 
silicone or fluorine containing resin compound. Each of the prior art references teaches the use of 
compositions including (a) particulate filler material and (b) a 
hydrophobic binder. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a composition for forming a water-repellant coating on a 
substrate, which composition does not require the use of a water-repellant 
binder. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a composition for forming a water-repellant coating which 
also exhibits antiseptic characteristics. The present invention is set forth in its entirety in 
Japanese Patent Application No. 05-287487(93), filed on 
October 22, 1993 and incorporated in its entirety herein by 
reference. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided a composition for forming a water-repellent and 
antiseptic coating on a substrate, the composition comprising: 
(a) 15-75 weight % of hydrophobicizing filler;
 
   said hydrophobicizing filler being a filler material reacted 
with an organic group-containing hydrophobicizing agent;
 
   said hydrophobicizing filler having a hydrophobicized ratio, 
S, associated therewith;
 
 
   said hydrophobicized ratio, S, being greater than about 2.7 
weight %; and
