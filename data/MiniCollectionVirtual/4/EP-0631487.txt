<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the general field of
surgical instruments and relates specifically to proximal
end fittings. These fittings are used with catheter
guidewire assemblies in cardiovascular and endovascular
procedures to facilitate the placement of catheters
within the vasculature of patients.The general procedure for placing catheters
within vessels is to track a guidewire through the vessel
to the desired position and advance the catheter over the
guidewire. Guidewires are required because the catheters
themselves do not have sufficient column strength or
torqueability to be able to be tracked or steered through
the vessel. See, for instance, U.S. Patent No.
4,884,579.Normally, blood pressure within a catheter
guidewire assembly is controlled by a compression ring
seal made out of rubber or rubber-like material. This
method restricts wire movement when the seal is too tight
and is inefficient when the seal is too loose. The
purpose of the present invention, therefore is to
control blood reflux into the catheter while the catheter
is being positioned at a predetermined vessel site
without impeding guidewire movement. When the device is 
used in conjunction with a compression ring seal, the
guidewire can be captured and higher pressure can be
controlled. When the compression ring is released, the
guidewire movement is unrestricted.EP-A-0 440 426 discloses a hemostatic sleeve for use
with a catheter. The term "catheter" in this reference
is said to be read as embracing both a guidewire and a
probe. The device includes a sleeve for assembly on to
the shaft of the catheter, between the catheter shaft and
a Tuohy-Borst connector. The internal diameter of the
sleeve is complementary with the external diameter of the
catheter, so that the catheter is movable within the
sleeve and so as to provide an annular space about the
catheter whereby, in use, a controlled amount of
backbleed of blood is allowed. The external diameter of
the sleeve is such that when the Tuohy-Borst connector is
closed, a seal is formed between the sleeve and the
connector. A seal is provided about the external surface
of the sleeve to cooperate with the internal surface of
the connector so as to eliminate blood flow.According to the present invention there is provided
a proximal end fitting for use with a catheter and a
guidewire to form a catheter guidewire assembly, the
proximal end fitting comprising:
(a) a tubular body having a proximal end and a
distal end and a lumen extending between said ends for
the guidewire of said assembly
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A proximal end fitting (13) for use with a
catheter (12) and a guidewire (11) to form a catheter

guidewire assembly, the proximal end fitting (13)
comprising:


(a) a tubular body (28) having a proximal end (29)
and a distal end (30) and a lumen (31) extending between

said ends for the guidewire (11) of said assembly to
extend through in use;
(b) means (15) at said distal end (30) for
sealingly receiving the proximal end (27) of the catheter

(12) of said assembly in use;
(c) a compressible O-ring (38) positioned within
the lumen (31);
(d) axially movable means (36) received within the
proximal end (29) of the body (28) for compressing the O-ring

(38) to form a seal about the guidewire (11) in use;
and
(e) an elongated radially compressible plastic tube
(37) extending distally from the axially movable means

(36) through said O-ring (38) and a substantial portion
of said lumen to be, in use, coaxial with the guidewire

(11), said plastic tube (37) facilitating said seal.
The proximal end fitting of claim 1, wherein
the axially movable means comprises an end cap (36) with

a threaded connection and the proximal end (29) of the
body (28) comprises a threaded connection such that the

threaded connection at the proximal end of the body is
sealingly received within the threaded end cap.
The proximal end fitting of claim 2, wherein
the end cap (36) further comprises a central tubular

shaft (39) with a lumen, through which lumen the
elongated radially compressible plastic tube (37) is

attached, a first collar (40) concentrically surrounding 
the central tubular shaft (39) with a smooth
 outer
surface and a threaded inner surface to sealingly receive

the threaded proximal end (29) of the body (28), and a
second collar (41) concentrically surrounding said

central tubular shaft and said first collar (40) with a
smooth inner surface and a ribbed outer surface for

gripping the end cap.
The proximal end fitting of claim 3, wherein
the O-ring (38) is positioned at the proximal end of the

tubular body lumen such that when the end cap (36) is
threadedly connected to the proximal end of the tubular

body, the O-ring is sealingly compressed about the
plastic tube (37).
The proximal end fitting of claim 4, wherein
the outer diameter of the radially compressible plastic

tube (37) is such as to facilitate a seal between the
tube and the O-ring (38) when the end cap (36) is

threadedly connected to the proximal end (29) of the
tubular body (28).
The proximal end fitting of any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the tubular body lumen has an

overall length of between about 4 and 6 cm, an inner
diameter of between about 0.38 and 0.39 mm and an outer

diameter of between about 1.4 and 1.6 mm.
The proximal end fitting of any one of the
preceding claims, which further comprises a side port

(32) for the introduction of fluid material.
The proximal end fitting of any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the elongated radially

compressible tube (37) comprises an inner layer of
polypropylene and an outer layer of polyethylene.
