<CLAIMS>
Use of derivatives of beta-naphthoquinone of general
formula (I):



in which R represents a group of formula -NH-CO-NH
2
, or a
group of formula -NH-CO-CH
3
 or a hydroxyl group, as well as
their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral

or organic acids, for the production of a medicament allowing
the inhibition of platelet aggregation for the treatment or

the prevention of ischemic complications, in the treatment of
platelet disorders.
Use according to claim 1, characterized in that the
derivative of beta-naphthoquinone is a product of general

formula (I) in which R represents a group of formula
-NH-CO-NH
2
, as well as its addition salts with
pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids.
Use according to claim 1, characterized in that the
derivative of beta-naphthoquinone is a product of general

formula (I) in which R represents a group of formula
-NH-CO-CH
3
, as well as its addition salts with
pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids.
Use according to claim 1, characterized in that the
derivative of beta-naphthoquinone is a product of general

formula (I) in which R represents a hydroxy group, as well as 
its addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral

or organic acids.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
derivative of beta-naphthoquinone is 1,2-naphtoquinone 2-semicarbazone.
