<ABSTRACT>
A resin composition consisting essentially of 
(a) an aromatic polycarbonate resin, (b) a 

thermoplastic graft copolymer obtained by grafting a 
diene rubber component with a vinyl cyanide compound 

and an aromatic vinyl compound, (c) a phosphoric acid 
ester, (d) a polytetrafluoroethylene, (e) a scaly 

inorganic filler, and (f) a composite rubber having a 
network structure in which a polyorganosiloxane rubber 

component and a polyalkyl (meth)acrylate rubber 
component interpenetrate each other, each in a 

specified amount. This resin composition has excellent 
fluidity and allows easy mold- processing. The molded 

article made therefrom is excellent in flame 
retardancy, stiffness, heat-resistance, impact strength 

and appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame-retardant
resin composition and a molded article made
therefrom. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a flame-retardant resin composition superior
in stiffness, fluidity and impact resistance, which
comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin and an ABS
resin as the main components, a phosphoric acid ester
and a polytetrafluoroethylene as the flame-retardant
components, a specific inorganic filler and a specific
composite rubber; and to a molded article made therefrom.Molded articles made from aromatic
polycarbonate resins are superior in mechanical
properties and thermal properties and hence, are widely
used in industrial fields. They, however, are inferior
in processability and moldability. In order to
alleviate this problem, a number of polymer alloys
between polycarbonate resin and other thermoplastic
resin have been developed. Among them, polymer alloys
between polycarbonate resin and ABS resin are in wide
use in automobiles, apparatuses for office automation,
electronic and electric fields, etc. Meanwhile, there
have recently been a strong demand for the resin
materials having flame retardancy, used in apparatuses
for office automation, electric appliances for
household use, etc. To meet this demand a number of
proposals have been made as well for polymer alloys
between polycarbonate resin and ABS resin, in order to
impart flame retardancy to the alloys.In imparting flame retardancy to an aromatic
polycarbonate resin or a polymer alloy thereof, it was
a general practice to add a bromine-containing halogen-based 
flame retardant and an auxiliary flame retardant
such as antimony trioxide in combination. This
approach, however, generates harmful substance(s) when
the resulting resin or polymer alloy burns. Hence, use
of a compound other than the bromine-containing halogen
type compound has been studied actively. For example,
combination use of a phosphoric acid ester and a
polytetrafluoroethylene having a fibril formability has
been studied.The following proposals were made on, for
example, aromatic polycarbonate resin compositions
using a phosphoric acid ester as a flame retardant.
