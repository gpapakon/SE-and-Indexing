<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a windscreen wiper (10), especially for a motor vehicle, of the type including a windscreen wiper arm (12) which has at least one wiper blade and which is mounted articulated about an articulation axis (X-X) on a drive head (16) of the windscreen wiper arm (12), at least one spring (18) arranged between the drive head (16) and the windscreen wiper arm (12) which applies to the latter (12) a force whose support straight line (D) is not concurrent with the axis of articulation (X-X) so as to apply to the windscreen wiper arm (12) a wiping torque, and means for causing the distance (d) between the support straight line (D) of the force and the axis of articulation (X-X) to vary, characterised in that the said means cause the position of the articulation axis (X-X) relative to the drive head (16) to vary.

<CLAIMS>
A screen wiper (10), especially for a motor
vehicle, of the type comprising a screen wiper arm (12)

which carries at least one wiper blade and which is
articulated, about a pivot axis (X-X), on a drive head

(16) of the wiper arm (12), at least one spring (18)
arranged between the drive head (16) and the wiper arm

(12), which applies to the latter (12) a force the line
of action (D) of which is not coincident with the pivot

axis (X-X), whereby to apply a wiping torque to the
wiper arm (12), and of the type including means for

varying the distance (d) between the line of action (D)
of the force and the pivot axis (X-X), characterised in

that it includes an actuator (60), the body (62) of
which is associated with the drive head (16), with the

output member (52, 56, 58) of the actuator varying the
position of the pivot axis (X-X) with respect to the

drive head (16).
A screen wiper according to Claim 1, characterised
in that a first end (20) of the spring (18) is

connected at a point (22) on the screen wiper arm (12),
and in that the second end (24) of the spring (18) is

connected to the drive head (16, 32).
A screen wiper according to Claim 1, characterised
in that it includes an actuating rocker (38) which is

mounted for rotation on the drive head (16) about a
rocking axis (T-T) parallel to the pivot axis (X-X) of

the screen wiper arm (12), and which has a first branch
(40) connected to the output member (56, 58) of the 

actuator (60), and a second branch (42) which carries
the pivot axis (X-X) of the wiper arm (12).
A screen wiper according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the actuator (60) is a linear motor having an

output member (52) which is displaceable in a direction
(A) at right angles to the pivot axis (X-X) and the

rocking axis (T-T), with its free end (50) being
connected to the first branch (40) of the actuating

rocker (38).
A screen wiper according to Claim 4, characterised
in that the first branch (40) of the rocker includes an

actuating cam profile (48) with which there cooperates
a cam follower element (50) arranged at the free end of

the output member (52) of the actuator (60).
A screen wiper according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the cam profile is a slot (48) formed in the

first branch (40) of the actuating rocker (38), in
which there is received an actuating finger (50) fixed

to the free end of the output member (52) of the
actuator (60).
A screen wiper according to Claim 5 or Claim 6,
characterised in that the cam profile (48) has two end

portions (66, 70), each of which is associated with one
extreme position of the rocker (38) with respect to the

drive head (16), and a connecting portion (64).
A screen wiper according to Claim 7, characterised
in that each end portion is a straight portion which,

when the rocker occupies the extreme position
associated with that end portion, extends parallel to 

the direction (A) of displacement of the output rod

(58) of the actuator (60).
A screen wiper according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the spring (18)

is a helical tension spring.
