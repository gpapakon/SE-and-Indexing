<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for delivering a cryogen in which a cryogen is stored 
and delivered in a cryogenic storage facility having three tanks (12,14,16). 

Each of the 
tanks is filled with the cryogen in a subcooled liquid state to wash 

contaminants 
down toward a bottom region thereof. Thereafter, a minor stream composed of 

superheated vapour is introduced into the bottom region of each tank to 
pressurise each tank. A major stream of the superheated vapour is then 

introduced into each tank to form scrubbed cryogenic vapour in the head space 
region thereof which is used in forming the product stream. Each tank is 

subsequently used to dispense the cryogen to a vaporiser (102,104,106) 
to form the 

superheated vapour which is in turn divided into the major and subsidiary 
streams. The foregoing operations are preferably conducted the three tanks as 

an out of phase cycle such that one tank dispenses the liquid cryogen to the 
remaining tanks as the major and subsidiary streams and after having dispensed 

the cryogen, each tank is refilled which again substantially clears the top 
head space region thereof of contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cryogenic storage and delivery apparatus and 
method in which three tanks are used to store a cryogen as a pressurised, 
saturated liquid, to dispense the cryogen as a vapour by vaporising the cryogen 
from the bottom region of one tank and introducing the vaporised cryogen into 
the bottom region of another tank, thereby to produce scrubbed cryogenic 
vapour in the top head space region of such tank, and to form a product stream 
substantially free of contaminants from the scrubbed cryogenic vapour. The 
utilisation of the three tanks takes place in an out of phase cycle designed such 
that the top head space region of each tank is maintained substantially clear of 
contaminants. Liquid cryogen is stored in cryogenic storage facilities consisting of one or more 
tanks from which the cryogen is delivered from each tank upon demand. 
Associated with a tank is a pressure building circuit to build the pressure within 
the tank to a delivery pressure and a heat exchanger, attached to an outlet of 
the tank, to supply the product at ambient temperature. The cryogen is delivered from the tank at a delivery pressure. Hence, when a 
tank is filled, it is necessary to maintain the delivery pressure. This is 
accomplished by alternately filling the tank from top and bottom inlets in the top 
and bottom regions of the tank. This creates a problem due to the fact that 
higher boiling contaminants such as moisture solidify on the walls of the tank 
and airborne dust drawn in during the filling of the tank also is deposited on the 
walls of the tank. Thus, after a filling of the tank, the product is initially 
delivered with a high concentration of the contaminants. This problem is 
exacerbated due to the pressure building circuit which draws off cryogen from 
the bottom of the tank and returns cryogenic vapour along with contaminants to 
the top region of the tank, the region where the cryogen is delivered. In order 
to solve the contaminant problem it has been known to employ either a tank  
 
within a tank or two tanks in which cryogenic vapour from one tank is bubbled 
through the bottom of another tank in order to solidify the contaminants prior to 
delivery of a cryogenic liquid or to purify cryogenic vapour prior to delivery. See 
for instance, U.S. 3,798,918 and U.S. 4,579,566. Another problem involved in the storage and delivery of the cryogen is that the 
physical properties of the cryogen are not uniform. The reason for such 
non-uniformity is that the cryogen is
