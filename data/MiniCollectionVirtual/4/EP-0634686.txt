<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus, and various accompanying methods, 
for use in a photographic camera for selecting a lens 

aperture setting and/or flash output configuration for a 
full flash exposure. Specifically, the lens aperture 

setting and/or flash output configuration are selected 
based upon a difference existing between a first 

parameter, i.e. a guide number, that indicates the amount 
of output power that the flash is capable of producing 

and a second parameter, i.e. a depth number, that 
indicates the amount of flash illumination required to 

photograph a scene with a pre-defined depth-of-illumination 
about a subject situated therein. The flash 

output configuration can be a spread flash with a 
selected one of a number of different spread angles, a 

bounce flash or, if the flash unit is an energy saving 
type, a reduction in (throttling back) the flash output 

power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus, and 
various accompanying methods, for use in a photographic 
camera for improving the overall quality of photographed 
images, i.e. increasing the number of acceptable and 
higher quality images, that are produced by the camera. 
The quality improvement is attained by automatically 
selecting the values of various photographic exposure 
parameters (exposure settings and, where appropriate, 
flash parameters) based upon scene requirements 
(including providing sufficient depth-of-field and 
avoiding image blur) and film quality characteristics, 
and, where appropriate, deviating from the corresponding 
exposure values dictated by adherence to the ISO/ANSI 
exposure standards. Photographic cameras have been in widespread 
use for quite some time. Basically, such a camera 
operates by exposing a portion of a light sensitive 
media, i.e. a frame of film, for a pre-defined period of 
time to scene illumination. The light is focused on the 
frame through a lens that has an aperture of a given, 
often variable, size. A shutter, situated behind the lens 
and in front of the film, opens for a selected period of 
time in order to permit the light to transit 
therethrough, illuminate and expose the film. As a 
result of being properly exposed and subsequently  
 
developed, the film undergoes a photochemical process, on 
a two-dimensional basis throughout the frame, that 
locally varies the optical transmissivity of each portion 
of the frame in proportion to the amount of illumination 
that reaches that portion of the frame from a 
corresponding portion of the scene, thereby producing, 
depending upon whether reversal or negative film is used, 
either a two-dimensional positive or negative optical 
image of the scene. As such, tonal variations that 
appeared in the scene are captured in the frame of the 
film. Photographic prints are often made from negatives, 
while transparencies (commonly referred to as "slides") 
are made from positives. Though this overall process, which relies on 
the use of silver halide as a photosensitive reagent in 
film, has basically remained unchanged over many years, 
this process is highly non-linear and subject to a great 
many variables which significantly complicate its use. 
In particular, exposure (E) is defined, under a 
standardized definition, as being a product of the 
illuminance (I) multiplied by the time (t) during which 
the film is exposed to this illumination. In this 
regard, see specifically ANSI (American National 
Standards
