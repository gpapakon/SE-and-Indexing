<ABSTRACT>
A driving circuit of the invention is used 
for driving a display apparatus including pixels and 

data lines. The display apparatus displays an image 
with multiple gray scales in accordance with video data 

consisting of a plurality of bits. The driving circuit 
includes: an oscillating signal generating section for 

receiving original oscillating signals and for generating 
an oscillating signal T from the original oscillating 

signals in accordance with a value represented by 
bits selected from the bits of the video data; an 

inversion section for producing an oscillating signal 
T-bar by inverting the oscillating signal T; a gray-scale 

voltage specifying section for producing gray-scale 
voltage specifying signals which specify a first 

gray-scale voltage and a second gray-scale voltage 

among a plurality of gray-scale voltages supplied from 
a gray-scale voltage supply section, in accordance with 

video data consisting of bits other than the selected 
bits; and an output section for outputting the specified 

first gray-scale voltage and second gray-scale 
voltage to the data lines, in accordance with the 

oscillating signals T and T-bar. In the driving circuit, 
each original oscillating signal has a first 

level value and a second level value, respective periods 
of the first level value in one cycle being different 

from each other, respective lengths of the periods 
of the first level value in one cycle being weighted in 

accordance with corresponding bits of the video data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving
circuit for a display apparatus. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a driving circuit for
an active matrix type liquid crystal display apparatus
which displays an image with multiple gray scales in
accordance with digital video signals.An active matrix type liquid crystal display
apparatus includes a display panel and a driving circuit
for driving the display panel. The display panel
includes a pair of glass substrates and a liquid crystal
layer formed between the pair of glass substrates.
On one of the pair of glass substrates, a plurality of
gate lines and a plurality of data lines are formed.
The driving circuit is disposed for every data line in
the display panel, and the driving circuit applies a
driving voltage to the liquid crystal layer of the
display panel. The driving circuit includes a gate
driver for selecting a plurality of switching elements
connected to the gate lines and the data lines for
every gate line, and a data driver for supplying a
video signal corresponding to an image to pixel electrodes
via the selected switching elements.Figure 21 shows a configuration for a part of
a data driver in a prior art driving circuit. The
circuit 210 shown in Figure 21 outputs a video signal
to one of a plurality of data lines. Accordingly, the
data driver requires circuits 210 the number of which 
is equal to the number of data lines provided in a
display panel. For simplicity of explanation, it is
herein assumed that video data consists of three bits
(D0, D1, D2). On such an assumption, the video data
may have eight values of 0 to 7, and a signal voltage
supplied to each pixel is one of eight levels V0-V7.The circuit 210 includes a sampling flip-flop
MSMP, a holding flip-flop MH, a decoder DEC, and analog
switches ASW0-ASW7. To each of the analog switches
ASW0-ASW7, a corresponding one of external source
voltages V0-V7 of the respective eight levels which are
different from each other is supplied. In addition, to
the analog switches ASW0-ASW7, control signals S0-S7
are supplied from the decoder DEC, respectively. Each
of the control signals S0-S7 is used for switching the
ON/OFF state of the analog switch.Next, the operation of the circuit 210 is
described. At the rising of a sampling pulse TSMPn
corresponding to the nth pixel, the sampling flip-flop
MSMP gets video data (D0, D1, D2), and holds the video
data therein. When such video data sampling for one
horizontal period is completed, an output pulse signal
OE is applied to the holding
