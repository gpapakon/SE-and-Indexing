<ABSTRACT>
A weft knitted upholstery fabric having an aesthetic 
surface and incorporating a ground yarn (preferably with a 

count between 550 and 900 decitex) and a chenille yarn (1,2,3) 
(preferably having a decitex in the range 2000 to 5000), the 

chenille yarn being knitted into the fabric as full loop 
stitches to leave the chenille yarn evident on the aesthetic 

surface of the fabric.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an upholstery fabric and to a
method of manufacturing an upholstery fabric, and has
particular reference to a fabric having a soft touch or velour
type feel.Woven velour fabrics are well known for upholstering
purposes, particularly for upholstery in motor vehicles such
as cars. Such velour fabrics have an attractive feel and are
regarded as a high quality fabric for use in car upholstery.
A velour fabric is characterised by the fact that it has a
very short pile and has a comparatively soft touch compared
to a conventional woven fabric. The softness of the touch is
associated with a rocking action of the pile when the velour
is stroked or the fingers of a hand are rocked backwards and
forwards on the velour.Velour fabrics were initially produced by forming a
complex weave from two warps which were interconnected by
transverse fibres. On cutting the transverse fibres to
separate the two warps, the remains of the interconnecting
fibres form a short pile which gives the velour its
characteristic feel.More recently, such velour fabrics have been produced
with a nylon or polyester pile by the use of a twin needle bar
Raschel warp knitting machine, again to produce two
interconnected layers of fabric which are sliced apart to
produce two separate velour fabric pieces.With a woven or warp-knitted velour fabric, a seat is
upholstered in a conventional manner by the so-called cut-and-sew 
route. Individual panels of the fabric are cut to shape
out of a piece of fabric and then the panels are sewn together
to produce an upholstery cover. This is positioned over an
upholstery core -typically a foam bun or other suitable core -
to produce the seat.More recently, proposals have been made to produce a
three-dimensional knitted structure whereby a knitted
upholstery fabric can be produced in a shaped form so that the
knitted structure can be used immediately to upholster a core
without need for expensive cutting and sewing operations.
Such three-dimensional knitting of fabric structures for
upholstery is described, for example, in EP-A-0518582, GB-A-2223034,
GB-A-2223035 and GB-A-2223036, the contents of all
of which specifications are incorporated herein by way of
reference. Essentially, all such prior references utilise a
flat V-bed weft knitting machine having a pair of opposed
needle beds, the needles of which may be actuated by a
plurality of cams, in a preferred arrangement under the
control of a computerised cam actuating and needle selection
mechanism.In contrast, EP-A- 0091676

<CLAIMS>
A weft knitted fabric incorporating a ground yarn
(32, 67, 69, A, B) and a chenille yarn (37, 65, Ch) wherein

the chenille yarn and ground yarn are present in the fabric
as full loop stitches,

characterised in that the fabric is an upholstery fabric and each stitch comprises only one of the
chenille yarn and the ground yarn.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that the fabric is a single jersey fabric

and the chenille yarn (37, 65, Ch) has a dtex value in the
range 2000 to 5000.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 1 or 2
characterised in that the ground yarn (32, 67, 69, A, B) is

an air-textured polyester yarn having a dtex value in the
range 550 to 900.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that no chenille yarn stitch has more than

six adjacent chenille stitches in a wale-wise direction.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 1
characterised in that the fabric is a double jersey fabric,

formed of two layers interlinked by mutually engaging
stitches.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 5
characterised in that the chenille yarn (37, 65, Ch) has a

dtex value in the range 1000 to 2500 and the ground yarn (32,
67, 69, A, B) has a dtex value in the range 500 to 800. 
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 6
characterised in that the fabric has 4-7 stitches per cm (10

to 16 stitches per inch) in the course-wise direction and 8-16
stitches (20 to 40 stitches per inch) in the wale-wise

direction.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 7
characterised in that the chenille yarn (37, 65, Ch) has a

yarn to metal coefficient of friction in the range 0.2 to 3
and the ground yarn (32, 67, 69 A, B) is an air textured

polyester yarn having a yarn to metal coefficient of friction
in the range 0.1 to 0.45.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 8
characterised in that the chenille yarn (37, 65, Ch) has an

extensibility in the range 5% to 15% at a load of half the
breaking strain thereof.
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 9
characterised in that the chenille yarn (37, 65 Ch) is formed

of a core of elongate polyester or nylon (1, 2)and low
melting point nylon strands with a polyester pile (3).
A knitted fabric as claimed in claim 10
characterised in that the polyester pile (3) has a fibre

count in the range 1.11 to 4.44 dtex (1 to 4 denier) per
filament and length in the range 1.4mm to 1.75mm.
A knitted fabric as claimed in any one of claims 5
to 11 characterised in that the chenille yarn appears on one

side (37, 73) only of the fabric in any predetermined region 
of the fabric, and in that the yarn count of the chenille

yarn is greater than that of the non-chenille yarn and in
that a greater number of stitches of non-chenille yarn is

provided on the non-chenille side so as to balance the fabric
and produce a substantially non-curling fabric.
A knitted fabric as claimed in any one of claims 2
to 4 characterised by there being in the range 3 to 7 wales

per cm (8 to 16 wales per inch) in a course-wise direction of
the fabric, and in the range 3 to 12 courses per cm (8 to 30

courses per inch) in a wale-wise direction, the chenille yarn
(37, 65, Ch) being knitted into the fabric as knitted looped

stitches, with the aesthetic surface (36, 73) of the fabric
on which the chenille yarn is evident being the technical

reverse side of the fabric.
A method of weft knitting an upholstery fabric on a
machine having a pair of opposed independently operable

needle beds (33, 34) in which the needles in each bed can be
moved independently of one another in that bed into the path

of an operating cam box having double cam system
reciprocatable along the needle beds, said method including

knitting fabric from a chenille yarn (37, 65, Ch) and a non-chenille
ground yarn (32, 67, 69, A, B), characterised in

that the chenille yarn (37, 65, Ch) and ground yarn are
knitted into full loop stitches comprising only one of the

chenille yarn and the ground yarn.
