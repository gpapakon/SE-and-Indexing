<ABSTRACT>
A helical gear fluid machine comprises an inner 
rotary element (14) and an outer rotary element (15) and a 

casing (12), the rotary elements being mounted within the 
casing for rotation about mutually spaced fixed axes 

(17,16). The casing forms stationary inlet and outlet 
chambers (21,24) to the working section of the machine. The 

inner rotary element (14) is only supported for rotation by 
means of the outer rotary element (15) and by means of a 

coupling (28) with the drive shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a helical gear fluid 
machine, such as pump or motor, of the progressive cavity 
type, in which, generally, a rotor of n starts is caused to 
rotate and orbit within the stator of n ± 1 starts. 
Alternatively, it has been suggested in US Patent No. 
1892217 to produce a pump or motor in which the stator, the 
outer element, rotates, rather than being fixed, and forms 
the outer casing of a chamber in which the rotor rotates 
about a fixed axis, and through which the fluid is pumped. The casing of the chamber is supported for 
rotation about its axis by plates forming the inner part of 
the end walls of the chambers at either end of the pump, 
through which fluid passes, on the outside of the pump 
casing. In this suggestion, fluid is admitted to or from 
the casing through these supporting end walls, which are 
shown as the inlet/outlet ducts of the pump. O-rings are 
provided to support the thrust bearings between its supports 
and the casing, to allow for axial misalignment and at the 
entry of the drive shaft for the inner element. Thus, US-A-1892217 discloses a helical gear fluid 
machine comprising a drive shaft; a fixed outer casing, 
having a first drive shaft end and a second end, opposite 
said first drive shaft end; an outer rotary element having a 
female helical gear form of n starts; means supporting said 
outer rotary element for rotation about a first fixed axis 
defined by said fixed outer casing; an inner rotary element 
having a male helical gear form of n ± 1 starts, said inner 
rotary element being rotatable within the outer rotary 
element about a second, fixed axis, said second axis being 
spaced apart from and substantially parallel to the first 
axis, the inner rotary element being only supported for 
rotation by means of the outer rotary element and by means 
of coupling with the drive shaft. The same features are 
disclosed in WO-A-9 308 402 (Fig.23).  
 The present invention is characterised in that 
said outer rotary element comprises an elastomeric material 
body in which said female helical gear form is provided; a 
surrounding tubular metal barrel, and two bearing zones on 
said tubular metal barrel, one at each axial end of said 
outer rotary element, said bearing zones being axially 
spaced from one another; in that an elastomeric material 
bearing member is positioned between said bearing zones of 
said tubular metal barrel and said outer casing, effective 
to provide a radial bearing for said outer rotary element; 
in that an annular radially

annular bearing surface, thereby lubricating said bearing 
zone and said annular radially extending bearing surface.
