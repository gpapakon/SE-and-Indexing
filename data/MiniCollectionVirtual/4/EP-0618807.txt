<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical preparation comprising a growth hormone and histidine or a derivative of histidine as additive or buffering substance shows a very high stability against deamidation, oxidation and cleavage of peptide bonds. The stability of the product allows for the storing and shipment thereof in a lyophilized state or in the form of a dissolved or re-dissolved preparation at ambient temperature. Crystallization of growth hormone in the presence of histidine or a derivative thereof gives rise to a higher yield of crystals having a higher purity than known methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stabilized pharmaceutical
formulation comprising human growth hormone and histidine or a
derivative of histidine, to a method of making such formulation,
crystals of human growth hormone comprising histidine or a
derivative thereof, a method of preparing such crystals and the
use of histidine or derivatives of histidine for stabilizing a
formulation of human growth hormone.The growth hormones (GH) from man and from the common domestic
animals are proteins of approximately 191 amino acids, synthesized
and secreted from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.
Human growth hormone consists of 191 amino acids.Growth hormone is a key hormone involved not only in the regulation of
somatic growth, but also in the regulation of metabolism
of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The major effect of
growth hormone is to promote growth. The organ systems affected by growth hormone include the skeleton,
connective tissue, muscles, and viscera such as liver,
intestine, and kidneys.Until the development of the recombinant technology and the
cloning of the growth hormone gene now giving rise to production
of e.g. human growth hormone (hGH) and Met-hGH on an industrial
scale, human growth hormone could only be obtained by extraction
from the pituitary glands of human cadavers. The very limited
supplies of growth hormone restricted the use thereof to
longitudinal growth promotion in childhood and puberty for
treatment of dwarfism, even though it has been proposed for
inter alia treatment of short stature (due to growth hormone
deficiency, normal short stature and Turner syndrom), growth
hormone deficiency in adults, infertility, treatment of burns,
wound healing, dystrophy, bone knitting, osteoporosis, diffuse
gastric bleeding, and pseudoarthrosis.Furthermore, growth hormone has been proposed for increasing the
rate of growth of domestic animals or for decreasing the
proportion of fat in animals to be slaughtered for human consumption.Pharmaceutical preparations of growth hormone tend to be unstable.
Degradation products such as deamidated or sulfoxydated
products and dimer or polymer forms are generated - especially
in solutions of growth hormone.The predominant degradation reactions of hGH are 1) deamidation
by direct hydrolysis or via a cyclic succinimide intermediate
to form various amounts of L-asp-hGH, L-iso-asp-hGH, D-asp-hGH,
and D-iso-asp-hGH (ref 1-3), 2) oxidation of the methionine
residues in positions 14 and 125 (ref 4-9), and 3) cleavage of 
peptide bonds.Deamidation
