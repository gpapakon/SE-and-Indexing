<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronic carrier pigeon detection system comprising a base device combining a write-read device, a control device and an antenna. Said system makes it possible to use the base device to nest or release the pigeons in the area of operation during registration and to detect pigeons in the pigeon loft during detection.

<CLAIMS>
Electronic verification system for homing pigeons
with a reader which is associated with an antenna and

which reads the identification data from transponders of
foot rings of the pigeons when these are registered in

the deployment location and when these arrive at the
pigeon loft, with a base unit which exhibits a display

and in which a clock is incorporated, for entering the
identification data and for storing all the race data,

whereby the base units of the breeders can be connected
to a computer at the deployment location, and whereby the

base unit has an associated operating unit, 
characterised
in that
 the reader is at the same time a recorder which,
including the antenna, can be detached from the base unit

and, when detached, is connected to the base unit without
any wires, and 
in that
 in place of the recorder/reader, a
keyboard can be inserted in the base unit as operating

unit which, when detached, is also connected to the base
unit without any wires.
Electronic verification system according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the base unit is transportable and
has its own power supply.
Electronic verification system according to claim 1
or 2, 
characterised in that
 a data transmitter which
produces an electrical signal for a receiver when a

pigeon arrives, is connected to the base unit.
Electronic verification system according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 the data transmitter is
incorporated in the base unit. 
Electronic verification system according to claim 3
or 4, 
characterised in that
 the receiver is portable and
produces an optical and/or acoustic signal.
Electronic verification system according to one of
claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the electrical
signal contains the data picked up by the base unit when

a pigeon arrives.
Electronic verification system according to one of
claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the data transmitter
actuates a telephone modem which holds the telephone

number of the deployment location to which the data is
sent.
