<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a simple, efficient
and reliable method of obtaining novel poly(vinyl halide)
resins having reduced molecular weight, low polydispersity,
and good thermal stability by mimicking a "living" radical
polymerization mechanism.The addition of hydrogen iodide to vinyl chloride was
first described by Kharasch and Hannum in an article in
1934. The article, entitled "The Peroxide Effect in the
Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds IV. The
Addition of Halogen Acids to Vinyl Chloride", J. American
Chem. Soc., 56, (1934) p. 712 described the addition of
various halogen acids such as hydrogen iodide to vinyl
chloride. In particular, Kharasch et. al. discuss the
addition of 0.12 moles of hydrogen iodide to 0.1 mole of
vinyl chloride in a reactor. Kharasch et. al. were
studying the effects of peroxides on reactions which occur
via a carbonation process in contrast to the present
invention for free radical processes.An attempt was made to reproduce the work of Kharasch
and Hannum using pure reagents. Using the Kharasch
procedure, there was no 1-chloro-1-iodoethane synthesized.
However, applicants have discovered a novel process for
synthesizing 1-chloro-1-iodoethane. The 1-chloro-1-iodoethane 
is useful as an iodine containing chain transfer
agent in the polymerization of vinyl chloride, resulting in
a vinyl chloride polymer having good thermal stability
along with low molecular weight and low polydispersity.Logothetis, in an article in Progressive Polymer
Science Vol. 14, 1989, pp 251-296 Pergammon Press p/c
describes the use of iodofluorohydrocarbons in radical
polymerizations of fluorine containing monomers. Lower
polydispersity elastomer fluoropolymers were reported using
perfluoroalkyl iodide transfer agents.
Similarly, Tatemoto et. al. in U.S.-A-4,158,678
have disclosed segmented polymers and their formation using
at least one fluorine containing segment. The segmented
polymers comprise an iodine atom liberated from an
iodinated compound.DE-A-2,045,491 to Klinkenberg and Schrage
describes the polymerization of vinyl chloride in the
presence of exclusively secondary alkyl iodides at
temperatures below zero degrees Celsius in order to reduce
the molecular weight of the polyvinyl chloride
conventionally formed at that temperature range. According
to Klinkenberg et. al., vinyl chloride is polymerized at
low temperature in bulk using a boron oxidizing agent as
the initiator. The reaction is effected in the presence of
acyclic and cyclic secondary alkyl iodides of the formula
R'-
