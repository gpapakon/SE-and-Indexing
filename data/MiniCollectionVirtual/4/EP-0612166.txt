<ABSTRACT>
In order to ensure that a predetermined bit(s) of a 
bit sequence to be transmitted is correctly received by a 

receiver, the predetermined bit is extracted from the bit 
sequence. The extracted bit is encoded and then combined 

with a bit sequence which has not been extracted. The 
combined bit sequence is convolutionally encoded and then 

transmitted to the receiver. The bit sequence 
transmitted undergoes maximum-likelihood decoding using 

viterbi algorithm, wherein the information of the 
predetermined bit encoding is used to decode the 

predetermined bit. Subsequently, the encoded 
predetermined bit portion is extracted and subjected to 

block decoding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method
and apparatus for implementing error-control coding in a
digital data communications system, and more specifically
to such a method and apparatus for correcting and/or
detecting errors induced during data transmission.In order to correct and/or detect channel bit errors
induced during digital data transmission, it is well known
in the art to utilize error-control coding techniques.These techniques are disclosed in a book entitled
"Essential of Error-coding Techniques' edited by Hideki
IMAI and published 1990 by Academic Press, Inc., San
Diego, California 92101, U.S.A., and a book entitled
"Error Control Coding: Fundamentals and Applications' by
Shu tin, et al., published 1983 by Prentice-Hall, Inc.,
Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632, U.S.A., merely by way of
example.Redundant bits are added to each binary code word to
be transmitted in order to provide the code with the
capability of combating the channel noises. A Viterbi
algorithm is able to exhibit error correcting capability
almost equally over the entire bits of a code word.
However, it is sometimes required to transmit a special
bit(s) of each code word with high reliability as compared
with the remaining bits of the code word. In order to
realize such a requirement, according to prior art, it has
been inevitably required that a plurality of pairs of an
encoder and decoder, having different error-control
capability or functions, be provided. However, the above
mentioned known techniques suffer from the drawback that
an overall system is rendered large and complex. Further,
the freedom of the system design is reduced.In an article by G. D'Aria, et al. entitled
"Simulation and Performance of the Pan-European Land
Mobile Radio System" in Vol. 41, No. 2, May 1992 of the
IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, New York,
U.S.A., on pages 177 to 189, there is described the 
performance of the compact-spectrum constant-envelope
modulation chosen by ETSI/GSM, together with concatenated
block and convolutional coding, Viterbi adaptive
equalization and soft-decision Viterbi decoding to cope
with the severe time-and frequency-selective distortions
caused by propagation phenomena, properly modelled for
computer simulation.The specification of UK patent application number
2,238,933, which was published on June 12 1991, describes
a low-overhead method of protecting multi-pulse speech
coders from the effects of severe random or fading bit
pattern errors which combines a standard error correcting
code
