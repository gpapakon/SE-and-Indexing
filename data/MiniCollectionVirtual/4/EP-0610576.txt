<ABSTRACT>
Glass and metal are recovered separately from the solid residues produced in a refuse incineration plant, in particular from slag, by melting. The melting is carried out in two zones. In the first, upper melting zone, the oxidic constituents of the residues are converted into a glass melt. In the second, lower melting zone, the metallic constituents of the residues are converted into a metal melt at elevated temperature. The two melts are isolated separately.

A method for recovering an upper glass melt (19) and a lower 
melt containing metals, from solid residues produced in a refuse 

incineration plant, in particular slags, by melting the solid residues, 
characterized in that the residues containing solid metal 

constituents are subjected to a melting process, wherein the oxidic 
constituents of the solid residues are transferred in a 

first, upper melting zone (7) into a glass melt (19) by means of 
heating electrodes (14, 15), the metal constituents of the solid 

residues are fed to a second, lower melting zone (8) with a 
higher temperature than that of the first, upper melting zone 

(7), generated by carbon electrodes (16, 17), are there transferred 
into a metal melt (20) and both melts are recovered 

separately. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
slag is directly fed from the incineration grate of the refuse 

incineration plant to the first melting zone (7). 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the gases produced during the melting are fed to 

the furnace chamber of the refuse incineration plant. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the gases produced during the melting are fed to 

the incineration grate, preferably the bottom portion of the incineration 
grate. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the boiler fly ash and filter dust from the dust 

clearance installation of the refuse incineration plant are fed 
to the melting process. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that additives are added to the melting process for  

 
affecting the melting process and/or the properties of the melt 

products. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the glass melt (19) is recovered in the uppermost 

zone of the first, upper melting zone (7), and the metal melt 
(20) is drawn off beneath the second, lower melting zone (8). 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the scum produced on the surface of the glass 

melt (24) is separated from the glass melt. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the undissolved sulphates are removed from the 

surface of the glass melt (24) in the first, upper melting zone 
(7). 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the method is carried out on a continuous basis. 
An apparatus for effecting the method according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized by a closed melting furnace 

(3) with a first, upper melting zone (7) with heating electrodes 
(14, 15) for the glass melt (19), a second, lower melting zone 

(8) with carbon heating electrodes (16, 17) for the metal melt 
(20) and a feeding well (4) leading into the upper portion of the 

melting furnace (3), for the solid residues to be melted. 
An apparatus according to claim 11, characterized by an 
overflow (18) arranged in the upper portion of the first, upper 

melting zone (7), for the continuous drawing off of the glass 
melt (19). 
An apparatus according to one of claims 11 to 12, characterized 
in that the second, lower melting zone (8) has a carbon 

lining.  
 
An apparatus according to one of claims 11 to 13, characterized 
in that it has beneath the second, lower melting zone (8) a 

collecting well (9) with a drawing-off device (11) for the discontinuous 
drawing off of the metal melt (20). 
An apparatus according to one of claims 11 to 14, characterized 
in that it has, arranged ahead of the overflow (18), a barrier 

(23) interspaced from the surface (24) of the glass melt 
(19), which defines a glass port (25) lying at the top. 
An apparatus according to one of claims 11 to 15, characterized 
in that the feeding well (4) connects the refuse incineration 

plant to the upper portion of the melting furnace. 
An apparatus according to one of claims 11 to 16, characterized 
in that the feeding well (4) is designed for returning the 

melt gases into the refuse incineration plant.
