<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to certain novel phenolic-hydrazide 
compounds which are useful as metal 
deactivators and antioxidants in polyolefins. This 
invention also pertains to polyolefin compositions 
containing one or more of the phenolic-hydrazide 
compounds. Poly-α-olefins require the presence therein of 
stabilizers to prevent or retard oxidative, thermal 
and/or ultraviolet light deterioration. The most common 
of such poly-α-olefins are low, medium and high density 
polymers derived from ethylene, propylene, mixtures 
thereof and copolymers of ethylene and minor amounts of 
higher α-olefins such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 
1-dodecene, etc. Stabilizers typically present in such 
poly-α-olefins include a phenolic antioxidant such as 
2,2-bis[[3-[3,5-bis(2-methyl-2-propyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-1-oxopropoxy]methyl]-1,3-propanediyl 
3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoate 
[Irganox 
(trademark) 1010 stabilizer] or 2,6-bis(1-methylheptadecyl)-p-cresol, 
phosphites such as trihydrocarbyl 
phosphites including cyclic phosphites and sulfides such 
as thiodipropionate esters such as dilauryl thiodipropionate. When poly-α-olefin compositions are used as 
coatings for metals, e.g., as wire coating compositions, 
the compositions also contain a metal deactivator to 
inhibit polymer degradation which is promoted or 
accelerated by the metal. For example, polyolefin 
compositions used to coat copper wire typically contain 
a copper deactivator such as N,N'-dibenzaloxalyldihydrazide. 
For some wire coating applications, it is 
necessary that the metal deactivator resist leaching  
 
from the polyolefin when it is in contact with such 
materials as petrolatum used as a filler in electrical 
cables. However, most commercial phenolic antioxidants 
such as Irganox 1010 are readily leached from the 
polyolefin coating by petrolatum. DE-B-1267830 discloses a diverse group stabilizer 
compounds which may contain in their structures a 
salicylidene hydrazide residue. The stabilizers are 
said to be useful for stabilizing synthetic polymers 
against decomposition in the presence of copper. 
JP-A-2214751 (Chem. Abs., 1991, 114,83269r) discloses 
fire and oxidation resistant polyolefin composition 
which contain, in addition to a polyolefin, a major 
amount of magnesium hydroxide and minor amounts of 
certain phenolic compounds and heavy metal scavengers. One embodiment of the present invention pertains to 
a class of novel phenolic-hydrazide compounds which 
function as both phenolic antioxidants and metal
