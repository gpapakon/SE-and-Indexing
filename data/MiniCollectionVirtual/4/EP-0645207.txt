<ABSTRACT>
Ultrafine amorphous metal particles which combine the 
properties of ultrafine particles with those of an amorphous 

alloy and a method for the production thereof are disclosed. 
The ultrafine amorphous metal particles are produced by a 

method which comprises discharging a plasma arc against a raw 
metal capable of forming a carbide in a reaction gas using an 

inert gas as a main component thereof and containing a 
hydrocarbon gas, and allowing the metal which has been 

consequently vaporized to contact the reaction gas which has 
been consequently converted into a plasma, thereby inducing 

formation of a solid solution of carbon atoms in the vaporized 
metal and quenching the solid solution in the reaction gas to 

confer an amorphous structure thereon. As the raw metal, at 
least one metal selected from the group consisting of Fe, Mo, 

Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, Al, Si, and Cr is preferably used. By this 
method are obtained ultrafine amorphous metal particles which 

comprise the metal mentioned above, possess at least 50% by 
volume of an amorphous phase, and have particle diameters of 

not more than 500 nm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ultrafine particles of 
amorphous metal and a method for the production thereof. Heretofore, various methods have been introduced for the 
production of ultrafine particles of metals. For example, 
Japanese Patent Application, KOKAI (Early Publication) No. 
2-294,417 discloses a method for producing an ultrafine copper 
powder by decomposing copper hydride and Japanese Patent 
Application, KOKAI No. 2-38,505 discloses a method for 
producing an ultrafine metal powder by subjecting a metal 
powder to repeated oxidation and pulverisation thereby forming 
ultrafine metal oxide particles and reducing the particles in 
an atmosphere of high-temperature plasma containing a reducing 
gas and, at the same time, conferring a spherical shape on the 
particles. These ultrafine particles of metals have been used 
as high-quality magnetic materials for magnetic tapes, as 
sintering additives, and the like, depending on the 
characteristics inherent in their raw materials. The ultrafine 
metal particles which are obtained by the methods cited above, 
however, possess a crystalline structure. Incidentally, amorphous alloys are inherently suitable as 
high permeability materials because they have their component  
 
atoms substantially randomly adjoined to their neighbors and are 
devoid of magnetic anisotropy due to symmetry. Further, the 
amorphous materials are at an advantage in exhibiting high 
mechanical strength, offering high electrical resistance, and 
manifesting excellent resistance to corrosion in addition to 
excelling in magnetic characteristics. Generally such methods as rapid solidification, vacuum 
deposition, and sputtering are adopted for the production of 
amorphous materials. These methods, however, are specifically 
intended for the production of materials which are thin 
ribbons, wires, and films in shape. Ultrafine particles have a large specific surface area, 
strong activity, and very high reactivity. In contrast 
thereto, the amorphous alloys manifest specific properties 
including the high mechanical strength, high electrical 
resistance, excellent resistance to corrosion, and soft 
magnetic properties, as mentioned above. The fundamental object of the present invention is 
therefore to provide ultrafine amorphous metal particles which 
combine the properties of ultrafine particles with those of 
amorphous alloys. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
method capable of infallibly and easily producing the 
ultrafine amorphous metal particles
