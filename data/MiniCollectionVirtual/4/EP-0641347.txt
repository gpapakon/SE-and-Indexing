<ABSTRACT>
A method for the preparation of esters of prolineboronic acid is described. An N-protected pyrrole (I) is lithiated at the 2-position. The lithiated species (II) is reacted with trialkylborate, to yield a protected pyrrole-2-boronic acid (III). This is reduced to form a protected prolineboronic acid (IV), which, in turn, is reacted with a diol to yield an ester (VI). With the boronic acid moiety protected by the ester group, the protecting group on the nitrogen is removed, yielding the desired prolineboronic acid ester (VII). In an alternative synthesis, a protected pyrrolidine (VIII) is lithiated at the 2-position to yield a protected 2-lithio-pyrrolidine (IX). This is reacted with trialkylborate to yield the intermediate IV. The prolineboronic acid esters so produced have a chiral center to the boron atom. Also disclosed are methods for resolving enantiomers. The final products can be coupled to activated carboxylic acids, to yield peptides having a prolineboronic acid ester, instead of an amino acid, at the C-terminus. These boronic acid peptide analogs are useful for inhibiting biologically important proteases. Several methods for removing pinanediol from pinanediol boronate esters are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR MAKING A PROLINEBORONATE ESTERField of the InventionThe invention relates to a method for making optically active prolineboronate esters. These are useful as intermediates in the production of peptides which incorporate prolineboronic acid instead of proline. These peptides, in turn, are useful for inhibiting various biologically important proteases.Background of the InventionInterest in boronic acid analogs of α-amino acids, as well as peptides incorporating a boronic acid analog of an α-amino acid instead of the C-terminal residue, has been generated by reports that these compounds are efficient inhibitors of many serine proteases. See, for example, Matteson et al. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 5241 (1981)]; Kettner et al. [J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15106 (1984)]; and, Kinder et al. [J. Med. Chem. 27, 1919 (1985)].Several workers, including Koehler et al. [Biochemistry, 10, 2477 (1971)] and Rawn et al. [Biochemistry, 13, 3124 (1974)] have hypothesized that the empty p-orbital centered at boron in these compounds interacts with an active-site hydroxyl group of the enzyme, to form a tetrahedral adduct that mimics the transition state of enzymatic hydrolysis. It is thought that the boronic acid analog binds more tightly to the enzyme than does the substrate itself, thereby inhibiting enzymatic action upon the substrate. 

 The boronic acid analogs of α-amino acids and peptides incorporating them are currently of use in research because they are able to shed light on the biological functions of the enzymes they inhibit. Further, as explained below, they are also therapeutically useful.Peptides which incorporate the α-aminoboronic acid analog of proline (BoroPro) at the C-terminus are of special interest because they have been shown to be potent inhibitors of certain post-proline cleaving enzymes. For example, Bachovchin et al. [J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3738 (1990)] have reported that such peptides are inhibitors of IgA proteinases from certain bacteria. These enzymes are strongly implicated in bacterial virulence. Flentke et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 1556 (1991)] have reported that such peptides inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP-IV) , which in turn causes inhibition of antigen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production in T-cells. The latter effects are known to result in suppression of the immune response. Suppression of the immune response is, in turn, useful in the treatment of, for example, organ transplant rejection, graft versus host disease, and various autoimmune diseases.Previous synthetic
