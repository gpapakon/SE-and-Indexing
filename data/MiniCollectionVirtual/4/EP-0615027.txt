<ABSTRACT>
A sanitary cleaning apparatus comprises plurality 
of cleaning water jetting openings (45a,45b) on a nozzle (37), and the 

axes 
of those jetting openings (45a,45b) intersect with each other between 

a jetting surface (46) of the nozzles (37) and a region (A) to be 
cleaned. 

The sanitary cleaning apparatus provides various cleaning 
patterns by giving turbulence to the jetting flow, by mixing 

air in the water, and by changing distribution ratio of 
jetting flows from different jetting openings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sanitary cleaning 
apparatus for cleaning the private parts after stool and more 
particularly to a sanitary cleaning apparatus which effectively 
cleans the private parts by changing the flow state of 
cleaning water and allows a user to select a desired pattern 
of cleaning jet flow. In some conventional sanitary cleaning apparatuses 
for cleaning the private parts, one nozzle or a plurality of 
nozzles are used to jet hot water to the private parts. The 
cleaning water jetted from the nozzle or nozzles are in the 
form of convergent steady flow. Therefore, a user feels 
uncomfortable when the cleaning water collides with the 
private parts. In order to overcome this problem, a sanitary 
cleaning apparatus was proposed and disclosed in examined 
JP-A-58-13688. The apparatus is 
intended to generate a jet flow which gives a soft feeling to 
a user by bubbles contained in the cleaning water. The 
apparatus comprises an ejector nozzle, disposed in the 
vicinity of a jet opening of a nozzle, for increasing the flow 
speed of the cleaning water; and an air sucking portion for 
sucking air from a negative pressure space generated by a  
 
high-speed flow of the cleaning water jetted from the nozzle 
and containing air in the cleaning water. That is, the 
apparatus is intended to give a soft feeling to the user by 
the cleaning water containing air jetted from the jet opening 
during cleaning operation. But the cleaning water does not 
fluctuate in its flow over the region to be cleaned. Hence, 
the cleaning efficiency has yet to be improved. Excrement 
attached to the region to be cleaned is washed away therefrom 
by the process in which the cleaning water penetrates into a 
portion between the region to be cleaned and the excrement, 
thus reducing the connection therebetween and the process in 
which the cleaning water collides with the region to be 
cleaned, thus separating the excrement from the region to be 
cleaned. The excrement can be effectively separated from the 
region to be cleaned by moving jet flows on the region to be 
cleaned fluctuantly and widely. Although the sanitary 
cleaning apparatus used by the above apparatus contains air 
therein, it is convergent jet flow and thus it is impossible 
to clean the region to be cleaned widely in conformity to the 
configuration of the region to be cleaned. The construction 
of the apparatus necessitates the movement of the entire 
nozzle device in order to clean the region to be cleaned 
efficiently and widely.
