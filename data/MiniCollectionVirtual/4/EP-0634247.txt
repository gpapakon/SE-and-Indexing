<ABSTRACT>
A trolley running rail (7) is movably supported by a supporting device (6; 18) in the shape of a portal crane. A trolley (8) is mounted on the trolley running rail (7). The trolley (8) carries a vertically running and displaceable bearer (9). Arranged at its bottom end is a toolhead member (4) rotatable about a horizontal axis (B). The toolhead member (4) carries tools which can be used alternatively, for drilling/milling (11), plasma-arc cutting (14), oxyacetylene flame cutting (13), gas-jet laser cutting. Rolling trestles (1, 2) movable on rails (24) serve to support tubular workpieces (28), which can be clamped and rotated in a clamping device (14) of one rolling trestle (2). Plate-shaped workpieces (33) are carried on a sliding carriage (3). With this machine tool, workpieces (28; 33) can be worked by different tools in a computer-controlled manner so that no manual interventions are necessary.
