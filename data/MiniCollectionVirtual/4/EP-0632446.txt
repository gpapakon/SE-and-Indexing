<ABSTRACT>
A disc cartridge liner is disclosed, the liner including a 
thermoplastic fiber entangling body formed by entangling 

thermoplastic fibers and a cellulose fiber entangling body formed 
by entangling a regenerated cellulose fiber and a refined 

cellulose fiber, the thermoplastic fiber entangling body and the 
cellulose fiber entangling body being heated and pressed to be 

attached to each other. The refined cellulose fiber forming the 
cellulose fiber entangling body is contained therein at a rate 

of not less than 20% by weight, and the refined cellulose fiber 
has dry strength of not less than 3 g/d. The cellulose fiber 

entangling body may contain therein a rubber based binder at a 
rate of not more than 3% by weight. The liner, formed by heating 

and pressing the thermoplastic fiber entangling body and the 
cellulose fiber entangling body to be attached to each other, has 

high strength, dimensional stability, frictional stability and 
wipe-off performance, and exhibits stable and satisfactory 

cleaning effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disc cartridge liner for wiping
off the dust deposited on a recording disc in a disc cartridge according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a disc cartridge lines is disclosed in EP-A-0,495,235.The recording disc, such as an optical disc, a magnetic disk
or a magneto-optical disc, is composed of a disc-like substrate
and a signal recording layer provided on the major surface of the
disc substrate. Conventionally, such a recording disc is housed
in a disc cartridge 31 in the form of casing, as shown in Fig.1,
to be handled as a disc cartridge for preventing damages to the
recording disc due to deposition of dust and contact by fingers
and for facilitating its handling.That is, the disc cartridge is constituted by a recording
disc 32 rotatably housed in the cartridge 31.The recording disc 32 has a central portion 32a thereof as
a portion to be chucked, to which a disc hub 34 presenting
chucking function is secured with an adhesive ring 33 between
them, so that the portion to be chucked is held by a disc
recording/reproducing apparatus for recording/reproducing
information signals onto/from the recording disc 32. The
recording disc 32 also has a signal recording surface 32b for
writing/reading out information signals on the peripheral side
of the central portion 32a.The cartridge 31 housing the recording disc 32 therein is 
composed of a pair of an upper half 35 and a lower half 36. The
upper half 35 and the lower half 36 are abutted to contact each
other for housing the recording disc 32. In the major surfaces
of the upper and lower halves 35, 36, recording/reproduction
openings 37 are formed for exposing at least part of the signal
recording surface 32b of the recording disc 32 to outside. The
lower half 36 is also provided with a chucking opening 38 for
exposing the disc hub 34 mounted on the recording disc 32 to
outside. Thus, the recording disc 32 is held to the disc hub 34
through the chucking opening 38 by the disc recording/reproducing
apparatus, so that information signals are written onto and/or
read out from the signal recording surface 32b through the
recording/reproduction openings 37. The disc cartridge is
provided with a shutter member 39 which closes the
recording/reproducing openings 37 when the disc cartridge is not in use,
to prevent intrusion of dust into the cartridge 31 for protecting
the recording disc. The shutter member 39 is caused to be
slidable along one side edge of the lower half 36.In addition, liners 40 are provided in the disc cartridge,
for
