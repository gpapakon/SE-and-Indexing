<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the combustion of filter residues from paper manufacture, the filter residues, having a calorific value of at least 4,000 kJ/kg, in crumbly consistency are sub-stoichiometrically burned to slag with under-grate blast.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the incineration of captured substances 
from paper production, wherein the captured substances are 

incinerated in a layer with underblast, characterised in that 
captured substances with a calorific value of at least 4000 

kJ/kg and with a crumb-like consistency are incinerated 
substoichiometrically to form clinker. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
captured substances are mechanically compacted before 

incineration. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 

that agglomeration additives are added to the captured 
substances before incineration. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the oxygen, carbon dioxide and carbon 

monoxide content above the burning layer is measured and the 
underblast feed is adjusted depending on the measured 

contents. 
A process according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
measurement of the contents and the adjustment of the 

underblast feed are effected independently of each other in 
successive zones in the direction of movement of the layer.  

 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein 
the incineration of the layer is carried out on a sloping 

oscillating bar grate, characterised in that the captured 
substances are circulated with the aid of inserted oscillating 

bar grate steps. 
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
oscillating bar grate steps have a height of 15 to 20 cm.
