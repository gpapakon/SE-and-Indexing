<ABSTRACT>
For an electrical equipment plug (24) having an insulating material housing and spring chambers (22) which are open to the exterior and to which in each case one contact spring (21) is inserted, the contact springs being connected on the one hand to the electrical conductors and to the protective-earth conductor of a supply lead (23), the insulating material housing consisting of a non-elastic moulding (20) having the spring chambers and of a plug part (25) which is moulded on and insulates the contact points between the contact springs (21) and the conductors of the supply lead, and a retaining plate (10) being provided, which is fitted onto the non-elastic moulding (20) before the plug part (25) is moulded on and is fitted with the contact springs (21) corresponding to the arrangement of the spring chambers (22), it is provided for a protective cap (1) to be fitted onto the second side of the retaining plate (10), which protective cap (1) reaches over the connecting pins (11), including the conductor ends of the supply lead (23).

An electrical appliance plug with a casing of insulating material and spring chambers 
(22; 52) which are open to the outside and into each of which a respective contact spring 

(21; 55) is inserted, wherein the contact springs (21; 55) on the one hand are connected to 
the current conductors and the earthed conductor of a supply line (23; 54) and on the 

other hand are constructed in such a way that they receive plug pins of a counterplug 
device, wherein the casing of insulating material comprises an inelastic shaped part (20; 

51) containing the spring chambers (22; 52) and an injection-moulded plug part (25; 53) 
insulating the contact points between the contact springs and the conductors of the supply 

line, and wherein a retaining plate (10; 40) mounted on the inelastic shaped part (20; 51) 
before the injection-moulding of the plug part (25; 53) is provided and supports the contact 

springs (21; 55) in accordance with the arrangement of the spring chambers, in such 
a way that the said contact springs (21; 55) on the one hand project into the spring 

chambers and on the other hand project on the second side of the retaining plate (10; 40) 
and act as attachment pins for the insulated conductor ends of the supply line, and a protective 

cap (1; 30, 30') overhanging the attachment pins including the conductor ends of 
the supply line is mounted on the second side of the retaining plate (10; 40), 
characterized 
in that
 the retaining plate (10; 40) and the protective cap (1) have mutually complementary 
catching means (5, 14; 32, 45), wherein the catching means are formed by catching 

projections (14; 45) integrally moulded on separating webs (13; 43) mounted on the 
retaining plate (10; 40) between the attachment pins (21; 55) on the one hand and by 

recesses (5; 32) formed in the protective cap and complementary to the catching projections 
on the other hand. 
An electrical appliance plug according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the protective 
cap (1) is a one-piece moulded part attached by clips axially onto the inelastic moulded 

part and the retaining plate (10; 40). 
An electrical appliance plug according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the protective 
cap comprises two mirror-symmetrically identical half shells (30, 30') which are each 

attached, and in particular attached by clips, to the side of the retaining plate (40). 
An electrical appliance plug according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the mirror-symmetrically 
identical half shells (30, 30') are connected together by way of a film 

hinge.  
 
An electrical appliance plug according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
surrounding edge of the protective cap mounted on the retaining plate (10) has associated 

therewith a supporting edge (15) projecting on the retaining plate. 
An electrical appliance plug according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the 
protective cap comprises at least one pin attchment (7; 36) projecting laterally.
