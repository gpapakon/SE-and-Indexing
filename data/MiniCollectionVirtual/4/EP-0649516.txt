<ABSTRACT>
A meter for measuring the quantity of milk by weight flowing in a pipeline comprises a main housing (7) having a main milk inlet pipe (35) and a main milk outlet pipe (36). A buffer chamber (24) in the main housing (7) receives and holds the milk prior to weighing. A weighing container (45) in a weighing chamber (15) sequentially receives discrete quantities of milk from the buffer chamber (24) through a communicating opening (39). The weighing container (45) is mounted on a load cell (46), which sequentially weighs the settled weights of the discrete quantities of milk, the settled weights of which are cumulatively stored. Weighed milk is discharged from the weighing container (45) through a discharge outlet opening (46). A main valve member (40) and a secondary valve member (50) selectively close the communicating opening (39) and the discharge outlet (49), respectively. Milk samples are collected in a milk sample reservoir (135) on discharge of weighed discrete quantities of milk from the weighing container (45) for subsequent collection in a collection jar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a meter for
measuring the quantity by weight of a flowing liquid, and in
particular, for measuring the quantity by weight of a liquid
flowing through a pipeline.In many instances it is desirable to measure a quantity of liquid
flowing through a pipeline. For example, it is desirable to
measure the quantity of milk flowing through a milk pipeline
between a cluster of milking teats and a milk holding vacuum jar
so that a farmer can monitor the milk output of each cow. In
intensive milk production farms, it is essential for a farmer to
know the milk output of each animal. Meters for measuring the
quantity of milk and other liquids flowing in a pipeline are
known. Typically, such meters measure the volume of liquid
flowing in the pipeline. A typical type of such meter is an
impeller type meter which comprises an impeller disposed in the
liquid flow which is rotatable by the flowing liquid. The number
of rotations of the impeller are counted for determining the
quantity of the liquid flowing through the pipeline. Such
impeller type meters are reasonably accurate for determining the
quantity of liquid flow in cases where the liquid is of uniform
density throughout and does not tend to froth or foam. However,
such meters are unsuitable for measuring the quantity of milk
flowing in a pipeline. Milk flowing through a pipeline between
the cluster of milking teats and the vacuum holding jar contains a
considerable amount of entrained air, and furthermore, the
quantity of entrained air is not uniform. Additionally, the
density of milk varies considerably during a milking cycle of a
cow. Initially, at the beginning of a milking cycle, the milk
tends to comprise a relatively high proportion of water, while
towards the end of the milking cycle the milk tends to have a
considerably higher proportion of fat. Furthermore, there is a
considerable tendency for the milk to froth and foam, which 
further leads to inaccuracies in measuring the quantity of milk
flowing in the pipeline. Accordingly, such impeller type meters
are unsuitable for measuring the quantity of milk milked from a
cow. An alternative construction of meter comprises a container
of known volume which is placed in the path of the flowing milk.
On the milk reaching a predetermined level in the container, the
milk is discharged from the container which is again filled.
However, because of the quantity of entrained air, froth, foaming
of the milk and to a lesser extent the variation in density of the
milk, such meters likewise
