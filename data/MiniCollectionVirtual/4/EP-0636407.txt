<ABSTRACT>
A chemical type CO₂ gas generator for a 
carbonated drink dispenser, which while embodied in several 

different implementations, commonly is comprised of a 
first (132,166) and a second (134,165) liquid reagent container with the 

second reagent container including a reaction chamber for 
generating a carbonating gas when the two reagents are 

mixed. Means are coupled between the containers for 
causing the first reagent to transfer from the first 

container to the reaction chamber of the second container 
when the pressure of the generated gas falls below a 

predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to gas generator 
apparatus and more particularly to a CO₂ gas generator 
module which generates the gas by a chemical reaction. A beverage dispenser which uses syrup and 
carbonated water to produce a carbonated beverage 
typically uses a pressurized cylinder containing CO₂ as 
part of the apparatus. Such systems, moreover, require 
complex controls to not only ensure the correct degree of 
carbonation, but also to provide a constant water pressure 
while dispensing. The latter is essential for providing 
proper control of the water-syrup dispensing ratio in a 
constant carbonation level while water is being drawn from 
either an on-board or external supply. Conventional CO₂ 
cylinders comprise heavy, high pressure containers which 
are necessarily returnable, refillable packages and which 
are not only cumbersome and inconvenient in use, but also 
require external control of pressure and safety devices 
for safe operation.  With the trend toward mini-sized and home type 
dispensers of carbonated soft drinks, there is a present 
need for a non-pressurized or low pressure CO₂ package 
inasmuch as it simplifies distribution through normal 
retail channels and provides greater convenience for the 
average user. Home dispensers are essentially relatively 
simple devices, with few controls, and in some instances, 
inserted in refrigerators, eliminating the need for 
separate cooling. This in turn implies a need for a simple, 
disposable, yet durable CO₂ generator module where 
generation of the CO₂ gas occurs automatically with 
little or no user manipulation. Otherwise, the advantages 
of simplicity and cost effectiveness are counterbalanced 
by the lack of essential convenience. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide an improvement in carbonation devices 
for a carbonated drink dispenser. It is another object of the invention to provide 
an improved CO₂ generator for a drink dispenser. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide a chemical type CO₂ generator which delivers 
CO₂ to a carbonator unit at substantially constant 
pressure. It is yet another object of the invention to 
provide a fully automatic gas generator which is simple in 
construction and easy to use. And it is still a further object of the invention 
to provide a disposable, plug-in type gas generator which 
operates at or near user pressure. Briefly, the foregoing and other objects are 
realized by a self-regulating CO₂ generator module which 
in its broadest aspect
