<ABSTRACT>
The device serves to connect a data terminal device (1) to a telecommunications network. The device has at least one user interface (2, 8) disposed facing the data terminal device and one telecommunications interface disposed facing the telecommunications network. The telecommunications interface is designed as a mobile part (6) of a cordless telephone. The mobile part is connected via a mobile part interface (5) to a converter (7) for data transformation. The converter is connected to the user interface for data conversion.
