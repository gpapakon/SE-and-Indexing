<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a rapid method 
for synthesizing C-disaccharides. More particularly, 

the process involves the formation of a tethered ketal 
intermediate which is then cyclized and detethered 

resulting in a protected C-disaccharide as a single 
diastereomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
synthesizing disaccharides in which the interglycosidic 
oxygen atom linkage is replaced by a methylene group. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to an 
expeditious process to synthesize C-disaccharides and 
other types of carbon-linked disaccharides by use of a 
temporary ketal tether to facilitate carbon-carbon bond 
formation. C-disaccharides constitute a class of non-natural 
analogs of disaccharides in which the interglycosidic 
oxygen atom is replaced by a methylene group. These 
C-disaccharides are conformationally close to their 
natural counterparts but are not degraded by chemical 
and/or biological hydrolysis. As potential inhibitors 
of glycosyl hydrolases such as the disaccharides of the 
digestive tract as described by Martin et al J. Org. 
Chem., 55, 5188 (1990) and as probes of the 
stereoelectronic effects which may control the 
conformation of oligosaccharides as described by Lai, 
W. PH.D. Dissertation, SUNY-Binghamton (1992) these 
pseudodisaccharides are of considerable interest. Furthermore, the great interest in natural and 
unnatural glycosidase inhibitors has even increased 
because HIV activity might be affected by such 
compounds. See, Gruters et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res.Commun., 148, 206 (1983). Furthermore, the 
inaccessibility to hydrolytic cleavage of the C-disaccharides 
is a particular stimulus to their 
synthesis. Rapid progress has also been observed in the past 
for the selective synthesis of complex oligosaccharides 
which has stimulated the understanding of the cellular 
biological role that is contributed to these compounds. The first synthesis of a C-disaccharide was 
reported in 1983 by Sinay et al. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. 
Commun., 1353 (1983). A β(1-->6)-methylene bridged 
gentiobiose derivative was synthesized by using a C₆-electrophile, 
C₇-nucleophile course and required 
diastereocontrol only at the C₆-species. In this method 
2, 3, 4, 6-tetrabenzylglucopyranolactone was condensed 
with the anion of methyl 6, 7-dideoxy-2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-α-1-gluco-hept-6-ynopyranoside 
followed by 
triethylsilane reduction. After hydrogenolysis, a 
synthetic β(1-->6)-C-disaccharide was obtained. After the first synthesis of a C-disaccharide was 
described in the art, many different scientific groups 
proceeded to work on different methods for the 
synthesis of a variety of different C-disaccharides in 
different stereo specific configurations. For example,
