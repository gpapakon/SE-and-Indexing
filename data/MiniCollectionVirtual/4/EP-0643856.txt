Receiver (1) for a data carrier card, comprising an 
introduction slot (4) provided between two lips (5, 5A), one of 

these lips being a support lip (5), means (6, 17P) for bending 
the card (3), which are disposed, in the introduction direction 

of the card (3), beyond this support lip (5), means (11) for 
guiding the front edge (3A) of said card (3) in order to bring 

the card (3) into the reading position, and means (8) for 
receiving, in the reading position, the front edge (3A) of the

be moved in the introduction direction of the card (3) under the 

action of pushing the card (3) and against the action of first 
return means (13), the bending means (6, 17P) being arranged to 

exert on the card (3) a force substantially perpendicular to the 
sides of the card (3), pushing it against said support lip (5), 

characterised by the fact that in the reading position the card 
retains the possibility of receiving an additional push, this 

additional push enabling a card broken level with the 
introduction slot to leave the support lip, and that, as soon as 

the card has escaped from the support lip, the bending means 
acting against the action of the guide means (11) eject the card 

(3) from the introduction path. 
Receiver for a card according to Claim 1, in which the 
abutment wall (9) comprises a resilient articulation having the 

function of said first return means (13).

into said card receiver (1).

leaf spring (17R) associated with the bending means constitutes 

said abutment wall (9). 
Receiver for a card according to one of Claims 5 and 6, 
in which said leaf spring (17R) associated with the bending means 

acts as guide means (11). 
Receiver for a card according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in 
which second return means (14) tend to push the card (3) back out 

of said receiving member (8). 
Receiver for a card according to one of Claims 1 to 8, in 
which the inner wall (2F) of said card receiver (1) situated 

close to the support lip (5) is at least partially turned towards 
the direction for ejection of broken cards (3). 
Receiver for a card according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
in which an abutment member (15), on which this receiving member 

(8) bears, when it returns towards the position for reading the 
card (3), after having been pushed back, is provided for ensuring 

the exact positioning of the receiving member (8). 
Card reader (1L), comprising a card receiver (1) 
and an interface (16) for reading said card (3), characterised 

by the fact that the card receiver (1) is in accordance 
with one of Claims 1 to 10 and by the fact that the interface 

(16) for reading the card is integral with the receiving member 
(8).
