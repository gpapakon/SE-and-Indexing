<ABSTRACT>
A joint-type fishing rod which uses, as a set, a 
plurality of rod tubes (S₁-S₆) each formed by winding prepreg 

made 
of high strength fibers impregnated with synthetic resin. 

In the leading end portion of the joining cylindrical 
portion (I3-I6) of the insertion side rod tube to be joined 

together with their adjoining receive side rod tube, there 
is formed a joining guide portion (G3-G6) with the diameter 

gradually reduced to a position nearer to a central axis of 
the insertion side rod tube than the inner surface of the 

main body portion of the insertion side rod tubes. The 
fishing rod allows the joining operation to be carried out 

quickly, is light in weight, is of high strength, and has 
a good figure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a joint type
fishing rod formed of fiber reinforced prepreg and a method
of manufacturing the same, and the present invention can
also be applied to a joint type fishing rod for competition
such as a bottom rod or the like necessary to reduce the
required time for joining together a plurality of rod
tubes.As a conventional joint type fishing rod in which
a plurality of rod tubes are joined together in use, there
is disclosed, in GB-A-1130106, a fishing rod
in which a male ferrule consisting of a component having a
rounded leading end and a female ferrule for reception are
mounted on the front and rear portions of the respective
rod tubes, to thereby enable quick insertion of an
insertion side joining cylindrical portion into a receive
side joining cylindrical portion.However, due to this construction wherein
separate components, i.e. male and female ferrules are
mounted to the rod tubes which are to be joined together,
the joining cylindrical portion of a rod tube on the
insertion side must be unavoidably made further narrower,
which results in lowering the strength of that portion. In
particular, a fishing rod including such rod tubes is easy
to break in the mounting boundary where the above-mentioned
components are mounted, and also the increased weight of
the joined portions causes the increase of the entire
weight of the fishing rod. Further, such construction
deteriorates the design of the fishing rod in that the
joined portions are bulky. In view of the above-mentioned conventional
circumstances, it is an object of the invention to provide
a joint type fishing rod which allows a quick operation for
joining together a plurality of rod tubes, is light in
weight, is of high strength and has a good figure, and a
method of manufacturing the same.FR-A-1418258 discloses a joint type fishing rod made
of several light metal tube rods in which a smaller overall
diameter rod is inserted into the next larger overall
diameter rod.US-A-1871985 discloses a joint type fishing rod
comprising, as a set, a plurality of rod tubes wherein at
least one of the rod tubes is provided at its one end with
an integral joining guide portion the diameter of which is
gradually decreased relative to the rest of the at least
one rod tube to facilitate and guide insertion into another
rod tube; the joining guide portion being simultaneously
moulded with the at least one rod tube.According to the present invention, such a fishing rod
is characterised in that each rod tube is formed by winding

<CLAIMS>
A joint type fishing rod comprising, as a set, a
plurality of rod tubes (S3,S4,S5,S6) wherein at least one

of the rod tubes (S3,S4,S5,S6) is provided at its one end
with an integral joining guide portion (G3,G4,G5,G6) the

diameter of which is gradually decreased relative to the
rest of the at least one rod tube (S3,S4,S5,S6) to

facilitate and guide insertion into another rod tube; the
joining guide portion (G3,G4,G5,G6) being simultaneously

moulded with the at least one rod tube (S3,S4,S5,S6);
characterised in that each rod tube (S3,S4,S5,S6) is formed

by winding at least one prepreg formed of high-strength
fibres impregnated with synthetic resins; each joining

guide portion (G3,G4,G5,G6) is formed of at least one
integral plastic layer (10); the integral joining guide

portion of at least one larger overall diameter rod tube
(S3,S4,S5,S6) is insertable into a receiving end

(R2,R3,R4,R5) of a smaller overall diameter rod tube
(S2,S3,S4,S5); and is retained entirely by an interference

fit between the two rod tubes.
A joint type fishing rod according to claim 1, wherein
the plastic layer (10) is laid entirely over the at least

one rod tube from one axial end to the other.
A joint type fishing rod according to claim 1 or claim
2, wherein a reinforcing layer (12,14,22) is integrally

formed on a portion of at least one of radially internal
and external surfaces of the plastic layer (10) forming the

joining guide portion.
A joint type fishing rod according to claim 3, wherein
the reinforcing layer (12,14,22) is chamfered after being

moulded. 
A joint type fishing rod according to claim 3 or claim
4, wherein the reinforcing layer (12,14,22) contains more

reinforcing fibres arranged in a circumferential direction
with respect to the length of the at least one rod tube

than in a longitudinal direction.
A joint type fishing rod according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein each of the rest of the rod tubes

is also formed in the same way as the at least one rod
tube.
A joint type fishing rod according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein, the plastic layer is chamfered

after being moulded.
A method of manufacturing a rod tube (S3,S4,S5,S6) for
use in a joint type fishing rod according to any one of the

preceding claims, the method comprising the steps of
providing a metal core (30) having a diameter-reduced

portion (34,36) corresponding in location to the joint
guide portion (G3,G4,G5,G6), and a main portion (32) for

forming the rest of the rod tube (30); and winding a
prepreg (10P,12P,14P,T1,10) around the metal core (30).
A method according to claim 8, wherein slits (S) are
formed in the prepreg (10P,12P,14P) which are arranged to

extend substantially axially along the metal core (30) and
the prepreg (10P,12P,14P) is wound in such a manner that

the slits (S) are substantially laid on the diameter-reduced
portion (34).
A method according to claim 8, wherein the prepreg is
in the form of a narrow-width tape (T1) which is spirally

wound around the diameter-reduced portion (34) in such a 
manner that at least a part of the prepreg (T1) is located

around the main portion (32).
A method according to claim 8, wherein a chamfering
supplemental layer (42') is provided on one of radially

internal and external surfaces of the prepreg (10) so as to
substantially fill up a level difference between the main

(32) and diameter-reduced (36) portions; combining the
chamfering supplemental layer (42') with the prepreg (10)

thus wound, to provide an integral part; and chamfering an
end of the integral part to provide the joint guide portion
