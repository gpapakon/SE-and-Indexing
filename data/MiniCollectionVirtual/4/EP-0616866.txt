<ABSTRACT>
A vessel body (2) has an opening (6) of a specified diameter 
formed in the bottom and a device for cooling an inner 

surface region (2a). A lid (14) made of the same material as a 
metal to be molten is attachably fixed to the opening (6) of the 

vessel body (2). The lid (14) projects upward from the opening 
(6) and has a cylindrical recess (18) at a lower central part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vessel for melting a 
high purity metal (hereinafter referred to merely as "melting 
vessel") which is used for producing powders of a high purity 
metal and in which a high purity metal is molten without contamination, 
and also to a method for manufacturing the same. As a method for producing powders of a high purity metal, 
there have been widely used a variety of methods including a 
gas-atomizing method and modified methods thereof. A variety of 
melting vessels are at present used as the one for use with 
these methods, but are unsatisfactory in that they contaminate 
the high purity metal and cannot be used stably. In order to overcome these problems, the inventors have 
developed a melting vessel including a vessel body having an 
opening of a specified diameter formed in the bottom and means 
for cooling an inner surface region, and a lid made of the same 
material as a metal to be molten for closing the opening of the 
vessel body, and have filed this invention (Japanese Patent 
Application No. 4-132857; EP-A-0 587 993). When the above melting vessel is used to produce powders of 
a high purity metal, it is necessary to, after the metal is 
molten in the vessel, direct a beam such as a laser beam at the 
center of the lid from a beam generator arranged right above the 
lid, so that a portion of the lid melts to form a bore and the 
molten metal falls downward therethrough. However, it is difficult 
to form, in this vessel, the bore accurately at the center 
of the lid (beam directed position) for the following reasons.  
 
In order to upgrade the quality of metal powders, there has been 
a demand for a melting vessel in which a bore can be formed 
accurately in the lid. One of the reasons which cause the bore to be formed at a 
position displaced from the beam directed position is the influence 
of the nonuniform cooling of the lid. While the beam is 
directed, the lid is cooled constantly through a portion thereof 
connected with the vessel body. It is, however, impossible to 
connect the lid with the vessel body perfectly uniformly over 
the periphery of the lid, which causes a cooling rate to vary 
over this periphery of the lid. Thus, the bore tends to be 
formed at a position displaced from the beam directed position 
toward the portion of the lid where the cooling rate is lower. One of the other reasons is the requirement of a large 
amount of energy to melt the lid. Particularly, in the case of 
the metal to be molten which requires high energy to be

<CLAIMS>
A vessel for melting a high purity metal, comprising: 

a vessel body (2) having an opening (6) of a specified 
diameter formed in the bottom and means (8, 10, 12) for cooling 

an inner surface region (2a); and a lid (14) made of the same 
material as a metal to be molten for fittably closing the opening 

(6) of the vessel body (2), the lid (14) having a thin (t2) 
portion (14a) which is located on or near a center line crossing 

the center of the opening (6) and at a predetermined minimum 
distance from the periphery of the lid (14). 
A vessel according to claim 1 in which the thin (t2) 
portion (14a) leaves a recess extending over the remaining 

height (t1-t2) of the lid (14), the diameter of which is smaller 
than that of the opening (6), the recess or the thin (t2) port
ion 
(14a) being located within the opening (6) with their outer 

periphery having a predetermined distance from the periphery of 
the opening (6). 
A vessel according to claim 1 or 2 in which the center 
of the thin (t2) portion (14a) is located on or near the center 

line. 
A vessel according to one or more of claims 1-3 in 
which, in the closing position of the lid (14), the thin (t2)  

 
portion (14a) is provided in the upper thereof. 
A vessel according to one or more of claims 1-4 in 
which, along the center line, the thickness (t2) of the thin 

portion (14a) is less than a half, preferably less than one 
third of the thickness (t1) of the lid (14). 
A vessel according to claim 5 in which the thin portion 
(14a) has a thickness (t2) of 3 to 10 mm, preferably 4 to 6 mm, 

and most preferably 5 mm on the basis of vessel body dimensions 
of about 250 mm diameter and 100 mm height and the use of about 

5 to 10 kg molten metal. 
A vessel according to claim 5 or 6 in which the thickness 
(t2) of the thin portion (14a) is determined so that it may 

be molten by a plasma beam of 1300 to 1500 A. 
A method for manufacturing a lid (14) fitting into an 
opening (6) of a vessel according to one or more of claims 1-6, 

comprising the steps of: 

closing the opening (6) from below by a closure member (20) 
having a substantially flat upper surface (20a) and a cylindrical 

projection (22) projecting upward from the upper surface, 
such that the projection (22) is located at the center of the 

opening (6);
