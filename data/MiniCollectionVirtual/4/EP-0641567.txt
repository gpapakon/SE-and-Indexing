<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stable aqueous compositions containing α-Interferon
hybrid.The Interferons are families of inducible secretory proteins produced in response to viral
and other stimuli. The α-Interferons are currently being used clinically for the treatment
of a number of different disease states which include: Hairy-cell leukaemia, Kaposi's
sarcoma in AIDS, chronic Non-A, Non-B hepatitis and Basal cell carcinoma.Recombinant human α-Interferon B/D hybrid moieties have been constructed carrying
various portions of the sequence of the parent α-Interferon B and D species in order to
create molecules with advantageous properties (A. Meister, G. Uz, K. E. Mogensen, J.
Gen. Virol. 67, 1633, (1986)). The parent molecules are cleaved in order to exchange the
DNA segments coding for peptide sequences 1-60, 61-92, 93-150 and 151-166.
The BDBB
hybrid has been found to exhibit particularly interesting preclinical anti-viral
and
anti-proliferative activity (H.K. Hochkeppel, M. Gruetter, M.A. Horisberger, J.K. Lazdins,
Drugs of the Future, 17 (10), 899, (1992)). Proteins, such as α-Interferon
BDBB, possess
complex chemical and physical properties which cause difficulties in the purification,
separation, storage and delivery of these species. Hence, the formulation of protein
medicinal agents differs greatly from that of rigid small organic molecules. Several
classes of excipients have been employed in parenteral formulations of proteins and
peptides. Since proteins have poor oral bioavailability, the most common approach is to
present them as injectable products in order to achieve efficient drug delivery. Because of
the instability in solution, proteins are, generally, formulated as lyophilised (freeze-dried)
powders for reconstitution immediately prior to injection by subcutaneous, intramuscular
or intravenous routes.Protein degradation can be separated into two categories, namely chemical stability and
physical stability. Chemical stability refers to all processes whereby the protein is
chemically modified via bond cleavage or formation. Physical stability does not involve
covalent modification, but rather changes in the higher order structure of the protein, e.g. 
via denaturation, aggregation or precipitation. It is desirable to maintain hybrid
α-Interferon BDBB in a disaggregated state in order to eliminate any possible adverse
immunogenic effects and/or inconsistent dosing during therapy.At a desirable concentration for use as an injectable therapeutic agent, hybrid α-Interferon
BDBB is
