<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic low pressure reservoir (48) for joint fluid (30) and removal of particulate debris from arthritic joints or joints containing artificial, man-made prostheses filters the fluid (30) and traps any particles therein, thus removing them from the periprosthetic space. The extraarticular location of the reservoir (48) is at a lower pressure than the intraarticular space (31). Increases in intraarticular joint fluid (30) pressure during normal joint activities will cause fluid (30) and particulate debris to preferentially flow into the low pressure reservoir (48). In this manner, intraarticular fluid pressures are reduced, joint fluid is filtered, and the particulate and/or solute species are collected in the device while joint fluid (30) either diffuses into the extraarticular space or is recycled back into the joint. The device may be implanted at the same time as or any time after a joint is replaced by a prosthesis. This device may also be incorporated as a fixed feature of an implant/bearing combination.

<DESCRIPTION>
Apparatus for joint fluid decompression and filtrationBackground of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the field of orthopaedic surgery and has particular applications in the treatment of arthritic joints and to joints replaced with man-made prosthetic joints.Normal joints in humans and animals are composed of the ends of two bones which are covered by a smooth gliding surface of articular cartilage. The ends of the bones are linked by a fibrous structure called the capsule which helps stabilize the, joint and isolates the joint from the surrounding tissues. The inner surface of the capsule is lined with a thin layer of specialized tissue called the synovium, which in response to motion produces a fluid to lubricate the joint. The space occupied by the fluid is referred to as the joint space. Alternating high and low pressures are produced in the articular cartilage and in the joint fluid during normal use, and are important for joint lubrication.Normal joints allow repetitive smooth gliding motion over many years. Abnormal or excessive wear, however, results in a pathologic condition generically referred to as arthritis (inflammation of a joint) . The cardinal signs of inflammation are pain, warmth, redness, and swelling. In general, this pathologic response is associated with a failure of the natural (articular cartilage) bearing surface of the joint, including wear 

 and fragmentation of the cartilage, and the liberation of the wear products into the joint space. These wear products themselves cause inflammation which further contributes to degradation of the cartilage. . Replacement of the diseased and worn joints with man-made (prosthetic) artificial bearing surfaces has revolutionized the treatment of arthritis over the past thirty years. Most commonly, a metal bearing surface is mated to a plastic bearing surface, although other materials and combinations thereof are possible. The specific geometry of the surfaces is dictated by the anatomy and mechanical functions of the particular joint (hip, knee, shoulder, elbow, ankle, etc.). The prosthetic articulation restores a smooth gliding motion to the joint for a number of years. Following the operation to replace an arthritic joint with an artificial joint, tissue reforms around the articulating surfaces. This tissue is referred to as the pseudocapsule, to distinguish it from the natural capsule. Like the normal capsule, the pseudocapsule synovium produces fluid which lubricates the prosthetic articulation.The coefficient of
