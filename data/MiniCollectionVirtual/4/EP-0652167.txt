<ABSTRACT>
An installation consisting of a shelf system (1), of a handling system, of a first conveying system for the supply of conveying material and of a second conveying system for collecting and issuing commissioned orders can reach its capacity limit in particular operating states. The failure of the handling system leads to the shutdown of the entire installation. What is described is a commissioning installation, in which paper stacks can be intermediately stored in shelf compartments (7) in a shelf system (1). The shelf compartments (7) are accessible on both sides, so that material can be put into and taken out of storage from the front side and from the rear side of the shelf system (1), in which case by at least one travelling robot (8, 9). A conveyor band (4) for the supply of paper stacks is guided through the shelf and can position paper stacks at specific reference positions for transfer to the two travelling robots (8, 9). The commissioning of orders which are to be issued and which are collated according to customer requirements takes place optionally by means of the travelling robots (8, 9).
