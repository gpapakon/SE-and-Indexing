<ABSTRACT>
A surface coating agent to be coated on the surface of 
an elastic molding die, which is a solvent solution of a 

polyurethane obtained by reacting a polyol with an aromatic 
polyisocyanate. The surface coating agent can be coated on 

the inside surface of the elastic molding die to form a 
coating layer, thereby obtaining a molding with surface 

gloss. Further, the surface coating agent can be 
incorporated with silicone and/or a fluorine compound to 

improve oil resistance of the elastic molding die, 
preventing the elastic molding die from being swollen by oil 

components of a molding material and improving durability. 
When a polyether type polyol is used as the polyol, water 

resistance of the elastic molding die can be even further 
improved. The surface coating agent using 

polycarbonatepolyol as the polyol has improved adhesion to 
the elastic molding die, thereby improving the durability. 

Further, the surface coating layer can be even more securely 
bonded to the surface of the elastic molding die by coating 

the surface coating agent after primer coating, or after 
acid treatment, or after acid treatment and primer coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for coating the elastic
molding die with a surface coating agent for coating an
inside surface of an elastic molding die to improve
releasing and surface gloss of a molding produced using the
elastic molding die.Heretofore, there has been known a method for molding
chocolate, cheese, jelly, ice, boiled fish paste, lipsticks,
and the like using a hollow elastic molding die having an
opening which is made of an elastic material such as
chloroprene rubber. This molding method is carried out as
follows. A fluid molding material is poured into the
molding die from its opening to fill the die, heated or
cooled to solidify the molding material, and then the 
solidified molding is removed from the elastic molding die.
To take out the molding from the elastic molding die, for
example, the elastic molding die is expanded by means of
utilizing an air pressure difference to peel the solidified
molding from the elastic molding die, and the molding is
discharged from the expanded opening. The elastic molding
die can be repeatedly used.However, the elastic molding die is made of an elastic
material incorporated with a reinforcing material such as
carbon black or clay to improve the mechanical properties
and durability. When molded using the elastic molding die,
surface gloss of the molding tends to be due to the
incorporated reinforcing material which may impairs the
product quality, especially for molded chocolate and
lipsticks which are required to have good surface gloss.
Furthermore, there has been a problem in that when the
molding material contains water or is based on an oily
substance, the inside surface of the elastic molding die is
gradually swelled resulting in deformation during repeated
use of the elastic molding die. Further, due to such
swelling, the inside surface of the elastic molding die is
roughened, losing the surface gloss of the molded product.
To solve these problems, the inventors previously proposed
that the inner layer of the elastic molding die is formed of
an elastomer not containing a reinforcing material or an 
oil-resistant elastomer (Japanese Laid-open Patent
Publication 5-57730).An elastic molding die composed of an elastomer laminate
film, of which the innermost layer is formed of an elastomer not
containing fillers, has been disclosed in European Patent Application
0 519 372.Therefore, a primary object of the present invention is
to improve the previous proposal for the layer forming the
inside surface of the elastic molding die. Another
