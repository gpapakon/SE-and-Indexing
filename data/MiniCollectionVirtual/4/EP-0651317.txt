<ABSTRACT>
An output apparatus and method is capable of
transferring information showing a print data amount,

determining a memory amount and estimating whether an
inferior image will be output or not in accordance with

the print data amount and memory amount. Accordingly,
the apparatus and method can determine in advance

whether to transfer the data, whether to print the data
and whether to provide a display to an operator

indicating that an output image will be of inferior
quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an output apparatus such as a
printer and a method for transferring data that
estimates whether image data will produce an inferior
quality image or not prior to output.When image data is transferred from a host computer to
a printer, the image data may be complicated and the
printer may have insufficient memory to store all the
image data. As a result, an image printed in response
to the stored image data will be of inferior quality.
Nevertheless, recently some printing devices have been
developed which will automatically output the image
data even if it results in an inferior image.If the operator at the printer is unaware of the
problem, the resultant image may be inexplicable. The
operator may try to output the image data again,  
resulting in wasted time, or may erroneously conclude
that the printer is malfunctioning.US-A-5216754 describes a printing system preventing failures and interruptions
associated with the inability of an image generation subsystem to generate a page in
real time by determining the complexity of a page content prior to its submission to the
subystem. The page may be automatically simplified. No information associated with
the content of the page is transmitted in advance of the print data of the page.The present invention has been made in consideration of
the above situation, and has as one of its objects to
provide an output apparatus and method capable of
estimating image quality before printing.Another object of the present invention is to provide
an output apparatus and method capable of estimating
image quality before print data is transferred to a
printer.Still another object of the present invention is to
provide an output apparatus and method capable of
estimating image quality and controlling further data
processing in accordance with the estimation.Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a printing apparatus in
accordance with a first embodiment of the present
invention.Fig. 2 is a flowchart showing processing steps of a
method operative in the first embodiment.Fig. 3 is a flowchart showing processing steps of a
method operative in a second embodiment.Fig. 4 is a flowchart showing processing steps of a
method operative in a third embodiment.Fig. 5 is a perspective view of a laser beam printer. Fig. 6 is a perspective view of the main body of an
ink-jet printer.Fig. 7 is a block diagram of a control unit of the ink-jet
printer of Fig. 6.Embodiments of the present invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a

<CLAIMS>
An output apparatus connected to a host computer,
the host computer providing print data to be

transferred to said output apparatus and first
information indicative of an amount of the print data

to be transferred, where the print data to be
transferred includes data corresponding to an image,

said output apparatus comprising:

receiving means for receiving from the host
computer the first information indicative of the amount

of print data to be transferred;
determining means for determining second
information indicative of an amount of memory space

available to said output apparatus for storing the
print data to be transferred;
estimating means for estimating, in response to
the first and second information, an estimated quality

of an output image that said output apparatus can
output in accordance with the print data to be

transferred; and
control means for controlling output of the image
in accordance with the estimated quality.
An output apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein
said control means determines whether or not the

estimated quality is at least as good as a threshold
quality and controls output of the object image in

response to the determination.
An output apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein
said control means inhibits output of the object image

when the estimated image quality is less than the
threshold quality.
An output apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein
said control means outputs a notification of inferior 

image quality to an operator when the estimated image
quality is less than the threshold quality.
An output apparatus according to Claim 4, further
comprising manually actuable key means for entering a

command to output the object image, wherein after said
control means outputs the notification, said control

means outputs the object image only in response to
actuation of said key means.
An output method for controlling an output
apparatus connected to a host computer, the host

computer providing print data to be transferred to the

output apparatus and first information indicative of an
amount of the print data to be transferred, where the

print data to be transferred includes data
corresponding to an image, said output method

comprising the steps of:

receiving from the host computer the first
information indicative of the amount of print data to

be transferred;
determining second information indicative of an
amount of memory space available to the output

apparatus for storing the print data to be transferred;
estimating, in response to the first and second
information, an estimated quality of an output image

that the output apparatus can output in accordance with
the print data to be transferred; and
controlling output of the image in accordance with
the estimated quality.
An output method according to Claim 6, wherein
said control step determines whether or not the

estimated quality is at least as good as a threshold
quality and controls output of the object image in

response to the determination. 
An output method according to Claim 7, wherein
said control step inhibits output of the object image

when the estimated image quality is less than the
threshold quality.
An output method according to Claim 7, wherein
said control step outputs a notification of inferior

image quality to an operator when the estimated image
quality is less than the threshold quality.
An output method according to Claim 9, further
comprising a step of manually actuating key means for

entering a command to output the object image, wherein
after said control step outputs the notification, said

control step outputs the object image only in response
to said actuation step.
