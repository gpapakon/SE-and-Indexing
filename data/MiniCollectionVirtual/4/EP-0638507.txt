<ABSTRACT>
An expandable shaft comprises a cylindrical core (12); at 
least three elongated rails (14, 16, 18) located on the 

outer surface of said core and equally spaced around the 
circumference thereof to provide slots (20, 22, 24) extending 

parallel with the core axis; elongated pressure protrusion 
means (28) located in each slot and adapted to be 

moved radially outward of the shaft; elongated inflatable 
means located in each slot radially inward of the elongated 

pressure protrusion means (34) and adapted to move said 
elongated pressure means radially outward when inflated; 

conduit means (42) within said core connected to inflate 
said elongated inflatable means, wherein said core and said 

rails are formed of a composite fiberous material in which 
the fibers extend substantially parallel with the axis of 

said core.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to drive mandrels or shafts
for gripping the internal surfaces of sleeves or tubes on
which web material may be wound.In the winding and rewinding of web material such as paper,
cloth and other sheet material, the web is wound on a
sleeve or tube having an inside diameter slightly larger
than the shaft on the winding mechanism. In this manner the
sleeve may readily be slipped on and off the shaft. As a
result an arrangement must be provided to effect a secure
driving connection between the shaft and sleeve upon which
the web material is wound. Accordingly there exists shafts
that are expandable to grip against the web sleeve to
provide a secure driving engagement.The present invention is directed to such expandable shafts
and the method of making them that provides functional and
structural advantages over present expandable shafts.Expandable shafts or mandrels are generally constructed
with elements on the surface adapted to be extended radially
outward by inflation of bladders within the shaft. Shaft
designs fall into two general categories, the lug type and
slotted rail type. The former contemplates a number of
discreet lugs located at different points along the shaft.Customarily there is one or more bladders located within
the shaft that are appropriately inflated to cause the lugs
to extend radially outward to grip the web sleeve that
surrounds the shaft. The slotted type of expandable shaft
customarily includes a plurality of equally spaced slots
around the circumference of the shaft and elongated pressure
elements located within the slots. Individual bladders
located within the shaft slots are inflated to bear against
the pressure elements and extend them radially outward for
the gripping of surrounding web sleeve.Examples of these prior art shafts are shown in U.S. Pat.
Nos. 3,493,189; 3,552,672; 3,904,144 and 4,473,195. These expandable shafts of the prior art are customarily
made of aluminium extrusions or machined steel cylinder
bodies are used to support the larger weight and the higher
stiffness applications. The weight of these steel expandable
shafts is often excessive and frequently outside the
current OSHA
(the Occupational Safety and Health Agency of U.S. government)
weight limits for lifting by individuals
without mechanical assistance. The aluminium shafts on the
other hand, are limited to lighter weights and less stiffness
dependent applications. These are some of the disadvantages
of prior art expandable shafts that the present
design serves to

a cylindrical core (12) of fiber and resin composite material;
at least three elongated rails (14, 16, 18) located on
the outer surface of said core and equally spaced around

the circumference thereof to provide slots (20, 22, 24)
extending parallel with the core axis;
elongated pressure protrusion means (28) located in each
slot and adapted to be moved radially outward of the shaft;
elongated inflatable means (34) located in each slot radially
inward of the elongated pressure protrusion means (28) and

adapted to move said elongated pressure means (28) radially
outward when inflated;
conduit means (42) within said core connected to inflate
said elongated inflatable means (34),

characterized in that said rails (14, 16, 18) are formed of a composite
fiberous material in which the fibers extend substantially

parallel with the axis of said core 
and in that said rails
are bonded to the outer surface of said core (12).
The expandable shaft according to Claim 1 in which
said composite fiberous material is of carbon fibers.
The expandable shaft according to Claim 1 in which
said composite fiberous material is of glass fibers.
The expandable shaft according to Claim 1, characterized
in that said core (12) and said rails (14, 16, 18)

are formed of a composite material of carbon fibers in an
organic matrix, the carbon fibers of said rails extending

longitudinally of the axis of said shaft, the carbon fibers
of said core extending angularly of the axis of the shaft

thereby providing resistance to torsional forces.
