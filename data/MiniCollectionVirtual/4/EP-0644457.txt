<ABSTRACT>
A lighttight package of a rolled light-sensitive material, 
which comprises a core (12), a light-sensitive film (10) wound on 

the core, a light-shielding circumferential wrapper (17) to shield 
the circumferential surface of the wound film from ambient light and 

a pair of light-shielding flanges (13, 14) to shield the side 
surfaces of the wound web, wherein the light-shielding flanges have 

a circumferential groove (20, 21) into which folded margins (18, 19) 
of the circumferential cover are seated and withheld.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lighttight package of a 
rolled light-sensitive material. In the packaging of light-sensitive material for use in e.g. 
phototypesetters or X-ray imagers, disposable film roll cassettes as 
well as daylight loading film roll packages are used. Daylight 
loading film packages are cheaper than disposable film cassettes, 
and are also preferred for ecological reasons. Several types of daylight loading film roll packages are known 
that comprise a circumferential wrapper and two end covers light-tightly 
sealed to the circumferential cover. In one embodiment, the 
circumferential wrapper has lips that are folded over the end covers 
and are sealed thereto (see US-A-4,505,387 of Fuji Photo Film Co., 
Ltd.) In another embodiment the end covers have lips that are 
folded over the circumferential cover and are sealed thereto (see 
US-A-4,148,395 of E.Kodak Cy.) In still another embodiment marginal 
portions of the circumferential and the end covers are sealed to 
each other at their inside faces (see US-A-4,733,777 of Agfa-Gevaert 
N.V.) These, and similar packages have the advantage that their 
length is neglectably larger than the width of an unwrapped film 
roll so that their use in so-called machine-dedicated cassettes that 
are originally designed for being loaded in a darkroom with a roll 
of unwrapped film, does not raise problems. However, sealing the 
circumferential wrapper to the end covers at the respective marginal 
zones requires a great precision in the location of the respective 
elements in order to obtain a light-proof seal. Other types of daylight loading film packages are known that 
comprise two flanges and a circumferential wrapper sealed to the 
peripheral edge of the flanges. The flanges must have a substantial 
thickness to obtain a sufficiently strong seal. An example of 
suchlike package is disclosed in EP-A-03 26 260 of Sony Corp. A 
similar daylight loading film package with two end discs is 
disclosed in DE 41 33 530 C1 of Du Pont de Nemours GmbH, DE. This 
latter invention comprises the use of end discs with an annular  
 
recess at their outside and of a flexible circumferential wrapper 
that is tensioned during its winding around the wound film roll so 
that its lateral, free margins will shrink and fold, and become 
located in wrinkled form in the annular recesses of the flanges. 
The light-tightness of this package leaves to desire since the 
wrinkled margins inevitably comprise overlapping portions, the most 
outer portions being not in

<CLAIMS>
A lighttight package (10) of a rolled light-sensitive 
material, which comprises a core (12), a light-sensitive web (9) 

wound on the core, a light-shielding circumferential wrapper (17) to 
shield the circumferential surface of the wound web from ambient 

light and a pair of light-shielding flanges to shield the side 
surfaces of the wound web, characterised in that the light-shielding 

flanges (13, 14) have a circumferential groove (20, 21) 
into which a folded margin (18, 19) of the circumferential cover is 

seated and withheld. 
A lighttight package according to claim 1, wherein said 
outside wall sections (22, 23) have a larger diameter than said 

inside wall sections (24, 25). 
A lighttight package according to claim 2, wherein the 
outside wall sections (22, 23) of the light-shielding flanges 

determining the circumferential grooves are sufficiently deformable 
to allow their urging away from the corresponding inside wall 

sections (24, 25) for widening the grooves (20, 21) and facilitating 
insertion of a folded margin of the circumferential cover. 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein said circumferential grooves have a widened inlet opening 

(28). 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein said circumferential grooves have a widened bottom (29). 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein said circumferential grooves have opposed wall sections that 

perform a clamping action on the folded margin of the 
circumferential cover. 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein said folded margin (19) comprises an inwardly (30) and an 

outwardly (31) folded portion.  
 
A lighttight packaging according to claim 7, wherein a chord 
(32) is provided in the groove (35) formed by the inwardly and 

outwardly folded portions of the margins of the circumferential 
wrapper. 
A lighttight package according to claim 8, wherein said 
chord (32) is removable prior to the first use of the package. 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
wherein said flanges comprise a plain section (26) and a coaxial 

ring-like section (23) at the outside thereof, said ring-like 
section defining with a corresponding portion (25) of the plain 

section the circumferential groove (21). 
A lighttight package according to claim 10, wherein said 
ring-like part (23) is more flexible than said plain part. 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 11, 
wherein said flanges have a hub (15, 16) fitting in the core. 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
wherein the fitting of the hubs (15, 16) of the flanges in the core 

(12) is rotatable. 
A lighttight package according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
wherein the circumferential cover has a trailing edge which is 

attached to the leading edge (36) of the rolled web, and a leading 
end which is not attached and is operative as a leader for starting 

the unwinding of the wound web, thereby to enable the package to be 
used as a daylight loading package.
