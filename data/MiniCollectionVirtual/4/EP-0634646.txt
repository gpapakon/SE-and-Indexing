Sample water is supplied to an oxidative 
decomposer(202), heated to 90 °C under presence of a 

photooxidation catalyst, and irradiated with ultraviolet 
radiation by a low pressure mercury lamp (226) while being 

supplied with air, to cause photooxidative decomposition 
reaction. After the reaction, nitric acid ions are 

measured with an absorption photometer at a wavelength of 
220 nm. Then, a color developer is added to the sample 

water, and the colored solution is employed for 
measurement of phosphoric ions with the absorption

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
analyzing small quantities of a nitrogen compound and a
phosphorus compound which are contained in industrial
waste water from a factory or the like, or environmental
water such as river or lake, and an apparatus therefor.In Japan, a method of analyzing a nitrogen compound
and a phosphorus compound which are contained in water is
officially standardized under JIS K0102 and Notification
No. 140 of the Environment Agency. A nitrogen compound
which is contained in water exists in the form of nitric
acid ions, nitrous acid ions, ammonium ions or organic
nitrogen. While a TN (total nitrogen) analytical method
of measuring total nitrogen which is contained in water
is adapted to entirely convert the nitrogen compound to
nitric acid ions to measure the same, it is difficult to
oxidize ammonium ions and organic nitrogen into nitric 
acid ions. In TN measurement, therefore, an alkaline
potassium peroxodisulfate solution is added to sample
water, which in turn is heated at 120*C for 30 minutes so
that the nitrogen compound is entirely oxidized into
nitric acid ions. Then the sample water is cooled and
thereafter adjusted to pH 2 to 3, to be subjected to
measurement of ultraviolet absorbance by nitric acid ions
at a wavelength of 220 nm.On the other hand, a phosphorus compound which is
contained in water exists in the form of phosphoric acid
ions, hydrolytic phosphorus, or organic phosphorus. In
TP (total phosphorus) measurement, potassium
peroxodisulfate is added as an oxidizer to sample water
in a neutral state, and the sample water is heated at 120
°C for 30 minutes so that the phosphorus compound is
entirely oxidized to phosphoric acid ions. Since
phosphoric acid ions have no specific light absorption,
an ammonium molybdate solution and an L-ascorbic acid
solution are added as color developers to the sample
water after cooling to color the same, thereby measuring
absorbance at a wavelength of 880 nm.Another TN measuring method is adapted to oxidize a
nitrogen compound to nitric acid ions by an oxidation
catalyst under a high temperature of at least 500 °C for
measuring the same as nitrogen oxides by a 
chemiluminescence method, or to pass nitrogen oxides
further through an oxidation-reduction reaction tube at
about 600 °C and decompose the same to gaseous nitrogen
for measuring the same as nitrogen by gas chromatography.Still another method is adapted to supply ozone to
sample water for oxidizing the same with ozone in an
alkaline state in TN measurement or an
