<ABSTRACT>
In a video recorder (2) having a tuner (20), a recording and playback device (34), a connecting device (4) to which a television receiver (3) can be connected and an operating mode switching device (65) for switching on the "recording" and "playback" operating modes and other operating modes and having a control signal generating device (73) for generating a playback control signal V(Pb) when the "replay" operating mode is switched on in the video recorder (2), a time window generating device (105) for generating a time window with a predetermined time window length (T) is additionally provided in the video recorder (2), which time window generating device is controlled by the operating mode switching device (65) in such a manner that the time window generating device (105) generates, as a consequence of the triggering of the switching-on of at least one predetermined operating mode, a time window, the time window generating device (105) activating the control signal generating device (73) for the duration of the time window length (T) of the time window.

<CLAIMS>
A video recorder (2) having a tuner (20a) which can be tuned to each time
one station of a plurality of stations and, after it has been tuned to a station, supplies a

received television program signal, having a recording and playback device (34) for
recording a received television program signal supplied by the tuner (20a) and for

reproducing a recorded television program signal, and having a connector (4) which can
be connected to the tuner (20a) for applying to said connector the received television

program signal supplied by the tuner (20a), to which connector a cable (6) can be
connected, which cable can also be connected to a connector (5) of a television receiver

(3), which television receiver also has a tuner (77a) which can be tuned to each time
one station of a plurality of 
stations and, after it has been tuned to a station, supplies a
received television program signal, which is reproduced by the television receiver (3) in

a first reproduction mode thereof, the cable (6) enabling signals to be transferred away
from the video recorder (2) and to the video recorder (2), and having a mode selection

device (65) by means of which the video recorder (2) can be set to a "recording" mode,
in which a received television program signal supplied by the tuner (20a) is recorded, to

a "playback" mode, in which a recorded television program signal is reproduced, and to
further modes of operation, and having a control signal generator (73), which generates

and supplies a playback control signal (V(Pb)) when the video recorder (2) is in the
"playback" mode, which playback control signal together with a television program

signal reproduced in the "playback" mode in the video recorder (2) can be applied to
the connector (4) of the video recorder (2), from which the playback control signal

(V(Pb)) can be applied to a detection device (101) of the television receiver (3) via the
cable (6) and the connector (5) of the television receiver (3), which detection device is

adapted to detect the playback control signal (V(Pb)), in which television receiver (3) a
second reproduction mode can be started upon detection of the playback control signal

(V(Pb)) to reproduce the television program signal transferred to the television receiver
(3) via the cable (6), characterized in that the video recorder (2) has a time window

generator (105) for generating a time window of a given time window length (T), and in 
that the mode selection device (65) controls the time window generator (105) in such a

manner that the time window generator (105) automatically generates the time window
of the given time window length (T) at least one time as a result of the initiation of the

activation of at least one given mode which deviates from the "playback" mode and
which can be activated by means of the mode selection device, and in that the time

window generator (105) controls the control signal generator (73) in such a manner that
the control signal generator (73) also generates and supplies the playback control signal

(V(Pb)) if the time window generator (105) generates the time window.
A video recorder as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that in response
to the initiation of the activation of the "recording" mode the mode selection device (65)

activates the time window generator (105) to generate the time window (Figs. 1, 2, 4,
5).
A video recorder as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that there
has been provided a detection device (108) which is adapted to detect the initiation a

tuning operation of the tuner (20a) of the video recorder (2) to another station by means
of the mode selection device (65) within the given time window length (T) of the time

window generated by means of the time window generator (105) as a result of the
initiation of the activation of at least one given mode of operation, and in that said

detection device (108) controls the time window generator (105) in such a manner that
at the instant at which the initiation of a tuning operation of the tuner (20a) of the video

recorder (2) to another station is detected the time window generator (105) is reset and
again generates the time window of the given time window length (T) (Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5;

7).
