<ABSTRACT>
A method and improved system for controlling an 
inserter having a plurality of functional devices, including 

the steps providing a control system that divides the 
inserter into a plurality of logical stations each of which 

control at least one of the functional devices, separating 
the control system into a top-level, generic supervisor 

which is operative independent of the functional devices, 
and a lower level comprising the logical stations, and 

storing the supervisor and the logical stations in a central 
processor, the supervisor being operative for selecting an 

appropriate one of the logical stations at an appropriate 
time whereby the selected one of the logical stations 

controls a corresponding one of the functional devices. The 
method further includes the steps of providing a plurality 

of distributed processors electrically coupled to the 
central processor and associated with the functional 

devices, and controlling the functional devices by the 
logical stations through the distributed processors.

<DESCRIPTION>
Inserter systems, which assemble batches of documents
for insertion into envelopes, are known in the art and are
generally used by organizations which make large mailings
where the contents of each envelope may vary. Large
multi-station inserter systems typically include some or all
of the following: a plurality of feeder modules for feeding
sheets into a batch; a web module for separating webs into
discreet sheets and feeding the discrete sheets into the
batch; folder modules for folding individual sheets or
batches; an envelope module for feeding envelopes into which
the batches are to be inserted; a transport system for
conveying the batches through the various modules of the
inserter system; an insertion module for inserting the
batches into envelopes; and meter modules for metering the
filled envelopes with appropriate postage. Additionally,
multi-station inserter systems may include modules for
assembling a collation of sheets fed from a feeder module
for further processing, and modules for turning the sheets
or envelopes for further processing. A control system is
used-to synchronize the operation of the various modules in
the inserter system to assure that the batches are properly
assembled, inserted into envelopes and, possibly, metered,
at a high rate.Although the types of modules used in the inserter
system are generally standardized, the configuration of the 
inserter systems are not. Typically, the multi-station
inserter systems are configured to meet a particular
application of each customer. Thus, the configuration of
such inserter systems varies depending on the customer and
the particular application for the inserter system by the
customer. In customizing large inserter systems using
generally standardized modules the flexibility of the
control system to easily adapt to any configuration changes
is most important.In U.S. Patent No. 4,547,856, issued on October 15,
1985 to Piotroski et al., and assigned to the assignee of
the present invention, there is disclosed a universal
multi-station document inserter, including a central
processor interconnected to a plurality of distributed
processors associated with the inserter modules. A
supervisory program operating in the central processor
controls the modules of the inserter in accordance with
instructions programmed into the distributed processors
associated therewith. The supervisory program capable of
running all the modules of the inserter and performing all
control functions is stored in plug-in PROMS which are
coupled to the central
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A document inserter including a plurality of functional
devices (30) and distributed processor means operatively coupled to

each of the functional devices, and central processing means
connected to the distributed processor means and having stored

therein a supervisory program capable of real-time control of all
the functional devices (30), characterized in that said central

processing means includes a control system (10) comprising:

a supervisor (14) which generically controls the inserter as a
group of independent functional devices (30); and
a plurality of logical stations (20) that are operatively
controlled by said supervisor (14), each of said stations (20)

interfacing with one of the distributed processor means for
controlling at least one of the functional devices (30), wherein

each of said stations (20) includes a station record containing complete
information for the or each functional device (30) being controlled

thereby.
The inserter of Claim 1, wherein said station record includes
station configuration data, pointers to device functions that are

performed by the functional devices (30) and an instant when to
perform said device functions, and collation data pointers to when a

collation is at a functional device (30) controlled by the station
(20).
The inserter of Claim 2, wherein a user interface (12) is
provided for sending said configuration data to said supervisor

reflecting configuration of the inserter as selected by an operator,
said supervisor (14) being arranged to initialize said stations (20)

in accordance with said configuration data. 
The inserter of any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein said
supervisor (14) includes a machine event handler arranged to operate

on an interrupt basis, said machine event handler being operable to
call a particular station (20) to perform a specific one of said

device functions based on an interrupt count.
The inserter of Claim 4 as dependent on Claim 2, wherein each
of said stations (20) is arranged to send a specific functional

signal to an associated functional device (30) at the appropriate
time based on the interrupt count matching said instant stored in

said station record when said device function is to be performed.
A method of supervisory control of a document
inserter including a plurality of functional devices, comprising the

steps of:

providing a central processor; and
providing a control system that divides the inserter into a
plurality of logical stations each of which control at least one of

the functional devices;

   characterized by:
separating the control system into a top-level, generic
supervisor which is operative independent of the functional devices,

and a lower level comprising said logical stations; and
storing said supervisor and said logical stations in the
central processor, said supervisor being operative for selecting an

appropriate one of said logical stations at an appropriate time
whereby said selected one of said logical stations controls a

corresponding one of said functional devices.
The method of claim 6, comprising the further
steps:


providing a plurality of distributed processors
electrically coupled to the central processor and associated

with said functional devices, said logical stations

processors.
The method of claim 6, comprising the further
steps of:


providing configuration data to said supervisor

inserter; and
initializing said logical stations in accordance with

said configuration data.
The method of claim 8, comprising the further
steps of:


providing a station record for each of said logical
stations in the central processor; and
initializing each of said station records with
respective station configuration data and pointers to device

functions that are performed by the functional devices
controlled by the respective logical station.
The method of claim 9, comprising the further
