<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A known throttle valve body has a plurality of return springs which are intended to move the throttle valve into an emergency-running position by means of auxiliary levers, an electric-motor drive being provided which takes up power and installation space. 2.2 In contrast, the new throttle valve body has the features that the spring force is provided by a clip spring (14), the two ends (15, 16) of which jointly grasp a motor-lever stud (17) and a housing stud (18). 2.3 The throttle valve body has a small electric motor.

<CLAIMS>
Throttle venturi control unit with an accelerator-pedal 
and electromotive drive, the latter acting upon a motor 

lever (6) which in neutral position assumes an emergency 
running position, which is fixed by spring action and 

adjusts a throttle lever (8) in such a way that the 
throttle valve (3) undergoes a corresponding emergency 

running opening, the electromotive drive being capable of 
displacing the motor lever (6) counter to the spring 

action in the direction of an opening or closing position 
of the throttle valve (3), 
characterized in
 that the 
spring action is provided by a clamping spring (14) 

which, with its two ends (15, 16), jointly embraces a 
motor lever journal (17) and a housing journal (18). 
Throttle venturi control unit according to claim 1, 

characterized in
 that the clamping spring (14) is 
supported in or on a bush (19) which, as an intermediate 

element, comprises a stop (20) for one of the spring 
limbs (15, 16) and a stop (21) for the motor lever 

journal (17) as well as a stop (22) for the housing 
journal (18). 
Throttle venturi control unit according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that clamping spring (14) and motor 
lever (6) are disposed concentrically relative to the 

throttle valve shaft (2). 
Throttle venturi control unit according to claim 2, 

characterized in
 that the throttle lever (8) is held by a 
spring (9), which is clamped in between throttle lever 

(8) and motor lever (6), against a motor lever stop (10) 
and, upon operation of the accelerator pedal beyond an 

opening amount of the throttle valve (2) adjusted by the 
motor lever (6), lifts off from said motor lever stop 

(10).
