<ABSTRACT>
A quantization apparatus for quantizing and word length 
limiting digitized stereo input signals including a stereo 

dither signal generating unit for generating stereo dither 
signals synthesized from at least two distinct dither signals 

not correlated to each other at an arbitrary ratio, a first 
addition unit for adding one of the stereo dither signals to 

one of the digital stereo input signals, a second addition unit 
for adding the other of the stereo dither signals to the other 

of the digital stereo input signals, a first quantization unit 
for quantizing and word length limiting an output signal of the 

first addition unit, and a second quantization unit for 
quantizing and word length limiting an output signal of the 

second addition unit. With the present quantization device, 
the stereo input signals may be quantized while 

cross-correlation between the left and right channel stereo 
input signals is maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a quantization apparatus and,
more particularly, to a quantization apparatus in which
digitized stereo input signals are processed with quantization
and word length limitation.In certain prior-art apparatus for quantization, a dither
addition circuit is provided for improving reproducibility by
alleviating dropout of the information of weak intensity
signals produced on quantization and word length limitation.With such quantization apparatus, as disclosed in JP
Patent Kokai (laid-Open) Patent Publication No.05-145376
(1993) (GB-A-2 261 783), a dither addition circuit is provided upstream of a
quantizer for adding dither signals to digital data in order to
prevent failure in the waveform or level shifting and
consequent deterioration in reproducibility due to word length
limitation by rounding or half-adjustment during quantization
of digital data by the quantizer and consequent dropout in the
information contained in substantially sinusoidal
pre-quantization weak-intensity signals. In this case, if,
after quantization of the dither signals added to the digital
data, a pre-set number of the lower bits are rounded or
half-adjusted, the information proper to the minute or
weak-intensity signals contained in the input signal is left
in the quantized data for further alleviating the failure in
the information of the minute weak-intensity signals induced by
the word length limitation.If, when the right-channel digital stereo signals and
the left-channel digital stereo signals are supplied to a 
quantizer for the right channel and to a quantizer for the left
channel, respectively, the same dither signals or dither
signals not correlated with each other are supplied to
left-channel and right-channel dither addition circuits
provided upstream of the quantizers, the correlation between
the left and right channels, proper to the stereo input
signals, is deteriorated.For example, if the same dither signals, having the
cross-correlation coefficient equal to unity, are supplied to
the left and right dither addition signals, the
cross-correlation of signal components having inherently low
left channel- right channel correlation is increased.
Specifically, the ambience feeling created by the reverberating
stereophonic components in music signals is not spread
sufficiently towards left and right, but is collected towards a
center position.On the other hand, if the dither signals not correlated
with each other, such as the dither signals having the cross-correlation
coefficient equal to zero,
