<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for manufacturing
ceramic tiles, and more specifically to a method for forming tiles
of uniform compaction and thickness. The invention also relates
to the means for implementing said method.Ceramic tiles in general are known to be formed in convenient
moulds positioned on suitable forming presses. In modern
production cycles said presses are hydraulic and basically
comprise:
a bed supporting the lower and intermediate mould plates;two vertical columns connected together at their top by a
fixed cross-member;a vertically movable cross-member slidingly mounted on said
columns and to the bottom of which the mould upper plate is fixed;
anda hydraulic cylinder-piston unit secured to said fixed cross-member
and slidingly driving said movable cross-member.In such hydraulic presses the operating pressure of said cylinder-piston
unit can be adjusted as required, ie on the basis of the
parameters for the work underway.The moulds to be associated with said presses comprise the three
said plates, of which the intermediate plate comprises at least
one forming cavity to be charged with at least one material to be
compacted, the lower plate comprises at least one die to define
the base of said at least one cavity and to form one of the two 
tile faces, and the upper plate is provided with at least one die
to form the other tile face.In all cases said at least one material is charged by a carriage
arranged to occupy a first position to the side of the die plate,
where it receives said at least one material, and a second
position overlying the die plate, where it discharges said at
least one material into said at least one cavity.The to-and-fro movement of the carriage is generated by a
connecting rod-crank system operated by a convenient drive unit,
the carriage consisting of a rectangular frame with flaps fixed to
two opposing sides thereof. Normally said flaps are fixed to
those two sides of the frame which are parallel to the carriage
movement. A feed hopper for said material is also associated with
said carriage.In certain cases the hopper is stationary and the respective
carriage comprises a rear horizontal plate arranged to close and
open the discharge mouth of the hopper when the carriage is in its
advanced or discharge position and, respectively, when the
carriage is in its withdrawn or loading position.In other cases the hopper is arranged to move relative to the
carriage with reciprocating rectilinear motion parallel to the
carriage movement.The depth of the
