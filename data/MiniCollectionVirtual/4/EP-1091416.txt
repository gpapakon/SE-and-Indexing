<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed, in general, to
semiconductor fabrication and, more specifically, to a gallium
arsenide metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (GaAs
MOSFET) having low capacitance and on-resistance and method of
manufacturing the same.Power conversion circuitry commonly employed in a variety
of electronic circuits. Integrated circuits (ICs) are no
exception and large demand for improved functionality and
enhanced performance continues to increase. In an effort to
meet these demands, the IC industry continues to decrease the
size of component devices to place more circuits in the same
amount of space. Over the last several years, structures have
diminished from 1.2m gate areas to gate areas of 0.25m and
promise to become even smaller in the future.The ever-increasing demand for smaller components places
strict operating constraints on individual devices. As power
converter circuitry continues to shrink, minimizing the factors
that increase both the resistance and the total capacitance of
the power switching device becomes critical.Currently, power switching devices built on silicon suffer
from such resistance and capacitance problems, which limit
further improvement. The resistance of the silicon substrate is
inherently higher than desired. Furthermore, the vertical
structuring of the layers from which such devices are composed
causes high channel resistance and undesirable drift region
resistance. For instance, as circuit integration approaches the
0.5 Âµm level, the drift resistance between source and drain 
regions of the device is the dominant performance limiting
factor.However, when low blocking-voltage, typically less than
100 V, designs are desired, the channel resistance also becomes
a significant portion of the overall device resistance.
Therefore, if drift resistance can be reduced, power switching
devices having reduced channel resistance will also be required
for low-voltage applications. Channel resistance appears to be
limited by the characteristics of the gate oxide interface.
High temperature annealing steps produce a rough interface
between the oxide and underlying doped regions. Much effort has
been expended in the search for processes that reduce the
interface irregularities. Also, gate oxide materials having
inherently better interface characteristics have been sought.
Such efforts have met with moderate success as evidenced by the
limitations of current state-of-the-art devices.Accordingly, what is needed in the art is a device for
power switching
