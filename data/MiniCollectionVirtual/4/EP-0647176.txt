Process for manufacturing a set E of solid three-dimensional 
parts by phototransformation of a 

polymerisable or crosslinkable liquid organic material, 
by means of light absorption by polymerisation or cross-linking 

photoinitiators, comprising: 

a) at least one source of light radiation 
b) means for automatically creating and 
superimposing fine layers of the material 
c) optical means enabling the light emitted by a) 
to be confined in the form of at least one point of 

impact on the material 
d) means for automatically moving said point(s) of 
impact on the material 
e) a calculating and memorising system making it 
possible to: 


memorise the geometric shape of the set E 
calculate a set of elementary volumes such that, 
once they have been phototransformed, these elementary 

volumes together constitute a set F of parts such that E 
is included in F, 
monitor and control all the automatic equipment 
needed for the production, 
 
characterised in that the set F of parts produced for 

the manufacture of the set E of desired parts includes a 
set G of solid granules which, during the manufacturing 

stage, form a more or less fine powder (of the material 
once it has been phototransformed) mixed with the 

material which is still in liquid form, these granules 
not necessarily all having the same geometric shape. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the set F (parts actually produced) includes a set C 

containing at least one enclosure (leaktight hollow part 
made in one piece or made up of a plurality of connected 

parts).  
 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
at least one of the elements of C completely encloses at 

least one element of E (one of the desired parts). 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the volume enclosed by at least one element of C is 

entirely in liquid form at the end of the manufacturing 
operation. 
Process according to claims 3 and 4, characterised 
in that each element of G (solid granules) is located 

inside an element of C (enclosure). 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that 
at least one element of C encloses a volume occupied 

solely by elements of C and/or E, and/or by the medium V 
(made up of elements of G). 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the elements of set G interlock with one another. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
at least one element of C is made up of a plurality of 

connected parts joined together by a fixing system which 
is easily broken apart or opened. 
Process according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the fixing system is a hinge. 
Process according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the fixing system is a bridge of material which is fine 

enough to be broken manually without effort.
