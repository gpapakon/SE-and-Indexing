<ABSTRACT>
In a motion vector detecting apparatus, an input 
video signal is subsampled by a subsampling circuit, sampled 

data are Fourier-transformed by a discrete Fourier transform 
circuit to frequency area data, data for the previous frame, 

which is stored by a memory, data of the current frequency 
area are divided by a divider, a quotient is then inverse 

Fourier-transformed by an inverse discrete Fourier transform 
means and reflected to the real-time area, and, using the 

information from this real-time area, a first judging circuit 
determines whether there are any motion vectors, and if there 

are determines the magnitude and direction of the vectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion vector
detecting method in image signal processing.Methods for detecting the amount of displacement in
an image screen by comparing the current frame with the
previous frame on a frequency area basis have been proposed
as a means of applying signal processing appropriate to
specific image properties in the field of image signal
processing technologies, and particularly signal processing
technologies applied to moving images (see "Digital signal
processing of images, revised and enlarged version," Fukinuke
Takahiko, Nikkan Kogyo Shimbunsha, pp. 223-224).This conventional method of motion vector detection
whereby images are compared in a specific frequency area to
detect the amount of displacement in an image is described
below.Fig. 8 is a block diagram of a conventional
apparatus detecting motion vectors in a frequency area.
Referring to Fig. 8, a discrete Fourier transform means 81
applies a discrete Fourier transformation to an input video
signal 800. A memory 82 stores one frame of data. A divider 
83 takes as inputs the outputs from the discrete Fourier
transform means 81 and the memory 82, and divides the values
for each sampling point. A judge circuit 84 takes the output
of the divider 83 as its input, and determines the presence
of a motion vector in the divider 83 output; if a motion
vector is present, the judge circuit 84 then determines the
magnitude and direction of the vector.The motion vector detection apparatus thus comprised
operates as follows. Fig. 9 is used to describe motion vector
detection apparatus operation. Referring to Fig. 9, the
signal level of the input image signal at position x in one
image frame 91 at time n is expressed as f(x) where x is a
two-dimensional vector expressed as x = (x1, x2). Image frame
92 is the frame at time (n+1). The difference between n and
(n+1) expresses the time interval of one frame to the next
frame. The signal level of the image at time (n+1) at
position x is expressed as g(x). A Fourier transform result
93 is obtained by the discrete Fourier transform means 81
applying a discrete Fourier transformation to one image frame
91 at time n. If the Fourier transform result is expressed
as F(ω), the Fourier transform equation is defined by equation
1.
F(ω) = ∫ƒ(x)e-jωx dxNote that equation 1 is the definition when x is a
continuous variable. While x is a discrete value in a digital 
system, the characteristics of the equation is essentially the
same whether x is a continuous or discrete variable, and x
is
