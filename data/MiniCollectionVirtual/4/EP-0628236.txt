An implement with a frame (12), especially an agricultural ground-working 
implement, with a lift device having a lift cylinder (26) for adjusting the frame (12) 

between a transport position and at least one working position and with an adjustable 
depth control (50) for the current working position, which comprises a rocker (52) 

adjustable indirectly or directly in dependence on the position of the piston rod of the 
lift cylinder (26) and a valve (54) with an actuating element (58), wherein the valve 

(54) is connected to the lift cylinder (26) and to a pressure source and blocks 
movement of the piston rod in at least one direction on a predetermined movement of 

the actuating element (58) by the rocker (52), characterized in that the rocker (52) is 
pivoted on the frame (12) and receives an actuating member (60) which can be moved 

with the rocker (52) and can shift the actuating element (58) of the valve (54) with 
movement of the rocker (52) and is adjustable relative to the rocker (52) from a 

position which is remote from the rocker (52). 
An implement according to claim 1, characterized in that the rocker (52) is 
pivoted on the frame (12) for limited pivotal movement and has a contact element (74), 

against which an arm (42e) provided on the piston rod of the lift cylinder (26) comes 
into abutment in the range of working settings of the implement (10). 
An implement according to claim 1, characterized in that the actuating member 
(60) has a threaded section for reception of a nut (90) which is connected to the rocker 

(52) and is provided at one end with a contact surface (102) for actuating the actuating 
element (58) of the control valve (54) and with a rotating device in the region of the 

other end. 
An implement according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the rocker (52) has a triangular or approximately triangular shape and is 

connected to the frame (12) to pivot vertically, the pivotal bearing point (72) being 
provided in the region of the lower corner, the nut (90) being pivotally mounted at the 

upper corner and the contact element (74) being the form of a rod movable against the  
 

bias of a spring (74s) in a cylindrical part (75) at the front corner of the rocker (52). 
An implement according to claim 4, characterized in that a stop (80) is 
provided on the rocker (52) to the rear of the pivotal bearing point (72) and limits the 

rotary movement of the rocker (52) away from the actuating element (58) of the 
control valve (54). 
An implement according to claim 3, characterized in that a spacer (104) is 
provided on the actuating member (60) between the nut (90) and the contact surface 

(102). 
An implement according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the lift cylinder (26) is single acting and when pressurised moves the implement 

(10) into its transport position, while the control valve (54) prevents return flow of 
fluid from the lift cylinder (26) when its actuating element (58) is moved by the 

actuating member (60). 
An implement according to claim 3, characterized in that the actuating member 
(60) is provided with a depth indicator (96) in the region of its turning device.
