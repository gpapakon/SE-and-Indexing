<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to brush seal devices for sealing a high
pressure area from a low pressure area, the sealed
fluids being gas or liquid, and to an apparatus using said brush
seal devices, of the types as described in the preambles of the independent claims.Over the last decade, brush seals have emerged to be a very
promising technology for sealing high pressure areas from low
pressure areas such as those found in gas turbine engines.
Indeed, there is a substantial reduction, e.g., an order of
magnitude, in brush seal leakage flow over the present day
technology of labyrinth seals, the main disadvantage associated
with labyrinth seals being that the clearance of the seal around
the shaft tends to increase appreciably over time due to shaft
excursions and thermal growth. The resulting increase in
parasitic leakage can cause as much as 17 percent loss in power
and 7.5 percent increase in specific fuel consumption in the case
of engines.Typically, brush seals inhibit the flow of a gas (or liquid)
in a stream along a shaft. The gas (or liquid) is sealed, for
example, within a machine housing and has a system pressure. The
area outside of the sealed machine housing toward which the sealed
gas will tend to leak has a discharge pressure, the system
pressure being greater than the discharge pressure. A brush seal device and an apparatus using this brush seal device of the above-defined
type is described in GB-A-2 021 210. The brush seal comprises a plurality of tightly-packed
bristles sandwiched in a space between a pair of axially-spaced annular side-plates.
The distance between the annular side-plates is varied from a small distance far
away from the circumferential surface of the shaft to be sealed toward a greater distance
adjacent to the shaft to be sealed. This variation in the distance between the two plates
is calculated such that the space between adjacent bristles is kept constant along the
whole length of the bristles. The bristles are adapted to be in contact with both side-plates,
even if no pressure differential is applied thereto.GB-A-1 598 926 describes a brush seal sandwiched between a back plate and a
retaining plate such that the bristles are supported by the back plate even in the case of
zero pressure differential over the seal. The retaining plate has a recess formed in its
second side, i.e. in its side facing the low pressure area. The recessed surface is
adapted to expose the bristles to the pressure of the high pressure side of the seal.
Consequently, the bristles are moved
