<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol is used to prepare highly 
polymeric linear condensation polymers by reaction with 
terephthalic acid and is useful as an intermediate in the 
preparation of certain polyester and polyester amides. The 
use of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol for such purposes is 
disclosed in, for example, US-A-2901466. This document 
teaches that the trans-isomer of polycyclohexylenedimethylene 
terephthalate has a higher melting point range 
(315°-320°C) than the corresponding cis-isomer (260°-267°C). One method for preparing 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol 
(hexahydroterephthalyl alcohol) involves the hydrogenation 
of diethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate (diethyl 
hexahydroterephthalate) in a slurry phase reactor in the 
presence of a copper chromite catalyst at a pressure of 3000 
psia (about 206.84 bar) and a temperature of 255°C, as is 
described in Example 3 of US-A-2105664. The yield is said 
to be 77.5%. The hydrogenation of dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate 
(DMCD) to 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) is 
shown below in equation (1):- 
 
The two geometrical isomers of CHDM thus produced are:  
 
The resulting 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol product is 
a mixture of these two isomers which have different melting 
points. As reported on page 9 of the book "Fiber Chemistry" 
edited by Menachem Lewis and Eli M. Pearce, published by 
Marcel Dekker, Inc.: "Both the alicyclic ester [i.e. 
dimethyl 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylate] and the alicyclic 
diol [i.e.1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol] exist in two isomeric 
forms, cis ... and trans ..., that are not interconvertible 
without bond rupture". The passage continues later: 
"Control of the [cis-:trans-] ratio is important [in 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol] 
since many polymer and fiber 
properties depend on it". The cis-isomer of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol has a 
melting point of 43°C and the trans has a melting point of 
67°C. The higher melting point trans-isomer is often 
preferred over the cis-isomer for use as a reagent in the 
preparation of polyester and polyester-amides if a high 
melting point for such materials is considered desirable. 
As noted above, the trans-isomer of a typical polyester, 
such as trans-polycyclohexylmethyl terephthalate, has a 
higher melting point than the cis-isomer. Hence, for 
example, US-A-5124435 discloses a polyester copolymer, the 
1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol content of which has a trans-isomer 
content of at least 80 mole %, and which has a high
