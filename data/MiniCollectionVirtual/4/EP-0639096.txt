<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a distillation apparatus (1) which is suitable in particular for the distillation of sea water into fresh water. The apparatus comprises a plurality of flat, bag-like elements (3) formed from a thin film material such as plastic film and placed one against the other, the elements serving as heat exchangers between a vaporizing liquid flowing along the exterior surfaces of the element and a condensing vapor directed to the inside of the element, and a compressor (15) for increasing the pressure and temperature of the generated vapor before it is directed to the inside of the elements. The essential idea of the invention is that the inside of each element (3) is divided into parallel vapor ducts (12) extending vertically from one end of the element to the other, into which ducts the vapor is fed from apertures (25) at the upper edge of the element. At the upper end of each element (3) there may be a honeycomb-structured end strip (4) which contains parallel ducts (25) separated from each other by partition walls, the ducts feeding vapor to the inside of the element over the entire width of the element end. The strip (4) may also contain similarly formed ducts (26) which direct the liquid to be evaporated over the entire width of the element surface. At the lower end of the element there may additionally be a honeycomb-structured end strip (7) for collecting the produced distillate and for removing any unvaporized liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
the evaporation of a liquid and for its subsequent condensation, 
the apparatus comprising a plurality of flat, bag-like 
elements of a thin film material, such as plastic film, placed 
one against the other, the elements serving as heat exchangers 
between a vaporizing liquid which flows along the exterior 
surfaces of the elements and a condensing vapor which has been 
directed to the inside of the elements, and a compressor for 
increasing the pressure and temperature of the generated vapor 
before it is directed to the inside of the elements. An apparatus according to the above definition is 
described in, for example, FI Lay-Open Print 79948 and in the 
corresponding International Application Publication WO 
90/01977. The primary use of apparatuses of this 
type has been the production of fresh water from sea water. The 
tube or plate heat exchangers used in the prior art for the 
distillation of sea water were susceptible to contamination, 
and the corrosive nature of sea water caused problems of corrosion 
in them, necessitating the use of expensive, non-corrodible 
materials such as titanium and cupro-nickel. By the 
use of bag-like distillation elements made of plastic film 
these disadvantages have been eliminated, since plastic film is 
inexpensive, non-corrodible and, owing to its resilience, less 
susceptible to contamination. Any contaminant possibly adhering 
to the membranes can be shaken off by varying the pressure prevailing 
inside the elements. It has been possible to compensate 
for the poor thermal conductivity of plastic per se by using in 
the distillation apparatus a very thin film and a large number 
of thin elements having a large heat exchange surface. The distillation apparatus according to said FI Lay-Open Print 
79948 comprises, above the plastic membrane elements, a common 
distribution basin for the water to be evaporated, from which  
 
the liquid flows via pipes into the passages between the elements. 
The vapor generated on the exterior surfaces of the 
elements is directed to a blower, which blows it, at a higher 
pressure and temperature, to the inside of the elements through 
apertures in their sides. The system described has the disadvantage 
that, by means of it, the vapor to be condensed cannot 
be spread very evenly inside the elements, and subsequently 
part of the potential condensing efficiency of the apparatus 
remains unexploited. Also, in the apparatus disclosed, the 
spreading out of the liquid to be
