<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a non-woven layer that consists substantially of short polyolefin fibres the non-woven layer being a felt with in the plane of the layer substantially randomly oriented fibres with a length of 40-100 mm, a tensile strength of at least 1.2 GPa and a modulus of at least 40 GPa. The invention also relates to a method for the manufacture of this felt and to layered structures in which the felt is used. Layered structures comprising a non-woven layer according to the invention have improved specific energy absorption on impact of ballistic projectiles.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-WOVEN LAYER CONSISTING SUBSTANTIALLYOF SHORT POLYOLEFIN FIBRESThe invention relates to a non-woven layer that consists substantially of short polyolefin fibr.es.Such a non-woven layer is known from WO-A-89/01126. This known layer consists of polyolefin fibres, having a length of at most 20.3 cm, which are substantially unidirectionally oriented and are embedded in a polymeric matrix. This known layer is used in layered ballistic- resistant structures.A drawback of this layer is that the specific energy absorption (SEA), that is the energy absorbtion on ballistic impact divided by .the areal density (weight per m2), is still low. Because of this the ballistic-resistant layer must have a high weight per m2 to offer sufficient protection against ballistic impacts. A further drawback is that the layer comprises a matrix, as a result of which it is less flexible and does not breathe as well. Because of this, ballistic-resistant clothing, such as fragment- resistant and bulletproof vests, in which this layer is incorporated is not very comfortable to wear.The aim of the invention is to avoid these drawbacks to a substantial extent. This aim is achieved because the non-woven layer is a felt having in the plane of the layer substantially randomly oriented short fibres with a length of 40- 100 mm, a tensile strength of at least 1.2 GPa and a modulus of at least 40 GPa. A felt is a layer wherein the individual fibres are not assembled together to form a specific structure like obtained when yarns are knitted or woven and which layer does by definition not comprise a matrix. 

 Surprisingly, it has been found that this layer has an improved specific energy absorption (SEA) and is hence very suitable for use in a layered ballistic- resistant structure, in particular for protection against (shell) fragments.'Good ballistic-resistant properties' is hereinafter understood to be in particular a high SEA. In the field of layered ballistic-resistant structures 'high SEA' is generally understood to be an SEA of more than 35 Jm2/kg. The SEA is determined according to test standard Stanag 2920 using a fragment-simulating projectile of 1.1 + 0.02 g. The SEA of the non-woven layer according to the invention is preferably more than 40 Jm2/kg and more preferably more than 50 Jm2/kg and most preferably more than 60 Jm2/kg.The advantage of a. high SEA is that fragments with a certain velocity can be arrested by a layer with a substantially lower areal density. A low areal density is very important for increasing the comfort
