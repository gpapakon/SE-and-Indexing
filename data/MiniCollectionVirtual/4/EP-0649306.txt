<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to new
17-position ester and thioester derivatives of
4-azaandrostan-3-ones and related compounds and the
use of such compounds as 5α-reductase inhibitors.The art reveals that certain undesirable
physiological manifestations, such as acne vulgaris,
seborrhea, female hirsutism, male pattern baldness
and benign prostatic hypertrophy, are the result of
hyperandrogenic stimulation caused by an excessive
accumulation of testosterone or similar androgenic
hormones in the metabolic system. Early attempts
to provide a chemotherapeutic agent to counter the
undesirable results of hyperandrogenicity resulted
in the discovery of several steroidal antiandrogens
having undesirable hormonal activities of their own. 
The estrogens, for example, not only counteract the
effect of the androgens but have a feminizing effect
as well. Non-steroidal antiandrogens have also been
developed, for example, 4'-nitro-3'-trifluoromethylisobutyranilide.
See Neri, et al., Endo., Vol. 91,
No. 2 (1972). However, these products, though devoid
of hormonal effects, are peripherally active, competing
with the natural androgens for receptor sites,
and hence have a tendency to feminize a male host
or the male fetus of a female host.It is now known in the art that the principal
mediator of androgenic activity in some target
organs is 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and that it is
formed locally in the target organ by the action
of testosterone-5α-reductase. It is also known that
inhibitors of testosterone-5α-reductase will serve
to prevent or lessen symptoms of hyperandrogenic
stimulation.A number of 4-aza steroid compounds are
known in the art as 5α-reductase inhibitors. For
example, See U.S. Patent Nos. 2,227,876, 3,239,417,
3,264,301 and 3,285,918; French Patent No. 1,465,544;

J. Pharm. Sci. 63, 4, pp. 620-622 (1974).In addition, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,377,584,
4,220,775, 4,859,681, 4,760,071 and the articles

which are said to
be useful in the treatment of DHT-related hyperandrogenic
conditions.However, despite the suggestion in the
prior art that hyperandrogenic diseases are the
result of a single 5α-reductase, there are reports
