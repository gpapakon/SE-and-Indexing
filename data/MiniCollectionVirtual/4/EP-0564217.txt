<ABSTRACT>
An improved intermediate housing incorporated in a power 
driven hammer drill (1) makes the tool light in weight, 

easily and safely handled, and inexpensive to manufacture. 
The intermediate housing (4) includes a bearing member (41) 

and a cylindrical piston housing member (32) which are 
integrally composed of a synthetic resin having high 

tenacity and excellent heat resistance and wear resistance. 
The intermediate housing (4) further includes a plurality of 

ribs (47, 48) radially extending from the piston housing 
member (32) for strengthening against stress applied onto 

the piston housing member (32). In the intermediate housing 
(4) thus constructed, the bearing member (41) has at least 

one opening for feeding an air flow generated by a fan (70) 
while the piston housing member (32) includes at least one 

air conduit for circulating the air flow, so that 
overheating and thermal deformation of the piston housing 

member (32) and the bearing member (41) are prevented in 
continuous operation of the hammer drill.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal structure of 
a power driven hammer drill, and more specifically to an 
intermediate housing disposed between a gear housing and a 
motor housing. A power driven hammer drill generally includes an 
intermediate housing arranged between a gear housing and a 
motor housing as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laying-Open 
Gazette No. 61-172786 by the applicant of the present 
invention. Fig. 9 schematically shows a typical example of 
such conventional power driven hammer drills. The hammer 
drill includes an intermediate housing 204 positioned between 
a gear housing 202 and a motor housing 203. The intermediate 
housing 204 consists of a bearing member 241 for supporting 
an armature shaft 206 of a motor 205 and an intermediate 
shaft 207 and separating a piston cylinder 232 from the motor 
205, and a cylindrical piston housing member 242 protruded 
from the bearing member 241 for supporting a rotating tool 
holder 230 and a reciprocating piston cylinder 232. The intermediate housing is required to have sufficient 
strength and durability, and is generally composed of a metal 
such as aluminum as disclosed in UK Patent Application GB 
2085345. In the conventional metal intermediate housing described 
above, the bearing member 241 and the piston housing member  
 
242 are separately manufactured and assembled later, which 
increases both the cost and labor and makes the hammer drill 
undesirably heavy. Metal outer faces 204a of the 
intermediate housing 204 exposed to the atmosphere may cause 
electric shocks. Another structure of an intermediate housing is disclosed 
in UK Patent Application GB 2085345, in which a bearing 
member and a piston housing member are integrally composed of 
aluminum. The metal intermediate housing of this structure 
also makes the hammer drill undesirably heavy, prevents 
smooth operation of the hammer drill, and requires excessive 
work machining bores and holes, which increase the 
manufacturing cost and labor. Inside the aluminum housing 
member is generally covered with iron or another metal to 
improve the durability, which further increases the 
manufacturing cost. The metal intermediate housing is 
accommodated in a plastic housing to prevent possible 
electric shocks, which enlarges the outer diameter of the 
hammer drill. One object of the invention is thus to provide an improved 
power driven hammer drill which is light in weight and easily 
and safely handled. Another object of the invention is to provide a power 
drive

A power driven hammer drill (1) comprising: an 
electric motor (5); a tool holder (30) for supporting a 

tool bit and transmitting a rotation of said electric motor 
to said tool bit via a driving mechanism comprising an 

intermediate shaft (7); a piston cylinder (32) slidably 
movable along an axis of said power driven hammer drill; an 

air cushion percussive mechanism (33, 34) for converting a 
rotary movement of said electric motor (5) to a 

reciprocating movement of said piston cylinder (32) and 
transmitting said reciprocating movement to said tool bit 

as an axial impact force; and an externally accessible 
switching mechanism (26) for switching off said air cushion 

percussive mechanism, 

said power driven hammer drill further comprising an 
intermediate housing (4) disposed between a gear housing
