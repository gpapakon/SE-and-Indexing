<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an improved method and device used 
in applying gutta percha to a carrier which will later be used in 

filling and sealing an interior of a tooth after a root canal has 
been performed on the tooth. The method consists of inserting 

gutta percha filled cannula 28 into the barrel cavity 24 of a 
syringe-type device 10, heating the cannula in order to increase 

the plasticity of the gutta percha, inserting a carrier 14 into 
the cannula at the dispensing end of the syringe-type device and 

pushing a plunger 34 of the syringe-type device downward in order 
to push the carrier, which is now coated with the gutta percha 

previously contained in the cannula, out of the dispensing end of 
the cannula. The gutta percha coated carrier is then ready for 

use in the root canal. 
An alternate embodiment of the syringe-type device employs 
a modified plunger to accommodate an alternate cannula which is 

provided with its own dispensing cannula plunger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present Invention relates generally to the field of endodontics and more
specifically to a method for preparing a gutta percha coated carrier used in obturating an
extirpated root canal.Current methods of obturating (filling) an extirpated (stripped) root canal commonly
involve packing a root canal with a thermoplastic material, such as gutta percha, so that
the root canal space is filled with the thermoplastic material. Preferably, the space is filled
with the thermoplastic material forming a seal which prevents leakage between the root
canal and the surrounding tissue.It has been found that a satisfactory seal can be formed by softening the gutta
percha by heating it prior to inserting it into the root canal. Normally, the gutta percha
is applied to a carrier prior to insertion into the root canal in order to facilitate insertion.
Carriers precoated with gutta percha are known, as shown by U.S. Patent No. 4,758,156
issued on July 19,1988 to the inventor of the present invention.
However, carriers pre-coated with gutta percha are expensive to
purchase, and a less expensive means is desired for applying gutta percha to a carrier. U.S. Patent 5,067,900 issued November 26, 1991 to inventor, McSpadden, teaches
an inexpensive method of applying gutta percha to a carrier. The McSpadden patent
teaches use of a syringe whose barrel is pre-filled with sufficient gutta percha to coat a
plurality of carriers. According to the teachings of McSpadden, the amount of gutta
percha applied to a carrier is dependent on the force exerted on the plunger of the
syringe and upon the rate of withdrawal of the coated carrier from the discharge end of
the syringe. One problem with this method is that the person coating the carrier must be
steady-handed in order to obtain a uniform and consistent coating of the carrier. Steady
handiness is difficult with the McSpadden device since the entire syringe body is hot due
to the preheating necessary to increase the plasticity of the gutta percha.Also, another problem with multiple usage syringes, such as the McSpadden
syringe,
which forms the basis for the preamble of claim 6,
is that if the carrier is inserted into the root canal to test the sizing fit prior to
applying the gutta percha to the carrier, as is the common practice, it may be coated with
debris that could contaminate the community pool of gutta percha of the syringe. WO-A-9216174 discloses a method and a device for applying gutta percha to a
carrier. The device comprises a barrel containing a quantity of gutta

A method of applying gutta percha (12) to a carrier (14)
comprising:


(a) inserting a cannula (28) (28A) (28B) filled with
gutta percha through a barrel cavity (24) (24B) in a barrel

(16) of a syringe-type device (10) (10A) (10B) until an
upper open end (30) (30B) of the cannula is s
ecured in the
barrel cavity of the syringe-type device and an opposite,

lower, open end of the cannula opens externally of the
device;
(b) heating the gutta percha in order to thermally
increase the plasticity of the normally viscous gutta

percha, which step can be accomplished either before or
after (a);
(c) inserting a plunger (34) (34A) (34B) into the barrel
cavity until it touches the gutta percha;
(d) inserting the carrier into the lower open end of the
cannula; and
(e) pushing the carrier and gutta percha out of the lower
open end of the cannula by means of the plunger.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the lower open end of
the cannula (28) (28A) is adjacent the dispensing end (20) of the

syringe-type device when the upper open end is secured in the
barrel cavity (24).
A method according to claim 1 in which the upper open end
of the cannula (28B) is secured at the dispensing end (20B) of the

device and the lower open end extends outward from the dispensing
end.
A method according to any preceding claim wherein the
cannula (28A) is provided with its own dispensing cannula plunger

(46).
A method according to any preceding claim wherein the
cannula (28) (28A) is inserted into the barrel cavity (24) by
