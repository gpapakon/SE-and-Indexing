<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism 28 for adjusting the tension in a rod 
30 in the neck 21 of a stringed instrument 30 such as a 

guitar comprises a first member 12 attached to one end 
31 of the rod 30 and a second member 11 attached to the 

body of the instrument. The distance between the first 
and second members can be adjusted to vary the tension 

in the rod by means of cam members, comprising chamfered 
blocks 14 and 15 which co-operate with the first member 

12. When the cam members 14,15 are brought together by 
tightening a screw 16, the first and second members are 

forced apart. This increases the tension the rod 30 and 
thus varies the degree of bending of the neck 21. 
The invention also extends to an instrument 
comprising such an adjusting mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjusting
mechanism for a neck aligner for use in a stringed
instrument.It is known that the necks of stringed instruments
are deformed by the tension of the strings which extend
over the stringed instrument, in such a way as to draw
the head part of the neck towards the side of the
instrument bearing the bridge.To counteract this, an aligner is provided in the
neck of the stringed instrument to straighten the
bending deformation of the neck. This aligner, which
comprises a resilient rod member with a high rigidity
inserted into the neck as a truss rod, is adapted to
apply a straightening force to the instrument to
counteract the bending deformation of the neck. The
straightening force is generated by reducing the length
of the truss rod when bending deformation occurs in the
neck.An aligner as described above employing two rod
members is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
Disclosure Gazette (TOKUKAI) Nos. JP-A-1 231 098 and
JP-A-1 234 898,
and an aligner employing one rod member is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Disclosure
Gazette (TOKUKAI) No. JP-A-1 213 697 and Japanese Utility
Model Application Disclosure Gazette No. JP-U-333 488.The above-described aligners are each provided with
an adjusting mechanism for reducing the length of the
truss rod inserted into the neck. The adjusting
mechanism is arranged in a hollow space formed in the
head part of the neck in the above Japanese Patent
Application Disclosure Gazette No. JP-A-1 234 898 and 
Japanese Utility Model Application Disclosure Gazette
No. JP-U-3 33 488, and arranged in the part of the neck
which is connected to the body in Japanese Utility Model
Application Disclosure Gazette No. JP-U-5 838 192. With
these adjusting mechanisms, a user can perform
adjustment by directly inserting an adjusting tool to
the end of the truss rod, through the hollow space of
the head part of the neck or the internal hollow space
of the body.However, there are various types of stringed
instruments in which an internal hollow space cannot be
formed in the body, or the head is not provided with a
hollow space to improve the appearance of the neck, for
example a "Fender"-type guitar. In this type of
stringed instrument, the length of the truss rod cannot
be adjusted while the neck is attached to the body using
the known adjusting mechanisms.Furthermore, stringed instruments in which the user
adjusts the length of the truss rod by inserting a
wrench through the hollow space of the head part of the
neck or the hollow

<CLAIMS>
An adjusting mechanism (28) for a neck aligner in a
stringed instrument (20), wherein the tension in a rod

(30) in the neck of the stringed instrument is varied to
compensate for distortions, the adjusting mechanism

comprising a first member (12) longitudinally movable
with a first end (31) of the rod and a second member

(11) adapted to be prevented from longitudinal movement
relative to the body of the instrument, and means (14,

15, 16) for effecting longitudinal movement of the first
member (12) relative to the second member (11) so as to

vary the tension in the rod.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
means for effecting longitudinal movement (14, 15, 16)

of the first member (12) relative to the second member
(11) comprises cam means.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 2, wherein said cam
means comprises two cam members (14, 15) arranged such

that motion of the cam members towards each other causes
motion of the first and second members (12, 11) away

from each other.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 3, wherein a screw
(16) is provided for moving the cam members (14, 15)

towards and away from each other, the screw passing
through one of the cam members (15) and being threadedly

engaged in the other of the cam members (14), whereby
rotation of the screw causes motion of the cam members

towards and away from each other.
A mechanism as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4,
wherein the first member (12) and the cam members (14,

15) co-operate by means of mutually contacting surfaces
(122, 143; 122', 153) on the first member (12) and the 

cam members (14, 15), the surfaces being inclined
relative to the directions of motion of the first member

and the cam members.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 5, wherein the
second member (11) and the cam members (14, 15) contact

each other by means of surfaces (112, 142, 152) arranged
perpendicular to the axis of the rod (30).
A mechanism as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein said first member (12) and said second member

(11) have through holes (111, 121) through which the rod
(30) passes.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
first end (31) of the rod (30) projecting from the first

member (12) is externally threaded, and engages with an
internally threaded member (13), one end of which abuts

the first member (12).
A stringed instrument comprising an adjusting
mechanism (28) as claimed in any preceding claim.
An instrument as claimed in claim 9, wherein the
adjusting mechanism (28) can be accessed from the

outside of the instrument (20).
