<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an olefin 
polymerization catalyst and a process for preparing a 
polyolefin in the presence of the catalyst. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an olefin 
polymerization catalyst, with which a polyolefin can be 
prepared at a high activity if the amount of an 
organoaluminum oxy-compound to be used is reduced, and the 
resulting polymers do not attach to a wall of a 
polymerization vessel, and it also relates to a process for 
preparing a polyolefin in the presence of the catalyst. The 
attachment of polymers to a wall of a polymerization vessel 
is sometimes referred to as fouling, hereinafter. A process has been known for the preparation of a 
polyethylene and an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer in the 
presence of a metallocene compound and a methyl aluminoxane 
as catalysts. For example, JP-A-58-19309 (The term "JP-A" as 
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application") discloses a process for the preparation of 
ethylene and a copolymer of ethylene and an α-olefin having 
from 3 to 12 carbon atoms in the presence of 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and a linear or  
 
cyclic methyl aluminoxane as catalysts. This preparation 
method provides a high activity per transition metal and a 
good copolymerizability but is disadvantageous from the 
industrial standpoint of view in that the use of a large 
amount of methyl aluminoxane, which is expensive, is 
required. Further, since these catalyst systems comprise a 
uniform system, the resulting polymer is provided in the form 
of fine powder that can be hardly handled and can easily 
cause fouling, making the industrial stable production of 
such a polymer difficult. In order to solve these problems, for example, the 
following attempts have been made to improve aluminoxane: JP-A-61-211307 discloses a process for the 
polymerization of an olefin in the presence of an aluminoxane 
which is a tetracontamer or higher polymer as calculated in 
terms of aluminum unit. JP-A-61-130604, JP-A-60-245604, and JP-A-63-260903 
disclose a preparation process using a halogen-containing 
aluminoxane. JP-A-64-16803 discloses a preparation process using 
an aluminoxane partially crosslinked by water. JP-A-1-240504 discloses a preparation process using a 
heat-treated aluminoxane. JP-A-1-242607 discloses a preparation process using 
an aluminoxane obtained by the reaction of an organoaluminum 
compound, water, and an organic polyhydroxy compound.
