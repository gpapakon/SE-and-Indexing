<ABSTRACT>
A method and a circuit arrangement are specified having a device for measuring the barrier layer temperature of a GTO [gate turn-off thyristor]. In this case, a measuring current (IM) is impressed in the gate circuit and, after the decay of the transient turn-off processes, the voltage (UGR) between the cathode and gate is measured in the presence of the measuring current (IM). This voltage (UGR) is dependent at this point in time on the barrier layer temperature of the GTO. It thus becomes possible to measure the barrier layer temperature directly on the element, that is to say without diversions via cooling body temperature and calculation of the thermal resistance or the like, and continuously during operation and, as a consequence, to monitor and to control precisely the load factor of the GTO.
