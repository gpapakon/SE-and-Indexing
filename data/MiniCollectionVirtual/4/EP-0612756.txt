<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optically active organosilicon compounds which
have anticipated uses as new types of enantio-recognitive materials, and
organopolysilanes which have anticipated uses as polymer standard materials in one-dimensional
semiconductor · quantum wire structures.Numerous organosilicon compounds for industrial use are currently available:
for example, surface treating agents, water-repellent · oil-repellent agents, electric
insulators, thermal media, and precursors of ceramic material, all represent polymers
which incorporate silicon in a portion of their molecular skeletons. Recently,
organopolysilanes which are soluble in certain solvents and which possess main-chains
constructed only of silicon are attracting attention as a new type of functional material.
With regard to this, a large amount of information is being reported relating to research
being conducted on the practical application of the aforementioned organopolysilanes,
such as in photoresists, optical waveguide materials, precursors of silicon carbides,
electrophotographic sensitizing materials, nonlinear optical materials, photoluminescent
materials, and the like.In general, organopolysilane has an ultraviolet absorption band in approximately
the 3 to 4 eV range in the Si-Si chain based on its characteristic main-chain.
The
backbone absorption at room temperature in solution normally displays a molecular
absorption coefficient of approximately 5000 - 8000 (Si repeating unit)-1·dm3·cm-1,
with a full width at half maximum of approximately 0.5 - 0.6 eV (approximately 40 -
60 nm). In contrast, the photoluminescence full width at half maximum of the
backbone at room temperature in solution is approximately 0.1 - 0.2 eV (approximately
10 - 20 nm), which is quite narrow when compared to the backbone absorption. In
other words, the photoluminescence spectrum and the absorption spectrum of
organopolysilane do not display a mirror image relationship as seen from the absorption
photoluminescence phenomenon of normal organic material.The reasons for this have been previously clarified as a result of extensive
research in that a main-chain of organopolysilane with trans zig-zag or loose helical
structures behave as a collection of various segments aggregate which is formed by 
segments with trans zig-zag or loose helical structures via a conformational defect. In
other words, the full width at half maximum of the backbone of organopolysilane is the
sum of these segments possessing the various absorption maximums. The light
