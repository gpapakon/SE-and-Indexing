<DESCRIPTION>
 INHIBITORY FACTORField of the InventionThe present invention relates to factors that mediate mammalian cell cycle arrest and maintain mammalian cells in a viable state, the use of such factors, and to nucleic acid seguences encoding such factors. In particular the invention relates to these factors, to fragments and polypeptide analogs thereof and to DNA seguences encoding the same.Background of the InventionBoth growth factors (stimulators of cell cycling) and growth inhibitory factors (inhibitory factors of cell cycling) play an important role in cell-cell interactions and cell division. Despite the practical importance of growth inhibitory factors, very few have been isolated and purified and, in most cases, there is little evidence that the biologically active inhibitory factors previously isolated are residents of the cell surface or act by binding cell surface receptors. The existence of cell surface inhibitory factors would be consistent with the models of regulation of cell division as a result of cell-cell contact.Compared to the numerous growth factors that have been described, very few inhibitory factors of cell proliferation have been isolated and characterized. The major inhibitory factors described include: 1) the 25 kDa homodimer transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) that has mitogenic activity with a variety of fibroblasts and yet expresses a potent inhibitory activity with normal human epithelial prokeratinocytes cultured in serum-free medium (Roberts et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 82: 119-123, 1985; Coffey et al., Cancer Res. 48: 1596-1602, 1988) and the structurally-related protein isolated from 

African green monkey cells (BCS-1) conditioned medium (Tucker et al.. Science 226: 705-707, 1984); 2) a 12-14 kDa protein isolated from mammary tissue (Bohmer et al., Exp. Cell Res. 150; 466-476, 1984; Muller et al., J. Cell. Physiol. 138: 415-423, 1989) that has been identified in cell nuclei and shown to be structurally related to a fibroblast growth inhibitory factor isolated from mouse 3T3 cell medium (Voss et al., Exp. Cell Res. 138: 397-407, 1982; Bohmer et al, J. Cell. Biochem. 38: 199-204, 1988); 3) a 17 kDa acidic protein, originally described as a glial maturation factor β, that has been shown to have antiprpliferative activity ( im, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86: 3901-3905, 1989; Lim et al., Cell Regulat. 1: 741-746, 1990); 4) an oligosaccharide from human diploid fibroblasts (Wieser et al., J. Cell Biol. Ill: 2681-2692, 1990); 5) a tissue-specific growth inhibitory
