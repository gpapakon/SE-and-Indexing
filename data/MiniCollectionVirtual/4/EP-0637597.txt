<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid compositions essentially 
consisting of compounds containing allylester groups, which can be 
crosslinked into articles of high refractive index. More particularly, the invention relates to radically 
polymerizable liquid compositions essentially consisting of 
compounds containing allylester groups and the articles of high 
refractive index obtained by crosslinking said compositions. The invention further relates to a process for preparing the 
constituent allylesters of said liquid compositions. High refractive index resins prepared by polymerizing 
di(meth)allylesters of arylcarboxylic acids are known in the state 
of the art. Published Japanese patent application JP 61144601 claims resins 
prepared by homopolymerization of dimethallyl phthalate, which 
however can be easily scratched and have a refractive index not 
greater than 1.56. Published Japanese patent application JP 03134005 and European 
patent EP 209124 claim resins prepared by polymerizing compounds 
having the following structures:  Although these resins have a high refractive index, they present 
coloration problems and less than optimum mechanical 
characteristics. Published Japanese patent applications JP 59191708, JP 6061212, JP 
61127713, JP 61183306 and European patent EP 154136 claim resins 
based on diallyl phthalate or dimethallyl phthalate mixed with 
derivatives of (meth)acrylic type. However these resins have a 
refractive index not greater than 1.56 and sometimes have mediocre 
mechanical characteristics. Other resins based on diallyl phthalate oligomers mixed with 
diethyleneglycol bis allyl carbonate, known by the name of CR 39 
of PPG Industries Inc. or RAV 7 of Enichem Synthesis, are claimed 
in Japanese patent applications JP 0354213 and JP 03199218, but 
these resins also have a maximum refractive index of 1.56 and 
present coloration problems. The present applicant has now discovered new liquid compositions 
essentially consisting of compounds containing allylester groups, 
which are able to provide by crosslinkage articles having a high 
refractive index, nD²⁰, of between 1.57 and 1.60 and to overcome 
the drawbacks of the known art.  Consequently the present invention provides radically 
polymerizable liquid compositions consisting essentially of 
compounds containing allylester groups, comprising: 
A) a resin containing at least two allylester groups of general 
formula (I): 
 
where: 
R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl; Z represents a C₂-C₃₃ organic radical of alkyl,
