<ABSTRACT>
The anodic dissolution of minerals in cells 
equipped with ion-exchange membranes is carried out at 

a potential that allows for the dissolution and/or 
regeneration of the metal salts present in the anolyte 

and simultaneously the electrodeposition of the metals 
in the catholyte. The process offers a lower-cost 

alternative to traditional processes, avoids negative 
environmental impact and allows for the recovery of 

economically valuable by-products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the electrochemical 
refining of metals, and more especially to an 
electrochemical process that is economically viable 
and environmentally acceptable. Traditional processes for obtaining metals are 
based on pyro-, hydro- and electrometallurgical 
techniques. Although there have been enormous 
technological advances in these processes, such 
advances have not solved the main problems of the 
metal refining industry, that is to say the high 
operating costs, high capital investment costs, the 
polluting nature of the processes and the decreasing 
quality of ore deposits. The future economic health of the industry is 
therefore likely to be closely connected to the 
following factors: 
relative size of investments; operating costs; ability to comply with environmental standards; final quality of the refined metal. The main cause for the high cost of these 
refining processes is the need for continuous 
replacement of the inventory of leaching agents, the 
high energy use and the requirement for additional  
 
investment to treat effluents. This invention seeks to address the abovementioned 
problems by using electrochemical cells 
provided with ion-exchange membranes and relying upon 
potentials which allow for the configuration of a 
cyclic process in terms of reagent inventory, thus 
reducing operating costs for energy consumption, 
manpower and membrane replacement. It is based upon 
the appreciation that the differences of potential 
applied in anodic polarisation may be such that they 
permit the dissolution of minerals and/or 
concentrates, and/or the regeneration of the leaching 
reagent, and takes advantage of these properties to 
achieve low energy consumption during dissolution and 
electrowinning and to recycle the leaching reagents. In accordance with the present invention, there 
is now provided a process for the electrochemical 
dissolution of a sulfur-containing and/or concentrated 
ore containing at least one metal to be recovered, in 
at least one electrolytic cell provided with an ion-exchange 
membrane and with anodic and cathodic 
compartments across which a potential difference is 
applied, the process comprising the steps of: 
(a) dissolving the ore in a leaching electrolyte 
and recovering the metal by electrodeposition; (b) effecting anodic dissolution of a sulfur-containing  
 
and/or concentrated ore and recovering the 
metal in the same or in another electrolytic cell with 
a difference of controlled potential; and (c) regenerating the leaching

A process for the electrochemical 
dissolution of a sulfur-containing and/or concentrated 

ore containing at least one metal to be recovered, in 
at least one electrolytic cell provided with an ion-exchange

applied, the process comprising the steps of: 

(a) dissolving the ore in a leaching electrolyte

(b) effecting anodic dissolution of a sulfur-containing 
and/or concentrated ore in an electrolytic 

cell with a difference of controlled potential; and 
(c) regenerating the leaching electrolyte in the 
anodic compartment of the cell or at least one other 

cell, and recycling the regenerated leaching 
electrolyte so that its quantity remains substantially 

constant. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the 
potential difference applied to the cell is selected 

to achieve anodic dissolution of the ore fed into the 
anodic compartment of the cell and to oxidise the 

leaching electrolyte that is reduced in situ.

wherein the leaching electrolyte has a physicochemical 

composition that remains substantially constant. 
A process according to claim 3, wherein the 
composition of the leaching electrolyte is selected to

electrode reduction potential of the leaching 

electrolyte is greater than or equal to the standard 
electrode potential of the ore to be dissociated. 
A process according to any one of claims 1

to 5, wherein the metal ore is dissociated in a 

leaching pool, feeding the cathodic compartment of the 
cell, the metal being recovered and leaching 

electrolyte regenerated in the anodic compartment of

electrodeposition cell or the soluble anode of the 
electrodeposition cell and the soluble cathode of the 

regeneration cell together forming a single entity.
