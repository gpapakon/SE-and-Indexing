<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a linearized transmission system according to the
preamble of claim 1.Such a linearized transmission system can be used for yielding a net linear
output from an amplitude modulated transmission device which is inherent
nonlinear, such an optical source comprising a CW laser and an external
modulator. The linearization of a given nonlinear optical transmitter is achieved by
passing the electrical input to the transmitter through an additional electronic
nonlinear device, "the linearizer", the output of which is then routed to the optical
source.The problem of analog transmission via fiber optics,
especially for Cable Television (CATV) transmission and
distribution, has received strong impetus with the
introduction of some AM fiber links based on novel distrusted
feedback (DFB) semiconductor lasers. Analog AM transmission
systems and distribution networks benefit from fiber-optic
transport, since the distance between electrical repeaters can
be significantly increased as compared with electronic
distribution networks. However, the requirements on second-order
and third-order linearity are very stringent for
directly modulated lasers to be used in the optical
transmitters, since the presence of non-linearities causes
intermodulation distortion which, in the case of CATV
transmission for example, shows up as intolerable degradation
of the television picture. Because of non-linearity of the
optical source, the modulating signal amplitude has to be
limited to small values in order to maintain the composite
triple beat and second order distortion specifications under
a tolerable level. A reduction of the optical source non-linearity
would directly translate into the ability to
increase the modulation signal amplitude while still
maintaining the composite distortion specifications. An 
linearity would directly translate into the ability to
increase the modulation signal amplitude while still
maintaining the composite distortion specifications. An
increased modulation amplitude (modulation index) is
equivalent to better signal to noise ratio, i.e., the ability
to distribute the analog signal over larger distances, to
split the signal to more receiving sites, or to transmit more
channels on the same link. The main obstacle with AM fiber
transmission is how to overcome the non-linearity limitations
of optical sources for analog transmission. Currently used
approaches include:
1. Careful laser device selection, using
distributed feedback lasers and other types of semiconductor
low-noise
