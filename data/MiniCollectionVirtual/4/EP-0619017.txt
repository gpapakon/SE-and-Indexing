 VIDEO FLUORESCENCE MONITOR FOR DETERMINATION OF PCB OR PCB MINERAL OIL SPILL OUTLINEField of the InventionThis invention relates to a video fluorescent monitor. More specifically, it relates to an apparatus and method for real-time on-site video imaging for the detection of the presence and boundaries of a spill of material of fluorescent type on surfaces. PCB, PCB- contaminated mineral oil-based fluorescing mixtures, and mineral oil-based insulating liquids are specifically included.Background of the Invention Spills of insulating liquids for transformers and capacitors on many surfaces often cannot be seen readily by the eye. The presence and boundaries of a spill have typically been determined by applying costly and time-consuming statistical sampling procedures. Furthermore, more sampling is required for cleanup completeness inspections.For spill clean-up efforts, sophisticated laboratory equipment is either brought to the spill site for sampling or the samples are sent to a central laboratory. In the first case, use of the portable gas chromatograph requires special operator training. In the second case, the sample's trip to the laboratory takes time. Often the spill is required to be cleaned up before any analytical results can be returned from the lab, resulting in costly clean-up or missed spots. The clean-up of spills of insulating liquids for transformers and capacitors would be better accomplished through a system which provides the ability to easily and concisely map the boundaries of a spill occurring on surfaces such as asphalt, concrete, grass and dirt and wet surfaces. Moreover, a system providing a real-time picture monitor of cleanup efforts could facilitate useful information gathering. Furthermore, a system which does not require time consuming sampling procedures during clean-up completeness inspections could provide for more efficient and thorough spill cleanup operations. Therefore, there is a need for a real-time, user friendly system for distinguishing the spill from the non-spill area. 

 Accordingly, in an attempt to achieve the above objects, a real-time monitor system has been developed which provides an operator the ability to see fluorescent emissions of a spill in order to map out its boundaries. An excitation source lamp is used to induce fluorescent emissions by the insulating liquids. The boundaries of the spill are mapped by placement of markers according to detected emissions made visible to a viewer on a video display monitor. The system operates so that a first
