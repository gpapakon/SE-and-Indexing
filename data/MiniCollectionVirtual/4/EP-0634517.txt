<CLAIMS>
A process for dyeing fur skins with oxidation dyes 
following a pretreatment, which comprises pretreating 

the fur skins with a metal mordant that contains 
glyoxylic acid. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the metal mordant 
used is an iron mordant, chromium mordant, copper 

mordant, copper-iron mordant, chromium-copper 
mordant, iron-chrome alum mordant or copper-chrome 

alum mordant. 
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the metal salts 
used in the chromium mordant are potassium and/or 

sodium dichromate. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
metal mordant contains 0.1 to 7 g of metal salt, 

based on one liter of mordanting liquor. 
The process of claim 3, wherein the chromium mordant 
contains 0.1 to 7 g of dichromate, based on one 

liter of mordanting liquor. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the 
metal mordant contains a degreasing agent, preferably 

a fatty alcohol polyglycol ether. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the 
pH of the metal mordant lies within the range  

 
between 3 and 5. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the 
metal mordant contains 1 to 7 g of glyoxylic acid, 

based on one liter of mordanting liquor. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the 
glyoxylic acid is added to the mordanting liquor in 

the form of an aqueous solution, preferably 40 - 50% 
strength by weight. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the 
mordant, as well as glyoxylic acid, contains further 

acids, preferably formic acid, acetic acid and/or 
glycolic acid. 
The process of claim 10, wherein the ratio of 
glyoxylic acid to further acids is 9:1. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein 

the pretreatment is carried out at a temperature 
from 20 to 40Â°C and over a duration from 3 to 

24 hours. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 12, further 
comprising hydroextracting the fur skins after the 

mordanting, if desired rinsing them beforehand with 
water and then introducing them into the dyebath.
