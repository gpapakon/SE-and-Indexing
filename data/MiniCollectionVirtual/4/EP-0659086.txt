<CLAIMS>
A vaccine strain of a pathogenic bacteria
comprising at least one mutation selected from the

group consisting of a pyrimidine pathway mutation, an
iron metabolism mutation and a colicin transport

mutation, said mutation providing attenuation of the
virulence of said bacteria.
A method of preparing a vaccine strain of a
pathogenic bacteria comprising:


(a) producing at least one mutation selected
from the group consisting of a pyrimidine pathway

mutation, an iron metabolism mutation, and a colicin
transport mutation, in a virulent strain of said

pathogenic bacteria to provide an attenuated organism;
(b) isolating the attenuated organism which
contains said at least one mutation; and
(c) using said isolated organism as a
vaccine strain.
The method of claim 2 comprising selecting an
attenuating mutation associated with a marker gene.
The method of claim 3 wherein said marker gene
is an antibiotic resistance gene.

vaccine strain of a pathogenic bacteria having at least

one attenuating mutation selected from the group
consisting of a pyrimidine pathway mutation, an iron

metabolism mutation, and a colicin transport mutation.
Pharmaceutical composition comprising an
effective amount of at least one vaccine strain of a

pathogenic bacteria wherein said vaccine strain comprises at
least one mutation selected from the group consisting of a

pyrimidine pathway mutation, an iron metabolism mutation and
a colicin transport mutation, and optionally a

pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.
Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 7
for preventing a bacterial disease in an animal.

comprising at least two of said mutations.
The embodiment of any of claims 1 to 14 wherein
said strain has a reversion frequency less than about 10
-7
.
The embodiment of any of claims 1 to 15 wherein
said pathogenic bacteria comprises an extracellular

pathogenic bacteria.
The embodiment of any of claims 1 to 16 wherein
said pathogenic bacteria comprises 
E. coli
.
The embodiment of claim 17 wherein said 
E. coli

is serotype 01, 02 or 078.
The embodiment of claim 18 wherein said
vaccine strain is selected from the group consisting of

serotype 01[carAB], serotype 02[carAB]
 serotype
078[carAB]
, serotype 01[fur], serotype 02[fur]
,
