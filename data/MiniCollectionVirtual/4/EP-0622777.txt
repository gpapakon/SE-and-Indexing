<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (1) for attenuating the energy of the acoustic waves emitted by a sound source (2) in at least one predetermined direction (D), which sound waves are emitted in at least one zone of the sound source (2). It is characterised in that it essentially comprises:   - at least one means (18, 19), the function of which is, on the one hand, to select and to sense at least two sound waves generated in predetermined zones of the sound source (2) and, on the other hand, to guide these waves, separately, towards, - at least one means (20), the function of which is to place these waves substantially in phase opposition and to cause them to interfere at a predetermined point in the device (1).
