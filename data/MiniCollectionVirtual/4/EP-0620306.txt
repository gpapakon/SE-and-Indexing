<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for continuous steaming and 
dimensional stabilization of continuous fabric webs 

comprises a steaming tunnel (11) through which a 
conveyor belt (12) runs, which supports and conveys a 

continuous fabric to be treated (13), the steaming 
tunnel (11) being provided with an inlet opening (14), 

an outlet opening (15) and a steam delivering device 
(16), in which apparatus the inlet opening (14) and the 

outlet opening (15) are both arranged under the bottom 
tunnel portion and inside said tunnel, opposite to at 

least one of said openings a temperature sensor (23) is 
provided which modulates the emission of steam from the 

steam delivering device (16). Furthermore, a method is 
accomplished for the steaming and dimensional 

stabilization of continuous fabric webs, method which 
is constituted by the treatment of fabric webs in an 

air-free atmosphere of saturated steam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
continuous steaming and dimensional stabilization of
fabrics in the form of continuous webs, and to a method
using said apparatus.At present, apparatuses are known and used for
continuously performing the steaming, the relaxation,
the shrinkage and the dimensional stabilization of fabrics
in general. Under the generic term "fabrics", both
fabrics of weft-warp type and knitted fabrics, as well as
even non-woven fabric made from any materials of natural,
man-made and synthetic origin, are to be understood.The apparatuses known from tne prior art have the
purpose of determining a stabilization of the fabrics without
applying any cross and/or longitudinal (i.e., in the
machine direction) stresses to the material under treatment.These apparatuses essentially are constituted by a
conveyor belt and a tunnel inside which the fabric is
caused to run through. The conveyor belt is arranged
as a closed ring and has a partially open surface structure,
such as constituted by a net, so as to be permeable
after receiving the fabric to be treated.The tunnel is assimilable to a steaming tank through
which the fabric supporting conveyor belt runs. Under
said conveyor belt, a steam delivering device, and over
it a roof, or, anyway, a heated condensation preventing
cover connected with a sucking hood with a vent fan are
respectively provided. Said vent fan also intakes the
steam which leaves the tunnel through the inlet and outlet
openings of the latter, through which the conveyor
belt and the fabric web run, together with a certain air
amount from the working premises.Although they effectively treat the fabric and supply
it with optimal, natural, stress-free relaxation and shrinkage
effects, such a kind at apparatuses known from the
prior art unfortunately display the following drawbacks.High steam consumption, because the tunnel must
be constantly kept filled with steam and in the mean time
there is a continuous escape of steam from said tunnel
inlet and outlet openings. In fact, the steam excess is
continuously sucked, together with a certain air amount
from the working premises, by the sucking hood which
is installed over the tunnel and is provided with a vent
fan.Continuous steam and air venting to the surrounding
atmosphere, with considerably high energy consumption
and waste for the treatment and the heating
of steam and air from the working premises.Treatment of fabric inside the tunnel with a mixed
atmosphere of air and steam, with the treatment temperature
being

Apparatus for continuous steaming and dimensional
stabilization of continuous fabric webs comprising

a steaming tunnel (11) through which a conveyor
belt (12) runs, which supports and conveys a continuous

fabric web (13) to be treated, said steaming
tunnel (11) being provided with an inlet opening

(14), an outlet opening (15) and a steam delivering
device (16), whereby said inlet opening (14) and

said outlet opening (15) are both arranged under
the lower portion of the tunnel, characterised in that

inside said tunnel, positioned at at least one of said
openings, a temperature sensor (23) is provided

which modulates the emission of steam from the
steam delivering device (16), and in that, positioned

at an upper covering portion and/or to a lower portion
of said steaming tunnel (11), upper (20) and lower

(21) heated plates, are installed.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that said inlet (14) and outlet (15) openings are both

directed downwards.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that a motor-driven roller (18) is provided inside said

steaming tunnel (11) in its upper portion positioned
at an initial portion of said conveyor belt (12).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in
that said downstream from said motor-driven roller

(18) there is installed a fabric web deflection control
device (19) which checks the feed of fabric web (13)

in said initial portion, or region of deposition of the
fabric web on said conveyor belt (12).
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in
that said fabric web deflection control device (19)

comprises an optical-fibre reading unit (24) installed
on a support plate (25), which detects the distance

of said fabric web (13) from said support plate (25)
and regulates the revolution speed of said motor-driven

roller (18).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that inside the interior of said steaming tunnel (11)

a temperature sensor (26) is installed which regulates
said upper (20) and lower (21) heated plates.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that on a bottom portion of said steaming tunnel (11)

also a vibrator device (22) is installed, acting on said
conveyor belt (12), from the lower side thereof. 
Method for steaming and dimensionally stabilizing continuous
fabric webs, the method comprising the steps of:


i) conveying and supporting the continuous fabric webs on a
conveyor belt running through a steaming tunnel from an

inlet opening to an outlet opening of the tunnel, the
inlet and outlet openings being both arranged under a

lower portion of the tunnel,
ii) delivering steam into the steaming tunnel from a steam
delivering device connected thereto, to generate a

saturated steam atmosphere in the tunnel to treat the
continuous fabric webs,
iii) modulating the emission of steam from the steam
delivering device by means of a temperature sensor

positioned inside the tunnel at at least one of the
inlet opening and outlet opening, and
iv) heating an upper covering portion and/or a lower portion
of the steaming tunnel and the saturated steam

atmosphere therein by means of upper and/or lower heated
plates installed at the upper covering portion and/or

the lower portion, respectively, wherein the treatment
of the continuous fabric webs is carried out in a steam

atmosphere which is free from air and constituted by
overheated saturated steam at a temperature comprised within the

range of from 100 to 120Â°C.
