<ABSTRACT>
The manual dispensing device (41) for a double cartridge for two-component masses is equipped with in each case a double push rod (44) and an advancing drive acting jointly on the push-rod and actuable via a trigger lever (43), the advancing drive including an advancing member (7) which via a toothing (18) on the push rod acts on the latter. The advancing member (7) includes a spring-loaded driver (38) which has a plurality of teeth (17), engages substantially vertically in the toothing (18) on the push rod (44) and acts substantially only in the direction of the push rod or dispensing direction. Such a dispensing device can be produced from a small number of inexpensive parts made of plastic and, by the use of a plurality of teeth, enables a substantial reduction in the applied pressure and rapid regripping of the trigger lever with a short dead travel.

A manually operated dispensing device for a double
dispensing cartridge for two-component products, comprising

a double thrust ram (4, 44) and an advance drive jointly
acting on the double thrust ram and being actuated by a

trigger lever (3), whereby the advance drive comprises a
thrust member (7) which acts on the double thrust ram (4,

44) via a toothing (18) of the latter, characterised in that
the teeth of the toothing (18) on the double thrust ram (4,

44) are directed towards the free end of the handle (2) of
the device and in that the thrust member (7) comprises a

driving dog (16, 23, 38) under the action of a spring and
having several teeth (17, 24) and acting on the toothing

(18) present on the double thrust ram (4, 44) in a sense
substantially perpendicular to the direction of dispensing

and in that the thrust member substantially acts only in the
direction of the double thrust ram, resp. the direction of

dispensing.
A dispensing device according to claim 1, characterised
in that the driving dog (16, 38) is formed as hollow body or

comprises a cavity (39) in which a pressure spring (19, 40)
is located and connected to a lever (20, 42) traversing the

housing (5, 45).
A dispensing device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the trigger lever (43) is articulated

to the thrust member (7) by means of a arc-compensating
element (36) which is guided substantially parallel to the

double thrust ram (44).
A dispensing device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the trigger lever (3, 33) is

articulated to the thrust member (7) by means of a bolt (6)
and co-operates with at least one arc compensating element 

(14, 35) which is slidingly guided substantially
perpendicular to the double thrust ram (4)
A dispensing device according to claim 3, characterised
in that the arc compensating element is formed as a joint

bar (36) which at one end is articulated to the thrust
member (7) by means of an axle (13) and guided linearly and

which on its other end is connected by a bolt (6) to the
trigger lever (43) in such a way that there it follows its

arc-like movement.
A dispensing device according to claim 4, characterised
in that the arc compensating element comprises two sliding

blocks (14) which are articulated to the trigger lever (3)
by an axle (13) and are slidingly guided within compartments

15) in the housing (5).
A dispensing device according to claim 4, characterised
in that the rotational axis of the trigger lever (33) is a

semicircular body (35) serving as arc compensating element
and embracing a corresponding recess (34) in the trigger

lever (33).
A dispensing device according to one of the claims 1 to
7, 
characterised in that two pullback springs (21, 22)
supported on the housing (5) act unto the thrust member (7).
A dispensing device according to one of the claims 1 to
8, characterised in that the housing (5, 45) with the handle

(2) and the cover (12, 47), the double thrust ram (4, 44),
the driving dog (16, 23, 38) and the thrust member (7) as

well as the trigger lever (3, 33, 43) are made from
synthetic material.
A dispensing device according to one of the claims 1 to
9, characterised in that all pieces (3, 33, 43; 4, 44; 16, 

23, 38; 14, 35, 36) necessary for the actuating mechanism
are lodged in the lower part (5, 45) of the housing and held

by a secured cover (12, 47).
A dispensing device according to one of the claims 1 to
10, characterised in that it comprises a friction brake (26)

acting upon the double thrust ram (4, 44).
