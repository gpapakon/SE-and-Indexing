<ABSTRACT>
The fuel cell battery (10) has modules (1) arranged like a stack and its reactants are air and gaseous fuel. It is constructed in an essentially centrally symmetric fashion. A module comprises the following components: a three-layered electrochemically active plate (2), which is free from perforations and consists of a solid electrolyte (20), which conducts oxide ions, and a gas electrode (21) and an air electrode (22); and a metallic heat exchanger element (5), in the form of a disc, for heating the reactants. According to the invention, a porous layer (3) produces a connection between the gas electrode (21) and the heat exchanger element (5) which connection is electrically conductive and has a compensating action with regard to thermal stresses; furthermore, this layer (3) forms, together with the electrochemically active plate (2), a cohesive unit.

Fuel cell battery (10) comprising modules (1) in 
stacked arrangement and using air and gaseous fuel as 

reactants, wherein every module is substantially centrally 
symmetric and comprises the following components, 


a three-layer electrochemically active plate (2) with no 
openings which comprises a solid electrolyte (20) 

conducting oxide ions as well as a gas and an air electrode 
(21 and 22), 
and a plate-shaped, metallic heat exchange element (5) for 
heating the reactants, 
 
characterised in that a connection between the gas 

electrode (21) and the heat exchange element (5) is made by 
a porous layer (3) which is elec
trically conductive and 
acts to equalise thermal stresses, that the surface pores 

of this layer (3) on the side of the gas electrode (21) are 
filled with metallic particles (33), that the porous layer 

(3) forms together with the electrochemically active plate 
(2) an integrated unit, and that the three layers (21, 20, 

22) of the electrochemically active plate (2) are produced 
by a vacuum plasma spray process. 
Fuel cell battery according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the porous layer (3) is of a metal 

felt. 
Fuel cell battery according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the porous layer (3) comprises a 

coarse-meshed, undulated wire cloth (30) and a fine-meshed, 
planar wire cloth (31), the fine-meshed wire cloth being 

arranged on the side of the gas electrode (21) and 
impregnated with metallic particles. 
Fuel cell battery according to one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that structural elements (41) are 

firmly connected to the surface of the air electrode (22),  
 

the structural elements being provided for the collection 
of current and electric conducting to an adjacent module. 
Arrangement (100) including at least two fuel 
cell batteries (10) according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

comprising a common housing (80, 90) and a common reforming 
device (9). 
Arrangement according to claim 5 including about 
100 modules (1) per fuel cell battery (10) and the 

electrochemically active plate (2) has a diameter of about 
30 cm to produce electric output of about 50 kW.
