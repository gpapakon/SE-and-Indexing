<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning solvent composition comprising an aliphatic fluorohydrocarbon represented by the general formula 
C
n
F
m
H
2n+2-m
 (wherein n and m represent each a positive integer provided that 4 ≦ n ≦ 6 and 2n-3 ≦ m 
<
 2n+2) or a mixture 
thereof with a C₁-C₄ alcohol and, further added thereto, a lactam and/or a carboxamide, a tertiary amine or an alcohol 

having an ether linkage and/or an amino linkage in its molecule. A cleaning method comprising removing dirty components 
by dipping in the above composition, conducting rinsing with the above mixture and thereafter, if necessary, conducting 

steam cleaning with the mixture. It is possible to obtain a cleaned article free from stain and dirt in a simplified drying 
step, because rinsing and steam cleaning can be conducted in a nonaqueous system with a cleaning solvent composition 

which does not destruct ozone, is nonflammable and has a potent detergency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cleaning solvent
composition and a cleaning process in which flux, oil,
mold-releasing agents, printing ink and the like adhered
to an object are removed therefrom to clean the object using
the said cleaning solvent composition.In the prior art, flon 113, a chlorofluoroethane
compound, has several advantages including (a)non-combustibility,
(b)low biotoxicity and (c)highly selective
solubility (able to dissolve fat and oil, grease and wax
etc. without damaging plastics, rubber and other high
molecular materials), and it has been widely used either
by itself, in a mixture with other organic solvents, or in
the form of azeotropic compositions as a solvent or
cleaning agent. However, it has been feared that flon 113
may destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere and
thereby cause serious adverse effects on the earth's 
ecosystem including the environment for humans. According to an international
agreement it has been concluded to limit the use and production of
flon which threatens the ozone layer with destruction. Accordingly, people
very much want the development of a solvent or cleaning agent that uses
flon substitutes.Japanese Patent Publication Gazette No. 21000/83 discloses a cleaning composition
that contains at least 50% by weight of N-methyl-2pyrrolidone and at
least 10% by weight of alkanol amine that can mix with water. Lines 27 to 35
of the sixth column of the cited reference mention that the cleaning composition
can be used with a hydrocarbon solvent consisting of Freon such as
fluorohydrocarbon and tetrafluoroethane up to about 35%. This composition,
however, requires a rinsing process using water (for removal of composition
adhered to the surface of the cleaned object) to be followed by a complicated
drying process.EP-A-0 431 458 discloses a cleaning composition containing as an active
component an aliphtic fluorohydrocarbon represented by the formula
CnFmH2n+2-m, wherein 4 ≤ n ≤ 6 and 6 ≤ m ≤ 12.JP-A-1-139 540 relates to a method of stabilizing azeotropic compositions,
wherein at least one compound selected from the group consisting of
nitro compounds, phenols, amines, ethers, amylenes, esters, organic phosphites,
epoxides, furans, alcohols, ketones and triazols is added to an azeotropic
composition consisting of 1,1,2-trifluoroethane and one selected
from octafluorocyclobutane, 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane, dichloromonofluoromethane,
trichloromonofluoromethane, 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane
or 1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane.The object of the present invention

m
H
2n+2-m

(wherein, n and m are positive integral numbers, being 4 ≤ n ≤ 6, 2n - 3 ≤ m ≤
2n + 2, respectively), characterized in that said composition is made by either

blending said aliphatic fluorohydrocarbon or blending a mixture of
said aliphatic fluorohydrocarbon and an alcohol having a carbon number

of 1 to 4 with at least one selected from the group comprising lactam
and/or carboxylic acid amide, tertiary amines, and alcohol having ether

linkage and/or amino linkage within its molecules.
The cleaning solvent composition as defined in claim 1, wherein said
aliphatic fluorohydrocarbon or said mixture is blended with at least one

selected from the group comprising lactam and/or carboxylic acid amide,
tertiary amines, and alcohols having ether linkage and/or amino linkage

within its molecules, at a blending proportion of 10 to 95% by weight.
A cleaning process wherein an object to be cleaned is dipped into the
cleaning solvent composition as defined in claim 1 or 2 to remove dirty

component, and thereafter the object is rinsed with a rinsing agent composition
which comprises a mixture of said aliphatic fluorohydrocarbon and

alcohol having a carbon number of 1 to 4.
The cleaning process as defined in claim 3, wherein said object, after

being rinsed as above-mentioned, is steam cleaned with a composition
comprising a mixture of said aliphatic fluorohydrocarbon and said alcohol

having a carbon number of 1 to 4.
The cleaning process as defined in claim 3 or 4, wherein said composition
comprising said mixture which is used for the above-mentioned rinsing

and steam cleaning processes is an azeotropic or an azeotrope-like
composition.
