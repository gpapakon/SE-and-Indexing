<ABSTRACT>
The power resistor includes an internal structure with a flat, thin resistive element. The element rests on a flat dielectric barrier on a heat sink. An isolated electronic box surrounds the structure, except where it contacts the dielectric barrier. The box has two external connections, each connected to an electrical resistance by a link inside the box. The links are part of the box's internal structure. A calibration voltage is applied to each resistive element and the dielectric barrier. The applied voltage applier creates a stable charge to the internal structure for calibration.
