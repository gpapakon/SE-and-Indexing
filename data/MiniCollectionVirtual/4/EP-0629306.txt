<CLAIMS>
An organization and/or planning tool, comprising a 
series of cards and at least one support (2) adapted to 

temporarily receive said cards in a specific and modifiable 
classification order, said cards consisting of paper 

stickers, called "transferable" stickers (1a, 1b, 1c), having 
an inscribable face and a face which is partially coated with 

a pressure-sensitive adhesive permitting repeated sticking, 
unsticking and resticking operations, the inscribable face of 

said transferable stickers offering an identification/classification 
zone (I) and an annotation zone (A) and 

the support having zones for receiving (3a, 3b, 3c) the 
stickers, with a partial overlap between them leaving their 

identification/classification zone (I) uncovered, wherein 
each sticker (1a, 1b, 1c) has a continuous or discontinuous 

cut-out or indentation (4a, 7a ; 4b, 7b ; 4c, 7c) forming a 
window(s), affecting at least one edge of its 

identification/classification (I) and annotation (A) zones, 
and wherein the support (2) has at least one column of 

information (5, 6) which can be seen through said window or 
windows when said stickers are received on said support. 
The tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cut-out 
of each sticker determines a primary window (4a, 4b, 4c) in 

the identification/classification zone (I) and a secondary 
window (7a, 7b, 7c) in the annotation zone (A), said primary 

window being adapted to align with the secondary window of 
one or more other stickers when the latter are in place on 

the support (2) with partial overlap between them. 
The tool as claimed in claim 2, wherein the depth of 
the secondary window (7a, 7b, 7c) is at least equal to that 

of the primary window (4a, 4b, 4c). 
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the support (2) has several parallel and juxtaposed 

columns of information (5, 6).  
 
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the information of the or of one column of 

information (5, 6) consists of a coded colour. 
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the information of the or of one column of 

information (5, 6) consists of a succession of signs, such as 
figures, letters, etc. 
The tool as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6, 
wherein the secondary window (7a, 7b, 7c) has a depth (2p) 

which is at least equal to the cumulative width of said 
columns (5, 6).
