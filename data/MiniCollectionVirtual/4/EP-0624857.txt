<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a passive type moving
object detection system, and more particularly to a moving object
detection system for detecting any change in the energy level from the
detection region in accordance with the intrusion, wherein the "passive
type" is a type which does not use a source of radiant energy but
utilizes the radiation of infrared generated by the intruder. Herein,
the moving object includes not only intruders but also visiting guests.Passive type detection systems are known and widely used. The
passive type system is based on a phenomenon that a living thing
radiates infrared having an intensity according to the body temperature.The known system is constructed to focus infrared radiating from a
human passing through a predetermined detection region, and transmits a
focused ray to an infrared detecting element whereby a change in the
level of infrared energy from the detection region is converted into
voltage so as to output a signal. If the signal is found to exceed a
reference value, any form of alarm is given. Such detection systems
are used not only as intrusion detection systems but also as switches at
automatic doors to know in advance that a visiting guest has arrived.A problem of the known detection system is that it is likely to
produce an alarm owing to a sudden rise in the ambient temperature
around the detection region caused by strong wind, microwave noise, 
sunlight, or any other interference. In order to prevent the
production of false signal, an error preventive device is provided,
which will be described by reference to Figure 12:A detector 1 is provided with a pair of infrared sensors 1a and
1b (three or more sensors can be used) which are arranged in parallel or
in series with opposite polarity. An optical system 2 is located and
detection regions E1 and E2 having a human height are set up.When a human H or a dog M passes through the detection regions
E1 and E2, it cannot instantly pass through the two regions. A time
interval from the region E1 to the region E2 is unavoidable. This is a
different point from ambient interference such as sunlight which covers
the two regions E1 and E2 simultaneously. The outputs from the regions
E1 and E2 due to ambient interference are mutually negated because of
the differential electrical connection, thereby avoiding the production
of false alarm. When a human intruder H passes through the detection
regions E1 and E2, the human covers the whole space of each detection
region E1 and E2, thereby outputting a
