<ABSTRACT>
A retrofit bezel assembly to be installed within an interior of an 
aircraft, the aircraft 

having overhead stowage bins (34) with shelves (28). The bezel assembly 
is constructed as a unit 

for installation in place of an existing bezel assembly. Each bezel 
assembly unit includes a 

ceiling panel (12), four bulkhead extensions (36), and two shelf 
extensions (26). The ceiling panel 

substantially spans and covers the upper surface of the interior of the 
aircraft from a 

right-side stowage bin to a left-side stowage bin. The bulkhead 
extensions are attached to 

the corners of the ceiling panel. They extend downwardly adjacent the 
interior ends of the 

sides of the stowage bins. The bulkhead extensions are configured to 
attach to inside ends 

of the bin shelves with fasteners through existing holes. Bin doors (16) 
are attached to the 

bulkhead extensions. The door contour cross section matches the shape 
of the interior 

sides of the bulkhead extensions. Each of the shelf extensions is 
attached between two 

bulkhead extensions to be fastened to an interior end of a bin shelf. 
The shelf extensions extend the width of the bin shelves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a retrofit bezel assembly for replacing at least a portion
of an original bezel assembly of the interior of an aircraft and to a method of
updating an aircraft interior with a retrofit bezel asssembly.Newer commercial aircraft have interiors that are more modern, convenient, safe,
and aesthetically pleasing than their older counterparts. For example, the
overhead interior components of the newer aircraft have several advantages
over the older interiors. The new stowage bins are larger to handle a larger
volume of carry-on luggage. The new bin shelves are long and wide enough to fit
a standard garment bag. The bins are also safer since the door has a more
vertical orientation so that shifted baggage will not likely fall out upon opening the
bin door. The entire overhead interior has a more modern look as well. For
example, the ceiling panels provide a smooth uninterrupted ceiling to negate the
"tunnel" appearance and create a wider looking passenger cabin.Because of the expense of new planes, an airline cannot simply trade in its old
models for new updated planes. However, the airline may not want to be left with
the old looks, inconveniences, maintenance, and safety problems. Beyond real
problems due to safety, an airline with outdated interiors may not instill
confidence in its customers if they feel they are riding in a dilapidated airplane.
Maintenance is also a problem for the airlines as the older aircraft require more
work to keep them in good condition. In the past, the airlines have retrofit certain
parts in an attempt to overcome these types of problems, at least to an extent.Various portions of aircraft interiors have been replaced or retrofitted with new
portions or improved parts. Examples of past interior retrofitting include old
carpeting replaced with new and updated carpeting, worn seat fabric replaced
with new seat coverings, the number and size of seats changed, changed seat
arrangements and changed spacing between seats. Modifications to interior
items above the seats has included replacing entire stowage bin assemblies.
Changes may be desired due to wear, availability of new materials, safety
concerns, or modern looks of newer planes. Consumer confidence may not be maintained if interiors are old, worn out,
outdated, or unsafe. However, modifications, even if only cosmetic, can be costly.
An airline owning a large number of older aircraft may want their planes to look
more like the newer aircraft. An airline may also have safety concerns. Concerns
may also

<CLAIMS>
A retrofit bezel assembly for replacing at least a portion of an original bezel
assembly (40) of the interior of an aircraft having stowage bins (34) with shelves

(28), comprising:

a) at least one bin shelf extension (26) being configured for attachment to the end
of the existing bin shelf (28); and
b) at least one bulkhead extension (58) attached to the bin shelf extension (26);

wherein said bin shelf extension (26), when attached to the front of the existing bin
shelf (28) forms a continuation of the existing bin shelf (28), thus extending the

depth of the existing bin shelf (28), and wherein the at least one bulkhead
extension (58) extends from a ceiling panel (12;70) downwardly along portions of

the front of the stowage bins (34) to the at least one bin shelf extension (26).
A retrofit bezel assembly according to claim 1, comprising two bulkhead
extensions (58), wherein one of the bulkhead extensions (58) is for attachment to

the bin shelf (28) of a left-side stowage bin (34) and the other bulkhead extension
(58) is for attachment to the bin shelf (28) of a right-side stowage bin (34), further

comprising a ceiling panel (12;70), which is attached to the upper ends of said
two bulkhead extensions (58), said ceiling panel (12,70) substantially spanning

the area between the right-side stowage bin (34) and the left-side stowage bin
(34) and substantially covering the upper surface of the interior of the airplane

from the right-side stowage bin (34) to the left-side stowage bin (34) when the
assembly (10) is mounted.
A retrofit bezel assembly according to claim 2, wherein the stowage bins (34)
include bulkheads (36), the retrofit bezel assembly (10) further comprising a

plurality of bin doors (16), each door (16) being attached to at least one of the
bulkhead extensions (58), wherein at least one of said bulkhead extensions (58) 

is coupled to a bin shelf (28) adjacent to one of the bulkheads (36) of the
stowage bins (34), said at least one of the bulkhead extensions (58) having a

shape substantially matching the shape of the space between the stowage bin
(34) bulkhead (36) and the bin door (16).
A retrofit bezel assembly according to claim 1, further comprising a bin door
(16) attached to the at least one bulkhead extension (58), said door (16) being

constructed and arranged to close with its bottom end disposed near an inner
edge of the bin shelf extension (26).
A retrofit bezel assembly according to any one of the preceeding claims,
further comprising a handrail (24) attached to the bin shelf extension (26).
A retrofit bezel assembly according to any one of the preceeding claims,
wherein at least one of the bulkhead extensions (58) and of the bin shelf

extensions (26) have attachment holes that match preexisting holes on the bin
shelves (28), such that the entire bezel assembly (10) can be secured in place by

fastening the assembly (10) to the aircraft at the preexisting holes.
A method of updating an aircraft interior with a retrofit bezel assembly (10),
each assembly (10) including a ceiling panel (12;70), bulkhead extensions (58),

bin doors (16), and shelf extensions (26), comprising the steps of:

a) removing an old bezel assembly (40) including a ceiling panel (48), stowage
bin doors (42), and bullnose assemblies (30), leaving old bins (34) and shelves

(28) in place;
b) positioning an entire retrofit bezel assembly (10) in place within the aircraft in
place of the old bezel assembly (40); and
c) fastening the assembly (10) in place.
A method according to claim 7, wherein the step of positioning is carried out

such that pre-existing holes in bin shelves (28) are aligned with attachment
locations on the retrofit bezel assembly (10).
A method according to claim 7 or 8, wherein the retrofit bezel assembly (10) is
