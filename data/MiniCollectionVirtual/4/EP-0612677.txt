<ABSTRACT>
Conveying system for plates 22 which are made of a metallic, magnetic or non-magnetic material, which is composed of a linear motor (stator) 9, 10, a first nozzle plate 14, 15 which is arranged on the active side of the linear motor 9, 10 and a second nozzle plate 16, 17 which is arranged so that its surface is parallel to that of the first one 14, 15 and is provided with a gap through which the plate 22 can pass. Cushions of air for positioning the plates 22 within the gap can be generated via the nozzles 18 of the nozzle plates 14, 15, 16, 17.

<CLAIMS>
A conveying system for metallic panels with one or more linear 
motors and means for the generation of air cushions which are 

used to set the distance between said panels and said linear 
motors, with a first nozzle plate (14, 15) being provided on 

the active side of every primary part with several windings of 
said linear motor (9, 10), 
characterised in the 
fact
 that in parallel to the surface of said first nozzle 
plate, a second nozzle plate (16, 17) out of non-metallic material 

with a gap for the throughput of said panels (22) is 
arranged and said first and said second nozzle plate (14, 15, 

16, 17) possess nozzles (18), whose outlets point into the direction 
of said gap and which are distributed over the surfaces 

of said nozzle plates, said nozzles being connectable to 
sources of compressed air via air connections in the interior 

of said nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17). 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that said nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17) are 
provided with adjustable brush strips at their longitudinal 

edges. 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that said nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17) are 
provided with adjustable rollers at their longitudinal edges. 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that said nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17) are 
made of plastic and that the first nozzle plates (14, 15) are 

formed as casings for said primary part of said linear motor 
(9, 10). 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that said nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17) are 
fabricated out of non-magnetic materials (plastics, glass, 

wood) with supergliding features.  
 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that the conveying route is divided into 
conveying sections and that for every conveying section a linear 

motor (9, 10) with nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17) is provided. 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that for every conveying section two linear 
motors arranged in parallel to each other with space in between 

and nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17) are provided, which 
can be adjusted to the width of said panels. 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 7, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that the space between said parallel linear 
motors (9, 10) with nozzle plates (14, 15, 16, 17) is entirely 

or partially bridged by two additional nozzle plates (20, 21). 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that for the positioning of said panels at 
least two linear motors (9, 10) are arranged at an angle to 

each other. 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 9, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that four linear motors (9, 10) are arranged 
crosswise to each other with said linear motors (9, 10) forming 

the legs of the cross. 
Conveying system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised 
in the fact
 that proximity sensors (13) for said panels 
(22) are provided with said proximity sensors outputting control 

signals to the electric control of said linear motors.
