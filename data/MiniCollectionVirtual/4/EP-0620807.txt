<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for 
the production of a Diels-Alder adduct of 4-vinylcyclohexene 
and cyclopentadiene. More particularly, the 
invention relates to an improved process for the production 
of 5-(3-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2-norbornene. The ring-opening or metathesis polymerization of 
a wide variety of cyclic and polycyclic olefins is well 
known. Numerous patents and literature references, both 
U.S. and foreign, relate to the ring opening polymerization 
of olefins such as dicyclopentadiene in the presence of 
olefin metathesis catalyst systems. An illustrative 
catalyst system is disclosed by Sjardijn et al, U.S. 
4,810,752, wherein substituted phenolic tungsten halides 
are employed in conjunction with triorganotin hydrides. It is characteristic of many if not most ring-opening 
polymerizations that all carbon-carbon double bonds 
present in the ring or rings of the monomeric reactants are 
involved in the ring-opening polymerization. Thus, when 
one or more of the monomeric reactants contains multiple 
carbon-carbon double bonds the resulting polymer is a 
highly crosslinked thermoset polymer. These thermoset 
polymers exhibit a variety of useful properties but the 
nature of such properties is somewhat limited by the highly 
crosslinked character of the polymer. In United States patent No. 5,095,082, there is 
described the preparation of Diels-Alder adducts of 4-vinylcyclo-hexene 
and cyclopentadiene. Among these adducts 
is a mono-adduct, i.e., 5-(3-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2-norbornene. 
The ring-opening polymerization of this adduct is 
particularly useful because the polymer exhibits a varying 
degree of crosslinking, depending in part upon the 
polymerization environment. The resulting polymer, when  
 
not highly crosslinked, is useful in applications not 
available to thermoset polymers. The 5-(3-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2-norbornene adduct, a 
1:1 adduct of 4-vinylcyclohexane and cyclopentadiene, is 
produced together with other products by conventional 
Diels-Alder technology. However, the process selectivity 
to this particular adduct is lower than desired, e.g., 60% 
to 65%. The other reaction products include higher adducts 
of 4-vinylcyclohexene and cyclopentadiene, i.e., adducts 
with a higher proportion of cyclopentadiene, and 
cyclopentadiene oligomers. It would be of advantage to 
provide an improved process to increase the overall 
selectivity of the Diels-Alder process to the desired mono-adduct 
and decrease the overall production of heavier 
products. According to the

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a 1:1 molar adduct of 4-vinylcyclohexene 
and cyclopentadiene comprising the steps of: 


(a) contacting 4-vinylcyclohexene and cyclopentadiene to produce a 
product mixture comprising the 1:1 molar adduct of 4-vinylcyclohexene and 

cyclopentadiene, higher adducts of 4-vinylcyclohexene and cyclopentadiene and 
cyclopentadiene oligomers; 
(b) separating the resulting product mixture into a light product 
comprising primarily said 1:1 molar adduct and a heavy product comprising said 

higher adducts and cyclopentadiene oligomers; 
(c) contacting at least a portion of the heavy product from (b) with 
4-vinylcyclohexene thereby to produce further 1:1 molar adduct of 4-vinylcyclohexene 

and cyclopentadiene; and 
(d) recovering said further 1:1 molar adduct. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the separation of light 
product from heavy product in step (b) is by distillation. 
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the heavy product and 4-vinylcyclohexene 
are contacted in step (c) at a temperature of above 160°C. 
A process according to claim 3 wherein the contact temperature 
is from 180°C to 260°C. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the heavy product 
and 4-vinylcyclohexene are contacted in step (c) at above ambient pressure. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims wherein steps (a) and (c) are 
carried out in a single reactor by recycling at least a portion of the heavy  

 
product from step (b) to step (a), and steps (b) and (d) are combined. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein steps (a) and (c) are 
carried out in separate reactors, and steps (b) and (d) are separate.
