<ABSTRACT>
The pivotable glass pane (3) acting as window is fixed to a frame profile (5), and has sealing components (14) and at least one water deflecting component on the ridge side above the glass pane. On the window frame under construction (10) a sealing profile (14) is arranged around the periphery of the window (3), and on its inside has an all-round water deflecting channel (15). In the closed state of the window, at least on the ridge-side edge of the window, the glass pane (11) of the window lies in the sealing profile (14) so that the upper surface of the sealing profile closes to the upper side of the glass pane (11), and the side edges (21,29) of the glass pane locate in a sealed manner on the sealing profile (14).

A roof glazing system in which stationary (2) and at
least one outwardly-swinging glass element (3) are

affixed to a metal base frame; the swinging glass
element serving as a window (3) is affixed to a frame

(4, 5), and seals (14) have and at least one ridge-side
water runoff channel above the glass element (3),

characterized in that:

There is a seal (14) surrounding a window (3) in a

window frame (10), and there is a peripheral water
runoff channel (15) inside the seal,
When the window (3) is closed, the glass pane (11)
of the window (3) lies in the seal (14) at least at

the ridge-side edge of the window such that the
surface of the seal (14) tightly seals the top of

the glass pane (11), and the side edges (21, 29, 30)
of the glass pane (11) are tightly sealed by the

seal (14),
The edges (20, 30, 32) of the glass pane (11) form a
wall for the water runoff channel (15), and the

window (3) can swing in reference to the seal (14)
on at least one hinge with a pivot (28) on the

window frame base construction (10) on the top edge
of the ridge-side edge (21) of the glass pane (11).
The roof glazing system according to claim 1,
characterized in that the seal (14) has an outer

sealing lip (23) facing the glass pane (11) that abuts
the outer contour of the seal (14).
The roof glazing system according to claim 2,
characterized in that the outer sealing lip (23) lies 

on the surface (25) of the glass pane (11) at the top,
ridge-side edge.
The roof glazing system according to claim 3,
characterized in that the ridge-side edge (21) of the

glass pane (11) lies on a wall (22) of the seal (14)
and seals it.
The roof glazing system according to claims 3 or 4,
characterized in that the top (25) of the glass pane

has a recess (27) adapted to the shape of the sealing
lip (23) at the outer sealing lip (23), and the

sealing lip (23) and glass pane (11) form a flat
surface.
The roof glazing system according to one of claims 2 -
5, characterized in that the outer sealing lips (23')

press against the side (30) edges and the eves-side
edge (29) of the glass pane (11).
The roof glazing system according to claim 6,
characterized in that the edges (29, 30) of the glass

pane (11) are beveled so that the top (25) of the
glass pane (11) extends over the bottom side (19).
The roof glazing system according to one of the prior
claims, characterized in that the water runoff channel

(15) is closed in the direction of the window opening
(18) by at least one sealing lip (17) on which lies

the bottom (19) of the glass pane (11).
The roof glazing system according to one of the prior
claims, characterized in that the seal (14) has a flat

surface (33) on the side facing away from the window
(3). 
The roof glazing system according to claim 9,
characterized in that the flat surface (33) forms a

plane with the top of the stationary glass elements
(2) at least above and below the window (3).
The roof glazing system according to claim 10,
characterized in that the seal (14) has a sealing

surface (35) facing the stationary glass elements (2)
that seals them by their own weight.
The roof glazing system according to one of claims 9 - 11,
characterized in that the flat surface (33) of the

seal (14) on the long edges (30) of the window (3)
serve as a contact surface for clamps (38) that clamp

the seal (14) with the basic frame construction (4).
The roof glazing system according to one of claims 9 - 12,
characterized in that the seal (14) has a second

water runoff channel (36) whose one wall is formed by
the stationary glass elements (2) peak-side above and

eves-side below the window (3), whereby the water
runoff channel (36) is at the edge of the stationary

glass elements (2).
The roof glazing system according to claim 13,
characterized in that the water runoff channel (36) is

closed on the side facing away from the window (3) by
at least one inner sealing lip (37) on which lies the

bottom of a stationary glass element (2).
The roof glazing system according to one of the prior
claims, characterized in that the seal (14) covers an

area (24) that projects from the plane of the
stationary glass elements (2) whose surface at least

tightly seals the top edge of the glass pane (11) of
the window (3) with the top (25) of the glass pane. 
The roof glazing system according to claim 15,
characterized in that the seal (14') has weep holes

(31) at the eves-side of the window (3) that allow
water to exit on the next stationary glass element

(2).
