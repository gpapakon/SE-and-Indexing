<ABSTRACT>
A mounting member (1) for a spring-shock absorber unit (2) in a 
suspension means of the Mc Pherson type comprises an annular retaining 

element (6) fastened to the motor-vehicle body (3), a central thrust 
element (4) fastened to the rod (5a) of a shock absorber (5), and an 

annular spring member (7) interposed between surfaces of truncated 
conical form (8, 9) defined by the annular retaining element (6) and 

central thrust element (4). The central thrust element (4) is embodied 
by a shaped plate 2a integrating a perimetric portion (13) defining a 

rest housing (10a) for the end of a spring (10) disposed around the 
shock absorber (5). The annular retaining element (4) and annular 

spring element (7) are fully disposed under the motor-vehicle body 
(3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mounting member for connecting a 
spring-shock absorber unit to a motor-vehicle body,  
 
the mounting member being accessible through an opening 
in the vehicle body, the mounting member being of the 
type comprising: a central thrust element fastened to 
one end of a shock absorber and exhibiting an outer 
frusto-conical surface faced away from the shock-absorber 
and a rest housing placed at the lower part of 
the thrust element and arranged to operatively engage 
the end of a spring being part of the spring-shock 
absorber unit; an annular retaining element fastened to 
said body and exhibiting an inner frusto-conical 
surface faced towards the outer frusto-conical surface 
of the central thrust element, whereby the annular 
retaining element is fully located in a space disposed 
below the motor-vehicle body; an annular spring member 
made of elastomeric material and operatively interposed 
between the outer frusto-conical surface of the central 
thrust element and the inner frusto-conical surfaces of 
the annular retaining element and arranged to 
elastically counteract axial thrust forces tending to 
move the frusto-conical surfaces close to each other; a 
cup-shaped auxiliary thrust element fastened to the 
shock-absorber such that a base portion thereof is 
adiacent the central thrust element.  
 In greater detail, the mounting member referred to in the present 
description is adapted for use in combination with spring-shock 
absorber units associated with motor-vehicle suspension means of the 
Mc Pherson type. It is known that in suspension means of the above type the spring 
absorption of the dynamic stresses transmitted by the wheel during the 
ride normally relies on an upper spring-shock absorber unit interconnected 
with the motor-vehicle body through an appropriate mounting 
member. Known mounting members, one of which is described in French Patent No. 
2514303 to which reference is herein made as an explanatory example of 
the state of the art, comprise an annular retaining element substantially 
of truncated conical form fastened to the motor-vehicle body 
and projecting upwardly from the body itself, at an opening formed 
therein. Housed in the annular retaining element is an annular member 
made of elastomeric material integrally engaged by a rubber bond with 
an inner surface, of truncated conical form, of the annular retaining  
 
element. The annular member made of elastomeric material in turn houses a 
central thrust element exhibiting an outer
