<ABSTRACT>
The instrument (1) for ablating tissue has a tool (2) which is arranged on the distal end of the instrument and which can be driven via a shaft (3). The shaft extends through the handle (4), which comprises at least one bending site (5), of the instrument (1) and is subdivided at each bending site (5) of the handle (4). The adjacent ends (6a) of the rigid shaft members (6) are connected to one another via at least one universal coupling (7, 15), and each shaft member (8) is mounted in the handle (4). The rigid shaft members (6) and their connections via universal couplings (7, 15) permit large handle bending angles and jerk-free transmission of high torques to the tool (2).
