<ABSTRACT>
A display device of the type having a plurality of 
parallel prisms that rotate intermittently and synchronously to 

present the surfaces of the different panels of each prism for view 
to provide different composite advertising designs. All the prisms 

are identical and each is formed with three identical panels that 
are rectangular and extend longitudinally of the prism. The panels 

have hinge sections formed integrally along their edges for meshing 
with hinge sections of adjacent panels in a piano-hinge-like 

arrangement. A removable hinge pin is disposed in at least one 
hinge connection so that upon removal of the hinge pin the adjacent 

panel can be swung open to allow access to the interior of the 
prism for changing a burned out illuminating device, such as a 

fluorescent or neon light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an advertising device for 
advertising designs that change by having a plurality of rotatable 
prisms which are each preferably triangular, with the surfaces of 
the prisms being exposed sequentially for view with corresponding 
surfaces of other prisms in the device to present different 
advertising displays upon rotation of the prisms and with each 
prism being illuminated from inside as by a stationary lamp. Prism advertising devices of this general type are known 
in the industry. The prisms may be disposed horizontally or 
vertically for display. In large advertising panels taller than 
approximately 2 meters the prisms are normally disposed vertically, 
preferably suspended from the upper end, for the sake of mechanical 
stability. The rectangular panels of each triangular prism are 
joined together by an equilateral triangular base at each end to 
stabilize the arrangement. The drive for pivoting the prism 
generally engages one of these triangular bases, one of which 
usually has an opening through which the mount and the power supply 
of an illumination device, such as a fluorescent or neon lamp, 
extends for mounting the illuminating device within the prism. The 
lamp remains stationary when the prism is pivoted. The pivoting is 
intermittent with all of the prisms pivoting simultaneously to 
present advertising surfaces across the device for viewing in a 
composite design. The lamps used in the advertising devices described have 
a limited, and usually highly variable, service life. Accordingly,  
 
lamps fail without predictability. In prior devices, a failed lamp 
has to be pulled out through one end of the prism, and the new lamp 
is introduced into the prism in the same way. The advertising device of the type described can be 
produced in considerable size, for instance with a height of from 
1 meter to 6 meters and a width of from 2 meters to 20 meters. As 
noted, in relatively large advertising panels the prisms are 
preferably disposed vertically next to one another. If an 
advertising device of this kind is designed for operation in the 
open air, then the prisms and particularly the region above each 
prism must be carefully protected against the effects of weather 
in order to protect the mechanical and electrical parts. If a 
lamp in one prism fails, then the entire prism has to be dismantled 
so that the lamp can be pulled out of the prism. If the cover on 
the top of the prism of an advertising wall has to be removed, 
ladders are needed in order to pull

<CLAIMS>
A display device for displaying designs comprising: 

(a) at least one prism having at least three 
rectangular side panels having display surfaces thereon 

and extending parallel to the axis of said at least one 
prism, said panels having two longitudinal edges and two 

ends with adjacent panels connected to each along said 
longitudinal edges; 
(b) end pieces attached to said ends of at least 
two of said panels to form the bases of said at least one 

prism; 
(c) said two panels being secured together along 
their adjacent longitudinal edges; 
(d) a hinge joining one of said two panels to an 
adjacent third panel along adjacent longitudinal edges 

thereof; 
(e) means releasably securing said third panel to 
an adjacent panel along the longitudinal edge of said 

third panel opposite the hinged edge to allow opening of 
said third panel for access to the interior of said at 

least one prism; 
(f) means for rotating said at least one prism 
about its axis to present said panels individually for 

view; and 
(g) illuminating means including at least one 
replaceable illuminating element disposed within said at 

 
least one prism to illuminate said panels and being 

replaceable when said third panel is open. 
A display device according to claim 1 wherein said 
releasably securing means comprises a substantially continuous 

hinge extending substantially the length of said panels and 
including a removable hinge pin. 
A display device according to claim 2 wherein said 
hinge pin is flexible and capable of bending away from the axis of 

the hinge during removal and insertion of said hinge pin. 
A display device according to claim 2 wherein said 
two panels are secured together by an immobilized hinge. 
A display device according to claim 4 wherein said 
immobilized hinge is substantially continuous the length of said 

longitudinal edges of said panels. 
A display device according to claim 5 wherein each 
of said hinges has sections secured to longitudinal edges of 

adjacent panels. 
A display device according to claim 6 wherein said 
at least three panels with their respective hinge sections secured 

thereto are identical and interchangeable. 
A display device according to claim 1 wherein said 
panels are translucent. 
A display device according to claim 5 wherein said 
panels and said hinges are translucent. 
A display device according to claim 1 wherein each 
said prism comprises an equilateral triangle in its cross section 

and wherein said illuminating element is mounted at a spacing from 
the axis of the prism along a median line of said equilateral 

triangle cross section prism away from the side of an observer of 
an advertisement on the advertising device.
