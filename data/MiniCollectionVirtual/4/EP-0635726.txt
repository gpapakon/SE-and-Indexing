corresponding to a voltage of a system under measurement for

voltage under the control of the control signal (a, b) to 
generate a second voltage, which is the first voltage during 

the power calculating period and the constant voltage during 
the imbalance compensation period. The device further 

includes a Hall element member (3) for generating a third

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power calculating device
using a Hall element, and in particular relates to a power
calculating device wherein imbalance voltage of the Hall
element is automatically compensated.Power calculating devices of this kind are widely
employed for wattmeters and for watthour meters on account
of their simple construction and because the device lends
itself to miniaturization.Such a power calculating device is described in a copending
European patent application published as EP-A-0 601
817, also in the name of the present applicant. EP-A-0 601
817 was filed before but published after the priority date
of the present application. It therefore forms prior art to
the present application only according to Article 54(3) EPC.
The power calculating device of this document will now be 
described with reference to Fig. 7. The voltage of the
system that is the subject of measurement, applied across
terminals P1, P2, is input through a voltage converter 1
consisting of a voltage divider including resistors R1 and
R2 or a transformer circuit to a voltage-current converter
2, where it is converted to a current A with the magnitude 
directly proportional to the input voltage. This current is
applied to current terminals T1, T2 of a Hall element 3 as
the control current of Hall element 3. Hall element 3 is
equipped with output terminals T3, T4 arranged at right
angles with respect to current terminals T1, T2. A magnetic
field B is applied as shown in Fig. 7 in the direction at
right angles to the direction of current terminals T1, T2
and to the direction of output terminals T3, T4 by means of
a magnetic core 20 shown in Fig. 9. A Hall voltage VH of
magnitude given by equation (1) directly proportional to the
product of the magnetic flux density generated by the
magnetic field and the control current flowing between
current terminals T1 and T2 is generated across output
terminals T3, T4 of Hall element 3.
VH = R · B · J
where R is the Hall coefficient, B is the magnetic flux
density, and J is the current density of the control
current. A subtractor 4 is constructed with an operational
amplifier OP1, and resistors R3, R4, R5 and R6. Subtractor
4 outputs a voltage proportional to the product of the
control current and magnetic flux density by removing the in-phase
component of Hall voltage VH generated across output
terminals T3, T4. This voltage is inverted in polarity by
inverting amplifier 5 as a voltage C, which is output
outside as an output of power calculating device. Fig. 8 is
a time-chart
