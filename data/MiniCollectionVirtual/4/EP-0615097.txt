and means making it possible to create a partial vacuum
and a flow of air without recycling the air, characterized

in that they comprise a centrifugal unit (5)
sending air into an air inlet channel (13) which runs out

into the chamber and is associated with an air extraction
channel (19) connected to the chamber (1), the air inlet

channel (13) and the air extraction channel (19) being
separated from each other.
Cooking appliance according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the air inlet channel (13) runs out into

the cooking chamber (1) via at least one calibrated hole
(16).

preceding claims, ch
aracterized in that the air inlet
channel (13) runs out into the chamber (1) level with the

roof heating element or elements (17).
Cooking appliance according to either of Claims
1 and 2, characterized in that the air inlet channel

(13a) is positioned between the rear wall of the chamber
(1) and the insulation, and runs out into the chamber

below the roof heating element or elements (17).
Cooking appliance according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the air extraction

channel (19) runs out into the cooking chamber (1)
via at least one calibrated hole (18).
Cooking appliance according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the calibrated hole or holes (18) are 

produced in the upper wall of the cooking chamber (1).
Cooking appliance according to Claims 2 and 5,
characterized in that the total cross-section of the

calibrated hole or holes (16) of the air intake channel
(13) is less than the total cross-section of the calibrated

hole or holes (18) of the air extraction channel
(19).
Cooking appliance according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the device for

creating a partial vacuum is switched on as soon as the
appliance is put into operation.
