<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spray-chilled nabumetone and a process 
for its manufacture. EP-A-0 362 731 describes melt-sprayed ibuprofen and US 4,086,346 
describes melt-sprayed phenacetin. GB 1,474,377 describes a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 4-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-butan-2-one 
which is commonly known as 
nabumetone. This patent also describes a process for the manufacture of 
nabumetone. Nabumetone is most commonly prescribed as 500 mg or 1000 mg swallow 
tablets. The resulting tablets containing nabumetone and conventional 
excipients are fairly large in size and can be a problem to swallow for 
some patients. Conventionally isolated and milled nabumetone has a poured density 
range of 0.35 to 0.39gcm-3 and a tapped density range of 0.44 to 0.48gcm-3 
and when mixed with conventional excipients produces a tablet volume of 
0.485 cm3 for a 500 mg nabumetone tablet and a volume of 0.970 cm3 for 
a 1000 mg nabumetone tablet. Conventionally isolated and milled nabumetone is formulated into 
conventional swallow tablets by admixing with conventional fillers, 
surfactants and disintegrants. It has been found that the maximum 
amount of drug that can be mixed with excipients, especially fillers, is 
82%. Increasing the percentage of drug further (i.e. reducing the 
percentage of excipients, especially fillers) causes the tablet to be prone to 
breaking up on manufacture, storage and transportation, which is 
obviously a disadvantage. Spray-chilling is a technique that has been in existence for approximately 
30 years, and has been applied to the production of food-stuffs such as 
coffee as well as pharmaceuticals.  
 Spray-chilling is usually chosen because it is a process which produces 
uniform product qualities such as particle size, moisture content and bulk 
density.  
 In pharmaceutical production, spray-chilling is used because it can 
provide products which have improved flow characteristics. It has now been found that spray chilled nabumetone has excellent 
formulation properties, is cheaper to produce and can be surprisingly 
formulated into viable tablets using fewer excipients than were previously 
needed. Furthermore, spray-chilled nabumetone has the unexpected 
advantage of being more dense than conventionally isolated and milled 
nabumetone and can therefore be formulated into smaller tablets which 
are easier to swallow. Accordingly, the present invention provides spray-chilled nabumetone. The present invention further provides spray-chilled nabumetone having 
a poured density
