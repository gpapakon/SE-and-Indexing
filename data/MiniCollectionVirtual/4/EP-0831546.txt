[Purpose] To provide a compact chip antenna and

antenna device having a broad bandwidth.
[Construction] A chip antenna 10 is provided with a

rectangular parallelepiped substrate 11 composed of a
dielectric material (relative dielectric constant: ca.

6.1) containing barium oxide, aluminum oxide and silica as
major components, a spiral conductor 12 wound in the

substrate 11 along the longitudinal direction of the
substrate 11, a feeding terminal 13 formed on the surface

of the substrate 11 and connected to one end of the
conductor 12 for applying a voltage to the conductor 12,

and a linear capacitor-forming conductor 14 formed in the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chip antennas and
antenna devices. In particular, the present invention
relates to a chip antenna and an antenna device used in
mobile communication and mobile communication devices for
local area networks (LAN).Figure 12(a) is a plan view of a conventional chip
antenna and Figure 12(b) is a cross-sectional view taken
along section line A-A of Figure 12(b). This chip antenna 1
is of a microstrip type and is provided with a radiation
electrode 3 as an antenna element on a main surface of a
planar dielectric substrate 2 and a ground electrode 4 on
the other main surface of the substrate 2. The dielectric
substrate 2 is a planar rectangular member comprising a
dielectric ceramic material such as aluminum or a polymeric
compound. The radiation electrode 3 is smaller than the
dielectric substrate 2, whereas the ground electrode 4 is
formed on the entire main surface of the dielectric
substrate 2. The ground electrode 4 is connected to an
external conductor 6 of a coaxial cable 5 and the radiation
electrode 3 is connected to a central conductor 7 at the
feeding point 8.The resonance frequency f and the bandwidth BW of the
chip antenna 1 are determined by the following equations in
response to the shape of the antenna:
f = Co/2·(ε)1/2·lBW = (K·d·f)/ε
wherein Co is the velocity of light, ε is the relative
dielectric constant of the dielectric substrate 2, 1 is a
vertical length of the radiation electrode 3 as the antenna
element, K is a constant of proportionality, and d is the
thickness of the dielectric substrate 2 shown in Figure
12(b). When the resonance frequency f is constant, use of a
material having a large relative dielectric constant as the
dielectric substrate 2 is capable of reducing the vertical
length 1 of the radiation electrode 3, thus miniaturizing
the chip antenna 1.When the resonance frequency, however, is constant in
the above-mentioned conventional antenna, a miniaturized
antenna having a large relative dielectric constant has a
narrow bandwidth and is not suitable for mobile
communication devices which requires a broad bandwidth.
Miniaturization of the antenna is therefore barely
compatible with a broad bandwidth. EP 0 621 653 A2 concerns a surface-mountable antenna unit
having a dielectric substrate and a planar radiator opposed
to a top surface of the substrate. One end of the radiator
is connected to a feed portion on one side surface of the
substrate, and the other end is connected to a ground
electrode on an other side surface of the substrate.EP 0 687
