<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiant heater, in particular for heating a vitroceramic hob (ceramic hob), having a surface which carries an electrical heating conductor, this surface being the top surface of an insulation body which comprises a bearing layer and/or a heat-insulating microporous insulation layer, and having a shell-shaped enclosure which surrounds the insulation body in an annular manner. The radiant heater is characterised in that the bearing layer and/or the enclosure and/or the microporous insulation layer contains a highly porous fibre-free inorganic material, for example vermiculite. A particularly preferred configuration provides a fibre-free radiant heater.

Radiator, in particular in a radiative heater for 
heating a glass-ceramic hotplate, having an area bearing 

an electrical heating element, with this area being the 
surface of an insulator (3) which comprises a mounting 

layer and/or a thermally insulating microporous 
insulation layer, and having a dish-shaped enclosure (2) 

which forme an annular surround around the insulator (3), 
characterized in that the mounting layer and/or the 

enclosure and/or the microporous insulation layer 
comprises a highly porous, fibre-free inorganic material 

and the bottom of the enclosure (2) has a circular 
opening (6) which is filled by the insulator (3). 
Radiator according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the inorganic material is a representative or a 

mixture of representatives selected from the groups 
consisting of the expanded sheet silicates, the highly 

porous volcanic rocks, the silicified fossil earths and 
the plant ashes. 
Radiator according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the inorganic material is 

vermiculite. 
Radiator according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the microporous insulation layer is 

fibre-free. 
Radiator according to any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the electrical heating element is 

adhesively bonded to, stapled to or partly pressed into 
the surface of the insulator. 
Use of the radiator according to any of Claims 1 
to 5 for heating a glass-ceramic hotplate, for heating 

baking ovens, grills and in heating or halogen radiators.
