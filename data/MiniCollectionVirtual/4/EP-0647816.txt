<ABSTRACT>
Incineration system in which liquid toxic residues are pumped from a 
tank (1) and injected by an injector (4) into the melt of a reactor (6) 

equipped with four burners in the upper part and maintained at a 
temperature of 1.550⁰ C. The cover of the reactor is provided with an 

outlet (9) for the fumes passing a duct (10) to a combustion chamber 
(11) with three burners (12) and an air intake system (13) through the 

refractory pipe (14). The flue gases flow through this refractory pipe 
to a steam boiler (15), which is connected to a turbine (17) with 

generator (18). Through pipe (20) the flue gases enter a duct (21) for 
treatment with chemical reagents and pass a electrostatic filter (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an incinerator for toxic residues which permits 
their total elimination letting in the end only an emission of aggregate 
under the form of dross. Particularly in the big cities actually are 
used large incinerators which destroy by combustion all the waste. In the case that it was necessary to act on toxic residues for the 
human body and for the environment for making inert the combustion 
residues are now used higher temperatures. In said plants the toxic 
residues are initially subjected to a preliminary treatment into pre-combustion 
sectors by means of burners and then they reach for the 
working completion into a combustion rotating chamber also this one 
equipped with the already said means. These plants have the big problem 
to request for their realization large structures with consequent very 
high execution and operating costs, while in the working they present 
an intrinsic slowness in the treatments since the temperatures to be 
used must be put in relation each time to the kind and in particular 
to the danger of the working materials. Moreover said plants do 
not offer an acceptable security on the working residue inertization 
since the index of danger can to be not identified with exactness and 
however the temperature can result insufficient in relation to the 
combustion type that these current means used. To all already said 
is then necessary to add that, since said combustion system creates 
a drought, it is generated a dust environment with consequent necessity 
for its elimination of the constant blasting of the dusts on the working 
material. The invented plant by using a new treatment system, where 
the toxic residues are put under temperature of about 1.550°, principally 
permits in comparison with the said current system a structural semplification 
of the plant consequently reducing the realization and operating  
 
costs, a security in the residue inertization so to avoid damages to 
the human body and to the environment, a smaller quantity of said residue 
and to increase the working velocity. Acting at about m. 1,20 of depth 
the injector injects the toxic residues to a pressure of 15-20 BAR 
into a bath to be maintained at 1.550° where is actuated their elimination 
by combustion while the remaining aggregate emerges over the fluid. Substantially the invented device foresees a tank 1 from which by a 
pump 2 through a flexible pipe 3 the toxic goods are injected by an 
injector 4 through an inlet 5 into a reactor 6, formed by a three-fase 
arc

<CLAIMS>
Elimination plant for toxic residues foreseen a tank (1) from which 
by a pump (2) through a flexible pipe (3) the toxic goods are injected 

by an injector (4) through an inlet (5) into a reactor (6) where they 
begin their combustion with consequent scorification in progression 

and foreseen a cover (8), characterized in that losting in their weight 
density the combustion residues come to float onto the cast steel to 

be maintained to a temperature of 1.550° by means of four burners (7) 
helicoidally distributed till a some distance from the cover (8) so 

permitting also to neutralize the gas exhalation of the working goods 
into the plant space where is not present the bath; onto the same cover 

(8) is foreseen a hole (9) acting as intake stack for the fumes passing 
into a duct (10) to be then let into combustion chamber (11) equipped 

with three burners (12); the fumes burning into combustion chamber 
(11) by means of an intake system (13) foreseen on the bottom coming 

into a refractory pipe (14) where is actuated their total combustion 
with elimination of the eventual toxins remain in sospension; said 

fumes then come into a steam boiler (15) and through a duct (16) they 
come into a steam turbine (17), connected to a hi pot generator (18), 

they come out to a mouth (19) of the steam boiler (15) and, through 
a larger refractory duct (20) to determine their slowdown they pass 

into a duct (21) where are treated with chemical reagents which determine 
the fragmentation while the suspended particles are kept by an electrostatic 

filter (22). 
Elimination plant for toxic residues, as per claim 1), in which 
the injector (4) foresees a main (23) with in its inside a pipe (24) 

where flows the under pressure water to act cooling, said flow through 
a mouth (25) comes to flood all the inside part of the jnector with 

outlet permits through an other mouth (26); the toxic reasidues go 
through a duct (27) and they go out from the bottom (28); to permit 

their combustion it is used such burning compressed air to be injected 
through a duct (29). 
Elimination plant for toxic residues, as per claim 1), in which the 
combustion residues formed by slags are then discharged through an 

outlet (30) rotating of about 10° the reactor (6). 
Elimination plant for toxic residues characterized in that can be 
provided that the outlet (30) for discharging the working residues 

was also used to load the toxic residues from containers or drums. 
Elimination plant for toxic residues, as per claim 1), in that the 
reactor (6) is to be put into a hollow under the floor for a suitable 

disposition of its casting ladle structure and to make easy the control 
operations of the cast steel.
