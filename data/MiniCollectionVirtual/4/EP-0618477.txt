<ABSTRACT>
A counterelectrode for a smart window contains a 
transparent substrate and a linear electrically conductive 

material formed on a surface of the transparent substrate. 
The electrically conductive material has a surface area of not 

less than 10 m²/g. A smart window contains an electrochromic 
electrode having a layer of an electrochromic material formed 

on its surface, and a layer of an electrolyte arranged between 
the counterelectrode and the electrochromic electrode and in 

contact with the layer of the electrochromic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
smart window based upon electrochromism.In recent years, the development in an
electrochromic element based upon electrochromism, referred to
herein as a smart window, is proceeding briskly. The smart
window usually comprised of an electrochromic material and an
electrolyte sandwiched between a transparent electrode and a
counterelectrode, is a device which changes color with good
color contrast on current conduction and current interruption.
That is, when the current is supplied to the smart window, its
electrochromic material is colored and, once it is colored, it
is not bleached, that is it does not lose color, and can only
be bleached when the current is caused to flow in the reverse
direction. The smart window is expected to be used in future
in a variety of applications, because it is not in need of the
electric power except during coloring and during bleaching,
and can be controlled more easily than a liquid crystal
display device.An electrochromic material for the smart window
which is colored by reduction, such as WO3, MoO3, V2O5, Nb2O5
or TiO2, and an electrochromic material which is colored by 
oxidation, such as Cr2O3, MnO2, CoO or NiO, have been employed.
If such electrochromic material is used as one of the
electrodes, it is required that the other electrode mounted
facing the above-mentioned electrode with the electrolyte in-between,
be transparent or light-transmitting or be colored in
a complementary manner when driving the device in operation.If an ITO glass commonly used as a transparent
electrode of a common smart window is used as a
counterelectrode of the smart window, the electrochromic
efficiency becomes insufficient because of a smaller
electrochemical capacity per unit area. If the electrical
voltage applied across the electrodes is raised for improving
the electrochromic efficiency, the cycle life of the
coloration and bleaching cycles of the smart window is
diminished.Also, with a view to producing a smart window having
a high electrochromic efficiency, it has been proposed in, for
example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications Nos. 62-151826
(1987), 62-204235 (1987) and 1-226122 (1989) to make combined
use of an electrochromic material colored by reduction and an
electrochromic material colored by oxidation within the inside
of one and the same smart window.However, none of the above-described prior-art
materials or methods is as yet fully satisfactory as to the
cycle life of the coloration and bleaching cycles under
conditions of the higher
