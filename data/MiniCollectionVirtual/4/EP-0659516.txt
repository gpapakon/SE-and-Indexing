<ABSTRACT>
In an ultrasonic welding tool with a longitudinal oscillation-generating sonic transducer (1) coupled to one end of a resonator (3) of length one or more times lambda/2, the novelty is that a second longitudinal oscillation-generating sonic transducer (2) is coupled to the free end of the resonator (3) and oscillates synchronously with the first transducer (1).

<CLAIMS>
An ultrasonic welding apparatus having a first sound transducer
(1) for producing longitudinal oscillations of a wavelength lambda and a

bar-shaped resonator (3) of a length lambda/2 or a multiple thereof, which
is coupled to the sound transducer (1) at one end , wherein coupled to the

free end of the resonator (3) is a second sound transducer (2) for
producing longitudinal oscillations, which oscillates synchronously with the

first sound transducer (1), characterised in that the feed of current to the
second sound transducer (2) is effected axially through the resonator (3).
A ultrasonic welding apparatus according to claim 1 characterised
in that the length of the resonator (3) corresponds to an even-numbered

multiple of lambda/2.
An ultrasonic welding apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that coupling of the resonator (3) to the transducers (1, 2)

is effected by means of transformation portions.
