<ABSTRACT>
In a method of manufacturing a ski, a partially reinforced surface shell material is horizontally inserted into the mould between the mould upper part and the mould lower part or is laterally guided between the mould upper part and the mould lower part in a groove which is so designed that the shell material or composite can move during the mould filling operation and unmould, without plastic deformation, the contour exactly predetermined by the inner surface of the mould upper part. The surface shell material used in this method is reinforced with high-strength materials, preferably partially, but in the middle region over the length of the ski. In a device for implementing the method, recesses or protuberances of the inner surface of the outer mould are formed by insertable mould parts.
