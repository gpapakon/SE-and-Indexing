<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to therapeutic
agents, and in particular to substituted 4(5)-amino-1,8-naphthyridines,
to processes for their preparation, to
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their
therapeutic activity as anti-rheumatic agents.Rheumatoid arthritis is currently treated with
anti-inflammatory agents, which alleviate the symptoms
but do not affect the progression of the condition, or
with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs e.g. gold
compounds, D-penicillamine, sulphasalazine, azathioprine
and methotrexate. However, most disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs are associated with side-effects,
often of a serious nature. This means that such drugs
are often only used as a last resort in the most serious
cases. Consequently a need exists for a less toxic,
disease-modifying, antirheumatic drug which may be
administered orally.EP 0,361,177 discloses compounds of formula A

in which R represents alkyl, cyclopropyl, methylamino
and p-fluorophenyl; R1 represents hydrogen or a C1-2
alkyl group; R2 represents halo and A represents -CH- or
a nitrogen atom. It is disclosed that these compounds
may be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis by intra-articular
administration. Japanese patent application number 38774/69,
publication number J47-29519 (1972) discloses ethyl
4-anilino-7-methyl-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylate
amongst a number of compounds which are prepared as
intermediates for use in the preparation of anti-bacterial
agents. It is suggested that these
intermediates possess anti-bacterial and antiprotozoal
activity but no results are given.2-Diethylaminomethyl-4-(7'-methyl-1',8'-naphthyridin-4'-ylamino)phenol
and 2-diethylaminomethyl-4-(1',8'-naphthyridin-4-ylamino)phenol
are disclosed in
the Australian Journal of Chemistry, 1984, 37, 1065 as
having minimal anti-malarial activity.The present invention relates to compounds of
formula I

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in which
R1 represents hydrogen, a C1-6 alkyl group, hydroxy, a
carboxy C2-4 alkenyl group, a C2-6 alkoxycarbonyl C2-4
alkenyl group, a hydroxy C1-6 alkyl group, a carboxy
C1-4 alkyl group, a C2-6 alkoxycarbonyl C1-4 alkyl
group, a C1-6 alkoxy group, a halogenated C1-6 alkyl
group, a carboxy group, a C2-6 alkoxycarbonyl group or a
C1-6 alkanoylamino group;R2 represents hydrogen, halo, a C1-6 alkoxy group,
hydroxy, a C1-6 alkanoyloxy group, or a phenoxy group 
(which may be optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl
group, halo or a C1-4 alkoxy group);R3 represents hydrogen or a C1-4 alkyl group;R4 represents
