<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to acidic liquid detergent compositions 
for bathrooms. Such compositions typically contain 
detergent surfactants, detergent builders, and/or solvents to 
accomplish their cleaning tasks. The use of acidic cleaning compositions containing organic 
water-soluble synthetic detergents, solvents, and/or detergent 
builders for bathroom cleaning tasks are known. However, such 
compositions are not usually capable of providing superior hard 
surface cleaning for all of the soils encountered in a bathroom. 
An exception is the compositions of U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,393, 
Linares and Cilley, issued Oct. 29, 1991, said patent being 
incorporated herein by reference. The object of the present invention is to provide additional 
detergent compositions which also provide good and/or improved 
cleaning for all of the usual hard surface cleaning tasks found in 
the bathroom including the removal of hard-to-remove soap scum and 
hard water deposits. The present disclosure relates to an aqueous, acidic hard 
surface detergent composition comprising: (a) a detergent surfactant 
system which comprises either: (1) a mixture of zwitterionic 
detergent surfactant as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,393, 
preferably a fatty acyl amidoalkylenebetaine, and/or amphoteric 
(non-zwitterionic) detergent surfactant, preferably N-(C₈₋₁₄acylamidoalkylene)amidoglycinate, 
with nonionic detergent surfactant; 
or, less desirably, (2) a low sudsing, nonionic detergent surfactant 
that is a C₇₋₁₀E₃₋₁₂, preferably C₈₋₁₀E₃₋₈, nonionic detergent 
surfactant at a level of at least about 0.1%, preferably from 
about 1% to about 5%, the nonionic detergent surfactant in (1) and 
(2) preferably being either a C₈ or mixture of C₈ and C₁₀ alkyl  
 
nonionic detergent surfactants with the C₈ being at least about 
0.1% of the mixture; (b) a suds reducing amount of a 
Cn(PO)x(EO)y(PO)z compound in which n is a number from about 6 to 
about 12, preferably from about 6 to about 10, x is a number from 
about 1 to about 6, preferably from about 2 to about 4; y is a 
number from about 4 to about 15, preferably from about 5 to about 
12; and z is a number from about 4 to about 25, preferably from 
about 6 to about 20, (c) optionally, but preferably, hydrophobic 
solvent that provides a primary cleaning function, preferably 
butoxypropoxypropanol, and/or, e.g., the other solvents described 
in U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,393; and (d) polycarboxylate detergent 
builder, preferably a dicarboxylic acid, having two carboxyl 
groups separated by
