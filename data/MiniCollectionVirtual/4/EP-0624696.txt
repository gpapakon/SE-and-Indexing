<ABSTRACT>
A lightweight construction panel assembly includes a 
connection strip (80) arranged to be bolted onto a support structure (98), 

and a plurality of panels (10) arranged for mounting onto the connection 
strip and in generally partially overlapping side by side arrangement 

with each other. Each of the plurality of panels (10) includes 
first and second edge portions (12,14) at opposite sides of the 

panel. The connection strip including a third edge portion (90). The 
first edge portion (12) of each panel (10) is configured for mating 

engagement with the third edge portion (90) of the connection strip (80) 
and simultaneously with the second edge portion (14) of an adjacent 

panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to modular 
construction elements and more particularly to lightweight panels 
such as may be used for roofing and the like. There are available in the market many different types 
of lightweight, plastic, modular, roofing panels. A particularly successful lightweight plastic modular 
roofing panel is manufactured and sold by the present 
applicant/assignee and is described in U.S. Patent 5,050,362. A 
listing of relevant prior publications and discussion of the 
prior art appears in the patent. U.S. Patent 5,050,362 describes 
a panel which is directly bolted onto a support structure.  The present invention seeks to provide a lightweight, 
modular construction panel assembly including a connection strip 
which is bolted onto a support structure and panel elements which 
are retained by snap fit engagement onto the support structure 
and to each other. There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention a lightweight construction 
panel assembly including a connection strip arranged to be bolted 
onto a support structure, a plurality of panels arranged for 
mounting onto the connection strip and in generally partially 
overlapping side by side arrangement onto each other, each of the 
plurality of panels including first and second edge portions at 
opposite sides of the panel, the connection strip including a 
third edge portion, the first edge portion of each panel being 
configured for mating engagement with the third edge portion of 
the connection strip and simultaneously with the second edge 
portion of an adjacent panel. Preferably, the second edge portion of the panel overlies 
the first edge portion as well as the connection strip when 
the assembly is fully assembled. It is a particular feature of the invention that the 
panel structure enables substantially unlimited longitudinal 
thermal expansion of the panels.  The present invention will be more fully understood and 
appreciated from the following detailed description, taken in 
conjunction with the drawings in which: 
Figs. 1A, 1B and 1C are each a sectional illustration 
of a panel constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention; Fig. 2 is an exploded cut-away perspective view illustration 
of a construction panel assembly employing the panel of 
Figs. 1A, 1B and 1C; Fig. 3 is an exploded sectional view illustration of a 
first stage in the mounting of the construction panel assembly of 
Fig. 2; Fig. 4 is an

<CLAIMS>
A lightweight construction panel assembly including: 
   a connection strip arranged to be bolted onto a support 

structure; 
   a plurality of panels arranged for mounting onto the 

connection strip and in generally partially overlapping side by 
side arrangement onto each other, 

   each of the plurality of panels including first and 
second edge portions at opposite sides of the panel, 

   the connection strip including a third edge portion, 
   the first edge portion of each panel being configured 

for mating engagement with the third edge portion of the connection 
strip and simultaneously with the second edge portion of an 

adjacent panel. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and wherein said second 
edge portion of the panel overlies the first edge portion as well 

as the connection strip when the assembly is fully assembled. 
A lightweight construction panel including top and 
bottom surfaces and first and second edge portions at opposite 

sides of the panel, 
   the first edge portion of each panel being configured 

for mating engagement with the second edge portion of an adjacent 
panel, and 

   the top surface extending smoothly over the second edge 
portion, so as to entirely cover the first edge portion when two 

adjacent panels are in mating engagement. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims and 
wherein said second edge portion includes a pair of spaced protrusions 

which are seatable into a pair of corresponding recesses 
defined in said first edge portion. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 and wherein one of said 
pair of spaced protrusions and a corresponding one of said pair 

of recesses are formed with interlocking teeth for retaining 
against disengagement.
