<ABSTRACT>
The noise emitted by a wind turbine is reduced by securing of a 
plurality of 

acoustically absorbing tiles (6) to the surface of the wind turbine 
support tower. Each 

tower is formed by high density layer (2) linked to the wind turbine 
surface by a layer of plastics foam material (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to noise emission reduction and particularly to the 
reduction of noise emitted by the tower of a wind turbine. Wind turbines conventionally comprise a tall tower of circular or polygonal 
cross-section with a nacelle mounted at the top, the nacelle mounting a large multi-bladed 
propeller rotating about the horizontal axis and connected through a system 
of gears to an electrical generator also contained within the nacelle, the nacelle is 
arranged to rotate about a vertical axis on top of the tower so as to keep the propeller 
disc facing into the wind. All of the parts driven by the turbine mechanically are 
contained within the upper nacelle and electrical power generated within the nacelle 
is carried down the tower and away to its destination by cables and rotary electrical 
connectors. Since the wind turbine includes a propeller disc comprising a plurality of aerodynamic 
vanes over which the wind moves and contains rotating machinery the wind 
turbine inevitably generates noise. Due to the necessity to place wind turbines on 
high windswept points and due to the fact that the noise is generated by the parts at 
the top of the wind turbine such noise can be a problem over a large area around the 
wind turbine since the noise can travel along a direct straight line path to considerable 
distances without encountering any absorbing obstruction. This problem is accentuated by the fact that most wind turbines generate noise  
 
at one or more discrete frequencies which are distinctive of the wind turbine design 
as well as generating noise across a continuous spectrum so where a farm of a 
number of identical wind turbines is set up their combined noise at these discrete 
frequencies, being at the same frequency for all of the turbines, can carry for several 
miles. It has been found that a major source of this noise is mechanical vibrations 
generated by the moving parts inside the nacelle which are transmitted into the nacelle 
structure and then into the tower. This mechanical vibration causes the tower 
structure to vibrate and it is this vibration of the tower structure which emits the noise. It has been attempted to solve this problem by fitting vibration isolating mounts 
between the machinery in the nacelle and the actual nacelle and tower structures but 
this has not been fully effective in eliminating this noise. This invention was intended to eliminate or at least reduce noise emission from 
wind turbine towers. This invention provides apparatus for reducing noise
