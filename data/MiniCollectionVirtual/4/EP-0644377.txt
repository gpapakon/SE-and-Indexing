<ABSTRACT>
In a gas/air control device, the differential pressure signal which is characteristic of the combustion air throughput is linked pneumatically (35, 36, 38, 40, 41) to the outlet gas pressure (Pg) and an actuating variable for the diaphragm-controlled main gas valve (15) is obtained from this.

Control apparatus for controlling the supply of gas and combustion air to a burner 
dependent on the demand for heat of a load, whereat 


a) an output signal of a heat demand controller controls the supply of combustion air; 
b) a differential pressure measuring device (34, 35, 45) generates a differential pressure 
signal which is proportional to the air flow rate and feeds this signal to the diaphragm 

chambers (45, 37) of a pneumatic control module (26); 
c) the pneumatic output signal of the control module (26) acts upon the diaphragm (23) 
of diaphragm operated main gas valve (15) provided within the gas supply passage 

(16, 17, 39); 
d) the control chamber (24) of the main gas valve (15) on the one side is connected to 
the gas inlet side (16) of the main valve via a first throttle (25) and on the other side is 

connected to a bleed valve (27, 28, 29) within control module (26) with the closure 
member (27) of said bleed valve being carried by the diaphragm (28) of the control 

module; and 
e) the pressure chamber (45) of the control module (26) is connected to the high 
pressure side (35) ofthe differential pressure measuring device (34, 35, 45); 
 
   
characterized in that
 
f) the bleed chamber (37) ofthe control module (26) on the one side is connected to the 

outlet (39) of the main valve (15) via a second throttle (38) and at the other side is 
connected to the low pressure side (36) of the differential pressure measuring device 

(34, 35, 45) via a third throttle (40). 
Control apparatus of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the diaphragm (28) of 
the control module abuts via a spring (32) against an abutment (33) which is adjustable 

within the housing of the control module (26). 
Control apparatus of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the first, second 
and/or third throttle (25, 38, 40) is adjustable. 
Control apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 a fourth 
adjustable throttle (43) is provided within the gas supply pipe (39, 17, 14) between the  

 
branch (39) to the second throttle (38) and the port (14) into the gas/air passage (42) for 

the burner (3). 
Control apparatus according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized by
 such 
a dimension or adjustment of the second (38) and third (40) throttles that:
