<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image sensor arrays used in 
raster input scanners, and in particular to photosensitive elements which 
minimize unintended capacitance and the incidental effects of such 
capacitance on signal output. Image sensor arrays typically comprise a linear array of 
photosites which raster scan an image bearing document and convert the 
microscopic image areas viewed by each photosite to image signal charges. 
Following an integration period, the image signal charges are amplified 
and transferred to a common output line or bus through successively 
actuated multiplexing transistors. In the scanning process, bias and reset 
charges are applied in a predetermined time sequence during each scan 
cycle. Where the array employs two stage transfer circuits for transferring 
the image signal charges from the photosites, the bias charge is applied to 
each photosite through a charge injection transistor and the first transistor 
in the two stage transfer circuit. The reset charge is applied through a reset 
charge injection transistor and the second transistor of the two stage 
transfer circuit. It has been found in applications of sensor arrays that an 
important design variable which must be taken into account in a high-precision 
device is the incidental capacitance of individual photodiodes in 
the array. When a photodiode is exposed to light, electron-hole pairs are 
created in a given region. However, these electron-hole pairs charge the 
"junction capacitance" within the photodiode. The extent of the 
capacitance of the photodiode in a given situation will vary depending on 
the local physical doping of the silicon, and this variable capacitance may  
 
affect the entire system. Also, the normal distribution of energy of mobile 
charge causes uncertainty (noise) in the charge on a capacitor at any given 
time, and this also affects the system. The capacitance of the photodiodes 
in an array thus act as a significant source of noise and voltage variation, 
reducing system S/N (signal/noise ratio). The problem of junction capacitance in photodiodes has led to 
numerous, relatively complicated modifications of basic circuits in prior art 
designs. US-A-4,499,384 discloses an image sensing device having a 
plurality of photoreceiving elements formed on a substrate in a single 
array. Each element includes a photodiode and a blocking diode which are 
connected in series and opposite direction. In Figure 10 of the reference, a 
parallel extra capacitor is used in conjunction with the
