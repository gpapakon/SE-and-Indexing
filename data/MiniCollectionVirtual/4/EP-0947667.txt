<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structure of a seal
ring separating surface for a gas turbine, which sets a shape

of an end portion in the separation surface to a perpendicular
cutting surface and reduces a leaking amount of a sealing air.

A seal ring holding ring (1) within a stationary blade fixes
brush seals (3, 4) to an upstream side by bolts (5, 6)

respectively, so as to form a seal with respect to a rotor disc
(69). Further, it fixes and supports a seal ring (2) to a

downstream side by a bolt (7) so as to constitute a seal with
respect to a seal portion (8) in a disc (69) side. The brush

seals (3, 4) and the seal ring (2) are structured such as to
have a circular ring shape and a separation construction, and

each of the separation pieces has a gap, so that a sealing air
leaks to a downward side from an upward side through the gap,

however, since the separation piece end portion is formed in a
perpendicular cutting surface and a shape of the gap is formed

in a bypass passage, a resistance of an air flow passage is
increased and a leaking air amount is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a seal structure for a
gas turbine, and more particularly to a seal separating surface
connecting structure which reduces a leaked air amount from a
seal separating surface and improves a sealing performance, and
a structure which employs a brush seal so as to prevent a
support plate of the brush seal from doubly contacting with a
rotation side and makes a sealing interval small so as to
improve a sealing performance. An example of such a seal structure is disclosed in
EP 0 816 726 A.Fig. 9 is a cross sectional view which shows a
general seal structure for a conventional gas turbine. In the
drawing, reference numeral 61 denotes a stator blade, reference
numeral 62 denotes an outer shroud thereof, and the outer shroud
62 is supported to a blade ring 70. Reference numeral 63
denotes an inner shroud, reference numeral 64 denotes a flange
portion thereof and reference numeral 65 denotes a seal ring
holding ring. The seal ring holding ring 65 is held to the
flange portion 64 of the inner shroud 63, and supports a seal
ring 66 in an inner side (a rotor side) thereof reference 
numerals 67 and 68 denote a seal portion, and seal fins 67a and
67b are provided in a side of a rotor disc 69, thereby
constituting a seal portion in opposition to the seal portion of
the seal ring 66. Reference numeral 81 denotes a rotor blade,
and reference numeral 82 denotes a platform thereof, which is
mounted to the rotor disc in adjacent to the stator blade 81 and
rotates together with the rotor. Reference numeral 71 denotes
a tube for a sealing air, which is provided within the stator
blade 61, extends through the inner shroud 63 from the outer
shroud 62 and is structured such as to introduce the sealing air
within a cavity 75. Reference numerals 72, 73 and 74 denote a
space formed with respect to the adjacent rotor blade.In the stator blade having the structure
mentioned above, an air 40 introduced from an inner portion of
the sealing air tube 71 within the stator blade 61 to an inner
portion of the cavity 75 passes through a hole 65a in the seal
ring holding ring 65 and flows to enter into the space 72 as
shown by reference symbol 40a, and a part thereof flows out
from the space 72 to the space 73 as a leaking air from the
seal portion 68 as shown by reference symbol 40b, passes
between the platforms of the rotor blade adjacent to the inner
shroud 13 therefrom as shown by reference symbol 40c and flows
out to a main current gas passage.Further, the air also flows out to the space 74
from the space 72
