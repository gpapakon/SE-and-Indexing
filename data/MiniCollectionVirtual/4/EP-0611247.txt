<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic machining apparatus (10) is fastened to a displaceable slide (3). It has a through-bore (11), to the free end of which a differential screw (14) with a first thread is screwed. To clamp a tool (20), first of all the apparatus (10) is returned to the initial position in which a key (25) mounted in a fixed position engages in the screw (14) and the latter bears with slight prestress against a shoulder of the key (25). The key (25) is turned in such a way that the differential screw (14) projects to a certain extent beyond the apparatus (10). The tool (20) is now screwed onto the screw (14) until it comes to bear on the apparatus (10), and finally the screw is tightened by means of a cylinder (32). Automatic tool change is made possible by this type of clamping and a precise position of the screw (14) is obtained.

Method for clamping a tool (20) in a machining
unit (10) of a machine tool, in particular an

ultrasound machine tool, the tool (20), in the
clamped-in position, being connected to the machining

unit (10) via a differential screw (14), and the
machining unit (10) having a bore (11) which is coaxial

with respect to the differential screw (14) and in
which a spanner (25) for turning the differential screw

(14) is arranged, characterized in that the spanner
(25) is held so that it cannot be displaced axially, in

that the machining unit (10) is moved into a position
in which an end face (27) of the spanner (25) bears

against the differential screw (14), in that the
spanner (25) is rotated in such a way that the

differential screw (14) projects to a predetermined
extent beyond a butting surface (15) of the machining

unit (10), in that the tool (20) is then screwed onto
the differential screw (14) until it comes into

frictional engagement with the machining unit (10), and
in that finally the differential screw (14) is

tightened with an adjustable torque by means of the
spanner (25).
Method according to Claim 1, in which the
predetermined extent to which the differential screw

(14) projects is determined by measuring the position
of the machining unit (10).
Method according to Claim 2, in which the
position is measured by means of a sensor (40) which, 

via a control unit (41), controls a servo motor (31)
for turning the spanner (25).
Method according to one of Claims 1-3, in which
the tool (20) is screwed onto the differential screw

(14) by means of an automatic tool changer (42).
Machine tool for carrying out the method
according to one of Claims 1-4, comprising:


a carriage (3) which can be displaced along
guides (1) of a frame (2),
a double-acting lifting member (4) for moving
the carriage (3),
a machining unit (10) which is mounted on the
carriage (3) and has a coaxial, continuous bore

(11),
a differential screw (14), with surfaces (24)
on which a spanner can engage, which is screwed

into the machining unit (10) at one end,
coaxially with respect to the bore (11), using

a first screw thread (13),
a spanner (25), which is inserted into the bore
(11) with a degree of play, for engaging into

the spanner-engagement surfaces (24) and with
an end face (27) for butting against the

differential screw (14), the spanner (25) being
mounted on the housing (2) in such a way that

it can be turned but cannot be moved in the
axial direction,
a rotary drive (32-35) for the spanner and,
a measuring component (40) for measuring the
travel of the carriage (3) adjacent to its

withdrawn basic position.
Machine tool according to Claim 5, in which, in
addition, a device (42) for automatically positioning a

tool (20) and screwing it onto the second screw thread
(22) of the differential screw (14) is present.
Machine tool according to Claim 5 or 6, in
which the rotary drive of the spanner (25) comprises a

drive (32, 33, 34) which can be switched on in order to
apply an adjustable torque. 
Machine tool according to Claim 7, in which the
switchable drive (32, 33, 34) comprises a toothed wheel

(34) which can be connected to the spanner (25) via a
coupling (35), a rack (33) which meshes with the

toothed wheel (34) and a cylinder unit (32) which is
connected to the rack (33).
Machine tool according to one of Claims 5-8, in
which the spanner (25) can be turned by means of a

servo motor (31) which is controlled, via a control
unit (41), by the measuring component (40).
