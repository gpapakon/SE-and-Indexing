<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a memory relay system for observation spacecraft, for example observation satellites or interplanetary probes. The purpose of the invention is to alleviate either the absence, or the possible shortcomings of memories installed on these craft. The system according to the invention thus affords a solution of substitution, which confers its full efficiency on an observation system capable of acquiring and of transmitting observation data, but not of storing them. According to the invention, an artificial satellite or craft comprising at least one transponder and at least one memory which can be written to is placed in the vicinity of an observation satellite or of a probe. The transponder will be capable of receiving the signals transmitted by the latter, and then of transmitting the signals to earth or to another destination. The memory of this craft or of this artificial satellite serves for storing the information received until they are recovered and for retransmitting them to the reception station, on the ground for example.
