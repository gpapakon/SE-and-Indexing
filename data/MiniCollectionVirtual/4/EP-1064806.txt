<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD OF PHYSICAL RADIO CHANNEL POWER CONTROLFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to a method of physical channel power control in a radio system, the method comprising: establishing a physical channel with at least one spreading code; placing at least one service in the physical channel; performing physical channel power control according to the carrier/interference target set for the physical channel.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAccording to the prior art power control is performed on a physical channel on the basis of one carrier/interference target defined for it. In the prior art only one kind of service has been transferred on the physical channel at a time. If several different services are transferred simultaneously on the physical channel, e.g. user's speech, moving video images or data, problems arise because power control is not optimized as the channel conditions change. Each service has quality requirements of its own and different channel coding and interleaving solutions. At the beginning of establishment of a radio connection it is difficult to predict which would be a suitable carrier/interference target of power control and how the physical channel should be divided between different services. During the connection transmission power is controlled on the basis of the service which requires the highest transmission power on the physical channel in question. This wastes radio capacity of the system because use of a high transmission power causes interference to other physical radio channels.When the services use discontinuous transmission, the carrier/interference target of fast power control is maintained the same even though all services would not continuously use the resources of the physical channel. When only one carrier/interference target is defined for a physical channel, controlling of it is a very slow process. The reason for this is that in this case the target is based on a service requiring a very low error ratio, and thus defective frames are relatively infrequent at the receiving end.In the existing IS-95 system it is not known to transfer parallel services on one physical channel, in the broadband version of the IS-95 system, W-cdmaOne, the problem is solved by using parallel physical channels. Services that require a high transmission rate are transferred on separate additional channels, and a carrier/interference target is defined 

separately for each of them. The disadvantage of this solution is that power control has to be performed separately on each
