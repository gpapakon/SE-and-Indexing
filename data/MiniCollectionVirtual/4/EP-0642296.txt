<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for monitoring the lamp current of fluorescent tubes during operation at higher frequencies. It is known that the burning voltage (operating voltage, running voltage, maintaining voltage) of a fluorescent tube, during operation at 50 Hz, has voltage peaks which show that the tube must be restarted after each zero crossing. These restarting peaks are missing during operation at higher frequencies. In this case, the tube operates with the mostly sinusoidal burning voltage. It is furthermore known that fluorescent lamps have an unreliable starting behaviour at the end of their life and glow partly stochastically (randomly). This so-called flicker is regarded as disturbing, with the result that the corresponding tube must be replaced or switched off. With the invention, those states of the tube which inevitably lead to this flicker are recognised and the tube can be switched off automatically before this disturbing effect begins. Even during high-frequency (radio-frequency) operation, a used tube has a burning voltage curve which is not precisely sinusoidal. By detecting the associated burning current, unambiguous criteria can be determined for this state at the end of the life of the tube. In addition, too high a lamp current can be detected (recognised) as a further operating state which is damaging for the tube.
