<ABSTRACT>
Vertical/horizontal passenger conveyor system consisting of cars (1) provided with independent drive means for vertical and horizontal travel and of vertical and horizontal travel shafts (2, 3) which are equipped with fixed and movable guide means (5, 6) in which the drive means of the cars engage in a frictional and positive-locking manner, in which arrangement more than one car (1) can run in the same shaft at the same time. The drive means of the cars (1) are driven conveyor chains (4) with rollers and straps, the rollers gripping on steps in guides (5). The movable guides (6) have a pivoting mechanism (6.1) and a locking mechanism (6.2) in order to clear the path for horizontal travel in a horizontal shaft (3). For the horizontal travel there are guides (3.1) and deflection and tension rollers running on the guides (3.1).

Vertical-horizontal passenger-conveying system consisting 
of cages (1) provided with individual drive means for vertical 

and horizontal travel and vertical and horizontal travel 
shafts which are equipped with fixed and movable guide means 

(5, 6, 4.1, 4.2), into which the drive means can engage force-lockingly 
and shape-lockingly, wherein more than one cage (1) 

can travel in the same travel shaft at the same time, 
characterised thereby, that a cage (1) has at least one 

conveying chain (4), which serves for the vertical travel, 
with rollers (4.1) running up onto steps (5.1) of guide 

profiles (5, 6), guiding straps (4.2), at least one lower 
deflecting or tensioning roller (12, 11), which serves for the 

horizontal travel and runs on guides (3.1), and at least one 
retractable and extendable support (14, 17), which relieves 

the conveying chain (4). 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that a chain-tensioning and safety 

equipment is present, which consists of a compression spring 
(11.1), a tensioning roller (11), a switch cam (11.4), a 

switch contact (11.5), a safety circuit connection (11.6), a 
push-rod (11.2), a push-rod guide (11.7) and a brake shoe 

(11.3). 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that a chain drive is present, which 

consists of a motor (10), a reduction gear (9.1) and a chain 
wheel (9). 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1, 

characterised thereby, that a combined equipment for chain 
drive and chain-tensioning and safety is present, which 

consists of a motor sliding guide (18), a compression spring 
(19), a motor (10), a reduction gear (9.1), a push-rod (11.2) 

and a brake shoe (11.3).  
 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that the shaft base of an horizontal 

shaft (3) has retractable and extendable support plungers 
(17), which in engagement relieve the conveying chain (4) of 

the cage (1). 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that the cage (1) has drivable, 

retractable and extendable support rollers and runners (16), 
which are rotatable about the lifting axle. 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1, 
characterized thereby, that the steps (5.1) in guide profiles 

(5, 6) have a positive angle "a" to the horizontal "h" and 
that they are arranged at a spacing "X" one from the other, 

which is a multiple of the roller pitch. 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1 and 7, 
characterised thereby, that the guide profiles (6) have a 

pivoting mechanism (6.1) and a latching mechanism actuated 
thereby. 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1 and 7, 
characterized thereby, that the guide profiles (6) have a 

disconnecting place (6.4) and horizontal pivoting equipments 
(6.3) and that the lower horizontal pivoting equipment (6.3) 

has an internal lowering equipment. 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1 and 7, 
characterized thereby, that an upwardly pivotable guide 

profile (5.6) is present. 
Passenger-conveying system according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby, that the tensioning rollers (11) and 

the deflecting rollers (12) have respective lateral rims 
(11.1, 12.1), which roll along on vertical limbs of the guide 

profiles (3.1).
