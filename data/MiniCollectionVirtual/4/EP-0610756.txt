<ABSTRACT>
An activated membrane and method for preparing same are provided 
which comprises reacting an acceptor molecule prior to its attachment to 

the membrane with a protector molecule to form a complex. The complex 
is then attached to the membrane and the protector molecule 

subsequently removed. The membrane activated in this manner is used 
in a method for recovering a ligate from solution using affinity separation 

techniques. The immobilization or binding capacity is significantly 
increased with the membranes and methods disclosed herein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing activated membranes 
suitable for immobilizing ligate. The invention also relates to the 
activated membrane obtained by the method which is useful in affinity 
separation procedures. The invention further relates to a method for 
binding a mobile target ligate to a membrane surface having an immobilized 
ligand attached to it which is capable of reversible complex formation 
with the mobile target ligate. The term "affinity separation" is used to describe a process by which 
immunoglobulins, proteinaceous substances or other biologically active 
substances capable of biospecific complex formation are extracted from 
a fluid. Such substances are referred to herein as "ligates". A common 
procedure involves passing the fluid through a packed column containing 
a porous material, for example in the form of porous beads or a porous 
membrane, which has a covalently bound acceptor molecule capable of 
reversibly immobilizing the ligate through complex formation. The acceptor 
molecule will be the biospecific pair molecule to the above mentioned 
ligates. These molecules bound to the membrane surface are 
sometimes referred to herein as "ligands " or "ligand molecules" to distinguish 
them from ligates to be separated from solution. It is well-known, for example, that Protein A as the acceptor or ligand 
molecule binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulins of the class IgG at 
neutral pH values. Thus a porous membrane with Protein A bound to 
its surface can be used to separate IgG specifically from a fluid when it 
is passed through the membrane. The Protein A/IgG complex can be 
subsequently broken, providing a method for purification of IgG.  Despite advances in this technique a need exists for improved membrane 
materials and improved methods of separation. In view of the surface 
area of the porous materials involved, and the amount of acceptor 
molecule thought to be attached to the surfaces, a higher capacity of 
ligate separation might be expected than is presently found. One reason 
for the low separation capacity might be that the acceptor ligand molecules 
are not always attached to the membrane surface in a manner 
which allows them to react with and immobilize the ligate. It would 
therefore be highly desirable to develop improved membranes and methods 
of separation by which the amount of ligate separated per gram of 
porous membrane employed is enhanced. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a method for 
preparing an
