<ABSTRACT>
Especially for use in disinfecting water by bubbling 
in a gas such as ozone, novel apparatus comprises an inlet 

(1) and an outlet (2) for liquid and which defines a flow 
path therebetween, the path including, in succession, a 

downward flow zone (3,4) including a gas bubble inlet 
(9,10) and an upward flow zone (4,6), the adjacent downward 

and upward flow zones being separated by a wall (7,8) 
beneath which there is a gap (11,12) for the flow between 

the zones, wherein the gas bubble inlet is at a height of 
at least 50% of the height of the gap.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for improving 
gas/liquid contact, and to apparatus for use in such a 
method. Many systems are known, which involve gas/liquid 
contact, e.g. for the aerobic digestion of biomass, using 
oxygen or air, and for the disinfection of water, using 
chlorine or, increasingly, ozone. These systems are 
generally based on the principle of introducing bubbles of 
the gas into the liquid, e.g. in counter-current, with a 
view to maximising the degree of contact between the active 
gas and the liquid. A known ozone treatment tank comprises an inlet and an 
outlet for liquid and defines a flow path including, in 
succession, a downward flow or diffuser zone including a 
gas bubble inlet and an upward flow or decay zone, the 
zones being separated by a wall beneath which there is a 
gap for the flow between these zones. In conventional such 
systems, the bubble diffuser or other gas inlet has been 
positioned at the base of the diffuser zone. It has now been discovered that the efficiency of 
gas/liquid contact can be improved, with consequent savings 
in the cost of expensive materials such as ozone, if 
apparatus of the type described above is modified such that 
the gas bubble inlet in the diffuser zone is at a height of 
at least 50% of the height of the gap separating the 
diffuser and decay zones. Without wishing to be bound by 
theory, it is believed that the improved results are the 
result of ensuring that a reduced proportion of gas bubbles 
are diverted by the liquid flow into the decay zone, where 
they pass in co-current with the liquid and may even 
increase the flow rate there. Increased flow rate in the 
decay zone is undesirable, because that zone is adapted to 
allow all disinfectant to mix with the liquid before the 
latter passes through the outlet of the apparatus.  In simple terms, the present invention depends upon 
raising the gas diffuser or other inlet above the floor of 
the diffuser zone. The diffuser is preferably raised to 
within 10 or 25% of the height of the gap, and is most 
preferably at about the height of the gap. It may be 
raised further, and this may indeed encourage greater 
gas/liquid contact; however, this is at the expense of a 
decreased height of the effective diffuser zone, for a 
given apparatus. In a typical example, the height of each zone is about 
6 m, and the height of the gap up to 1 m. There may be any 
number of combinations of contact and decay zones. 
Usually, the last decay zone will be relatively large, in 
order to
