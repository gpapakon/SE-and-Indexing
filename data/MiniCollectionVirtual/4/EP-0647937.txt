<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to binders for magnetic media
and in particular to a binder which comprises a blend of
a particular phosphonate functional polyurethane and a
hard resin.Magnetic recording is the preferred method of
information storage when data must be capable of being
read immediately after writing (eg in instant replay or
for verification), or where the data is to be processed
by a machine.The recording medium usually consists of fine,
single domain particles dispersed in a polymeric binder,
coated onto a substrate. The desired physical and
magnetic properties of the recording layer are often
dictated by certain processing parameters. One of these,
good pigment wetting is important when ensuring an even
distribution of pigment throughout the finished magnetic
coating. Good pigment wetting is obtained by selecting
suitable dispersing agents whose role is to interact
strongly with the pigment surface and to provide
stability to the magnetic particles once dispersed. This
ensures that the formed dispersion has a prolonged
lifetime and that resultant magnetic layer formed from
the dispersion has the required physical and magnetic
properties.In general, most dispersions for forming the
recording medium contain pigment, binder resins,
lubricants and dispersing agents. Of the various resins
utilised for magnetic media applications, the most useful
are polyurethane resins, vinyl chloride - vinyl acetate
copolymers and nitrocellulose and the like. These binder
materials are not able to efficiently wet the pigment
surface, and so cannot disperse the magnetic particle 
sufficiently well to enable a medium to be produced with
homogeneously dispersed magnetic particles. In such
systems it is conventional to add a lower molecular
weight dispersing agent such as a soy-bean lecithin or a
phosphoric acid derivative to aid in pigment dispersion.
Magnetic media containing low molecular weight dispersing
agents are prone to interactions which can adversely
affect its performance. When such a system is used over
a long period of time bleeding of the dispersant can
occur which will be detrimental to the durability of the
media. In addition the current trend is to use media
which have high pigment loadings (typically greater than
75% by weight), of fine (i.e. high surface area)
pigments. Such media require high levels of dispersant
and consequently proportionally lower levels of binder.
This has an adverse effect on the physical properties of
the media.In order to overcome such problems, binders having
dispersing
