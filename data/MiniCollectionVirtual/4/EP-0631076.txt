<ABSTRACT>
Solenoid (electromagnetic) valve including an electromagnetic coil (6) wound on the hub of a plastic bobbin (former) (5), a central metallic core plunger (10) located within the hub (7) of the bobbin, the said core plunger forming an axial passage, and an armature (15) capable of being moved by the electromagnetic forces axially in the direction of one end of the said axial duct with a view to causing gas to flow through the said duct. For this purpose a screw thread (11) is formed on the external surface of the core plunger in order to interact with the internal surface of the said hub with a view to adjusting the axial position of the core plunger relative to the armature.

Electromagnetic valve consisting of an electromagnetic coil (6)
wound on the hub of a reel (5) of plastic material, a central metallic core (10)

located in the hub (7) of the reel, the said core forming an axial conduit and
an armature (15) susceptible to being axially displaced by the

electromagnetic forces in the direction of one extremity of the axial conduit
with a view to controlling the flow of gas in that conduit, a thread (11) having

been formed on the external surface of the core with a view to regulating the
axial position of the core in relation to the armature, characterised by the fact

that the aforementioned thread works together with the interior surface of the
aforementioned hub, the reel being moulded on to the core.
Electromagnetic valve in accordance with claim 1, in which the core
is equipped with means (13) permitting its rotation in relation to the reel

forme the exterior of the electromagnetic valve.
Electromagnetic valve in accordance with claims 1 and 2,
consisting of a magnetic circuit (3) with a flux return circuit in the form of a U,

the aforementioned armature being arranged to position itself between the
branches of the U.
Procedure of manufacture and control of an electromagnetic valve
consisting of an electromagnetic coil (6) wound on the hub of a reel (5) of

plastic material, a central metallic core (10) located in the hub (7) of the reel,
the said core (10) forming an axial conduit and possessing a thread (11) on

its external surface and an armature (15) susceptible to being axially
displaced by the electromagnetic forces in the direction of an extremity of the

axial conduit with a view to controlling the flow of gas in that conduit,
characterised by the fact that it includes stages consisting of :


moulding the aforementioned reel (5) on the core (10) in a way that
the plastic material of the reel adheres to the external surface of the core in

penetrating into the aforementioned thread.
the assembly of the electromagnetic valve.
breaking the connection between the reel and the core by turning the
core around its axis in relation to the reel.
the control of the actual position of the core in accordance with its
movement of rotation.
