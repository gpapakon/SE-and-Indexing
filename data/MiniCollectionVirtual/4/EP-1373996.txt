<DESCRIPTION>
MANUFACTURING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROCESSING MATERIALSField of the InventionThe present invention generally relates to factories having a high automation level, and more particularly to a manufacturing system and a method for processing materials .Background of the InventionTo meet the automation challenges for example within a semiconductor factory, large computer integrated manufacturing (CI ) systems and legacy infrastructure have been developed. In manufacturing facilities in accordance with the prior art, CIM systems can for example support the following functions: tracking material flow through the factory, recording factory worker comments and/or relevant data pertaining to the products being manufactured, dispatching of material (in a semiconductor factory for example wafer lots) , and scheduling and transportation of material within the factory.A disadvantage of the factories and the manufacturing systems in accordance with the" prior art is, for example, that factory employees must interact with the CIM host system prior to performing any operation on material. A further disadvantage is that the host system must be maintained and upgraded either through expensive external contracts with software suppliers or through expensive internal development . 

 Brief Description of the DrawingsFIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing a manufactur- ing system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; andFIG. 2 is a flow chart showing an example for a direct information exchange between means assigned to a material to be processed and processing tools and for de- ciding which of the processing tools is supposed to process a respective material.Detailed Description of a Preferred EmbodimentIn accordance with the present invention a manufacturing system is provided, comprising: materials 110, 120 to be processed, and processing tools 130, 140, 150 for processing said materials 110, 120, wherein to each of said materials 110, 120 there are assigned means 111, 121 for directly exchanging information with said processing tools 130, 140, 150 and for deciding on the basis of said directly exchanged information which of said processing tools 130, 140, 150 is supposed to process a respective material 110, 120. In accordance with the present invention there is further provided a method for processing materials, said method comprising the following steps: a) providing materials 110, 120 to be processed, b) providing processing tools 130, 140, 150 for proc- essing said materials 110, 120,
