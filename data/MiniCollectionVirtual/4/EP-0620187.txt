<ABSTRACT>
Process for the removal of sulfur oxides from 
sulfur oxide-containing gas with simultaneous production 

of ammonium sulfate. The process is carried out by 
first passing hot sulfur oxide-containing gas through a 

prescrubber wherein the gas contacts saturated aqueous 
ammonium sulfate liquor which is recycled in the 

prescrubber (10), followed by passing the prescrubbed gas 
through an absorber (40) wherein the prescrubbed gas contacts 

dilute aqueous ammonium sulfate liquor. The sulfur 
oxide in the sulfur oxide-containing gas is absorbed by 

the dilute aqueous ammonium sulfate liquor (48) in the 
absorber, and scrubbed gas is removed from the absorber. 

The dilute aqueous ammonium sulfate liquor is treated 
with ammonia (58) and air (82) and the absorbed sulfur dioxide is 

converted to ammonium sulfate in the liquor. The dilute 
ammonium sulfate liquor is recycled into contact with 

the prescrubbed gas in the absorber. Dilute aqueous 
ammonium sulfate liquor is removed from the absorber and 

added to the saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate liquor (34) 
in the prescrubber where it becomes saturated due to 

evaporation caused by the hot gas. Ammonium sulfate 
crystals form in the saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate 

liquor in the prescrubber are recovered as product (126) from 
saturated aqueous ammonium s
ulfate withdrawn from the 
prescrubber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
process for the removal of sulfur oxides from sulfur 
oxide-containing gases, and more particularly, to an 
improved process for the simultaneous absorption of 
sulfur dioxide and production of ammonium sulfate from 
gas containing sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide emission control from such sources 
as fossil fuel fired boilers, smelters, sulfuric acid 
plants, pulp and paper mill operations and the like is 
required by law in many countries to mitigate the 
serious environmental and health damage that is 
associated with sulfur dioxide. The most widely 
practiced method for sulfur dioxide control is based 
upon limestone or lime contact with flue gases in the 
form of aqueous slurry. In most instances, the byproduct 
is either discarded as a land fill or converted 
into gypsum for use in wall board and cement 
manufacture. In a few instances, other alkaline 
reagents, such as sodium compounds, magnesium compounds 
and ammonia have been used with recovery of useful byproducts, 
such as pure sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid and 
sulfur. Ammonia and ammoniacal scrubbing solutions are also 
well known for flue gas desulfurization. In U.S. Patent 
No. 4,690,807, which is incorporated herein by reference 
in its entirety, gases containing at least one sulfur 
oxide are treated with aqueous ammonia, and ammonium 
sulfate is produced in a single vessel which includes an 
absorption tower and liquor reservoir. The sulfur oxide 
gas or gases are removed from gases containing sulfur 
oxides by contact of the gas with an aqueous solution of 
ammonium sulfate. As the sulfur oxide gas, such as 
sulfur dioxide, is absorbed by the ammonium sulfate  
 
solution, it becomes acidic. The acidic solution in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,690,807 is neutralized by injection of 
ammonia into the ammonium sulfate solution to maintain a 
desired pH level sufficient to prevent excessive ammonia 
loss. An oxidizing medium, such as air, is injected 
into the neutralized ammonium sulfate solution 
containing the absorbed sulfur oxide gas, leading to the 
formation of ammonium sulfate. The ammonium sulfate 
product can be withdrawn as a suspension of ammonium 
sulfate crystals, as a saturated solution and/or as a 
less-than-saturated solution. In U.S. Patent No. 
4,690,807, recovered ammonium sulfate can be further 
recrystallized and/or dewatered and dried for ease of 
handling and storage. It is generally known that in processes dependent 
on oxidation rate, the higher the oxidation rate, the 
more

saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate liquor in a prescrubber vessel (12) to 

evaporate water by adiabatically cooling the gas, to produce a saturated 
aqueous ammonium sulfate liquor having ammonium sulfate crystals 

suspended therein, and to produce a prescrubbed gas containing sulfur 
oxide and water vapor;
