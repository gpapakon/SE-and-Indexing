 METHOD FOR AIDING MICROBIAL DEGRADATION OF SPILLED OILBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field Of the InventionThis invention generally relates to methods of cleaning up oil spills from natural bodies of water such as oceans, seas, lakes, harbors and rivers. More specifically, this invention relates to methods for flocculating and/or agglomerating spilled oil associated with a natural body of water, such as a floating layer or film of oil and/or dispersed oil droplets, emulsions, etc., in order to facilitate its subsequent degradation through the use of micro¬ organisms which are capable of using the spilled oil as a nutrient source.2. Prior ArtOil pollution of natural bodies of water, and especially of the ocean, has caused extensive environmental problems and ever mounting public concern. Such pollution has been caused by illegal 

dumping, accidents, warfare and leakage from oil drilling operations in continental shelf regions. Regardless of their cause, however, oil spills invariably produce extensive ecological and/or economic damage by destroying or tainting many forms of aquatic life and by fouling water intakes, recreational beaches, boats, fishing gear, harbor installations and the like.Unfortunately, oil cleanup operations are both physically and technically difficult; they normally involve one or more of the following measures: (1) physical removal of the oil from the water, with or without the use of adsorbents, (2) dispersion of the oil through the use of detergents, (3) "sinking" the spilled oil, (4) burning floating oil slicks and (5) using microorganisms which digest the spilled oil and thereby eliminate it. Each of these measures has its own set of special environmental and technical considerations. Physical removal (e.g. , by "skimming" or pumping operations) is of course the most ecologically desirable remedy but, using existing technologies, it is feasible only under nearly ideal weather, water turbulence and response time conditions. Generally speaking, seas higher than about 1-2 feet, currents in excess of 2-3 knots and/or the passage of a few day's time usually makes physical removal operations largely ineffective and extremely costly.Dispersion of spilled oil through the use of detergents can be accomplished much more quickly, but this technology has several detrimental side effects. For example, the detergents normally employed to disperse spilled oil are very often toxic to aquatic life in their own right. Moreover, their use also 

tends to bring the spilled oil into more intimate
