<ABSTRACT>
A grind-machining method of ceramic materials 
characterized in that a peripheral speed of a grinding 

wheel relative to a working surface is set to 50 to 
300 m/sec, a feed stroke speed of the working surface 

of the grinding wheel in a working direction is set to 
50 to 200 m/min, and preferably, a down-feed speed (V₃) 

of the working surface of the grinding wheel in a 
direction orthogonal to the surface of the workpiece 

is set to 0.05 to 3 mm/min. The grind-machining 
method of ceramic materials can reduce a grinding 

force at the time of grinding of ceramic materials and 
residual defects due to machining, and at the same 

time, can accomplish high machining efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surface grinding
method for machining ceramic materials
using
a grinding wheel.
Such a method is known, for example, from EP-A-0 315 711.Ceramic materials generally have excellent
mechanical properties in hardness, strength and heat-resistance
or the like, and their application as
mechanical structural materials is expected. However,
since the ceramic materials are typical hard and
brittle materials, various problems remain unsolved in
the aspect of the selection of machining methods for
providing necessary geometric shapes for final
products, strength or fatigue life after machining.Grind-machining by diamond wheels has gained the
widest application at present as a machining method of
ceramic materials. Grind-machining using the diamond
wheels is an excellent machining method in the aspects
of versatility of machining equipment andof machining
cost. Because the ceramic materials are the hard and
brittle materials as described above, however, damages
such as cracks or defects remain on the machined
surface, resulting in the drop of the strength, life
or reliability and preventing in most cases the
practical application of the machined products. It is known, for example, that the depth of
cracks introduced at the time of grinding is affected
by the grain size of the diamond grains and is as
great as 20 to 40 µm in the case of a silicon nitride
material (Yoshikawa, "FC Report", Vol. 8, No. 5, p.
148 (1990)). The order of this crack depth is
believed to be a fatal defect for practical mechanical
components.It is reported that a correlationship exists
between the surface roughness of the ground surface of
the silicon nitride material and its flexural
strength, and the surface coarseness must be limited
to below 1 µm so as to maintain reliability of the
strength (Itoh, "The Latest Fine Ceramics Technique",
edited by Kogyo Chosakai, p. 219, (1983)).Accordingly, there is the case where the method
of securing reliability of the strength must be
employed by grinding the surface layer, where defects
remain, by free grains, such as lapping or polishing
after grinding by diamond wheels to remove any
defects. However, such an additional grinding work is
extremely disadvantageous economically.From the aspect of machining efficiency, on the
other hand, it is known that machining efficiency can
be drastically improved by adding a machining pressure
above critical value in the grinding work of ceramic
materials (Tomimori, "FC Report", Vol. 1, No. 8, p. 5
(1983)). However, experimental
