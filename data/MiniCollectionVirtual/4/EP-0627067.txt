<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a priming and self-destruction system for ammunition having an intrinsic spin motion about an axis. The self-destruction system comprises on the one hand a trigger (40, 140) mounted to pivot about an axis (41, 141) parallel to the rotation axis of the ammunition, the trigger being movable by the effect of the centrifugal force against the action of a return spring (42, 142), and on the other hand a means for maintaining a secondary firing pin (30, 130) with its own spring in an armed position, said means being controlled by the trigger (40, 140) when the system rotates about the axis of the ammunition, and released thereby when the rotation motion of the ammunition stops, the secondary firing pin (30, 130) then causing radial striking of a priming means (12, 112). The invention applies particularly to ammunition ejected from a cargo shell.

<CLAIMS>
Priming and self-destruction system for a munition 
(1), in particular a sub-munition having its own 

rotational movement around an axis and intended to be 
ejected from a cargo shell, and incorporating a priming 

means (12, 112) carried by a mobile slide (13, 113) from a 
safety position to an armed position, a main firing pin 

(22, 122) to ignite the priming means and a secondary 
self-destruction firing pin (30, 130) armed by a spring, 

the self-destruction part comprising a centrifugal sear 
(40,140) mounted pivoting around a spindle (41,141) 

roughly parallel to the rotational axis of the munition, a 
sear which is mobile under the effect of the centrifugal 

force against the action of a return spring (42,142), a 
holding means for the secondary firing pin (30, 130) with 

its own spring in an armed position, a means controlled by 
the sear (40,140) when the system is rotating around the 

axis of the munition, the holding means being released by 
the sear when the munition stops rotating, for example 

after impact of the munition on the ground, characterized 
in that the centrifugal sear (40, 140) changes position 

further to the springing back of its return spring 
(42,142), the secondary firing pin (30,130) thereafter 

causing the radial percussion of the priming means 
(12,112) through an opening (15c, 115c) of the slide 

(13,113). 
A system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the holding means are formed by a finger (43,143) 

integral with the sear and fitted to one of its ends, the 
finger cooperating with a circular groove (37,137) 

arranged in a part of the secondary firing pin (30,130) in 
such a way as to hold it by its spring (36,136) in the 

armed position, when the return spring (42,142) of the 
sear (40,140) is compressed and to release it when the 

sear, pushed by its return spring, has adopted the firing 
position.  

 
A system according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that it comprises means to hold the secondary firing pin 

(30, 130) with its spring (36,136) in the armed position 
when the slide is in the safety position. 
A system according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that, when it is in the safety position, the secondary 

firing pin (30) is held in the armed position by the slide 
(13) against which it presses. 
A system according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that, when it is in the safety position, the secondary 

firing pin (30,130) is held in the armed position by the 
sear finger (43,143), the latter being held by part of the 

slide (13,113) in a position such that it compresses its 
own return spring (42,142). 
A system according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the slide is a valve (13) able to translate from its 

safety position to its armed position, and fitted with a 
spur point (47) on which the sear (40) presses when the 

slide (13) is in the safety position. 
A system according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the sear (40) is equipped with a notch (45) 

intended to accommodate a stop (46) which protrudes from a 
side face of the slide (13), after impact of the munition 

(1) on the ground, to prevent the slide (13) from moving 

into its armed position. 
A system according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the slide is made in the form of a shutter (113) 

mounted turning around a spindle (159) parallel to the 
axis of the munition, and in that the shutter carries a 

lip (165) against which the end of the sear (140) comes to 
rest. 
A system according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the end (164) of the sear (140) constitutes a lock 

preventing the shutter (113) from rotating. 
A system according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the secondary firing pin (30,130) is 

constituted by a hollow part (33,133) closed at one end by  
 

a bottom wall (34,134) prolonged on the outside by a 
percussion tip (30a, 130a) and closed at the other end by 

a closing plate (36,136) fixed to the casing (5,105), the 
arming spring (31,131) of the secondary firing pin being 

housed inside the said part (33,133). 
A system according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the secondary firing pin (30) is integral with the 

sear (40), the spring of the secondary firing pin being 
constituted by the return spring of the sear.
