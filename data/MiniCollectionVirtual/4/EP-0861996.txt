<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for converting a rotary motion into a linear motion which has three balls (6-1, 6-2, 6-3) held at equiangular positions on
the same circle by a ball retainer (8) between a ball rolling surface (4a) formed in an annular fixed plate (4) and a ball pressing surface (3a)

formed at the end of a linear motion shaft (3) that can be linearly reciprocated. These balls are retained in place by a coil spring (9). The ball
retainer (8) rotates with a rotary input shaft (2). The ball rolling surface (4a) is formed with three undulated cam surfaces along the

circumferential direction, so that as the balls (6) held in the ball retainer rotate with the rotary input shaft (2), the balls reciprocate in the
direction of the axis line L causing the linear motion shaft (3) to perform a reciprocal linear motion in the direction of the axis line L.

Compared with a conversion mechanism comprising a screw and a nut, this conversion device has a small dead band and can easily be
reduced in size.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a conversion device for converting a
rotary motion into a linear motion.As a mechanism for converting a rotary motion into a linear
motion, one has generally been used that is provided with a combination of
a screw and a nut, and similar mechanisms have also been used. In a
conventional mechanism, for example, a ball thread is rotated by a motor
or other means while a ball nut engaging with the thread is retained not to
rotate, whereby rotation of the ball thread causes to occur a linear motion
of the ball nut along its axis line. Thus, the ball nut can be moved
reciprocally and nearly at a desired stroke by controlling direction and
amount of rotation of the ball thread.A generally used conversion device for converting a rotary
motion into a liner motion must be provided with a rotation-preventing
means for retaining one of the screw and nut not to rotate in order to
convert a rotary motion into a liner motion. It also must be provided with a
mechanical mechanism or control means for defining the stroke of a
member that is moved reciprocally and linearly. Further, a retaining
mechanism must be provided for supporting a rotary shaft formed with a
screw. Accordingly, it is generally difficult to reduce in size of the
conversion mechanism provided with a combination of a screw and a nut
for converting a rotary motion into a linear motion. If the mechanism is
reduced in size, there will occur disadvantages including that a dead band
thereof becomes large.In view of the above points, an object of this invention is to
realize a conversion device for converting a rotary motion into a linear
motion that can easily be reduced in size.In order to solve the above object, a conversion device for
converting a rotary motion into a linear motion according to this invention is
characterized in that: it comprises a rotary shaft; a linear motion shaft
capable of being moved reciprocally and linearly and arranged coaxially
with the rotary shaft; a circular plate arranged concentrically with the rotary
shaft; a ball rolling surface formed on a surface of the circular plate; a ball
pressing surface formed on the linear motion shaft so as to face the ball
pressing surface; a plurality of balls arranged between the ball rolling
surface and the ball pressing surface; a spring member for resiliently
pressing the ball pressing surface of the linear motion shaft toward the
balls; a ball retainer for retaining the respective balls in place along a
circumferential direction, wherein the ball rolling
