<ABSTRACT>
A transmission coupling for manipulator head includes 
a support body (50) connected to the manipulator head (4), 

an intermediate transmission member (76) slidable on the 
support body (50) along a first line (C), and an attachment 

member (28) slidable on the intermediate member (76) along 
a second line (B)perpendicular to the first line. The 

attachment member can pivot relative to the support body 
(50) about at least two mutually-perpendicular axes 

substantially parallel to the plane defined by the first 
and second lines. The present invention also relates to a 

rapid attachment device for an interchangeable tool for a 
manipulator head (104) include a base body (106) connected 

to the manipulator head and generating means for providing 
a force for retaining the tool (102). The base body and 

the tool have respective cooperating abutment surfaces 
which are kept in contact as a result of the force exerted 

by the generating means and are adapted to establish the 
position of the tool relative to the head along a first 

line of constraint. Constraining members (118,120) are 
provided for constraining the two degrees of freedom of 

the tool in a plane substantially perpendicular to the 
first line of constraint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rapid attachment device for
an interchangeable tool for a manipulator head of the type
defined in the preamble of claim 1.
Such an attachment device is described for example in GB-A-2120634The present invention has been developed with
particular regard to a manipulator device for pieces of
sheet metal of the type forming the subject of the
following applications, all of which are based on Italian
Patent Application Nos. 67703-A/89 and 67704-A/89 both
filed on August 16, 1989.
Japanese Patent Application No. 2-216462 U.S. Patent Application No. 07/567,727 U.K. Patent application No. 9017741.1 German Patent Application No. P4025988.9French Patent Application No. 9010392Korean Patent Application No. 90-12769Swedish Patent Application No. 9002675-8Chinese Patent Application No. 79108086Swiss Patent Application No. 2656/90Austrian Patent Application No. A 1698/90
Figure 1 and 2 schematically show a part of these
applications. In Figures 1 and 2, two motor-driven
manipulator heads indicated 2 and 4 are provided with
respective attachment members 6, 8 rotatable on the heads
2, 4 about respective axes A, A'. In Figure 1, respective 
gripping tools 10, 12 are fixed to the attachment members
6, 8 for gripping a metal sheet 14. In a different
configuration of use, the attachment members 6, 8 are
connected to an operating equipment 16.As a result of working tolerances, the axes of
rotation A, A' of the heads 2, 4 may not be exactly
coincident. In Figures 1 and 2, the error in the
alignment of the axes has been exaggerated in order to
facilitate understanding of the problem. Observation of
Figures 1 and 2 makes it clear that the error in alignment
of the axes A, A' causes considerable problems in the
taking up of the sheet 14 or the equipment 16. This error
causes further problems when the two attachment members
are to contribute equally to the transmission of driving
torque to the equipment 16.The problem of the relative errors in the
geometry of the manipulator heads also exists in the more
general case of a manipulator device having a single head
to which any operating tool is connected.The above-mentioned applications describe a device
for gripping metal sheet in which the interchangeable tool
is constituted by a plate for picking up metal sheets and
having a seat in which a base body carried by the head of
a manipulator device is inserted. The force which retains
the plate is generated by permanent magnets carried by the
base body. The position of the plate relative to the
