<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with a method and in an apparatus (1) for cleaning long tubes (21) the cleaning process is effected during transverse advancement of the tubes by means of a drum-shaped, rotatable conveyor (12) from an inlet positioned at one lengthwise side wall (6) of the apparatus (1) to an outlet positioned on the opposite lengthwise side wall (7) via a cleaning zone (25) containing a flushing unit (27) arranged to flush a cleaning fluid (11) at a high pressure and in a large flow about and through the tubes (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns a method and an
apparatus for cleaning elongate objects, such as tubes,
preferably metal tubes, as exemplified by US-A-3103939.Following manufacture and severing of tubes to the
desired lengths, 2 - 6 meters, for instance, the tubes
must be cleaned before use to remove dirt, such as oil and
grease. Generally, the tubes are immerged into hot
cleaning baths or apparatuses known as trichloroethylene
apparatuses. These methods are inconvenient, time-consuming
and do not produce the desired result,
particularly as regards removal of chips, grindings and
so called rolling dust. Trichloroethylene apparatuses
cause other problems as well, especially to the
environment, and are becoming obsolete.In other cases goods of elongate shape are cleaned
lengthwise, in tunnel cleaners. From the point of view of
washing efficiency such cleaners are satisfactory but they
require considerable floor space and their capacity is
comparatively low. This cleaning method does not either
lend itself to internal cleaning of the tubes.Mechanical cutting of the elongate objects normally
precedes the cleaning thereof. The rapid development of
automatic cutting machines in later years has increased
the demands for cleaning installations having higher
capacities than those afforded by the methods outlined
above.The object of the invention is to suggest a method
and an apparatus allowing efficient, rapid and space-saving
cleaning of elongate objects as described above.This object is met by a method according to
claim 1 and an apparatus according to claim 2. The invention will be described in closer detail in
the following with reference to the accompanying drawing
figures illustrating a presently preferred embodiment of
the cleaning apparatus and wherein,
Fig. 1 illustrates the apparatus schematically in a
perspective view obliquely from above, certain parts
having been cut away in order to illustrate components
behind,Fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view through the
apparatus in Fig. 1,Fig. 3 is a transverse sectional view through a part
of the apparatus along line III-III of Fig. 2, andFig. 4 likewise is a transverse sectional view
through the apparatus, in this case along line IV-IV of
Fig. 2.The cleaning apparatus
1, is an elongate
frame construction erected from frame profile members 2
and covering sheet-metal plates 3 not described herein in
detail, and comprising a bottom 4, a top wall 5, front and
rear side walls 6 and 7 and end walls 8. The interior of the apparatus 1 contains a preferably

<CLAIMS>
A method of cleaning elongate objects, such as
tubes, according to which method the elongate objects are

introduced into a cleaning apparatus, are cleaned with a
cleaning liquid in said apparatus and after cleaning they

are removed from the apparatus the elongate objects being
advanced transversely inside the cleaning apparatus while

being flushed internally and externally by the cleaning
liquid, 
characterised
 in that the elongate
objects are advanced resting in pockets (24), closed

during flushing, through which pockets the cleaning
liquid is allowed to flow at a high pressure and in a

large flow.
An apparatus for cleaning elongate objects (21),
such as tubes, said apparatus (1) having an inlet (22)

for introduction of the dirty elongate objects (21), a
container (9) holding the liquid (11) for cleaning the

elongate objects (21), and an outlet (23) for removal of
the elongate objects, after cleaning thereof,

a conveyor (12) arranged to advance
the elongate objects (21) transversely from the inlet

(23) positioned on one of the lengthwise side walls (6)
of the apparatus (1) to the outlet (23) on the opposite

side wall (7) thereof, and a cleaning zone (25) 
characterised
 by
said cleaning zone (25) including

a flushing unit (27) which flushes the cleaning liquid
(11) at a high pressure and in a large flow about and

through the elongate objects (21) during at least a part
of the advancement thereof from the inlet (22) to the

outlet (23), the conveyor having pockets (24) for
reception of the elongate objects (21) and means (36)

being provided for closing of the pockets (24) in the
cleaning zone (25), such that the cleaning liquid (11),

while flushing the elongate objects (21), is allowed to
flow through the closed pockets from the one end thereof

to the other so as to flush the elongate objects
internally as well as externally. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised

in that the conveyor (12) is a drum (13)
which is rotatably mounted inside the container (9) and

in the periphery of which are formed the pockets (24) for
reception in succession of the elongate objects (21)

transversely during the rotation of the drum from the
inlet (22) and subsequent displacement of the elongate

objects past the cleaning zone (25) and from there to the
outlet (23) so as to deliver the washed objects to said

outlet.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised

in that the drum (13) is arranged to
rotate continuously or intermittently about a centre

shaft (17) extending at a slight angle to the horizontal
plane, in that the pockets (24), which are distributed

around the circumference (26) of the drum (13), extend
along essentially the entire length thereof, and in that

the cleaning zone (25) is located within the upper half
of the drum (13).
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 2-4,

characterised
 in that the flushing unit (27)
is formed with flushing nozzles (34) opening into the

closed pockets (24).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, 
characterised

in that the flushing unit (27) is in the
form of a distributor box (28) having an inlet (29) which

is connected to the pressure side of a pump (31), the
suction side of which is connected to the container (9)

below the level (10) of the cleaning liquid therein, and
in that the flushing nozzles (34) are mounted in outlets

(33) in the distributor box (28).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised

in that the distributor box (28) is
arranged in the area of the higher-level end (14) of the

drum and in that the flushing nozzles (34) flush in the
lengthwise direction of the pockets (24) and thus in that

of the elongate objects (21). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 5-7,

characterised
 in that one or several of the
flushing nozzles (34) positioned at the starting end of

the cleaning zone (25) as seen in the direction of
rotation (A) of the drum (13) emit a larger flow of

cleaning liquid than do the subsequent nozzles in order
to successively fill the pockets (24) with flushing

cleaning liquid (11) as rapidly as possible.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3-8,

characterised
 in that the pockets (24) are
open outwards and are delimited laterally by follower

members (35) arranged on the circumference (26) of the
drum (13) and directed obliquely outwards, in that in the

area of the cleaning zone (25) the pockets (24) are
covered outwardly by a covering means (36), closing the

pockets (24) in the cleaning zone outwards and laterally,
and in that the flushing nozzles (34) are arranged at the

higher-level end (14) of the drum (13) so as to allow the
cleaning liquid (11) to flow from that end to outlets

(40) positioned at the lower-level end (15) thereof and
further down into the container (9) to be cleaned and re-circulated.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 9, 
characterised

in that the covering means (36) is
formed from a screen (37) of a water-tight and pliable

material which is arranged so as to extend across
essentially the upper half of the drum (13), said screen

(37) abutting yieldingly and tightly against the outer
free ends (39) of the follower members (35) under the

influence of a predetermined pre-stress force.
