<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to reduction of 
temperatures in various portions of an electric motor and 

improvement of duration of vibration damping effect of a 
rubber vibration isolator (7). As shown in Fig. 1, vent 

holes (6a, 7a) are provided in a bracket (6) and the 
rubber vibration isolators (7). A vent passage (8) is 

provided at opposing surface of the rubber vibration 
isolator, which vent passage consists of a space along 

which air can flow. A heat resistance life of the 
electric motor is prolonged and a duration of vibration 

damping effect of the rubber vibration isolator is 
improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric 
motor, and more particularly to an electric motor in 
which vent holes are provided in a bracket and a rubber 
vibration isolator, so that the temperatures at various 
portions of the electric motor, such as motor coils and 
bearing portions, are reduced, and the temperatures of 
the rubber vibration isolators are reduced to suppress 
thermal hardening of the rubber, thereby improving the 
duration of the vibration transmission prevention effect 
in the electric motor. The upper limits of the temperature rise in 
various portions of an electric motor are prescribed with 
regulations, and it is required to suppress a thermal 
hardening of the rubber vibration isolator so that a 
durability of vibration transmission prevention effect in 
the electric motor is kept. Therefore, it is required to 
further reduce the temperature. The countermeasures are disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. 63-99739 and 2-142337. Namely, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 
No. 63-99739 discloses that two types of windows, one for 
suction and the other for discharge, are provided in an 
end bracket so as to reduce the temperature of the bearing 
portion. It can be considered that the temperature  
 
reduction in the bearing portion causes to reduce a 
thermal transmission to the rubber vibration isolator. 
However, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 
63-99739 does not refer to such effect. Japanese Patent 
Laid-open Publication No. 2-142337 discloses that a 
bracket is so disposed that a side surface of the bracket 
is not in contact with a side surface of the rubber 
vibration isolator opposing the bracket side surface, but 
does not refer to the durability of vibration isolation 
effect and the temperature reduction. Thus, no proposals has been made as to counter-measures 
for reducing temperatures at various portions of 
an electric motor and for improving a durability of 
vibration damping effect by means of suppressing thermal 
hardening of the rubber vibration isolator. The problems are left unsolved by the prior 
arts, such as the reduction of temperatures in various 
portions of an electric motor and the improvement in 
durability of vibration damping effect by means of 
suppressing thermal hardening of the rubber vibration 
isolator. Accordingly, an object of the present 
invention is to solve these problems. In order to solve the above-described problems, 
according to the present invention, there is provided a resin molded electric motor
