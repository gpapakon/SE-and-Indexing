<ABSTRACT>
Process for the surface treatment by a dry route of at least one portion of metal surface (1), according to which the portion is treated at a pressure close to atmospheric pressure with a gaseous treatment atmosphere including excited or unstable species and being substantially devoid of electrically charged species, which is obtained from a primary gas mixture (8) and, if appropriate, from an adjacent gas mixture (9, 10), the primary gas mixture being obtained at the gas exit (6) of at least one apparatus (4) for forming excited or unstable gaseous species, in which an initial gas mixture (7) including an inert gas and/or a reducing gas and/or an oxidising gas has been converted, the adjacent mixture not having passed through the apparatus.

Process for the dry surface preparation of at
least one metal surface portion with the aim of

performing one or more of the following functions on
the said metal surface: cleaning, degreasing, surface

activation,

   characterized in that the portion is treated,
at a pressure close to atmospheric pressure, by a

gaseous treatment atmosphere comprising excited or
unstable species and substantially devoid of

electrically charged species, obtained from:

a primary gaseous mixture (8), which is
obtained at the gas outlet (6) of at least one device

(4) for the production of excited or unstable gaseous
species, in which an initial gaseous mixture (7)

comprising an inert gas and/or a reducing gas and/or an
oxidizing gas has been converted by electric discharge;

and
from an adjacent gaseous mixture (9, 10) not
having passed through the said device (4).
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the adjacent gaseous mixture is a reducing

mixture.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the adjacent gaseous mixture contains

silane SiH
4
.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the component including the metal 

portion to be treated is brought to a temperature of no
more than 600°C.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the component (1) including the

metal portion to be treated is brought opposite the gas
outlet (6) of the said device (4), if necessary

opposite the gas outlets of a plurality of devices
arranged in parallel over the width of the component

and/or successively opposite the gas outlets of a
plurality of devices (11, 4, 12) arranged in series, by

a conveying system (2) traversing an inner space (31)
delimited by a tunnel (3) or a hood assembly sealed off

from the surrounding atmosphere, the said tunnel or
assembly being connected in a sealed manner to the said

device or including the said device.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the said electric discharge, which has the said

device as its seat and which is used to convert the
said initial gaseous mixture, is created between a

first electrode (14) and a second electrode (17), a
layer (16) of a dielectric material being disposed on

the surface of at least one of the electrodes (17)
opposite the other electrode, and in that the said

initial gaseous mixture traverses the discharge
transversely to the electrodes.
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the energy used in the said device, per unit area

of dielectric, is greater than 1 W/cm
2
, preferably
greater than 10 W/cm
2
.
Process according to one of Claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that the treatment atmosphere

encountered successively by the component to be treated
along the conveyor is divided into zones as follows:


a) at least one of the devices (11, 4, 12) for
the production of excited or unstable gaseous species

converts a different initial gaseous mixture (7) from
that converted by the device preceding it in the said

tunnel (3) or assembly, and/or 
b) the adjacent gaseous mixture (9, 10) used at
at least one of the devices (11, 4, 12) for the

production of excited or unstable gaseous species is
different from that used at the device preceding it in

the said tunnel or assembly.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in
that stages a) and b) take place at one single device.
Use of an apparatus for the dry surface
treatment of at least one metal surface portion for

carrying out the process according to one of Claims 1
to 9, which apparatus comprises a tunnel (3) or hood

assembly defining an inner space (31) traversed by
conveying means (2) for the components (1) including

the portion or portions to be treated, sealed off from
the surrounding atmosphere, connected in a sealed

manner to or including one or more devices (11, 4, 12)
for the production of excited or unstable gaseous

species arranged in series and/or in parallel,
comprising at least one tubular gas passage (18) having

an axis formed between an outer electrode (14) and an
inner electrode (17), at least one of the electrodes

including a dielectric coating (16) opposite the other
electrode, the electrodes being connected to a high-voltage

and high-frequency source, the outer electrode
(14) surrounding the dielectric (16) and including an

inlet (20) for the gas referred to as the initial gas
and an outlet (21) for the gas referred to as the

primary gas, this inlet and outlet being elongated,
parallel to the axis and substantially diametrically

opposite to one another, the said gas outlet opening
into the interior of the said tunnel or assembly, the

said tunnel or assembly being provided with at least
one means (9, 10, 13) for the injection of a gas

referred to as the adjacent gas which does not pass
