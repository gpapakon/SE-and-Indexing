<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a peptide 
which causes the blast formation of lymphocytes of 
allergic patients sensitized with mite allergen. Such a 
peptide can be used for the diagnosis of mite allergy. In order to diagnose so-called type I allergy, 
such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, a method 
has heretofore been used which employs a causative 
antigen (i.e. allergen). That is, there has been widely used a method 
wherein an allergen is injected intradermally or dropped 
onto slightly injured skin and the resulting skin 
reaction is observed to identify the allergen, or such a 
method as RAST, wherein allergen specific IgE in blood 
serum is detected in vitro. In these methods of diagnosis, allergens 
extracted from naturally occurring substances have 
hitherto been used. That is, crude allergens extracted 
from allergen-containing substances, as pollen, house 
dust and mites, with, for example, the Coca solution 
(Practice Allergy, third edition, written by W.T. 
Vaughhan & J.H. Black) have been used. Consequently, 
these methods often cause side reactions and hence tend 
to lead to diagnosis of insufficient accuracy. Recently, 
for the purpose of obtaining pure allergens, a number of  
 
attempts have been made to prepare major allergens of 
pollen or mites by means of genetic recombination (R. 
Valena et al., Int. Arch. Allergy & Applied Immunol., 97, 
287 (1992), Japanese Patent Application Nos. H-3-262538 
and H-3-310069). Mites are one of the most important allergens 
causing type I allergy. For preparing a mite allergen, 
there are known, as described above, a method which 
extracts it from mite bodies and a method which prepare 
it by genetic recombination. By the method of extraction 
from mite bodies, however, it is difficult to prepare the 
purified allergen in large quantity. By the method of 
preparing a mite allergen through genetic recombination, 
on the other hand, it is impossible to prepare solely the 
allergenic activity-bearing low molecular weight portion 
which constitutes a part of the major allergen protein of 
mites, unlike in the process of the present invention. Accordingly, the present inventors have 
attempted to prepare a substance having allergenic 
activity easily and in a pure form by chemically 
synthesizing solely the allergenic activity-bearing 
portion of the major allergen protein of mites. Thus, 
the inventors have synthesized various parts of the amino 
acid sequence of Der f II, which is one of the major 
allergens of Dermatophagoides farinae,
