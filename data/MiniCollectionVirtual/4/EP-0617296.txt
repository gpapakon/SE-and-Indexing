<ABSTRACT>
The obstacles intersecting a plane P substantially parallel to the floor of the vehicle 1 are detected and the coordinates of each point of intersection of these obstacles with the plane P are defined in a reference frame related to the plane P. An image sensor 2 is used which consists of an objective, a matrix-configured sensor and means for electronically processing the image, these means being coupled to means for providing information to the vehicle's driver, the objective consisting of a lens or of a portion of a cylindrical lens. The image sensor is placed in the vehicle so that its field is superposed to the plane P.

Obstacle-detection device on board a motor vehicle, intended to detect
obstacles intersecting a plane P substantially parallel to the floor of the vehicle

and passing through this vehicle, this device comprising an image sensor
constituted by an objective, a matrix-type sensor on which an image is formed,

and means for electronically processing the image, coupled with means for
informing the driver of the vehicle, characterised in that

the matrix-type sensor is located in a plane substantially perpendicular to the
plane P and to the plane of symmetry of the vehicle, the objective is constituted

by a cylindrical lens or a portion of cylindrical lens, the axis of which is parallel
to the plane of the matrix-type sensor and inclined with respect to the plane of

symmetry of the vehicle, this image sensor being placed inside the vehicle so
that its field is superimposed on the plane P, and the image-processing means

are arranged so as to define, within a reference point connected to the plane
P, the co-ordinates of each point of intersection of said obstacles with the

plane P.
Device according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the image sensor is fixed to the rear face of the internal

rear-view mirror of the vehicle and is slightly inclined downwards.
Device according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the image sensor is fixed to the vehicle at the level of the
projectors and is slightly inclined upwards.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that the cylindrical lens is replaced by a superimposition of
lenses or portions of spherical lenses offset from one another so that their

optical centres are on the same axis parallel to the plane of the matrix-type
sensor but inclined with respect thereto.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the electronic processing means determine the co-ordinates

 and z of each point of intersection of the obstacles with the plane
P, the origin of the co-ordinates being located level with the sensor, by the

following relationships:


where

δ is the resolution of the matrix-type sensor
d is the distance between the objective and the matrix-type sensor
a is the distance between the projections, on the plane P, of the extreme
optical centres of the objective
i is the abscissa of the intersection with the first line of the matrix of the
matrix-type sensor of the segment of straight line that constitutes the

image of the point, the co-ordinates of which are sought, this segment
being extracted by means of an image-processing algorithm
Δi = j - i, j being the abscissa of the intersection with the last line of the
matrix of the matrix-type sensor, of the segment of straight line that

constitutes the image of the point, the co-ordinates for which are sought,
this segment being extracted by means of an image-processing algorithm.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that the means for informing the driver are visual, and
comprise for example a display screen integrated into the driving station.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that the means for informing the driver are sound-based.
