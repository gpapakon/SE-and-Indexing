<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive tool insert (10) comprises a cemented 
metallic substrate (11) and a polycrystalline diamond layer (12) 

formed thereon by high pressure, high temperature 
processing. The interface between the substrate and the 

diamond layer forms a sawtooth shaped cross-sectional 
profile (13,15) including a number of surfaces (14) sloping outwardly 

and downwardly toward a cutting edge (25) of the insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
abrasive tool inserts and, more particularly, to such 
inserts having a sawtooth shaped diamond/substrate 
interface to provide improved durability and reduced 
susceptibility to spalling, cracking and wear of the 
diamond layer. Abrasive compacts are used extensively in cutting, 
milling, grinding, drilling and other abrasive 
operations. The abrasive compacts typically consist of 
polycrystalline diamond or cubic boron nitride particles 
bonded into a coherent hard conglomerate. The abrasive 
particle content of abrasive compacts is high and there 
is an extensive amount of direct particle-to-particle 
bonding. Abrasive compacts are made under elevated 
temperature and pressure conditions at which the abrasive 
particle, be it diamond or cubic boron nitride, is 
crystallographically stable. Abrasive compacts tend to be brittle and, in use, 
they are frequently supported by being bonded to a 
cemented carbide substrate. Such supported abrasive 
compacts are known in the art as composite abrasive 
compacts. The composite abrasive compact may be used as  
 
such in the working surface of an abrasive tool. 
Alternatively, particularly in drilling and mining 
operations, it has been found advantageous to bond the 
composite abrasive compact to an elongated cemented 
carbide pin to produce what is known as a stud cutter. 
The stud cutter is then mounted in the working surface of 
a drill bit or a mining pick. Fabrication of the composite is typically achieved 
by placing a cemented carbide substrate into the 
container of a press. A mixture of diamond grains or 
diamond grains and catalyst binder is placed atop the 
substrate and compressed under high pressure, high 
temperature (HPHT) conditions. In so doing, metal binder 
migrates from the substrate and "sweeps" through the 
diamond grains to promote a sintering of the diamond 
grains. As a result, the diamond grains become bonded to 
each other to form a diamond layer, and that diamond 
layer is bonded to the substrate along a conventionally 
planar interface. Metal binder remains disposed in the 
diamond layer within pores defined between the diamond 
grains. A composite formed in the above-described manner may 
be subject to a number of shortcomings. For example, the 
coefficients of thermal expansion and elastic constants 
of cemented carbide and diamond are close but not exactly 
the same. Thus, during heating or cooling of the 
polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC), thermally induced  
 
stresses occur
