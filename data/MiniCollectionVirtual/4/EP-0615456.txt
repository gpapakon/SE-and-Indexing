<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a disposable injection device (1) with a barrel (2), an injection needle (6) and a piston (4) which can slide in the interior (3) of the barrel (2). The piston is connected to a piston rod (5) extending in the opposite direction to the injection needle (6) so as to move. In the interior (3) of the barrel (2) is a non-return valve arrangement (7) between the piston (4) and the injection needle (6) with a blocking component (23) which is held in a cylindrical casing section in an acceptance chamber (18) via a preferably elastically deformable retainer (17). The retainer (17) is arranged at a distance (73) from a frontal side of an inlet channel (42) facing it. This distance (73) is greater than the length running parallel to the longitudinal direction of the injection device (1) or a diameter (24) of the blocking component (23). The cylindrical cage housing (8) is divided into an inlet chamber (18) and an inlet space (19) for the blocking component (23) by the retainer (17). The inlet chamber (18) facing the piston (4) is closed off by a frontal surface (9) of the case housing (8), the cylindrical extension (10) of which is supported on one outer surface (56) on the inner surface (57) of the barrel (2) and in a recess (13) of which is inserted the cage (14). The inlet space (19) is open towards the injection needle (6) or the inlet channel (42) leading to the needle (6). The blocking component (23) is fitted between the retainer (17) and the frontal surface (9) of the cage housing (8).
