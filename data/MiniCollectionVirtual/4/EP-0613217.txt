<ABSTRACT>
A retention system is provided for an electrical 
connector (10) adapted to be mounted on the surface (22) of 

a printed circuit board (12). The connector includes a 
housing (11) having a circuit board mounting face (14). At 

least one retention member (24) is provided for securing 
the connector to the printed circuit board. The retention 

member is generally U-shaped defining a pair of leg 
sections (26, 28) extending generally perpendicular to the 

circuit board and a bight section (30) joining the leg 
sections generally parallel to the circuit board. The 

bight section defines a pad for solder connection to a 
solder pad on the circuit board, and the bight section has 

a given width transverse to the U-shaped profile of the 
retention member. A recess (42) in the circuit board 

mounting face of the connector housing is complementarily 
shaped for receiving at least one (26) of the leg sections 

of the retention member in an interference fit therewith. 
The one leg section (26) is narrower than the given width 

of the bight section. At least one stabilizing flange (32) 
projects from the bight section into a complementarily 

shaped recess (44) in the circuit board mounting face (14). 
The stabilizing flange is coplanar with, narrower and 

shorter than the one leg section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector and, 
particularly, to a retention system for an electrical 
connector adapted to be mounted on the surface of a printed 
circuit board, with the features of the preamble to claim 1 
or 6. Electrical connectors which are adapted for 
mounting to printing circuit boards typically have a 
plurality of terminals for electrically engaging respective 
circuit traces on the surface of the board. The electrical 
engagement most commonly is effected by one of two systems. 
First, the terminals may have pin portions projecting from 
the connector for insertion into plated-through holes in 
the board wherein conductive plating material on the inside 
walls of the holes make electrical connection to circuit 
traces on the board surface. Second, the terminals may 
have leg portions extending generally parallel to the board 
surface and into engagement with the solder traces on the 
board surface. In both systems, the electrical engagement 
commonly is effected by soldering the pin portions to the 
circuit traces or the plating material in the holes in the 
board, or the leg portions to the circuit traces on the 
surface of the board. In contemporary surface mount techniques, the 
individual terminals of the surface mount connector are 
connected to reflow solder pads of the circuit traces on 
the surface of the board. Increasing miniaturization and 
complexity of integrated circuit devices necessitates that  
 
the terminals be both relatively thin and closely spaced, 
with the resulting fragility requiring that the connector 
housing, itself, also be secured to the circuit board to 
afford strain relief for the terminal electrical 
engagements. A common type of strain relief has been 
provided for many years by mounting pegs or "boardlocks" 
which project from the connector housing into mounting or 
locking holes in the printed circuit board. However, with 
the increasing miniaturization and complexity of integrated 
circuit devices, such boardlocks consume valuable "real 
estate" on the circuit board. In addition, if electronic 
devices are to be mounted on both opposite sides of the 
board, mounting pegs or boardlocks cannot project through 
the board to the opposite side of the board where they will 
interfere with other electronic devices. Consequently, it 
is becoming common practice to secure such connectors on 
the surface of a printed circuit board by using a metal 
retaining device having a first portion anchored to the 
connector housing and a second,
