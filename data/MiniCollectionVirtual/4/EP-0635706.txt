<ABSTRACT>
A temperature indicator is described which consists of a substrate (1) comprising a plurality of juxtaposed distinct zones (I to VIII) which are each covered with a first thermosensitive material (A) and at least a second thermosensitive material (B, C), which each react in a determined temperature range which is different for each zone but of constant width. In each zone, the overlap of the temperature ranges of each material is zero. Each of the thermosensitive materials (A, B, C) has a part of its reaction-temperature range which is in common with a part of the temperature range of one of the materials (A, B, C) of an adjacent zone. This overlap is smaller by one step than each of the said temperature ranges. With three thermosensitive materials per zone, 24 sensor elements are provided, which makes it possible to obtain a single, inactive sensor 18 times, that is to say 18 temperatures at the resolution of the step. The temperature is read beside the inactive zone.

Temperature indicator constituted by a substrate 
(1) comprising a plurality of distinct juxtaposed zones (I 

to VIII) each being covered over by a first thermosensitive 
material (A) reacting within a first predetermined 

temperature range, said first temperature range 
being different for each of said zones (I to VIII), 

characterized in that each of said zones is further 
covered over by at least one second thermosensitive 

material (B) reacting within a second predetermined 
temperature range, said second temperature range being 

different for each of said zones, the overlapping of said 
first temperature range with said second temperature range 

being inexistent within each zone. 
Temperature indicator according to claim 1, 
characterized in that each zone (I to VIII) further 

comprises a third thermosensitive material (C) reacting 
within a third predetermined temperature range, the 

overlapping of said third temperature range with said 
first and second temperature ranges being inexistent 

within each zone. 
Temperature indicator according to either claims 
1 or 2, characterized in that one of said thermosensitive 

materials (A, B or C) from a first zone (I to VIII) 
exhibits a portion of its temperature range on one of said 

materials (A, B or C) from a second adjacent zone and in 
that the overlapping of the temperature range of the first 

zone with the temperature range of said material of said 
second zone is inferior to each of said temperature 

ranges. 
Temperature indicator according to any of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the span of common 

temperatures is constant.  
 
Temperature indicator according to any of claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the breadth of said 

temperature ranges is identical for each thermosensitive 
material. 
Temperature indicator according to any of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that said zones (I to VIII) are 

arranged in a ring. 
Temperature indicator according to any of claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that said thermosensitive 

materials (A, B, C) are deposited onto the substrate (1) 
in successive superposed layers. 
Temperature indicator according to any of claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that said thermosensitive 

materials (A, B, C) are respectively encapsulated and 
mixed in a layer formed from a transparent binder (3). 
Temperature indicator according to any of claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that said substrate (1) is formed 

of a material exhibiting a high thermal conductivity. 
Temperature indicator according to any of claims 
1 to 9, characterized in that said substrate (1) comprises 

a black bottom surface on which said thermosensitive 
materials (A, B, C) are deposited. 
Watch (4) provided with a temperature indicator 
in accordance with any of claims 1 to 10.
