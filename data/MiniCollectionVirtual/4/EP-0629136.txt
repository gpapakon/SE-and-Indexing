<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable breath-actuated
inhaler comprising a tubular housing having at
least two parts forming an air flow path being open at
both ends, one end forming an air inlet and one end
forming an air outlet, said housing comprising a
compartment for storing a pharmaceutical powder to be
inhaled, said housing is being shaped with a constriction
adjacent the compartment in order to obtain a turbulent
air stream at the constriction upon inhalation thereby
lifting the powder out from the indentation and mixing it
into the air stream.Disposable, breath-actuated inhalers of the kind
described above are for instance disclosed in WO
89/01348, US-A-4,265,236, EP-A-0404454, US-A-5 042
472 and WO-A-9204069.EP-A-0404454 discloses a disposable, breath-actuated
inhaler comprising a chamber for a pharmaceutical powder,
said chamber being provided with an air inlet and with an
air outlet. The air inlet and outlet are covered by a 
common cover. The powder is disposed loosely in said
comparatively large chamber which means that the powder
not necessarily will be located at that location at which
the air flow is most efficient.US-A-4,265,236 discloses a tubular disposable, breath-actuated
inhaler comprising a flexible tube, the ends of
which normally being sealingly inserted into each other.
This kind of seal will not necessarily be moisture-proof.
There furthermore is a risk that some amount of the
powder may fall out of the inhaler when the ends of the
tube are pulled apart.WO 89/01348, in the embodiment most of interest here,
discloses a tubular, disposable inhaler which is sealed
in both ends by means of twist-off caps. The
pharmaceutical powder is loosely disposed in the inhaler
and, as in the other inhalers described above, there is a
risk that some powder is lost when the inhaler is opened.US-A-5 042 472 discloses a breath-actuated inhaler having
a pharmaceutical active powder provided in a compartment
which is includes the inhalation inlet and outlet as well
as the inhalation chamber. The powder is provided loose
in the chamber in a manner which is similar to what is
shown in EP-A-0 404 454 as mentioned above. The
disadvantages with a device like this has already been
discussed above. WO-A-9 204 069 describes an inhaler of the type described
in the upper part of claim 1 and which constitutes the
background to the present invention. This is a disposable
breath-actuated inhaler having a tubular housing defining
the air flow path. An air inlet and an air outlet is
provided at each end
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Disposable breath-actuated inhaler comprising a
tubular housing having two parts (1, 2) forming

an air flow path being open at both ends, one end forming
an air inlet (4) and one end forming an air outlet (5),

said housing comprising a compartment (3) for storing a
pharmaceutical powder to be inhaled, said housing is

being shaped with a constriction(9) adjacent the
compartment (3) in order to obtain a turbulent air stream

at the constriction (9) upon inhalation thereby lifting
the powder out from the compartment (3) and mixing it

into the air stream, wherein the compartment is provided
as an indentation (3) being in contact with the ambient

air through at least one through-hole (24) provided in
the bottom of said indentation, the indentation (3) being

located adjacent the air inlet (4), said
indentation (3) and the at least one through-hole (24) is

covered by a foil (6) sealing the indentation and the at
least one through-hole in an airtight way, said foil

being removable from the indentation and the at least one
through-hole from outside the housing. 
Inhaler according to claim 1,
characterised
 in that the at least two parts
of the housing are formed as a moulded upper part (1) and

a generally flat lower part (2) in which the powder 
indentation is provided, said upper and lower parts (1,

2) being joined together along their longitudinal sides.
Inhaler according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised
 in that the upper part (1) is
moulded from a sheet of plastics material.
Inhaler according to claim 3,
characterised
 in that said constriction (9)
is formed as a depression in the upper side of the said

upper part (1) which is oriented transversally relative
to the longitudinal extent of the tubular housing and

located above the indentation (3) formed in the lower
part of the housing.
Inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised
 in that the lower part (2) is
made of aluminium foil laminated with plastics.
Inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised
 in that the foil (6) is in the
form of a tape having one free end extending out through

the air inlet (4), said tape being attached around edges
of the indentation (3) by means of relatively weak

welds(22).
Inhaler according to claim 6,
characterised
 in that the inner end of the
foil (6) is attached to the lower part (2) between the 

air inlet (4) and the indentation (3) the foil extending
past, and being attached around, the indentation (3), the

foil then being bent backwards about so as to extend out
through the air inlet (4).
Inhaler according to claim 7,
characterised
 in that the weak welds (22)
form a point facing downstream.
Inhaler according to any one of claims 6 to 8,
characterised
 in that projections (7, 8)
extend downwards from the upper part (1) between the

indentation (3) and the air inlet (4) for holding the
foil (6) against the lower part (2) of the housing.
Inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised
 in that deaggregation means
(11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) are located in the air flow path

between the indentation (3) and the air outlet (5). 
Inhaler according to claim 10,
characterised
 in that said deaggregation
means (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) comprise planar surfaces

oriented 20° - 40°, preferably about 30°, relative to the
longitudinal direction of the tubular housing, said

surfaces being disposed generally perpendicular to a
plane through the longitudinal axis of the tubular

housing, a projection of the planar surfaces onto a
cross-section of the housing substantially covering said

cross-section.
