<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus for monitoring and controlling 
the operation of a refrigeration unit (20) in a manner 

which eliminates the need for circuit breakers and fuses in 
control circuits which are instrumental in selecting and 

changing the operational mode of the refrigeration unit. 
When a need to change to a different operating mode is 

detected, a controller (96) energizes a control device 
associated with the different operating mode and quickly 

determines if the current draw is within an acceptable 
range. If the current draw is within an acceptable range 

or window, the controller initiates the requested different 
operating mode. If the current draw is not within the 

acceptable range, the controller generates an appropriate 
alarm and different courses of action are decided upon 

which depend upon whether the current draw is above or 
below the limits of the acceptable range, the nature of the 

requested operating mode, and the desired temperature of a 
space conditioned by the refrigeration unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to monitoring and controlling
methods and apparatus for refrigeration units which
have microprocessor based electrical control.U.S. Patent 4,663,725, which is assigned to the
same assignee as the present application, discloses the use
of microprocessor based transport refrigeration control for
use with a refrigerated container, with the refrigerant
compressor being driven by an electric motor. This patent
is directed primarily to the use of a microprocessor to
operate the various components of the refrigeration system
according to predetermined algorithms, and to detect and
record faults which occur during the operation thereof.U.S. Patent 4,918,932, which is assigned to the
same assignee as the present application, discloses the use
of a microprocessor to determine average error between an
operator selected set point temperature and the temperature
of a space to be conditioned, using the outputs of return
air and discharge air sensors, and the use of the average
error in the determination of an error signal which modulates
the capacity of the system.Our U.S. Patent 5,140,825, which is assigned to
the same assignee as the present application and which is considered as showing the most relevant prior art, discloses a
method which checks electrical components and wiring of a
microprocessor controlled refrigeration system by using a
battery and a current shunt which measures battery current. 
All checking is accomplished with a refrigerant prime mover
off, so that an alternator driven thereby will not affect
battery draw current. Each electrical component to be
checked is automatically successively connected and disconnected
from the battery, the current draw is compared with
appropriate current draw limits, and an alarm is provided
when the current draw is outside the draw limits.It would be desirable, and it is an object of the
invention to be able to monitor current draw of a refrigeration
unit while it is operating, which, along with the
teachings in our aforesaid patent, will provide complete
protection for a refrigeration unit.Refrigeration control systems of which we are
aware utilize circuit breakers and fuses to isolate faulty
components. Circuit breakers and fuses often result in
unnecessarily shutting down the associated refrigeration
unit when it is still capable of preserving a conditioned
load, and circuit breakers and fuses add component and
assembly cost to a refrigeration unit. It would be desirable,
and it is another object of the present invention, to
eliminate the
