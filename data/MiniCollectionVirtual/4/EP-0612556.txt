<ABSTRACT>
A process for removal of hydrogen sulfide is here 
provided by which sulfur and hydrogen can be efficiently 

recovered from a hydrogen sulfide-containing gas and secondarily 
produced sulfuric acid can be properly treated, 

whereby a long-term continuous operation is possible in a 
closed system. 
The invention is mainly directed to a process which 
comprises the steps of bringing a hydrogen sulfide-containing 

gas into contact with an aqueous iron salt (Fe³⁺) 
solution to carry out oxidation reaction and to thereby 

produce a solution containing Fe²⁺, sulfur and secondarily 
produced sulfuric acid in a hydrogen sulfide gas absorption-oxidation 

step, separating sulfur from the solution, electrochemically 
treating the solution to regenerate the 

aqueous iron salt (Fe³⁺) solution, bringing a part of the 
solution from which sulfur has been separated into contact 

with hydrogen to reduce secondarily produced sulfuric acid 
contained in the solution and to thereby produce hydrogen 

sulfide, and then returning the thus produced hydrogen 
sulfide to the hydrogen sulfide gas absorption-oxidation 

step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the improvement of a 
process for removal of hydrogen sulfide. More specifically, 
it relates to a process for removal of hydrogen sulfide which 
comprises a combination of an aqueous iron salt solution 
treatment and an electrochemical regeneration to recover 
sulfur and a hydrogen gas from a hydrogen sulfide-containing 
gas and which can inhibit the generation of industrial wastes 
(e.g., a waste iron solution, waste acids and waste iron 
salts), permits a long-term continuous operation in a closed 
system, and can efficiently recover sulfur and hydrogen. Heretofore, hydrogen sulfide discharged in the 
refining of petroleum has been industrially treated by a 
Claus method. However, according to this method, a sulfur 
component in hydrogen sulfide can be recovered as sulfur, but 
a hydrogen component is converted into water without being 
recovered, and so the industrially efficient utilization of a 
hydrogen component cannot be realized. Recently, as process for recovering sulfur and the 
hydrogen gas from hydrogen sulfide by means of oxidation and 
an electrochemical treatment, there are known methods in  
 
which an aqueous iron salt solution containing ferric ions is 
used. In such methods, various kinds of aqueous iron salt 
solutions containing the ferric ions are used, but in any 
process, the secondary production of a trace amount of 
sulfuric acid cannot be avoided. In consequence, sulfuric 
acid is accumulated in the aqueous iron salt solution, and 
the iron salt finally precipitates, which is a serious defect 
from the viewpoint of process. As an improvement technique capable of eliminating 
this drawback, the group of the present inventors has already 
developed a technique in which an aqueous phosphoric acid-iron 
chloride solution is used to decrease the amount of 
secondarily produced sulfuric acid. However, subsequent 
researches have elucidated that the concentration of sulfuric 
acid in the aqueous iron-containing solution increases, while 
the solution is circularly used for a long time, and so it is 
necessary to blow down the aqueous iron salt containing 
solution as a waste solution in a certain ratio and to 
simultaneously make up the fresh aqueous iron salt containing 
solution in order to keep the suitable sulfuric acid concentration. A first object of the present invention is to provide 
a process for removal of hydrogen sulfide which can properly 
treat secondarily produced sulfuric acid to efficiently 
recover sulfur and hydrogen without
