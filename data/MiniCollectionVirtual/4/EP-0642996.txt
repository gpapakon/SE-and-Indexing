<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises at least one pair (2 or 3) of conveyor belts which are arranged parallel and opposite each other and the actuating drums of which are oriented along vertical axes; the plate (1) for setting in motion is introduced between these belts, one at least of these being capable of being displaced in a transverse direction with respect to the advance of the plate, so as to permit adaptation of the whole to the thickness of the plate.
