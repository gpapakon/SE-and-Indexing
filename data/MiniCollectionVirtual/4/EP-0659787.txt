<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is relating to block copolymers and high shear
strength pressure sensitive adhesive compositions, comprising them.
More in particular, the invention is relating to block copolymers
to be used in pressure sensitive adhesive tape, which is especially
suited for sealing boxes and which must exhibit a relatively high
value of shear strength (further to be mentioned packaging tape).It will be appreciated that, moreover, such a tape
simultaneously has to be relatively soft and be economically
feasible, i.e. it must be produced at a cost price as low as
possible.Varying efforts were made during the last decades to provide
such basic block copolymers.US patent No. 3,239,478 disclosed an adhesive comprising a
block copolymer having a general configuration A-B-A, wherein each
A is thermoplastic polymer block and which is relatively
incompatible with the elastomeric B segment; the average molecular
weight of each A being between about 5,000 and 125,000; B is a
polymer block of a conjugated diene, the average molecular weight
of the blocks being between about 15,000 and about 250,000; the
total of blocks A being less than about 80% by weight of the block
copolymer; in addition to the block copolymer a tackifying resin
and a particular extender oil, said oil being substantially
incompatible with homopolymers of the aforesaid thermoplastic
terminal blocks and being substantially compatible with
homopolymers of the aforesaid conjugated diene. Compositions of the
block copolymer described above with 5 to 200 phr (preferably 25 to
125 phr) (parts per hundred of block copolymer) of extending oil
and 25 to 300 phr (preferably 50 to 200 phr) of a tackifying resin
were disclosed. By adjustment of the proportions of the three basic 
ingredients and choice of molecular weight of copolymer, melting
point and type of tackifying resin, compatibility of oil and resin
with the copolymer, a hot-melt adhesive can be provided.US patent no. 3,723,170 and in particular column 4, lines 47-58
and example V, disclosed poly(styrene)-poly(isoprene)-poly(styrene)
block copolymers, having poly(styrene) blocks of a
number average molecular weight of 7000, 3.200 and 21.800
respectively in combination with a poly(styrene) content of 20% and
total number average molecular weight of 70.000 (Ex III),
132.000(Ex V), and 218.000 (Ex VI) respectively.US patent No. 3,753,936 disclosed (A-B)xY type polymers
wherein A represents non-elastomeric polymer blocks, or segments,
and B represents elastomeric polymer segments, Y is an atom or
group
