<ABSTRACT>
The field of the invention is that of cellular radiocommunication with mobile stations, especially according to the GSM standard. The objective is to furnish a reliable method, free of cumbersome constraints for the network and for the mobile, and relying only on existing procedures between mobile and network. According to the invention, the redefinition of frequencies is performed time interval by time interval, freeing each time interval step by step by suppression of all communication in the said interval, then by carrying out a frequency-based redefinition of the said freed time interval by allocating it the new list of frequencies, and finally by making the said time interval again available to the traffic.
