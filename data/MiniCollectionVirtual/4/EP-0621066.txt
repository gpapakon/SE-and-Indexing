<ABSTRACT>
In a filter assembly for flowing water, a backwashing device is provided which contains a backwashing element (18) furnished with at least one slot-shaped inlet orifice (44), which backwashing element can be connected on the outlet side to a backwash duct. The backwashing element (18) is arranged to be axially displaceable within a filter element (16). The slot-shaped inlet orifice (44) which essentially points radially towards the inner surface of the filter element (16) sweeps over the entire dirty water-side filter surface when there is an axial displacement of the backwashing element (18), so that the filter element (16) is successively cleaned over its entire height by water flowing out of the clean water chamber (28) through the filter element (16) to the backwashing element. The backwashing element has a step piston (66) which, with the aid of a manually or automatically activatable control device can be selectively impinged with various pressures which effect a self-acting axial displacement of the backwashing element (18) between the two end positions.

A backwashable filter assembly comprising a first chamber
(28) for untreated water which is adapted to be subjected

to untreated water by way of an inlet (26), a second
chamber (32) for treated water which is separated from the

first chamber by means of an essentially hollow-cylindrical
filter element (16) and which leads to an

outlet (30) for the treated water, a backwashing chamber
(34) which is adapted to be connected to a sealable

backwashing conduit (109), and a backwashing element (18)
which is positioned within the filter element (16), which

is axially displacable over the surface of the filter
element (16) on the untreated water side, and which is

adapted to be connected to the backwashing chamber (34) on
the outlet side, wherein the backwashing element comprises

an inlet opening (44) formed to be a slit-shaped
circumferential opening radially oriented toward the inner

surface of filter element, which inlet opening is disposed
at at least one wiper element (42) which abuts the filter

element (16) with the limiting edges of the inlet opening
(44) and which axially glides thereon during displacement

of the backwashing element (18), which wiper element
further carries at its end which extends into the

backwashing chamber (34) a seal member (62) which adapted
to be pressed a
gainst a seal (60) in the region of the
backwashing conduit, and which at its end opposed to the

seal member (62) extends in a pressure tight manner from
the chamber (34) for untreated water with a piston 

attachment (66) into a control chamber (76) which is
adapted to be subjected to the main supply pressure,


characterized in that
 the piston attachment (66) is formed
to be a differential piston, the effective piston area of

which is smaller toward the chamber (28) for untrated
water than toward the control chamber (76), and in that

the control chamber (76) permanently communicates with the
chamber (28) for untreated water or with the chamber (32)

for treated water by way of a choke element (96), and is
adapted to be connected by way of a shut-off valve (98) to

a relief conduit (100) which is at atmospheric pressure
and which is connected to the backwashing conduit (109).
The filter assembly of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
backwashing element (18) is spring biased in the sealing

position of the seal member (62), preferably by means of a
return spring (86) disposed within the control chamber

(76).
The filter assembly of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the choke element (96) is formed to be a jet which is
preferably disposed is a branch conduit subjected to

untreated water.
The filter assembly of claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a
filter sieve (94) is disposed upstream of the choke

element (96) in the branch conduit (92).
The filter assembly of one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
in that
 the shut-off valve (98) is formed to be a seat
valve, in particular a membrane valve, the valve body or

membrane (100) of which is actuatable by means of a tappet
(112) which is made from a magnetizable material and which 

is spring biased in the direction of closing and
displaceable against the spring bias in the opening

direction by means of a magnet.
The filter assembly of claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the
shut-off valve (98) comprises a push button (118) which is

fitted with a permanent magnet (120) and which is adapted
to be displaced with its permanent magnet in the direction

of the tappet (112) against the force of a return spring
(122).
The filter assembly of claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the
shut-off valve (98) comprises an elctromagnet (123) which

is disposed in the vicinity of the tappet (112) and which
is adapted to be subjected to an electric current by way

of a central control unit.
The filter assembly of one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized
in that
 the piston attachment (66) of the backwashing
element (18) is formed to be a hollow piston which is

closed-off in a pressure-tight manner with respect to the
control chamber (76), preferably by means of a cover (78),

the hollow space of which piston communicates with the
relief conduit (100) and is open toward the backwashing

conduit by way of a drain conduit (108) which centrally
extends through the backwashing element (18) and the seal

member (62).
The filter assembly of claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the

attachment (66). 
The filter assembly of claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that

the hollow piston cover (78) comprises a depression (84)

The filter assembly of one of claims 1 to 10,

characterized in that
 the piston attachment (66) comprises
two axially spaced sealing rings (88, 90) having different
