<ABSTRACT>
A refrigeration system is disclosed which incorporates 

apparatus for preventing overheating of the compressor (10, 10') by 
selectively feeding liquid refrigerant from the outlet of the 

condenser (16, 16') to the compressor (10, 10'). 
In one embodiment the refrigerant 

fluid from the condenser (16) is injected into the suction manifold (52) 
of the compressor (10). In another embodiment this fluid is injected 

directly into the compression chamber or chambers (88, 90). Control 
means are provided which include a 

temperature sensor (32, 70, 112) located 
within the compressor discharge 

chamber (58, 114) and valve means (38, 100, 102) 
responsive thereto to control the flow of liquid refrigerant to 

the suction manifold (52) or compression chamber (88, 90).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
refrigeration systems and more particularly to refrigeration 
systems incorporating means to prevent overheating of the 
compressor by selectively injecting liquid refrigerant into the 
suction manifold. In response to recent concerns over depletion of the 
ozone layer due to release of various types of refrigerants such 
as R12, the government has imposed increasingly stricter 
limitations on the use of these refrigerants. These limitations 
will require refrigeration systems of the future to utilize 
substitute refrigerants. Presently, the available substitutes 
for commonly used refrigerants such as R-12 and R-502 are not 
well suited for low temperature applications because they result 
in high discharge temperatures which may damage or shorten the 
life expectancy of the compressor particularly under high load 
situations and high compression ratios. Liquid injection systems have long been used in 
refrigeration systems in an effort to limit or control excessive 
discharge gas temperatures which cause overheating of the 
compressor and may result in breakdown of the compressor 
lubricant. Typically, these prior systems utilized capillary 
tubes or thermal expansion valves to control the fluid 
injection. However, such systems have been very inefficient and 
the capillary tubes and thermal expansion valves were prone to 
leaking during periods when such injection cooling was not  
 
needed. This leakage could result in flooding of the 
compressor. Additionally, when the compressor was shut 
down, the high pressure liquid could migrate from the 
receiver to the low pressure suction side through these 
capillary tubes or expansion valves, thereby resulting in 
slugging of the compressor upon startup. Also, the 
thermal sensors utilised by these prior systems were 
typically located in the discharge line between the 
compressor and the condenser. This positioning of the 
sensor often resulted in inadequate cooling as the sensed 
temperature could vary greatly from the actual temperature 
of the discharge gas exiting the compression chamber due 
to a variety of factors such as the ambient temperature 
around the discharge line and the mass flow rate of 
discharge gas. Thus, overheating of the compressor could 
occur due to an erroneous sensed temperature of the 
discharge gas. Typical of such a prior system is the one 
illustrated in US-A-4 049 410 which provides the basis for 
the prior art portion of claim 1. The present invention, as defined in claim 1, 
ove
