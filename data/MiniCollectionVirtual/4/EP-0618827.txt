<ABSTRACT>
A golfer's stance for correctly addressing a golf ball using different clubs is taught or improved by using a mat having a ball line on it with markings showing the different locations at which the ball should be put. The mat has on it either a single detachable strip or different sets of detachable or permanent strips. The or each strip indicates optimum stance lines with which the golfer's feet should be aligned when using a club of weight or number associated with the strip being used at any one time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golfing apparatus, and
particularly to apparatus for teaching golfers where
their feet should be placed when hitting a golf ball in a
specified direction with a known club. The apparatus can
be used to train tyro golfers, or to help experienced
golfers to eliminate a stance or swing defect.People wishing to learn golf usually take lessons from an
experienced golfer and/or use a video to learn the
correct grip and stance. The present invention aims at
providing a teaching aid to act as a visual guide,
intended to be recalled from memory by the golfer when
addressing a ball and used mentally to position the feet
correctly when wishing to use a selected club.Various apparatus has been proposed to assist in
developing appropriate stance and swing. US Patent
Specification 4384718 discloses a device consisting of
three flat strips variably positionable one with another
to secure appropriate positioning of the golfer's feet
and the ball. A more popular approach to the problem
involves the provision of a mat with markings on it on 
which the golfer is to stand. US Specifications 4915387,
2606026 and 4023810, and British Patent Specification
1305710 are representative of this approach. Most
involve complex markings for foot position and they do
not address the importance of providing a visual guide
corresponding to the desired line of flight of the ball
when it is struck.United States Patent Specification 4434983 discloses a
mat having a T-bar guide secured to its surface with the
horizontal portion of the T providing a plurality of
possible positions in which a tee may be located. The
device shown in this specification, however, does not
allow for the positioning of the feet of the golfer such
that the line joining the fronts of the golfer's feet
when positioned on the mat runs at an angle to the
intended line of flight of the ball. It is inflexible
and visually cluttered.We have now found that improved mats may be designed
which are simple in construction and effective in
training by providing a mat having a flight line for the
ball marked clearly on it generally near one edge, and
provided with one or more means to define a stance line
which can be adjusted both with respect to its distance
from the flight line and with respect to its angle.Accordingly the present invention provides apparatus for
teaching or correcting the stance of a golfer when
addressing a golf ball, including a mat covering an area
big enough to accommodate both feet of the golfer when
adopting an addressing

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for teaching or correcting the stance of a
golfer when addressing a golf ball, including a mat (2)

covering an area big enough to accommodate both feet of
the golfer when adopting an addressing stance, in which

the mat is marked with a ball line (4) of alternative
ball positions aligned with the intended line of flight

of a golf ball, and in which the line has associated with
it indicia indicating the positions along the line at

which a golf ball should be placed when it is to be
struck with a golf club of specified weight or number,

and in which the mat has means defining at least one
stance line (12, 14, 16) which is spaced from the ball

line and which subtends an acute angle with it.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, in which the mat
(2) is made in two parts which are adjustably secured

together, in which one part bears the ball line (4), and
in which the other part has at least one stance line (12,

14, 16) defined thereon.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, in which three
stance lines (12, 14, 16) are defined on the mat (2),

each at different distances from the ball line (4) and at
different angles thereto.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, in which the or
each stance line (12, 14, 16) is able to be detachably

secured to one surface of the mat (2), so as to extend
between pre-determined points thereon.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, in
which the ball locations on the ball line (4) which are 

to be used when the golfer is using a wood are
differentiated visually from those ball locations which

are to be used when the golfer is using irons.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, in which the
positions to be associated with the lower-numbered irons

are further differentiated visually from those associated
with the higher-numbered irons.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, or any claim
dependent therefrom, in which each stance line (12, 14,

16) has the same visual indications associated with it as
have the numbers associated with the ball locations for

the respective sub-set of clubs.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, in
which the ball line (4) extends across the shorter width

of a mat (2) having a base of rubber or like resilient
material, the ball line being visually distinguishable

from the rest of the area of the mat and from the or each
stance line.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, or any Claim
dependent therefrom, in which each strip defining a

stance line (12, 14, 16) has a backing layer of a
material which is able to be releasably fastened to a

surface layer of the mat by the application of force to
the exposed face of the strip.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, in
which the ball line (4) is traversed by a plurality of

sight lines (22) extending normally to the axis of the
ball line, the sight lines being visually distinguishable

from the ball line to act as a orientation guides for the 
heads of golf clubs.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 or any Claim
dependent therefrom, in which the mat (2) has in it a

longitudinal series of sockets (18) associated with each
stance line, and in which each stance strip has

projecting from one end thereof a stud (23) able to be
fitted in any socket to act as a pivot for the strip.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, in
which the region of the mat (2) on which a stance line is

to be adjustably positioned has attached to it a strip of
releasable fastening material able to be engaged by one

end of a stance strip, the fastening strip extending
substantially normal to the ball line.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 12, in which each
region has a pair of parallel strips of releasable

fastening material secured to it, so that each stance
strip may have its end secured at any location along the

length of the fastening strip so as to extend between the
pair of fastening strips at any chosen angle relative to

the axis of the ball line.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding
Claims, and further comprising a golf swing guide

apparatus having a base member (60) and a flexible
upstanding guide (64, 66), the guide being portionable

such that it lies above the surface of the mat and
extends from a planar section (64) positioned adjacent

the ball line remote from the user and substantially at
the position of the ball on the tee to an arcuate section

(66) which extends to cross the ball line so that its
free end lies between the feet of one user and the ball

line.
