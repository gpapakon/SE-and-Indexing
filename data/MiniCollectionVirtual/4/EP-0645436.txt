<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tetrakisazo 
compound and its use, and particularly, to an ink for an 
ink-jet printer containing the compound. An aqueous ink for ink-jet printing comprises 
basically a dye, an organic solvent and water. The ink has 
to satisfy various requirements for conducting satisfactory 
ink-jet printing. The properties of the ink, such as the 
viscosity, the surface tention, the relative conductivity, 
the specific density, and the pH , have to be in 
optimum ranges which vary depending on how to produce the 
ink-drops and how to control the direction of ink-drops. These properties have to be maintained for a long 
period of time. For this purpose, it is required that the ink 
be free from depositions while store for a long period, while 
conducting ink-jet printing for a long period or while 
leaving the ink composition in an ink jet printer without 
operating it for a long period of time. Since, the diameter 
of an ink-jet nozzle is usually about 10 - 60 µm, if 
deposition is caused, the nozzle is often clogged by the 
deposition and the ink drops can not be jetted from the 
nozzle. Even when the nozzle is not clogged completely, 
print quality, jet stability and jet response are often 
lowered due to a solid component or a sticky component 
sticking in the vicinity of the nozzle. It is also required that the ink can give clear 
recording images having sufficient contrast, water-durability  
 
and light-durability. The ink is also desired 
to give recording images which do not to cause blots when 
a mark is drawn over the images with a pen, such as a pen 
having a felt-made pen point and using an aqueous fluorescence 
ink. (Hereinafter this characteristic of the images is 
referred to as "blot resistance" and a pen having a felt-made 
pen point is referred to as "felt pen".) For ink-jet printers utilizing thermal energy 
recently developped, an ink having excellent thermal stability 
is required. Since the above-mentioned properties of the ink 
for ink-jet printing are greatly influenced by 
characteristics of the dye comprised in the ink, dyes which 
give the ink the above-mentioned desired properties have been 
desired. Hitherto, in order to improve the above-mentioned 
properties, trisazo compounds described in JP-A-63-105079 
("JP-A-" means Japanese unexamined patent 
publication, i.e. "Kokai") and tetrakissazo compounds 
described in JP-A-55-144069, JP-A-1-141966 or JP-B-61-18590 
("JP-B-" means Japanese examined patent publication i.e. " 
Kokoku") have been proposed,
