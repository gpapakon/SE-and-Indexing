<ABSTRACT>
In this plant for the cryogenic purification of hydrogen, using a cryogenic turbine (8) with gas bearings, the turbine is fed with the gas originating from its bearings (17) after cooling in a cryogenic heat-exchange line (3). The gas expanded in the turbine is mixed with the residual fraction of the plant in order to lower the partial pressure of the hydrocarbons and promote their vaporisation in the said heat-exchange line. Application to the purification of a catalytic cracking (reforming) gas for increasing the treatment capacity of hydrocarbon hydro-treatment reactors.

Process for the cryogenic purification of impure 
hydrogen, of the type in which impure hydrogen is cooled 

below a high pressure P0 to a sufficiently low temperature 
to condense a predetermined proportion of impurities, by 

heat exchange in a heat exchange line (3) with purified 
hydrogen and with a residual fraction containing the 

condensed impurities previously expanded (in 11, 12) to a 
low pressure P1, additional cooling power being provided by 

expanding purified hydrogen in a turbine (8) having gas 
bearings, comprising a wheel (14) connected to a shaft (15) 

which revolves in a stator (16) by means of gas bearings 
(17), the stator being supplied with a supporting gas, and 

a labyrinth (18) provided between the wheel and these 
bearings, and the expanded hydrogen being added to the 

impurities which are expanded at the cold end of the heat 
exchange line, characterized in that the turbine (8) is 

supplied with the supporting gas leaving the bearings (17) 
after cooling this gas in the heat exchange line, and a 

leaked flow of hydrogen is withdrawn from the labyrinth 
(18) of the turbine, under a pressure slightly less than 

the interstitial pressure Pi which exists between the wheel 

(14) and the stator (16) of this turbine. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the turbine (8) is additionally supplied by a flow of 

purified hydrogen expanded in an expansion valve (26). 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the leaked flow gas, possibly after expansion in an 

expansion valve (29), is added to the residual gas at 
ambient temperature. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the leaked flow of gas is added, after cooling and 

possible expansion, to the said residual expanded fraction.  
 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

bearings (17), and a labyrinth (18) provided between the 
wheel and these bearings, the stator being supplied by a 

supporting gas, means for circulating a flow of impure 
hydrogen in one direction in the heat exchange line, means 

for reducing the pressure of the liquid phase of the phase 
separator (7) to a low pressure, means for adding hydrogen 

at low pressure to the residual fraction resulting from 
this reduction in pressure, and means for circulating the 

mixture obtained at the low pressure counter-current to the 
impure hydrogen, characterized in that the heat exchange 

line comprises passages for cooling the supporting gas

passages being connected to the inlet of the turbine at the 
cold end of the heat exchange line, and in that the plant 

comprises means (28, 29) for withdrawing a leaked flow of
