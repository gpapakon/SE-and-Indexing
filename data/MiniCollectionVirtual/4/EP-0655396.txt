<ABSTRACT>
A spraying apparatus (10) for discharging the contents 
of a valve-equipped 

aerosol can comprising a tube (50) having a front and rear end, 
a front housing (40) fixed to one end of the tube which includes a 

holder for the aerosol can, and a rear housing (20) mounted on the other 
end of the tube which includes a grip and a trigger (80) which is able 

to reciprocate between a discharging position and non-discharging 
position, wherein the trigger, when in the discharging position, 

causes the aerosol can to discharge, whereby a locking land (130) is 
disposed within the rear housing for frictionally receiving a front 

surface 
(140) of the trigger when it is moved vertically from the discharging 

position, the biasing spring (102) biasing the trigger into engagement 
with the locking land and thus maintaining the trigger in the 

discharging position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for remotely 
supporting and actuating an aerosol container. Aerosol containers using a pressurized gas for 
dispensing various types of products are used in a variety 
of environments. Examples of such products include paints, 
insecticides, cleaning and lubricating compositions. 
Because of the pressure capacity of conventional spray cans 
is limited, the spray discharged from the can is typically 
only discharged through a limited distance. This often 
requires that the user of the can be positioned relatively 
close to the article or object which is to be sprayed. 
While this may suffice for in certain applications, it is 
very undesirable for others. For instance, when markings 
are being made on a road or sidewalk, it is very 
inconvenient for the user to have to bend down toward the 
road or sidewalk in order to produce a high quality and 
accurately-located mark. Moreover, if a spray can 
containing an insecticide is being used on a nest or hive  
 
of insects, it would be very undesirable to be in an area 
immediately adjacent to the hive while the insecticide is 
applied. Further, and in certain other situations, the 
contents of the can itself may be harmful if it comes in 
contact with human skin or is inhaled, this making a 
further case for locating the can remotely from the user 
upon discharge. In an effort to overcome the aforementioned problems, 
several devices have been devised which permit an aerosol 
can to be located at a remote distance from the user, and 
which allow for remote actuation of the spray can. 
Examples of such known devices are provided by U.S. Patents 
3,485,206, 3,977,570 which discloses a spraying apparatus according 
to the preamble of claim 1, 4,099,482 and 4,660,745. In using such devices, however, the hand of the 
operator may become fatigued from holding the trigger of 
the device in the actuating position (the position which 
causes discharge of the can contents) for an extended 
period. It would thus be desirable to provide a means by 
which this problem could be avoided. Moreover, as remote 
spraying devices are used for a variety of purposes, it 
would also be desirable to provide a means which, while 
having an extended spray feature, also includes normal 
triggering operation which permits intermittent discharging 
of the can contents, i.e., in relatively short bursts. Thus, there exists a need for an aerosol can holder 
which allows for the remote actuation of the can by a user 
for both an extended period, without

<CLAIMS>
A spraying apparatus (10) for discharging the contents of 
a valve-equipped aerosol can comprising: 


an elongated, hollow tube (30) having a front and rear end; 
a front housing (40) fixed to the tube (30) at the front end, the 
front housing (40) including a can holder (50) comprising a hollow cylinder (52) 

sized to receive an aerosol can; 
a bell crank (90) pivotally mounted in the front housing (40); 
a trigger rod (70) fixed to a first arm of the bell crank (90) 
for sliding longitudinal movement, such movement causing rotation 

of the bell crank (90); 
an actuator rod (60) fixed to a second arm of the bell crank (90) 
for longitudinal movement between a discharging position, wherein 

the actuator rod (60) moves the can valve, and a non-discharging 
position; 
a biasing spring (100), 
which biases the trigger rod (70) 

to a position where the actuator rod (60) is in the non-discharging 
position; 
a rear housing (20) mounted to the rear end of the tube (30), the 
rear housing (20) including a grip portion (22); 
a trigger (24) disposed within the rear housing (20) and 
connected to the trigger rod (70) for reciprocating longitudinal 

movement of the rod between a discharging position, wherein the actuator rod (60) 
is in the discharging position, and a non-discharging position;
 
and characterised in that; 
the biasing spring (100) is fixed between the trigger rod (70) and a retaining wall (102) 
in the front housing (40), and  

 
a locking land (130) is disposed within the rear housing (20) for 
frictionally receiving a front surface (140) of the trigger (24) when it is 

moved vertically from the discharging position, the biasing 
spring (100) biasing the trigger (24) into engagement with the locking land (130) 

and thus maintaining the trigger (24) in the discharging position. 
The spraying apparatus (10) of claim 1, wherein the locking 
land (130) comprises two projections from respective sidewalls of the 

rear housing (20), the land (130) including a gap between the two 
projections to allow clearance for the trigger rod (70). 
The spraying apparatus (10) of claim 1 or claim 2, further 
comprising a wheel (56) rotationally mounted on the can holder (50) which 

contacts the aerosol can and rotates when the can is inserted 
into the holder (50). 
The spraying apparatus (10) of any one of the preceding 
claims, further comprising a locker (120) rotationally mounted on the 

rear housing (20) and rotatable between a non-locking position wherein 
only horizontal movement of the trigger (24) is allowed, and a locking 

position wherein horizontal and vertical movement of the trigger (24) 
in the discharging position is allowed. 
The spraying apparatus (10) of claim 4, wherein the locker (120) 
is generally cylindrical and includes a flat face. 
The spraying apparatus (10) of claim 5, wherein the trigger 
rod (70) is disposed horizontally and includes a bend and a 

substantially vertically-extending portion beyond the bend, the  
 

substantially vertically-extending portion being fixed to the 
trigger (24), the bend contacting the cylindrical region of the locker (120) 

and preventing vertical movement of the trigger (24) when the locker (120) 
is in the non-locking position. 
The spraying apparatus (10) of claim 5, wherein when the 
flat face of the locker (120) is disposed horizontally in the locking 

position, the bend of the trigger rod (70) can now move vertically 
when the trigger (24) is in the discharging position. 
The spraying apparatus (10) of any one of claims 4 to 7, 
wherein a lock switch (26) is fixed to the locker (120) and is manually 

movable to selectively move the locker (120) between locking and non-locking 
positions.
