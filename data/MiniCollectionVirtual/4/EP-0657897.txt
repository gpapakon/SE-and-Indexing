<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a solid, thermoplastic
composition which is conductive to ions while being an
electrical insulator. More particularly, the composition
comprises a plasticised terpolymer of vinyl butyryl, vinyl
alcohol, and vinyl acetate and alkali metal salt.Liquid electrolytes have conventionally been used in
electrochromic devices, batteries, sensors, and capacitors.
Electrochromic devices comprise an assembly of parallel
layers of materials including electrodes and there between
an electrochromic material and an electrolyte. Upon
providing a current across the electrodes, the
electrochromic material changes colour. Such devices have
been suggested to moderate light transmittance in sunroofs
or windshields. When liquid electrolytes are employed in
electrochromic devices, there is the possibility of leakage
of the electrolyte out of the device, the inherent
difficulty of sealing the device, and the obvious lack of
mechanical strength and adhesion of the electrolyte layer to
the adjacent layer.Various solid electrolytes have been suggested for
use in electrochromic devices. Solid electrolytes of
complex halides are known, particularly iodides of silver
with an alkali metal. Additionally, solid electrolytes may
comprise aluminium compounds such as sodium beta-alumina and
potassium beta-alumina. However, these electrolytes are all
typically expensive to prepare and, in the case of the
alumina compounds, could not be formed directly on
components of an electrochromic device since they require
very high processing temperatures. Because of the rigidity
of solid materials, it is also difficult to assemble the
component layers of an electrochromic device and achieve the
intimate contact required between the solid electrolyte and
the adjacent layers, particularly if the surfaces of the
device are curved. Such problems are minimised with polymeric
electrolytes which are generally either extremely viscous
liquids or tacky solids. It would be desirable, however, if
the polymeric electrolytes were solids which could be formed
into self-supporting films with a degree of flexibility to
allow uncomplicated device fabrication.One approach to forming such a flexible solid
material involves copolymerisation of polyethylene oxide and
polypropylene oxide and results in systems having good
conductivity at room temperature, but a markedly reduced
ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Another approach to
the formation of room temperature flexible solid polymer
electrolytes includes forming materials having
