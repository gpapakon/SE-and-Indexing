<ABSTRACT>
The main characteristic of the described method consists in that the 
method utilises particular signals provided in said television signal so 

as to automatically certify that determined specific publicity messages 
have been transmitted, and that provides means for controlling the 

functioning of a receiving apparatus of television signals in function 
with the presence or not of said publicity insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a use of certification signals being included on a
determined active line of a television signal and a control circuit for identifying
publicity inserts according to such use.The insertion of publicity during television transmissions is somewhat disturbing,
particularly if one wishes to record a transmission (for example a film). In order to
avoid that the inserts are also recorded it is necessary to be present and provide for
stopping the recorder in connection with each insert and to restart it when the insert
has finished.Naturally this cannot be carried out in all the numerous cases in which the
transmission that one wishes to record is at an hour in which it is not possible to be
personally present, or if it takes place simultaneously with another transmission that
one wishes to see. In that case all the inserts are recorded and, if it is desired to remove them, it is
necessary to review the recording and provide to re-record it on another cassette,
removing the inserts; this however requires the availability of two separate recorders
or of a double deck recorder, and in any case the quality of the registration obtained
by re-recording is worse than that of the original tape.Systems which automatically detect the publicity inserts are known from GB-A-2210526
and US-A-4857999.GB-A-2210526 discloses an apparatus for controlling video or audio equipment which
can detect amongst other types of television programmes publicity inserts and can
switch channels temporarily during the publicity inserts and/or interrupt recording to
eliminate the publicity inserts. The detection of the type of each television programme
is effected on the basis of predetermined code signals contained in the transmitted
television signal alongside the normal television programme. The predetermined code
signals are transmitted at least at the start of every television programme segment or
publicity insert and may be transmitted continuously.US-A-4857999 discloses similar equipment as GB-A-2210526 to detect the presence
of specific programme material in a television signal such as a publicity insert. The
detection does not require the insertion of special identification signals or codes into
the television signal but uses the closed captioning (text) for the deaf signal that is
included in line 21 of the NTSC video signal and also in line 16 of the PAL signal. The problem is that the detection of publicity inserts by comparing closed captioning
(text) for the deaf signal with predetermined text

Method of using
certification signals being included on a determined active line of a

television signal, said certification signals being originally utilised for
automatically certifying that predetermined specific publicity inserts have been

transmitted at a certain time by said television signal, said method being such that the
presence or absence of certification signals is detected by means of a control

circuit operated to identify said determined active line in one of the first or last
active lines, wherein said certification signals are present on the identified active

line with a duration and a frequency which are correlated with said publicity
inserts, and wherein said method comprises controlling a receiving apparatus for

television signals in accordance with the detected presence or absence of said
certification signals.
Method according to claim 1, wherein the number of said determined active line is
introduced into said control circuit manually by service personal or by the user.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a simultaneous video and audio
modulation absence is detected and utilised together with the information of the

presence of said certification signals for controlling the functioning of said
receiving apparatus for television signals.
Control circuit for identifying publicity inserts according to the method as defined in
claim 3, 
characterised by
 means for implementing the following steps:

Detecting the simultaneous video and audio modulation absence for a
predetermined period; 
memorising the position (Cg) reached by a tachometer of a recorder used with
said receiving apparatus;
detecting the appearance, within a determined period, of a said digital certification
signal in s
aid determined active line of said television signal;
stopping the recorder and making it rewind to the memorised position of the
tachometer, and
restarting the recorder as soon as it has detected both the absence of said
digital certification signals in said television signal and a new simultaneous

video and audio modulation absence for said predetermined period.
Control circuit for identifying publicity inserts according to the method as defined in
claim 3, 
characterised by
 means for implementing the following steps:

Detecting the simultaneous video and audio modulation absence for a
predetermined period;
detecting the appearance, within a determined period, of a said digital certification
signal in said determined active line of said television signal ;
stopping a recorder used with said receiving apparatus, and
restarting the recorder as soon as is detected both the absence of said digital
certification signals in said television signal and a new simultaneous video and

audio modulation absence for said predetermined period.
Control circuit for identifying publicity inserts according to the method as defined in
any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by
 means for controlling the functioning of
said receiving apparatus for television signals by stopping a recording operation in

concomitance with the detected presence of said certification signal. 
Control circuit for identifying publicity inserts according to the method as defined in
any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by
 means for controlling the functioning of
said receiving apparatus by suppressing the audio during publicity inserts

identified by said detection of said certification signals.
Control circuit for identifying publicity inserts according to the method as defined in
any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by
 means for controlling the functioning of
said receiving apparatus by automatically changing over programs, tuning the

apparatus to another program previously memorised and returning to the first
program at the end of by the publicity insert in response to said detection of said

certification signals.
A system comprising a control circuit for identifying publicity inserts according to
claim 7 or 8, the system further comprising a video recorder for automatically

controlling the functioning of a television receiver in order to suppress the audio
or to change programs automatically during publicity inserts.
