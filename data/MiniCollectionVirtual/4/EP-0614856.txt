<ABSTRACT>
Incidence of breakage in optical fiber drawn from sol-gel produced 
preforms is reduced by treatment of the still-porous glass by use of a chlorine-containing, 

oxygen-free gas mixture. Improved satisfaction of proof-test 
requirements to at least 100 kpsi is assured by size reduction of unassimilated 

discrete particles in the fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with the fabrication of silica-based optical
fiber by drawing from preforms which include sol-gel produced glass. Early use will
take the form of low-loss single-mode fiber prepared from composite preforms
constituted of sol-gel produced overcladding tubes enclosing core rods prepared by
usual fiber fabrication processes.EP-A-0 583 943 falls within the terms of Article
54(3) EPC and represents the breakthrough to finally realize the economy implicit
in use of sol-gel prepared silica-based glass bodies. In one use, tubular bodies,
together with cores prepared by soot processing or by Modified Chemical Vapor
Deposition, make up the composite preforms from which optical fiber may be drawn.
That patent application describes incorporation of an organic polymer in the sol to
avoid cracking of the gelled body during drying. Polymer removal during firing
results in final drawn fiber of quality commensurate with that produced by more
expensive methods now in use. Near-net shape sol-gel bodies are expected to play a
role in optical fiber manufacture in the near future.EP-A-0 614 855,
which has the priority date 11.03.93 and thus does not
belong to the state of the art within the meaning of Art.54 EPC,
reports the finding that inclusion of small numbers of small "refractory"
particles in the sol-gel preform body prevents satisfaction of proof-test requirements
for the drawn fiber. 0.8 µm particles of zirconia or other particulate material which
does not dissolve into the silica at usual firing temperature, is found to cause
breakage in 6,80x108 Pa (100 kpsi) proof-testing. Manufacturing specifications require near-complete
avoidance - define an acceptable level as low as two such refractory
particles per megameter of fiber (10-10 gram/30 kg SiO2) or lower.The finding is of little relevance to usual procedures for preform
fabrication. Vapor transfer processes, whether by soot processing or by Modified
Chemical Vapor Deposition, avoid the problem of particle containment internal to
the glass. The sol-gel process which owes economic advantage to elimination of
need for vapor transfer is susceptible. Satisfactory particle elimination from starting
material, as by condensation from vapor, would eliminate this cost advantage. This co-filed application, generically directed to avoidance of this
problem peculiar to sol-gel, suggests centrifugation as an approach. Centrifugation
is effective, particularly for particles of major fractions of a micrometer and larger.
It is likely expected that

<CLAIMS>
Process for fabrication of optical fiber in accordance with which fiber
is drawn from a preform comprising a sol-gel derived glass body, in which the body

is prepared by gelation of a sol followed by drying to a porous body and finally by
sintering.

   CHARACTERIZED IN THAT the still-porous body is subjected to a
step in which the body is heated and maintained at elevated temperature at least of

400°C and below the sintering temperature, and is exposed to a flowing halogen-containing
gas mixture which is substantially free of oxygen, whereby refractory

particles react with the gas mixture to yield gaseous reaction product and thereby to
reduce particle size with consequent reduction in incidence of particle-nucleated

fiber breaks, and in which the gas mixture as introduced contains SOCl

Process of claim 1 in which fiber is drawn from a composite preform
and in which the sol-gel body serves as overcladding.
Process of claim 2 in which the body is a discrete overcladding tube
and in which the preform consists essentially of the tube and an enclosed core

section.
Process of claim 3 in which the composite preform consists essentially
of a core section prepared by a vapor transport process within such overcladding

tube.

Process of claim 9 in which the body contains at least 95 wt.% silica.
Process of claim 1 in which the gas mixture contains an inert carrier

Process of claim 1 in which the sol is subjected to a first particle-removal

Process of claim 1 in which the particle-removal step is preceded by
a prior elevated-temperature gas treatment step in which the body is heated and

maintained at elevated temperature, and is exposed to a flowing halogen-containing
gas mixture which differs in composition from that of the particle-removal step.
Process of claim 14 in which the prior gas treatment comprises
dehydroxylation.
