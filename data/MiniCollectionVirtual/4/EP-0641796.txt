<ABSTRACT>
A group of hydro-monobenzoporphyrins "green 
porphyrins" (Gp) having absorption maxima in the range 

of 670-780 nanometers is useful in treating disorders or 
conditions which are subject to hematoporphyrin 

derivative (HPD) treatment in the presence of light, or 
in treating virus, cells and tissues generally to 

destroy unwanted targets. The use of the Gp of the 
invention permits the irradiation to use wavelengths 

other than those absorbed by blood. The Gp of the 
invention may also be conjugated to ligands specific for 

receptor or to specific immunoglobulins or fragments 
thereof to target specific tissues or cells for the 

radiation treatment. Use of these materials permits 
lower levels of drug to be used, thus preventing side 

reactions which might destroy normal tissues.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of light
absorbing compounds to mediate the destruction of
unwanted cells or tissues or other undesirable materials
by irradiation. Specifically, the invention relates to
the use of hydro-monobenzoporphyrin derivatives having
absorption maxima in the range 670-780, for example 720-780,
nanometers to mediate the irradiation of materials to be destroyed,
and to the use of these compounds conjugated to
target-specific ligands, such receptor-specific ligands,
or immunoglobulins or their immunospecific fragments, to
focus the effects of the irradiation on particular
targets.The use of hematoporphyrin and its acetylated
derivative mixture hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD)
systemically, combined with irradiation, for the
detection and treatment of malignant cells has, by this 
time, some considerable history. HPD is a mixture of
porphyrins including hematoporphyrin itself,
hydroxyethyl vinyl deuteroporphyrin, protoporphyrin, and
dihematoporphyrin ethers. (See, e.g., "Porphyrin
Photosensitization", Kessel, D., et al, eds. (1983)
Plenum Press.)HPD seems "naturally" capable of localizing in
malignant cells. When irradiated, it has two properties
which make it useful. First, when irradiated with
ultraviolet or visible light, it is capable of
fluorescence, and thus is useful in diagnostic methods
related to detection of malignancy (see, for example,
Kessel, et al (supra); Gregory, H.B. Jr., et al, Ann
Surq (1968) 167:827-829). More pertinent to the present
invention is the capacity of HPD, when irradiated with
visible light, to exhibit a cytotoxic effect on the
cells in which it is localized (see, for example,
Diamond, I., et al, Lancet (1972) 2:1175-1177;
Dougherty, T.J., et al, Cancer Research (1978)
38:2628-2635; Dougherty, T.J., et al, "The Science of
Photo Medicine: (1982) J.D. Regan & J.A. Parrish, eds.,
pp. 625-638; Dougherty, T.J., et al, "Cancer:
Priniciples and Practice of Oncology" (1982) V.T. DeVita
Jr., et al, eds., pp. 1836-1844). Although it has not
been definitively established, the effect of HPD in
killing cells seems to be due to the formation of
singlet oxygen upon irradiation (Weishaupt, K.R., et al,
Cancer Research (1976) 36:2326-2329). Several
mechanisms for this effect have been proposed, and it
has recently been shown that the active ingredient in
HPD which mediates the cytotoxic effect of visible light
irradiation is the mixture of dihematoporphyrin ethers
(DHE) (Dougherty, T.J., et al, "Porphyrin Localization
and Treatment of Tumors" (1984) pp. 301-314;
