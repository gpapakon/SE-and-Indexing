<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to phosphor 
compositions for use in X-ray intensifying screens, and 
X-ray intensifying screens which utilize these 
phosphors. X-ray intensifying screens have in the past 
been used in combination with silver halide containing 
radiographic films to reduce the exposure of patients 
to X-rays. Intensifying screens typically consist of a 
support and a phosphor layer. The phosphor layer, 
which absorbs X-radiation more efficiently than the 
silver halide, is capable of emitting a longer 
wavelength radiation to the adjacent silver halide 
emulsion layer of the radiographic element in an image 
pattern corresponding to that of the X-radiation 
received. The efficiency of absorption of the X-radiation 
by the phosphor is dictated to some extent by 
the density of the phosphor crystals. Higher density 
phosphor combinations absorb radiation more efficiently 
than lighter compositions. One very popular phosphor 
composition, gadolinium oxy sulfide (Gd₂O₂S), has a 
density of 7.3 g/cm³. It would be desirable to develop 
a variety of useful phosphor host compounds having 
higher densities, since theoretically, for such 
phosphors thinner intensifying screens could be 
employed, resulting in increased resolution. Several such relatively high density 
luminescent compositions have been proposed. Titanium 
activated hafnium oxide, for example, which has a 
density of 9.7 g/cm³. Phosphor compositions of this 
type are described in US-A-4,988,880. There is, however, a continuing need for 
alternative high density phosphor compositions, as many 
phosphors seem to suffer from one disadvantage or  
 
another. For example, because the emission of 
conventional Ti-activated HfO₂ is centered at about 
475-480 nm, it is not well-matched to currently 
available blue or green-sensitive films. Consequently, 
in such cases, the silver halides, which normally 
possess native sensitivity to both the near ultraviolet 
and blue regions of the spectrum, must be sensitized to 
be sensitive to the green, red, and/or infrared 
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. There thus continues to be a need for 
economical phosphors exhibiting high density and 
luminescence intensity. Further, there is a continuing 
need for such phosphors which have peak emissions at 
wavelengths which differ from currently available 
phosphors, particularly compositions which have a peak 
emission at wavelengths which are substantially shorter 
than 480 nm. Phosphors of the present invention 
consist essentially of oxygen
