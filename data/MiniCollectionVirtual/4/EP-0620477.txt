<ABSTRACT>
A camera or a cartridge loading apparatus for a 
camera includes determination means (3), to move in 

response to a cartridge (1) being loaded, for determining 
whether the cartridge is unusable, supporting means for 

movably supporting the determination means, prevention 
means for preventing a movement of the determination 

means, the prevention means being provided independent 
from the supporting means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improvement of a film
cartridge loading apparatus for a camera.Generally, a film cartridge is known such that it
is loaded into a camera by feeding film from the
cartridge in which the film is completely stored.
However, in the camera using a cartridge of this type,
it may have been happened that an exposed film
cartridge was incorrectly loaded. Therefore, there is
also known a camera as disclosed in the U.S. Patent No.
4998123, the camera provides a lock-out mechanism in
order to eliminate the above-mentioned problem.The mechanism includes a lock-out lever which is
possible to rotate to a shaft and is biased by a spring
in the one side direction. With this kind of the
lock-out lever, if an exposed film cartridge is loaded
into the camera, the lock-out lever connects with the
cartridge to prevent the cartridge loading.On the other hand, when an unused film cartridge
is loaded, the lock-out lever resists such a spring to
avoid thereof, whereby the cartridge can be loaded into
the camera.However, in the conventional camera having the 
mechanism mentioned above, if a user incorrectly loads
an exposed or unusable film cartridge into a camera, on
the structure of the mechanism, an excessive power may
be given onto the lock-out lever and the shaft, thereby
requiring a higher rigidity of each component and
making the mechanism big. In US 5 122 820 a blocking member 211 is shown which is urged by
a helical compressing spring 215 to pivot clockwise about a
support pin 217 until a hook-like end 219 of the blocking member
protrudes into the loading chamber.The camera according to Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 16, no.
543 (P-1451), 12 November 1992 & JP-A-04 204 839 consist of an
accommodating chamber 4 which is to be loaded with a film
cartridge 3 and is then accommodated into a camera body 1 by
pushing the filled accommodating chamber to the right to come
into the chamber 23 of the camera body. The lock-out lever 15 is
moved downwardly with the movement of the film cartridge. If the
film cartridge is exposed the lower end of the detecting pin 13
of the lock-out lever is located at a position lower than the
inner wall 22 of the lower plate 21, the accommodation chamber
and, therefore, the film cartridge can not be inserted into the
chamber 23 of the camera body. Both, an exposed and,
furthermore, an unexposed cartridge according to D2 can be
inserted into the chamber until the bottom of the cartridge come
into contact with the bottom of the accommodating chamber. Only

<CLAIMS>
A film cartridge loading apparatus for loading film
cartridges having a mechanical indicator means indicating

whether the film is exposed or unexposed comprising:

determination means (3) including means (3a) which
upon loading the cartridge engage with the cartridge indicator

means for determining whether the cartridge (1) is exposed;
supporting means (6) for supporting said
determination means (3) and enabling movement of the latter;

the apparatus being 
characterized in that,
the determination means (3) includes means (3c) which upon the loading of the cartridge allows the determination means to vary its
state in accordance with whether the cartridge (1) is

exposed so as to move together with the cartridge, and in that
the apparatus (2, 8) and the determination means (3c, 3b, 3d)

are adapted to inhibit the loading of the exposed cartridge (1)
by preventing the further movement of said determination means (3)

while preventing said determination means (3) from exerting a
force on said supporting means (6).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
supporting means (6) includes means for rotatably supporting

said determination means (3).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
suppcrting means (6) includes means (3c) for slidably

supporting said determination means (3).
An apparatus according to claim 1, 2 and 3 further
comprising means (4) for urging said supporting means (6) in a

predetermined direction. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
prevention means includes a structure member of a camera.
A camera comprising a cartridge loading apparatus
according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 5.
