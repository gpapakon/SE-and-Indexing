<ABSTRACT>
NMR image data is acquired with velocity encoding 
gradients applied and both a phase difference image array 

and a complex difference image array are produced. A flow 
image is produced from the complex difference image array 

after it is corrected for spin saturation effects and 
calibrated using information derived from the phase 

difference image array. Total blood flow through vessels 
can be measured from the flow image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is nuclear magnetic 
resonance imaging methods and systems. More particularly, 
the invention relates to the measurement of blood flow using 
magnetic resonance imaging. Any nucleus which possesses a magnetic moment attempts 
to align itself with the direction of the magnetic field in 
which it is located. In doing so, however, the nucleus 
precesses around this direction at a characteristic angular 
frequency (Larmor frequency) which is dependent on the 
strength of the magnetic field and on the properties of the 
specific nuclear species (the magnetogyric constant γ of the 
nucleus). Nuclei which exhibit this phenomena are referred 
to herein as "spins". When a substance such as human tissue is subjected to a 
uniform magnetic field (polarizing field B₀), the individual 
magnetic moments of the spins in the tissue attempt to align 
with this polarizing field, but precess about it in random 
order at their characteristic Larmor frequency. A net 
magnetic moment Mz is produced in the direction of the 
polarizing field, but the randomly oriented magnetic 
components in the perpendicular, or transverse, plane (x-y 
plane) cancel one another. If, however, the substance, or 
tissue, is subjected to a magnetic field (excitation field 
B₁) which is in the x-y plane and which is near the Larmor 
frequency, the net aligned moment, Mz, may be rotated, or 
"tipped", into the x-y plane to produce a net transverse 
magnetic moment Mt, which is rotating, or spinning, in the 
xy plane at the Larmor frequency. The practical value of 
this phenomenon resides in the signal which is emitted by 
the excited spins after the excitation signal B₁ is 
terminated. There are a wide variety of measurement  
 
sequences in which this nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") 
phenomena is exploited. When utilizing NMR to produce images, a technique is 
employed to obtain NMR signals from specific locations in 
the subject. Typically, the region which is to be imaged 
(region of interest) is scanned by a sequence of NMR 
measurement cycles which vary according to the particular 
localization method being used. The resulting set of 
received NMR signals are digitized and processed to 
reconstruct the image using one of many well known 
reconstruction techniques. To perform such a scan, it is, 
of course, necessary to elicit NMR signals from specific 
locations in the subject. This is accomplished by employing 
magnetic fields (Gx, Gy, and Gz) which have the same 
direction as the polarizing field B₀, but which

A magnetic resonance imaging method comprising the steps 
of acquiring NMR data from a subject and reconstructing an 

image from the data, 
characterized by: 


a) acquiring two NMR data sets (303) from which two 
separate images are reconstructed, the two NMR data sets 

being acquired with different velocity encoding magnetic 
field gradients (310, 311; 312, 313) applied to the subject; 
b) producing (201)a phase difference array by calculating 
the phase of each value in the two NMR data sets and 

calculating the difference between the phases of corresponding 
values in each of the two NMR data sets
; 
c) producing (200) a complex difference array by 
calculating the square root of the sum of the squares of the 

differences between corresponding real values in the two NMR 
data sets and the differences between corresponding 

quadrature values in the two NMR data sets; 
d) correcting (204) the complex difference array for 
saturation effects using velocity information derived from 

the phase difference array; and 
e) producing (209) a flow image from the corrected 
complex difference array.

includes: 

   producing (205) a calibration factor from information 
derived from locations in the phase difference array and 

information derived from corresponding locations in the 
complex difference array, and calibrating (206) the entire 

complex difference array with the calibration factor. 
The method as recited in claim 1 or 2 which also includes: 

f) producing (207) a sign mask from the phase difference 
array which indicates the direction of flow at each location 

therein, and applying (208) the sign mask to add flow 
direction information to the flow image. 
The method as recited in any one of the preceding claims 
in which step d) includes: 

   producing (202) a velocity array from the phase difference 
array by dividing the values in the phase difference array 

with a constant value; 
   producing (203) a saturation correction array using values 

in the velocity array to determine the longitudinal 
magnetization available at corresponding array locations; and 

   correcting (204) the values in the complex difference 
array with corresponding values in the saturation correction 

array. 
The method as recited in claim 2 in which the calibration 
factor is produced by: 

   producing (205) a calibration array by taking the sine of 
one half the corresponding value in the phase difference 

array; 
   calculating (205) the calibration factor as the mean value 

of the ratio of selected values in the complex difference 
array over the corresponding value in the calibration array.
