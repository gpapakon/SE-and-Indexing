<ABSTRACT>
A method for influencing biological material is described. The intention is to influence those properties which correlate with the occurrence of natural pulse radiation (atmospherics), namely the rate of proliferation of C6 glioma cells and the survival time of Yoshida ascites hepatoma rats. For this purpose, signals which represent the time course of the magnetic field of certain natural pulse radiation and which are identified on the basis of distinct frequency portions, e.g. 10 kHz, are stored. Corresponding magnetic field courses are reproduced from these signals as artificial pulse radiation. Reproduction takes place, for example, in a Helmholtz coil. The biological material is exposed to this magnetic field.
