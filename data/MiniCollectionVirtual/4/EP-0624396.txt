<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process and a plant for the pressure relief of reactors in which, in a first step, by emergency depressurisation of the reactor a mass stream is released and this is passed via a pipe to a receiving vessel in which direct condensation of the mass stream containing gas and vapour portions is carried out in a cooling medium by means of jet condensers. The procedure according to the invention is that the mass stream exiting from the reactor (10) in the emergency depressurisation is passed as a heterogeneous vapour/gas/liquid mixture directly via pipes (12, 15, 16) to a receiving vessel (13) and is there condensed directly in a cooling medium (14) via jet condensers (17a, 17b, 20a, 20b) without previous separation of the liquid phase.

Process for the pressure relief of reactors in which in 
a first step a current of substances is released by an 

emergency pressure reduction of the reactor which is 
passed via a pipeline to a collecting vessel in which 

a direct condensation of the current of substances containing 
gas and steam portions takes place in a coolant by means 

of jet condensers, characterised in that the current of 
substances leaving the reactor (10) at the emergency pressure 

reduction is passed as a heterogeneous steam/gas/liquid 
mixture directly via pipelines (12, 15, 16) to a collecting 

vessel (13) and there condenses directly without previous 
separation of the liquid phase by means of jet condensers 

(17a, 17b, 20a, 20b) in a coolant (14). 
Process for the pressure relief of reactors as claimed 
in claim 1, characterised in that the current of substances 

leaving the emergency pressure reduced reactor (10) is 
split and a part thereof is condensed via a branch 

pipe (16) and external jet condensers (17a, 17b) positioned 

laterally outside of the collecting vessel (13), whereas 
a further part of the current of substances is passed via 

a pipeline (15) to the collecting vessel and is condensed 
there by means of internal jet condensers (20a, 20b) positioned 

in the collecting vessel (13) in the coolant (14). 
Process for the pressure relief of reactors as claimed 
in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in the collecting 

vessel (13) there is a pressure above atmospheric pressure. 
Process for the pressure relief of reactors as claimed 
in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 

excess pressure in the collecting vessel (13) is built 
up at the emergency pressure reduction.  

 
Process for the pressure relief of reactors as claimed 
in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that water 

serves as a coolant which contains additives as antifreezing 
agents, reaction stoppers and the like if necessary. 
Apparatus for the pressure relief of reactors which comprise 
an emergency pressure reduction device connected 

via a pipeline to a collecting vessel containing a coolant, 
jet condensers being provided at or in the collecting vessel 

which cause a direct condensation of the current of substances 
leaving the reactor and containing gas and steam 

portions, characterised in that the reactor (10) pressure 
relieved by the emergency pressure reduction device (11) 

is connected directly via a pipeline (12, 15, 16) to the 
jet condensers (17a, 17b, 20a, 20b) of the collecting vessel 

(13) containing a liquid coolant (14) so that the direct 
condensation of a heterogeneous steam/gas/liquid mixture 

is effected in the collecting vessel. 
Apparatus for the pressure relief of reactors as claimed 
in claim 6, characterised in that the pipeline (12) coming 

from the emergency pressure reduction device (11) forms 
branches, namely on the one hand a pipeline (15) leading 

into the collecting vessel (13) and being connected to 
internal jet condensers (20a, 20b) arranged in the collecting 

vessel in the coolant (14), and, on the other hand, a 
branch pipe (16) connected to external jet condensers 

(17a, 17b) positioned outside at the collecting vessel (13), 
the coolant also reaching the external jet condensers (17a, 

17b), the outlet opening (27) of the mixing nozzle (26) 
of which being connected to the vessel interior of the 

collecting vessel (13).
