<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a carrier for use by a person to carry a load which is to be carried in an essentially horizontal condition, the carrier being shaped so that in use, it provides a base for supporting the base of the load and a carrying handle (9) or loop which is located, in use, essentially centrally above the load, the carrier being in the form of a bag (1) which is sufficiently large at its lower end to accommodate the load to be carried in its essentially horizontal condition, the bag being provided with holes or cut-out portions (5) dimensioned and positioned so as to receive the corners or other projecting portions of the load, thereby to stabilize the load in its essentially horizontal condition. The invention also provides a method for making such a carrier, from an existing carrier bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to load carrying devices and in 
particular to carrying devices for use by individuals 
wishing to convey articles which need to be carried in a 
particular orientation. More specifically, the invention 
relates to such carrying devices for conveying articles 
which are of substantially rectangular shape. A particular example of an article which has to be carried 
in a particular orientation is a box containing a take-away 
pizza. Such a box should be carried so that the pizza is 
maintained in a substantially horizontal orientation. The 
box is typically square in plan and of a small depth 
sufficient to accommodate the thickness of the pizza. 
Currently it is a normal practice for one or more such 
take-away pizza packages to be carried directly by the 
purchaser, simply because it would not be possible to carry 
these articles in a conventional carrier-bag while 
maintaining the boxes in a horizontal condition. In order 
to carry one or more boxes directly, it is normally 
necessary for the purchaser to use both hands in order to 
hold the conveyed material securely in its proper 
orientation. Accordingly the purchaser has no hand free in 
order to carry other articles such as a carrier-bag full of 
shopping, a briefcase or an umbrella. US patent no. 1456897 discloses a paper carrier bag in 
which a number of horizontal support inserts made of 
relatively stiff material are provided. The support 
inserts are rectangular and include at each corner a 
projecting lug which engages a small hole at the 
corresponding height above the bottom of the bag. The bag 
itself retains its substantially rectangular shape in use 
and the inserts include apertures cut in them to support 
ice-cream cones and the like.  
 According to the present invention there is provided a 
carrier for use by a person to carry a load which is to be 
carried in an essentially horizontal condition, the carrier 
being shaped so that, in use, it provides a support for the 
load and a carrying handle or loop which is located 
essentially centrally above the load, the carrier being in 
the form of a bag of sufficient size at its lower end to 
accommodate a load to be carried in its essentially 
horizontal condition, the bag additionally being provided 
with holes or cut-out portions or perforation lines which, 
when ruptured, provide holes or cut-out portions, the holes 
or cut-out portions being dimensioned and positioned so as 
to receive the corners or other projecting portions of the 
load, characterised in that

<CLAIMS>
A carrier (1) for use by a person to carry a load (3) 
which is to be carried in an essentially horizontal 

condition, the carrier being shaped so that, in use, 
it provides a support for the load and a carrying 

handle or loop (9) which is located essentially 
centrally above the load, the carrier being in the 

form of a bag (1) of sufficient size at its lower end 
to accommodate a load (3) to be carried in its 

essentially horizontal condition, the bag additionally 
being provided with holes or cut-out portions (47) or 

perforation lines (49, 57) which, when ruptured, 
provide holes or cut-out portions, the holes or cut-out 

portions being dimensioned and positioned so as to 
receive the corners (7, 27) or other projecting 

portions of the load, 
characterised in that
 the holes 
or cut-out portions (47) originate at a position 

between the handle or loop and the base of the bag and 
extend, in use, to the base of the bag, thereby 

allowing the base of the bag to support the base of 
the load to stabilize the load in its essentially 

horizontal condition. 
A carrier according to Claim 1, adapted for use in 
carrying a load (3) which is, in plan, of 

substantially rectangular shape. 
A carrier according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, comprising 
both holes or cut-out portions (47) and appropriately 

dimensioned and positioned perforation lines (49) 
which, when ruptured, provide further holes which may 

receive corners or other projecting portions of a load 
carried in the carrier. 
A carrier according to any one of the preceding 
claims, having a hole or cut-out portion (47) at each 

of four of its corners, so as to receive the four 
corners (7) of a substantially rectangular load.  

 
A carrier according to any one of the preceding 
claims, additionally comprising an intermediate load 

structure (21, 31) which is dimensioned so as to fit 
into the base of the carrier in use and provide a 

support for other articles to be carried using the 
carrier. 
A carrier according to Claim 5, wherein the 
intermediate load structure is in the form of a 

relatively rigid box (21, 31). 
A carrier according to Claim 5, wherein the 
intermediate load structure is in the form of a 

relatively rigid rectangular sheet, which sheet 
provides a surface onto which articles may be loaded 

for carrying using the carrier. 
A carrier according to Claim 5, wherein the 
intermediate load structure comprises a stack of 

relatively rigid sheets, each sheet being spaced from 
adjacent sheets by means of one or more spacing 

elements. 
A method of producing a carrier (1) for use by a 
person to carry a load (3) which is to be carried in 

an essentially horizontal condition, the method 
comprising the steps of providing in an existing 

carrier bag appropriately positioned and dimensioned 
holes or cut-out portions (47) or perforation lines 

(47, 57) which, when ruptured, provide holes or cut-out 
portions, the holes or cut-out portions being 

adapted, in use, to receive the corners (7) or other 
projecting portions of a load being carried using the 

carrier, 
characterised in that
 the holes or cut-out 
portions (47) originate at a position between the 

carrying handle or loop (9) of the bag and the base of 
the bag and extend to the base of the bag.  

 
A method according to Claim 9, wherein the carrier bag 
is provided with holes or cut-out portions (47) and 

with appropriately dimensioned and positioned 
perforation lines (49) which, when ruptured, provide 

further holes which may receive corners (7) or other 
projecting portions of a load carried in the carrier.
