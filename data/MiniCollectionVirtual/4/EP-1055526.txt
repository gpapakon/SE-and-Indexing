<ABSTRACT>
A wheel with a damper for an automobile includes a rim (10), a disk (20),
and a damper (30). The damper (30) includes a rubber member (33). The rubber

member (33) includes a first portion (33a, 33b) and a second portion (33c). The
first portion (33a, 33b) performs mainly an elastic shear deflection and the second

portion (33c) acts as a stopper. The first portion (33a, 33b) extends in an axial
directio
n of the wheel and has an inside surface and an outside surface which
contact a space and are not constrained. The end surfaces of the first portion

(33a, 33b) extend perpendicularly to the axial direction of the wheel. A
vibrational system having a spring of the first portion (33a, 33b) of the rubber

member (33) and a mass of an automobile is designed so as to have a first natural
frequency in a range of 6 - 12 Hz, preferably, in a range of 8 - 10 Hz.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel with a damper for an automobile
and the manufacturing method therefor.In recent years, improving automobile fuel economy is important from the
standpoint of protecting the global environment, and decreasing tire rolling
resistance is strongly demanded. Among various resistance decreasing means,
means for suppressing energy loss due to deformation of the side wall portion of
the tire is effective. Accordingly, adoption of a highly pressurized tire and a
low-profile tire which is low in height and has a small differential between an
inside diameter and an outside diameter is increasing.However, there are the following problems associated with a tire which is
suppressed in deformation at the side wall portion, because a role a normal tire
plays in suppressing a vibration transmission from a road to an automobile body
decreases:
1 ○ Ride quality lowers to cause a so-called bumpy feeling. The reason is that
vibration in a vertical direction in the range of 10 Hz or higher is damped only a
little compared with the case of a normal tire.
With an automobile mounted with a normal tire, vibration in the range of
10 - 12 Hz or higher is absorbed or damped by the tire, and vibration lower than
10 - 12 Hz including a floating and tilting feeling of the range of 5 Hz or less
and vibrating feeling of the range of 5 - 12 Hz is absorbed or damped by a
suspension system. However, with the highly pressurized tire and the low-profile
tire, since the stiffness of the tire in the vertical direction increases, vibration in
the range 10 - 30 Hz is slightly damped. Japanese Patent Publication HEI 5-338401 proposes a wheel where a
vibration insulating rubber is disposed between a rim and a disk. In the proposed
wheel, the rubber acts as a vibrational barrier for insulating vibration due to the
viscosity or viscous elasticity of the rubber, and therefore, the rubber does not act
as a spring damper. Further, the rubber acts in compression and has too high
spring constant to effectively damp the above-described bumpy feeling. With
almost all of the other proposed wheels having a vibration insulating rubber
disposed between a rim and a disk, the rubber is intended to act in compression
and is too hard to effectively damp the bumpy feeling.2 ○ For the same reason as above, road noise (a noise hearing as "zaa" when a
automobile runs on the road) increases. A vibration generated due to the road
surface is transmitted to the body and vibrates the body panel to generate the road
noise. Though the
