<DESCRIPTION>
 NEURONAL STEM CELL GENEThe present invention relates to a method of marking, selecting and generating neuronal stem sells from tissues. In particular, the invention relates to the use of the Soxl gene for the generation of neuroblasts.SOX proteins constitute a family of transcription factors related to the mammalian testis determining factor SRY through homology within their HMG box DNA binding domains. In DNA binding studies, SOX proteins exhibit sequence specific binding; however, unlike most transcription factors, binding occurs in the minor groove resulting in the induction of a dramatic bend within the DNA helix. SOX proteins can induce transcription of reporter constructs in vitro and display properties of both classical transcription factors and architectural components of chromatin (reviewed by Peveny and Lovell-Badge (1997) Curr. Opin. Genetics and Development, 7:338-344).Members of the Sox gene family are expressed in a variety of embryonic and adult tissues, where they appear to be responsible for the development and/or elaboration of particular cell lineages. Sry is transiently expressed in the precursor Sertoli cells of the XY genital ridge and is responsible for triggering development of the male phenotype (reviewed by Lovell-Badge and Hacker, (1995) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 350:205-214). Thus, the lack of Sry results in XY females and XX males. Sox9 is expressed in immature chondrocytes and male gonads; mutations in the human SOX9 gene are associated with Campomelic Dysplasia, a human skeletal malformation syndrome, and XY female sex reversal. Sox4 is expressed in many tissues and a null mutation of the gene in mouse results in the absence of mature B cells and heart malformations. XsÎ±x 7 genes are involved in endoderm formation in Xenopus embryos. These functional analyses Suggest that Sox genes function in cell fate decisions in diverse developmental pathways. 

A subfamily of Sox genes, that includes Soxl, Sox2 and Sox3, shows expression profiles during vertebrate embryogenesis that suggest the genes could function in the control of cell fate decisions within the early developing nervous system. Sox2 and Sox3 begin to be expressed at pre implantation and epiblast stages respectively, and are then restricted to the neuroepithelium. Soxl appears only at around the stage of neural induction.The molecular mechanisms controlling neural induction and determination have begun to be elucidated. The identification by cellular and biochemical methods, of secreted molecules involved in
