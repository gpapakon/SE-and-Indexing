<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a ready-to-inject aqueous solution of a water-soluble, physiologically tolerated azosemide salt of an organic amide, the solution containing an organic solvent and optionally a physiologically tolerated buffer. The invention also concerns a method of preparing such an injection solution, the method calling for the salt to be dissolved in a mixture containing water, an organic solvent and optionally a physiologically tolerated buffer.

<CLAIMS>
A ready-to-inject aqueous injection solution of a 
Water-soluble, physiologically well-tolerated salt 

of azosemide which contains an organic solvent, 
wherein it contains at least one azosemide salt of 

an organic amine and optionally a physiologically 
well-tolerated buffer. 
Injection solution as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
it contains the meglumine (N-methyl-glucosamine)azosemide 

and/or triethanolamine-azosemide salt. 
Injection solution as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
the solvent is selected from the group propylene 

glycol, polyethylene glycol and ethanol and is 
preferably used at a concentration of 5 to 25 % by 

weight. 
Injection solution as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 3, wherein the buffer is selected from the 

group sodium carbonate, arginine sodium phosphate, 
N-methylglucosamine and Trometamol. 
Injection solution as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 4, wherein its pH value is 
>
 7. 
Injection solution as claimed in one of the claims 
1 to 5, wherein the titration basicity is at most 

about 0.3 mmol HCl/ml injection solution.  
 
Injection solution as claimed in claim 5 or 6, 
wherein the pH value is between 8.9 and 10.3, the 

solution contains a physiologically well-tolerated, 
alkaline buffer and the titration basicity is 

between 0.001 and 0.06 mmol HCl/ml injection 
solution. 
Process for the production of a ready-to-inject, 
aqueous injection solution which contains at least 

one water-soluble, physiologically well-tolerated 
salt of azosemide, in particular as claimed in one 

of the claims 1 to 7, wherein the salt is dissolved 
in a mixture which contains water, an organic 

solvent and optionally a physiologically well-tolerated 
buffer. 
Process as claimed in claim 8, wherein salt formers 
for producing azosemide salts and optionally a 

physiologically well-tolerated buffer are dissolved 
in a mixture containing water and an organic 

solvent and azosemide is suspended and dissolved 
with salt formation and the pH value is adjusted to 

a defined value. 
Process as claimed in claim 8 or 9, wherein the 
buffer capacity in the solution is adjusted to a 

maximum of 0.1 mmol HCl/ml injection solution and 
preferably to a maximum of 0.03 mmol HCl/ml 

injection solution. 
Process as claimed in one of the claims 8 to 10, 
wherein the solution is sterile filtered, filled 

into ampoules and preferably sterilized for 
20 minutes at 121Â°C.  

 
Process as claimed in one of the claims 8 to 10, 
wherein the active substance is lyophilised in an 

alkaline solution and the lyophilisate is dissolved 
in a mixture which contains an organic solvent and 

a surfactant apart from water for injection 
purposes.
