<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
determining rotational speed, magnitude and instantaneous 
direction of a residual flux of an inverter-supplied 
squirrel cage induction machine, to be used for 
starting the squirrel cage induction machine when 
there exists a rotating residual flux in the machine 
and a total leakage inductance of the machine is 
known. The method of the invention can be used for 
instance for inverter drives, in which a restarting 
command can turn up after the operation has been 
stopped, before the flux of the squirrel cage induction 
machine has disappeared. The invention can further 
be used for a quick recovery from disturbances, 
such as mains interruption or inverter overcurrent 
release. The method can also be used when a squirrel 
cage induction motor is connected from a mains supply 
to an inverter. EP Patent 469 177 discloses a method according 
to the prior art, by which a squirrel cage induction 
machine is started in a situation when there exists a 
rotating residual flux in the machine. In the method 
described in this publication, the computing time is 
at least twice the period of a basic cycle of the 
residual flux, and after the rotation has been measured, 
a magnetization current of the squirrel cage 
induction machine shall be raised to the nominal 
value before changing over to a controlled operation. 
Accordingly, the starting provided by this method is 
relatively slow and a direct change-over to a controlled 
supply of the squirrel cage induction machine 
is not possible at this starting.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide 
a method by means of which the residual flux 
rotating in the squirrel cage induction machine can 
be determined in such a way that a voltage feed to 
the motor, synchronized with a residual magnetic flux 
therein, can begin immediately after the determination 
of the flux. The method must not be dependent on 
how the rotating flux has been generated in the 
squirrel cage induction machine before the machine is 
started by inverter supply. The object of controlling an asynchronous 
machine is generally to cause a desired behaviour of 
a moment generated by the machine, when the current 
and the voltage fed to the machine are known. The 
purpose is then to influence the electric moment, the 
relative value of which as a function of a stator 
flux and current is: 
Tm = c( ψs x is)  
where: 
Tm =electric moment, c =constant coefficient, Ψs =stator flux, and is =stator current. Consequently, a controlled moment
