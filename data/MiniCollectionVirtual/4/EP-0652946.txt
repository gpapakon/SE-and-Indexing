<ABSTRACT>
Modified lipases are disclosed whereby at least the methionine at a position corresponding to position 21 in wild-type Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes lipase is substituted by another amino acid, which lipases exhibit a desired property change, in particular improved wash performance. Preferred embodiments are substitutions of said methionine by leucine, serine or alanine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to modified lipases
and to their use in, for example, detergents or cleaning
compositions.Lipases are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing lipids,
they are utilized in a wide range of applications such as fats
and oil processing, detergents, diagnostic reagents etc.Extracellular lipases (triacylglycerol acylhydrolases,
E.C. 3.1.1.3) are produced by a wide variety of microorganisms.
Suitable microbial lipases have for example been
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,950,277. These lipases were
obtained from such diverse microorganisms as Pseudomonas,
Aspergillus, Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Mycotorulalipolytica and Sclerotinia.Examples of the use of lipase in detergent
compositions are given in, e.g., EP 463100 (Pseudomonas alcaligenes),
EP 0218272 (Pseudomonaspseudoalcaligenes), EP 0214761
(Pseudomonascepacia)), EP 0258068 (Thermomyces), EP 206390
(Pseudomonaschromobacter, Pseudomonasfluorescens, Pseudomonas
fragi, Pseudomonasnitroreducens, Pseudomonasgladioli and
Chromobacterviscosum).Pseudomonas lipases in particular appear to have
favorable characteristics for desired applications. Pseudomonas
species therefore have been extensively used for obtaining
lipases. To increase lipase yield in fermentation several
lipase genes have been cloned and expressed in both homologous
and heterologous host strains. Examples of Pseudomonas species
from which lipase gene cloning has been reported are Pseudomonascepacia (EP 331376), Pseudomonasglumae (EP 464922),
Pseudomonaspseudoalcaligenes (EP 334462), Pseudomonasfragi
(EP 318775). The classification of Pseudomonas species is based
on DNA-rRNA and DNA-DNA hybridization studies as reported by
Palleroni etal., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 23:333 (1973). A
more extensive overview can be found in Bergey's Manual of
Systematic Bacteriology (Vol. 1, Section 4, pp. 160-161 (1984),
Eds N.R. Krieg and J.G. Holt, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore/London).
This overview also reports that the classification is
supported by morphological data and by 16S ribosomal RNA
homology.The described Pseudomonas strains, with favorable
application characteristics, can be divided into two DNA
homology groups. Pseudomonaspseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas
alcaligenes, Pseudomonasaeruginosa (see e.g. EP 0334462),
Pseudomonasstutzeri and Pseudomonasmendocina are closely
related and belong to Group I. For example, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa lipase has 81% homology with Pseudomonaspseudoalcaligenes
lipase. Pseudomonasglumae and Pseudomonascepacia
belong to
