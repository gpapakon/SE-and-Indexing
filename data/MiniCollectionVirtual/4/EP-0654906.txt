<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor device comprising on a semiconductor 
substrate (41) first and second input buffers (21), first and 

second input signal connections (25) supplying the input buffers 
from input signal pads (23) with input signals, respectively, 

each with a buffer input level, and first and second reference 
signal connections (29) supplying a reference signal from a reference 

signal pad (27) to the input buffers with buffer reference levels, 
respectively, a grounding pad (71) is laid near the reference 

signal pad and supplied with a ground level for the semiconductor 
device with a capacitor (73) connected between the semiconductor 

substrate and each reference signal connection near the reference 
signal pad and preferably with the reference signal connections 

laid geometrically parallel to the input signal connections. 
If lengthy, each reference signal connection comprises a first 

part laid parallel to a pertinent one of the input signal connections 
between a relevant one of the input buffers and a node (69) and 

a second part extended from the node to the reference signal 
pad. Each input buffer can produce an output signal of a CMOS 

level when each input sginal connection is supplied with a relevant 
one of the input signals with a TTL level. Preferably, each 

input buffer comprises a current mirror circuit for cancelling 
a variation in the buffer input signal and a variation in a relevant 

one of the buffer reference level with each other. The capacitor 
has a capacitance given by a gate capacitance of an MOS transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device which
comprises an input buffer supplied with an input signal of an
input level, such as a transistor/transistor logic (TTL) level,
and a reference signal of a reference level to produce an output
signal of an output level, such as a complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) logic level, for use in the semiconductor
device.A complementary metal-oxide semiconductor device is
suitable for large scale integration (LSI) and is therefore widely
used in integrated semiconductor circuits (IC). Such complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor devices are supplied with input signals
which usually have the transistor/transistor logic level, On
the other hand, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor logic
level is used in the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
devices, As a consequence, an input/output (I/O) interface is
used in converting the transistor/transistor logic level to the
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor logic level. The input
buffer is used as the input/output interface and is designed
to convert the transistor/transistor logic level to the complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor logic level by comparing the transistor/transistor
logic level with the reference level. In the manner which will later be described in greater
detail, a conventional semiconductor device of this type comprises
on its semiconductor substrate an input buffer, an input signal
pad supplied with an input signal of a source input level, such
as the transistor/transistor logic level, an input signal connection
for delivering the input signal to the input buffer, a reference
signal pad supplied with a reference signal of a source reference
level, and a reference signal connection for delivering the reference
signal to the input buffer, Supplied with the input and the
reference signals in this manner with a buffer input level and
a buffer reference level, the input buffer compares the buffer
input and reference levels with each other and produces an output
signal with an output level, such as the complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor logic level.Each of the input and the reference signal connections
has a parasitic resistance and a parasitic capacitance. The
buffer input and reference levels are consequently different
from the source input and reference levels, This gives rise
to an objectionable delay in operation of the input buffer, particularly
when noise is superimposed on the input and/or the reference
signal connection.In order to cope with the delay, an
