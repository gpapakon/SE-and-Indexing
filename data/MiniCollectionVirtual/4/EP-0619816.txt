<DESCRIPTION>
A PROCESS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF ( + -)-α-[2-[ACETYL(l-METHYLETHYL)AMINO]ETHYL]-α- (2-CHLOROPHENYL)-l-PIPERIDINEBUTANAMIDE(±)~c.~[2-[Acetyl(1-methylethyl)a ino)ethyl] -a-(2- chlorophenyl)-l-piperidinebutanamide which is a racemic mixture is useful by virtue of its ability to inhibit ventricular arrhythmia. A complete discussion of (±)α- [2-[acetyl(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl] -a-(2- chlorophenyl)-l-piperidinebutanamide usefulness as an antiarrhythmic agent is given in United States Patent 4,639,524. Given its potential usefulness as a pharmacological agent, it became desirable to develop a convenient and cost effective process for its resolution.Background of the InventionIngersoll, J. Am. Chem. Soc. (47) , 1168-1173 (1925) discusses a method for the resolution of externally compensated acids and bases by which both active forms are obtained completely pure. This method utilizes stereospecific camphorsulfonic acid.Ingersoll, J. Am. Chem. Soc. (50) , 2264-2267 (1928) discusses the resolution of inactive iso- diphenylhydroxy-ethylamine with d and dl-camphor sulfonic acids. 
Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a convenient and cost e fective manufacturing process for the resolution of (±)-α-[2-[acetyl(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl]-α-(2- chlorophenyl)-l-piperidinebutanamide into its two enantiomers[+]-α-[2-[acetyl(1-methylethyl) amino]ethyl]-α-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-piperidinebutanamidewhich is represented by the following structural formula(+)and[-]-α-[2-[ cetyl(1-methylethyl) aminoethyl]-α-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-piperidinebutanamidewhich is represented by the following structural formula 
( - )Both enantiomers show electrophysiologic effects in both the upper and lower parts of the heart. This electrophysiological activity would indicate that the enantiomers would be useful as antiarrhythmic agents.The convenience of the process is demonstrated by the synthetic route comprising only two steps. The cost effectiveness of the process is demonstrated by the final product being produced in high yield and high quality.The process of this invention is illustrated by the following Scheme I. 
Scheme I
 Scheme I (cont.)
 In the practice of this invention which is illustrated in Scheme I, [±]-α-[2-[acetyl(1- methylethyl)amino]ethyl]-α-(2-chlorophenyl)-1- piperidinebutanamide is mixed in an organic solvent and (1R)-(-)-10 camphorsulfonic acid is added to the solution. The solid [+]-α-[2-[acetyl(1- methylethyl)amino]ethyl]-α-(2-chlorophenyl)-1- piperidinebutanamide(-)camphorsulfonic salt is obtained by
