<DESCRIPTION>
 VARIABLE AREA TURBINEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention is directed to an exhaust gas turbine with movable vanes wherein pressure is sensed at the inlet and outlet of the vanes to control the vanes for adjusting their angle and nozzle openings to maximize efficiency.Modern internal combustion engines can supply greater output power when their cylinders are charged with more air through the use of a charging compressor, along with a corresponding increased supply of fuel. A centrifugal compressor is often used for this purpose and an exhaust gas turbine, drives the charging compressor current. Commercially available turbocharges are of a type where the housing directing the exhaust gas to the turbine is of the open volute type which has a fixed entrance area. Such fixed area housings do not provide optimum efficiency over the turbine operating range. This is because the operating conditions diverge from the optimum conditions for which that turbine was designed. At low engine speed, the turbine requires smaller inlet area, while the large exhaust gas flow at high engine rpm requires a large inlet area. Hence, the fixed housing inlet ,area designs of current commercial turbocharges have design compromises causing poor transient response time (turbo-lag), poor fuel economy, high exhaust manifold pressures at high and low engine rpm, and severe detonation in gasoline fueled engines under some operating conditions.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn order to aid in the understanding of this 

invention, it can be stated in essentially summary form that it is directed to a variable area hot gas turbine and system wherein the nozzle openings are formed between movable vanes. The hot gas pressure into and out of the vanes is measured and is used to control the vane angle and nozzle opening between the vanes to provide more optimum turbine operating conditions for increased turbine efficiency.It is, thus, an object and advantage of this invention to provide a variable nozzle area in a hot gas turbine by moving vanes which define the nozzle area to change both the nozzle angle and nozzle opening area in accordance with sensed system pressures.It is a further object and advantage of this invention to provide a hot gas turbine which has a plurality of vanes which define nozzle openings, with the vanes mounted to move together to control the nozzle area to increase operating efficiency.It is another object and advantage of this invention to provide a hot gas turbine operating system wherein the inlet and outlet
