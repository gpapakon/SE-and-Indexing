<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing wire or needles having a 
taper point. Needle or wire blanks are cut from a roll of 

wire and mounted to a carrier strip. The carrier strip 
and needles are moved through a succession of forming and 

trimming and grinding stations. The blanks are 
preferably rotated in the strip while being ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field to which this invention pertains is wire members, such
as surgical needles, more specifically, a method of
manufacturing taper point wire nenbersm e.g. surgical needles.Surgical needles and methods of manufacturing
surgical needles are well known in the art. Surgical
needles typically consist of a shaft-like member, which
may be curved or straight. The member has a distal
piercing point and a proximal end for mounting or
receiving a suture. Surgical needles are typically
classified as either taper-point needles, wherein the
diameter of the shaft tapers to a piercing point, or
cutting edge needles wherein the needles have various
cutting edges along with piercing points to assist in
penetrating various types of tissue.Surgical sutures may be attached or mounted to the
proximal ends of surgical needles in various ways. One
common way is to have a channel formed into the proximal
end of the needle. The channel end typically is die-formed
into a needle during the manufacturing process and
consists of a cavity. When a surgical suture end or tip
is placed into the cavity, the channel end is hit with a
die one or more times under pressure forcing the sidewalls
closed tightly about the suture tip to prevent the suture
from separating from the needle. The process of mounting
a suture tip to the proximal end of a needle is known in
the art as swaging. Another manner in which a suture may 
be mounted to a surgical needle is by drilling a hole,
commonly referred to in the art as blind hole, into the
proximal end of the needle. This can be done using
conventional mechanical drilling apparatuses or
conventional laser drilling apparatuses. The end or tip
of a suture is then inserted into the drilled hole and the
section of the proximal end of the needle surrounding the
blind hole is swaged in a conventional manner by
compressing with various conventional dies. It is also
known to mount sutures to surgical needles using
conventional adhesives.Surgical needles are conventionally manufactured from
surgical grade alloys, such as surgical grade stainless
steel, which are purchased from manufacturers in the form
of rod or wire. The rod is drawn into wire and rolled
onto a spool. The initial step in the manufacture of
surgical needles is to remove the wire from the spool,
degrease or clean if required, and then cut the wire into
sections known as needle blanks. Each blank will have a
length greater than the length of the finished needle,
since material will necessarily be removed from the blank
during the needle
