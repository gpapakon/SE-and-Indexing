<ABSTRACT>
The lock cylinder has a housing (1) with a reception bore (7) for the lock cylinder core (11) which is rotated about its cylinder axis (9), with a key slot extending along the latter. The key slot has a series of retaining elements (21) preventing the rotation of the cylinder core relative to the housing, released by the inserted key. The outer mantle of the cylinder core has reception pockets (29) containing armouring plates (33), lying on either side of the key slot. Pref. the pockets are provided by slots normal to the cylinder axis, each armouring plate having a contour which is a circular section and retained by a hook (39) and a cooperating stop shoulder (47).

A cylinder lock, comprising 

a housing (1), 
a cylinder plug (11) accommodated in a plug receiving 
bore (7) in the housing (1) so as to be rotatable about 

its cylinder axis (9), said cylinder plug (11) having a 
key channel (13) extending from an insertion end (27) of 

the cylinder plug (11) in the direction of the cylinder 
axis (9), 
a plurality of tumblers (19, 21) arranged one behind the 
other in at least one row along the key channel (13) and 

locking the cylinder plug (11) with respect to the 
housing (1) and being unlockable by means of a key 

insertable into the key channel (13), and 
at least one reinforcing element (33, 39) to the side of 
the key channel (13) and inserted into a pocket (29) in 

the cylinder plug (11) open towards the circumference of 
the cylinder plug (11), 
 
characterised in that the cylinder plug (11) and at least one 

of the reinforcing elements (33, 39) comprise interlocking 
means (39, 41) engaging with each other perpendicularly to 

the cylinder axis (9) and overlapping, in axial projection, 
at least partially with the contour of the reinforcing 

elements (33, 39) on the side remote from the insertion end 
(27). 
A cylinder lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the pocket is a slit (29) extending normally to the axis 

and the reinforcing element (33, 39) comprises a reinforcing 
plate (33), especially with a contour in the form of a 

segment of a circle.  
 
A cylinder lock according to claim 2, characterised in 

that the reinforcing plate (33) comprises an edge portion 
(35) in the form of a segment of a circle and at least 

approximately congruent with the circumference of the 
cylinder plug (14) and an especially straight edge portion 

(37) extending substantially parallel to the direction of the 
broad face of the key channel (13). 
A cylinder lock according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that reinforcing elements (33, 39) are 

arranged on each side of the key channel (13) especially in 
pairs in a common plane normal to the axis. 
A cylinder lock according to claim 4, characterised in 
that at least one pair of the reinforcing elements (33, 39) 

is arranged, towards the insertion end (27), in front of the 
tumbler (19, 21) at the front in the insertion direction. 
A cylinder lock according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterised in that the reinforcing elements (33, 39) of 

the pair extend to near the broad face of the key channel 
(13). 
A cylinder lock according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that, on the side remote from the insertion 

end (27) of the cylinder plug (11) at a distance from the 
pocket (29) accommodating the reinforcing element (33, 39), 

the interlocking means of the cylinder plug (11) comprise a 
shoulder (47) overlapping the pocket (29) at least partially 

and directed away from the insertion end (27) and the 
interlocking means (39) of the reinforcing element (33, 39) 

comprise a hook member (39) engaging behind the shoulder 
(47). 
A cylinder lock according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the hook member (39) comprises a web portion (43) 

extending in the direction of the cylinder axis (9) and an  
 

engagement portion (45) extending from the web portion (43) 
substantially along a plane normal to the axis. 
A cylinder lock according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the key channel (13) is staggered along its broad face 

eccentrically towards the circumference of the cylinder plug 
(11) and has a narrow face (49) open towards the 

circumference of the cylinder plug (11) and in that the web 
portion (43) is arranged at least partially in an area of the 

cylinder plug (11) lying approximately opposite the open 
narrow face (49) of the key channel (13) in the direction of 

the broad face thereof. 
A cylinder lock according to claim 8 or claim 9, 
characterised in that the web portion (43) ends flush with 

the circumference of the cylinder plug (11). 
A cylinder lock according to any one of claims 8 to 10, 
characterised in that both the reinforcing element and the 

engagement portion of its hook member (39) are constructed as 
approximately mutually parallel plates (33, 45) which engage 

in slits (29, 41) in the cylinder plug (11) extending 
normally to the axis and at a distance from each other. 
A cylinder lock according to claim 11, characterised in 
that the two plates (33, 45) have contours substantially 

congruent with each other and with the cylinder plug (11) at 
least on the side remote from the key channel (13). 
A cylinder lock according to claim 12, characterised in 
that the two plates (33, 45) are completely congruent. 
A cylinder lock according to any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the reinforcing element (33, 39) and/or 

its interlocking means (39) extend(s) as far as the 
circumference of the cylinder plug (11) and is/are provided 

in the area of the circumference of the cylinder plug (11)  
 

with at least one cutting edge (51) directed towards the plug 
receiving bore of the housing. 
A cylinder lock according to any one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the reinforcing element (33, 39) and 

its interlocking means (39) are connected integrally 
together.
