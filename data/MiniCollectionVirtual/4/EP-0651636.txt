<ABSTRACT>
Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is overexpressed in carcinomas with poor prognosis, but little FAS expression is identified in normal tissues. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis is selectively toxic to carcinoma cells, while normal cells with low FAS activity are resistant. This invention provides a method of treating cancer patients where fatty acid synthesis by cells of the patient's tumor is inhibited with resultant interruption of the disease process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. Serial No. 07/917,716, filed July
24, 1992, which is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. Serial No. 07/735,522, filed July 26,
1991, which is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. Serial No. 07/622,407, filed December 4,
1990, now abandoned, which is in turn a Continuation of U.S. Serial No. 07/297,722, filed
January 17, 1989, now abandoned, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by
reference.The work leading to this invention was supported in part by Grant No. RO1 CA
54404 from the National Institutes of Health. The U.S. Government retains certain rights
in this invention.This invention relates to the field of cancer chemotherapy. In particular, this
invention contemplates therapeutic agents which are
cytotoxic or cytostatic to tumor cells.Some carcinoma cells are slow to grow, resulting in tumors that do not pose severe
short term risk to a patient having such cells. For instance, many prostate cancers progress
so slowly that they are only detected after the patient dies from another cause. Such
carcinomas are safely left untreated. Other carcinomas metastasize and grow rapidly,
resulting in death of the patient. Any treatment that can slow down the growth of these
latter, more virulent carcinomas is desired. Most current methods of cancer therapy include treatment with chemotherapeutic
agents that inhibit cell division or radiation therapy that disrupts DNA in dividing cells.
However, these treatments also affect normal cells that happen to be dividing or synthesizing
DNA at the time of treatment. Therefore, there is a need for alternative treatments which
are more specifically targeted to affect the cells of virulent tumors.The fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in man is comprised of four major enzymes:
acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate limiting enzyme which synthesizes malonyl-CoA; malic
enzyme, which produces NADPH; citrate lyase, which synthesizes acetyl-CoA; and fatty acid
synthase, which catalyzes NADPH-dependent synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and
malonyl-CoA. The final products of fatty acid synthase are free fatty acids which require
separate enzymatic derivatization with coenzyme-A for incorporation into other products.
In man, significant fatty acid synthesis may occur in two sites: the liver, where palmitic acid
is the predominant product (Roncari, Can. J. Biochem., 52:221-230, 1974); and lactating
mammary gland where C10-C14 fatty acids predominate (Thompson, et al., Pediatr. Res.,19:139-143, 1985). Except for lactation, and cycling
