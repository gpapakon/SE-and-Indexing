<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for dry fractionating oils and 
fats comprising a nucleation stage, a crystal growth stage and a solids 

separation stage, wherein at least during the crystal growth stage a 
triglyceride oil or fat of a composition other than the composition of the 

oil or fat being dry fractionated is added to the oil or fat being dry 
fractionated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for dry fractionating oils and 
fats comprising a nucleation stage, a crystal growth stage and a solids 
separation stage, wherein at least during the crystal growth stage a 
triglyceride oil or fat of a composition other than the composition of the 
oil or fat being dry fractionated is added to the oil or fat being dry 
fractionated. Natural glyceride oils and fats comprise many different triglycerides, the 
physical properties of which to a large extent are determined by chain 
lengths and degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid moieties. To make 
natural glyceride oils and fats more suitable for particular applications it 
is often required to separate them into fractions which are more 
homogenous with respect to melting behaviour. It is known to fractionate oils and fats in the presence of an organic 
solvent such as acetone or hexane. Although this method of 
fractionation is highly efficient, it is not preferred because flammable 
solvents are used and because it is expensive. It is also known to fractionate oils and fats by using an aqueous 
solution of a surface active agent. However, this method has the 
disadvantage of low fractionation efficiency in view of yield and quality. 
Besides, post-treatment for separating the aqueous solution from the oil 
or fat is complicated and high costs are involved for treating surfactant 
containing waste water. Another method is the dry fractionation process which is carried out in 
the absence of classical organic solvents. This method comprises 
forming crystal nuclei (nucleation stage) by cooling the molten oil or fat 
to below its melting point, ageing them at a low temperature to allow 
the crystals to grow (crystal growth stage) and finaly subjecting the 
suspension to solid-liquid separation (solids separation stage). This latter 
fractionation method is the cheapest and simpliest method known in the 
art, but it has certain inherent disadvantages. The first disadvantage is 
that during the separation stage, when the partially crystallized melt is 
separated into a stearin fraction and an olein fraction, the crystals in the 
stearin fraction entrain an amount of liquid. Since this liquid is undiluted 
olein as opposed to an olein solution as is the case in solvent 
fractionation, its relative amount is rather high leading to a less selective 
fractionation with respect to the stearin fraction and a lower olein yield 
in comparison with solvent fractionation.  A second disadvantage is that the solids content
