<ABSTRACT>
A thermal dot printer controls energy applied to 
individual heat generating members (101) to control the 

amount of heat generated by the heat generating members 
(101), thereby controlling the ink melting area on an ink 

ribbon, and transfers the melted ink on a paper to print a 
gradation image on the paper. The size Lm of each heat 

generating element (101) in the main scanning direction and 
the arranging pitch DOPm of the heat generating elements 

(101) in the main scanning direction have a relationship of 

Lm ≦ DOPm × (2/3) 
 
, while the size Ls of each heat generating 

element (101) in the sub scanning direction has a 
relationship of 


Lm 
<
 Ls ≦ DOPs 
 
 with respect to 
the pitch DOPs 
in the sub scanning direction and the size Lm of the heat 

generating elements (101) in the main scanning direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal dot printer, 
and, more particularly, to a thermal dot printer which is 
capable of changing the sizes or areas of print dots to 
thereby control the gradation of a printed image. A thermal dot printer selectively energizes numerous 
heat generating members, arranged on its head, in accordance 
with print data to color a thermosensible paper (sheet) or 
transfer ink on an ink ribbon on a sheet, thereby printing an 
image on the sheet. Fig. 1 is an exemplary diagram for explaining a scheme 
of controlling the gradation (density) of an image that is to 
be printed by a thermal dot printer. In Fig. 1, a circle D represent each pixel (the maximum 
inkable range) and a circle d indicates a dot that is 
actually printed (printed dot: portion that is inked). The 
size (or area) of the printed dot d increases as the 
gradation of a pixel becomes higher. This scheme of 
adjusting the size of printed dot d to change the gradation 
(density) of the pixel is called "area gradation method" The size, Sm, of each pixel D in the main scanning 
direction (the lateral direction of the heat generating 
member) is approximately equal to the dot pitch, DOPm, in the 
main scanning direction, and the size, Ss, of the pixel D in 
the sub scanning direction (the feeding direction of paper) 
is equal to the dot pitch, DOPs, in the sub scanning 
direction. The structure of a conventional thermal print head will 
now be explained with reference to Fig. 2A in which hatching 
is done to discriminate members, not to indicate the material 
of each member in cross section. The thermal print head in Fig. 2 comprises a plurality 
of heat generating members 11 aligned in the main scanning 
direction, a common electrode 12 commonly connected to one 
ends of the heat generating members 11, and a plurality of 
segment electrodes 13 respectively connected to the other  
 
ends of the heat generating members 11. The size of the 
portion at which each heat generating member 11 is connected 
to the common electrode 12 and the size of the portion at 
which each heat generating member 11 is connected to the 
associated segment electrode 13 are equal to the size, Lm, of 
the heat generating member 11 in the main scanning direction. 
With the illustrated structure, when a voltage is applied to 
the segment electrodes 13 in accordance with print data, a 
current flows between the segment electrodes 13 and the 
common electrode 12 via the heat generating members 11, 
causing the heat generating members 11 to
