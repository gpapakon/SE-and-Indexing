<ABSTRACT>
An image processing system for processing variable resolution data. The image data 
system includes a data source (51) for supplying image data and associated mode information 

wherein the mode information controls variable resolutions of the image data when 
processed. The system further includes a memory device (58) for receiving and storing the 

image data and the associated mode information in a packed format according to the 
associated mode information; and a mode selection device (200) for receiving the image data 

and the associated mode information from the memory device (58) and for unpacking the 
image data in response to the mode information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to variable resolution image processing, and more particularly, 
to variable resolution image processing in a hyperacuity printer. Gray or multi-bit per pixel image data to be printed can be sent to image rendering 
hardware like that of a raster output scanner (ROS) for printing latent electrostatic images on 
xerographic photoreceptors. Such a system is shown US-A 5,138,339, which is hereby 
incorporated by reference The image data may be viewed as three dimensional data in that it 
has two dimensions of resolution, such as fastscan and slowscan pixel per inch resolution, and 
one dimension of gray, such as provided by the multi-bit per pixel gray value (bits per pixel). As 
such, this may be viewed as a particular aspect ratio, such as 300 by 300 (resolution) by 8 (eight 
bits per pixel), or 600 by 600 by 2, for instance. Each aspect ratio of data has advantages and disadvantages in terms of its ability to 
deliver fidelity. For instance, the 300 by 300 by 8 aspect ratio data may be desired for pictorials, 
because of its 256 values of gray which are defined by the eight bits per pixel, but has a 
disadvantage of low resolution in that it can only define 300 lines per inch. However, a higher 
resolution often is not required for printing pictorials. On the other hand, the 600 by 600 by 2 
aspect ratio data might be good for rendering small text, because higher resolution is 
desirable. The ability to define the edges of this small text is not as important since the text is 
very tiny and edge mistakes may be more difficult to see in relationship to the inherent noise. 
Therefore, using only 2 bits of gray depth, which will be later used to render the edge of the 
text, could be sufficient at the higher resolution. Another example of better transfer of fidelity can depend on orientation, such as 
when more or less vertical (perpendicular to fast scan direction) or more or less horizontal 
(parallel to fast scan direction) lines are being transferred. Using an aspect ratio which is tuned 
to the fast scan orientation (such as 240 pixels per inch (ppi) (slowscan) by 480 ppi (fastscan) by 
2 bits per pixel of gray) or slow scan orientation (such as 480 ppi (slowscan) by 240 ppi (fastscan) 
by 2 bits per pixel of gray), or , could efficiently deliver enhanced fidelity for vertical or 
horizontal edges respectively without sacrificing the use of a larger memory. It can be appreciated that fidelity can be transferred to a printer with many different 
aspect ratios. However, there are
