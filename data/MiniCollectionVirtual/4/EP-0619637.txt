<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a component for protecting a three-phase alternator associated with a rectifier bridge. Three Shockley diodes (11,12,13) and an avalanche diode (15) are interconnected by three electrodes of the first polarity of the Shockley diodes and the electrode of opposite polarity of the avalanche diode to a common terminal linked to the output (S
<
+
>
) of first polarity of the rectifier. Each of the second electrodes of the Shockley diodes is connected to each of the outputs (S1,S2,S3) of the alternator, and the second terminal of the avalanche diode is linked to the second output (S
<
-
>
) of the bridge.

<CLAIMS>
A protection component for a three-phase alternator 
associated with a rectifying bridge, characterized 

in that it includes three Shockley diodes (11, 12, 
13) and an avalanche diode (15), three electrodes, of a 

first polarity, of the Shockley diodes being 
interconnected with an electrode, of the opposite 

polarity, of the avalanche diode to a common terminal 
that is connected to the output terminal (S
+
), having a 
first polarity, of the rectifier, each second electrode 

of the Shockley diodes being connected to each output 
(S1, S2, S3) of the alternator, and the second terminal 

of the avalanche diode being connected to the second 
output terminal (S
-
) of the rectifier. 
The protection component of claim 1, characterized 
in that the first terminal of the avalanche diode 

is connected to the common terminal through a diode 
(P1-N1), forward-conducting when the avalanche diode is 

in avalanche mode. 
The protection component of claim 2, formed in a 
substrate constituted by a layer (P1) of a first 

conductivity type coated with a layer (N1) of the second 
conductivity type, characterized in that it 

comprises: 

four wells (P11, P12, P13, P15) of the first conductivity 
type formed in said layer (N1) of the second 

conductivity type, 
regions (N11, N12, N13) of the second conductivity 
type formed in three of said wells, 
front surface metallizations (M1-M4) coating the 
apparent surfaces of the four wells, and  

 
a rear surface metallization (M5) coating said 
layer (P1) of the first conductivity type, 
 
whereby the rear surface metallization corresponds to 

said common terminal and the front surface metallizations 
correspond to the other electrodes of the Shockley 

diodes and of the avalanche diode, respectively. 
The protection component of claim 3, characterized 
in that said regions (N11, N12, N13) of the second 

conductivity type are provided with shorting holes. 
The protection component of claim 3, 
characterized in that the four wells have the same doping 

level. 
The protection component of claim 5, characterized 
in that the well corresponding to the avalanche 

diode is smaller than the other wells.
