<ABSTRACT>
A portable interface unit incorporates a modem for connecting a personal computer through a bidirectional communication link to enclosed process control equipment by passing radiation, preferably infra-red radiation, through a casing enclosing the unit. The computer has a bidirectional digital serial interface specified in accordance with an industry standard, and the modem has a complementary bidirectional digital serial interface, an optical modulator and an optical demodulator, and a power supply. The power supply can be a circuit to derive power from the serial interface of the personal computer, or from a battery. The portable interface unit provides a versatile bidirectional communications link which is particularly suitable for use in hazardous environments and with electronic equipment designed to be environmentally sealed or tamperproof, and permits general purpose computers to be used to program, diagnose, configure or interrogate such equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a portable interface 
unit or modem which permits temporary bidirectional 
communication between enclosed electronic process control 
equipment and a general purpose personal computer, without 
electrical connection between the two. Radiation transducers are frequently used to 
provide a communications link between two or more devices 
in conditions where the devices are required to be 
electrically isolated or where a standard electrical 
connection would be unsuitable. Radiation transducers can function as a 
communications link between two devices in the following 
ways: unidirectionally, also known as simplex 
communication; and bidirectionally in both directions, 
known as duplex communication. An example of an application of radiation 
transducers in a simplex communication system for 
providing temporary communication between enclosed 
electronic equipment and a separable control unit is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,821,215, S.J. Woodward, 
issued on April 11, 1989 and assigned to the assignee of 
the present application. The specification of the 
Woodward patent is incorporated herein by reference. The 
Woodward patent relates to monitoring equipment for use in 
adverse or hazardous environments. The Woodward patent 
discloses a portable dumb keypad equipped with an infrared  
 
transmitter for use in communicating with monitoring 
equipment equipped with an infrared receiver and a 
display. In the Woodward patent, simplex communication 
takes place between the dumb keypad and the process 
control equipment when the keypad is docked in a recess in 
the case of the process control equipment. The dumb 
keypad allows the operator to control and change various 
parameters of the monitoring device. The monitoring 
device, on the other hand, is incapable of communicating 
with the keypad. The keypad is used to retrieve data from 
the memory of the monitoring unit by means of the display. 
This technique of retrieving data may be impractical in 
certain circumstances, particularly when a significant 
amount of data has been stored by the unit over an 
extended period of time. Furthermore, it may be 
impractical, except in the simplest of cases, to use the 
dumb keypad to program or reprogram the monitoring unit, 
especially when a plurality of monitoring units must be 
identically programmed or reprogrammed. Systems in which bidirectional communication is 
used between two electrooptically linked devices, each 
equipped with a transceiver, are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No.
