<ABSTRACT>
A tennis racket is made lighter than conventional 
tennis rackets yet has a higher center of percussion and a 

higher frequency of vibration. The head of the racket is ovoid, 
and the widest part of the head is above the longitudinal 

midpoint of the head. The longitudinal strings are fan-shaped 
and diverge outwardly and upwardly from the bottom of the head.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tennis racket
according to the preamble of claim 1, and, more
particularly, to a tennis racket which is lighter than
conventional rackets yet which is stiffer and has a higher
center of percussion than conventional rackets.Frolow U.S. Patent Re. 31,419 describes a racket which
is lighter than the standard weight of about 340 to 397 g (12 to 14 ounces)
(including the weight of the strings), has a higher center of
percussion, a higher center of gravity, a higher frequency of
vibration, and a higher ratio of Ia/Is than conventional
rackets. Specific values for the foregoing physical properties
are set forth in Figure 40. Figure 22 illustrates a racket made
from graphite fibers and epoxy which has a non-oval head shape.
The upper end of the head is relatively flat and extends
somewhat perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the racket.Frolow U.S. Patent Re. 33,372 describes additional
features, including a large head racket and a weight in the
handle. Specific values for certain physical properties are set
forth in Figure 15.Kuebler Patent US-A-4,664,380 describes a racket which
has the shape of a dual tapered beam in side elevation (Fig.
7). The widest or thickest part of the racket in side elevation
is in the general area of the throat of the racket.Wilson EPO Patent No. 317,711
which discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1
describes a racket having
a frequency of the first mode of bending under free-free
constraint between 170 Hz and 250 Hz.Wilson Sporting Goods Co. has sold tennis rackets under
the name Hammer which have some of the foregoing properties as
shown in Table 1. The Hammer rackets are made from graphite
fibers and resin. 
The numbers 95 and 110 refer to the area of the string
surface -- 613 cm2 (95 square inches) and 710 cm2 (110 square inches),
respectively. The letters si mean stiffness index and refer to
the deflection of the racket when the racket extends
horizontally and the grip is clamped and a weight of 2.8 kg is
suspended from the tip of the racket. A stiffness index of 2.7
means that the tip of the racket deflects 2.7 mm. A stiffness
index of 4.0 means that the tip of the racket deflects 4.0 mm.
The 2.7si racket deflects less and is stiffer than rackets with
higher si numbers.Balance refers to the balance point or center of
gravity of the racket and is measured from the butt end of the
racket.Frequency refers to the frequency vibration of the
first mode of bending under free-free constraint. That
frequency is described in Wilson EPO Patent

<CLAIMS>
A tennis racket comprising a frame (12) having an
elongated shaft portion (15) and a head portion (17) and strings (13, 14) supported

by the head portion (17), the frame (12) being formed from composite
material comprising fibers and resin, the shaft terminating in a

butt end (20) and the head having top and bottom portions, the racket
having a length of at least 67,31 cm (26.5 inches), characterized by a strung weight of less

than 269,3 g (9.5 ounces), a balance point of greater than 39,37 cm (15.5 inches)
from the butt end, a center of percussion of greater than 49,53 cm (19.5

inches) from the butt end, and a frequency of vibration of the
first mode of bending under free-free constraint of at least

190 Hz.
The tennis racket of claim 1 in which the frame (12) has
the shape of a dual tapered beam in side elevation, the widest

part of the frame (12) in side elevation being adjacent the bottom
portion of the head, the frame tapering downwardly from said

widest part toward the top of the head and tapering downwardly
from said widest part toward the butt end (20) of the shaft.
The tennis racket of claim 2 in which the width (w) of
the frame at said widest part is at least about 3 cm (1.181 inches).
The tennis racket of claim 1 in which the weight of
the racket is about 267,9 g (9.45 ounces) or less.
The tennis racket of claim 4 in which the center of
percussion is about 50,8 cm (20.0 inches) or more from the butt end (20).
The tennis racket of claim 4 in which the balance
is about 39,5 cm (15.55 inches) or more from the butt end (20). 
The tennis racket of claim 1 in which the head is
generally ovoid shaped, the top of the head having a radius of

curvature (R
1
) at least twice the radius of cuvature (R
5
) of the bottom of
the frame, the widest part of the head being above the

longitudinal midpoint of the head.
The tennis racket of claim 7 in which the widest
part of the head is at least about 0.60 of the distance (l) from the

bottom of the head to the top of the head.
The tennis racket of claim 7 in which the head has
a string area of about 621,5 cm
2
 (95 square inches) and the radius of
curvature (R
1
) of the top of the head is at least about 15,24 cm to 16,51 cm (6 to 6.5
inches).
The tennis racket of claim 9 in which the maximum
longitudinal dimension (l) of the string area is about 32,56 ± 1,27 cm (12.7 ± 1/2

inch), the maximum width (w) of the string area is about 24,13 ± 1,27 cm (9.5 ± 1/2
inch), and the widest part of the string area is above the

longitudinal midpoint of the string area.
The tennis racket of claim 7 in which the head has
a string area of about 621,5 cm
2
 (95 square inches) and the radius of
cuvature (R
1
) of the top of the head is at least about 15,75 to 18,29 cm (6.2 to 7.2
inches).
The tennis racket of claim 11 in which the maximum
longitudinal dimension (l) of the string area is about 34,8 ± 1,27 cm (13.7 ± 1/2

inch), the maximum width (w) of the string area is about 25,91 ± 1,27 cm (10.2 ± 1/2
inch), and the widest part of the string area is above the

longitudinal midpoint of the string area. 
The tennis racket of claim 7 in which the strings
which are spaced laterally from the longitudinal centerline (CL) of

the frame (12) diverge outwardly with respect to the longitudinal
centerline from the bottom of the head to the top of the head.
