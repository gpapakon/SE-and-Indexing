<ABSTRACT>
An induction furnace comprises a crucible (30) for 
holding a material to be heated by the furnace, an 

induction coil assembly (12) and a module-support 
assembly (60) surrounding and radially supporting the 

induction coil assembly so as to facilitate the 
replacement and reconnection of the induction coil 

assembly. The induction coil assembly comprises an 
induction coil (34), an upper yoke (36), a lower yoke 

(38) and a plurality of intermediate yokes (40) that 
are spaced apart from each other. The induction coil 

(34) is wound around the crucible and defines the 
periphery of the induction furnace. The intermediate 

yokes (40) are arranged to extend around substantially 
all of the periphery defined by the wound induction 

coil. The upper and lower yokes are 
electromagnetically coupled together by the plurality 

of intermediate yokes. The module-support assembly 
(60) has upright members (62) and shaft members (66) 

that allow each of the plurality of intermediate yokes 

to be separately removed from the furnace while the 
other intermediate yokes remain in place and to allow 

for the induction coil assembly to be removed from the 
furnace in its entirety.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to induction furnaces and, more particularly,
to induction furnaces having an induction coil assembly that is structurally
interconnected with the furnace in a modular manner. The modular
induction coil assembly comprises a helical induction coil and segmented
intermediate yokes that share the majority of the circumferential region
covered by the helical induction coil. The modular structure facilitates fault
isolation by allowing for the easy and convenient removal of either the
segmented yokes or the assembly itself.Induction furnaces for melting metal by generating magnetic
fields which induce eddy currents to flow within and heat the metal are well-known.
In such furnaces, an induction coil assembly creates the magnetic
fields. Induction coil assemblies are commonly considered to include an
induction coil, and upper, lower and intermediate yokes.Because of the high power typically required to accomplish
industrial-scale heating of the metal within the crucible, the induction coil
assembly and its components are relatively large. A relatively large induction
coil assembly is well-suited to its desired purpose, but its size becomes a
disadvantage in the event of a fault condition. More particularly, if the 
induction coil assembly experiences a fault, an inordinate
amount of time is typically required to disconnect and then
reconnect the faulty component of the assembly, as well as the
relatively large cables associated with delivering the high
power to these components. The excessive disconnect and
reconnect times directly contribute to excessive down time in
which the associated induction furnace is removed from
production.In ASEA JOURNAL, Vol. 41, Number 2-3, 1968, VÃ„STERAS,
SCHWEDEN, pages 32-35: B. HANAS et al - "Recent developments
and future trends in coreless induction furnaces" there is
described a furnace having steel yokes evenly distributed
around the outside of the coil, giving radial,support to the
coil and thus to the crucible. The whole body is intended to
form a compact unit to assist in damping vibrations.In EP-A-0232846 there is described an induction furnace
having a coil and a lining, where the coil is not in direct
contact with the ladle. Also, the coil is formed with
transposed or sheet-wound conductors.An induction furnace having a replaceable coil assembly
which facilitates its removal and replacement is known and is
made available from Pillar Industries Limited Partnership of
Menomonee Falls, WI as their "shunt pac design." The
replaceable coil assembly

An induction furnace (10) comprising a crucible (30)
having a predetermined shape for holding a material to be

heated by said furnace; and an induction coil assembly (12)
surrounding said crucible (30) and having a central axis

(34'), a preselected axial length and a predetermined inner
diameter, said induction coil assembly comprising an induction

coil (34) wound around the crucible and defining a periphery
of said induction furnace, and yokes around the outside of the

coil (34), characterised in that the yokes comprise an upper
yoke (36), a lower yoke (38) and a plurality of intermediate

yokes (40) spaced apart from each other, said intermediate
yokes (40) being arranged to extend around substantially all

of the periphery defined by said induction coil (34), said
upper and lower yokes being axially separated from each other

and electro-magnetically coupled together by said plurality
of intermediate yokes (40); and in that a module-support

assembly (60) is provided surrounding and radially supporting
said induction coil assembly (12), said module-support

assembly having upright members (62) and shaft members (66)
to allow each of said plurality of intermediate yokes (40) to

be separately removed from said induction coil assembly (12)
while the others remain in place and to allow the induction

coil assembly (12) to be removed in its entirety from said
furnace.
An induction furnace according to claim 1,
characterised in that said intermediate yokes (40) extend

around about 80% of the periphery defined by said induction
coil (34) so that the amount of stray magnetic flux that finds

its way out of the confines of said furnace is reduced. 
An induction furnace according to claim 1 or 2,
