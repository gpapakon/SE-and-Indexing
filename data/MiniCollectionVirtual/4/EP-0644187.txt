<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally pertains to heterocyclic
carbon compounds having drug and bio-affecting
properties and to their preparation and use. In
particular the invention is concerned with
cyclobutenedione-substituted tryptamine derivatives.
These compounds possess a unique serotonergic profile
that renders them useful in treatment of vascular
headaches such as migraine or cluster type.Dowie, etal. disclosed a series of 3-alkylaminoindole
derivatives as being potentially useful for the
treatment of migraine in a published patent
application, GB 2,124,210. One member of this series
of compounds was specifically claimed in a later
patent application of Oxford, GB 2,162,522, published
February 5, 1986. This particular compound is known
in the literature as sumatriptan(i).
A series of substituted cyclic sulfamidoindole
derivatives have been disclosed in EP 0501568A as
being potentially usefully in treating migraine and
associated conditions. One of the compounds
specifically claimed is formula (ii). 
Migraine is a member of a broader class of
headache that also comprises cluster headaches and
other headaches believed to have a vascular
implication in their etiology. These headaches are
often classified as vascular headaches. For a current
summary of headache and its treatment see: Chapter
13: "Drugs Used to Treat Migraine and Other
Headaches" in Drug Evaluations, 6th Edn., 1986, pages
239-253 American Medical Association, W.B. Saunders
Co., Philadelphia, PA.Frequent irregularly-occurring episodes of
headache afflict a large number of people but are
usually acute in nature and of short duration. Relief
of this type of headache is typically provided by mild
analgesics such as aspirin or acetaminophen. Such
headaches are quite common and, while painful and
perhaps annoying, are seldom incapacitating and
debilitating. Chronic recurrent headaches of the
vascular category, however, usually lead to patient
consultation with a physician due to pain severity
which is often incapacitating.Although there is no universally accepted
classification system for headache, vascular headache,
for the purposes of the present invention, refers
mainly to migraine and cluster headaches. Migraine
includes the common or classical type as well as
migraine variants which would be familiar to one
skilled in the art. Other subtypes such as toxic
vascular and hypertensive headaches, chronic 
paroxysmal hemicrania, as well as some muscle-contraction
and combined or mixed vascular-muscle
headaches may also fall into a vascular-related
heada
