<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 having recording means for outputting input
information such as characters or image onto the
recording medium, and an information processing system
having said recording apparatus as output means, such
as a copying machine, a facsimile, a printer, a word
processor, and a personal computer.Conventionally, recording apparatuses which
perform the recording on the recording medium
(hereinafter simply referred to as the recording
sheet) such as paper, cloth, plastic sheet, OHP sheet,
etc., have been proposed in the form capable of mounting
a recording head of various recording systems including,
for example, wire dot system, thermal system, thermal
transfer system, and ink jet system.Among those recording apparatuses, a recording
apparatus comprising a recording head of the ink jet
system in which the recording is performed on the
recording sheet by discharging the ink through discharge 
ports (nozzles) arranged on the recording elements
(hereinafter referred to as an ink jet recording
apparatus), known as the non-impact recording with low
noise, can attain high density and fast recording
operation.The ink jet recording apparatus takes the
configuration corresponding to the specific functions
or service conditions of the system to which the
apparatus is applied. Typically, the ink jet recording
apparatus comprises a carriage having a recording head
and an ink tank mounted thereon, conveying means for
conveying the recording sheet, and control means for
controlling them.And the recording head for discharging ink
droplets through a plurality of discharge ports is
scanned serially in a direction (main scan direction)
orthogonal to a conveying direction (sub-scan direction)
of the recording sheet, while the recording sheet is
conveyed intermittently (pitch feed) by an amount equal
to the recording width when not recording. By using the
recording head having a number of nozzles for discharging
the ink arranged linearly in the sub-scan direction, the
recording can be performed for a width corresponding to
the number of nozzles every time the recording head
scans once over the recording sheet.Also, the ink jet recording apparatus has the
low running cost, can be made more compact, and is easy 
to deal with the color image recording by using color
inks. In particular, a recording apparatus of the line
type using recording means of the line type having a
number of discharge ports arranged in the width
direction of the
