<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for searching for a characteristic grouping of data which is periodically inserted into a flow of successively transmitted data. Memory-storage means (7) temporarily store the received data sequence corresponding to the minimum subset necessarily including the grouping sought. Comparator means (8) search for a reference element relating to the grouping sought in a preselected area consisting of one of the modules subdividing the stored subset. The search is carried on module by module, until a group of data identical to the reference element is identified. Means (11) store the position of any group which is identical to the reference element in the module where such a group has been identified. A confirmation search makes it possible to eliminate the positions of the groups which are not subsequently found again, only the position of the last group present remaining, which is considered as the reference sought.

A method of searching for a digital data group inserted periodically into a data
stream transmitted at a given clock rate, said method being 
characterized in that

it includes the following steps:

temporary modular storage of a volume of data successively received
corresponding to the minimal subset necessarily containing at least one

characteristic part of the group looked for;
initial searching, by comparison, for a reference element corresponding at least
to said characteristic group part in one module specifically selected as a

preferred search area of the stored subset and continued searching, module by
module in the subset, until identification of at least one data group identical to

the reference element in one of the modules of said stored subset;
memorizing the position of any data group found identical to the reference
element in the first module of the stored subset in which at least one such group

has been identified;
confirmation searching, by comparison, of the persistence of a data group
identical to the reference element of a subset in the next one, for all memorized

group positions of a module in the module of the next stored subset having the
same numerical position;
maintained memorizing for all memorized group positions found identically in
the module of the next subset having the same numerical position;
choosing, as the actual reference position for the group, of the position of the
group identical to the reference element which alone remains memorized in a

module of a stored subset.
A search method according to claim 1 for a data stream comprising data
transmitted successively in subframes of period "t", by at least one transmission

channel into which the group is inserted with a period "T" which is a multiple of "t"
in a same one of the subchannels constituting a transmission channel,


characterized in that
 it includes temporary storage of a volume of data
successively received for a transmission channel during the same period of

duration "T" and search steps each applying to data received with the same
numerical position during successive subframes of period "t" during the period "T"

considered.
A search method according to at least claim 2 for a group comprising data with
the same numerical position in successive subframes of period "t" divided over at

least two periods "T" of which the first contains the data from a characteristic part
of the group, 
characterized in that
 it includes a complementary search step, after
confirmation that only one position remains memorized in a module of a subset,

to verify the presence at the expected position in the frame "T" following that in
which said single remaining position was determined of the part of the

corresponding group not so far identified, before the step of signalling the
position of the group as the actual reference position.
A search device for implementing the method according to at least claim 1
having subset memorizing means (7) for temporarily storing modules of a

volume of data successively received corresponding to the minimal volume
necessarily containing at least one reference element of a group, comparator

means (8) for detecting any data group identical to the reference element, means 
(10) for determining the position of any group found identical to the reference

element in a subset module, 
characterized in that
 it includes memorizing means
(11) for recording the position of any group found identical to the reference

element in a module, said position memorizing means cooperating with the
previously mentioned means to verify the persistent presence of a group identical

to the reference element in the same position in at least the stored subset
following a first subset temporarily stored, and for memorizing, as the actual

reference position, the position of the group identical to the reference element
which is the only one remaining in memory for a module following an initial

search of one subset and at least one confirmation search of the next subset.
