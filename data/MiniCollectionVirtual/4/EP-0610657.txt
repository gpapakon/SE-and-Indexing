<ABSTRACT>
A process for partially sawing the streets or grooves (50) on 
semiconductor wafers (48). After sawing, the streets (50) can be covered by a 

protective material (52), and then the wafer continues its processing as 
before. After the wafer (48) is broken, the protective material (52) may or 

may not be removed. Additionally, the wafer(50) may be broken into 
individual chips using a wedge piece (70) that has a number of individual 

wedges (72) on it, where the individual wedges (70) press against the 
partially sawn streets (50), causing the wafer (48) to break.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor processing, more particularly
to saw and cleaning operations.Multilayered devices, such as micromachines, that are built on
semiconductor wafers are becoming more common. Many of these require
processing of sacrificial layers or similar processes that are better done while
the individual chips are still in wafer form.However, many problems with contaminants and debris arise if the
processing is done before dicing the wafer into separate chips. For example,
if the wafer is processed to remove a sacrificial or protective layer used in the
earlier stages of the process, when the wafer is divided into chips, debris from
the division can come in contact with the surfaces previously protected or
covered by the sacrificial layer.Another option is to divide the wafer first, then finish any processes
that remove sacrificial or protective layers on the individual chips.
Depending on the process, and the carriers used for the process, this can be
prohibitively time-consuming, labor-intensive and very expensive.Patent abstracts of Japan, volume 5, no. 141 (E-073), 05.09.1981, discloses a
method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, wherein a groove is provided
on a semiconductor wafer using a dicer, a shock resistance insulating material
is filled and the pellet is cut together with the filler, thereby preventing
the chipping off of the pellet edge of the semiconductor wafer during
cutting.From DE-A-1932371 a method for manufacturing semiconductor chips is known,
wherein a wafer comprising diamond scribed streets is broken into chips by
pressing the wafer against a shape tool using a pressure foil. A protecting
foil is placed between the wafer and the pressure foil to protect the
electrodes and connections of the semiconductor elements during breaking and
the whole assembly is covered with an expandable foil, which is bounded
thereto by an adhesive. The semiconductor chips are separated from each other
after breaking by expanding the expandable foil.There still exists a need for a method or process that allows
processing to be done in wafer form in such a manner to eliminate or limit  
contact between the debris caused by dividing the wafer, while not requiring
large amounts of time.The present invention disclosed herein comprises a method of
processing semiconductor wafers that eliminates contact between
protected\covered surfaces and debris from wafer division.
In accordance with the present invention, a process for fabricating
semiconductor chips from a semiconductor

<CLAIMS>
A process for fabricating semiconductor chips from a semiconductor wafer
(48) comprising:


partially sawing grooves (50) in the wafer (48);
covering said partially sawn grooves (50) with a protective material (44; 52)
such that said partially sawn grooves (50) are completely covered, but said

protective material (44; 52) does not cover all of said wafer (48); and
separating said wafer (48) into individual chips; 
characterized in that
said wafer (48) with said partially sawn grooves (50) is further processed as
required to complete structures being fabricated thereon including removal of

any sacrificial layers and including thin-film processes; and that
separating said wafer (48) comprises
breaking said wafer (48) at said partially sawn grooves (50) into individual
chips after said processing steps.
The process of claim 1, wherein said step of covering said grooves (50)
comprises covering the grooves with a protective material tape (44).
The process of claim 1, wherein said step of covering said grooves (50)
comprises covering the grooves with caulking.
The process of any preceding claim, wherein said process also includes the
step of removing the protective material (44; 52).
The process of any preceding claim, wherein breaking said semiconductor
wafer (48) comprises:


using a wedge piece (70), wherein said wedge piece (70) comprises a plurality
of pointed wedges (72) positioned such that said wedges (72) contact the wafer 

(48) at points aligned with said grooves (50) and
forcing said wafer (48) to break at every point where said wedge contacts said
wafer (48) by applying pressure to said points.
The process of claim 5, wherein said sawing step includes mounting said
wafer (48) to a saw frame (54), and maintaining said wafer (48) on said saw

frame (54) for the entire process.
The process of claim 5, wherein said sawing step includes mounting said
wafer (48) to a saw frame (54) and then demounting said wafer (48) from said

saw frame (54) after said sawing step is completed.
The process of any of claims 5 to 7, wherein said applying pressure further
comprises applying a vacuum to force said wafer (48) against said wedge piece

(70).
The process of any of claims 5 to 7 wherein said applying pressure further

frame (54).
The process of claim 3 wherein said covering step uses a material that
does not generate particles or outgasses.

said grooves (50), said wafer (48) contains micromechanical devices including

structures supported above said wafer by a sacrificial layer; said protective

said partially sawn grooves (50), wherein said protective material (44; 52)

prevents any debris from said separation from coming into contact with any of
said surfaces of said micromechanical devices and removing said chips.
