<ABSTRACT>
The relative amplitudes of seismic reflection data 
contains very useful information about the subsurface 

earth formations. Surface and subsurface-consistent 
amplitude processing identifies and corrects for the 

variability introduced by instrumentation and surface 
distortions. Dynamic amplitude decomposition is 

disclosed which identifies and compensates for 
reflection amplitude fading due to subsurface 

transmission absorption media.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of seismic
exploration and seismic data processing and concerns
compensating the observed amplitudes of seismic events
for the effects of transmission losses due to wavefield
propagation through overburden anomalies. The purpose
is to better study seismic amplitude variations as a
function of lithologic structure.It has long been known that the amplitude of
seismic waveforms reflected from subsurface earth
layers is influenced, in part, by the lithology of
those layers. The reflection amplitude depends upon
the acoustic impedance of the lithologic interface.
The acoustic impedance is a function of the velocity
contrast between two rock layers. The velocity is a
function of the elasticity and density of the rock,
which quantities, in turn, are a function of certain
other parameters such as the composition and fluid
content of the rocks. One of the more successful
seismic amplitude studies led to the discovery of the
Bright Spot display wherein gas/liquid interfaces are
defined.There is a plethora of physical phenomena that
affect the amplitude of seismic transient waveforms,
many of which are known or can be estimated and many of
which have yet to be discovered. To name a few such
phenomena we have: Source strength and coupling,
receiver sensitivity, instrumental imbalance, receiver
coupling to the earth, array directivity, near-surface
scattering and absorption, solid friction,
reverberation, reflector rugosity, spherical spreading,
focusing effects, source-to receiver offset, random
noise and microseism. The amplitude level of deep
reflections may be 100 dB or more down with respect to 
the level of the first-arriving impulses by reason of
the cumulative transmission losses at depth.Many of the effects listed can be controlled or at
least closely estimated such as source strength and
receiver sensitivity. Amplitude as a function of
offset and the effects of spherical spreading can be
calculated. Other problems such as source or receiver
coupling, reverberation and the like, cannot always be
measured. Random noise, which always plagues us, can
sometimes be minimized by statistical methods. Many
effects that presently cannot be quantified are simply
ignored.Taner et al, in Surface consistent corrections,
Geophysics, v. 46, pp.17-22, teach a method that
decomposes seismic amplitudes into source, receiver,
geology and offset components. The components are used
to compensate for distortions associated with sources
and receivers and for amplitude distortions introduced
