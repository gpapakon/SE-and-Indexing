<ABSTRACT>
A photomask substrate plate of synthetic fused silica glass 
for use in photolithography can be imparted with remarkably improved 

stability relative to the transmissivity to ultraviolet light 
and to the dimensional changes due to so-called "radiation compaction" 

under irradiation, in particular, with ultraviolet light of 
short wavelength, such as the light emitted from an ArF excimer 

laser, when the content of molecular hydrogen in the fused silica 
glass is in the range from 1×10¹⁷ to 1×10¹⁹ molecules/cm³. The 

content of molecular hydrogen can be controlled within the specified 
range by suitably selecting the conditions used in the preparation 

of silicon dioxide by the direct flame hydrolysis method and 
the annealing treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photomask substrate plate 
of synthetic fused silica glass for photolithography used in the patterning 
work for the manufacture of various kinds of electronic devices 
or, more particularly, the invention relates to a photomask 
substrate plate of synthetic fused silica glass capable of exhibiting 
outstandingly high stability in the light transmissivity and dimensional 
stability even when the photomask is used for the patternwise 
exposure of a resist layer to ultraviolet light by using an 
excimer laser as the light source. As is well known, the recent trend in the manufacturing process 
of fine electronic devices such as semiconductor silicon-based 
ICs, LSIs and the like toward a higher and higher degree of integration 
largely depends on the progress in the photolithographic 
patterning technology for the formation of a patterned resist layer 
on the surface of a substrate such as a semiconductor silicon wafer 
so that pattern resolution in a submicron-order fineness is required 
for the photolithographic patterning. Since the photolithographic 
patterning work involves a step of patternwise exposure of 
the resist layer to light through a pattern-bearing transparency 
called a photomask, one of the limiting factors for the pattern resolution 
is the wavelength of the light for the patternwise exposure,  
 
which must be as short as possible for the finest pattern resolution. 
In this regard, there is also a trend that conventional ultraviolet 
light sources are under continuous replacement with an excimer 
laser such as KrF and ArF excimer lasers emitting ultraviolet 
light of a shorter wavelength. Needless to say, an optical system with such short-wavelength 
ultraviolet light can be constructed only by using a material 
having an extremely high transparency to the short-wavelength 
ultraviolet as the material for the lenses, prisms and the like as 
well as for the photomask substrate plate when the optical system 
is for the photolithographic patterning. In this regard, fused silica 
glass is the only material suitable for use in an optical system with 
short-wavelength ultraviolet light although fused silica glass is 
not always quite satisfactory for the purpose depending on the 
quality. For example, fused silica glass prepared by melting natural 
quartz crystals has a relatively low transmissivity to the ultraviolet 
light in a wavelength region of 250 nm or shorter along with 
a problem of instability against irradiation with ultraviolet light 
to cause
