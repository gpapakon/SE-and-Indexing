<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a glass composition having a 
neutral gray color and a luminous (visible) transmittance within a range 

that allows the glass to be used in the forward vision areas of a vehicle. 
The base glass is a soda-lime-silica composition and iron, cobalt, selenium 

and/or nickel are added as colorants. In one particular embodiment of the 
invention which is essentially nickel-free, a neutral gray colored glass with 

a luminous transmittance (C.I.E. illuminant A) of 60% and higher at a 
thickness of 3.9 millimeters may be attained by using as colorants: 0.30 

to 0.70 wt. % Fe₂O₃, no greater than 0.21 wt. % FeO, 3-50 PPM CoO 
and 1-15 PPM Se, and preferably 0.32 to 0.65 wt. % Fe₂O₃, 0.065 to 

0.20 wt. % FeO, 5 to 40 PPM CoO and 1 to 9 PPM Se. In an alternate 
embodiment of the invention which includes nickel oxide as a colorant, a 

neutral gray colored glass with a luminous transmittance of 60% and 
higher at a thickness of 3.9 millimeters may be attained by using 0.15 to 

0.65 wt. % Fe₂O₃, no greater than 0.18 wt. % FeO, 15-55 PPM CoO, 0-5 
PPM Se and 25-350 PPM NiO as colorants, and preferably 0.17 to 0.60 

wt. % Fe₂O₃, 0.04 to 0.16 wt. % FeO, 20 to 52 PPM CoO, 0 to 3 PPM 
Se and at least 50 PPM NiO.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves a neutral gray colored glass that has a
luminous transmittance that makes it highly desirable for use in forward
vision areas of a vehicle, such as a windshield and front door windows.
In particular, the glass has a luminous transmittance of
70% or greater. In addition, the glass of the present
invention generally exhibits lower infrared and total solar energy
transmittance comparable to typical green glasses used in automotive
applications to reduce heat gain in the interior of the enclosure. The glass
is also compatible with flat glass manufacturing methods.Various heat-absorbing glass substrates are known in the art.
The primary colorant in typical green tinted automotive glasses is iron,
which is usually present in both the Fe2O3 and FeO forms. As is
conventional, the total amount of iron present in a glass is expressed
herein as Fe2O3, regardless of the form actually present. Typical green
tinted automotive glass has about 0.5 percent by weight total iron, with
the ratio of FeO to total iron being about 0.25.Some glasses, e.g. U.S. Reissue Patent No. 25,312 to
Duncan et al., produce a gray color in the glass by including nickel oxide
as a colorant. However, inclusion of nickel containing materials must be
carefully controlled because the presence of nickel during the melting
process sometimes leads to the formation of nickel sulfide stones in the
glass. Additional potential problems faced when using nickel include haze
formation on the glass surface due to reduction of the nickel in the tin
bath and change in the glass color when it is heat treated. To avoid this problem, nickel-free colored glasses containing
iron oxide, cobalt oxide, and selenium were developed as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 3,296,004 to Duncan et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,723,142 to
Kato et al. and British Patent Specification 1,331,492 to Bamford. In
U.S. Patent No. 4,104,076 to Pons, instead of nickel, Cr2O3 or UO2 are
used in combination with iron oxide, cobalt oxide, and selenium to
produce gray glass. A more recent, nickel-free version of gray glass is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,023,210 to Krumwiede et al. which uses
iron oxide, cobalt oxide, selenium, and chromic oxide as colorants.Many of the commercially available gray glasses are too dark
to be used in the forward vision area of a vehicle. In addition, the lighter
gray glasses exhibit solar performance properties inferior to those of
conventional green automotive glass resulting in elevated interior vehicle
temperatures which adversely affect
