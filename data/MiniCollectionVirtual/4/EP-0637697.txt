<ABSTRACT>
A brake pad wear probe contains a plurality of 
terminals turned or bent into a U-shape with their tip 

positions offset from each other. The terminals are cut 
in stages according to the wear development degree of the 

brake pad. The terminals define energization routes to 
electro-magnetic coils at relays, and the broken line 

state of the terminal can be detected at the respective 
relay by detection of a break in its corresponding 

energization route. As a result, electro-magnetic 
switches work in response to the wear development degree, 

turning on predetermined indicator lamps of a display to 
inform a driver of the brake wear condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pad wear indicator for 
informing the user of brake pad wear and more particularly 
to a pad wear indicator for informing the user of brake 
pad wear in response to the broken line state of an 
electric wire path disposed in a pad wear indicator probe 
wearing together with a brake pad. A pad wear indicator comprises a pad wear 
indicator probe containing a U-shaped electric wire path 
that is broken when the probe wears together with its 
corresponding brake pad and includes a pad wear indicator 
display for detecting the broken line state of the 
electric wire path for displaying the wear state of the 
brake pad. Figures 10 and 11 show, respectively, a 
conventional pad wear indicator probe and a corresponding 
conventional pad wear indicator display. To form the pad wear indicator probe 1, a copper 
wire 3 having barrel parts 2 that can be crimped onto 
electric wires formed at both ends is formed into a U-like 
shape, and the barrel parts 2 are crimped onto a pair of 
electric wires 4 whose tips are coated. The entire 
assembly is molded in resin. The U-shaped turn part is 
directed toward the brake disk side for use as a brake 
pad. The pad wear indicator display 5 (Fig. 11) 
comprises a relay 7 having an electro-magnetic coil 6 in 
series with the pad wear probe 1 that is connected to a 
power line. An indicator lamp 9 in series with an 
electro-magnetic switch 8 of the relay 7 is also connected 
to the power line. The electro-magnetic switch 8 is 
turned off when the electro-magnetic coil 6 is energized. With this construction, the copper wire 3, located 
within the pad wear probe 1, initially supplies power to 
the electro-magnetic coil of the relay 7 via the electric 
wire 4 and the copper wire 3 (Figure 11). Therefore, the 
electro-magnetic switch 8 is turned off as shown with the 
broken line, and the indicator lamp 9 cannot be energized.  
 As a brake is used, the lining of its brake pad 
wears along with the pad wear probe 1. When the probe 
wears a predetermined amount from the tip, the turn part 
or bend of the copper wire 3 in the pad wear probe 1 wears 
until it is eventually cut, thus opening the circuit. 
Then, the energization path to the electro-magnetic coil 6 
is broken, and thus, the electro-magnetic coil 6 becomes 
deenergized, turning on the electro-magnetic switch 8, as 
shown with a solid line in Figure 11. Accordingly, the 
indicator lamp 9 is energized, prompting the user to 
replace the brake pad. When the conventional pad wear indicator
