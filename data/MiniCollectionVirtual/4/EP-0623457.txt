<ABSTRACT>
Magazine device for folding boxes in packaging machines, having a magazine duct (1) guiding the folding boxes stacked alongside each other on end, and a gripper (3) accepting the folding box (2) respectively nearest the front in the magazine duct (1). The gripper (3), circulating in a plane, can be adjusted in the circulation plane, for matching to the box format, in a direction (4) which includes an angle alpha with the imaginary intersecting straight line between the surface of the folding box (2) standing at the box opening (5) and the circulation plane. The magazine duct (1) can be adjusted and set parallel to itself in a direction (6) which lies perpendicular to the bisecting-line (7) of the angle alpha in the circulation plane.

<CLAIMS>
A magazine apparatus for folding boxes or the like in 
packaging machines, comprising a magazine shaft (1) for guiding the 

folding boxes which are stacked on edge in side-by-side relationship and 
a gripper (3), in particular a suction head, for taking over the folding 

box (2) which is foremost in the magazine shaft (1), wherein the gripper 
(3) which circulates in a plane is displaceable for adaptation to the 

box format in the plane of circulation in a direction (4) which includes 
an angle alpha with the notional straight intersection line between the 

plane of circulation and the surface of the folding box (2) disposed at 
the shaft mouth (5), characterised in that the magazine shaft (1) is 

displaceable and adjustable parallel to itself in a direction (6), 
wherein said one direction is perpendicular to the bisector
 (7) of the 
angle alpha in the plane of circulation and that upon displacement of 

the gripper (3) over a distance which is standardised to one the 
magazine shaft (1) is displaced by a distance corresponding to the 

quotient of the sine of the angle alpha and the cosine of half the angle 
alpha, wherein displacement of the gripper (3) and the magazine shaft 

(1) is respectively effected in a direction in which the gripper (3) and 
the magazine shaft (1) are respectively moved at the same time towards 

and away from the notional point of intersection (47) between the two 
directions (4, 6) of displacement of the gripper (3) and the magazine 

shaft (1). 
A magazine apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the magazine shaft (1) has a discharge shaft (48) and a feed device 

(49) with a substantially horizontal guide direction (12) and there is 
provided a drive held in an inclined guide (50) on a stationary main 

body (51) and between the main body (51) and the magazine shaft (1).  
 
A magazine apparatus according to claim 2 characterised in 
that the drive is formed by an axially immovably mounted screwthreaded 

spindle (52) extending on the main body (51) in the direction of 
displacement (6) of the magazine shaft (1) and a spindle nut (53) 

arranged on the magazine shaft (1). 
A magazine apparatus according to claim 3 characterised in 
that the main body (51) is arranged on one side of the magazine shaft 

(1) and further arranged at one end of the screwthreaded spindle (52) is 
a bevel transmission (5) having a shaft portion (55) which is 

perpendicular to the plane defined by the direction of displacement (6) 
of the magazine shaft (1) and the feed direction (12) of the magazine 

shaft (1) and which is mounted rotatably and axially immovable on the 
main body (51). 
A magazine apparatus according to one of claims 2 to 4 
characterised in that a second shaft portion (56) is rotatably and 

axially immovably mounted on the magazine shaft (1) at the side opposite 
to the main body (51), the second shaft portion (56) being coupled to 

the other shaft portion (55) by a connecting shaft (57) flexibly in 
respect of the connecting length and mutual displacement. 
A magazine apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in 
that the connecting shaft (57) has two universal joints (58, 59) which 

couple the two shaft portions (55, 56) of the connecting shaft (57), 
wherein the connecting shaft (57) is formed at the one universal joint 

(58) as a hollow shaft with a slot (60) extending in the longitudinal 
direction in the shaft casing (61) and at the other universal joint (59) 

as a shaft bar member with a pin (62) which is non-rotatably and axially 
slidably guided in the slot (60) in the hollow shaft. 
A magazine apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 6 
characterised in that the transmission ratio of the bevel transmission 

(54) and the pitch of the screw-threaded spindle (52) associates a  
 

distance with a full revolution of the shaft portions (55, 56) which are 
coupled by the connecting shaft (57), upon displacement of the magazine 

shaft (1), said distance corresponding to the distance covered in the 
associated direction of displacement (4) and the direction associated 

therewith, in the displacement of the gripper (3). 
A magazine apparatus according to one of claims 4 to 7 
characterised in that there are provided a measurement sensor (37) and a 

digital display (38) for monitoring the revolutions of the shaft 
portions (55, 56). 
A magazine apparatus according to one of claims 2 to 8 
characterised in that two mutually parallel inclined guides (50) are 

arranged on the main body (51) at a spacing in the guide direction (12). 
A magazine apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that the main body (51) is adjustable in respect of 

height on guide columns (64) and is displaceable in the direction of the 
longitudinal axis of the magazine shaft (1).
