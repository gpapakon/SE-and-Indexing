<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a screen for an 
aquarium tank and, more particularly, to a screen which is 
disposed in an aquarium tank for enhancing the appearance 
of the tank interior. Figure 5 shows a prior art aquarium tank as described in 
JP-A-5-82262. As shown, the tank comprises a tank body 51, over which a 
filter unit 52 is disposed. The filter unit 52 has a base 
frame 54 which is placed on an upper frame 53 of the tank 
body. A filter tank 55 and a pump mechanism 56 are 
mounted on the base frame 54. A filter chamber 57 and a 
float chamber 58 are formed in the filter tank 55. Water 
is drawn from the tank by the pump mechanism 56 and 
supplied to and filtered through a filter material 59 in 
the filter chamber 57, and the filtered water is returned 
through the float chamber 58 and down through a return 
pipe 60 into the tank. In the filter chamber 57, a drain 
board 61 is laid to be spaced apart from the bottom of the 
chamber. The filter material 59 is placed on the drain 
board 61. Over the filter material 59, a distributing 
trough 62 exends in the longitudinal direction (to the 
left and right in Figure 5) of the filter chamber 57. 
Water discharged from a discharge nozzle 63a of a delivery 
pipe 63 of the pump mechanism 56 first flows into the 
distributing trough 62 to be distributed uniformly over 
the filter material 59 through many distributing holes 
(not shown) formed in the bottom of the trough. The 
filtered water from the filter material 59 flows through a  
 
passage formed between the drain board 61 and the bottom 
of the chamber 57 to enter the float chamber 58 and thence 
return through the return pipe 60 and an outlet 64 into 
the tank. The pump mechanism 56, which pumps water from 
the tank body 51 to the filtering section (i.e., the 
filter chamber 57 with the filter material 59 placed 
therein) comprises a motor 65 mounted in the filter unit 
52, a cylindrical member 66 through which a motor shaft 
(not shown) extends downward from the motor 65 into the 
interior of the tank body 51, an intermediate frame 67 
provided at the lower end of the cylindrical member 66 and 
rotatably accommodating a vane (not shown) mounted at the 
lower end of the motor shaft, an extension pipe 68 
extending from the intermediate frame 67 to communicate 
with the delivery pipe 63 and having its lower end open in 
the tank interior, and a strainer 69 mounted on the lower 
end of the pipe 68 and serving to prevent comparatively 
large particles from being drawn into the pipe 68. The 
water

<CLAIMS>
An aquarium tank comprising a tank body (2) and a water conducting 
section (4) for a pump mechanism associated with a filter unit (3) disposed 

in a case on the tank body (2), said section (4) extending into the tank body 
from said filter unit (3), and further comprising a screen (1) which is 

configured to conceal the water conducting section (4) at least from the 
front and opposite sides of the aquarium,
 
   
characterised in that
 said case of said filter unit is disposed over 
the tank body (2), said water conducting section (4) extends into the tank 

body from the underside of said case of said filter unit and said filter unit (3) 
and said screen (1) are provided with engagement sections (14) for 

engagement with and disengagement from each other, said screen being 
capable of being mounted on and dismounted from said filter unit. 
An aquarium tank according to claim 1, which further includes a 
heater housing (8) for accommodating a heater (5) for regulating the 

temperature of water in said tank.
