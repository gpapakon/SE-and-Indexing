<ABSTRACT>
Valve stem seal comprising a dimensionally stable tube (1), which at the one end is bounded by a first flange (2) projecting radially outwards and at the other end by a cylindrical section (3a), into which a self-retaining sealing ring (2) is inserted parallel to the axis of the tube (1), which ring can be pressed to form a seal with the outer circumference of a valve guide of tubular design surrounding the valve stem and has a sealing lip (4), which extends above the valve guide in an axial direction and touches the valve stem forming a seal, the cylindrical section (3a) overlapping the sealing ring and the sealing lip (4a) over the entire length, the cylindrical section terminating in a second flange (3b) projecting radially inwards and the sealing lip (4a) being spaced at a distance from the cylindrical section (3a) and the second flange (3b) in order to ensure good relative mobility.

A valve stem seal comprising a dimensionally stable 
tube (1) which is bounded at one end by a first flange (2) 

which projects radially outwards and at the other end by a 
cylindrical section (3a) into which there is inserted, 

parallel to the axis of the tube (1) and in a self-locking 
manner, a sealing ring (2) which can be pressed sealingly 

against the outer circumference of a valve guide of tubular 
design surrounding the valve stem and has a sealing lip (4) 

which projects beyond the valve guide in the axial direction 
and touches the valve stem in a sealing manner, the 

cylindrical section (3a) overlapping the sealing ring and 
the sealing lip (4a) over their entire length in the axial 

direction, the sealing lip (4a) being surrounded on the 
outside by a groove, and a garter spring (6) being inserted 

into the groove, characterized in that the cylindrical 
section ends in a radially inward-projecting second flange 

(3b) and in that, to ensure good relative mobility, the 
sealing lip (4a) has a clearance from the cylindrical 

section (3a) and the second flange (3b). 
A valve stem according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sealing ring (4) is composed of a sealing element 

made of elastomeric material and an essentially unyielding 
reinforcing ring (5). 
A valve stem seal according to either of claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that, between the cylindrical section 

(3a) and the first flange (2), the tube has an inside 
diameter which is widened conically in the direction of the 

first flange (2) at at least one point.
