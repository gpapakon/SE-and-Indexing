<ABSTRACT>
In a traction-type elevator equipped with a driving 
sheave (16) positioned at the top of the shaft for 

ascent and descent, cage sheaves (4, 5) are attached to 
the upper section of the cage (2) and are inclined in 

relation to this driving sheave (16), and multiple ropes 
(12, 13, 14) are wound around the outer surface (4a) of 

this cage sheave and the outer surface (16a) of the 
driving sheave. The outer surface (4a) of the cage 

sheave (4) is parallel to the outer surface (16a) of the 
driving sheave (16), and this cage sheave (4) is divided 

into multiple sheave pieces (17, 18, 19) corresponding 
to the ropes (12, 13, 14). The ropes (12, 13, 14) are 

pulled by the driving sheave (16), and even if the cage 
(2) is caused to move upwardly or downwardly at a high 

speed, there is essentially no more generation of 
vibration and noise, because none of the ropes (12, 13, 

14) twists undesirably.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a traction-type elevator 
and particularly to such an elevator in which the cage 
is moved vertically with ropes via a hoist. Figures 4-6 illustrate conventional traction-type 
elevators. In Figures 4 and 5, a cage (101) is arranged 
in a vertically movable manner in a channel (102). A 
pair of sheaves (104) and (105) for the cage is arranged 
through a cage frame (103) on the upper portion of the 
cage (101). Multiple ropes (106), (107), and (108) are 
engaged on cage sheaves (104) and (105). These ropes 
(106), (107), and (108 are also engaged on a driving 
sheave (110) of a hoist (109). Also, one end of ropes 
(106), (107), and (108) is fixed on an overhead beam 
(111), while the other end is fixed on a counterweight 
(112). Of course, the hoist (109) or motor is 
electronically connected to a controller, both connected 
to suitable electrical power sources, all as is well-known. As is well known, the diameter of the sheaves (104) 
and (105) is determined by the size of ropes (106), 
(107), and (108). Consequently, when sheaves (104) and 
(105) are relatively larger, it becomes impossible to 
arrange the sheaves (104) and (105) along the steering 
frame (103). Instead, they must be arranged at an angle 
to frame (103) (that is diagonal to the cage (101)). 
Then, multiple ropes (106), (107), (108) are hung on 
obliquely arranged sheaves (104), (105), and they are 
hung on the driving sheave (110) above the sheave (104). For the conventional traction-type elevator with 
cage sheaves (104) and (105) arranged in the diagonal 
direction of the cage (101), as shown in Figure 6, for 
ropes (106), (107), (108) hung from cage sheave (104) to 
driving sheave (110), the overall shape of the ropes is 
slightly twisted. More specifically, as cage (101)  
 
moves to the upper floors, the amount of twisting of the 
overall of said ropes (106), (107), (108) under the 
action of driving sheave (110), said ropes (106, (107), 
(108) twist. Consequently, vibration and noise take 
place (in particular, when cage (101) moves vertically 
at a high speed). This is a disadvantage. According to one aspect of the present invention, a 
traction-type elevator includes a driving sheave 
arranged in the upper portion of the channel, a cage 
sheave arranged at an angle on the upper side of the 
cage and opposite to said driving sheave, and multiple 
ropes hung on the periphery of said cage and the 
periphery of said driving sheave; in this traction-type 
elevator, the periphery of said cage sheave is
