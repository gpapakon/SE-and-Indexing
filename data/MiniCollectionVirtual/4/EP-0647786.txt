<ABSTRACT>
A linear actuator, adapted especially for 
picking up and transporting workpieces, comprises a 

pneumatic, rodless cylinder (3) having a pair of 
driven elements (8, 16) mounted on opposite sides of 

its body. The first driven element (8) is directly 
connected to the piston (6) of the cylinder (3) via a 

sealed, longitudinal slot (5) formed in the cylinder 
body (1, 2) and the second driven element (16) is 

drivably connected to the piston (6) or first driven 
element (8) by a flexible drive band (24) that passes 

around rollers (20) mounted at opposite ends of the 
cylinder body (1, 2). The driven elements (8, 16) 

therefore move linearly in opposite directions to one 
other upon actuation of the rodless cylinder (3). 
The second driven element (16) may be fixedly 
secured to a stationary structure so that, upon 

actuation of the cylinder (3), the cylinder body 
(1, 2) itself and the first element (8) will 

simultaneously execute linear motion in the same 
direction whereby the first element (8), which may 

have a work piece gripping device mounted on it, will 
in effect execute double its normal stroke length.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluid-powered rodless cylinders, 
especially but not exclusively to pneumatic rodless cylinders. Fluid-powered rodless cylinders are known through their 
widespread industrial use and generally conform to one or other of 
two types. First is the type in which the force-transmitting element is 
directly coupled to the cylinder's piston and is driven, in response to 
movement ofthe piston, along the cylinder's body in the same 
direction as the direction of movement of the piston. European 
patents Nos 0068088 and 0069199, for example, relate to such a type, 
the force-transmitting element being mechanically linked to the piston 
via a sealed longitudinal slot formed in the cylinder's body. Secondly 
is the so-called band or cable type of rodless cylinder, as described for 
example in US patent No 5178056. Here, the piston is linked to the 
force-transmitting element by a band, cable or the like and, as can be 
seen from that US patent, the force-transmitting element moves in a 
direction opposite to that of movement of the piston. It will be appreciated that, in both types of rodless cylinder 
referred to above, the stroke length of the force-transmitting element 
equals the stroke length of the piston. The present invention proposes 
a fluid-powered rodless cylinder which combines features of both 
types of rodless cylinder referred to above and wherein, in one 
application, the force-transmitting element will execute strokes that 
are twice the length of the piston strokes.  
 According to the present invention, there is provided a fluid-powered 
rodless cylinder including an elongate body, a piston 
reciprocably movable within a bore in said body upon the application 
of fluid pressure alternately to opposite ends of the piston, and a first 
force-transmitting element mounted externally of the body on or 
adjacent to one side thereof and reciprocably drivable by, and in the 
same direction as, the piston longitudinally of the body, characterised 
in that the cylinder further includes a second force-transmitting 
element mounted externally of said body on or adjacent to a side 
thereof opposite to said first side and reciprocably movable 
longitudinally of the body, and flexible drive means connected to the 
first force-transmitting element or the piston and to the second force-transmitting 
element, the flexible drive means extending 
longitudinally of the body and around bearing means located at 
opposite ends of the body, whereby movement of the piston in 
response to the

A fluid-powered rodless cylinder including an elongate body 
(1, 2), a piston (6) reciprocably movable within a bore (4) in said 

body (1, 2) upon the application of fluid pressure alternately to 
opposite ends of the piston (6), and a first force-transmitting element 

(8) mounted externally of the body (1, 2) on or adjacent to one side 
thereof and reciprocably drivable by, and in the same direction as, the 

piston (6) longitudinally of the body (1, 2),

mounted externally of the body (1, 2) on or adjacent to a side thereof 
opposite to said first side and reciprocably movable longitudinally of 

the body (1, 2), and flexible drive means (24) connected to the first force-transmitting 
element (8) or the piston (6) and to the second force-transmitting 

element (16), the flexible drive means (24) extending longitudinally 
of the body (1, 2) and around bearing means (20) located at opposite 

ends of the body (1, 2), whereby movement of the piston (6) in 
response to the application of fluid pressure thereto causes the second 

force-transmitting element (16) simultaneously to move 
longitudinally of the body (1, 2) in a direction opposite to the 

direction of movement of the piston (6) and the first force-transmitting 
element (8). 
A cylinder according to claim 1 wherein the second force-transmitting 
element (16) partially surrounds the cylinder body (1, 2)

said force-transmitting elements (8 or 16) has means (42) for fixedly 

securing it to a structure (25) whereby, in use, movement of the piston 
(6) upon the application of fluid pressure thereto will cause the 

cylinder body (1, 2) simultaneously to move linearly relative to said 
one force-transmitting element (8 or 16) and said structure (25) in the 

same direction as the direction of movement of the piston (6) and the
