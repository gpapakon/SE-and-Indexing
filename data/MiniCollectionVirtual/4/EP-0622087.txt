<ABSTRACT>
The device for injecting a sterile and pyrogen-free fluid comprises:     - at least one main filter (15) having a first compartment (16) and a second compartment (17) which are separated by a porous membrane (18), the first compartment (16) having an inlet which can be connected to a source (11) of fluid to be filtered, and the second compartment (17) having an outlet connected to an injection channel (22), - means (23) for circulating the fluid through the main filter (15) and into the injection channel (22), and - means (25, 26, 27) for checking the integrity of the main filter, comprising: - a secondary filter (24) which is able to hold back bacteria and pyrogens and which is arranged in the injection channel (22), and - means (25, 26, 27) for detecting any clogging of the secondary filter (24) during the injection of fluid.   A particular application of the invention is in the case where the injected fluid is dialysis fluid sterilised on line in order to be injected as a replacement fluid.
