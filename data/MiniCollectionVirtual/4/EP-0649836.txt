production by which high-purity N-(long-chain 

acyl)amino acid and salt thereof can be prepared from 
inexpensive raw materials.

catalyst to form an amidonitrile (1), the amidonitrile 
(1) is hydrolyzed into an N-(long-chain acyl)amino 

acid salt (4) in the presence of a basic substance, 
the pH of the resulting aqueous solution is adjusted 

to a pH from 1 to 5 with a mineral acid to form an 
N-(long-chain acyl)amino acid (5), and this amino acid 

is recovered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intermediate
amidonitrile and a process for the preparation thereof
for use in a process for the preparation of an N-(long-chain
acyl) amino acid and a process for the preparation
of a salt of an N-(long-chain acyl)amino acid.More particularly, the present invention
relates to a process suitable for industrial
production by which an amidonitrile, N-(long-chain
acyl)amino acid or a salt thereof each having a high
purity can be prepared from inexpensive raw materials
through simple and easy operation independently of the
material of the reactor used.N-(Long-chain acyl)amino acids and salts thereof
are used in various fields, because they are excellent
in surface activating effect and bacteriostatic 
activity and are low in irritant effects.As a process for the preparation of an N-(long-chain
acyl)amino acid salt, there has hitherto been
known the Schotten-Baumann reaction which comprises
reacting an amino acid with a fatty acid halide in the
presence of an alkali, and further several
improvements of the reaction have also been proposed.
Furthermore, there has also been known a reaction of
converting the salt prepared by the above reaction
into an N-(long-chain acyl)amino acid through double
decomposition with a strong acid.These reactions are represented by the following
reaction scheme:

wherein RCO- represents a long-chain acyl group; and
R' represents an alkylene group having 1 to 5 carbon
atoms.However, the Schotten-Baumann reaction and the
improvements thereof must use, as the raw materials,
an amino acid and a fatty acid halide, which are too
expensive for industrial use. Further, the use of a
fatty acid halide limits the material of the
preparation apparatus used. It has also been known that the quality of a
fatty acid halide greatly influences the quality of
the N-(long-chain acyl)amino acid prepared therefrom
[see Japanese Patent Publication-A Nos. 4-321656
(published on Nov. 11, 1992) and 5-97787 (published on
April 20, 1993)]. Therefore, the preparation of an
N-(long-chain acyl)amino acid or salt thereof each
having a high quality necessitates complicated steps,
disadvantageously.Meanwhile, Shirai et al. disclosed a process for
the preparation of an N-(long-chain acyl)amino acid or
a salt thereof which comprises acylating an
aminonitrile with an acid chloride and then
hydrolyzing the obtained product [see Yuki Gosei
Kagaku (Organic Synthetic Chemistry), Vol. 30, No. 1,
p.p. 68-75, 1972].However, the process of Shirai et al. also uses
an acid chloride as the
