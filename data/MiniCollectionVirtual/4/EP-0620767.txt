<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for internal cleaning of elongated closed 
channels, or ducts, preferably ventilation ducts. It is previously known to clean, for instance, ventilation ducts, or channels, by moving 
a brush backwards and forwards in the ventilation duct, so as to remove dirt that has adhered 
to the duct walls. It is also known to inspect such ducts with the aid of an automatic vehicle 
equipped with an inspection camera. The drawback with these known devices is that they 
cannot be used simultaneously, and consequently it is not possible to inspect the result of a 
cleaning operation until the brush has been withdrawn from the duct. If the inspection reveals 
an unsatisfactory result, it is necessary to reinsert the brush into the duct and carry out a 
supplementary cleaning operation, this supplementary cleaning operation being effected by 
"guess work" with the guidance of what was revealed by the inspection. The applicant has earlier invented a device, presented in the magazine RENT, No. 2-1989, 
page 17, "Robot cleans ventilation". This prior device has a rotary brush, rotatable 
around an axle extending in longitudinal direction of the vehicle, carrying the brush. The 
device has its best effect in tubular ducts, but has also been used in rectangular ducts, pressing 
the brush against the walls to come so close as possible into the corners of the rectangular duct, 
but the efficiency of the cleaning in the corners is very poor. There are also other devices 
having a brush or wire rotating around an longitudinal axle, but they also have the same 
problem of reaching into the corners of the duct. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a novel duct cleaning device 
which will enable the duct to be inspected during a duct cleaning operation and a supplementary 
cleaning operation to be carried out when so necessary. The object of the invention has been realized with a device having the characteristic 
features set forth in the following claims. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to a non-limiting 
exemplifying embodiment thereof illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in  
 
which Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of an 
device equipped for the internal cleaning of 
ducts of round internal cross-section; and Figure 2 is a 
schematic perspective view of an inventive device 
equipped for the internal cleaning of ducts having a 
square internal cross-section. The device illustrated in Figure 1 is intended 
for cleaning
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for internally cleaning elongated closed ducts or channels, particularly ventilation 
ducts, including an automotive vehicle (1) and a rotary brush (6; 9) mounted thereon, and a 

TV-camera (16) or some comparable device mounted on the vehicle (1) for monitoring the 
result of a cleaning operation, 
characterized
 in that the rotary brush (9) is mounted 
for rotation around a shaft (10) which extends generally transversely in relation to the 

longitudinal direction of the vehicle (1). 
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the rotary brush (6; 9) is 

mounted on the vehicle (1) by means of a raisable and lowerable stand structure (8). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the vehicle (1) is driven 
electrically and in that the rotary brush (6; 9) is driven by compressed air. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that the 
vehicle (1) is a band-driven vehicle. 
A device according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the vehicle drive bands are 
guided upwards over guide rollers (3) at respective ends of the vehicle (1); and in that the 

diameters of the guide rollers are smaller than the diameters of band-supporting wheels or 
rollers (4) and are positioned at a higher level than the band-supporting wheels (4) so that the 

drive bands (2) at respective ends of the vehicle (1) have an obliquely and upwardly directed 
run and therewith enable the vehicle (1) to pass minor obstacles more easily.
