<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to optical couplers. 
Specifically, the invention is directed to a monolithic 
multiple channel optical coupler. Existing optical couplers generally exhibit a 
variation in performance from device to device. For 
example, the current transfer ratio and speed of an optical 
device can vary significantly. This can pose a significant 
problem when one is coupling multiple channels and minimal 
device-to-device variation is needed to preserve relative 
channel signal levels. Part of the problem can be minimized by using multiple 
channel couplers. However, since the individual optical 
devices within such couplers may be fabricated from 
different wafers or different portions of the same wafer, 
they are not necessarily matched devices. Further, such 
couplers may not use isolated optical paths for the devices 
to minimize cross-talk. Thus, even within one package, 
performance variations persist. It would be helpful therefore to provide a coupler 
that can handle multiple signals with minimal channel-to-channel 
variation in signal transfer performance. Also, it 
is desirable to provide a coupler that has the maximum 
number of isolated channels using the least number of pins, 
to reduce assembly costs and to reduce the required printed 
circuit board space. These and other objects are achieved by a monolithic-detector, 
multiple-channel optical coupler having common 
LED-emitter cathodes and common photodetector collectors, 
or having common LED-emitter anodes and common 
photodetector emitters. The photodetectors are contained  
 
on a single, monolithic substrate which provides 
substantially-matched devices and common connections for 
the devices. Although the individual coupling devices 
share electrical commonality, they are optically isolated 
by the use of a light pipe arrangement between the LED-emitters 
and the photodetectors. Moreover, pin count is 
minimized by using common connections for the LED-emitters 
and the photodetectors. A more complete understanding of the present 
invention, as well as other objects and advantages thereof 
not enumerated herein, will become apparent upon 
consideration of the following detailed description and the 
accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Figure 1 is an electrical schematic diagram of a 
monolithic-detector, multiple-channel optical coupler 
constructed in accordance with the present invention; Figure 2 is a top-view of a substrate containing 
photodetectors of the coupler of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a front-elevation partial
