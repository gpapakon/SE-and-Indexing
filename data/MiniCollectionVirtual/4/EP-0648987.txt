<ABSTRACT>
A sliding closure, having at least two sliding lids (1-1, 1-2) with frames (2) and panels (3) in closed chest refrigerators or freezers, contains, for the automatic opening and closing of the sliding lids (1-1, 1-2), in each case an electric motor (4) for the controlled displacement of each sliding lid (1-1, 1-2), in each case an infrared transmitter (6-1, 6-2) per sliding slid (1-1, 1-2) and an electrical control unit (7) which is connected to the electric motors (4) and the infrared transmitters (6-1, 6-2) for the automatic displacement of the sliding lids (1-1, 1-2).

Chest freezer with a sliding lid closure which has at
least two sliding lids (1-1, 1-2) with frames (2) and panes

(3), characterised by

an electric motor (4) each for controlled sliding of
each sliding lid (1-1, 1-2),
an infrared indicator (6-1, 6-2) for each sliding lid
(1-1, 1-2), and
an electrical control device (7) connected to the
electric motors and the infrared indicators (6-1, 6-2)

for automatically sliding the sliding lids (6-1, 6-2).
Chest freezer with a sliding lid closure which has at
least two sliding lids (1-1, 1-2) with frames (2) and panes

(3), characterised by

an electric motor (4) each for controlled sliding of
each sliding lid (1-1, 1-2),
a soft touch panel or mechanical key for each sliding
lid (1-1, 1-2), and
an electrical control device (7) connected to the
electric motors and the soft touch panels or

mechanical keys for automatically sliding the sliding
lids (6-1, 6-2).
Chest freezer according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that two sliding lids (1-1, 1-2) running one over the

other are provided.
Chest freezer according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that each sliding lid (1-1, 1-2) rests

with its frame portion (10) facing away from the user of
the chest freezer in friction-locking relationship on a

toothed belt (8) which is driven by the associated electric 
motor (4) and coated for sliding capacity on its toothed

side.
Chest freezer according to claim 4, characterised in
that a gear mechanism (9) is connected between the electric

motor (4) and the toothed belt (8).
Chest freezer according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the electric motors (4) are arranged

on the side facing away from the user of the chest freezer
and connected in driving relationship by pinions (15) to

racks (16), wherein the two ends of the racks (16) are
connected by cables and guide means to the side portions of

the frames (2) of the sliding lids (1-1, 1-2).
Chest freezer according to claim 1 or a claim referring
back to claim 1, characterised in that the infrared

indicators (6-1, 6-2) are mounted on a frame profile (5) of
the chest freezer on the side facing towards the user of

the chest freezer in the region of the side edges of the
closed sliding lids (1-1, 1-2).
Chest freezer according to claim 1 or a claim referring
back to claim 1, characterised in that the infra
red
indicators (6-1, 6-2) have a frontal range of approximately

40 cm.
Chest freezer according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that for each sliding lid (1-1, 1-2) at

the end faces in the region of the corners of the frame (2)
in the frame portions (12, 10) facing towards and away from

the user of the chest freezer in each corner is embedded a
ball roller (11) and on the lower side of the frame portion

(12) facing towards the user centrally is embedded an 
additional ball roller (13).
Chest freezer according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that for each sliding lid (1-1, 1-2), two

inductive proximity switches (14) for detecting the end
positions of each sliding lid (1-1, 1-2) are provided.
Chest freezer according to claim 10, characterised in
that the inductive proximity switches (14) are provided at

the corners of a frame profile (5) of the chest freezer on
the side facing towards the user and can be operated by

metal contactors on the sliding lids (1-1, 1-2).
Chest freezer according to claim 10 or 11,
characterised in that the inductive proximity switches (14)

are connected to the control device (7).
Chest freezer according to claim 1 or a claim referring
back to claim 1, characterised in that the control device

(7) contains a circuit for alternately opening and closing
the sliding lids (1-1, 1-2) as a function of the response

of the associated infrared indicators (6-1, 6-2), wherein
the first infrared indicator (6-1) to respond, for opening

one sliding lid (1-1) associated with it during the period
of its response, performs a locking action on the process

of opening of the other sliding lid (6-2).
Chest freezer according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the control device (7) contains a

circuit for detecting an overload of the electric motors
(4) and switching off the electric motors (4).
Chest freezer according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the control signal (7) contains a 

circuit for detecting an excessively long running time of
the electric motors (4) before reaching the end positions

of the sliding lids (1-1, 1-2) and repeatedly switching the
electric motors (4) on and off in case of an excessively

long running time as well as finally switching off the
electric motors (4) after a repeated excessively long

running time and transmitting a fault message.
Chest freezer according to claim 15, characterised in
that the fault message is acoustic and/or visual and urges

resumption of operation after elimination of the fault.
Chest freezer according to claim 10, characterised in
