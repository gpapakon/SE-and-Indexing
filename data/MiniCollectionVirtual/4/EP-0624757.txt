<ABSTRACT>
Impingement cooling of a jet engine subassembly, 
such as a combustor. Adjacent raised corrugation 

portions and intervening plate portions (having 
impingement cooling holes [50]
) of a corrugated plate [40] define 

coolant channels [54,62] in fluid communication with the engine 

compressor. Dividers [56] positioned transverse to the 

corrugation portions have a top side attached to a 
bottom surface of the plate portions and have a bottom 

side attached to the combustor liner [36]. Corrugation 

portions define therewithin return channels [62] in fluid 

communication with post-impingement cooling air. The 
dividers prevent crossflow between the impingement 

cooling air and the post-impingement cooling air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cooling 
of jet engine components, and more particularly to 
impingement cooling of such components. The phrase 
"jet engine" includes gas turbine, ramjet, and scramjet 
engines. Such jet engines may be used to power flight 
vehicles, and the gas turbine engine type of jet engine 
may also be used to power ships, tanks, electric power 
generators, pipeline pumping apparatus, etc. For 
purposes of illustration, the invention will be 
described with respect to impingement cooling of an 
aircraft gas turbine engine component using cooling 
air. However, it is understood that the invention is 
equally applicable to impingement cooling of other 
types of jet engines (such as scramjets) and/or to 
impingement cooling using other cooling fluids (such as 
liquid fuel, water, steam, and the like). A gas turbine engine includes a core engine having 
a high pressure compressor to compress the air flow 
entering the core engine, a combustor in which a 
mixture of fuel and the compressed air is burned to 
generate a hot propulsive gas flow, and a high pressure 
turbine which is rotated by the propulsive gas flow and 
which is connected by a shaft to drive the high 
pressure compressor. Engine thrust comes from the core  
 
engine airflow after it flows through the high 
pressure compressor to the combustor and is expanded 
past the high pressure turbine and out the exhaust 
nozzle. A gas turbine engine, such as an aircraft 
turbofan jet engine, may include other components, such 
as a thrust producing fan, a low pressure compressor, 
and a low pressure turbine. Certain components of gas turbine engines, such as 
combustor liners, turbine airfoils (i.e., blades and 
vanes) and shrouds, and exhaust nozzles, are subjected 
to hot combustion gases. Current engine designs 
require that such components be cooled to keep their 
temperatures within design limits. A known technique 
for cooling gas turbine engine components is 
impingement cooling of a component wall surface, such 
as impingement cooling of a back surface of a 
combustor liner whose front surface is exposed to hot 
combustion gases. In this technique, a plate is 
spaced apart from the impingement cooled surface (e.g., 
the liner) and contains impingement cooling holes 
through which pressurized impingement cooling air flows 
in a jet-like fashion, impinging generally 
perpendicularly against the surface to be cooled (i.e., 
the impingement cooled surface, such as the liner). 
The "spent" cooling air (i.e., the
