<ABSTRACT>
Spergualin-related compounds and their synthetic inter­
mediates are purified by electrodialysis and/or reverse 

osmosis. Solutions of such compound or intermediate 
containing inorganic salt (due to elution with inorganic 

salt solution) can be desalinated by electrodialysis 
and then concentrated by reverse osmosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
the purification of spergualin-related compounds which are 
useful as antitumor or immunosuppressive substances, 
and of their synthetic intermediates. Spergualin is a antitumor antibiotic discovered by 
H. Umezawa et al (Japanese Patent Kokai No. 48957/82), and 
many derivatives and analogues of spergualin have been reported 
(Japanese Patent Kokai No. 62152/83, No. 42356/84, No. 185758/85, 
and No. 48660/87). In addition, the immunosuppressive activity 
of spergualin and its related compounds has been reported 
(Japanese Patent Kokai No. 129119/86). These spergualin-related 
compounds are produced by cultivation, semi-synthesis, 
or total synthesis. Among spergualin, its derivatives, and its analogues 
(hereinafter referred to as spergualin-related compounds), 
spergualin and 15-deoxyspergualin, which have excellent biological 
activity, are relatively unstable, and so it has been 
extremely difficult to produce a large amount of sample of 
high quality. Spergualin-related compounds, their 
synthetic intermediate, glyoxylylspermidine, and their 
derivatives readily decompose on concentration by 
heating. There 
are problems in removing inorganic salt from 
active fractions and/or in concentrating fractions 
containing spergualin-related compounds eluted from 
ion-exchange and porous absorbent resin 
columns by aqueous inorganic salts. In 
concentration and desalination, evaporation  
 
or freeze-drying and extraction with organic solvent have been 
avoidable steps, because other processes suitable for 
spergualin-related compounds were not available. Thus, to help 
prevent degradation, concentration had to be at low temperature with 
small portion or by freeze-drying, reducing productivity. A process 
that includes such a concentration step is not useable for 
industrial-scale production. Since the known processes of 
concentration and/or desalination were not applicable to large-scale 
production, effective and economical methods have been needed. Chemical Engineering Progress vol. 80, no. 12, December 1984, 
pages 47 to 50, discloses the purification of protein solutions by 
electrodialysis. Chemical Abstracts, vol. 97, no. 7, August 16, 1982, page 508, 
abstract 54185 discloses the desalination of soya bean hydrolisates 
by electrodialysis. Chemical Abstracts, vol. 104, no. 22, June 2, 1986, page 443, 
abstract 193230x, discloses the concentration of β-lactum antibiotic 
solution by reverse osmosis. Chemical Abstracts, vol. 87, no. 24, December 12, 1977, page
