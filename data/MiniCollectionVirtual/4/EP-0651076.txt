<ABSTRACT>
The phase transformation temperature of a metal silicide layer 
formed overlying a silicon layer on a semiconductor wafer is 

lowered. First, a refractory metal is disposed proximate to 
the surface of the silicon layer, a precursory metal is 

deposited in a layer overlying the refractory metal, and the 
wafer is heated to a temperature sufficient to form the metal 

silicide from the precursory metal. The precursory metal may 
be a refractory metal, and is preferably titanium, tungsten, 

or cobalt. The concentration of the refractory metal at the 
surface of the silicon layer is preferably less than about 

10¹⁷ atoms/cm³. The refractory metal may be Mo, Co, W, Ta, 
Nb, Ru, or Cr, and more preferably is Mo or Co. The heating 

step used to form the silicide is performed at a temperature 
less than about 700°C, and more preferably between about 600-700°C. 

Optionally, the wafer is annealed following the step 
of disposing the refractory metal and prior to the step of 

depositing the precursory metal layer. Preferably, this 
annealing step is performed at a wafer temperature of at least 

about 900°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit
devices and, more particularly, to a method for forming a
metal silicide layer overlying a silicon layer in an
integrated circuit device where the phase transformation
temperature of the metal silicide has been reduced by the use
of a second refractory metal.Titanium silicide has become the most widely-used silicide in
the VLSI industry for self-aligned silicide applications
because of its combined characteristics of low resistivity,
the ability to be self-aligned, and relatively good thermal
stability. Although TiSi2 has certain advantages relative to
other silicides, the fact that it is a polymorphic material
presents additional problems in its use. Specifically, in
typical use TiSi2 exists as either an orthorhombic base-centered
phase having 12 atoms per unit cell and a resistivity
of about 60-90 micro-ohm-cm (known in the industry as the C49
phase), or as a more thermodynamically-favored orthorhombic
face-centered phase which has 24 atoms per unit cell and a
resistivity of about 12-20 micro-ohm-cm (known as the C54
phase). When using the generally-accepted processing
conditions for forming titanium silicide, the less-desirable,
higher-resistivity C49 phase is formed first. In order to
obtain the lower-resistivity C54 phase, a second high-temperature
annealing step is required. This second step is disadvantageous because it can have
detrimental effects on the silicide and other integrated
circuit elements, especially at smaller line-widths. For
example, the increasing use of dual-doped polysilicon gate
structures in some devices has increased their sensitivity to
additional heat cycles, as is required by the second anneal
step. Also, silicon nitride peeling and cracking have been
associated with the second annealing step.The generally accepted set of processing conditions for
forming titanium silicide include: (1) pre-cleaning, (2)
titanium deposition, (3) silicide formation at a temperature
less than about 700°C, (4) selective etching, and (5) a phase
transformation anneal at a temperature greater than about
700°C. It is the phase transformation anneal that converts
the dominant C49 phase to the C54 phase. The initial
formation temperature is kept below 700°C in order to minimize
over-spacer bridging. The second transformation anneal is
performed after any un-reacted titanium has been selectively
removed and is generally performed at temperatures of 50-200°C
above the formation temperature to insure full transformation
to the C54 phase
