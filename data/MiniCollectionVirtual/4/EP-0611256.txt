<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveying system with at least two equidistant conveyor chains (1, 2). So that the chain links of the conveyor chains (1, 2) also move synchronously on those parts of the conveying path in which the radii of curvature of the individual chain arrangements differ from one another, the chain-link spacings (d, d') can be matched by corresponding control means (13, 14) to the ratio between the radii of curvature of the individual chain arrangements.

Conveying system with conveyor chains having a plurality of chain links, 
said system having at least two conveyor chains, which over at least part 

of the conveying path are synchronously movable on equidistant chain paths 
in that on the chain path parts on which the equidistant chain paths have 

different radii of curvature, the links of at least one part of the conveyor 
chains are so designed that the spacings between in each case two 

identical points on in each case two following links is adaptable to the 
ratio of the radii of curvature of the equidistant chain paths, characterized 

in that the system has a first conveyor chain (1), whose links are 
interconnected and have a fixed link spacing (d), and that it has at least 

one further conveyor chain (2), whose links can be brought by control means 
(L, V) into a mutually released and a mutually connected state, in each 

case one link of the first conveyor chain (1) being connected by in each 
case one link of each further conveyor chain (2) by a connecting element 

(10) and in which the links of the further conveyor chains (2) in the connected 
state have the same link spacing (d) as the links of the first chain 

and in the released state have a link spacing which is larger, smaller or 
the same as the link spacing (d) of the connected state. 
Conveying system according to claim 1, characterized in that it has 
conveying path parts with equidistant chain paths and conveying path parts 

with individually running chain paths. 
Conveying system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
links of the further conveyor chains (2) are so designed that the chain, in 

addition to a state (G) with connected links and with a link spacing (d), 
which is the same as the link spacing of the first conveyor chain (1), 

can have further such states (G') in which the link spacing (d') is larger 
or smaller than the link spacing of the first conveyor chain. 
Conveying system according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the links of at least the further conveyor chains have two rollers 

(51, 52), which are spaced from one another in the conveying direction and 
perpendicular thereto and that they have coupling elements (55) movably  

 
arranged in such a way that they can be brought by corresponding control 

means into the vicinity of rollers of adjacent chain links. 
Conveying system according to claim 4, characterized in that the coupling 
elements (55) are arranged pivotably about the
 axis of one roller (51) 
and on one coupling arm (58) is provided an indentation, which can be connected 

to a roller spindle (59). 
Conveying system according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the 
coupling elements (55) have control rolls (56), which roll on control 

links on at least parts of the conveying path. 
Conveying system according to claim 5, characterized in that the link 
spacing (d) of the first conveyor chain is the same as the spacing (a) in 

the conveying direction between the rollers of each link of the further 
conveyor chains. 
Conveyor chain, comprising a plurality of links for a conveying system 
according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that each link has 

a controllably movable coupling element with the aid of which it can be 
brought into a releasable connection with a neighbouring link. 
Conveyor chain according to claim 8, characterized in that each link has 
two rollers (51, 52), which in the conveying direction and perpendicular 

thereto are spaced from one another and that the links have coupling 
elements (55, 70), which are connectable with a roller spindle (59).
