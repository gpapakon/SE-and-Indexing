<ABSTRACT>
A device for rapidly accessing circulating blood by simplifying the positioning and withdrawal of extracorporeal surrogate-type circulatory support systems. The device consists of an implantable member (1) comprising a rigid tubular structure (2) with a textured polyester rim (3) allowing suturing in anatomical structures and containing an elastomeric diaphragm (4) with slots for the insertion of a plastic-tipped plastic cannula (5) provided with a nut and surrounded by a removable flexible elastomeric tube (6) joining said member (1) to the patient's skin. The tube (6) is provided with a rigid cylindrical plastic portion (7) with a polyester rim (8), as well as a protective sealing plastic cap (9).

DEVICE FOR RAPID ACCESS TO THE BLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM, 
comprising an implantable member (1) constituted by a rigid tubular 

structure (2), provided with a texturized polyester border (3), for 
sewing into the anatomical structures and containing, within it, an 

elastomeric diaphragm (4), with slots and a nut, to permit the passage 
of a plastic canula (5) with a plastic point provided with a thread, the 

said structure (2) being surrounded by a removable flexible tube (6) of 
elastomer, which connects the said member (1) with the skin of the 

patient; said tube (6) being provided with a cylindrical segment of 
rigid plastic (7) with a polyester border (8) and being provided also 

swith a plastic plug (9) for protection and insulation.
