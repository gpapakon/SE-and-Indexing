<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a process for producing a hybrid integrated optical circuit. According to the process one uses a shaping tool (3) with receptacle-forming devices (4) for an electro-optical semiconductor component (2) and negative moulds (5) for a waveguide channel (9) and receptacle-forming devices (12) for a light-guide (10). The receptacle-forming devices (4) of the shaping tool (3) adjust the electro-optical semiconductor component (2) in relation to the negative mould (5) of the waveguide channel (9) during shaping with a polymer. The basic unit (13) produced consists of the electro-optical semiconductor component (2) which is adjusted in relation to the waveguide channel (9) formed in the polymer. The waveguide channel (9) is connected to receptacle-forming devices (6) shaped in the polymer by means of which a light-guide (10) can be self-adjustingly coupled to the waveguide channel. The basic unit (13) and the light-guide (10) are firmly secured together by means of a covering (7), the waveguide channel (9) being filled with an optically transparent material, thus providing a wave-guide (20).
