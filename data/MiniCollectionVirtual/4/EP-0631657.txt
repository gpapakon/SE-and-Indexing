Sealing element for openings provided in an 
outside wall of a tiled stove, having an outer frame 

(3) which is retained in the outside wall and a door 
frame (1) which is detachably connected to this outer 

frame (3) and in which an openable door is movably 
arranged, characterised in that the outer frame (3) 

consists of two closed angular frame portions (4, 5) 
which can be shifted relative to each other 

perpendicularly with respect to the plane of the door 
frame, can be fixed in their mutual position, and are 

formed by overlapping wall elements (6, 8) extending in 
planes which are perpendicular with respect to the 

plane of the door frame, said wall elements having 
flanges (7, 9) which protrude outwards. 
Sealing element according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the two frame portions (4, 5) are 

connected to each other by screws (10) which are fixed 
to shoulders (13) provided on the wall elements (6, 8). 
Sealing element according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the flanges (9) of the frame 

portion (5) that is connected to the door frame (1) 
have retaining means for securing the door frame (1). 
Sealing element according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the flanges (9) of the frame 

portion (5) that is connected to the door frame (1) are 
provided with threaded bores (14), into which can be 

screwed screws (16) which penetrate openings (15) of 
the door frame (1). 
Sealing element according to one of the claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the door frame (1) is 

provided, on the outer edge, with a projection (21) 
which laterally surrounds the flanges (9) of the frame 

portion (5) that is connected to the door frame (1). 
Sealing element according to one of the claims 
1 to 5, for sealing an opening provided in the outside  

 
wall of a tiled stove, characterised in that one of the 

frame portions (4) is provided with stop bars (19) for 
a spark-protection grating (17) which protrude into the 

interior of the frame, the spark-protection grating 
being mounted so as to be pivotable around a vertical 

swivel pin (18) and shiftable in the direction of this 
swivel pin (18), and being provided, on the side which 

is opposite the swivel pin (18), with an edge-open 
recess (20), through which a stop bar (19) can be 

guided only after the spark-protection grating (17) has 
been shifted upwards, as a result of which it becomes 

possible for the spark-protection grating (17) to 
swivel out of the closed position into an open 

position.
