<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for removing flashes on pieces of plastic by blasting with plastic granules consists of a conveyor to move the plastic pieces, a blasting device which pelts the pieces of plastic with plastic granules, a collector, conveyor and separator to handle the plastic granules, and a means of removing from the plastic granules the static charge generated by the process. To devise this apparatus with an inexpensive means of effecting a static discharge of the plastic granules, it is proposed that ion spray rods and/or ion spray jets (13) be distributed over the circuit as a means of neutralizing the static charge on the plastic granules (12, 14, 15).

A device for removing flashes on plastic parts by means 
of blasting with plastic granulate, consisting of a 

conveying means for conveying the plastic parts, a 
blasting device having blasting means which are disposed 

surrounding the conveying means and fling the plastic 
granulate to the pla
stic parts, a collecting device for 
collecting the plastic granulate, a conveying device 

for the plastic granulate, by means of which it can be 
transferred via a transferring device to a separating 

device, in which plastic granulate and residue of the 
plastic parts can be separated, a subordinate wind 

separating device, by means of which adhering dust can be 
removed and separated from the plastic granulate, and 

also a conveying device, which where appropriate is 
buffered by an intermediate storage basin, by means of 

which the cleaned plastic granulate can be supplied again 
to the blasting device, with means being provided by 

means of which the static charging of the plastic 
granulate caused by the process can be reduced,
characterised in that
 ion spray bars and/or ion spray 
nozzles (13) are disposed distributed over the 

circulation path of the plastic granulate as means for 
the neutralization of the static charge off the plastic 

granulate (12, 14, 15). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 ion spray bars (12) are disposed in 
the region off the blasting means (at 5) of the blasting 

device (4, 5). 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 ion spray nozzles (13), the ion 
spray jet of which is directed especially to the passing  

 
plastic parts, are disposed in the region of the 

collecting device (6, 8) for the plastic granulate. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 ion spray bars (14) are disposed 
following the conveying device (8) for the plastic 

granulate, especially in the region of the transfer 
device (9). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 ion spray bars (15) are disposed in 
the separating haze of the wind separating device (11).
