<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an agitator mill which, on the outlet side of the grinding space, has both a static separating arrangement and a dynamic separating arrangement. These two separating arrangements complement one another ideally as, in the start-up phase, in particular the dynamic separating arrangement ensures a fault-free start while, in running operation, the static separating arrangement enlarges the overall effective passage opening in a desirable manner and thus leads to low pressure in the mill. The agitator mill according to the invention is thus characterised by high operational safety, low maintenance expenditure, low wear and universal applicability.

<CLAIMS>
Agitator mill for wet comminution of mill feed material using
auxiliary grinding elements (27), comprising


a) a grinding chamber (6) to which fresh mill feed material is delivered
on the inlet side (15) and from the outlet side (26) of which

comminuted mill feed material is extracted.
b) a static separating arrangement (20) disposed on the outlet side (26)
of the grinding chamber (6) and having at least one opening (20a)

defined by elements which are not movable relative to one another,
c) a dynamic separating arrangement which is also provided on the
outlet side (26) of the grinding chamber (6), which has at least one

opening (25) and which is formed by a ring (32) which is disposed
substantially stationary and a rotating ring 33),
d) the width of the openings (20a, 25) of both separating arrangements
being dimensioned so that the comminuted mill feed material passes

through but the auxiliary grinding elements (27) are retained,

characterised in that
e) in order to compensate for eccentric manufacturing tolerances the
ring (32) which is disposed substantially stationary is mounted

floating in a recess (35) in the housing (1).
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the substantially
stationary ring (32) and the rotating ring (33) are made from wear-resistant

material and define a friction gap (25) forming the opening.
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 2, characterised by the following
features:


a) a rotor (22) which is firmly connected to a hub body (21) projects as
a displacement body into a recess (13) in the housing (1):
b) the peripheral wall (11) of the recess (13) together with the peripheral
wall (14) of the rotor (22) defines the gap-shaped grinding chamber

(6).
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the static
separating arrangement is formed by a preferably cylindrical or conical bar

screen (20).
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the static
separating arrangement (20) is stationary.
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the static
separating arrangement (20) is borne by a part (28, 29) which rotates when

the mill is in operation.
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that elements
(36) for the turbulent motion of the suspension formed by the mill feed

material and the auxiliary grinding elements (27) are connected so as to be 
fixed against rotation to the static separating arrangement (20) on the side

thereof facing the grinding chamber (6).
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that the elements
which serve for the turbulent motion of the suspension are constructed as

helical centrifugal vanes (36) and are arranged so that entrained auxiliary
grinding elements (27) are carried away from the dynamic separating

arrangement by the centrifugal vanes.
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the opening
(20a) of the static separating arrangement (20) and the opening (25) of the

dynamic separating arrangement are dimensioned so as to be of different
widths.
Agitator mill as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the opening
(25) of the dynamic separating arrangement has a width which is 1/4 to 1/3

of the diameter of the auxiliary grinding elements (27).
