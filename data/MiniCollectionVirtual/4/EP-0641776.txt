<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new thioglycerol derivative. With 
immunoenhancing and platelet increasing activity, the thioglycerol 
derivative of the present invention serves well as a prophylactic/therapeutic 
agent for various diseases such as leukocytopenia, which is caused by various 
causes, diseases resulting from leukocyte reduction, diseases therapeutically 
necessitating an increase in bone marrow cells or leukocytes, 
thrombocytopenia, diseases resulting from platelet reduction, and diseases 
therapeutically necessitating an increase in megakaryocytes or platelets. As a thioglycerol compound possessing leukocyte increasing activity, 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 46194/1992 describes the 
substance WS-1279A, represented by the formula: 
   Synthesis of WS-1279A was reported by Tsuda et al. [Chemical 
Pharmaceutical Bulletin, Vol. 39, pp. 607-611 (1991)] and Achiwa et al. 
[Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 99796/1992; Chemical 
Pharmaceutical Bulletin, Vol. 39, pp. 2590-2596 (1991); Peptide Chemistry, 
pp. 361-366 (1991)]. In addition, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication 
Nos. 9224/1979, 139348/1984, 6410/1990 and 9397/1992, Japanese Patent 
Examined Publication No. 60760/1988 and other publications describe 
thioglycerol compounds, but none describes leukocyte increasing activity. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy on cancer patients can cause severe 
leukocytopenia or thrombocytopenia. Leukocytopenia, which results in 
impaired resistance to infectious and other diseases, and thrombocytopenia, 
which results in hemostatic dysfunction, both pose a major therapeutic 
problem that no satisfactory therapeutic effect is obtained. There is therefore 
a need for a drug that promotes recovery of leukocyte or platelet count. There 
is another need for a drug offering rapid recovery of leukocyte count in bone  
 
marrow transplantation therapy and the treatment of osteomyelodysplasia. 
This kind of drugs can also be used in the fields of thrombocytopenia following 
bone marrow transplantation and autoimmune diseases associated with 
platelet reduction, such as aplastic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic 
purpura. With this situation in mind, the present inventors designed and 
synthesized various compounds and investigated their leukocyte and platelet 
reduction recovering activity. As a result, the inventors found that a 
thioglycerol derivative promotes bone marrow cell growth to increase the 
peripheral leukocyte count and hence enhance immunity in mice, and that 
mouse
