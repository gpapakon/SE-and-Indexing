<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dye-donor elements for use in 
thermal dye sublimation transfer methods and to dyes for use in said 
dye-donor elements. Thermal dye sublimation transfer also called thermal dye 
diffusion transfer is a recording method in which a dye-donor 
element provided with a dye layer containing sublimable dyes having 
heat transferability is brought into contact with a receiver sheet 
and selectively, in accordance with a pattern information signal, is 
heated by means of a thermal printing head provided with a plurality 
of juxtaposed heat-generating resistors, so that dye is transferred 
from the selectively heated regions of the dye-donor element to the 
receiver sheet and forms a pattern thereon, the shape and density of 
which is in accordance with the pattern and intensity of heat 
applied to the dye-donor element. A dye-donor element for use according to thermal dye sublimation 
transfer usually comprises a very thin support e.g. a polyester 
support, one side of which has been covered with a dye layer 
comprising the printing dyes. Usually, an adhesive or subbing layer 
is provided between the support and the dye layer. Normally, the 
opposite side of the support is covered with a slipping layer that 
provides a lubricated surface against which the thermal printing 
head can pass without suffering abrasion. An adhesive layer may be 
provided between the support and the slipping layer. A dye-image receiving element for use according to thermal dye 
sublimation transfer usually comprises a support, e.g. paper or a 
transparant film coated with a dye-image receiving layer, into which 
the dye can diffuse more readily. An adhesive layer may be provided 
between the support and the receiving layer. A releasing agent may 
be contained in the receiving layer or in a separate layer on top of 
said receiving layer to improve the releasability of the receiving 
element from the donor element after the dye transfer has been 
effected. The dye layer can be a monochromic dye layer or it may comprise  
 
sequential repeating areas of differently coloured dyes e.g. dyes 
having a cyan, magenta, yellow, and optionally black-colour hue. 
When a dye-donor element containing three or more primary colour dye 
areas is used, a multicolour image can be obtained by sequentially 
performing the dye transfer process steps for each colour area. Black-coloured images can be obtained by thermal dye sublimation 
transfer printing either by sequentially performing the dye transfer 
process steps for
