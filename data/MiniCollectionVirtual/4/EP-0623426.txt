<ABSTRACT>
An automatic screw feed-in apparatus comprises a body 
constituted by a frame with a cover secured thereon, inside 

which a substantially circular interior space is formed to 
receive a pair of feeding wheels rotatable about a central 

axis thereof, which feeding wheels are in detent engagement 
with a driving wheel which is rotatable about the central 

axis with a follower pin extending therefrom through an 
arcuated slot formed on the cover, concentric with the 

central axis. An inlet and an outlet are provided on the 
body with a channel connecting therebetween to conduct an 

elongated strip having screws equally spaced thereon into 
the interior space of the body by the driving engagement 

thereof with the feeding wheels so as to move the screws to 
a ready-to-be-tightened position. A casing which houses the 

body in a biasing and movable manner relative to the body 
has a slot comprising an inclined section to partially 

receive the follower pin therein so that when the casing is 
moved toward the body, the driving wheel is caused to move 

the follower pin from the lower dead point to the upper dead 
point while the feeding wheels remain un-moved and when the 

casing is released, the follower pin moves from the upper 
dead point to the lower dead point to drive the driving 

wheel which in turn moves the feeding wheels by the detent 
engagement therebetween to advance the screw strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a screw feed-in device 
and in particular to an automatic screw feed-in apparatus 
which is capable to continuously bring screws disposed along 
an elongated flexible strip to a specified position for 
tightening after each tightening operation. The state-of-art screw feed-in devices currently 
available in the market generally comprise a handle and 
driving head. Within the driving head, a guiding channel is 
provided for escorting the strip on which the screws are 
equally spaced. Above the guiding channel, a toothed wheel 
is mounted in such a manner that when the toothed wheel is 
rotated an angle equal to the pitch thereof, the screw strip 
will advance a distance equal the spacing between two 
adjacent screws. According to the conventional screw feed-in devices, 
the feed-in toothed wheel is controlled by a post which is 
received within an arcuated slot and in mechanical 
engagement with the handle so that when the handle is 
lowered down, a clutch member mounted on the post engages 
the counterpart member secured to the toothed wheel and thus 
causing an angular movement of the toothed wheel as the post  
 
is moved within the arcuated slot. In this way, the screw 
strip is advanced when the handle is operated. Theoretically, each lowering-down of the handle will 
advance the screw strip a distance exactly equal to the 
spacing between two adjacent screws on the strip and one of 
the screws should be exactly placed at a location where a 
screw driver can reach to carry out the screw tightening 
operation. One of the disadvantages of the conventional screw 
feed-in apparatus is the complexity in structure of the 
clutch members used to mechanically connect the post and the 
toothed wheel. This not only increases the manufacturing 
cost of the screw feed-in device, but also requires a more 
sophisticated technique in manufacturing. Further, in the conventional screw feed-in device, the 
advance of the screw strip is done by the lowering-down of 
the handle. Once the handle is not lowered a suitable 
distance, the strip will not be moved to exactly have the 
next screw be placed at the position where the screw driver 
can normally reach and this results in a difficult situation 
for the screw driver to correctly engage and tighten the 
screw. Usually, a manual correction is required to move the 
screw to be in alignment with the screw driver. It is therefore desirable to provide an automatic screw 
feed-in apparatus which comprises an automatic screw 
advancing

<CLAIMS>
A screw feed-in apparatus for automatically advance 
screws disposed along an elongated strip toward a pre-determined 

ready-to-be-tightened position to be 
tightened by a tool, said apparatus comprising: 

   a body having a frame with a cover secured thereon 
to define therein a circular interior space which has a 

central axis extending from said frame to said cover, 
an inlet being formed on a lateral side of said body 

and an outlet on an opposite lateral side with a 
channel large enough for the screw strip to pass 

connecting therebetween and partially extending through 
a lower portion of said circular interior space, said 

body further having a slit formed at a portion lower 
than said channel and extending from a portion of said 

circular interior space to a bottom surface of said 
body to define a passage for the screws to pass; 

   screw feeding means which is disposed within said 
circular interior space to be drivingly engageable with 

the screw strip so as to advance the strip in a forward 
direction along said channel, from said inlet to said 

outlet; 
   driving means which is in detent engagement with 

said feeding means so that when said driving means is 
forced to move from a first position to a second 

position, said feeding means remains un-moved and when 
 

said driving means moves from the second position to 
the first position, said feeding is actuated to make a 

precise movement to exactly advance one of the screws 
disposed along the screw strip to the ready-to-be-tightened 

position; 
   paw means which is in engagement with said feeding 

means to prevent said feeding means to move in a 
direction opposite to advancing the screw strip in the 

forward direction; and 
   actuation means which is in mechanical engagement 

with said driving means so that when said actuation 
means is moved from a rest position to a work position, 

said driving means is caused to move from the first 
position to the second position to allow the screw 

located on the ready-to-be-tightened position to be 
engaged and tightened by the tool, and when the said 

actuation means is moved from the work position to the 
rest position, said driving means is released to move 

from the second position back to the first position to 
allow said feeding means to make a precise advance of 

the screw strip in order to bring the screw next to the 
just-tightened one to the ready-to-be-tightened 

position. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said 
feeding means comprises a pair of feeding wheels 

mounted, in an axially-spaced manner, on a shaft which 
 

extends along and is rotatable about the central axis 
of said circular interior space, each of said feeding 

wheels having a periphery on which a plurality of teeth 
formed in an angularly equally-spaced manner to engage 

with two opposite equally-spacedly notched longitudinal 
sides of the strip so as to advance the strip in the 

forward direction as the feeding wheels are rotated in 
a first direction. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said paw 
means comprises a paw member pivotally mounted inside 

said body and having one end thereof spring-biased to 
have an opposite end thereof in contacting engagement 

with the teeth of said feeding wheels so that said 
feeding wheel is allowed to rotate in the first 

direction thereof only and, due to the contacting 
engagement of said feeding wheels with said paw member, 

rotation of said feeding wheels in a direction opposite 
to the first direction thereof is prohibited. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said 
driving means comprises a driving wheel rotatably 

mounted on said shaft and having a plurality of detents 
formed on one surface thereof facing said feeding 

wheels, each of said detents comprising an elongated 
member mounted on said surface of the driving wheel, 

extending along a radius of said driving wheel and 
 

having a substantially right-triangular cross section 
to be respectively received within a plurality of 

radially extending, right-triangular cross-sectional 
slots formed on a surface of one of the feeding wheels 

facing the driving wheel to form the detent engagement 
between said feeding wheels 
and said driving wheel, 
said right-triangular cross sections of the detents of 

the driving wheel and the slots of the feeding wheels 
comprising an inclined camming surface so that when 

said driving wheel is rotated from the first position 
thereof to the second position thereof, the camming 

surface of each of the detents received within the 
slots of the feeding wheels slides along the camming 

surfaces of the slots and thus moving out thereof to 
have the feeding wheels disengage from the driving 

wheel so as to maintain un-moved and when the driving 
wheel is rotated from the second position to the first 

position, said detents abuttingly engage said slots so 
as to have the feeding wheels to rotate in unison with 

said driving wheel. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, wherein said 
actuation means comprises a first casing housing said 

body in such a manner to have a top wall thereof 
opposing a top surface of said body with a first 

resilient means disposed therebetween to bias said top 
wall to a remote position relative to the top surface 

 
of said body, which is the rest position of the 

actuation means, and to allow said first casing to be 
movable against said resilient means toward a close 

position relative to said body, which is the work 
position of the actuation means, and wherein said 

driving wheel comprises a follower pin extending from a 
surface opposite to the surface thereof on which said 

detents are formed, through an arcuated slot formed on 
said cover in concentricity with said central axis, 

said follower pin further extending into a driving slot 
formed on a side surface of said first casing, said 

driving slot comprising a vertical section and an 
inclined section with said follower pin received within 

said inclined section so that when said first casing is 
moved from the remote position to said close position, 

said follower pin is caused, under the action of both 
said arcuated slot of the cover and the inclined 

section of the driving slot of said first casing to 
move from a first point to a second point and rotate 

the driving wheel from the first position to the second 
position thereof as the feeding wheels remain un-moved, 

and when said first casing is released to move from the 
close position back to the remote position, said 

follower pin moves from the second point to the first 
point to rotate the driving wheel from the second 

position to the first position with the feeding wheels 
rotate in unison therewith due to the detent engagement 

 
therebetween to advance the strip along the forward 

direction. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein said body 
comprises a tool hole extending from the top surface 

thereof to the bottom surface thereof to allow the tool 
to insert therein to engage the screw located at the
