<ABSTRACT>
In a hand-actuated fork-lift truck, in which the load forks are pumped upwards via pumping movements of a pole by means of a lifting cylinder and a lifting piston, provision is made according to the invention in order to simplify the pumping-up for an energy accumulator in the form of a bubble accumulator (35) to be attached via a valve-controlled non-return bypass line (33) for receiving the hydraulic oil during lowering of the lifting part (10) under load.
