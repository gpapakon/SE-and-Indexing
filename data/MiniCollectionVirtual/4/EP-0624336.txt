<ABSTRACT>
A multi-piece shower curtain ring comprising an elongated tube (12) 
having a first end and a second end, an interconnecting plug for 

interconnecting the first end of the elongated tube to the second 
end of the elongated tube to form an essentially circular shower 

curtain ring for supporting a shower curtain (19), thus facilitating the 
hanging or removal of a shower curtain (19) from a curtain rod (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to shower curtain 
rings for hanging a shower curtain and, in particular, to a novel 
shower curtain ring construction which facilitates the hanging and 
replacement of a shower curtain. Generally, shower curtain rings have been used to hang 
shower curtains on a curtain rod to prevent water from leaving a 
shower or bath enclosure. Heretofore, shower curtain rings have 
been primarily of two closed designs. The first type of closed 
design is a one-piece metal hook which only permits the 
displacement of the hook onto or away from a shower curtain and 
curtain rod by exerting considerable pressure on two ends of the 
metal hook. A second type of closed ring is an injection molded 
one-piece plastic ring having an interlocking construction 
comprised of an elongated bayonet projection that is received into 
an opening formed in the opposing portion of the ring. Both of 
these types of shower curtain rings are less than completely 
satisfactory because they are often difficult to engage and 
disengage from the shower curtain and the curtain rod. Also, 
molded plastic rings are easily broken due to the force needed to 
open the rings sufficiently for replacement and removal. 
Accordingly, an improved shower curtain ring having a construction 
which facilitates replacement and removal of a shower curtain is 
desired. Generally speaking, in accordance with the present 
invention, an improved shower curtain ring is provided including 
elongated tubing having a first end and a second end, the tubing 
having a substantially circular cross-section. A first connector 
is secured within the first end of the elongated tubing and a 
second connector is secured within the second end of the elongated 
tubing. The first connector and the second connector are 
constructed and arranged to be releasably interconnected to each 
other to form with the tubing an essentially circular shower 
curtain ring for supporting a shower curtain and for facilitating 
the hanging or removal of a shower curtain from a curtain rod. 
another embodiment, in accordance with the present invention, an 
elongated tube is provided with a one-piece connector. The  
 
connector is adapted to be releasably inserted into both ends of 
the tubing to form a shower curtain ring for supporting the shower 
curtain and for facilitating the hanging and removal of a shower 
curtain. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved closed loop type shower curtain ring for 
facilitating the
