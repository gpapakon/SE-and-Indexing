<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for the stabilization or purification of perfluoroalkanes, which, due to the preparation process, still contain polyfluoroalkanes. The stabilization or purification is effected by reacting the polyfluoroalkanes with fluorine under elevated pressure at elevated temperature. The process is particularly suitable for purifying perfluoroalkanes starting from mixtures containing perfluoroalkanes and polyfluoroalkanes. This gives perfluoroalkanes which are essentially free from polyfluoroalkanes. The advantage of the process is the fact that perfluorination is rapid and yet without an appreciable formation of by-products or degradation products.

A method for the preparation of perfluoroalkanes 
which are substantially free of polyfluoroalkanes, by 

reacting mixtures which contain perfluoroalkanes and 
polyfluoroalkanes with a reactive gas selected from the 

group comprising elemental fluorine and a fluorine/inert 
gas mixture, characterised in that a reactive gas 

having a content of 40 to 100% by volume fluorine and 0 
to 60% by volume inert gas is used and the reaction is 

performed at a pressure of 4 to 12 bar (abs.) and a 
temperature of 75 - 120°C. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that mixtures are used which contain at most 0.5 mole 

percent polyfluoroalkanes. 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that one operates in the presence of a 

quantity of KF or NaF sufficient for absorbing HF. 
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the reaction is performed with a 

reactive gas consisting of 40 to 60% by volume fluorine 
and 60 to 40% by volume inert gas and at a pressure of 

5 to 10 bar (abs.) and a temperature of 80 to 120°C. 
A method according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the reaction is performed at a temperature of 80 

to 100°C. 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the method is used for the 

preparation of linear or branched, aliphatic perfluoroalkanes 
having 5 to 7 C atoms.  

 
A method according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the reaction is performed over a 

period of 5 to 10 hours.
