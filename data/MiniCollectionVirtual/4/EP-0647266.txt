<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to proteins
incorporating D-amino acid residues. More
particularly, the present invention relates to
enzymically active proteins consisting essential of
D-amino acids and methods for using such proteins.The biosphere is inherently chiral; each class
of biological macromolecules is made up of monomer
molecules of uniform chirality (Mason, Chirality
3:223, 1991) and the biochemical interactions of
biological macromolecules are inherently chiral.Enzymes, for example, invariably act only on one
enantiomer of a chiral substrate, or generate only
one diastereomer from a prochiral substrate. Fersht,
in "Enzyme Structure and Mechanism", W.H. Freeman and
Company, San Francisco, 1977, pp. 75-81. This
specificity can be related to the chiral structure of
the enzyme molecule, including the three-dimensional
folding of the polypeptide backbone and the
orientation of the amino acid side chains in the
folded protein molecule. Fersht, supra. To date
only L-enzymes have been described in nature; this
leaves the description of D-enzymes and their
properties, which include folded structure, enzymatic
activity, and chiral specificity, as unexplored
questions.Recently, Zawadzke et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
114:4002-4003, 1992, described the preparation of a
small 45 amino acid residue polypeptide (D-rubrodoxin)
using D-amino acids. L-rubrodoxin is
found in clostridia and is the simplest iron-sulfur
protein. It is believed to function in electron 
transport. However, it lacks a demonstrated enzymic activity.Prior to the present invention, the largest L-protein known to be chemically synthesized
in a conventional step-wise fashion is Preprogonadotropin Release Hormone (PreproGnRH).
PreproGnRH has 93 amino acid residues. (Milton et al., Biochemistry, (1992) 31: 8800.)
PreproGnRH inhibits prolactin release.An article in Science (vol 256, 5 June 1992, 1445) discloses D- and L-forms of HIV-1
protease enzyme.An article in Science (vol 256, 10 April 1992, 221) discloses a method of ligating end-to-end
two oligopeptides having a composition of amino acids for obtaining a synthetic L-enzyme.
The article also includes a conjecture to incorporate D-amino acid residues to stereochemicallj<
engineer the enzyme.Many organic compounds exist in optically, active forms. i.e.. they have the ability to
rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes
D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral
center(s). The
