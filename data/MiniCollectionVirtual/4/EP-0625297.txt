<CLAIMS>
Method for decoding letterbox signals, in the
case of which method the first line (23) of the first

field and the last line (623) of the second field are
set to a fixed value, in particular black, before the

letterbox format conversion at the transmission end of
the lines containing the video content and, after the

format conversion, the helper lines (23-58) of the
first field are shifted by one line in the direction of

higher line numbers, and the helper lines (588-623) of
the second field are shifted by one line in the

direction of lower line numbers, the last transmitted
or recorded helper line being used for the

reconstruction (45) at the receiver end of the original
lines (23-623) in each case instead of the missing

first letterbox line (59) of the first field, and the
first transmitted or recorded helper line (587) being

used instead of the missing last letterbox line (587)
of the second field.
Circuit for a method according to Claim 1,
provided with storage means for helper signals (42) and

storage means (43) for letterbox signals, to which the
corresponding lines are in each case supplied

controlled by a reading-in and reading-out controller
(44), and from which the corresponding lines are read

out into a downstream recontruction matrix (45) in
order to form the original line number at the

transmitter end, the reading in and reading out in each
case being carried out continually for the helper lines 

and for the letterbox lines, in that the helper line
which is arranged at this point in time is in each case

read in for the missing letterbox line.
