<ABSTRACT>
Sealing strip, especially for building woodwork, possessing a heel piece (21) for mounting in a groove or channel (G) of a sectional profile (m) of the said woodwork. It comprises a profiled sealing part (22) proper made of a flexible material, which is sufficiently "compressible" in order, on the one hand, to be able to be locally deformed to a significant extent without losing its sealing properties and, on the other hand, to fulfil the various sealing functions for which it is employed.
