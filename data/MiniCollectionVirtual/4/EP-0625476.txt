<ABSTRACT>
A cutting roller (31) having cutting blades (33) 
and a receiving roller (32) are provided downstream of 

pulling-out rollers (21) for pulling out a web (2), and 
the web passing between them is cut. Accelerating 

rollers (51) rotated at a transmitting speed higher than 
that of the pulling-out rollers (21) apply a tension to 

the web. The cutting blades (33) are formed with narrow 
cutouts (35), and the receiving roller (32) is provided 

with narrow annular grooves (37). Stretched tension 
guide members (12) extend through the notches (35) and 

the narrow annular grooves (37) so as to guide the web. 

The portions of the web corresponding to the notches 
(35) and the narrow annular grooves (37) are not cut by 

the cutting blades (33) and are left as uncut portions. 
However, these portions are broken easily by the tension 

applied to the web (2). Since the widths of the cutouts 
(35) and the annular grooves (37) are very narrow, the 

torn marks on the broken portions of the web are not 
remarkable. As the tension guide members (12) extend 

continuously, the cut end of the web is not caught and 
are not rolled on the cutting roller (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for pulling out 
a web from web roll, cutting said web at a predetermined 
length and supplying the cutted web piece according to the 
preamble of claim 1 and as already known from GB-A-M 23 859. In particular, the invention is provided for a continuously 
supplied web-like packing material in a packing process at a 
predetermined length and supplying the same to a packing 
machine. In general, a packing material used for packing 
cigarettes has an elongated web-like shape and is wound 
into a web roll. In the cigarette packing process, the 
web is continuously pulled out and cut at a length 
corresponding to the length of a pack, and the cut web 
piece is supplied to a packing apparatus or the like in 
the next process. One of the conventional apparatuses for cutting a 
web-like material at a predetermined length and 
supplying the same to the apparatus in the next process 
cuts off web pieces from the web at the predetermined 
to-be-cut portions at predetermined intervals. The web 
on this apparatus has cutouts extending crosswise of the 
web. Each cutout comprises alternating discontinuous 
broken line portions and unbroken portions which connect 
adjacent web portions together so that the web can be 
continuously pulled out although it has the cutouts. 
After having pulled out, each web portion is moved between 
two pairs of rollers arranged in tandem in its  
 
moving direction. The transporting speeds of the paired 
rollers differ from each other. The downstream side 
pair of rollers rotate at a higher speed than the 
upstream side pair rollers. Thus, each web portion is 
applied with a predetermined tension while it moves between 
these pairs of rollers. The unbroken portions of 
the cutout are cut off by the tension and the web is cut 
at the predetermined length at the portion to be cut. 
The cut-out web portion is supplied to the packing 
apparatus or the like. Although this conventional cutting and supplying 
apparatus has a simple structure, it has the following 
disadvantage. When a web is made of cellophane or the 
like, the web is torn away substantially linearly at the 
unbroken portions at the cutouts and the cut-out portions 
are smooth. When, however, a web is made of paper 
or the like, the unbroken portions at the cutouts are 
not cut linearly but torn irregularly and/or become 
fluffy. The irregular and/or fluffy cut edges sometimes 
cause poor operation such as clogging of the web portion 
in the next process and deteriorates the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for pulling out a web (2) from a web roll 
(1), cutting said web (2) at a predetermined length and 

supplying the cutted web portion, said apparatus 
comprising: 


(a) pulling-out means (3) comprising at least one pair 
of pulling-out rollers (21) rotated in opposite 

directions at predetermined transmitting speed, for 
holding therebetween a web portion pulled out from a 

web roll (1) and transporting said web portion in a 
transporting direction; 
(b) cutting means (4) comprising:
 
a cutting roller (31) and a receiving roller (32) 

disposed close to each other, as a pair, downstream 
of said pulling-out roller (21), said cutting roller 

(31) having a peripheral surface and said receiving 
roller having a peripheral surface;and at least one 

axially extending cutting blades (33) provided on 

said peripheral surface of said cutting roller (31), 
for pressing said peripheral surface of said 

receiving roller (32) and cutting said web portion 
passing between said cutting roller (31) and said 

receiving roller (32) at a predetermined length into 
a web piece having two surfaces; and 
(c) accelerating means (5)
 
characterised in that
 
said acceleration means (5) comprise, for 

sandwiching and transporting said web piece in said 
transporting direction, at least one pair of 

accelerating rollers (51) provided downstream of 
said cutting means (4) and rotated at a transporting 

speed higher than said transporting speed of said 
pulling-out rollers (21);
  
 

and that there are further provided: 
(d) guide means (6) comprising a plurality of tension 
guide members (12)having a small diameter and

predetermined tension from an upstream side to a 

downstream side of said guide means along said both 
surfaces of said web piece which has passed through 

said pulling-out means (3), said cutting means (4) 
and said accelerating means (5) for guiding said web 

piece in a state in which said tension guide 
members (12) contact with said both surfaces of said 

web piece;
