<ABSTRACT>
The method described uses a coordinate-measuring instrument that includes a video camera (6) and a mechanical probe unit (7) with a feeler (8) designed to measure the position of the workpiece surface by contacting the surface, the points on the workpiece (9) which are to be sensed by the feeler being approached under visual control using a monitor (10) linked to the video camera. For this purpose, the feeler (8) is located in the field of view of the video camera (6).

Method of making coordinate measurements on workpieces 
with a coordinate measuring apparatus (1-4) which carries 

a video camera (6, 26, 36, 56, 66, 76) and a mechanical 
probe head (7, 47, 57, 77) having a probe element (8, 28, 

48, 58, 78) for contact measuring the workpiece surface 
with the video camera and the mechanical probe head are so 

aligned to each other that the probe element is located in 
the viewing field (17, 27, 37, 87) of the video camera and 

with the locations on the workpiece which are to be 
mechanically contacted with the probe element being driven 

to under simultaneous visual control with the aid of a 
monitor (10) connected to the video camera. 
Coordinate measuring apparatus having 

a video camera (6, 26, 36, 56, 66) which is connected 
to a monitor (10); 
a mechanical probe head (7, 47, 57, 77) movable in at 
least two spatial directions, the probe head carrying 

a probe element (8); 
a computer (12) as well as a control unit (11) 
connected thereto by which the movements of the probe 

head are controlled and the measurement signals 
emitted by the probe head are further processed; 
wherein the video camera and the mechanical probe 
head are so aligned to each other that the probe 

element is located in the viewing field (17, 27, 37, 
87) of the video camera, so that the locations on the 

workpiece, which are to be mechanically contacted 
with to probe element can be driven to under 

simultaneous visual control with the aid of the 
monitor (10). 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of claim 2, wherein the 
probe element (8) is attached to the probe head (7) via an 

extension (20) or an angle piece or the like.  
 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of claim 2, wherein the 
probe element (40) is rotatable or pivotable. 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of claim 2, wherein the 
video camera (26) is rotatable or pivotable. 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of claim 2, wherein an 
element (31) is provided which deflects the beam path of 

the video camera (36) in the direction toward the probe 
element (28). 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of claim 2, wherein the 
video camera (6) and mechanical probe head (7) are 

attached to a common carrier (5) and the probe element (8) 
of the mechanical probe head is attached via an electromechanical 

probe-changing unit (19) to the movable part 
(7a) of the probe head. 
Coordinate measuring apparatus according to one of the 
claims 2 to 7, wherein the mechanical probe head is a 

miniature probe head in the form of a quartz oscillator 
probe (57, 77). 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of one of the claims 2 to 
8, having a illuminating unit (25) which makes the probe 

element (28) visible and excites scattered radiation. 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of one of the claims 2 to 
9, wherein the video camera (76) includes two optics (73a, 

73b) which are suitable for receiving stereo images and 
the probe element (78) is located in the portion (80) of 

the viewing field (87a, 87b) common to both optics. 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of one of the claims 2 to 
10, wherein the optical axis of the video camera (26, 36) 

is inclined with respect to at least one of the machine 
axes of the coordinate measuring apparatus and the control  

 
of the coordinate measuring apparatus moves the mechanical 

probe head simultaneously in at least two coordinate 
directions corresponding to the inclination angle between 

the optical axis of the video camera and the particular 
machine axis (z). 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of one of the claims 2 to 
11, wherein an illuminating unit having several light 

sources is assigned to the video camera and the light 
sources radiate in various directions; and, the light 

sources can be so controlled individually or in groups 
that the intensity or direction of the illuminating light 

is adjustable. 
Coordinate measuring apparatus of claim 2, wherein the 
video camera (56, 76) and the mechanical probe head (57, 

77) or the probe element of the probe head are attached 
together to the same probe-changing unit (49, 79).
