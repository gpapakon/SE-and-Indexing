<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a safety device making it possible, in the event of an accident, to open or to close a valve (2) with a rotary shut-off member normally actuated by a motor (4). The device according to the invention consists of a linkage system (6) interposed between the shaft (1) for controlling the valve and the rotary drive shaft (3). This system (6) has a hollow enclosure (7) equipped with two pipes (15, 16) and containing a moving part (18) which can move between an initial position in which it is secured to the two shafts (1, 3) and a final position in which it is still secured only to the drive shaft (3) and in which it frees a communication passage between the two pipes (15, 16). The pipe (15) is connected to a source of pressurised gas and the pipe (16) is connected to a piston (27) able to actuate the shaft (1) for operating the valve. The device according to the invention makes it possible, in normal time, to retain the use of the motor (4).

A device for operating a valve (2) with rotary sealing
member having a control stem (1) actuated by a rotary drive

stem (3) disposed as a continuation of said control stem
(1) and connected firmly therewith by a connection system

(6), characterised in that:

1) said connection system (6) comprises a hollow
chamber (7) independent of one at least of said stems

(1, 3), said chamber being provided with two lines
(15, 16) and containing a mobile member (18) capable

of moving between, on the one hand, an initial
position in which it is integral both with said

control stem (1) and said drive stem (3) and where it
constitutes a tight barrier between the two lines (15,

16) and, on the other hand, an end position in which
said mobile member (18) remains integral with at most

only one of the stems (1, 3) and where it opens a
communication between the two lines (15, 16),
2) a fluid source (24) is connected to one of said
lines (15),
3) the other line (16) is connected to a piston (27)
capable of actuating the control stem (1) of said

valve (2).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
movement of said mobile member (18) is obtained by a

pyrotechnic cartridge, or a pyrotechnic retractor.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
line (15) connected to the fluid source (24) is arranged in

such a way that the movement of said mobile member (18) is
obtained by said fluid. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that
said fluid is a pressurised gas.
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that
said gas source (24) is a tank equipped with a cock (28).
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that
said gas source (24) is a pyrotechnic gas generator

equipped with a trigger.
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that
said chamber (7) is fixed to the control stem (1) of the

valve (2) and in that said piston (27) acts on the control
stem (1) of the valve (2) through the intermediary of a

rack (30) which meshes with a toothed segment (31) carried
by said hollow chamber (7).
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that
said hollow chamber (7) comprises a blind cylindrical

receptacle (9) and ends in non-abutting circular ring
elements (10).
A device according to claim 8, characterised in that
said drive stem (3) ends in a blind cylindrical receptacle

(12) and non-abutting circular ring elements (14) extending
the elements (10) carried by said chamber (7).
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that
said mobile member (18) comprises a lower cylindrical

portion (19) capable of sliding in the blind receptacle (9)
carried by said chamber (7), a median portion consisting of

arms (21) capable of fitting between the circular ring
elements (10) carried by said chamber (7) and the circular

ring elements (14) carried by the drive stem (3), and an
upper cylindrical portion (22) capable of sliding in the

blind receptacle (12) carried by the drive stem (3).
