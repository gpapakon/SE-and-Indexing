<ABSTRACT>
The stator consists of a plurality of stacked laminations, 
each having a plurality of radiating teeth (4). The teeth 

have opposite peripheral end tongues (7, 8) separated so as 
to form slots (9, 10) wherein coils (15, 16) are 

alternately arranged in two rows. Each tooth (4) has 
opposite side walls (5, 6) with portions (13, 14) on which 

the coils (15, 16) are wound. Said portions (13, 14) are 
radially separated and disposed at an angle so that the 

straight lines passing by each radially outer pair of 
portions (14) on which the coils (16) are wound on a first 

row define a centripetal angle (a1) equal to a centrifugal 
angle (a3), which is defined by the straight lines passing 

by each pair of radially inner portions (13) on which the 
coils (15) of the other row are wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a stator for two-phase 
electric machines. The arrangement of the stator is 
optimised to determine impedance of the phases, and obtain 
minimum thickness of the winding teeth, thermal and 
electric insulation between the coils and the maximum 
surface of copper exposed for cooling. This arrangement of the stator is particularly 
advantageous for two-phase electric machines having a flat 
structure, i. e. a structure providing for each coil a 
length of wire on the teeth greater or of the same order of 
length compared to the wire in the slot. At present, there are diffused two arrangements for 
two-phase stators. The first of the two arrangements, is shown in FIGS. 1 
and 1A, where coils are characterized by L1 = L2 and a 
closing of the magnetic fluxes very similar for the two 
phases (Φd1 = Φd2). This arrangement causes the coils to 
be partially superimposed on the stator teeth and causes an 
increase in the length of the average turn of the outer 
coils (L4 > L3). This increases both costs and electric 
resistance. Also, this kind of arrangement results in 
increased axial bulk, reduction of coil surfaces exposed 
for cooling, and physical contact between coils of 
different phases, so that electric insulation is left to 
the copper wire enamel.  
 The second arrangement that is currently used, as 
shown in FIGS. 2, 2A and 2B, tends to increase the coil 
surface which remains exposed to the air. In this 
arrangement, the coils are separated by being wound 
alternately on the inner and outer part of the stator 
teeth, in order to provide constant axial bulk for each 
coil (L3 = L4). However, this kind of structure, besides resolving all 
of the inconveniences cited for the first one, for obvious 
geometric reasons provides substantial difference between 
the length of the inner and outer coils (L2 > L1). In 
addition, the dispersed magnetic fluxes have a different 
closing (Φd2 < Φd1). The combination of these two factors leads to a lack 
of balance between the time constant (L/R) of the inner 
coils with respect to the outer coils. The inner coils will 
exhibit a higher L (greater dispersed flux) and a lower R 
(shorter average turn); as a consequence, efficiency of the 
machine is worsened. Moreover, physical separation of the outer coils 
requires particular devices in the winding machine. As a 
matter of fact, owing to the cone shape of the walls of the 
slots, as the outer coils are wound, the taut wire tends to 
slide inwardly and rest on the inner coils,

A stator for two-phase electric machines, consisting 
of a plurality of stacked laminations made of 

ferromagnetic discs and closed frontally by two 
terminal boards (20) of insulating material; a 

plurality of radiating teeth (4) being obtained in 
said stack of laminations and terminal boards, said 

teeth having opposite peripheral end tongues (7, 8) 
separated (11) so as to form a plurality of slots (9, 

10) equally spaced radially between side walls (5, 6) 
of the plurality of adjacent teeth (4); said slots (9, 

10) being crossed by the wire being wound on the side 
walls (5, 6) of each pair of adjacent teeth (4) to 

form coils (15, 16) alternately arranged in two rows, 
characterized in that each tooth (4) has portions (13, 

14) of the opposite side walls (5, 6) on which the 
coils (15, 16) are wound, said portions (13, 14) being 

radially separated and disposed at an angle so that 
the straight lines passing by each radially outer pair 

of portions (14) on which the coils (16) are wound on 
a first row define a centripetal angle (a1) equal to a 

centrifugal angle (a3), which is defined by the 
straight lines passing by each pair of radially inner 

portions (13) on which the coils (15) of the other row 
are wound, whereby coils (15, 16) disposed on two 

circumferentially separated rows are defined. 
A stator according to claim 1, characterized in that  
 

the distance (L2) between the radially outer portions 
(14) on which each coil (16) of the first row is wound 

is equal to the distance (L1) between the radially 
inner portions (13) on which each coil (15) of the 

second row is wound, so that the coils (15, 16) of the 
two rows have equal length. 
A stator according to claim 1, characterized in that 
separators (21) are provided on the teeth of the 

terminal boards (20), said separators being disposed 
though the teeth so as to separate said portions (13, 

14) and the coils (15, 16) wound thereon. 
A stator according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the ends of the opposite tongues (7, 8) of the teeth 

(4) have different contours, so as to equalise the 
closing of dispersed magnetic fluxes (Φd1, Φd2). 
A stator according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the plurality of laminations is locked by riveting 

(22) or caulking or another known mechanical system 
causing electric contact between the laminations on 

the teeth (4); rivets being disposed at an angle being 
360° divided the number of pole pairs of the machine, 

or at an angle equal to that existing between two 
magnetic sectors generating the magnetic field and 

having the same polarity, so as to cut down power loss 
due to parasitic currents generated within the 

lamination stack.
