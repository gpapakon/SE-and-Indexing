<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a D-α-amino acid represented by general formula (I), (wherein R represents phenyl, hydroxylated 
phenyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, or thienyl) by treating as N-carbamyl-D-α-amino acid represented by general formula 

(II), (wherein R is as defined above) in an aqueous medium with an enzyme produced by a microorganism, wherein use is made 
of a decarbamylase which can be produced by a microorganism belonging to the genus 
Comamonas
, 
Blastobacter
, 
Alkaligenes
, 

Sporosarcina
, 
Rhizobium
, 
Bradyrhizobium
, or

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a D-α-amino acid, in which a D-N-carbamyl-α-amino
acid corresponding to the general formula:

wherein R represents phenyl, hydroxy-substituted phenyl,
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl preferably having 1 to 5
carbon atoms, or thienyl,
is converted by an enzyme having an ability to eliminate the
carbamyl group (hereinafter referred to as "decarbamylase")
to a D-α-amino acid corresponding to the formula:

wherein R is the same as defined above.These optically active D-α-amino acids are
important as pharmaceutical intermediates. In particular,
D-phenylglycine and D-(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycine (hereinafter
referred to as "D-HPG") are useful for the production of
semi-synthetic penicillin and semi-synthetic cephalosporin.Production of D-α-amino acids by eliminating
carbamyl groups from corresponding D-N-carbamyl-α-amino
acids has been known. The elimination has been done
chemically (Japanese Patent Publication No. 4707/1983) or by
enzymatic reactions of microorganisms (Japanese Patent
Publication Nos. 18793/1982, 20520/1988 and 48758/1989).Document JP-B-57-18793 describes a process for the production of D-α-amino acids
using microorganisms. Said microorganisms have the capability of converting N-carbamoyl-α-amino
acids into D-α-amino acids and belong to the genus Pseudomonas,
Arthrobacter, Alicagenes, Achromobacter, Maraxella or Paracoccus.In document EP-A-0610517 a decarbamylase is described which is artificially produced by
genetic recombination techniques. The DNA disclosed codes for a decarbamylase
improved in thermostability. This improved thermostability is the result of a replacement
of at least one base of a DNA fragment coding for a decarbamylase protein originating in a
microbe with another base and the resultant replacement of at least one of the
corresponding amino acids. Agrobacterium radiobacter KNK712 has been used to
produce a derivative having two or three amino acid mutations in three amino acids which
have been found to have a relation to thermostability.In WO 92/10579 a gene is disclosed which pertains to D-N-carbamoyl-α-amino acid
amidohydrolase which converts D-N-carbamoyl-α-amino acid and to a D-α-amino acid. It
describes further a recombinant plasmid comprising said gene and a microorganism
belonging to the genus Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Bacillus, Serratia,
Corynebacterium or Brevibacterium transformed by integrating the recombinant plasmid
therein. Said microorganism may be used in a process for
