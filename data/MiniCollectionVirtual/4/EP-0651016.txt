<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyphenylene
ether thermoplastic resin composition which is excellent
in impact resistance, particularly surface impact
strength.Polyphenylene ether resin is one of the
engineering plastics having excellent properties such as
heat resistance and mechanical properties.Said polyphenylene ether resins have already
been disclosed in prior art references, for example, US-A-3,306,874;
US-A-3,306,875 and US-A-3,573,257.Polyphenylene ether resins have such disadvantages
that their moldability is poor and their impact
resistance is low though they have excellent properties
as mentioned above. In order to overcome such disadvantages,
various methods have been proposed. For making
moldability better, there is known a method comprising
blending with the polyphenylene ether resin a styrene
homopolymer which is compatible with the polyphenylene
ether resin, and for improving the impact resistance,
there is known a method comprising blending and dispersing
a rubber therein. In particular, the rubber-modified
styrene copolymers are effective in that
moldability and impact resistance can be simultaneously
improved. Particularly, polybutadiene rubber on which 
styrene has been graft-copolymerized (referred to
hereinafter as BR-HIPS) is generally used. For example,
US-A-3,383,435 discloses polyphenylene ether resin/BR-HIPS.In particular, in order to improve impact resistance,
for example, JP-B-47-32,731 discloses blending
a polybutadiene rubber with a polyphenylene ether resin.
This is also disclosed in JP-A-46-2,345, JP-A-48-74,552,
JP-A-49-85,144, US-A-3,835,200 and US-A-3,994,856.However, polybutadiene (referred to hereinafter
as BR) has unsaturations in the polymer main
chain, and hence, is instable against heat and light.
As a result, when a polybutadiene rubber is blended with
a polyphenylene ether resin, the heat stability, light
stability and weather resistance of the resulting resin
composition are unsatisfactory in practice.Moreover, US-A-3,361,851 and JP-B-42-7,069 propose
blending a polyolefin with a polyphenylene ether
resin to improve the moldability of the polyphenylene
ether resin and also improve the impact resistance of a
molded article obtained therefrom. Polyolefin is
superior to BR in heat stability and light stability.
However, polyolefin is essentially inferior in compatibility
with the polyphenylene ether resin, and hence,
for example, when at least 5% by weight of a polyolefin
is blended with the polyphenylene ether resin, phase
separation is clearly observed in the
