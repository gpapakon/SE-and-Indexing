<ABSTRACT>
A triple-head scintillation camera system is 
retrofitted so as to perform like a dual-head system of the 

type which is dedicated to cardiac SPECT applications. 
This is done by collimating two of the detectors of the 

system with collimators that so collimate the collimated 
directions of view of the detectors as to cause the 

collimated directions of view to subtend a right angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to scintillation camera systems, 
and more particularly relates to multi-detector 
scintillation camera systems. In its most immediate sense, 
the invention relates to triple-head scintillation camera 
systems which are used to perform SPECT cardiac studies. In a triple-detector (a so-called triple-head) 
scintillation camera system such as is marketed by Siemens 
Medical Systems, Inc. under the MULTISPECT 3 trademark, 
adjacent detectors have uncollimated directions of view 
which subtend an arc of 120 degrees. When such a camera is 
used to carry out a 180 degree cardiac SPECT study, the 
gantry must be rotated through 120 degrees to obtain 
sufficient data. Because of the geometry of the system and 
the anatomy of the patient, some of the data collected by 
one of the detectors and all of the data collected by 
another one of the detectors, is of little use. As a 
result, the performance of such a triple-head system in 
cardiac SPECT studies is only slightly better than the 
performance of a (much less expensive) single-head 
scintillation camera system. Dual-head scintillation camera systems have been 
designed for dedicated use in cardiac SPECT applications. 
In such dedicated dual-head systems, the detectors have 
uncollimated directions of view which subtend an arc of 90 
degrees. Such a system can acquire sufficient data for a 
cardiac SPECT study during a gantry rotation of only 90 
degrees, and each of the detectors collects useful data at 
all positions during the study. This makes it possible to  
 
conduct a cardiac SPECT study in less time and increases 
patient throughput. Only a few clinics can afford to have a special dual-head 
camera system whose utility is limited to cardiac 
SPECT applications. Furthermore, it is not presently 
feasible to retrofit or modify a triple-head scintillation 
camera system to orient the uncollimated directions of view 
of two of the detectors to subtend a right angle. 
Therefore, the great majority of nuclear medicine 
departments, and even departments which own conventional 
triple-head scintillation camera systems, are unable to 
obtain the advantages of dedicated dual-head scintillation 
camera systems when conducting cardiac SPECT studies. It would be advantageous to provide method and 
apparatus which would be suitable for retrofitting a multi-head 
SPECT scintillation camera system, and particularly a 
triple-head SPECT scintillation camera system, so as to 
make the retrofitted system perform like a dedicated dual-head 
cardiac
