<CLAIMS>
A fungicidal mixture containing 

a) the oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I 
 
and 


b) a morpholine or piperidine derivative II selected from 
the group of compounds IIa, IIb and IIc 
 
(n = 10,11,12 (60 - 70 %) or 13)
 
in a synergistically active amount. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and the morpholine derivative IIa. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and the piperidine derivative IIb. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and the morpholine derivative IIc. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
weight ratio of the compound I to the compound II is from 

20:1 to 0.1:2. 
A process for controlling harmful fungi, which comprises 
treating the harmful fungi, their environment or the plants, 

seeds, soils, surfaces, materials or spaces to be kept free 
from them with the compound of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and a compound of the formula II as claimed in 
claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the compound I as 
claimed in claim 1 and a compound II as claimed in claim 1 

are applied simultaneously jointly or separately, or in succession.  
 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the harmful fungi, 
their environment or the plants, seeds, soils, surfaces, materials 

or spaces to be kept free from them are treated with 
from 0.01 to 0.5 kg/ha of the compound I as claimed in 

claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the harmful fungi, 
their environment or the plants, seeds, soils, surfaces, materials 

or spaces to be kept free from them are treated with 
from 0.05 to 1 kg/ha of a compound II as claimed in claim 1. 
The use of the compound I as claimed in claim 1 for the production 
of fungicidally active synergistic mixtures as 

claimed in claim 1. 
The use of the compounds II as claimed in claim 1 for the 
production of fungicidally active synergistic mixtures as 

claimed in claim 1.
