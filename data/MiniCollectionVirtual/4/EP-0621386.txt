<ABSTRACT>
2.1 This method is intended to be such that the opening-out device can be used as mounting aid for the shank screws (9) of a retaining block (5), which shank screws, by means of their shanks (10), can be screwed or cut into the groove base of the associated fitting-reception groove of the sash/leaf frame. 2.2 Before the introduction of the scissors housing (4) into the fitting-reception groove of the upper member of the sash/leaf frame, the opening-out arm (2), the additional arm (3) and the scissors housing (4) are brought into an aligned position. Furthermore, there is connected to the rotary-bearing part (6) a stop guide which is supported on a stop web of the sash/leaf frame and fixes the axis of the upper rotary bearing with respect to the sash/leaf. In order that the shank screws (9) can be actuated by a screwdriver, the opening-out arm (2) and the additional arm (3) are provided with mounting bores which, in the aligned position of the functional parts of the opening-out device, are in alignment with the shank screws. 2.3 The method of mounting is used for windows or doors which can pivot and/or tilt.

A method of mounting a stay device (1) to a movable portion of a 
window or a door of a rotary-tilt design, wherein the stay device (1) has a 

stay arm (2) with additional arm (3), which stay arm can be hingedly 
connected to the fixed frame by means of a rotary mounting portion (6) and 

the end of the stay arm that is towards the upper horizontal frame member 
of the frame (13) of the movable window or door portion is connected 

slidably to a scissor housing (4) which can be introduced into a fitment 
receiving groove of said frame member of the frame (13) of the movable 

window or door portion, and the additional arm (3) of the stay arm is 
rotatably connected to the scissor housing (4), the scissor housing (4) can 

be fixed by at least one fixing screw (9) to the movable window or door 
portion, and wherein the rotary mounting portion (6) fixed to the stay arm 

(2) is provided with a receiving bore (7) for the pin of the rotary 
mounting, characterised in that the fixing screw (9) is a shank screw (9), 

the scissor housing (4) can be fixed by said at least one shank screw (9) 
which can be screwed into the bottom of the fitment receiving groove (11) 

of the movable window or door portion, and that a trunnion (27, 28) of a 
stop gauge (26) is fitted into the receiving bore (7) of the rotary 

mounting portion (6), the stay device is put into a closed position in 
which the stay arm (2) and the additional arm (3) align with the scissor 

housing, the scissor housing (4) is introduced into the fitment receiving 
groove (11) until the stop gauge (26) bears against a stop limb portion 

(29) of the frame (13) of the movable window or door portion and the 
trunnion screw (9) is screwed in by a screwdriver fitted through a mounting 

bore in the stay arm (2) or through aligned mounting bores (22-25) in the 
stay arm (2) and in the additional arm (3). 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the holding 
block (5) is secured to the frame of the movable window or door portion by 

two shank screws (9) and two mounting bores (22, 23, 24, 25) are provided 
in each of the stay arm (2) and the additional arm (3).
