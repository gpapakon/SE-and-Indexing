<ABSTRACT>
A filter module allows controlling network security by 
specifying security rules for traffic in the network and 

accepting or dropping communication packets according to these 
security rules. A set of security rules are defined in a high 

level form and are translated into a packet filter code. The 
packet filter code is loaded into packet filter modules 

located in strategic points in the network. Each packet 
transmitted or received at these locations is inspected by 

performing the instructions in the packet filter code. The 
result of the packet filter code operation decides whether to 

accept (pass) or reject (drop) the packet, disallowing the 
communication attempt.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates, in general, to a method for
controlling computer network security. More specifically it
relates to an easily alterable or expandable method for
computer network security which controls information flow on
the network from/to external and internal destinations.Connectivity and security are two conflicting objectives
in the computing environment of most organizations. The
typical modern computing system is built around network
communications, supplying transparent access to a multitude of
services. The global availability of these services is
perhaps the single most important feature of modern computing
solutions. Demand for connectivity comes both from within
organizations and from outside them.Protecting network services from unauthorized usage is of
paramount importance to any organization. UNIX workstations,
for example, once connected to the Internet, will offer all
the services which it offers another station on the next table
to the entire world. Using current technology, an
organization must give up much of its connectivity in order to
prevent vulnerability, even to the extent of eliminating all
connections to the outside world or other sites.As the need for increased security grows, the means of
controlling access to network resources has become an
administrative priority. In order to save cost and maintain 
and other objects,productivity, access control must be simple
to configure and transparent to users and applications. The
minimization of setup costs and down time are also important
factors.Packet filtering is a method which allows connectivity
yet provides security by controlling the traffic being passed,
thus preventing illegal communication attempts, both within
single networks and between connected networks.Current implementation of packet filtering allows
specification of access list tables according to a fixed
format. This method is limited in its flexibility to express
a given organization's security policy. It is also limited to
the set of protocols and services defined in that particular
table. This method does not allow the introduction of
different protocols or services which are not specified in the
original table.Another method of implementing packet filtering is
tailoring the computer operating system code manually in every
strategic point in the organization. This method is limited
by its flexibility to future changes in network topology, new
protocols, enhanced services and to future security threats.
It requires a large amount of work by experts
