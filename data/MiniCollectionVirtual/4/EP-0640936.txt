<ABSTRACT>
A data processing device comprises a touch screen with a touch position 
sensor. The position sensor is suitable to detect a touch position on the screen from a 

change in a current pattern in a conductive panel. The device also comprises a touch 
force sensor provided with a second conductive panel which extends substantially 

parallel to the touch screen. The screen is at least partly movable relative to the second 
panel in a direction transversely of the second panel. The force sensor is suitable to 

determine a force from a capacitance value between the touch screen and the second 
panel. The device is suitable for the combined processing of the position and force 

detected in response to touching.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a data processing device, comprising a touch
screen with a touch position sensor which comprises a first conductive panel and is
suitable to detect a touch position on the screen from a change in a current pattern in
the first panel. A data processing device of this kind is known from United States Patent
Specification No. 4,853,498.
A data processing device comprising a touch screen
with a position and force sensor is known from
RESEARCH DISCLOSURE, no. 302, June 1998, HAVANT 6B
page 456, RD 30289.During use the position sensor for example applies the same electric
voltage, to a plurality of locations on the first panel. When the panel is touched or
approached by a finger or any other at least slightly conductive object, a capacitive
effect is produced so that current is drained from the panel. The position sensor can
deduce the position where the touch surface has been touched or approached by
measuring the amount of current drained from the various locations on the panel
whereto the voltage is applied.Preferably, the touch force is determined simultaneously with the position.
In that case, for example
the thickness of lines drawn by means of the position sensor can be adjusted in
proportion to the force used,a distinction can be made between different types of use, such as control of
cursor motions or icon selection, on the basis of different forces,a selection of a menu item can be confirmed by exerting additional force.It is an object of the invention to provide a data processing device which
is suitable to measure the touch position as well as the touch force in response to
touching.To achieve this, the data processing device in accordance with the
invention is defined by the subject-matter of Claim 1. The device comprises a touch force sensor which is
provided with a second conductive panel which is arranged substantially parallel to the
touch screen which touch screen is at least partly movable relative to the second panel
in a direction transversely of the second panel, the force sensor being arranged to
determine a force from a capacitance value between the touch screen and the second 
panel, and the device being arranged for the combined processing of the position and
force detected in response to touching. The touch screen and the second panel constitute
respective plates of a capacitor. When a force is exerted on the touch screen, these
plates move towards one another, so that the capacitance value of the capacitor changes.
The capacitance value is, therefore, a
