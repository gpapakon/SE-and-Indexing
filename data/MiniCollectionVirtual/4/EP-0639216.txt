<ABSTRACT>
A catalytic cracking process and apparatus therefor are described, wherein hot, active cracking catalyst particles are circulated from a regenerator (12) to a reactor (11) wherein they are brought into contact with a hydrocarbon feed to convert the latter to cracked products. The cracked products and resultingly spent catalyst particles are separately recovered and the spent particles are passed to a stripping zone (22) for contact with a stripping gas to remove therefrom strippable hydrocarbon materials, which also are recovered. The stripped catalyst particles are circulated to the regenerator (12) for contact with an oxygen-containing gas to reactivate and heat them before recirculation to the reactor (11). At least some of the hot regenerated catalyst particles are passed through an indirect heat exchanger in indirect heat exchange with at least some of the stripped catalyst particles whereby the former are cooled and the latter are heated. The regenerated catalyst which contacts the feed is thus cooler than it would otherwise be, and there is a reduction in thermal cracking. The stripped catalyst entering the regenerator is hotter than it would otherwise be thereby improving the efficacy of the regeneration step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalytic
cracking process and apparatus therefor.In conventional catalytic cracking, particles of
cracking catalyst are contacted in a reaction zone with
a hydrocarbon feed at catalyst temperatures which are
sufficiently high to cause a reasonable percentage
conversion of the feed with an acceptable amount of
by-product such as coke and normally gaseous products.
The coke is deposited on the catalyst particles and is
removed therefrom by contacting the coked catalyst
particles with an oxygen-containing gas in a regenerator
whereby coke is removed by exothermic oxidation which
heats the catalyst particles as they are thus
regenerated. The heated regenerated particles are
contacted with further amounts of hydrocarbon feed.A factor determining the temperature of the heated
regenerated particles is the amount of coke-removal in
the regenerator. If the feed is of the type which
causes relatively large coke deposits, the oxidation of
the coke can result in heated regenerated catalyst
particles whose temperature is so high that upon contact
with the feed, coke (and light hydrocarbon gases) are
formed as by-products in amounts which are significantly
detrimental to the economics of the catalytic cracking
operation. It is accepted that coke must be removed
from used catalyst particles in order to regenerate the
catalytic properties of the particles. It will be
appreciated from the foregoing that in catalyst cracking 
operations wherein the heat produced by coke oxidation
results in excessively high regenerated catalyst
temperatures, there can be detriment to the economics of
the catalytic cracking operation.It is known to cool catalyst particles circulating
in a fluidized catalytic cracking unit ("FCCU"). For
example, United States' patent documents US-A-2862798;
US-A-2970117; US-A-2492948; US-A-2506123; US-A-2596748
and US-A-2377935 each discloses passing some hot
regenerated cracking catalyst particles from the
regenerator in indirect heat exchange with a cooling
fluid. In some instances, the thus-cooled regenerated
catalyst particles are returned to the regeneration zone
to moderate the temperature therein. United States'
patent document US-A-4820404 discloses cooling spent or
used catalyst from the catalyst stripper by indirect
heat exchange with a cooling fluid to moderate the
temperature in part of the regenerator.In all the foregoing instances, the sole cooling
fluid which is specifically identified is water. The
cooling of catalyst particles by indirect heat exchange
