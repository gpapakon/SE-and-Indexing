<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for effectively and 
efficiently interconnecting a first rigid circuit with 

a second rigid circuit. The interconnected circuit 
system includes, in addition to the first and second 

circuits, a compressive conductive member and a rigid 
conductive member. The first circuit has means for 

interconnecting engagement with the compressive 
conductive member. The second circuit has means for 

interconnecting engagement with the rigid conductive 
member. The compressive conductive member has a first 

end for interconnecting engagement with the first 
circuit and a second end for interconnecting engagement 

with a first end of the rigid conductive member. The 
rigid conductive member has a first end for 

interconnecting engagement with the compressive 
conductive member and a second end for interconnecting 

engagement with the second circuit. The first end of 
the compressive conductive member interconnectingly 

engages with the first end of the rigid conductive 
member. The second end of the rigid conductive member 

interconnectingly engages with the first circuit and 
the second end of the compressive conductive member 

interconnectingly engages with the second circuit. In 
this way, the first circuit and the second circuit 

together form a completed electrical circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the electrical 
interconnection of circuits, and more particularly to 
such interconnects which are especially adapted for 
making external electrical connections to thermal ink 
jet printheads. It is known to provide heater resistors on a 
common substrate, such as silicon, and employ these 
resistors to transfer thermal energy to corresponding 
adjacent ink reservoirs during a thermal ink jet 
printing operation in the manufacture of thin film 
resistors substrates for thermal ink jet printheads. 
This thermal energy will cause the ink in the 
reservoirs to be heated to boiling and thereby be 
ejected through an orifice in an adjacent nozzle plate 
from which it is directed onto a print medium. These 
heater resistors are electrically pulsed during such 
operation by current applied thereto via conductive 
traces formed on top of the silicon substrates and 
insulated therefrom by an intermediate dielectric 
layer. The formation of an intermediate dielectric 
layer, the formation of the resistive layer for the  
 
heater resistors, and the aluminum evaporation of 
sputtering process for forming electrical patterns of 
conductive trace material to the heater resistors are 
all well known in the art and therefore are not 
described in further detail herein. The processes used 
in the fabrication of thermal ink jet printheads are 
discussed in the Hewlett Packard Journal, Volume 36, 
Number 5, May 1985 ("HP Journal Article"). Electrical connections are provided between 
external pulse drive circuits and the conductive traces 
on the thermal ink jet printhead using flex or "flex" 
circuits to make removable pressure contacts to certain 
conductive terminal pads on thin film resistor 
printhead substrates or to tape automated bonding (TAB) 
circuits. These electrical connections are facilitated 
by applying pressure to the flex circuit so that the 
electrical leads therein make good electrical 
connection with corresponding mating pads on the thin 
film resistor printhead substrate. These flex circuit 
generally comprise photolithographically defined 
conductive patterns formed by various etching processes 
carried out on a thin flex insulating substrate member. 
The electrical contact locations on the flex circuit 
will be raised slightly in a bump and dimple 
configuration. This configuration is formed using a  
 
punch structure which matches the location of the 
correspondingly dimples. The punch structure is used 
to form the electrical contact locations on the flex
