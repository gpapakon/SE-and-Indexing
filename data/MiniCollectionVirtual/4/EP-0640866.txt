<ABSTRACT>
Semiconductor layers (1) define a PIN superstructure, the intrinsic part (I) of which comprises a series of layers (SL) forming quantum wells; it is capable, within a spectral range, of optical absorption dependent on the electric field. Working light, lying within the said spectral range, is admitted into the series of quantum-well layers, this light photocreating, in the said series of layers, electron-hole pairs by photon absorption. The number, types and geometries of the layers of the said series of layers (SL) are chosen so that the said series of layers produces a superlattice capable, on the one hand, of the Wannier-Stark effect and, on the other hand, of generating, at rest, a self-established electric field because of the potential difference naturally set up at its terminals by the PIN superstructure. The combined effect, on the photocreated electron-hole pairs, of the said Wannier-Stark effect and of the said electric field self-established at rest generates a self-amplifying effect of the absorption variations of the said series of layers (SL). This provides an "all optical" bistable effect without requiring recourse to an external electrical circuit.

Semiconductor device having optical bistability, of the type comprising: 

semiconductor layers (1) forming a PIN superstructure whose intrinsic part (I), 
which comprises a sequence of layers forming a superlattice of quantum wells (SL), 

is capable, on the one hand, of the Wannier-Stark effect, and, on the other hand, in 
a range of the spectrum, of optical absorption depending on the electrical field, 
light input means to admit into the sequence of quantum well layers a working 
light located in the said range of the spectrum, the said working light being capable 

of creating electron-hole pairs by photoconductivity in the said PIN structure, by 
absorption of photons, and 
output means for collecting the said light after its passage through the sequence 
of layers (SL), 
 
characterized in that the number, the natures and the geometries of the layers of 

the sequence (SL) of quantum well layers of the superlattice are selected in such a 
way that the superlattice is capable of generating in the resting state an electrical 

field which is self-created as a result of the potential difference established naturally 
at its terminals by the PIN superstructure, 


and in that the combined effect of the said Wannier-Stark effect and of the said 
electrical field which is self-created in the resting state on the electron-hole pairs 

created by photoconductivity generates an effect of self-amplification of the 
variations of absorption of the said sequence (SL), 
which produces a "wholly optical" bistable effect without the necessity of using an 
extemal active or passive electrical circuit. 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the number, the natures and 
the geometries of the layers are selected in such a way that the amplitude of the  

 
self-created electrical field is located, in the resting state, in the strong electrical field 

region of a negative electro-absorption domain of the sequence of quantum well 
layers (SL), at the wavelength of the working light. 
Device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the negative electro-absorption 
domain is due to the displacement of the oblique transitions of the 

Wannier-Stark effect as a function of the electrical field. 
Device as claimed in one of Claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the superlattice 
(SL) satisfies the condition
 
   Eg/N. D
opt
 slightly greater than approximately 1,
 
where: 


Eg is the energy of the forbidden band of the superlattice, 
N is the number of quantum wells in the superlattice, and 
D
opt
 is the width of the optical band of the superlattice. 
Device as claimed in Claim 4, characterized by the condition Eg/N. D
opt
 less than 
approximately 3. 
Device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
working light is substantially perpendicular to the layers, permitting an arrangement 

in large matrices. 
Device as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that the semiconductor layers 
comprise at least two sequences of layers (SL1, SL2) forming superlattices having 

the Wannier-Stark effect, sandwiched with layers forming with them at least two 
altemating PIN superstructures. 
Device as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that the semiconductor layers are 
housed in a Fabry-Pérot cavity (DM1, DM2) for the wavelength of the working light, 

while the light input means apply the working light to a first end of this cavity, and 
the output means collect the said light at a second end substan
tially opposite the 
first end. 
Signal processing process in which:  
 


a) a working light (I
in
), which has a chosen wavelength and whose amplitude is 
representative of a signal, is generated; 
b) a stack (1) of semiconductor layers is provided to form a PIN superstructure 
whose intrinsic part (I), which comprises a sequence of layers forming a superlattice 

of quantum wells (SL), is capable, on the one hand, of the Wannier-Stark effect, 
and, on the other hand, of optical absorption depending on the electrical field, in a 

range of the spectrum including the said chosen wavelength, and 
c) the working light (I
in
) is applied to the input of the PIN superstructure to create 
electron-hole pairs by photoconductivity in the sequence of quantum well layers 

(SL), by absorption of photons, 
 
characterized in that the number, the natures and the geometries of the layers of 

the sequence (SL) of quantum well layers of the superlattice are selected in such a 
way that the superlattice is capable of generating in the resting state an electrical 

field which is self-created as a result of the potential difference established naturally 
at its terminals by the PIN superstructure, 


and in that the combined effect of the said Wannier-Stark effect and of the said 
electrical field which is self-created in the resting state on the electron-hole pairs 

created by photoconductivity generates an effect of self-amplification of the 
variations of absorption of the said sequence (SL), 
in such a way that, when stage c) is carried out, a region of hysteresis appears in 
the response curve of the light intensity of the light leaving the PIN superstructure 

as a function of the intensity of the working light at the input of the said PIN 
superstructure. 
Process as claimed in Claim 9, characterized in that the number, the natures 
and the geometries of the layers are selected in such a way that the amplitude of 

the self-created electrical field is located, in the resting state, in the strong electrical 
field region of a negative electro-absorption domain of the sequence of quantum 

well layers (SL), at the wavelength of the working light.
