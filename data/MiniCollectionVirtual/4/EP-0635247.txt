<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of applying a torque onto the cubital axis of an upper arm prosthesis for pivoting the forearm by means of a spring force, as well as to an elbow lifting device. The elbow lifting device comprises an upper arm member (1) which is connected in articulated fashion to a forearm member (2) via at least one cubital axis (3), pivoting of the forearm member being assisted by a spring element (6). The spring element (6) exerts a tensile force directly or indirectly upon the entry (17) to a gear (7) whose exit (18) engages on the inner end of a tensile member (9) whose outer end can be fixed on a fixing point (20) of the upper arm member (1) which defines a torque lever with the cubital axis (3). The force is transmitted by the gear (7) in such a way that the course of the torque acting upon the fixing point (20) of the upper arm member (1) as a function of the bending angle of the forearm member (2) is approximately parabola-shaped and shows its minimum values in the extended position from about 5 DEG  to 25 DEG , preferably 10 DEG  to 20 DEG  and at maximum flexion, and shows its maximum at about 90 DEG .

Process for the application of a torque to the elbow
axis of an upper-arm prosthesis with a view to

pivoting the forearm with the aid of a spring force,

characterised in that
 the torque curve as a function
of the bending angle of the forearm is substantially

parabolic and exhibits its lowest values in the
extended position of substantially 5° to 25°,

preferably 10° to 20°, and also at maximal bending and
exhibits its maximum at substantially 90°.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the spring force is varied by means of an electrical
adjustment as a function of the bending angle and also

of the torque curve and/or is reinforced by means of
an additional torque which is applied electrically.
Elbow lifter for an arm prosthesis, the upper-arm
mating part (1) of which is connected in articulated

manner via at least one elbow axis (3) to a forearm
mating part (2), the pivoting of which is assisted by

a spring element (6) pertaining to the elbow lifter,

characterised by
 a gear mechanism (7), the input (17)
of which is acted upon by the spring element (6) with a

tensile force and the output (18) of which is applied
to the inner end of a tensile member (9) provided with

an inner end and an outer end, the outer end of said
tensile member being capable of being secured to a

fixed point (20) of the upper-arm mating part (1)
defining a torque lever with the elbow axis (3), the

transfer of force being effected by the gear mechanism
(7) in such a way that the curve of the torque applied

to the fixed point (20) of the upper-arm mating part
(1) as a function of the bending angle of the forearm

mating part (2) is substantially parabolic and
exhibits its lowest values in the extended position of 

substantially 5° to 25°, preferably 10° to 20°, and
also at maximal bending and exhibits its maximum at

substantially 90°.
