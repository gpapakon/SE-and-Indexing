<DESCRIPTION>
Occlusive arterial disease is commonly treated 
by bypassing the occluded vessel. The most successful 
treatment is achieved through the use of autogenous vein 
grafts. However, when vein is not available synthetic 
grafts made of such materials as expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene or polyethyleneterephthalate are 
substituted. The surgical application or small caliber 
synthetic vascular grafts for medium or small vessel 
bypass is limited by frequent graft occlusion due to the 
thrombogenic nature of currently available graft 
materials. In small vessel grafts, blood flow is reduced 
and there is a rapid adsorption and accumulation of blood 
proteins on the graft surface. Shortly after implantation 
in a patient, the luminal aspect of a prosthetic vascular 
graft heals by the formation of a surface of fibrin 
referred to as the pseudointima. Thrombin binds to this 
fibrin pseudointima, where it can contribute to platelet 
activation and the formation of platelet rich thrombi. 
Bound thrombin may also contribute to further fibrin 
accretion that in turn leads to distal embolism. The seeding of vascular grafts with endothelial 
cells has been proposed as a solution to the problem of 
thrombogenicity (reviewed by Mosquera and Goldman, Br. J. 
Surg.78: 656-660, 1991). Although endothelial seeding of 
grafts has shown beneficial results in experimental 
settings, the technology has not progessed to the point 
that seeded grafts suitable for routine use can be 
produced. EP-A-366546 discloses medical materials which are coated 
with a polymerised protein layer. C.A. 107, 223 225 describes biolized polymers for cardiovascular 
applications.  
 There is a clear need in the art for 
biologically compatible, synthetic materials having 
reduced thrombogenicity. Such materials should be 
resistant to the deposition of blood proteins and to 
platelet adherence. These materials would be useful as 
vascular grafts, synthetic heart valves, artificial organs 
and in any prosthetic application where the material will 
be exposed to blood and a potential for thrombogenesis 
exists. The present invention provides such materials and 
methods for preparing the materials. Materials prepared 
in accordance with the methods of the present invention 
are also useful as experimental models in the study of 
thrombogenic and fibrinolytic processes. The present invention provides methods for 
coating surfaces of polymeric materials with fibrinogen 
and fibrin. Within one embodiment, the polymeric material 
is polyethylene,
