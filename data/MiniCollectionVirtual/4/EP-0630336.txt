<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an inflatable life jacket which is held in a horse-shoe shaped cover from which the jacket breaks free when inflated. The jacket has two legs (34, 36) and a rear jacket (44, 46). The rear portion (44, 46) fits behind the user's head and the legs (34, 36) locate to opposite sides of the user's chest. The legs (34, 36) are approximately of equal length but their inner edges are profiled so that one has a major section (42) which extends across the user's chest and a minor lobe (40) which lies adjacent the user's neck and the other leg (36) has a major lobe (38) which also extends across the user's chest and registers with a narrow portion of the other leg lying between the major section (42) and inner lobe (40) so as to interfit with said narrow portion and to underlie (at least partially) said other leg (36) to prevent the formation of a water channel between the legs (34, 36). The rear portion has extension lobes (44, 46) to increase buoyancy behind the head.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inflatable life jackets. Inflatable life jackets are worn by personnel who work in an 
environment or circumstances where there is the danger or 
risk that they will have to survive being placed in the sea 
or another body of water, the life jacket providing the 
necessary buoyancy to keep the person afloat for long 
periods. Typically, life jackets may be used by pilots, 
particularly helicopter pilots and their passengers, services 
personnel in transit on or over water, and personnel such as 
off-shore platform workers whose job involves the risk or 
danger of their being placed in the sea in emergency 
conditions. Inflatable life jackets may be loose items which are placed 
on the person in the event of an emergency, but in more 
common practise today in relation to those personnel whose 
work involves constant danger that at any time they may be 
placed in the sea, the inflatable life jackets are 
permanently worn in readiness for such emergencies. The 
inflatable life jacket may be an item which is fitted to the 
user's body by means of a harness and buckles and the like, 
or it may in turn be permanently fixed to for example an 
abandonment suit which is of a type to protect the user 
against hypothermia in the event that the user in an 
emergency may have to spend time in the water. This 
arrangement will be adopted in cases where because of the 
user's environment emergency circumstances resulting in the 
person being placed in the water may arise at short notice, 
the person not having sufficient time to don the abandonment 
suit and the life jacket. Because of their function, life jackets have been developed  
 
in a number of respects including that the jacket is 
automatically inflated, for example by a pressure and/or 
water sensitive device, in the event of the user falling into 
the water. They may alternatively be inflated by manual 
actuation of a mechanism which releases the inflating medium. 
The inflating medium typically is a cartridge of a liquid 
which is held under pressure and which flashes to a gas upon 
release of that pressure. Such inflation medium may for 
example be carbon dioxide. Furthermore, when the life jacket is carried by the person it 
is in a collapsed or deflated state, and may be held in a 
flexible cover or casing which opens in controlled fashion 
under the inflating influence of the life jacket. Some life jackets are single cavity jackets, whilst others 
are double cavity jackets. With a single cavity jacket, two 
panels of sheet

<CLAIMS>
An inflatable life jacket (10) comprising two buoyancy 
sections (34, 36) respectively for location at opposite sides 

of the chest, characterised in that the sections (34, 36) are 
asymetric one relative to the other and interfit in the 

central region of the chest thereby to prevent the creation 
of a channel for the flow of water towards the user's mouth 

when in in-use condition. 
A life jacket according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that one (36) of said buoyancy sections has a major portion 

(42) which extends across the front of the user's chest and 
is located a first distance from the user's neck, and the 

other section (34) has a major lobe portion (38) which 
extends across the user's chest, and is located a second 

distance from the user's neck which is less than said first 
distance. 
A life jacket according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that said one section (36) has a major lobe (40) spaced from 

the major portion (42) by a reduced width portion with which 
the major lobe (38) of the other section (34) registers. 
A life jacket according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised 
in that said portions (34, 36) comprise legs (34, 36) of 

equal or substantially equal length. 
A life jacket according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that a portion of the jacket which extends 

to the rear of the user's head (64) is provided with 
extension lobes (44, 46). 
A life jacket according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the jacket (10) is contained in a cover  

 
from which it releases upon inflation. 
A life jacket according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the cover is substantially horse-shoe shaped with the 

respective sections (34, 36) on the respective legs of the 
horse-shoe shape. 
A life jacket according to Claim 6 or 7, characterised 
in that the life jacket is embodied in a user's garment.
