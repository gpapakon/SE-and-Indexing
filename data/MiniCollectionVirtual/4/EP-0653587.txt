<ABSTRACT>
A luminaire, for example a luminaire for 
emergency lighting, comprises a light source (1) and an 

optical element (3) mounted behind the light source. The 
element is shaped as a fresnel type element so that 

substantially all the light impinging upon it from the 
light source is redirected at a specific angle, typically 

60° to the central axis of the luminaire. 
The element increases the light output over a 

specific area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to luminaires. In
particular, but not exclusively, it relates to emergency
luminaires which are generally battery operated and are
intended to come into operation upon failure of the mains
supply in a building. The invention is also applicable to
luminaires in general.The term luminaire is generally used to define a
light fitting generally comprising a light source which is
often a fluorescent lamp, a simple reflector or cover
behind the lamp and (usually) a diffuser cover to protect
the lamp from dirt or mechanical damage. The maximum
light output from such a luminaire is directly in front of
(or under) the luminaire and decreases with distance from
the maximum point. The plain reflector behind the lamp
reflects a portion of the back light that would otherwise
be wasted. However, this light is allowed to be dispersed
in all directions and hence is largely lost.Luminaires, in particular luminaires for
emergency lighting, are installed to ensure that at least
a certain light level is achieved over a specified area.
This means that in use a large proportion of the area
specified will be illuminated to a level greater than is
required in order to illuminate the total area with the
threshold light level. Thus, the total area is smaller
than could be theoretically achieved from a given battery
and lamp combination.US 4,081,667 discloses a lighting fixture having
a light source disposed below a fresnel type reflector.
The light source must be accurately positioned relative to
the reflector.It is an object of the present invention to
provide an improved luminaire.According to the present invention there is
provided a luminaire, comprising a light source, and light 
redirecting means disposed behind the light source to
cause light impinging upon it from the light source over a
range or ranges of angles to be redirected at a chosen
angle, characterised in that the redirecting means is a
fresnel type lens having a first plurality of inclined
faces at a lens surface nearest the light source, and a
second plurality of inclined faces at a lens surface
furthest from the light source, such that light from any
point on the central axis (A) of the redirecting element
is redirected at the chosen angle.If a luminaire is intended to be ceiling- or
wall-mounted, then the redirecting means will generally,
in use, be disposed between the light source and the
ceiling or wall respectively. It may be in other
relative positions, however.The luminaire may include a rear wall, and a
separate redirecting

<CLAIMS>
A luminaire, comprising a light source (1) and
means (3) disposed behind the light source to cause light

impinging upon it from the light source over a range or
ranges of angles to be redirected at a chosen angle,

characterised in that the redirecting element is a fresnel
type lens having a first plurality of inclined faces (5)

at a lens surface nearest the light source, and a second
plurality of inclined faces (6) at a lens surface furthest

from the light source, such that light from any point on
the central axis (A) of the redirecting element is

redirected at the chosen angle.
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 1, further
comprising a rear wall (2), the redirecting means being

interposed between the light source and the rear wall.
A luminaire as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the
redirecting means is an integral part of a rear wall of

the luminaire.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the redirection means is shaped

to cause redirection of light by total internal
reflection.
A luminaire as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the chosen angle is 60°
 to the central axis.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, including means (4) for attaching the

redirection means to the luminaire.
A luminaire as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the redirecting means is an

optical element shaped substantially as shown in Figure 3
of the accompanying drawings.
