In a preferred embodiment, the two light-emitting diodes (6, 6', ...; 7, 7', ...) comprise a blue light-emitting diode (6, 6', ...) and a red light-emitting diode (7, 7', ...), and the conversion means (10) comprise a luminescent material which can be excited by blue light and which converts blue light to green light. In another preferred embodiment, the luminescent material is sensitive to light originating from a wavelength range from 500 to 560 nm. In a preferred embodiment, the two light-emitting diodes comprise a blue light-emitting diode and a green light-emitting diode, and the conversion means comprise a luminescent material which can be excited by the green light and which converts said green light to red light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a lighting system comprising at least two light-emitting diodes, each of said light-emitting diodes emitting, in operation, visible light in a preselected wavelength range.Lighting systems based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are used as a source of white light for general lighting applications.A lighting system of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is known. In recent years, apart from red light-emitting diodes based on GaP, also efficient, blue light-emitting diodes and green light-emitting diodes based on GaN have been developed. In order to produce white light, in principle, three LEDs are necessary as the primary light source, namely a blue, a green and a red LED.It is a drawback of such lighting systems that a combination of three LEDs as the primary light source does not always lead to the desired color rendition, which can be attributed to the fact that LEDs with spectral maxima in the desired spectral regions which at the same time are sufficiently energy-efficient are not available or short.It is an object of the invention to provide a lighting system of the type described in the opening paragraph, which exhibits an improved color rendition. The invention further aims at improving the luminous efficacy of the lighting system.To achieve this, the lighting system of the type described in the opening paragraph is characterized in accordance with the invention in that the lighting system includes conversion means for converting a part of the visible light emitted by one of the light-emitting diodes into visible light in a further wavelength range so as to optimize the color rendition of the lighting system.The conversion means are excited by light originating from one of the at least two LEDs. A part of this light is converted by the conversion means, for example via a process of absorption and emission, into visible light in the further wavelength range. This results in a lighting system which comprises, in fact, three light sources, namely two primary light sources which are formed by the at least two LEDs, which primary light sources each emit visible light in a preselected wavelength range, and one so-called secondary light source which emits visible light in the further wavelength range. By a suitable choice of the wavelength ranges in which these two primary light sources and the secondary light source emit visible light, a lighting system is obtained having an improved color rendition relative to a lighting system based on the two primary light sources.
