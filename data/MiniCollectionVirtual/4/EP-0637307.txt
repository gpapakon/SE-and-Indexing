<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a class of
substituted imidazole, triazole and tetrazole derivatives
which act on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors, being
selective agonists of so-called "5-HT1-like" receptors.
They are therefore useful in the treatment of clinical
conditions for which a selective agonist of these
receptors is indicated.5-HT1-like receptor agonists which exhibit
selective vasoconstrictor activity have recently been
described as being of use in the treatment of migraine
(see, for example, A. Doenicke et al., The Lancet, 1988,
Vol. 1, 1309-11). The compounds of the present
invention, being selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonists,
are accordingly of particular use in the treatment of
migraine and associated conditions, e.g. cluster
headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, headache
associated with vascular disorders, tension headache and
paediatric migraine.The present invention provides a compound of
formula I, or a salt thereof:

wherein the broken circle represents two non-adjacent
double bonds in any position in the five-membered ring;
two, three or four of W, X, Y and Z represent
nitrogen and the remainder represent carbon provided 
that, when two of W, X, Y and Z represent nitrogen and
the remainder represent carbon, then the said nitrogen
atoms are in non-adjacent positions within the five-membered
ring;A1 represents hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, benzyl or amino;A2 represents a non-bonded electron pair when
all four of W, X, Y and Z represent nitrogen; or, when
two or three of W, X, Y and Z represent nitrogen and the
remainder represent carbon, A2 represents hydrogen,
methyl, ethyl, benzyl or amino;E represents a straight or branched
alkylene chain containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;F represents a group of formula
U represents nitrogen or C-R2;B represents oxygen, sulphur or N-R3;R1 represents -CH2.CHR4.NR6R7 or a group of
formula 

in which the broken line represents an optional chemical
bond; andR2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 independently represent
hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl.For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds
of formula I will be non-toxic pharmaceutically
acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in
the preparation of the compounds according to the
invention or of their non-toxic pharmaceutically
acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable
salts of the compounds of this invention include acid
addition salts which may, for example, be formed by
mixing a solution of the compound according to the
invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically
acceptable
