<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a laminated heat exchanger capable of exchanging heat between a first fluid and a second fluid. It comprises a casing through which the second fluid can pass, a stack of plates (26) arranged in pairs alternately inside the casing along a stacking direction (XX), so that the plates of one and the same pair define between them a circulation lamina for the first fluid, communication openings (52, 54) made through each plate for allowing circulation of the first fluid between the successive pairs of plates, and flow-perturbation elements (66) housed in the circulation laminas of the first fluid. Each plate (26) has substantially the shape of a square, the two communication openings (52, 54) being arranged aligned in an alignment direction (A) parallel to two sides of the square and each perturbation element (66) including corrugation lines (82) which extend in a direction perpendicular to the alignment direction (A). Application in particular to oil radiators for a motor vehicle.

A plate-type heat exchanger for effecting heat
transfer between a first fluid, for example an oil to

be cooled, and a second fluid, for example a coolant
liquid, comprising:


a casing (10) arranged for the second fluid to pass
through it;
a stack of plates (26) arranged in pairs (26-1, 26-2)
alternately within the casing and defining a stacking

direction (XX), in such a way that the plates of a
given pair delimit
 between them a flow passage (48) for
the first fluid;
two communication apertures (52, 54) formed through
each plate for permitting the flow of the first fluid

between the successive pairs of plates from an inlet
(94) for the first fluid to an outlet (50) for the

first fluid;
each plate (26-1, 26-2) being of substantially square
form and the two communication apertures (52, 54) of

each plate being arranged on either side of the
stacking direction (XX) and lying in an alignment

direction (A) parallel to two sides (30, 34) of the
square, characterised in that perturbator elements (66)

mounted within the flow passages (48) for the first
fluid, in that each perturbator element (66) comprises

corrugation lines in the form of fins (82) which extend
in a direction parallel to the alignment direction (A)

of the apertures in the plates, and in that the two 
communication apertures (52, 54) in each plate (26) are

of a generally square or generally rectangular form
having sides which are generally parallel to the sides

of the plate (26).
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the corrugations comprise flat
segments (84, 86, 88) which are joined in pairs through

an obtuse angle.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,

characterised in that the corrugations in two adjacent
corrugation lines (82) are staggered with respect to

each other.
A heat exchanger according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that each

perturbator element (66) is in the form of a pressed
component of generally square form, having a central

aperture (80) of elongated form.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1,

characterised in that one (52) of the communication
apertures in each plate, which serves for entry of the

first fluid, has a square form, while the other
communication aperture (54), which serves as the outlet

for the first fluid, is rectangular in form, with the
larger dimension of the rectangle extending

transversely to the alignment direction (A) of the two
communication apertures (52, 54).
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the casing (10) has a transverse
cross section which is substantially square and which 

is bounded by four flat lateral faces (12, 14, 16, 18)
of substantially rectangular form.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 6,

characterised in that one (12) of the four lateral
faces of the casing serves as an attachment face, and

is provided with an inlet tube branch (22) and an
outlet tube branch (24) for the second fluid, with the

two tube branches being open respectively into two
symmetrical portions of the attachment face which

extend on either side of a median line (L) which is
parallel to the stacking direction (XX).
A heat exchanger according to Claim 7,

characterised in that each said plate (26) has, on the
same side as the attachment face, a non-rectilinear

front edge (28) comprising two straight portions (28-1
and 28-2) joined together through an obtuse angle, the

apex (38) of which abuts against the attachment face at
the level of the median line (L) of the latter.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 7,

characterised in that each said plate (26) of the stack
includes a boss (62) which extends outwardly and in the

alignment direction (A) of the communication apertures
(52, 54).
A heat exchanger according to Claim 8,

characterised in that each said plate (26) of the stack
has a boss (62) which extends outwardly and in the

alignment direction (A) of the communication apertures
(52, 54), and which terminates at the apex of the

obtuse angle (38) of the front edge (28). 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 9 or Claim 10,

characterised in that the boss (62) of each said plate
is joined to a lip (60) which surrounds one (52) of the

two communication apertures, and which is itself
connected to a lip (58) which surrounds the central

hole (56) that serves for passage through it of a
central tube (50) extending in the stacking direction

(XX).
A heat exchanger according to Claim 11,

characterised in that the plate (26) further includes a
lip (64) surrounding the other communication aperture

(54).
