<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is the use, as an agent capable of controlling the propagation of the crystallisation of maltitol present in a confection, of molecules having a molecular weight greater than 1300. This use is applied in particular to the preparation of cooked sugars and semi-crystalline articles. The invention is also aimed at the use in confectionary of a crystallisable sweetening syrup made with maltitol, having a bimodal composition spectrum and comprising more than 3% of a maltitol crystallisation propagation controlling agent having a molecular weight greater than 1300.
