<ABSTRACT>
The fitting comprises two fitting parts (1, 2) connectable to respective
pipes and provided with respective ball valves (7, 8) one of which (7) with

concavity, and coupling means (20) of the quick release type for the
aforementioned fitting parts (1, 2). It provides functional interconnection

means (40-53) that prevent the closing of the valve without concavity (8)
before the closing of the valve with concavity (7) and the release of the

coupling device (20) before the closing of the valve without concavity. Said
functional interconnection means (40-53) comprise a first control lever (40)

for the closing rotation of the valve with concavity (7), a second control
lever (45) for the closing rotation of the valve without concavity (8), that is

hinged on the same axes of the first lever (40) and has a rotation
subordinated to the removal of a mechanical block caused by said first lever

(40) in opening position. A first hydraulic cylinder (42) controls the rotation
of said first lever (40) toward a closing position of the valve with concavity

(7), and a second hydraulic cylinder (48) controls the rotation of said second
lever (45) toward a closing position of the valve without concavity (8) after

the removal of said mechanical block and, subsequently, the release of the
coupling device (20) of the two fitting parts (1, 2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a coupling device for pipes provided
with two ball valves, one of which with concavity, that are activated in a
sequence and with quick release coupling means subordinated to the closing
of both valvesPipe fittings that are formed by two parts fixed to respective pipes, that
are kept together by coupling means that allow, in case of need, the quick
separation of the two parts of the fitting, and therefore of the pipes, are
already known.Each one of the two parts of the fitting is provided with a closing valve
of the ball type, that allows the tight closing of the respective pipe before the
release of the coupling means occurs.In order to limit at the maximum the quantity of fluid that gets trapped
between the two valves and, once released, gets dispersed in the
environment, it has become usual to realise one of the two valves with a
concavity such as to allow the other valve to insert itself in it in the closing
stage.Obviously, in that case, the valve with concavity must bring itself in a
closing position before the closing movement of the other one begins and
only then the separation of the two pipes can take place.A known coupling and quick release device is described in the US
Patent 4,306,739 and comprises a articulated sequence of tightening pincers
arrangeable bridging respective circumferencial portions of terminal flanges
of the two parts of the fitting that are set alongside so as to form a coupling
ring that is open on one end, and a closing bar of said ring that is movable
upon command from a closing position to an opening position of the same 
ring.In view of this state of the art, object of the present invention has been
to provide a pipe fitting comprising two ball valves, one of which concave,
and a device for quick release coupling of the type described in the
aforementioned US patent, in which functional interconnection means such
as to determine a precise and obligatory sequence of closing operations of
the concave valve and finally of release of the coupling device are provided.According to the present invention, such object has been attained by
means of a pipe fitting as defined in claim 1.An embodiment of the fitting according to the invention is illustrated as
a non-limiting examples in the enclosed drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows in an axial section a pipe fitting according to the present
invention with two valves in an opening position;Figure 2 still shows in an axial section the aforementioned fitting with
the valve with concavity rotated into

<CLAIMS>
Pipe fittings comprising two fitting parts (1, 2) connectable with
respective pipes provided with respective ball valves (7, 8) one of which (7)

with concavity, said valves (7, 8) having respective rotating shaft (9, 10), coupling means (20) of the quick release type for the
aforementioned fitting parts (1, 2) and functional interconnection means (40-53)

such as to prevent the closing of the valve without concavity (8) before
the closing of the valve with concavity (7) and to prevent the release of the

coupling device (20) before the closing of the valve without concavity,

characterised in that
 said functional interconnection means (40-53)
comprise a first control lever (40) mechanically coupled to the shaft (9) of the valve (7) with concavity for the closing rotation of the valve with

concavity (7), a second control lever (45) mechanically coupled to the shaft (10) of the valve (8) without concavity for the closing rotation of the valve
without concavity (8), that is hinged on the same axes of the first lever (40)

and has a rotation subordinated to the removal of a mechanical block caused
by said first lever (40) in opening position, a first hydraulic cylinder (42) to

control the rotation of said first lever (40) toward a closing position of the
valve with concavity (7), and a second hydraulic cylinder (48) to control the

rotation of said second lever (45) toward a closing position of the valve
without concavity (8) after the removal of said mechanical block and,

subsequently, to control the release of the coupling device (20) of the two
fitting parts (1, 2), said

mechanical block being determined by the engagement of said first lever (40) in
a radial cut (49) of a cup shaped element (43) turning on the same axes of

the first lever (40) and rigidly connected with said second lever (45).
Pipe fitting according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 said coupling
device (20) comprises an articulated sequence of tightening pincers (21)

arrangeable across of circumferencial portions of adjacent terminal flanges
(5, 6) of the two fitting parts (1, 2) so as to form a coupling ring open on one

end, and a bar (23) for the closing of said ring that is movable upon
command from a position of closing to a position of opening of the same 

ring.

characterised in that
 said functional
interconnection means (40-53) comprise a third lever (50) that can be

activated by said second cylinder (48) after the rotation of said second lever
