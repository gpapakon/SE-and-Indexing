<ABSTRACT>
An optical scanner including a semiconductor laser 
device, aperture, collimator, cylindrical lens, polygonal 

mirror and one fϑ lens element molded from plastics. The first 
surface of the fϑ lens in a deflecting plane (or the plane 

formed by the principal rays of light as deflected by the 
polygonal mirror) is aspheric whereas the second lens surface 

is toric. When taken in the deflecting plane, the first lens 
surface has a positive value of the near-axis radius of 

curvature and, hence, it is convex toward the polygonal mirror. 
Taken in a plane crossing the deflecting plane at right angles, 

the first lens surface forms an arc of a circle having a 
negative value of the radius of curvature and, hence, it is 

concave toward the polygonal mirror. When taken in the 
deflecting plane, the second lens surface forms an arc of a 

circle having a negative value of the radius of curvature and, 
hence, it is convex toward the scanning surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning lens and an
optical scanner that uses it. More particularly, the invention
relates to a single-element scanning lens for use as an f lens
in laser scanning optics, as well as an optical scanner
equipped with this scanning lens.Optical scanners are extensively used with optical
printers, digital copiers and the like. Such optical scanners
employ a deflector such as a polygonal mirror for deflecting
incident light at a constant angular velocity in a direction
corresponding to the main scanning direction, and an f lens as
a scanning lens. The f lens has two functions; according to
one function, a laser beam that issues typically from a
semiconductor laser device and which has been deflected by the
deflector is focused as a spot on a scanning surface such as a
photoreceptor drum or belt and the other function is to move
the beam spot over the scanning surface at a constant speed.In most cases, the f lens is provided with the
capability by which the position of a deflecting point on the
deflector and the position of a beam spot on the scanning
surface are rendered to satisfy a conjugated relationship in a 
plane crossing at right angles with the plane formed by the
deflected laser beam. A cylindrical lens is positioned on the
side of the deflector where the laser beam is launched and it
has a lens powder in a direction corresponding to the sub-scanning
direction. The f lens combines with this cylindrical
lens to constitute tilt-correcting optics which corrects
optically any inclination of reflecting surfaces of the
deflector and which is capable of producing a substantially
circular beam spot.Many of the commercial f lenses available today are
optics that are composed of two or more lens elements but they
suffer from the disadvantage of complexity in construction. To
solve this problem, f lenses composed of only one lens element
have been proposed as simple optics.Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. Sho. 57-144518,
Sho. 63-50812 and Hei. 3-55513 teach one-element f
lenses having a toric surface on one side and a spherical,
cylindrical or toric surface on the other side. Japanese
Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. Sho. 62-138823, Hei. 4-50908
and Hei. 5-45580 teach f lenses having an aspheric surface.However, the conventional f lenses have their own
problems. The f lens described in Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. Sho. 57-144518 which is solely composed of
toric surfaces provides no better performance than a single
spherical lens
