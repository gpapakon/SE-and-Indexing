<ABSTRACT>
Guide rails have areas angled to one another, with at their facing face ends are connected to sheet components also with guide profiles. The sheet components (11) provided with guide profiles (6) have interconnected sheet component parts (17,18), which at their ends turned away from each other are provided with connecting devices for connection to the facing face ends of the guide rails (4,5). The sheet component parts are connected by adjustable and securable connectors (19,20) so that through a length alteration of the sheet component parts in the facing profile areas, an adjustment of the sheet length of the sheet components (11) to the actual angle between the guide rails can take place.

<CLAIMS>
An awning which is unwindable from a winding shaft and whose
unwindable end is guided with an edge bar (3) in guide rails (4, 5 and 4,

5') following the configuration of the region to be covered by the awning
and having guide profiles and the guide rails (4, 5 and 4, 5') have regions

which are arranged in angular relationship with each other and which at
their mutually facing ends (9, 10) are connected by way of arcuate elements

(11 and 11') also having guide profiles, characterised in that the arcuate
elements (11 and 11') are of a divided structure and have interconnected

arcuate element portions (17, 18 and 17', 18') which are respectively
provided with the guide profiles (6a, 6b and 6a', 6b') and which at their

mutually remote ends are provided with connecting devices (25. 26) for
connection to the mutually facing ends (9, 10) of the guide rails (4, 5 and

4, 5') and the arcuate element portions (17, 18 and 17', 18') are connected
at connecting portions (19, 20) which are displaceable and arrestable

relative to each other in a notional connecting plane between the guide
rails (4, 5 and 4, 5') with respect to each other, in such a way that

adaptation of the arcuate length of the arcuate elements (11, 11') to the
respective angle between the guide rails (4, 5 and 4, 5') can be effected by

a variation in length of the mutually facing profile regions of the arcuate
element portions (17, 18, and 17', 18').
An unwindable awning according to claim 1 characterised in that the
arcuate element portions (17, 18) are pivotable relative to each other with

their connecting portions (19, 20) about a pivot point (21a) outside the
profile regions and are arrestable relative to each other by means of an

arresting device (21).
An unwindable awning according to claim 2 characterised in that the
arresting device (21) has a screw bolt-nut arrangement. 
An unwindable awning according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the connecting devices (25, 26) are in the form of

shaped portions which are provided at the outer ends of the arcuate element
portions (17, 18 and 17', 18') and which can be inserted into the guide

profiles of the guide rails (4, 5 and 4, 5').
An unwindable awning according to one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the running surfaces (28, 29 and 28', 29') of the

arcuate element portions (17, 18 and 17', 18') have a friction-reducing
running surface covering.
An unwindable awning according to claim 3 and preferably one of
claims 4 and 5 characterised in that the screw bolt (23), outside the

screwthreaded region for the nut (24), has a running surface (37) on to
which can be fitted a further guide roller provided with bearing ends.
