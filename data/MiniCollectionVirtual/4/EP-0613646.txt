<ABSTRACT>
A beverage brewing machine which has upper (11) and lower (25) 
brewing chambers which are moveable relative to each 

other so as to clamp a strip-shaped filter (36) 
therebetween during the brewing process and the 

chambers can be separated so as to allow the filter 
strip to be removed from the brewing chamber and the 

beverage residual wiped therefrom after which the 
filter strip is returned to the brewing chambers which 

are then resealed for the next cycle. A hold down 
grid (20) engages the top surface of the filter (36) to hold it 

down as a piston (26) moves in the lower chamber (25) upwardly 
to force air through the filter to agitate the 

beverage. When the piston reaches top dead center, 
the hold down grid (20) is lifted. When the piston passes 

the opening the brewed coffee is poured. A loose 
connection is provided between the connecting rod for 

the piston and the driving crank arm so that the 
piston remains longer at the top and bottom of its 

stroke. Due to agitation of ground and oxygenation of 
the mixture, or a combination of both, by adding a 

high volume of air during the brewing process, 
increased extraction results.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the patent entitled 
"COFFEE BREWER" of which Alan M. King is the inventor, 
Patent No. 4,632,023 which issued in December 30, 
1986. This invention relates in general to coffee or other 
beverage brewers, and in particular to an improvement 
in beverage brewing machines wherein the filter 
element can be repetitively used and can be removed 
from the brewing chamber so that the coffee grounds 
can be removed therefrom and then the filter element 
can be returned to the brewing chamber. The present invention is an improvement in beverage 
brewing machines such as disclosed in Patent No. 
3,565,641 which issued on February 23, 1971 wherein 
the inventor is Alan M. King and which discloses the 
features in the pre-characterising portion of each of 
claims 1 and 12. This patent discloses a 
beverage brewing vending machine for brewing a single 
cup of coffee or other beverage which has a brewing 
chamber which receives hot water and beverage 
material. The chamber has a floor through which gas 
and liquid can pass but is provided with a filter 
which prevents the beverage material from passing 
therethrough. The apparatus disclosed in Patent 
3,565,641 has a lower chamber which is of 
substantially the same cross-sectional size as the 
first chamber located below the first chamber in which 
a piston is mounted. The piston can be moved upwardly 
toward the first chamber which forces air through the 
floor of the first chamber into the first chamber so 
as to agitate and brew the hot water and beverage 
material mixture to produce the beverage. The piston 
then moves away from the floor of the top chamber and  
 
draws the beverage through the floor and filter and then 
dispenses it through a suitable spout. In the apparatus of 
Patent 3,565,641, the filter material is not reused but a 
supply of filter material is supplied to the brewing chamber 
for each individual cup of coffee and then is discarded. The present invention provides a beverage brewing 
machine comprising in combination, an upper brewing chamber 
adapted to receive hot water and a beverage material and 
having an open lower end, a lower chamber with an open upper 
end normally in registration and sealed with said open lower 
end, a filter mounted between said upper and lower chambers, 
said filter being normally clamped between said upper and 
lower chambers, a reciprocable piston mounted in said lower 
chamber for forcing air through said filter into said upper 
chamber and for withdrawing brewed beverage
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A beverage brewing machine comprising in combination, 
   an upper brewing chamber (11) adapted to receive hot 

water and a beverage material and having an open lower end, 
   a lower chamber (25) with an open upper end normally in 

registration and sealed with said open lower end, 
   a filter (36;36a) mounted between said upper (11) and 

lower (25) chambers, said filter (36;36a) being normally 
clamped between said upper (11) and lower (25) chambers, 

   a reciprocable piston (26) mounted in said lower 
chamber (25) for forcing air through said filter (36;36a) 

into said upper chamber (11) and for withdrawing brewed 
beverage through said filter (36;36a), 

   a means for separating and sealing said upper (11) and 
lower (25) chambers so as to unclamp said filter (36;36a); 

   characterized in that in that the beverage brewing 
machine further comprises, 

   a hold-down means (20) mounted within the upper (11) 
brewing chamber movable between a first position wherein the 

hold-down means (20) presses down on the filter (36;36a) at 
least when the piston forces air upwardly through said 

filter (36;36a) and a second position wherein the hold-down 
means (20) is released from the filter (30). 
A beverage brewing machine as defined in claim 1 
wherein the hold-down means (20) is in the form of a grid 

mounted in the upper chamber (11) for pivoting movement 
between the first and second positions. 
A beverage brewing machine as defined in claim 2 
wherein a motor (150) is coupled to the hold-down means (20) 

through a first cam (111) driven by said motor (150), a 
connecting rod (117) engageable with said cam (111) and 

reciprocated thereby, a first pivoted lever (122) movable by 
said connecting rod (117), a pivoted lever (52) connected to 

said hold-down grid (20) and engageable by said first lever 
 

(122) for pivoting the hold-down device (20) between said 
first position and said second position. 
A beverage brewing machine according to claim 1 wherein 
said piston (26) is driven by a connecting rod (37a) which 

has one end pivotally connected thereto, a crank arm (31) 
pivotally connected to the second end of said connecting rod 

(37a), a driving shaft (32) connected to said crank arm 
(31), and a driving means connected to said driving shaft 

(32) and a loose connection between said piston (26) and 
said driving shaft (32) such that said reciprocable piston 

(26) stays longer at the top and bottom of its stroke than 
it would if there were no loose connection between said 

piston (26) and said driving shaft (32). 
A beverage brewing machine according to claim 4 wherein 
said loose connection is between said second end of said 

connecting rod (37a) and said crank arm (31). 
A beverage brewing machine according to claim 4 wherein
