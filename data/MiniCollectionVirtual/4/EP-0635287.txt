<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a toe binding in according with Patent No. 396,337. In order to increase the freedom of mobility of the bearing part in this toe binding, provision is made, according to the invention, for the bearing part (20) to consist of an upper part element (20') and a lower part element (20''), which part elements (20', 20'') are connected to each other by positive fitting in the assembled position of use, the support surface (23) being provided at the front of the two part elements (20', 20''), and for the two angled levers (35) to be mounted on the lower part element (20'').

<CLAIMS>
A front clamp assembly (1) comprising a housing (2) 
adapted to be secured to a ski (50) and accommodating therein 

a release spring (40) acting on a pull rod (10) extending 
therethrough and connected to a release plate (13) acting on 

the shorter lever arms (36) of two crank levers (35) mounted 
in a bearing part (20) for swivelling about vertical axle 

pins (34) with their longer lever arms (37) acting as sole 
retainers for a ski boot (60), said bearing part (20) being 

provided with an opening for said pull rod (10) to extend 
therethrough, and having a forward abutment face at least on 

partial contact with a rear end wall (3) of said housing (2) 
joined to a substantially horizontal rearwards extending 

portion, said forward abutment face (23) of said bearing 
part (20) being formed with two vertically adjacent sections 

(23a,23b) the lower one of which encloses an obtuse angle 
(α) with the upper one, said rear end wall (3) of said housing 

(2) extending substantially vertical, and said upper 
section of said forward abutment face (23) being joined to 

a rearwards and downwards inclined surface, characterized in 
that said bearing part (20) consists of an upper bearing 

part element (20') and a lower bearing part element (20'') 
interconnected in locking engagement in the ready-for-use 

assembled state, said abutment face (23) being formed at the 
front end of both bearing part elements (20',20'') of said 

bearing part (20), and said two crank levers (35) being 
mounted on the lower bearing part element (20''). 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said lower bearing part element (20'') is made 

of a metal, for instance a stamped sheet metal element, that 
the upper bearing part element (20') is an injection-molded 

plastic element, and that the two elements (20',20'') are 
interconnected by said axle pins (34) of said two crank 

levers (35).  
 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said abutment face (23) of said bearing 

part (20) is composed of a vertical section (23f) on said 
lower element (20'') and a plurality of adjacent sections 

(23a,23b,23c) on said upper element (20') with respective 
tilt edges (23d,23e) extending therebetween. 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that on said upper element (20') 

said abutment face has joined there to on both said of the 
longitudinal center plane an arcuate bearing face (107) composed 

of an arc (29) joined to said first section (23a) and 
extending into a rearwards and downwards inclined surface 

(28) (fig. 3). 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that in said bearing part (20), said 

second section (23b) on said upper element (20') encloses an 
angle (β) with the vertical, which is maller than the angle 

(γ) enclosed between said inclined surface (28) of said arcuate 
bearing surface (107) and the horizontal (figs.1,3). 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that in the absence of vertical loads 

acting on said sole retainers (37) of said two crank levers 
(35), sais bearing part (20) abuts said end wall (3) of said 

housing (2) only with said vertical section (23f) of said 
lower bearing part element (20''). 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that in the presence of an inserted 

ski boot (60) and vertical load acting on said sole retainers 
(37) of the two crank levers (35), said bearing part 

(20) abuts said end wall (3) of the housing (2) with the 
first (lower) tilt edge (23d) of said upper element (20'). 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that in the case of a backward fall 

or a backward twist fall, said bearing part (20) tilts on 
said end wall (3) of the housing (2) about the first (lower) 

tilt edge (23d) of said upper element (20') to come to rest 
on the end wall (3) of the housing (2) with said rearwards 

inclined section (23b).  
 
A front clamp assembly according to any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that in the presence of an increased 

vertical load acting on said sole retainers (37) of the two 
crank levers (35), said bearing part (20) tilts further 

about the second (upper) tilt edge (23e) of said upper 
bearing part element (20'), and during this phase takes 

support on said end wall (3) of the housing with this tilt 
edge (23e) alone.
