<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new thermodynamically stable modification of (±)1-(4-carbazolyloxy)-3-[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)ethylamino]-2-propanole
(Carvedilol), pharmacologically
acceptable salts or optically active forms thereof, processes for the preparation,
and pharmaceutical compositions containing it.Carvedilol, having a melting point of 114-115°C. is a compound with excellent pharmacological
properties (Merck Index 1 1. Ed. No. 1882), known to be active in the treatment
of cardiac diseases. The preparation and its use in medicine is described in EP-B-0
004 920.Carvedilol has a chiral center and, as such, can exist either as individual stereoisomers or
in racemic form. Both the racemate and stereoisomers may be obtained according to
procedures well known in the art (EP-B-0127099).It has now been discovered that Carvedilol can be isolated in two different modifications
depending upon the method of preparation which are distinguishable by their infra-red
Raman and X-ray powder diffraction spectra, and their melting points. The two polymorphic
forms are monotropic and they are hereinafter designated as Form I and Form 
II. It is desirable to prepare a therapeutic agent consisting of an unique and defined
composition which has a high storage stability.The present invention provides a thermodynamically stable crystalline form of Carvedilol
substantially free of other physical forms having a melting point about 123-126°C, and an
infra-red spectrum with a sharp peak at 3451 cm-1, which is referred to hereinafter as
Form I.The invention also provides a process for producing this substantially pure Form I. In
another embodiment of this invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation
containing the substantially pure Form I of Carvedilol as an active ingredient.Finally, the present invention provides a method of using the new substantially pure form
to prevent and/or treat circulatory and cardiac diseases.Where reference is made in this application to Form I or Form II substantially free of
other physical forms, it preferably means that at least 90% by weight of Form I or Form
II is present in that modification.Form II is the modification of Carvedilol prepared and purified according to EP-B-0 004
920.Surprisingly it was now found that a new thermodynamically stable modification of
Carvedilol (Form 1) with a higher melting point is obtained when the process of manufacture
is slightly altered.The melting points of each Forms I respectively II depend upon their level of purity,
consequently Form
