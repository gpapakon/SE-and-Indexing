<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydrogenation catalyst for use in
the production of hydrogen peroxide, the catalyst mainly containing
noble metal, of which more than 50 % is palladium, to a
method for the preparation of the catalyst, and to a hydrogenation
process, based on the use of the catalyst, as part of a
hydrogen production process.In the production of hydrogen peroxide by the anthraquinone
process, hydrogenation, oxidation and extraction stages succeed
one another. Anthraquinone, or a derivative thereof, dissolved
in organic solvents is hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst
to the corresponding hydroquinone. The hydroquinone is
oxidized with oxygen, whereupon it regenerates to its prehydrogenation
form, and simultaneously hydrogen peroxide is
formed. The formed hydrogen peroxide is removed by aqueous
extraction. The anthraquinone is recycled to hydrogenation.The catalyst used in the hydrogenation is in the main palladium.
Palladium is used either as such or attached to various
supports. The most commonly known supports are aluminum oxide,
carbon, and silica gel. In supported catalysts the concentration
of Pd may vary between 0.1 % and 10 %.A Raney nickel catalyst has also been used in the preparation
of hydrogen peroxide. The palladium catalyst has reduced the
share of nickel catalyst in use.Although the amount of catalyst is not decreased in the chemical
reaction, the catalyst nevertheless loses part of its activity
in use. Spent catalyst which has lost its activity can
be reactivated by regeneration. In the regeneration of catalyst,
organic solvents, acids/bases, are used, followed by 
water treatments, vaporizations, and possibly drying and thermal
treatments.A catalyst can be in part reactivated a few times by the treatments
mentioned above. Finally, a stage is reached at which
regeneration is no longer useful. At that time the noble metal
is recovered from the catalyst and a new catalyst is prepared.Efforts have been made to increase, by various means, catalyst
activity and the retention time of the activity. To a silica
gel supported catalyst there have been added, in addition to
Pd, also zirconium, thorium, hafnium, cerium, titanium and
aluminum as an oxide, hydroxide or carbonate (EP patent 009802
and US patent 4 521 531).Alumina support has been impregnated with copper and silver
compounds in addition to palladium. The metals have been reduced
onto the support by a conventional method. The additive
metals improve the selectivity of the catalyst in the preparation
of hydrogen peroxide
