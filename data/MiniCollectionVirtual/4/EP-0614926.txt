<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polycarbonate having 
a repeating unit derived from a trihydric phenol compound 
having a benzotriazole structure, in the molecule and a process 
for producing the polycarbonate. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to a polycarbonate comprising a 
repeating unit derived from a trihydric phenol compound having 
a benzotriazole structure and a repeating unit derived from a 
dihydric phenol compound, wherein the content of the repeating 
unit derived from the trihydric phenol compound having the 
benzotriazole structure is from 0.1 to 90 mol% based on the 
mole of the total repeating units, and also to a process for 
producing the polycarbonate. The polycarbonate is obtained by reacting a trihydric 
phenol compound having a benzotriazole structure represented by 
the formula shown hereinafter and a dihydric phenol compound 
represented by the formula shown hereinafter with a carbonate 
precursor. The polycarbonate of the present invention is useful as 
a molding material and also as a material for forming a polymer 
alloy with other resin, and in particular, is a material useful 
in the field of requiring a weather resistance.  
 The greater part of polycarbonates industrially 
produced at present are a so-called bisphenol A-type 
polycarbonates produced using bisphenol A [2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane] 
as the raw material. A bisphenol A-type polycarbonate is a resin well-balanced 
in the points of the cost, the properties of the 
resin, the heat resistance, the mechanical resistance, etc., 
but recently with the increase of the uses of polycarbonates, 
polycarbonates having more excellent properties have been 
desired and polycarbonates having various structures have been 
developed as disclosed in, e.g., JP-A-63-108023 and JP-A-64-66236. 
The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined 
published Japanese patent application". Furthermore, polycarbonates having far more excellent 
properties, polycarbonates having specific properties, or polycarbonates 
showing a specific performance in relation to the 
fields of uses have been desired in markets. As a result of various investigation, it has been found 
that a polycarbonate having a specific benzotriazole structure 
in the structural unit is useful as various molding materials 
and a raw material for forming a polymer alloy with other 
resin. The present invention has been accomplished based on 
this finding.  
 Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to 
provide a polycarbonate having a
