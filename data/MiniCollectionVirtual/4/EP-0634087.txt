Electronic fluorescent lamp ballast for a gas discharge lamp (3), 
comprising a bridge rectifier (1) which is to be connected to the ac voltage 

network and a dc-ac converter (2) to be connected at the outlet side of this 
rectifier in order to supply the lamp with an ac voltage, in which an output 

connection (14) on the bridge rectifier (1) together with an input and an 
output connection on the dc-ac converter (2) are connected to a reference 

potential connection (6) within the circuit,
characterized in that
 
the reference potential connection (6) inside the circuit is connected in 

alternating current form to the protective earth (S) of the alternating 
current network. 
Electronic fluorescent lamp ballast for a gas discharge lamp (3), 
comprising a bridge rectifier (1) which is to be connected to the ac voltage 

network and a dc-ac converter (2) which is connected at the outlet side of 
this rectifier in order to supply the lamp with an ac voltage, in which an 

output connection (13) on the bridge rectifier (1) together with an input and an 
output connection on the dc-ac converter (2) are connected to a reference 

potential connection (6) within the circuit,
characterized in that
 
the internal reference potential connection (6) is connected in alternating 

current form to the phase connection (L) and/or the neutral conductor 
connection (N) or to one and/or both input connections (10, 12) on the bridge 

rectifier (1). 
Electronic fluorescent lamp ballast according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the alternating current-like connection takes the form of a capacitor (C7). 
Electronic fluorescent lamp ballast for a gas discharge lamp (3), 
comprising a bridge rectifier (1) which is to be connected to the ac voltage 

network and a dc-ac converter (2) which is connected at the outlet side of 
this rectifier in order to supply the lamp with an ac voltage, in which an  

 
output connection (13) on the bridge rectifier (1) together with an input and an 

output connection on the dc-ac converter (2) are connected to a reference 
potential connection (6) within the circuit, in which the other output 

connection on the bridge rectifier (1) is connected in alternating current 
form to the reference potential connection (6) inside the circuit,
characterized in that
 
the other output connection (14) on the bridge rectifier (1) is connected in 

alternating current form to the protective earth (S) of the ac network by 
means of a capacitor (C8). 
Electronic fluorescent lamp ballast for a gas discharge lamp (3), 
comprising a bridge rectifier (1) which is to be connected to the ac voltage
