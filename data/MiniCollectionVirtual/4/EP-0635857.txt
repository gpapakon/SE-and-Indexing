<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a power capacitor of impregnated type as well as the method of manufacturing such a capacitor. The power capacitor consists of at least one capacitive element (3) obtained by compact coiling of at least two metallised plastic films. The impregnation liquid is located only between the windings defined by the coiling of the films. The deposition of the impregnation liquid is carried out while monitoring the quantity of liquid deposited, and the capacitive elements, once their wiring is completed, are coated in a thermosetting resin (19).
