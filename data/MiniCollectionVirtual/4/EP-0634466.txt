<DESCRIPTION>
Hot melt adhesives are used commercially for a wide variety of 
applications. The major advantage of hot melt adhesive systems is the lack of 
a carrier fluid which eliminates the need for drying the adhesive film once it 
is applied to the substrate. This elimination of the drying step overcomes 
hazards associated with solvent usage and also allows for faster production line 
speeds and lower transportation costs. Depending on the desired use, the degree 
of tack of the hot melt adhesives may be varied over a wide range to produce 
adhesives varying from pressure sensitive to non-pressure sensitive in character. For various applications, it is also desired that some hot melt adhesives 
be hydrophilic, i.e., be water-soluble, water-sensitive or water-activated. 
Such 
hydrophilic adhesives find use, for example, in the construction of flushable 
disposable products including diapers and sanitary napkins where the high degree 
of tack which is needed during construction and use must be substantially 
decreased so as to prevent adhesion to porcelain and sewer pipes. Water 
activatible adhesives are used for remoistenable envelope seals and other 
labeling applications where subsequent repulpability is also beneficial. Water 
repulpable adhesives are particularly useful in applications involving bag 
sealing, case and carton sealing, bookbinding, roll wrapping and tissue 
plybonding. Hot melt adhesives have historically been based on petroleum derived 
polymers such as polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate, styrenic block copolymers 
and polypropylene. Water sensitive hot melts have also been prepared from vinyl 
pyrrolidone polymers including vinyl acetate/vinyl pyrrolidone copolymers. All 
these adhesive compositions are further tackified, plasticized and/or reinforced 
with a variety of resins, oils and/or waxes which are derived from both petroleum 
and naturally occurring feedstocks such as wood, gum and tall oil rosin and  
 
terpenes. These classic compositions suffer from the cyclical price cycles 
common to all oil derived materials and also are generally very resistant to 
degradation once the articles employing them are disposed of. The present invention stems from the growing movement away from the use of 
adhesives which contain large amounts of petroleum derived raw materials towards 
those compositions containing higher levels of raw materials derived from 
renewable, natural resources which demonstrate some level of degradation. It 
also stems from the growing need for hydrophilic hot melt
