<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image reading method 
and device thereof, and more particularly to a method and 
device thereof for reading the image of a document in a time-series 
in a facsimile device, image scanner, digital copier, 
electronic blackboard, and the like. In recent years, image reading devices commonly known as 
contact-type image sensors have generally been utilized in 
document readers such as facsimile devices, instead of the 
charge coupled device (CCD)-type image reader for which 
reducing optics are necessary. Since this image reading 
device is formed as a one-dimensional plurality of 
photoelectric energy converting elements made of a thin film 
semiconductor, such as amorphous silicon (a-Si) on a glass 
substrate, the image of a document can be read uniformly. A 
normal photodiode is used in the photoelectric energy 
converting element, but because of the extremely weak 
photocurrent generated in the photodiode, a charge storage 
method is widely employed in which this photocurrent is 
detected from the charge temporarily accumulated in the 
junction capacitance of the photodiode. Moreover, as a result 
of the number of photoelectric energy converting elements 
becoming extremely large, a matrix driver, which may have a 
smaller number of switching elements, is usually employed. For example, as shown in Figure 1, a prior art image 
reading device is constructed by fabricating a one-dimensional 
array of m by n photoelectric energy converting elements each 
comprising a photodiode 1 and a blocking diode 2 connected to 
this photodiode 1 in series and opposite polarity. These 
formed pairs of photodiodes 1 and blocking diodes 2 are 
divided every m diode pairs into n blocks, B₁, B₂,..., Bn. The 
anode terminals of the blocking diodes 2 in each block B₁, 
B₂,..., Bn are connected commonly via a respective buffer gate 
3 to the respective output terminal of a shift register 4. 
The anode terminals of the photodiodes 1 in the same relative 
positions in the respective blocks B₁, B₂..., Bn are connected  
 
together commonly via a respective current amplification 
circuit IV₁, IV₂,..., IVm to a respective integration circuit 
IN₁, IN₂,..., INm. Moreover, the integration circuits IN₁, 
IN₂,..., INm are connected to sample holding circuits SH₁, 
SH₂,..., SHm, a multiplexer circuit MPX and an amplification 
circuit 5, so that a signal processing circuit for time-integrating 
the electric currents I₁, I₂,..., Im flowing out 
from the photodiodes 1 is constructed by the current 
ampli
