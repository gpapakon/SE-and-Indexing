<ABSTRACT>
A device for secure mechanical coupling of a fastening device (1) on a cylindrical part in the form of a shaft, a tube or a peg (2). The fastening device (1) includes a channel (43, 31, 51) for the cylindrical part and a recess (42) with an inclined washer (3), which is kept inclined by spring force and is bearing on a contact point, preferably in the shape of a ball (9) in such a way that its central aperture (31), which is slightly bigger than the diameter of the cylindrical part, is kept locked even if the fastening device (1) is turned around the cylindrical part. The fastening device (1) is especially suited for fastening a prosthesis on to a prosthesis sleeve equipped with the cylindrical part in the form of a peg (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a device for fastening a prosthesis, for example artificial legs,
to a prosthesis sleeve which is attached to an amputated leg, wherein the prosthesis sleeve
is equipped with a smooth cylindrical peg and the device further comprises a fastener device
containing a cylindrical channel which can be threaded on to the peg and preventing
movement of the fastening device in the direction away from the peg even if the fastening
device is turned around the peg.It is known to use inclined, elastic or spring loaded thin
metal elements with holes slightly bigger than the tube or
35 rod which is locked in one direction by the metal element.
These are used for example as jacks, door closers, etc. In
these cases the metal element and the tube or rod are often
mutually guided in such a way that no relative turning can be
done. Because this would generally mean that the locking 
action of the inclined metal element will come to an end.
Therefore, before the present invention it
has not been possible to use this simple locking principle in
those cases where a secure locking has been neccessary also
in combination with a possibility of relative turning and
detaching of the metal element with its locking function from
the tube or rod. FR-A-2 522 743 discloses a fastening device including an inclined washer in a recess acting
on a tube making it possible for the fastening device and the tube to be turned around their
common axle. The device is mentioned to have different applications in industry, such as
firearms, automotive, sights on a stand etc.GB-A-103 610 discloses a fastening device for prostheses permitting a slight rotation
movement. The problems, which are solved by the
invention connected with the fastening device for prostheses,
are to obtain a safe fastening and simple detaching without
tools. Moreover, the fastening device has to allow a certain
turning movement and lock steplessly without backlash against
moving apart when loaded and with compression between
the prosthesis and the prosthesis sleeve. These and other problems
are solved with a fastening device according to the
claims. In the following the invention will be closer described
referring to the enclosed drawings, in which
Fig. 1 shows in perspective a fastening device according
to the invention and a peg not combined,Fig. 2 shows the fastening device with the peg brought
together in a view from above,Fig. 3 shows section A-A from the side in Fig. 2, andFig. 4 shows section B-B in Fig. 2.As appears from the drawings,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for fastening an artificial leg or another prosthesis on to a prosthesis sleeve,
wherein the prosthesis sleeve is equipped with a smooth cylindrical peg and the device

comprises a fastening device (1) containing a cylindrical channel (31,44) which can be
threaded on to the peg (2) and preventing movement of the fastening device in the direction

away from the peg (2) even if the fastening device (1) is turned around the peg (2),
characterized in

that the fastening device is designed with a recess having an inclined washer (3) received
therein and the fastening device further comprising a contact point (9) against which the

washer bears no matter in what direction the fastening device (1) is forced on the peg (2),
said contact point is in the form of a low friction sliding or rolling surface (9) which can

rotate or slide in a coutersink (47) in the fastening device (1) making it a low friction to
turning between the washer and the fastening device, at least one spring (7,8) acting

on the washer (3) to at one hand keep it inclined in such a way that its central aperture (31)
prevents movement of the fastening device in the direction away from the peg (2), and on

the other hand keep the washer in contact with the contact point (9), the contact points of
the at least one spring (7,8) towards the washer (3) is also in the form of a low friction

sliding or rolling surface.
A device according to claim 1,
characterized in

that two springs act on the washer (3) and the first spring (7) acts on the washer mainly
diametrically to the contact point (9) to keep the washer inclined and the second spring (8)

is arranged to act on the washer (3) between the contact point (9) and the center of the
washer (3) with a force bigger than that of the first spring.
A device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in

that the fastening device (1) is released by means of a releasing device (6) acting on the
washer (3) against the spring force so that its inclination decreases, and the releasing 

device (6) consists of a shaft (61) with a conical part (63) so arranged, that the conical part
(63) raises the washer (3) when the shaft (61) is displaced axially.
