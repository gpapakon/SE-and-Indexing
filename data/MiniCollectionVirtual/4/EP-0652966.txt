<ABSTRACT>
Methods for the recombinant expression and secretion of viral proteins are disclosed. The methods involve the use of compatible escorts to shuttle the proteins to the cell surface. In this way, egress of recombinantly produced proteins out of the cell is facilitated, resulting in increased yields and easier purification of the desired protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
recombinant production of proteins. More
particularly, the invention relates to methods for
facilitating egress of recombinantly produced proteins
from a host cell using escorts.A desirable method for the production of
proteins involves recombinant expression. However,
commercially useful quantities of proteins can be
difficult to obtain. This is particularly true with
viral glycoproteins where recombinant production does
not always mimic expression during viral infection.
Specifically, some viral proteins are expressed at the
cell surface during viral infection but are expressed
intracellularly in recombinant systems. Thus,
additional purification steps must be taken in order
to isolate the proteins. Additionally, the proteins
are susceptible to degradation by intracellular
enzymes prior to purification. Such intracellular
expression has been observed in herpesvirus systems
with respect to glycoprotein H (gH) expression
(Gompels and Minson, J. Virol. (1989) 63:4744-4755);
Spaete et al., Progress in Cytomegalovirus Research
(M.P. Landini, ed., 1991) pp. 133-136).Chaperones bind newly synthesized
polypeptides and appear to stabilize these
polypeptides until they are assembled into their
proper native structure or until they are transported
to another cellular compartment, i.e., for secretion. 
Sambrook and Gething, Nature (1989) 342:224-225.
Compels and Minson, supra, postulate that additional
virus gene products are required for transport of
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gH through the
endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi network to the cell
surface. Similarly, the existence of a viral function
which escorts cytomegalovirus (CMV) gH to the cell
surface was proposed in Spaete et al., supra.
However, CMV UL56, the homologue of herpesvirus
ICP18.5 which has been implicated in the egress of
viral glycoproteins to the cell surface (Pancake et
al., J. Virol. (1983) 47:568-585), failed to promote
movement of both truncated and full-length forms of
CMV gH to the cell surface.As with gH, cell lines transfected with the
gene encoding the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
type 1 envelope glycoprotein, gp 160, have also failed
to process or export the protein. Haffar et al., J.
Virol. (1990) 64:3100-3103, speculated that this was
due to the absence of other viral proteins during
recombinant production.A new HSV glycoprotein, gL, has now been
identified (Hutchinson et al., J. Virol. (1992)
66:2240-2250, and Hutchinson et al., Abstract, XVI

<CLAIMS>
A method for recombinantly producing an immunologically reactive truncated
cytomegalovirus glycoprotein H wherein from 10 to 34 amino acids are deleted

from the C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of cytomegalovirus
glycoprotein H, said method comprising (a) co-expressing in a host cell a first

gene encoding said truncated glycoprotein H with a second gene encoding
soluble fibroblast growth factor receptor or a contiguous sequence of amino

acids derived from a protein substantially homologous to the gene product of the
CMV UL115 ORF (for example, the amino acid sequence of Figure 7) able to

form complexes with a protein co-expressed therewith and escort the protein to
the cell surface for secretion, under conditions whereby said truncated

glycoprotein H is secreted from said host cell; and (b) recovering said secreted
glycoprotein H.
The method of claim 1, wherein about 23 amino acids are deleted from the
C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of cytomegalovirus glycoprotein H.
A complex comprising an immunologically reactive truncated human
cytomegalovirus glycoprotein H wherein from 10 to 34 amino acids are deleted

from the C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of cytomegalovirus
glycoprotein H and either a soluble fibroblast growth factor receptor or a

contiguous sequence of amino acids derived from a protein substantially
homologous to the gene product of the CMV UL115 ORF (for example, the

amino acid sequence of Figure 7) able to form complexes with a protein
co-expressed therewith and escort the protein to the cell surface for secretion.
The complex of claim 3, wherein about 23 amino acids are deleted from the
C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of cytomegalovirus glycoprotein H.
