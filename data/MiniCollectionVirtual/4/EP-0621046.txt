<ABSTRACT>
Method of measuring the effect of a dialysis or 
similar treatment whereby a fraction of the used dialysis 

fluid is extracted downstream of the dialyzer for analysis 
of at least one substance, i.e. urea, whereby said fraction 

of dialysis fluid is extracted via a branch conduit (8) 
containing a pump (6). 
The method according to the invention is 
characterized in that the total amount of used dialysis 

fluid is measured, in that the proportion and/or amount of 
said substance in the extracted fraction is measured and 

also in that the total amount of said substance removed 
from the patient is calculated with the help of these 

values. 
The invention is preferably intended for use in 
connection with haemodialysis, haemofiltration and 

haemodiafiltration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates of a method of measuring the 
effect of a dialysis or similar treatment, whereby a 
fraction of the used dialysis fluid is extracted downstream 
of the dialyzer for analysis of at least one substance, 
e.g. urea, whereby said fraction of said dialysis fluid is 
extracted via a branch conduit containing a pump. The invention is primarily intended for use in 
connection with haemodialysis, but can also be used for 
instance in haemofiltration and haemodiafiltration which 
can be said to be something between haemodialysis and 
haemofiltration i.e. a dialysis treatment with the help of 
a dialyzer having a permeability such that the patient 
needs to be supplied with a replacement fluid for the lost 
plasma water. It has become increasingly important and more usual 
to use some form of quantifying the dialysis which is 
administered to a patient. The most common way is by use of 
the method which goes under the name of "Urea Kinetic 
Modelling (UKM)". This method is based on a measurement of 
the level of urea in the blood before and after each 
treatment. These values are put into a theoretical model 
which describes how the level of urea is changed in the 
blood during dialysis. In this model it is assumed that the 
blood's degree of purity in the dialyzer is given by 
clearance K (including the remaining function of the 
kidneys) and that this leads to a similarly large  
 
concentration c of urea in the whole of its distribution 
volume V in the body. If one neglects the production of 
urea in the body and the change in fluid volume during 
dialysis, one arrives at a treatment time T of

Cafter = Cbefore * e-KT/V


 
The coefficient KT/V is normally used as a measure of the 
administered dose of dialysis and can, in the above model, 
be calculated from the concentrations of urea before and 
after dialysis. This model can be corrected for the 
production of urea by taking a measurement of the 
concentration at the start of the next dialysis and can 
then also give a measure of the urea production which is 
indirectly a measure of the patient protein intake. The assumptions which underlie the above model do 
not however always correspond with the reality of practical 
dialysis and result of the calculations performed is 
therefore not particularly reliable. Particular uncertainty 
occurs with high efficiency treatments, i.e. when using 
highly permeable membranes. This has thus produced a great 
debate concerning how one should measure and how one should 
calculate and use

Method of measuring the effect of a dialysis or 
similar treatment, whereby a fraction of the used dialysis 

fluid is extraced downstream of the dialyzer for analysis 
of at least one substance, e.g. urea, whereby said fraction 

of the dialysis fluid is extracted via a branch conduit (8) 
containing a pump (6), characterized in that the total 

amount of used dialysis fluid is measured, in that the 
proportion and/or amount of said substance in the extracted 

fraction is measured and also in that the total amount of

the help of these values. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said pump (6) is driven at a speed which produces a 

flow proportional to the flow in the main conduit (1) 
upstream of the branching point (7) and downstream of the 

dialyzer.

operated. 
Method according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that the flow in the branch conduit (8) is 

selected to be equal to one twentieth to on twenty-thousandth 
of the flow upstream of the branching point (7)

and one ten-thousandth and preferably about one 

five-thousandth of said flow.

following substances are measured in the extracted sample: 
urea, creatine , phosphate and beta-micro-globulin. 
Method according to any preceding claim,

automatically or manually, when it can be established that 
the first blood is approaching or has reached the dialyzer 

used, whereby there occurs a simultaneous start of the 
measurement of the total used amount of dialysis fluid, 

inclusive of the extracted ultrafiltrate. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the pump (6) is operated intermittently, whereby the 

number of sampling occurrences is selected to be at least 
ten, suitably over fifty and preferably considerably higher 

e.g. over a hundred. 
Method according to claim 7, characterized in

periods with a speed which gives a flow proportional to the

point (7) and downstream of the dialyzer. 
Method according to claim 7, characterized in

Method according to claim 1, characterized in

substance, e.g. sodium, potassium or sodium bi-carbonate is 

already present in the fluid supplied to the dialyzer, the 
amount and/or proportion of the same substance supplied to 

the dialyzer is also calculated with the help of known 
and/or entered dialysis parameters.
