<ABSTRACT>
A machine in which packages (7) are transporting over a series of 
conveyors to arrange them in suitable layers for stacking into loads for 

palletizing, each layer having a predetermined arrangement. Machine 
components perform functions of rotating packages in a horizontal plane, 

moving packages transversely and delivering packages in the 
predetermined pattern to form the layers. The packages are moved 

laterally by two vertical members (15,16) which clamp each package 
therebetween and can push or pull the package to a desired lateral position 

to create the predetermined pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
In many production operations it is customary to load the products of the 
operation usually upon pallets for transportation, sometimes by fork-lift 
trucks to final points of disposition to warehouses or other facilities. It has been the accepted practice to pile the items up by hand upon the 
pallets. The items are usually of rectangular cross-section such as boxes 
or cartons or sometimes loose bundles of items such as knocked-down flat 
corrugated paper cartons, as is common in that industry. This involves 
considerable labor cost and time factor and places a substantial burden on 
the efficiency of she overall operation of the business. US-A-4,311,425 is directed to this problem and is concerned primary with 
manual operations and does not teach any automation. DE-A-3839616, FR-A-2616135, FR-A-1444118 and DE-A-1239241 
disclose automated package stacking machines, having a pusher for 
pushing a package to laterally position the package on the conveyor of the 
machine. US-A-4067456 also discloses an automated package stacking 
machine, this machine having a series of chain conveyors that operate 
row-by-row to move a package in one direction to laterally position the 
package, thereby acting like a "pusher". Straight rows of packages can 
only be produced with this machine. None of these documents discloses 
means for pulling as well as pushing a package (or otherwise moving a 
package in opposite directions) to laterally position the package. In 
addition, the use of a pusher which cannot pull the package has 
disadvantages, because the package must be received at a limited number  
 
of locations, preferably close to the retracted position of the pusher in 
order to laterally position the package. The present invention overcomes these disadvantages by providing a 
machine as set out in claim 1. Claim 1 is based on DE-A-3839616 in its 
pre-characterising part, which is directed to a machine for positioning a 
number of individual packages into an arrangement of layers and forming 
a stack thereof, the machine comprising: 
   a plurality of power driven roller conveyors mounted in series on 
a supporting structure for successive transportation of said packages 
thereon as said packages flow from one conveyor to the next; 
   a vertically movable gate positioned on a first of said conveyors for 
controlling the flow of said packages on said first conveyor; 
   a rotator positioned on a second of said conveyors downstream of 
said first conveyor for rotating each of said packages horizontally about 
it
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A machine for positioning a number of individual packages (7) into 
an arrangement of layers and forming a stack thereof, the machine 

comprising:
 
   a plurality of power driven roller conveyors (11) mounted in series 

on a supporting structure (1) for successive transportation of said packages 
thereon as said packages flow from one conveyor to the next;
 
   a vertically movable gate (25) positioned on a first (2) of said 

conveyors for controlling the flow of said packages on said first conveyor 
(2);
 
   a rotator (B) positioned on a second (2a) of said conveyors 

downstream of said first conveyor (2) for rotating each of said packages 
horizontally about its central vertical axis;
 
   a lateral positioner (C) comprising a vertical member (15,16) for 

positioning each of said packages transversely to a predetermined lateral 
position;
 
   a stop (18) positioned downstream of said lateral positioner (C) to 

arrest flow of the packages that have been positioned at predetermined 
locations by said lateral positioner (C);
 
   means for forming a layer of packages;
 
   transferring means (D,G) mounted on said supporting structure 

downstream of said stop (18) for transferring successive layers of 
packages successively to a descending elevator platform (5);
 
   means (F-2) mounted on said supporting structure for depositing a 

sheet of paper (110) onto the platform (5); and
 
   means (E) for lowering said platform in successive steps to receive 

successive layers of packages to form a stack thereon;
 
   characterised in that said lateral positioner (C) is positioned on a 

third (3) of said conveyors for positioning each of said packages 
transversely across the third conveyor (3) and is a clamp comprising a  

 
first and a second vertical member (15,16), said second vertical 

member being positioned in opposite, parallel, spaced 
relation to said first vertical member (15,16) transversely on said third of 

said conveyors, said first vertical member being movable towards and 
away from the second vertical member (16) transversely across said third 

(3) of said conveyors, each of said vertical members (15,16) being 
mounted on a separate travel carriage (60,62,63), a sprocket mounted on 

each of said travel carriages (60,62,63), a chain (65) operatively engaging 
both of said sprockets, an electric motor (66) mounted on each of said 

travel carriages and operatively connected to each of said sprockets, means 
for operating said motors (66) simultaneously in either direction of 

rotation to rotate said sprockets together in either direction of rotation, 
whereby said vertical members (15,16) may be moved simultaneously in 

the same direction transversely across said third (3) of said conveyors, 
said vertical members (15,16) being positionable relative to the rotator (B) 

to clamp each of said packages (7) therebetween for positioning each 
package (7) to a predetermined lateral position on said third (3) of said 

conveyors, said stop (18) being positioned at the downstream end of a 
fourth conveyor (11a) which is downstream of said third conveyor and 

operable to arrest package flow to form a layer of packages on the fourth 
conveyor (11a) said transferring means (D,G) comprising transporting 

means (D) and depositing means (G), said transporting means (D) being 

positioned on said fourth conveyor (11a) for transporting said layer of 
packages to said depositing means (G) at an end of said fourth conveyor 

for depositing said layer onto said platform (5), said platform comprising 
a fifth conveyor (5), said means for depositing a sheet of paper (F-2) 

being operable to deposit a sheet of paper (110) onto successive layers as 
they are being deposited onto said platform (5), whereby successive layers 

in the stack are separated by a sheet of paper (110), the machine including 
means (22) for receiving said stack from said fifth conveyor (5) to a sixth 

conveyor (6) for final delivery.
