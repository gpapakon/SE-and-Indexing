<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I), wherein X is (Ia), or X is (Ib), the carboxy group being linked directly to the cyclopentyl ring in the case where X = (Ia), and their salts in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of glaucoma, for increasing the movement of (retinal)intra-ocular fluid, for the treatment of vasospastic constitutions of the eye and for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, and also to corresponding ophthalmic compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Treatment of glaucomaThe term glaucoma covers pathological symptoms of the eye that are attributable to elevated intra-ocular pressure. Obstruction of the movement of aqueous humour often causes an increase in intra-ocular pressure. Chronically increased intra-ocular pressure has a damaging effect on the optic nerve and the retina, which can result not only in a restricted field of vision but also in blindness.Accordingly, the search for active ingredients that are able significantly to reduce intra- ocular pressure is regarded as very important. U.S. Patent No. 5 036 048 describes angio- tensin-II antagonists as being suitable agents for the treatment of glaucoma.Extensive pharmacological studies have shown that the compounds of the formula(I), whereinX is (lb), the carboxy group being linked directly 

 to the cyclopentyl ring in the case where X = ( ■ and their salts are suitable to a surprising degree for reducing intra-ocuiar pressiire. This effect is achieved not only by the topical administration of the active ingredient but also by its systemic administration.The compounds of formula (I) and their salts were also found to have a surprisingly long duration of action when used in the treatment of male albino rats, in which intra-ocular 

hypertension had been produced, using the glucocorticoid model.The compounds of formula (I) or salts thereof are also distinguished by being extremely well tolerated by the eye, which can be demonstrated in a test model using rabbits' eyes. For that purpose, eye drops comprising the active ingredient in different concentrations are administered to the conjunctival sac of animals of the Himalaya type (pigmented), for example over a period of five days. Ophthalmological and ophthalmopathological examinations revealed no local or systemic intolerances.Another surprising effect is that the compounds of formula (I) and their salts have a vaso-relaxing effect on the eye, both when administered topically and when administered systemically, and can accordingly be used in the treatment of vasospastic constitutions of the eye.In addition, the compounds of formula (I) and their salts can be used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.The compounds of formula (I) and their salts are described in the European Patent Applic¬ ation having the publication number 443 983 as angiotensin-II antagonists, in particular specifically in Examples 16 [(S)-N-(l-carboxy-2-methylprop-l-yl)-N-pentanoyl-N-[2'- ( lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-amine] and 40 fN-(2-carboxy-2.2-tetra-

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. The use of a compound of formula (I)
(I), wherein
X is (lb), the carboxy group being linked directly to 


 the cyclopentyl ring in the case where X = (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of glaucoma, for increasing the movement of (retinal) intra-ocular fluid, for the treatment of vasospastic constitutions of the eye and for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
2. Th? use of the compound (S)-N-(l-carboxy-2-methylprop-l-yl)-N-pentanoyl-N-[2'- (11 . - razol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-amine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt theiv \ in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of glaucoma, for increasing the movement of (retinal) intra-ocular fluid, for the treatment of vasospastic constitutions of the eye and for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
3. The use of the compound N-(2-carboxy-2,2-tetramethylene-ethyl)-N-pentanoyl-N-[2'- (lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-ylmemyl]-amine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of glaucoma, for increasing the movement of (retinal) intra-ocular fluid, for the treatment of vasospastic constitutions of the eye and for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
4. An ophthalmic composition for the treatment of glaucoma, for increasing the movement of (retinal) intra-ocular fluid, for the treatment of vasospastic constitutions of the eye and for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of 


a compound of formula (I) according to claim 1 or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
5. A systemically adminisurable composition for the treatment of glaucoma, for increasing the movement of (retinal) intra-ocular fluid, for the treatment of vasospastic constitutions of the eye and for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) according to claim 1 or of a pharmaceut¬ ically acceptable salt thereof.
6. A method of treating hypertension, cardiac insufficiency and glaucoma, increasing the movement of (retinal) intra-ocular fluid, treating vasospastic constitutions of the eye and treating diabetic retinopathy, which method comprises administering to patients requiring such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) according to claim 1 or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
