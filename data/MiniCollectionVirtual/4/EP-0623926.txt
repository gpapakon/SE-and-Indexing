<ABSTRACT>
For the clock extraction from n digital signals read from each of n tracks 
(T
a.1
 to T
a.n
) there are provided n phase-locked loops (13.1 to 13.n). In order to 
compensate for speed variations in the speed of transport of the record carrier (20) there 

is provided an additional frequency control system (22, 19.1 to 19.n). This system 
derives a control signal which is a measure of the speed variations, which control signal 

is applied to the voltage-controlled oscillators (21.1 to 21.n) of all the phase-locked 
loops as a common control signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for reproducing n digital signals
from n adjacent tracks on a record carrier, which arrangement comprises
read means comprising n read heads, each having an output, for reading n information
signals from the n tracks and supplying said information signals to the outputs,n detection means having inputs coupled to the outputs of the n read heads, for
deriving n digital signals from the n information signals read from tracks and supplying
said digital signals to outputs,n phase-locked loops having inputs coupled to the n outputs of the read heads,
each phase-locked loop comprising a phase comparator having a first input coupled to
the input of the phase-locked loop, having a second input and having an output, a
voltage-controlled oscillator having an input coupled to the output of the phase
comparator and having an output for supplying a clock signal of a given frequency,
which output is coupled to the second input of the phase comparator. Such arrangements
are known, for example, in the form of magnetic-tape recorders of the SDAT type or
the DCC type.These recorders are capable of reading magnetic tapes on which digital
audio has been recorded in a plurality of longitudinal tracks. This enables music
reproduction of substantially CD quality to be achieved. The magnetic-tape recorder of
the DCC type has come onto the market recently and is intended as a new digital
cassette recorder standard to supersede the current Compact Cassette standard.For the consumer market it has also been envisaged to provide such an
apparatus for portable use and for use in car radios. This imposes additional
requirements on the immunity of such apparatus to mechanical vibrations and shocks, in
order to guarantee audio reproduction of substantially CD quality.It is an object of the invention to provide an arrangement having an
improved immunity to vibrations and shocks. An arrangement as defined in the opening paragraph, further comprising
a control signal generator for deriving from the n output signals of the phase
comparators a control signal which is a measure of the deviation of the relative speed of
transport of the record carrier with respect to the read means from the nominal relative
speed of transport of the record carrier with respect to the read means, and for
supplying said control signal to an output, and the arrangement further comprising
means for applying the control signal to the inputs of the n voltage-controlled
oscillators, the control signal generator comprising a
