<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement of the compression-spring support (df) for the compensation of constant forces, which compensation is achieved in that the compression-spring support (df) is mounted either such that it is fixed on the crank (a) and supported in the foundation on guide paths (FGB) or such that it is fixed in the foundation and supported on the crank (a) on guide paths (FGB), the arrangement being extended by kinematic reversal and multiple usage of circular compensation paths on compensation surfaces and/or on compensation areas, and it being possible to approximate the compensation paths by circular or elliptical paths or other paths which can be produced in a manner which is favourable from the point of view of manufacture.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the static equalisation of 
constant, directionally stable forces and/or at least 

quasi-static forces which are always monotonically 
variable in respect of magnitude and/or direction, 

having a crank arm which is pivotably mounted at a 
base point and with which pivot arm the force to be 

equalised co-operates, at least one compression spring 
support being associated with the crank arm to support 

this co-operating force, characterised in that the 
compression spring support (df) is rotatably mounted 

at the end of one side in a fixed point and is 
supported, in a freely displaceable manner, at the end 

of the opposite side in a guide path so that the 
normal of the guide path coincides, at each path 

supporting point, with the longitudinal axis of the 
compression spring support (df), and the displacement 

work which is to be applied or becomes free in respect 
of the force (G) to be equalised is releasable or 

storable as equivalent resilient energy. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the compression spring support (df) is 

rotatably mounted on the crank arm (a) and is  
 

supported in a freely displaceable manner on the guide 
path (FGD) associated with the base. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the compression spring support (df) is 

rotatably mounted on the base and is supported in a 
freely displaceable manner on the guide path (FGB) 

associated with the crank arm (a). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the guide path (FGD, 

FGB) has a convex configuration. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that raised portions (eh) 

and/or depressions (vt) are provided in the 
configuration of the guide paths (FGD and FGB 

respectively). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the guide paths (FGD and 

FGB respectively) can be moved closer through circular 
or elliptical paths or similar technically producible 

paths.
