<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material containing a new water-soluble 
binder, and more particularly to a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material wherein coating property 
has been improved. Generally, in a hydrophilic colloidal layer used in 
manufacturing a photographic light-sensitive material, gelatin 
which is solled and gels reversibly due to heating and 
chilling of its aqueous solution is used as a binder. 
However, when a high concentrated aqueous solution is coated 
aiming at high speed coating for the improvement of 
productivity, it had a shortcoming that coating unevenness due 
to drying air easily occurrs. In order to improve this 
problem, Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection  
 
(hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. 
Publication) No. 296736/1991 discloses a technology to 
incorporate natural high molecular poly sugars such as 
coppercaraguinane and W091/15526 discloses a technology to 
convert thermal transition temperature of gelatin by means of 
a derivative of an N-substituted acryleamide. However, these 
technologies are still not sufficient for attaining necessary 
properties. An object of the present invention is to improve the 
above-mentioned shortcoming which conventional water-soluble 
binders have, and more particularly to provide a silver halide 
photographic material wherein coating properties have been 
improved. An object of the invention have been attained by a silver 
halide photographic light-sensitive material comprising a 
support and provided thereon, at least one hydrophilic colloid 
layer containing a compound represented by the following 
Formula (I): 
wherein A represents a repeating unit represented by the 
following Formula (II);  wherein R₁ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 
1 to 6 carbon atoms, which may have a substituent selected 
from a halogen atom, an alkoxy group, an acyl group, a 
sulfoalkyl group, a nitro group, a nitrile group or a 
tetrahydrofurfuryl group; R₂ and R₃ independently represent a 
hydrogen atom or a substituent having an ether bond and 1 to 
20 carbon atoms or R₂ and R₃ may combine to form a ring, 
provided that R₂ and R₃ are not simultaneously hydrogen atoms; 
B represents a unit represented by the following Formula 
(III); 
wherein R₄ represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an 
alkyl group or -CH₂COOM; L₁ represents -CONH-, -NHCO-, -COO-, 
-OCO-, -SO-, -CO- or -O-; J₁ represents an alkylene group, an
