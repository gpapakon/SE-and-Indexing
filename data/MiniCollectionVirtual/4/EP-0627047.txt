<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel pressure regulators of the type used 
for regulating the pressure of fuel in the fuel rail of an internal combustion 
engine fuel injection system. Certain known fuel pressure regulators do not axially capture 
associated O-ring seals, and as a consequence, it is possible for the seals 
to become accidentally separated from the fuel pressure regulator when it 
is removed from its fuel rail. It is therefore preferable for the seals to be 
axially captured on a fuel pressure regulator so that they do not become 
accidentally separated, and certain other fuel pressure regulators are 
constructed to axially capture the associated O-rings seals so that the 
O-rings stay on the fuel pressure regulator when it is removed from its fuel 
rail. One known fuel pressure regulator that captures its O-rings 
comprises a multiple part housing, consisting of one stamping and two 
screw-machined parts, and requiring brazing and crimping operations in 
its manufacture. It has a brazed joint that must be completely leak-proof. 
To assure quality in a mass-production setting, the brazed joint of each 
valve must be pressure-tested, and because of the nature of the 
mass-production process, not all valves will be found to have completely 
leak-proof brazed joints. The use of a brazed joint, the necessity for 
pressure-testing it, and the improbability of obtaining a completely 
leak-proof brazed joint in every fuel pressure regulator makes that design 
relatively expensive. Moreover, that fuel pressure regulator does not 
integrate the filter screen because it uses a separate plastic filter element. Commonly assigned US Patent No. 5,076,320 discloses a fuel 
pressure regulator having captured O-ring seals and a filter screen. 
Another patent relating to a fuel pressure regulator is US Patent No. 
4,883,088. The latter has a plastic filter screen that is fitted onto the 
outside of the fuel pressure regulator.  
 The latter patent discloses a fuel pressure regulator comprising a 
housing divided into a fuel chamber and a control chamber by a movable 
wall which carries a valve element, a fuel inlet to said fuel chamber via 
which pressurized fuel enters said fuel chamber, a fuel outlet via which 
excess fuel exits said fuel chamber comprising a tube that presents a 
valve seat within said fuel chamber to said valve element and that passes 
from said fuel chamber through a wall of said housing, said control 
chamber comprising control means acting on said movable wall for urging 
said valve

<CLAIMS>
A fuel pressure regulator (10) comprising a housing (12) 
divided into a fuel chamber (14) and a control chamber (16) by a movable 

wall (18) which carries a valve element (28), a fuel inlet (42) to said fuel 
chamber via which pressurized fuel enters said fuel chamber, a fuel outlet 

via which excess fuel exits said fuel chamber comprising a tube (30) that 
presents a valve seat (40) within said fuel chamber to said valve element 

and that passes from said fuel chamber through a wall of said housing, 
said control chamber comprising control means (60) acting on said 

movable wall for urging said valve element toward said valve seat against 
the force exerted on said movable wall by pressurized fuel in said fuel 

chamber, said fuel inlet being disposed in said housing wall adjacent the 
passage of said tube through said housing wall, and said fuel pressure 

regulator further comprising a filter screen (34) for filtering particulate 
material from fuel disposed against the exterior of said housing wall in 

covering relation to said fuel inlet, and an annular member (32) disposed 
against said filter screen, said annular member and said housing 

cooperatively defining a groove which is disposed in circumferentially 
bounding relation to said inlet for retaining and axially capturing an O-ring 

seal (36) that is disposed therein to provide circumferential sealing of said 
housing to a pressurized fuel supply zone of a receptacle within which the 

fuel pressure regulator is intended to be disposed for use, characterized in 
that said filter screen is axially held between said annular member and 

said housing wall, said annular member has through-hole means (44) for 
exposing said inlet via said filter screen to such a pressurized fuel supply 

zone, and a retention means acts on said annular member and said 
housing wall to cause said annular member and said housing wall to hold 

said filter screen between them and to unite said annular member and 
said housing wall to said tube, said retention means comprising a 

shoulder (46) and a crimp (48) that are axially spaced apart on said tube. 
A fuel pressure regulator as set forth in claim 1 characterized 
further in that said shoulder is disposed to bear directly against one of said  

 
housing wall and annular member, and said crimp is disposed to bear 

directly against the other of said housing wall and annular member. 
A fuel pressure regulator as set forth in claim 2 characterized 
further in that said shoulder is disposed to bear directly against annular 

member and said crimp is disposed to bear directly against said housing 

wall. 
A fuel pressure regulator as set forth in claim 1 characterized 
further in that said groove comprises two axially spaced apart radial wall 

portions (50, 54) forming the sides of the groove and an axial wall portion 
(52) forming the bottom of the groove, and in which one (50) of said radial 

wall portions and said axial wall portion are in said housing, and the other 
(54) of said radial wall portions is in said annular member. 
A fuel pressure regulator as set forth in claim 4 characterized 
further in that said tube has an exterior portion disposed exteriorly of said 

housing, said exterior portion having a groove which is disposed in 
circumferentially bounding relation for retaining and axially capturing an 

O-ring seal (38) that is disposed therein to provide circumferential sealing 
of said tube to such a pressurized fuel supply zone. 
A fuel pressure regulator as set forth in claim 1 characterized 
further in that said filter screen is stainless steel. 
A fuel pressure regulator as set forth in claim 1 characterized 
further in that said fuel inlet comprises plural arcuate through-slots (42) 

arranged on a common circle about said tube, and said through-hole 
means of said annular member comprise plural arcuate through-slots (44) 

arranged on a common circle about said tube of the same diameter as the 
common circle on which the arcuate through-slots constituting said fuel 

inlet are disposed, and wherein the two sets of through-slots are relatively 
configured such that in any relative circumferential orientation of said 

annular member to said housing, at least a certain minimum overlapping 
area between them is assured.
