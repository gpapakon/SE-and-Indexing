<ABSTRACT>
A microstructure design for high IR sensitivity having a two level infrared bolometer microstructure, the lower level having a reflective metal film surface such as Pt, Au, or Al to reflect IR penetrating to that level, the upper level being separated from the lower level by an air gap of about 1-2 microns which allows the reflected IR to interfere with the incident IR and increase the sensitivity to a higher level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is in a high sensitivity two-level microstructure 
infrared bolometer array which can produce absorptance levels of greater than 80% and 
also achieve high IR sensitivity over a wavelength range from 8-14 x 10-6m (8-14 
microns). European Patent Specification Publication No. EP-A-0354369 discloses a 
bolometer structure having an upper detector place connected to a lower silicon 
substrate by metal inter connectors. The present invention provides microbridge infrared bolometer structure 
comprising a bolometer structure on a semiconductor substrate, said structure having a 
lower section on the surface of the substrate and a microbridge upper detector plane 
structure spaced from and immediately above the lower section; an infrared-reflective 
thin film metal coating on the surface of said lower section; said upper microbridge 
detector plane structure comprising a planar sandwich structure including a supporting 
dielectric thin film layer, and a thin film temperature responsive resistive element having 
first and second terminals; the structure characterised by downwardly extending 
dielectric leg portion means which are a downwardly extending continuation of said 
upper structure dielectric supporting said upper microbridge detector plane structure 
above said lower section so that a thermal isolation gap exists between said upper and 
lower sections; and electrically conductive paths included in said downwardly extending 
leg portion means connecting said first and second terminals to said lower section. Figures 1 and 2 are front and top views of a microstructure design 
according to the invention. Figure 3 is a graphical plot of overall absorptance vs. wavelength of the 
device over a selected wavelength including 8-14 x 10-6m (8-14 microns). Figure 4 shows graphically the transmittance, absorption and reflectance of 
the resistive layer. Figure 5 shows graphically absorption vs. air gap thickness. Figure 6 shows absorption of entire structure vs. metal absorber thickness. Figure 7 shows measured optical properties of Si3 N4. A cross section view of the two-level microbridge bolometer pixel 10 is 
shown in Figure 1. The device 10 has two levels, an elevated microbridge detector level 
11 and a lower level 12. The lower level has a flat surfaced semiconductor substrate 13,  
 
such as a single crystal silicon substrate. The surface 14 of the substrate has fabricated 
thereon conventional components of an integrated circuit 15 such as diodes, bus lines, 
connections and
