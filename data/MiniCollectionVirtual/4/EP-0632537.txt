<ABSTRACT>
A connector backshell assembly (70, 70') is 
provided for strain relief mounting to an electrical cable 

(62). The assembly includes a backshell (72) having 
forward and rearward ends (72a, 72b) and an axially 

extending cable-receiving aperture (82) therethrough. A 
toroidally configured, radially compressible strain relief 

coil spring (80) surrounds the cable and is disposed near 
the rearward end of the backshell. A compression nut (74, 

74') is engageable with the backshell for selective 
rotational and axial movement relative thereto. The 

compression nut includes a forwardly facing concave cam 
surface (74a, 92) for engaging and radially compressing the 

coil spring into strain relief engagement with the cable. 
An interference surface (84) is operatively associated with 

the backshell and non-rotatably engageable with the strain 
relief coil spring (80) to prevent rotation of the coil 

spring with the compression nut relative to the backshell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, more particularly, to a cable
connector which is provided with improved strain relief.
As disclosed herein, the invention is incorporated in a
backshell assembly, particularly a sealed backshell
assembly.Electrical cables, such as shielded cables, and
associated connectors frequently are used in military
applications and other industrial cable assembly
applications. In such applications, the connector/cable
interface often is environmentally sealed and should
provide a superior strain relief connection to ensure that
the quality of the electrical connection is not affected by
any physical abuse to which the connector and cable might
be subjected.Typically, an industrial-type connector found in
such a cable assembly is provided with a backshell and a
front connector combination which are mechanically
connected to one another. The backshell mechanically
supports and secures the cable for strain relief. The
backshell often may be provided with a plurality of
components for achieving shielding, sealing and/or strain
relief. In practice, there have been various types of
strain relief structures in the connector or backshell
assemblies, three types being most prevalent. The first
and most common type of strain relief is to provide a
conventional split shell screw-type clamp which is positioned 
over the connector and backshell after assembly and
then tightened by one or more screws to effect a gripping
strain relief about the cable. This type of strain relief
structure does not provide uniform stress throughout the
clamp, and uneven wear and ultimate insulation breakage
eventually may be caused at the stress points.A second type of strain relief structure is
embodied in a grommet compression-type backshell which
includes a rubber or other elastomeric grommet or sleeve
which is compressed onto the cable to provide strain relief
therefor. The grommet usually is provided primarily as a
seal for the connector, and the strain relief function is
secondary and, consequently, usually inadequate. In
addition, elastomeric rings do not provide uniform clamping
pressure throughout the entire circumference thereof when
subjected to considerable radial compressing forces.A third type of strain relief structure is shown
in U.S. Patent No. Re. 33,611 (and corresponding parent
U.S. Patent No. 4,857,015) to Michaels et al, dated June
11, 1991 and assigned to the assignee of this invention.
As disclosed therein, a coiled strain relief spring is
formed in

An electrical connector assembly (70, 70')
for strain relief mounting to a cable (62), the assembly

including first and second rotatably coupled members (72,
74/74') defining an axially extending cable-receiving

passage (82) therethrough, and a toroidally configured
radially compressible strain relief coil spring (80) for

surrounding the cable, the coil spring being sandwiched
between the first and second members and being radially

compressible into strain relief engagement with the cable
in response to relative rotation of the members,

characterised by interference means (84) on one of
said first and second members non-rotatably engageable with

the strain relief coil spring (80) to prevent rotation of
the coil spring with the other member relative to the one

member.
