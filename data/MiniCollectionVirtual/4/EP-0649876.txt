<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to copending application 
RD-23,112, US Serial No. 08/139,140 filed concurrently 
herewith. The present invention relates to a method 
for making polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane 
copolymers utilizing organic anhydride or carboxy 
functionalized polyarylene ether and organo amine 
functionalized organopolysiloxane. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to the application of 
vacuum-venting during the reactive coextrusion of 
functionalized polyarylene ether and functionalized 
organopolysiloxane. As shown by Shea et al., U.S. patent 
4,814,392, silicone-polyarylene ether block copolymers 
can be made by effecting reaction between amino 
terminated polydiorganosiloxane and anhydride 
functionalized polyarylene ether. As taught by Shea 
et al., the polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane 
copolymer can be made by a solution technique 
utilizing an inert organic solvent, such as 
chloroform, toluene or chlorobenzene under inert 
conditions. Although the polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane 
copolymers of Shea et al. are  
 
valuable thermoplastic high performance materials, 
Shea et al. utilize an organic solvent to facilitate 
reaction between the polyarylene ether component and 
the organopolysiloxane component. It would be 
desirable therefore to provide a method for making 
polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane copolymers 
without the employment of a volatile organic solvent 
to minimize environmental risks. The present invention is based on the 
discovery that improved copolymer synthesis can be 
obtained, if polyarylene ether-organopolysiloxane 
copolymers are made by employing vacuum-venting during 
the reactive coextrusion of functionalized polyarylene 
ether and functionalized organopolysiloxane 
Copolymer formation is favored, if the polyarylene 
ether is functionalized with anhydride or carboxy 
groups, and the organopolysiloxane is functionalized 
with organo amine groups. As used hereinafter the 
expression "functionalized polyarylene ether" or 
"Funct. PPE" means anhydride or carboxy containing 
polyarylene ether which has less than .02% by weight 
of reactive aryl OH and an I.V. of about 0.19 to 0.70 
dl/g in chloroform at 25Â°C. There is provided by the present invention, 
a method for making polyarylene etherorganopolysiloxane 
copolymers, comprising melt 
extruding while vacuum venting, a thermoplastic blend 
comprising by weight, 80% to 99.9% of polyarylene  
 
ether functionalized with a member selected from the 
group consisting of organo anhydride and
