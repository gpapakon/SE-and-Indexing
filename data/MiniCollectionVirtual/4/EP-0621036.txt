<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous agent comprising at least one arginine amide 
selected from the group consisting of (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N²-((RS)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl)-L-arginyl]
-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid, monohydrate thereof and 
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, and at least one 

compound selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrin and 
caffeine; a method for improving the solubility of arginine 

amide in water, comprising adding at least one compound selected 
from the group consisting of cyclodextrin and caffeine; and a 

method for stabilizing arginine amide in water, comprising 
adding caffeine. According to the present invention, the 

solubility of arginine amide in water can be enhanced to, for 
example, a concentration permitting inhibition of fibrin 

formation at the time of entoptic operation. In addition, the 
stability of arginine amide in water can be enhanced with less 

irritation of the eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous agent
containing at least one arginine amide selected from (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N2-((RS)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl)-L-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid,
monohydrate thereof and pharmacologically acceptable salts
thereof, which is useful as an active ingredient for inhibiting
formation of fibrin in, for example, an entoptic operation,
wherein the effective utility of arginine amide as a medicament
has been improved. More specifically, the present invention
relates to an aqueous composition wherein an arginine amide
shows an improved solubility and to an aqueous composition
wherein an arginine amide shows an improved stability.
Further, the present invention relates to a method for
improving the effective utility of arginine amide as a
medicament, particularly to a method for improving the
solubility of arginine amide and a method for improving the
stability thereof.Conventionally, steroid or indomethacin is administered
after an entoptic operation of cataract, corpus vitreum,
glaucoma or the like, for the reason that fibrin is formed with
considerable frequency to cause postoperative complications.
However, administration of said compounds for a few weeks after 
the operation has not shown dependable effects, but causes,
though not often, delay in healing of wounds or disorders in
cornea.Fibrin is formed from fibrinogen by the cleavage of
arginine-glycoside linkage of fibrinogen by thrombin. Since
the aforementioned arginine amide has a potent selective
antithrombin action (Japanese Patent Publication No.
48829/1986), the compound is expected to be useful as an eye
drop or entoptic perfusate to inhibit formation of fibrin in an
entoptic operation.Taking one of the aforementioned arginine amides, (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N2-((RS)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl)-L-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid
monohydrate (generally called argatroban) as an example, it is
used at a concentration of 1 mg/ml or above as an eye drop or
entoptic perfusate for the above-mentioned purpose. Said
argatroban has an extremely low solubility in water, showing
about 0.9 mg/ml of solubility at 25°C in the pH range (7.2-7.8)
preferable for the administration to local eye sites. Hence,
it is necessary to improve the solubility and, as a
consequence, the usefulness of argatroban as a medicament.
While an aqueous solution of argatroban can be preserved stably
in a brown bottle, an improved stability thereof will result in
a still greater utility of
