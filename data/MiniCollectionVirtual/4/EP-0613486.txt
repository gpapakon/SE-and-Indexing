<ABSTRACT>
The improved adhesion is provided by incorporating into an adhesive and/or sealant plastic material an effective amount of cyclodextrin or a complex of cyclodextrin and blowing agent. Where the complex of cyclodextrin and blowing agent is employed, an expandable mixture is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED ADHESIVES AND SEALANTSThis invention relates to adhesives and sealants and, more particularly, to a process for improving the adhesion of adhesives and sealants as well as an adhesive and sealant composition which displays improved adhesion. ^ The invention has been found to be especially useful for expanded adhesives and sealants which traditionally employed a blowing agent.Blowing agents, sometimes referred to as foaming agents, are substances that produce a cellular structure " in a fluidized plastic or rubber composition. Conventional blowing agents include fluorocarbons, nitrogen gas, hydrazine derivatives, trihydrazide triazine, 5-phenyl tetrazole, p-toluene sulfonyl εemicarbazide, modified azodicarbonamide, and azodicarbonamide. Chemical blowing ■ agents are a class of blowing agents which are solids or liquids at room temperature and, upon heating, release a gas. A well-known class of chemical blowing agents is sold under the trademark CELOGEN by Uniroyal, Inc. Blowing agents are used in making a variety of 0 consumer products and automotive sealants. Further, blowing agents are used with adhesive plastic materials in a hot melt adhesive. Blowing agents are also used in foodstuff wrapping which is applied to the exterior of animal parts after they have been butchered and prior 5 to wholesale. Such product is referred to by some as "bone wrap".Typically, chemical blowing agents are used by mixing the chemical blowing agent with a solid plastic material and then heating the admixture while maintaining 0 the mix under pressure. Heating fluidizes the plastic material and causes the blowing agents to release a gas. The gas forms bubbles or cells in the fluid plastic materia . 

 Chemical blowingagents have the advantage over gaseous blowing agents in that they can be added to the solid plastic material prior to heating. Gaseous blowing agents such as nitrogen and some fluorocarbons must be injected into the fluidized plastic material. With hot melt adhesives and sealants, a gas is mixed with the adhesive composition prior to the end of the nozzle.The use of fluorocarbons as blowing agents has come under close scrutiny due to its alleged affect on the earth's ozone layer. Other conventional blowing agents present problems with handling, toxicity, and flammability. Handling problems include storage stability, dust, and explosion hazards. It has now been discovered that the use of the cyclodextrin in sealants and adhesive compositions improves the adhesive quality of the sealant or adhesive

What is claimed is:
1. A method for increasing the adhesive nature of the material comprising: forming an admixture comprising an adhesive and/or sealant plastic material and an effective amount of a complex of cyclodextrin and a blowing agent; and heating said admixture so as to fluidize said plastic material and cause said blowing agent to expand said plastic material while said plastic material is in a fluidized state.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein prior to forming said admixture, a step of forming a complex between said blowing agent and said cyclodextrin is performed.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein said cyclodextrin is a beta cyclodextrin.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein said blowing agent is one or more components selected from the group consisting of water, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine and a peroxide.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein about 1 to about 30 parts by weight of said complex is admixed with said 


 plastic material based on 100 parts by weight of said plastic material.
6. A method for increasing the adhesive nature of an adhesive and/or sealant material comprising the steps of:
(a) adding to said adhesive and/or sealant material an effective amount of a cyclodextrin; and
(b) mxing said adhesive and/or sealant plastic 
'
 material and cyclodextrin to form an admixture with improved adhesion.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein said cyclodextrin is a beta cyclodextrin.
8. The method of claim 6 wherein the amount of said cyclodextrin added to said adhesive and/or sealant plastic material is about 1 to about 30 parts per 100 parts by weight of said plastic material.
9. The method of claim 6 wherein said adhesive plastic material is ethylene-vinyl acetate.
10. An adhesive and/or sealant composition with improved adhesion comprising an adhesive and/or sealant plastic material and an effective amount of a cyclodextrin. 


 11. The adhesive of claim 10 wherein the adhesive plastic material is a copolymer of ethylene-vinyl acetate.
12. The adhesive of claim 10 wherein said cyclodextrin is present in said adhesive in an amount between about
1 and about 30 parts per 100 parts by weight of said plastic material.
13. An adhesive and/or sealant composition with improved adhesion comprising an adhesive and/or sealant plastic material and an effective amount of a complex of cyclodextrin and blowing agent.
14. The adhesive and/or sealant composition of claim 13 wherein said complex is present in said composition in an amount of about 1 to about 30 parts per 100 parts by weight of said plastic material.
15. The adhesive of claim 10 wherein said blowing agent is present in said complex in an amount between about 1 and about 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of cyclodextrin.
