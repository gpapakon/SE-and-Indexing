<ABSTRACT>
Binding for fixing a sports shoe (1, 2) on a snowboard (3), which has at least one binding element (4) which engages at the front and at the rear and/or centrally and/or laterally on the sports shoe or is connected rigidly to the sports shoe (1, 2) by suitable means, the binding element (4) being supported via at least one elastically deformable element (5a; 15a; 25a; 35a) of low hardness arranged on the inner side of the shoe and at least one element (5b; 15b, 15c; 25b, 25d; 35b) of comparatively greater hardness arranged on the outer side of the shoe so that the binding element (4) can be tipped, in relation to the snowboard (3), about an axis (K) lying essentially in the longitudinal direction of the shoe, out of its rest position against a smaller restoring force in the direction of the inner side of the shoe than in the direction of the outer side of the shoe.
