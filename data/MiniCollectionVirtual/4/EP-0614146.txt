<ABSTRACT>
A data processor with speculative data transfer has address 
circuitry (40) and data circuitry (42, 44). The address circuitry 

generates a memory address associated with a data block and 
with a tag. The tag is representative of the validity of the data 

block. The data circuitry receives the data block associated with 
the memory address at a first time and receives a signal at a 

second subsequent time. The signal is representative of the 
validity of the data block. The data circuitry rejects the data 

block responsive to the signal. The data processor is able to 
receive data while the validity of the data is determined in 

parallel by, for instance, an address comparison or an error 
correcting code scheme.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to digital computing 
systems, and more specifically to a data processor having a 
speculative data transfer mode. In many data processor applications, the validity of data 
stored in a particular memory location is determined by an 
associated tag. Therefore, for a particular data access to be 
successful, the tag associated with the requested data must 
fulfill a predetermined criteria. External memory caches and 
error correcting code (hereafter simply "ECC") memory systems 
are two data storage mechanisms in which the validity of data is 
determined by such a criteria. An external memory cache is a relatively small, high speed 
memory system for supplying frequently used data to a data 
processor or other device. The data is periodically loaded from 
the data processing system's slower main memory into the 
external memory cache when time permits and as needed by the 
data processing system. The data is also periodically reloaded 
into the main memory from the external memory cache to free 
external cache memory locations for other data. An external memory cache is characterized by its location in 
a particular system. An external memory cache is not located on 
the same integrated circuit or "chip" as is the data processor or 
other device to which the external memory cache supplies its 
data. Conversely, an external memory cache is a cache system 
located on a data processing unit to which the cache supplies its 
data. The external memory cache, however, may be the only cache  
 
associated with a data processing system. An external memory 
cache does not require an internal memory cache system to 
operate successfully. Any cache is divided into a number of memory blocks and a 
corresponding number of "tags." Each memory block contains data 
that is useful to the operation of the data processor. Each tag is 
associated with one or a group of the memory blocks and contains 
data identifying the associated memory block or group of memory 
blocks. Typically the tag contains data representative of a 
portion of the main memory address from which the associated 
data block was loaded. Caches can store each data block in only 
one or a few particular cache storage elements. The storage 
elements are accessed through a subset of the main memory 
address bits of the data. The ability to have storage elements 
indexed by the same address bit subset is known as 
"associativity." For instance, in a four-way associative cache, 
each memory address may be mapped to four
