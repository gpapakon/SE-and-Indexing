<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the measurement of electrostatic potentials, and 
more particularly to an apparatus for reliably measuring an electrostatic potential. The present invention is a device capable of measuring electrostatic potentials with 
insignificant current flow into the input of the device. Generally, such devices include a probe or 
sensor assembly working in conjunction with an associated voltmeter assembly which receives the 
signals from the probe and produces an output signal. Subsequently, the output signal may be 
used to drive an indicator, or to control an electrostatic process as a function of the measured 
electrostatic potential. Thus, the features of the present invention may be used in the printing 
arts and, more particularly, in an electroreprographic system to control a xerographic process. 
These electrostatic voltmeters, or ESVs, are particularly well suited for measuring photoreceptor 
surface charge, which in turn allows for the automated adjustment of machine characteristics to 
achieve high quality reprographic output. Heretofore, it has been recognized that the sensing probe or electrode must be 
modulated, with respect to the field being measured in order to accurately measure the field. 
Moreover, two methods of achieving the required modulation of the electrode are known, the 
first requiring a stationary electrode and a vibrating element, or vane, to modulate the field 
which reaches the electrode. The second approach utilizes a moving electrode, affixed to the end 
of a vibrating element. Moreover, numerous approaches are recognized to process the signal produced by 
the sensing electrode, thereby enabling the measurement of the electrostatic field potential. US-A-3,667,036 to Seachman discloses electrometer amplifier circuits for measuring 
the potential of the electrostatic charge formed on an insulating surface. The circuit includes a 
probe assembly consisting of probe and guard electrodes. The output of the probe electrode is 
connected to a high impedance circuit which comprises a Metal Oxide Field Effect Transistor (MOS 
FET) in a source-follower configuration. US-A-4,061,983 to Suzuki discloses a transistor amplifier including a bipolar transistor 
supplied with an input signal and a field effect transistor (FET) which is directly connected to an 
output electrode of the bipolar transistor to amplify the applied signal. US-A-4,149,119 to Buchheit teaches an electrostatic voltmeter or electrometer which 
includes a probe sensor for sensing
