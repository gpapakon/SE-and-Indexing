<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an internal combustion engine (1) with cylinder banks (3, 4) arranged in a V-configuration and with inlet and exhaust valves (7) driven by a camshaft (6) by way of pushrods (25) and rocker arms, together with injection devices, comprising a cam-operated pump (8) and nozzle, with seating bores provided for the pumps in both cylinder banks, which bores form rows arranged in a V-configuration, are matched to the V-configuration of the cylinder banks and are formed on the longitudinal sides of the cylinder banks adjacent to the V-space, a camshaft being incorporated deep in the V-space in the cylinder housing as common drive shaft for the inlet and exhaust valves and pumps of both cylinder banks.

Water-cooled multicylinder internal-combustion engine with 
banks of cylinders arranged in a V-shape and having gas 

exchange valves operated by a camshaft via tappet rods and 
rocker arms, and with injection devices consisting of a 

cam-activated pump and nozzle, with mounting holes for the 
pumps associated with each cylinder bank forming V-shaped 

rows adapted to the V-shape of the cylinder banks, such 
that the mounting holes (17-24) are formed in the 

longitudinal sides of the cylinder banks (3, 4) that 
delimit the V-space and a camshaft (6) is integrated deep 

within the V-space in the cylinder block (2) to act as the 
joint drive-shaft for the gas exchange valves (7) and pumps 

(8) of the two cylinder banks (3, 4), and such that along 
a cross-sectional plane of the cylinder block (1) passing 

through each of the cylinders (9-16) and starting from the 
V-space of the cylinder banks (3, 4), the areas comprising 

the pump mounting holes, the valve tappet rod guides (26-41) 
and the cylinders (13-16) are aligned one after the 

other in a fan shape,
characterized in that
 
each cylinder bank has a respective longitudinal channel 

(42, 43) formed between the valve tappet rod guide and the 
pump mounting hole and serving as a water duct, and between 

the pump mounting holes opposite one another there is a 
further water duct (53). 
Internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the angle formed between respectively opposite mounting 

holes (17-24) in the two cylinder banks (3, 4) is smaller 
than the angle between respectively opposite valve tappet 

rod guides (26-41).  
 
Internal-combustion engine according to Claim 2,
characterized in that
 
the angle between respectively opposite mounting holes (17-24) 

is at most 70Â°. 
Internal-combustion engine according to any of the 
preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
each mounting hole (17-24) formed in the inward-facing 

longitudinal sides of the two cylinder banks (3, 4) 
comprises a recess-free pump support surface (17a-24a) for 

machining. 
Internal-combustion engine according to any of the 
preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
the cams (47, 48) associated with the pumps (8) of 

respectively opposite cylinders of the two cylinder banks 
(3, 4) are positioned between the cams (45, 46; 49, 50) for 

the gas exchange valves (7), such that beginning with an 
outermost cam (45) the subsequent cams (46-50) are 

associated in alternation with one cylinder bank and then 
the other. 
Internal-combustion engine according to any of the 
preceding Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
the cams (45, 46; 49, 50) associated with the gas exchange 

valves (7) of respectively opposite cylinders of the two 
cylinder banks (3, 4) are positioned between the cams (48, 

47) for the pumps (8), such that beginning with an 
outermost pump cam (47) the subsequent cams are associated 

in alternation with one cylinder bank (3) and then the 
other cylinder bank (4).
