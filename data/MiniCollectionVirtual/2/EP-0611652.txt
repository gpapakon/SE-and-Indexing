<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cleaning device for a printing machine for cleaning the surface of cylindrical bodies. The intention of the invention is to control the transporting of the cleaning cloth and the required tension in a cleaning device using few components. This is achieved in that a fresh-cloth roller 2, a cleaning roller 5 and a dirty-cloth roller 6 are arranged in a cleaning device. A cleaning cloth 4 is transported from the fresh-cloth roller 2 via the cleaning roller 5 to the dirty-cloth roller 6. A spring band freewheel 3 is arranged non-positively on the shaft 1 of the fresh-cloth roller 2. When the shaft 1 is rotated in the tensioning direction Z of the cleaning cloth 4, the spring band freewheel 3 runs freely and, in the opposite direction, it is blocked. By means of the spring-back effect of the spring band freewheel, the required cloth tension is guaranteed at the same time.

<CLAIMS>
Cleaning device on a printing press for cleaning the 
surface of cylindrical bodies by means of washing fluid 

and a washing cloth, consisting of a fresh-cloth roller, 
a dirty-cloth roller and preferably a washing roller, 

wherein the washing cloth is drawn off from the fresh-cloth 
roller by winding on to the dirty-cloth roller and 

pressed on to a cylindrical body via a throw-on device, 
characterised in that a spring-band freewheel (3) is 

concentrically arranged force-positively on a shaft (1) 
of the fresh-cloth roller (2), with one spring end (11) 

wound around the shaft (1) and with its other spring end 
(12) supported on a fixedly mounted frame part, so that 

the spring-band freewheel (3) free-wheels during the 
rotation of the shaft (1) in the direction of tension (Z) 

of the washing cloth (4) and locks in the opposite 
direction. 
Cleaning device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the spring-band freewheel (3) is a torsional leg 

spring. 
Cleaning device according to Claim 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the torsional leg spring forming 

the spring-band freewheel (3) is arranged at the end of 
the shaft (1) between the washing cloth (4) and a side 

part (8 or 9). 
Cleaning device according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the spring-band freewheel (3) has a 

circular or rectangular cross-section.
