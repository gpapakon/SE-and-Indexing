<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus for permitting the magnetization of flexible hard magnetic materials in the form of sheets or strips, such as magnetic rubber, wherein opposing arrays (10) formed from alternating magnetic disks and flux conducting elements are used in sets of two with opposing polar moments such as to induce a magnetic flux in the gap between the disks. A material to be magnetized is passed between the array sets (35) and consequently imprinted with magnetic poles. The magnetized properties of the material is enhanced by passing the material through a second set (38) of arrays which are axially offset with respect to the first set of arrays. This enhances the residual induction of the sample and significantly improves the pull strength of the material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
and process for effecting a multipolar magnetization of a
material which is preferably a flexible magnetizable
material in the form of sheets or strips of the magnetic
rubber type. The invention further relates to a
magnetized material resulting from the process which has
enhanced magnetic pull strength.It is known to imprint magnetic poles of
alternating polarity on the surface of material by causing
the material to travel in the immediate vicinity of the
active portion of a magnetizing apparatus or in the air
gap of such an apparatus producing an adequate magnetic
field. The multipolar magnetization obtained on the
material can be of the traversing or symmetrical type,
which means that the two faces of the strip or of the
sheet exert a magnetic attraction or pull strength of
approximately the same value. On the other hand, it can
be of a non-traversing or biased type and, in this case,
one of the faces of the material exerts a biased or higher
magnetic pull strength than the other face. The weaker or
magnetically unbiased face may be advantageous for other
uses and is able to receive, for example, some decoration,
paint or an adhesive, or alternatively a sheet of mild
magnetic material.In order to magnetize a material, it is
necessary to apply an adequate magnetic field to it, the
intensity of which depends on the magnetic intrinsic
coercive force of the material (and the direction of which
depends on the field lines to be imprinted in this
material). Typically the intensity of the applied flux
field should be at least two times the intrinsic coercive
force Hci of the material, and more particularly should 
be three or more, the general rule being that a magnetic
field three times the value of the material Hci being
necessary to achieve saturation magnetization.In accordance with the prior art, magnetic
fields are produced by direct, optionally pulsed electric
currents by using, for example, electromagnets, coils
(solenoids) or the discharge of capacitors.These systems are essentially intended for
single face magnetization. Nevertheless, they are
expensive as they are complex, often fragile, subject to
heating up and are high energy consumers and can be
dangerous. They are limited in the number of poles per
cm and in possible active surfaces due to problems of
insulation of the conductors and the electromagnetic
stresses applied to them. Moreover, the production rates
are frequently limited to a strip speed of less than 3
m/min or about 10ft/min, and even
