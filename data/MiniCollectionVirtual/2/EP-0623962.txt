<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a power MOS field-effect transistor 
having a plurality of cells identically configured in a 
semiconductor substrate, each containing a source zone, a 
drain zone and a gate of polycrystalline silicon, whereby all 
cells are connected in parallel by connecting the source 
zones, the drain zones and the gates. Currently popular power MOS field-effect transistors are 
fabricated with gates of polycrystalline silicon, this being 
the case, because when using this material in the course of 
the fabrication process high accuracy can be achieved as 
regards the positioning of the gates with respect to the 
other function zones of the transistor. In addition, by using 
this material for the gates the capacitances on the edges of 
the gates are held small so that these capacitances have no 
significant effects on the switching speed of the transistor. 
Since the individual gates of current popular power MOS 
field-effect transistors are interconnected by a layer of 
polycrystalline material, drawbacks result as regards the 
switching behaviour of the transistor. Polycrystalline 
silicon has namely a relatively high specific resistance 
resulting in the gate resistance together with the gate 
capacitance forming an RC element which reduces the switching 
speed of the transistor. In particular transit time problems 
occur resulting in not all cells of the transistor switching 
at the same time. Instead, due to the delay introduced by the 
RC element and depending on their location on the 
semiconductor substrate the cells are switched forward or 
reverse in a staggered sequence when the switching signals 
are applied. What is wanted, however, is that the cells 
connected in parallel behave, at best, as though they were a  
 
single cell. This is only possible, however, when all cells 
assume each wanted switching status in unison. This problem 
of the delay in switching is particularly a nuisance when 
high switching speeds are involved. The object of the invention is based on configuring a power 
MOS field-effect transistor of the aforementioned kind so 
that it can also be employed at high switching speeds. According to the invention this object is achieved by 
interconnecting the gates of the cells by a conductive layer 
of metal. By interconnecting the gates metallically a control signal 
applied to the gate connection of the MOS field-effect 
transistor is applied to all gates of the cells forming the 
field-effect transistor practically without delay so that 
accordingly all cells
