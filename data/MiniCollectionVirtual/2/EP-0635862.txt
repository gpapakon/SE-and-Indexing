<ABSTRACT>
Electrodes of an electron gun are etched in an electrochemical bath. The 
electrodes to be etched serve as the anode in the bath. The side of the electrode to be 

etched which faces the cathode in the chemical bath, faces an electrode at a higher 
potential in the assembled electron gun.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a cathode ray tube 
comprising a electron gun having electrodes. Cathode ray tubes are used, inter alia, in television receivers, computer 
monitors and oscilloscopes. Cathode ray tubes of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph 
comprise an electron gun having electrodes. In the electron gun one or more electron 
beams are generated. In operation, electro-optical fields are generated by means of 
electrodes having apertures for allowing passage of the electron beam(s). The electron 
beams are accelerated and focused by means of said fields. High voltages (above 
approximately 10 kV) voltages are applied to some electrodes. In particular in cathode 
ray tubes having a high picture quality, for example so-called HDTV display tubes or 
display tubes for High-Res (high resolution) computer monitors there is a tendency to 
apply ever increasing voltages to the electrodes. Such high voltages cause a number of 
problems, hereinafter referred to as "high-voltage behaviour". Electron sparks may hop 
between electrodes, the so-called "flashover". Such sparks may damage the display 
tube, cause loose parts in the display tube and/or adversely affect the life of the display 
tube. Under certain conditions this phenomenon also leads to a disturbing ticking or 
crackling noise. It is also possible that electrons are emitted from an electrode, the so-called 
"blue glow". These electrons adversely affect the contrast of the image displayed 
on the display screen. This also causes leakage currents between the electrodes. In 
operation, these leakage currents cause fluctuations of the electronic voltage between the 
electrodes and hence fluctuations of the image displayed. It is an object of the invention to provide a method in which one or more 
of the above problems are reduced. To this end, the method in accordance with the invention is characterized 
in that at least one electrode of the electron gun is etched in an electrochemical bath, in 
such a manner that in the electrochemical etching process a voltage difference is applied 
between the electrode to be etched and a counterelectrode so that the electrode is at a  
 
positive voltage with respect to the counterelectrode and, preferably, the side of the 
electrode which, in the assembled electron gun, faces an electrode which is at a higher 
voltage during operation, faces the counterelectrode in the electrochemical bath. In the electrochemical bath, the electrode to be etched constitutes an 
anode (positive
