<ABSTRACT>
A padlock has a lock body (1) of substantially U-shaped 
form with spaced-apart branches (1a, 1b), a shackle (2) 

movable back and forth within the lock body (1) between a 
locked position and a released position and a key-operated 

lock mechanism (3) within the lock body (1) for locking the 
shackle (2) to the lock body (1) in its locked position where 

it is received in both branches (1a, 1b) of the lock body (1). 
One end of the shackle (2) extends completely through one of 

the branches (1b) of the lock body (1) to leave a projecting 
proximal end (2b), which carries a lever element (11) 

extending transversely with respect to the shackle (2) and 
providing a handle for turning the shackle (2) relative to the 

lock body (1). In the locked position the lever element (11) 
extends over one branch (1b) of the lock body so that a part 

of it covers the key channel (4) of the lock mechanism (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a padlock having a lock body of 
substantially U-shaped form with spaced-apart branches, a 
shackle movable back and forth within the lock body between 
a locked position and a released position and a key-operated 
lock mechanism within the lock body for locking the shackle 
to the lock body in its locked position where it is received 
in both branches of the lock body and has at least one end 
which extends completely through one of the branches of the 
lock body to leave a projecting proximal end. DE-A-2 810 756 
describes such a padlock in which the proximal end of the shackle 
has an enlarged head. An aim of the invention is to further improve a padlock 
of the above-mentioned kind and to make it more secure and 
more versatile in its operation. The aim of the invention can be achieved with the 
construction defined in claim 1. In an arrangement according 
to the invention, supported to said proximal end of the 
shackle is a lever element which extends transversely with 
respect to the shackle and is turnable relative to the lock 
body. With this arrangement the movements of the shackle need 
no be dependent on the operation of a spring, but can reliably 
be accomplished manually by making use of the lever element 
in most conditions of use. The lock mechanism is advantageously received in a key 
channel arranged to open on the same side of the lock body 
that the proximal end of the shackle projects from. In this 
way the lever element can be so formed and dimensioned, that 
when the shackle is in its locking position, the lever element 
can be extended over at least most of the whole of said same 
side of the lock body so that a part of the lever element 
covers the key channel of the lock mechanism to dustproof the 
padlock and form a compact entity. To facilitate attachment of the lever element with said 
proximal end of the shackle, the latter can be formed to  
 
comprise a support element, which in the locked position of 
the shackle extends somewhat beyond the lock body. The lever 
element is advantageously made with at least some part of 
plastics material and can be fastened to the said support 
element of the shackle by means of moulding that part of the 
lever element around the proximal end. The design of the lock body can be varied in many ways 
but desirably a bolt means, for locking the shackle in its 
locked position to the lock body, is located in a bore formed 
in that branch of the lock body which is remote from the lever 
element. Conveniently a further

<CLAIMS>
A padlock having a lock body (1) of substantially U-shaped 
form with spaced-apart branches (1a, 1b), a shackle (2) 

movable back and forth within the lock body (1) between a 
locked position and a released position and a key-operated 

lock mechanism (3) within the lock body (1) for locking the 
shackle (2) to the lock body (1) in its locked position where 

it is received in both branches (1a, 1b) of the lock body (1) 
and has at least one end which extends completely through one 

of the branches (1b) of the lock body (1) to leave a 
projecting proximal end (2b), 
characterised in that
 supported 
to said proximal end (2b) of the shackle (2) is a lever 

element (11) which extends transversely with respect to the 
shackle (2) and is turnable relative to the lock body (1). 
A padlock according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
the key channel (4) of the lock mechanism (3) opens to the 

same side of the lock body (1) that the proximal end (2b) of 
the shackle projects from and in that the lever element (11) 

is so formed and dimensioned that when the shackle (2) is in 
its locked position, the lever element (11) can be placed 

against the lock body (1). 
A padlock according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 
the lever element (11) extends over the whole of said same 

side of the lock body in question, so that a part of it covers 
the key channel (4) of the lock mechanism (3). 
A padlock according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised 
in that
 said proximal end (2b) of the shackle (2) is formed 
to comprise a support element (12) which in the locked 

position of the shackle (2) extends somewhat beyond the lock 
body (1) and to which the lever element (11) is secured. 
A padlock according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 
the lever element (11) has at least a part made of plastics 

material and is fastened to the said support element (12) of  
 

the shackle (2) by means of moulding the part of the lever 
element (11) around the proximal end (2b). 
A padlock according to any one preceding claim, 

characterised in that
 a bolt means (7) for locking the shackle 
(2) in its locked position in the lock body (1) is located in 

a bore (9) formed in that branch (1a) of the lock body which
