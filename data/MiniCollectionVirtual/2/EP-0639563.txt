<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of glaucoma and ocular
hypertension. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of
fluprostenol isopropyl ester to treat glaucoma and ocutar hypertension.Cloprostenol and fluprostenol, both known compounds, are synthetic
analogues of PGF2α, a naturally-occurring F-series prostaglandin (PG). Structures
for PGF2α (I), cloprostenol (II), and fluprostenol (III), are shown below:
The chemical name for cloprostenol is 16-(3-chlorophenoxy)-17,18,19,20-tetranor
PGF2α. Monograph No. 2397 (page 375) of The Merck Index, 11th Edition
(1989) is incorporated herein by reference to the extent that it describes the
preparation and known pharmacological profiles of cloprostenol. Fluprostenol has
the chemical name 16-(3-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-17,18,19,20-tetranor PGF2α.
Monograph No. 4121 (pages 656-657) of The Merck Index11th Edition (1989) is
incorporated herein by reference to the extent that it describes the preparation and
known pharmacological profiles of fluprostenol. Cloprostenol and fluprostenol are
16-aryloxy PGs and, in addition to the substituted aromatic ring, differ from the
natural product, PGF2α in that an oxygen atom is embedded within the lower
(omega) chain. This oxygen interruption forms an ether functionality.Naturally-occurring prostaglandins are known to lower intraocular pressure
(IOP) after topical ocular instillation, but generally cause inflammation, as well as
surface irritation characterized by conjunctival hyperemia and edema. Many
synthetic prostaglandins have been observed to lower intraocular pressure, but
such compounds also produce the aforementioned side effects. Various methods
have been used in attempting to overcome the ocular side effects associated with
prostaglandins. Stjernschantz et al. (EP 364 417 A1) have synthesized derivatives
or analogues of naturally-occurring prostaglandins in order to design out selectively
the undesired side effects while maintaining the IOP-lowering effect. Others,
including Ueno et al. (EP 330 511 A2) and Wheeler (EP 435 682 A2) have tried
complexing prostaglandins with various cyclodextrins.The Stjernschantz et al. publication is of particular interest, as it
demonstrates that certain synthetically-modified PGF2α analogues retain the potent
IOP-lowering effect of the parent (PGF2α isopropyl ester) while decreasing the
degree of conjunctival hyperemia. In this publication, the only modification to the
PG structure is to the omega chain: the chain length is 4-13 carbon atoms
