<ABSTRACT>
A read-only memory ("ROM") utilizing junction field-effect transistors 
("JFETs") each having a conductive channel (107,108) orthogonally oriented with 

respect to the surface of the semiconductor material (101,102,104) composing the 
JFET. A fixed-position ion beam is employed to create this narrow gate channel, 

which extends between the JFET's source (104) and drain contact (e.g. 105). 
Employing such JFETs as basic memory sites within a semiconductor ROM circuit 

allows for an architecture that conforms to a minimum lattice structure layout. In 
addition, the resulting ROM offers high speed access of data. Although JFETs have 

not been utilized as the transistor of choice within ROMs because of their seemingly 
inferior performance when compared to MOSFETs, the invention provides a novel 

architecture which significantly enhances the practicality of the JFET as a memory 
device.

<DESCRIPTION>
Typically, large arrays of field-effect transistors ("FETs") fabricated on a 
single semiconductor chip are employed as read-only memories ("ROMs") for the storage 
of digital data. In general, metal-oxide FETS ("MOSFETs") have been the FET of choice 
for such ROMs because of the superior impedance characteristics which they exhibit. One 
well-known structure for achieving high storage density within a FET ROM requires the 
individual FETs to be fabricated so that they are connected in series. While this effectively 
reduces the area occupied by the FETs, it requires the use of an elaborate scheme to access 
and read the contents of the memory. Furthermore, the time required to access and read 
this type of series FET ROM is typically proportional to the square of the number of 
individual FETs connected in series. Obviously this results increasingly greater delays as 
memory size is increased. An alternative to the serial FET ROM architecture is a parallel arrangement 
comprised of multiple groupings of FETs. The FETs within each grouping are connected 
in a parallel to a single output called a bit line. The time required to access and read such 
ROMs is proportional to the number of FETs connected in parallel to each bit line. While 
this parallel architecture provides an improvement in access and read time over the serial 
architecture, it poses a problem with respect to maximizing the number of memory sites 
(i.e., individual transistors) which can be fabricated on a semiconductor chip of any given 
size. Ideally, it would be desirable to have a fabricated device (in this case, an 
individual FET) fit within the minimum period lattice structure of the particular 
semiconductor chip being produced. The minimum size of a feature that can be reliably 
fabricated upon a semiconductor chip is a function of the particular materials and 
processing techniques employed to produce that chip. Regardless of what the minimum 
feature size is, the minimum period of any regular square lattice structure that can be 
fabricated on a semiconductor chip is equal to approximately three times this minimum 
feature size. In other words, the most compact lattice structure that could be fabricated 
would consist of lines one minimum feature size wide, separated from each other by a 
distance equal to one minimum feature size. If one bit of information were stored at every 
intersection of this compact lattice, the highest possible data storage density for that 
particular technology would be achieved. Unfortunately, a
