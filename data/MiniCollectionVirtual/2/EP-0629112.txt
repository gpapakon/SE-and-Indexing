that the facing plate (11) is U shaped and surrounds the 

package and the lid. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the facing plate (19, 31) is fixedly joined to the 

package by fast fixing means (21, 32-33-36-37). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the fast fixing means are screws (2) whose number is 

substantially smaller than that of the springs. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the fast fixing means comprise a device with groove 

(33) and tongue (32), one of which is formed on the 
facing plate (31) and the other on the package (29). 
Device according to Claim 5 or 7, characterized 
in that the fast fixing means comprise a ring (37) made 

of a shape memory alloy applying a flexible part (35) of  
 

the facing plate against the package. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the lid (44) is made of a shape memory alloy, that 

the package (41) has an upper shoulder (42) that forms a 
projection into the package and that the lid is provided 

with springs (45) made of shape memory alloy on its lower 
face and is inserted in a curved state into the package, 

the springs taking support, in the expanded state, 
against a wall of the package (46).
