<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In paint spraying installations, the workpieces to be sprayed are transported through the spray booth (10) by means of a belt conveyor (12). As a result, the surface of the conveyor belt (13) is also provided with a paint or enamel application. However, it is necessary for the conveyor belt to be carefully cleaned after the removal of the workpieces. A paint spraying installation is to be further developed in such a way that the quantity of solvent required for the cleaning is substantially reduced. In addition, the doctor device for cleaning the surface of the conveyor belt (13) is to be readily accessible for maintenance work and is also to permit a quick paint change. 2.2 In the paint spraying installation according to the invention, the top strand of the conveyor belt (13) is deflected in the direction of the bottom strand by a deflection roller (16) mounted in the area of the discharge side of the spray booth (10). The top strand of the conveyor belt runs at an angle in this area. The doctor device is allocated to this sloping area. The doctor device essentially consists of at least one rotary doctor blade which can be driven in a rotational manner. The rotation axis of the rotary doctor blade (22) is perpendicular to the surface of the conveyor belt (13) to be cleaned. 2.3 The paint spraying installation according to the invention is especially suitable for spraying flat components such as, for example, parts of furniture.
