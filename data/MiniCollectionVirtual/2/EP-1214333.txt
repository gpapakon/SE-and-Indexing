<ABSTRACT>
The present application is directed to stabilize HIV envelope glycoprotein trimers. The trimers are stabilized by introducing trimeric motifs, preferably the GCN4 coiled coil or the fibritin trimeric domain, at certain sites, for example in the gp41 ectodomain. These stabilized trimers or DNA molecules encoding such trimers can be used to generate an immunogenic reaction. The trimers can also be used in assays to screen for molecules that interact with them - and to identify molecules that interact with specific sites.

<DESCRIPTION>
Stabilized Soluble Glycoprotein TrimersThe present invention was supported in part by NIH grants AI24755, AI31783, AI39420, and Center for AIDS Research Grant AI28691 and the U.S. Government has certain rights thereto.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) are the etiologic agents of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which results from the profound depletion of CD4-positive lymphocytes in infected individuals (Barre-Sinoussi, F., et al., Science 220:868-71 , 1983; Gallo, R. C, et al., Science 224: 500-3, 1984; Fauci, A. S., et al., Ann Intern Med 100: 92- 106, 1984).Though great progress has been made in the treatment of individuals infected with HIV, numerous problems still remain. For example, treatment typically requires taking different medicines at different times over extended periods of time. The failure to do so can result in seriously undermining the treatment, and ultimately result in further progression of the disease. Even where individuals follow the treatment protocol, there are reports of disease progression. Moreover, the treatment is extremely costly, effectively rendering it out of reach to many individuals in the United States, and in much of the rest of the world.Accordingly, the development of alternative methods of dealing with HIV infection is still extremely important.One area where a great deal of attention has been extended has been in utilizing viral sub-units to generate immune reactions. Antibodies that neutralize viruses typically do so by inhibiting viral binding to surface receptors. The major protein found on the surface of HIV, and therefore a major target for generating neutralizing antibodies, is the envelope 

glycoprotein, gp120. This protein appears on the viral surface of the virion, thus rendering it a prime target for the immune system.Unfortunately, the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins have proven inefficient in generating antibodies that neutralize the virus, especially those that can neutralize more than a limited number of HIV-1 strains (Berman, P. W., et al., J. Infect. Dis. 176: 384-97, 1997; Connor, R. I., et al., J. Virol. 72: 1552-76, 1998; Mascola, J. R., et al., J. Infect. Dis. 173: 340-8, 1996; reviewed in Burton, D. R. and D. C. Montefiori, AIDS 11 Suppl. A: S87-98, 1997; Burton, D. R. and J. P. Moore, Nature Med. 4(5 Suppl.) 495-8, 1998; and Wyatt, R. and J. Sodroski, Science 280: 1884-8, 1998). Many of the antibodies elicited by the envelope glycoproteins are not able to bind efficiently to the functional envelope
