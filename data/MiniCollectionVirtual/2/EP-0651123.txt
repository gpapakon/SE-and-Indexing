<ABSTRACT>
Attachment device for the connection of a drive unit to a shaft (1) for the initiation of an operating movement in a door leaf, preferably with the aid of cables which can be wound up on, and unwound from, cable drums (2), arranged in a rotationally fixed manner on the shaft, and which act on the door leaf with their end remote from the drum, having a driver part (8) which is arranged in a rotationally fixed manner on the shaft (1) and to which the output member (12) of the drive motor unit can be connected. In order to obtain a shaft, of the type mentioned, for the connection of different drive units with the lowest possible mounting outlay and space requirement at the operating location, the driver part (8) can be connected to different drive units via an adaptation part (24) or can be connected to the respectively selected drive unit (22) via an adapted output member.

<CLAIMS>
Door having a one-piece or sectional door leaf,
particularly a door which is movable with a vertical

component, preferably a sliding, rolling, one-piece or
sectional up-and-over door, which is operated by means

of cables which can be wound onto or unwound from cable
drums (2) non-rotationally mounted on a spindle (1),

optionally with a torsion spring device acting on the
spindle so as to compensate for the weight of the door,

and with a built-on device for the attachment of a drive
mechanism on the spindle (1) for imparting an operating

movement, whilst a carrier (8) is non-rotatably mounted
on the spindle (1) and in one of its end portions

outside the associated spindle bearing, characterised by
an assembly of different drive mechanisms (12, 13; 14;

22, 24), namely

a drive motor with a transmission gear connected
behind it, the output shaft of which is in geared

connection, via a pinion and a chain (13) engaging
therein, with a chain pinion engaging in said output

shaft - when limited lateral space is available -
a drive motor with a transmission gear connected
behind it having a housing, e.g. a chain housing (15),

on which an output power take-off member (18) is
mounted, - when moderate lateral space is available -

and
a drive motor with a transmission gear connected
behind it, the output power take-off member (23) of

which is connected to an adapter (24) - when more
lateral space is available -,

whilst one of these drive assemblies may be selected to
be connected to the carrier (8), particularly via a

flange connection, by means of the chain pinion (12),
the output power take-off member (18) or the adapter 

(24), all suitably constructed, whilst the cables are
connected to the door leaf by their ends remote from the

drum (2).
Door according to claim 1, characterised in that
the carrier (8) has a flange structure (11) to which the

chain pinion (12) may be attached directly and to which
the output power take-off member (18) and the adapter

(24) may be attached via a connecting portion (19) in
the form of a flange.
Door according to claim 2, characterised in that
the attachment to the carrier is effected by screwing

(21).
Door according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the shaft (1) is provided with a

longitudinal groove structure (5) running parallel to
the axial direction of the spindle, in the direction

from the outside of the spindle inwards towards the
spindle axis, in which a wedge formation (9) on the hub

of the carrier (8) engages.
Door according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the spindle (1) is constructed as

a tube.
Door according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the carrier (8) has at least one

radially movable screw (10) which acts on the spindle
(1) at least in order to secure the carrier (8) axially

in position.
Door according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the adapter (24) has a connecting

portion (19) for non-rotational attachment to the
carrier (8) and a connecting spindle (26) for non-rotational 

engagement in an output power take-off member
of a drive motor assembly (22), said power take-off

member being constructed as a hollow shaft.
Door according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the adapter (24) has a connecting

portion (19) for non-rotational connection to the
carrier (8) and a hollow shaft construction (27) for

non-rotationally accommodating a spindle end (23) of the
output power take-off member of the drive assembly (22).
