<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for stretch-forging ingots by means of a radial forging machine which is provided with, in particular, four radially arranged tools which act simultaneously on the forging. In the course of the stretch-forging operation, it is necessary to crop the ingot one or more times at its ends, i.e. to remove the relatively low-quality ends. This cropping must take place outside the line in which the radial forging machine, a manipulator or two manipulators arranged on either side of the forging machine and charging devices for feeding and removing and, if required, supporting and turning the ingots are assembled to form an installation, and it is therefore associated with a considerable loss of time and heat. The invention avoids this loss of time and heat by virtue of the fact that the forging installation is provided with a forging machine (1) with an integrated cropping shear (2). The integration of the forging machine and the cropping shear has a particularly space-saving effect and is thus particularly advantageous if, in accordance with a further feature of the invention, the forging machine (1) and the cropping shear (2) are provided with a frame (10) common to them both.
