<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cryogenic heat exchange system in which a
cryogenic heat transfer fluid is circulated through one or more passes of the
heat exchanger in order to cool a heat load. Additionally, the present
invention relates to a freeze dryer employing the cryogenic heat exchange
system wherein the cryogenic heat transfer fluid is circulated through a
condenser used in condensing sublimated water vapour (see for example
EP 0 301 117 A1).Cryogenic heat exchangers have the advantage that they do not use
environmentally damaging refrigerants, but instead use a cryogenic heat
transfer fluid such as a liquefied atmospheric gas. Additionally, such
cryogenic heat exchangers provide much greater flexibility in the amount of
cooling provided and can reach colder temperatures than heat exchangers
utilizing conventional refrigerants. It has been found, however, that it is
difficult to build such a heat exchanger in a compact fashion because as the
cryogenic heat transfer fluid enters the heat exchanger, more ice will build up
on the side of the heat exchanger at which the cryogenic heat transfer fluid
enters the heat exchanger. The section of the heat exchanger at which the
ice has built up will be relatively ineffective as compared to the remainder of
the heat exchanger. The ice itself may be unacceptable in come cases, such
as in chilling liquids, or may block the heat exchanger.Still another problem is that there is very little control over the temperature
of the heat exchanger. Assuming, liquid nitrogen were used as the cryogenic
heat transfer fluid, the inlet to the heat exchanger would cool to
temperatures of about 77Â°K. Such cooling would damage certain types of
food products and in any event would be inefficient when the article to be
cooled were only required to be cooled to about the freezing point of water.The present invention is concerned with the provision of a cryogenic heat
exchange system in which ice build-up on a heat exchanger employed in the
cryogenic heat exchange system is more uniform (and possibly prevented 
altogether) as compared with that of known heat exchangers which employ a
cryogenic heat exchange fluid. Moreover, the invention can generally provide
a cryogenic heat exchange system in which the temperature at which heat
transfer takes place can be controlled.In accordance with the invention, there is provided a cryogenic heat
exchange system comprising a cryogenic heat exchange system comprising:
a heat exchanger having at least one pass for receiving a cryogenic
heat
