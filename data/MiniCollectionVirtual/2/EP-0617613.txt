<ABSTRACT>
High strength, high porosity delivery devices have a shaped surface and disintegrate quickly in an aqueous medium. The devices can be prepared by disposing a formulation in a die to form a frozen predevice. A second die is contacted with the frozen formulation surface at a pressure and temperature for a time sufficient to locally momentarily liquify and shape the device surface. The shaping is followed by lyophilization.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to delivery devices, particularly pharmaceutical tablets, 
and methods for making thereof. Pharmaceutical tablets are often administered orally. A rapid disintegration 
of the tablet in the mouth without mastication or water facilitates administration to 
patients in general, and to the very young, the elderly, and to non-human animals, 
in particular. One type of oral dosage form which is designed to address the problem of 
swallowing is known as "chewable tablets". These tablets, however, are not fully 
satisfactory because they require mastication. Another type of oral dosage form known as the "effervescent tablet" 
comprises solid adjuvants of an acid and a base. The reaction between the acid 
and the base in the presence of water gives off carbon dioxide which "blows apart" 
the tablet to facilitate its dissolution. One type of effervescent tablet that must 
dissolve in a glass of water for administration requires that the patient drink the 
water. Aside from the problem of leaving a small amount of residual active agent 
in the glass, this dosing method is impractical for very young patients. Another 
type of effervescent tablet that "bubbles" and then dissolves in the mouth is also 
objectionable to some patient populations, especially the very young. Both types 
of effervescent tablets are thus not fully satisfactory. Yet another type of oral dosage form known as the "enteric tablet" is 
designed to release the pharmaceutical agent in the upper small intestine. A 
limitation of enteric tablets is that those that fail to disintegrate rapidly in the 
intestine could pass the "window of absorption" and result in poor bioavailability. One type of non-oral dosage form known as the birth control pessaries 
often takes as long as ten minutes to release the foaming agent. For obvious 
reasons, it is desirable for this type of dosage form to disintegrate rapidly. Tablets that disintegrate rapidly in an aqueous environment are often 
formulated with disintegration agents, such as starch, microcrystalline cellulose, 
carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and sodium starch glycolate, etc. These tablets 
disintegrate at an unsatisfactory rate for some applications described above.  
 An increased disintegration rate can be obtained by increasing the porosity 
(void spaces) of the tablet. Void spaces in the tablet matrix facilitate the 
permeation of water to rapidly erode the entire tablet. It is easily understood that a 
higher porosity of the tablet implies a faster disintegration in an
