<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the rotor of a turbogenerator having direct gas cooling of the field winding (1a,..), an insulating strip (6) is provided between the slot piece and the field winding conductor (1d) located above it. A resilient intermediate layer in the form of a corrugated spring (8) is provided between this insulating strip (6) and the said field winding conductor (1d) in order to compensate for seating phenomena of the field winding. This corrugated spring (8) extends in the direction of the rotor body centre, originating from the body end. In order to fix this corrugated spring axially without the cross-section of the base slot (9) being constricted, the corrugated spring has a pair of projections (20) which point downwards and engage in lateral cutouts (19) in the insulating strip (6).

<CLAIMS>
Rotor of a turbogenerator having direct gas 
cooling of the excitation winding (1), the excitation 

winding conductors being arranged in longitudinal slots 
(2) in the rotor body (3) of the rotor and these slots 

being closed by means of slot wedges (4), and an 
insulating strip (6) being provided between the slot 

base and the excitation winding conductor (1d) located 
above it, characterized in that a resiliently elastic 

intermediate layer (8) in the form of a parallel strip, 
preferably a corrugated spring, is provided between 

said insulating strip (6) and said excitation winding 
conductor (1d), which intermediate layer extends in the 

direction of the rotor body centre, originating from 
the body end, and in that the resiliently elastic 

intermediate layer (8) has a pair of projections (20) 
which point downwards and engage in lateral recesses 

(19) in the insulating strip (6). 
Rotor according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the projections (20) are formed by bending an edge 

piece which is short in comparison to the overall 
length of the resiliently elastic intermediate layer. 
Rotor according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the radial height of the projection (20) which 

points downwards corresponds approximately to the 

thickness of the insulating strip (6). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that, in the case of a rotor having a 

keyway (9), the width of the insulating strip (6) in 
the region of the recess (19) corresponds approximately 

to the slot width of the keyway (9). 
Rotor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a binding (22) is provided in the 

region of the recess (19), which binding is looped 
around the insulating strip (6) and the resiliently 

elastic intermediate layer (8).
