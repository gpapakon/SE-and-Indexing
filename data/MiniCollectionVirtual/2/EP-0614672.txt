<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biocompatible medical 
devices such as sutures and the like which also may be 
absorbable and to methods of making them. The advantages of absorbable materials in surgical 
applications are universally appreciated. The traditional 
naturally derived suture, known as "catgut," is formed from 
collagenous material obtained from sheep or beef intestine. 
More recently, synthetic absorbable sutures of varying 
chemical composition have been developed. A number of synthetic polymers have been described for 
use in making sutures and other bioresorbable medical 
devices. Effective synthetic absorbable sutures, as well as 
other medical devices such as haemostatic aids, intraosseous 
implants, slow-release drug delivery systems, and tissue 
regeneration devices including nerve channels, sperm ducts, 
vascular graphs, Fallopian tube ducts and the like, must 
satisfy a number of biological, physical and chemical 
requirements. Among these requirements are that the 
material be bioresorbable, non-carcinogenic, non-antigenic, 
and non-toxic. Further, satisfactory bioresorbable polymers for 
medical applications need to have appropriate mechanical 
properties including flexibility, tensile strength,  
 
dimensional stability, should be sterilizable and absorbable 
by living tissue at a uniform rate. With respect to 
sutures, flexibility, adequate straight tensile and knot 
strength and the capability of being properly and easily 
tied in surgical knots are particularly desirable 
characteristics. Various synthetic polymers have been proposed for use 
in the fabrication of sutures and other medical devices. Of 
particular interest are homopolymers and especially 
copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid. Such 
copolymers have been developed in an attempt to combine the 
characteristics of both compounds and extend the range of 
polymer properties and rates of hydrolysis. For example, 
poly-L-lactic acid is hydrolyzed more slowly than 
polyglycolic acid and copolymers of the two acids can be 
made to hydrolyze at intermediate rates. Polymers of this 
type, and their use in the preparation of synthetic 
absorbable sutures, are disclosed, for example, in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 2,703,316, 3,468,853, 3,565,869, 3,636,956, 
4,137,921, 4,744,365, 4,839,130 and 5,124,103. Improved 
braided sutures, which may be composed of lactic acid and 
glycolic acid copolymers, are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 
5,019,093 and 5,037,429. The use of lactic acid and glycolic acid copolymers in
