<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feces-sampling
transport container and, more particularly, to an easily
transportable feces-sampling container capable of
being sent and/or returned by means of mail such as by
packaging it in an envelope.The feces is suitable like urine as a noninvasive
examination sample so that it is broadly used as the
sample in several examinations.Of the aforementioned examinations, the detection
of occult blood in the feces is known as the screening
method of a digestive disease such as a discharge of
blood from a digestive tract and is very important for
diagnosis of a hemorrhagic disease such as an ulcer or
cancer of the digestive tract.In the method of detecting the occult blood in
the feces, the method (e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. 125064/1984) based upon the immunological reaction
principle, as recently reported, is superior in the
points of specificity and sensitivity to the conventional
detection method using the guaiac reagent and
is noted as a new screening method for the aforementioned
disease.Incidentally, in order to execute the method of
detecting the occult blood in the feces on the basis
of the immunological reaction principle, it is necessary
to sample the feces quantitatively in advance and
to suspend the sampled feces in a suitable liquid
thereby to prepare a predetermined feces suspension.This is because the immunological detection reagent
is preset to achieve a sensitivity according to
a specimen to be anticipated, i.e., the amount of the
feces, so that the sensitivity is lowered if the amount
of the feces to be examined is too small. On
the contrary, too much feces to be examined will cause
in conveniences for the transportation or mailing and
emit an offensive odor. Moreover, a problem will arise
when an excess of the specimen (i.e., the feces)
is to be disposed after the examination.In order to eliminate these difficulties, there
have been proposed in the prior art a variety of
feces-sampling transport containers. For example, 
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 69160/1987 has
disclosed a feces-sampling transport container which
is equipped with a sampling rod having a notched portion,
a recessed portion or a through hole in the
vicinity of its leading end.When the feces-sampling transport container disclosed
in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 69160/
1987 is used, a substantially constant amount of feces
sample is held in the notched portion, the recessed
portion or the through hole formed in the vicinity of
the leading end of the sampling
