<ABSTRACT>
A paper binding instrument including punching edges and 
auxiliary punching edges, in which the punching edges can make small 

holes 3 continuing from punched foot parts 1 of a small width and 
punched head parts of a large width formed at front ends of the head 

parts, and pushed down head pieces 6 which were the head parts 2 
through the sheaf of papers with leaving punched pieces 4 

corresponding to the small holes 3 and maintaining base parts of foot 
pieces 5 corresponding to the foot parts 1, and the auxiliary 

punching edges can make auxiliary small holes 8 facing in different 
directions from the facing directions of the small holes 3 formed 

with the punching edges 7, and as holding auxiliary punched papers 
corresponding to the auxiliary small holes 8, the auxiliary punching 

edges push down the front end parts of the auxiliary small holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an instrument for binding a plurality
of paper sheets according to the preamble of claim 1.Such an instrument is known from EP-A-362 046, which a discloses
a punch and chisel, wherein the chisel is provided with a slot,
through which the end portion of a punched tongue is inserted by
a pivoting finger. Only one tongue is provided, the free end of
which is inserted into a slot in the paper sheet cut by the
chisel. Typical examples in this kind of paper binding instruments are
known as staplers which bind piled papers with metal staples. A novel
stapler has recently appeared which can bind papers without using
metal staples. This comprises punching edges 7 shown in Fig.8. A
sheaf of piled papers 23 is folded at the corners as seen in Fig.7,
and the punching edges 7 can make small holes 3 continuing from
punched foot parts 1 of small width and punched head parts 2 of large
width formed at front ends of the head parts, and pushes down head
pieces 6 which were the head parts 2 through the sheaf of papers with
holding punched pieces 4 corresponding to the small holes 3 while
maintaining base parts of foot pieces 5 corresponding to the foot
parts 1. If the punching edges 7 are, as shown in Fig.9, pushed
through the sheaf of the piled and folded papers 23, the small holes 3
are formed with leaving the punched pieces 4 as seen in Fig.7, and if
the foot parts 1 of the small holes 3 are engaged by the head pieces 6
of the punched papers 4 as if they are jaws thereof, the papers may be
bound. With respect to the stapler without using metal staples, the
sheaf of papers 23 are folded at the parts to be formed with the holes
3, resulting in a bad external appearance. However, if the sheaf of
papers are bound without folding, the punched papers 4 of the upper
layer slide along the foot parts of the small holes 3 as ilustrated
with an arrow in Fig.11. The present invention is to provide a new paper binding
instrument which does not need the folding of the parts to be bound.This object is achieved by the features in the characterizing
part of claim 1.The sheaf of papers are bound by catching the jaws of the head
pieces 6 of the punched papers 4 in the foot parts 1 of the small holes
3, and the papers are thereby prevented from sliding, so that the end
parts of the sheaf 23 of papers does not require folding. Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of an entire body of the binding
instrument;Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the lower end part of the
punching means and a receipt part therefor;Fig. 3 is a

<CLAIMS>
Instrument for binding a plurality of paper sheets (23),
said
 instrument comprising

a base plate (11),
a template (22) mounted on said base plate,
a punching holder (12), and
a punching die (14) reciprocatingly mounted on said punching
holder,
said punching die (14) including first and second punching
pieces (7, 10)

complementary to openings (20, 21) of said template (22),
wherein said first punching piece is shaped

to form punched paper pieces from said plurality of sheets,
each punched paper piece (4) having an elongated form that

remains attached to the paper sheet at one end,
characterized in that
the first and second punching pieces (7, 10) are
extending transverse to each other for forming transversely

extending first and second punched paper pieces (4,
9) from said plurality of paper sheets when said punching

die is moved downwards through said template,

wherein each first punched paper piece (4) has an elongated
narrow foot portion (5) that remains attached to the paper

sheet at one end of the foot portion and has a wider head
portion (6) at the opposite end of the foot portion, and

wherein said second punching piece (10) is shaped to form
second punched paper pieces (9) from said plurality of

sheets, each second punched paper piece (9) being substanially
rectangular-shaped and remaining attached to the

paper sheet at one side edge of the rectangle,
said first and second punched paper pieces (4, 9)
being punched by the first and second punching pieces through

the bottom surface of said plurality of paper sheets in
directions substantially transverse to each other.
Instrument for binding papers according to claim 1, wherein
said first punching piece (7) is in a shape of an arrow

with an elongated portion (18) which forms the narrow foot
portion and a triangular portion (19) that forms the wider

head portion.
Instrument for binding papers according to claim 1, wherein
said punching die comprises a plurality of said first and

second punching pieces (7, 10).
Instrument according to claim 1, wherein said punching
pieces (7, 10) comprise leading surfaces which are inclined

with respect to said template (22).
