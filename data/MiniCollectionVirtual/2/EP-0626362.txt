<ABSTRACT>
A purification process of pentafluoroethane from a 
crude pentafluoroethane containing chloropentafluoroethane as 

a by-product by extractive distillation using an extracting 
reagent having a standard boiling point of from -10°C to 100°C 

and being selected from paraffinic hydrocarbons, alcohols, 
ethers, esters, and ketones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a purification process 
of pentafluoroethane, and more specifically to a purification 
process of pentafluoroethane by an extractive distillation 
method using an extracting reagent. Monochlorodifluoromethane (hereinafter referred to as 
HCFC-22) which has hitherto been widely used as a refrigerant 
for an air conditioner, refrigerator, etc., becomes an 
object of the world-wide regulation as a material of destroying 
the ozone layer existing in the stratosphere, that is, as a 
regulated fluorinated hydrocarbon. Thus, pentafluoroethane 
(hereinafter referred to as HFC-125) having the similar 
properties as HCFC-22 has been watched with interest as one of 
substitutes for HCFC-22. Since HFC-125 is usually produced by reacting perchloroethane 
and hydrogen fluoride as raw materials, monochloropentafluoroethane 
(hereinafter referred to as CFC-115) is 
frequently contained in the product as a by-product. However, 
CFC-115 also is an object of the world-wide regulation as a 
controlled fluorinated hydrocarbon (CFC) and must be separated. As one of the methods of separating a fluid mixture into 
constituting components, a distillation method is the most 
general method. According to the inventors' investigations,  
 
however, the relative volatility of a little amount of CFC-115 
to HFC-125 is near 1, for example, the relative volatility is 
from 1.01 to 1.02, under the pressure of near 5 kg/cm² G, and 
hence it is very difficult to separate HFC-125 from CFC-115 by 
a simple distillation method. Under this circumstance, an extractive distillation 
method of performing a distillation by adding to a fluid 
mixture, as an extracting reagent, a compound having a 
different boiling point than the constituting components of the 
fluid mixture is applied. For example, U.S. Patent 5,082,329 
discloses a process of separating HFC-125 from a crude HFC-125 
containing CFC-115 by carrying out an extractive distillation 
using a controlled CFC as an extracting reagent. The 
extracting reagent is exemplified with 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane, 
etc. and the extracting reagent itself is a 
controlled CFC. An object of the present invention is, therefore, to 
provide a process of purifying HFC-125, without using such a 
controlled CFC as an extracting reagent, by extractive 
distillation of a crude HFC-125 to separate HFC-125 from by-product 
CFC-115. As a result of various investigations, it has been 
found that the above-described object can be achieved by 
extractive distillation of a
