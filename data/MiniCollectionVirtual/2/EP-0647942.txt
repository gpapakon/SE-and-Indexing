<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive adapted for mounting in an inverted position is 
illustrated and a method for its assembly is described. The disk drive has a base 

having opposite surfaces. Components of a head/disk assembly are attached to 
one surface of the base. A cover is attached by bosses to the one surface of the 

base at three points, in a position spaced from the base. A yieldable seal between 
the cover and the base completes the enclosure of the head/disk assembly. A 

printed circuit assembly is attached to the cover in a position on the cover 
substantially paralleling the base. Mounting points on the cover are adapted for 

attachment in a product, such as a personal computer, with the disk drive in an 
inverted position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to mounting systems 
for disk drives. More particularly, the present invention relates to hard mounting 
disk drive components in disk drives to achieve greater economy of manufacture 
and space utilization, and better drive and shock performance. The electronics industry is struggling to cope with the 
changing demands of the market. For example, consumers in the personal 
computer market are constantly demanding more powerful and more compact 
machines, but also want these machines for less money. Partially in response to 
consumer demands, there is an industry trend away from shock mount systems 
to hard mount systems for hard disk drives. Hard mount systems offer several advantages over shock 
mount systems in which generally the head disk assembly is attached to a 
mounting frame using relative thick elastomeric isolation components. Hard mount 
systems typically have simpler designs using fewer parts, and therefore are 
cheaper to manufacture. Also, disk drives utilizing hard mount systems are more 
space efficient, because sway space must be provided in shock mount systems 
to allow for the movement of head disk assemblies that are shock mounted. 
Another advantage of hard mount systems is that they provide better shock 
performance than the shock mount system. The elastomeric components and 
sway space used to isolate the disk drive from shocks can allow an initial shock 
to be amplified or to be translated into rotary movement. A hard mounted disk 
drive may receive a strong initial shock, but there will be no subsequent 
amplifications or rotary movement from the initial shock. While superior in some aspects to shock mount systems, 
existing hard mount systems also present certain problems for manufacturers. 
Typical existing hard mounted disk drives use a die cast aluminum base to which 
the disk drive components, such as the spindle and disk platters, as well as 
read/write head stack, are attached to form the head disk assembly. The base also 
has the mounting points with which the disk drive is attached to the computer. One of the problems that occurs when the hard mounted disk  
 
drive is installed is headshift caused by distortion of the base when the screws or 
other devices are tightened at the mounting points. This distortion causes a 
misalignment between the read/write head stack and data tracks on the disk 
platter surfaces. This misalignment is critical since the tolerances for operation of 
disk drives are very small there being presently
