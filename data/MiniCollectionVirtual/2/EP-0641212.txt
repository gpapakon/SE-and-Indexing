 DESCRIPTION^ METHOD AND REAGENT FOR INHIBITINGCANCER DEVELOPMENTBackground of the Invention This invention relates to methods for treating cancer, and in particular, growth of a transformed cell, and inhibition of progression to a transformed phenotype 5 in pre-neoplastic cells.Transformation is a cumulative process whereby normal control of cell growth and differentiation is interrupted, usually through the accumulation of mutations affecting the expression of genes that regulate cell10 growth and differentiation.Scanlon W091/18625, W091/18624, and W091/18913 describes a ribozyme effective to cleave oncogene RNA in the H-ras gene. This ribozyme is said to inhibit C-fos expression in response to cis-plantin or other stimuli. 15 Reddy, WO 92/00080 and U.S. Serial No. 07/544,199 (filed June 26, 1990) , describes use of ribozy es as therapeutic agents for leukemias, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by targeting specific junction regions of the bcr-abl fusion transcript. 20 Summary of the InventionThis invention concerns use of a ribozyme targeted to the P-glycoprotein (mdr-1 gene) or other cancer-related genes prior to and/or during administration of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. Inclusion of such25 a ribozyme increases the susceptibility of the transformed■*. cells to such agents.Applicant notes that relapse of disease caused*■•*• by cancerous cells after administration of chemotherapeutic agents is a major problem in obtaining30 lasting remissions in a clinic. In some neoplasias, relapse is caused by the expansion of a population of transformed cells resistant to the initial and subsequent 

forms of chemotherapy due to inappropriate expression of the mdr-1 gene, also called P-glycoprotei . Such expression is usually caused by selection of transformed cells that have amplified the mdr-1 gene and thus produce increased amounts of the mdr-1 gene product. Applicant describes treatment of and prevention of this condition by use of ribozymes targeted to the mRNA encoded by this gene.The mdr-1 gene encodes a 170 kDa integral membrane transport protein that confers resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents such as colchicine, doxorubicin, actinomycin D and vinblastine (reviewed in Gottesman and Pastan, 263 J. Biol. Chem. 12163, 1988) . The gene has been isolated from both human and rodent cells selected in vitro for resistance to such agents (Roninson et al., 309 Nature 626, 1984; and Roninson et al., 83 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 4538, 1986), and the entire 4.5-kb MDRl transcript encoding
