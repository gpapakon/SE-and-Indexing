<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray diffraction device, comprising a water-cooled X-ray tube which 
exhibits a line focus as well as, after rotation through 90°, a point focus. Contrary to 

customary X-ray tubes, the cooling water is not supplied 
via
 the housing (12) in which 
the X-ray tube is mounted, but the cooling water connections (52, 54) are provided 

directly on the X-ray tube at the same side of the tube where the high-voltage connector 
(16) is provided. As a result, rotation of the tube upon changing over from a line focus 

to a point focus is not hampered by cooling water connections inside the housing of the 
tube. An additional advantage of this method of supplying the cooling water resides in 

the fact that the tube base (56) can also be cooled 
via
 these ducts. The base would 
otherwise become inadmissibly hot due to the loss heat from the filament (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an X-ray diffraction device, comprising an X-ray
tube and a holder for accommodating the X-ray tube which comprises an anode which is
cooled by means of a cooling medium and which is situated in the vicinity of a first end
of the tube, which X-ray tube is adapted to produce a line-shaped X-ray focus, said
device comprising conduit means for supplying and discharging the cooling medium.Such X-ray diffraction device is known from
SU-A-616 717.A device and a tube of the kind set forth are known from a leaflet
published by Applicant and entitled "High Power X-ray Diffraction Tubes". The leaflet
discloses an X-ray tube in which water is used as the cooling liquid for the anode. The
conduit means for the supply and discharging of the cooling water comprise a cooling
water inlet, denoted therein as "Water in" and a cooling water outlet which is denoted
therein as "Water out", a duct which conducts the cooling water along the anode to be
cooled being provided between said inlet and outlet. The inlet and the outlet are both
provided in a flange arranged on the tube at the area of an end which is situated in the
vicinity of the anode to be cooled. The X-ray tube is secured and positioned in the
holder by means of said flange. The cooling water is supplied and discharged via
openings in an abutment in the holder, which openings correspond to the inlet and the
outlet in the flange. In the X-ray tube shown in said publication a line-shaped X-ray
focus is formed wherefrom the radiation can be taken off in two mutually perpendicular
directions, i.e. in the longitudinal direction of the focus and in a direction perpendicular
thereto. For each of these directions an exit window is provided in the X-ray tube.For some X-ray diffraction applications it is desirable to expose the
specimen to be examined from a line-shaped focus, whereas for other applications a
point-shaped focus is to be preferred. Therefore, the X-ray tube preferably provides
both focus shapes. In the known X-ray tube this is possible by taking off the X-rays in 
the longitudinal direction of the focus line at a small angle relative to the anode surface; the
line focus is then seen as a (virtual) point focus. When the X-rays are taken off in a direction
perpendicular to said direction, the X-ray focus is seen to be line-shaped.In practice the
direction for the X-rays is prescribed, because this direction defines the location of the
specimen, the detectors and the other equipment of the analysis apparatus. The desired
