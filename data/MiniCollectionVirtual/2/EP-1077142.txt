<ABSTRACT>
A compact and light weight axle unit with good durability and reliability
for driving a vehicle wheel is provided wherein the splined bore 28 of the hub

6a is engaged with the splined shaft 30 of the drive shaft member 29, and a
stop ring 35 is held between the outer engagement groove 25 on the inner

peripheral surface of the splined bore 28 and the inner engagement groove 24
on the outer peripheral surface of the splined shaft 30 to prevent the splined

shaft 30 from being removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an axle unit as described in the preamble of claim 1.Various kinds of axle units have heretofore been used, in which an outer
ring and an inner ring are rotatably combined via rolling members in order to
rotatably support a wheel on a suspension unit. It is necessary for the axle unit
used for supporting the driven wheel on the independent suspension and
rotatably driving the driven wheel, to smoothly transmit the rotation of the
drive shaft to the wheel (while ensuring constant velocity); in combination 
with a constant velocity joint, regardless of relative displacement between the
differential gear and the driven wheel and the steering angle imparted to the
wheel. The axle unit for driving the vehicle wheel, which is a so-called fourth
generation hub unit, can be combined with such a constant velocity joint and
can be constructed relatively compact and lightweight. Such an axle unit has
heretofore been disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Tokukai Hei No. 7-317754,
or in US Patent No. 5,674,011.FIG. 36 shows one example of a conventional construction disclosed in
Japanese Patent Publication Tokukai Hei No. 7-317754. An outer ring 1
which does not rotate while being supported on the suspension unit when
incorporated into the vehicle, has an outward flange shaped attachment portion
2 for supporting the outer ring on the suspension unit, on the outer peripheral
face thereof, and two rows of outer ring raceways 3 on the inner peripheral
face thereof.On the radially inner side of the outer ring 1, a hub 6 formed by
combining a first element 4 and a second element 5 is disposed. Of these, the
first element 4 is formed in a cylindrical form having an mount flange 7 for
supporting the wheel on one end side (on the left end side in FIG. 36), and an
inner ring raceway 8 on the other end side (on the right end side in FIG. 36).
The second element 5 has on one end side (the left end side in FIG. 36) a
cylindrical portion 9 for externally securing the first element 4, and on the
other end side (the right end side in FIG. 36) a housing 11 which is the outer 
ring of a constant velocity joint 10 of a Rzeppa type, with the inner ring
raceway 8 arranged on the outer peripheral face of the middle part thereof.By disposing a plurality of rolling members 12, respectively between the
outer ring raceways 3 and the inner ring raceways 8, the hub 6 is rotatably
supported on the inside of the outer ring 1.In a position where the inner peripheral face of the first element 4 and
the outer

having a second circumferential fitting surface (30)
provided at an end on the outer side of the vehicle body

and formed with a second spline for spline engagement with
the first spline of the inner ring (6a,50), and the

constant velocity joint further having a second engagement
portion (14),
an engagement member (35) adapted to be resiliently
deformed in a radial direction, and engaged with the first

engagement portion (13) of the bearing assembly and with
the second engagement portion (14) of the constant velocity

joint, so that the bearing assembly is connected to the
constant velocity joint through the engagement member (35)

in the axial direction,

   
characterised in that
 the axle unit further comprises: 

an outer cap seal (34) fitted on the inner ring
(6a,50) of the bearing for sealing the spline engagement on

the outer side of the vehicle body, and
an inner rubber seal (37) between the inner ring
(6a,50) of the bearing and the outer ring (11) of the

constant velocity joint for sealing the spline engagement
on the inner side of the vehicle body.
An axle unit for driving a vehicle wheel of claim 1,
wherein the engagement member (35) is a stop ring.
The axle unit for driving a vehicle wheel of claim 1,
wherein the spline engagement contains a lubricant agent

thereon.
