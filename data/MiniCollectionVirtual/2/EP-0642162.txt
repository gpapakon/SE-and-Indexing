<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor integrated circuit device (10), a 
clock signal wiring for transmitting a clock signal to 

flip-flops (6) is constituted from a plurality of trunk 
clock signal lines (1) connected to a clock driver (5) by way 

of equal length lines, and a plurality of clock signal 
branch lines (8) branching from the trunk clock signal 

lines. The flip-flops may be connected directly or 
indirectly via the clock signal branch lines (8) to the 

trunk clock signal lines (1). In this instance, one of a 
pair of terminal ends of each trunk clock signal line (1) 

is connected to the clock driver (5) while the other 
terminal end is set as an open end (2), and the 

transmission loss in the trunk clock signal line (1) is 
sufficiently small. Accordingly, as reflected waves of 

the input clock signal at both terminal ends are 
present in trunk clock signal line (1) and the voltage 

waveform in trunk clock signal line (1) presents a 
composite waveform of the incident wave and the 

reflected waves, the clock skew in the semiconductor 
integrated circuit device is suppressed to a very low 

level even where the semiconductor integrated circuit 
device is formed as a large scale integrated circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor 
integrated circuit device, and more particularly to a 
semiconductor integrated circuit device having a clock 
signal wiring construction for suppressing a clock 
skew. Fig. 1 is a plan view showing a conventional 
example of a clock signal wiring line structure of a 
semiconductor integrated circuit device. In the 
conventional semiconductor integrated circuit device 
40, flip-flops 43 and 44 in a clock synchronizing 
circuit are driven by a circuit having a tree structure 
constituted from parent clock driver 45 and child clock 
drivers 46 driven by parent clock driver 45. A clock 
signal applied to clock input terminal 47 is 
transmitted to flip-flops 43 and 44 after a delay time 
which is caused by self delay times of parent clock 
driver 45 and child clock drivers 46 as well as the 
wiring resistance and capacitance of clock signal 
wiring 48 and the clock input terminal capacitances of  
 
flip-flops 46. In the conventional semiconductor integrated 
circuit device, if the wiring layers or the wiring 
lengths of the paths from the clock drivers to the 
individual flip-flops are different from each other or 
there is some imbalance between the numbers of flip-flops 
driven by the individual child clock drivers, 
then the individual paths have different peculiar 
signal propagation times, which cause a clock signal 
transmission delay difference (hereinafter referred to 
as clock skew) between the paths. In recent years, since the scale of semiconductor 
integrated circuits has been and is increasing, it 
becomes difficult to lay the wiring in the same layer 
or to equalize the wiring lengths of individual paths 
from clock drivers to flip-flops. Further, as the 
refinement of the manufacturing process for 
semiconductor integrated circuit devices proceeds, also 
the increase of wiring resistances of paths of the 
devices makes one of causes of increase of the clock 
skew. As a result, the conventional semiconductor 
integrated circuit is disadvantageous in that, when the 
clock frequency is raised, a malfunction is caused by a 
timing error arising from the clock skew.  It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a semiconductor integrated circuit device 
having a clock signal wiring construction which can 
suppress the clock skew to a minimum value eliminating 
the disadvantage of the clock signal wiring 
construction of the conventional semiconductor 
integrated circuit device described above. In accordance with the present invention, there is
