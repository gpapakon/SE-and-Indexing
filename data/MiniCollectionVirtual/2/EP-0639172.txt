<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of
polyhydroxybenzophenones. More in particular, the invention
relates to a process for the preparation of polyhydroxybenzophenones
by treating benzoic acid or a derivative thereof
with a polyhydroxybenzene in the presence of a large pore
zeolite as a catalyst.Polyhydroxybenzophenones are known as useful intermediates
for many reactions. For example, 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone
is an intermediate in the preparation of 4-O-octyl-2-hydroxybenzophenone,
useful as UV absorbent. Many methods of
preparing these polyhydroxybenzenes are known.According to British patent specification 947,686,
polystyrene plastics are made stable to ultraviolet light by
addition of certain benzophenone derivatives. According to
this patent specification, benzophenone derivatives were
produced by reacting o-toluic acid and resorcinol
(1,3-benzenediol). However, HCl is used in this process, which
leads to an inferior product.Fries rearrangements [K.Fries and G.Finck, Chem.Ber., 41,
4271 (1908)] in which catalysts such as AlCl3, ZnCl2, HgCl2,
SnCl4 and FeCl3 are used, can also be useful in the preparation
of polyhydroxybenzophenones. The preparation of 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone
can be acccomplished with a good yield by the
metal chloride catalyzed reaction of resorcinol with benzotrichloride,
leading to the production of hydrochloric acid
(Chem.Abstr.87, 210102 (1977)).Fries rearrangements in which catalysts such as polymeric
perfluorinated sulfonic acid resin (Nafion-H) and ion-exchange
resin (Amberlyst-15) are used, have also been reported. The
Fries rearrangement of aryl benzoates in the presence of ion-exchange 
resin catalysts is known from, e.g. Chemical
Abstracts 104, 109139u, where reacting aryl benzoates in the
presence of Nafion-XR or Amberlire 200C, as a result of a Fries
rearrangement leads to the preparation of the corresponding
benzophenones.In Chem. Abstr. 107, 39399q (1987) a process for the
preparation of 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone from benzoic acid
and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene in the presence of Amberlyst-15 has
been disclosed.US-A-3,354,221 discloses a process for the preparation of
mono-hydroxybenzophenones through a Fries rearrangement
reaction using zeolitic catalysts.US-A-1,995,402 is directed to the preparation of aryl-ketones
and phenolesters. Examples 2 and 3 show processes for
the preparation of mono-hydroxybenzophenones using
hydrosilicates of alumina as a catalyst.Chemical Abstracts 111, 7061q, discloses the preparation
of polyhydroxybenzophenones by
