<ABSTRACT>
A low insertion force, low profile electrical connector employs the 
folded end (3a) of a planar flexible circuit (1) as the electrical connector plug (2) 

which is plugged into an electrical connector receptacle (12) having a printed 
circuit board (11) and printed circuit traces (11a, 11b) as a part of the electrical 

connector receptacle (12). Contact pads (5a1, 5b1) connected with flexible 
circuit traces (5a, 5b) on the electrical connector plug (2) engage contacts 

(11b1, 11a2) connected to the printed circuit traces (11a, 11b) in the electrical 
connector receptacle (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors and particularly to 
electrical connectors having a low insert force and a low profile. Numerous applications in electronics require electrical connectors 
that are very small. Such electrical connectors can be characterized by 
connections between printed circuit boards and flexible circuits. In disk drives, for 
example, sizes have been reduced dramatically in just a few years. Drives of 1.3 
form factor which are about 34 millimeters in thickness are currently available. In 
such a small disk drive application, the electrical interconnection system between 
the head/disk assembly (HDA) and the printed circuit board assembly (PCA) has 
become a difficult challenge. Such an interconnection requires connecting a planar 
flexible circuit to a printed circuit board. Existing circuit interconnection technology has proven to be 
inapplicable in these circumstances. Zero force connectors have a profile which is 
too high. The direct connection of the head/disk assembly flexible circuit to the 
printed circuit assembly employing soldering techniques, while feasible, is 
undesirable, since it inhibits rework. Pin connectors are also too large for many 
such applications because of the pin pitch.  
 US-A-5,040,997 relates to a flex circuit connector assembly 
and a method for manufacturing same. The flex circuit 10 
comprises a contact side 12 on which two rows of electrical 
contact pads 14 and 16 are provided. The contact pads 14 and 
16 are located on the flex circuit 10 such that they align 
and mate with contacts 24 disposed in a female socket 
portion 26 of an edge connector 28. The flex circuit 
comprises a male contact including a first and second row of 
contact pads in which at least one pad of said first row is 
interconnected to a pad in the second row and alignment 
holes for ensuring that said flex circuit is folded at a 
predetermined location between said rows to form said male 
contact portion at one end of the flex circuit. The edge 
connector 28 includes pins 34 for mounting it to a 
receptacle. US-A-4,902,236 relates to a flex circuit and cable assembly. 
The flex circuit 10 comprises an array of connection pads 26 
for each header 12 to be assembled to the flex circuit 10. 
The header 12 includes a molded plastic housing 28 having a 
plurality of through openings 30 arranged in two parallel 
rows on its forward end with receptacles contained within 
each opening and with respective tails T extending 
rearwardly of the housing 28. Each tail T
