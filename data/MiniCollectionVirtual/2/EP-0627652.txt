<ABSTRACT>
A system for recording information related to the 
camera exposure parameters of film image frames in a 

detachable memory module (40) attached to a 
film cartridge (30) loaded 

in the camera in non-volatile memory for subsequent read-out. 
The memory module is constructed of a disc-shaped 

module housing having an upper (43) and a lower (44) surface and a 
diameter generally corresponding to the diameter of an end 

of a film cartridge (30) to which it is releasably attached. A 
set of conductive arcuate segments (42₂-42₄) spaced apart and 

electrically isolated from one another in a circular band 
surrounding a centrally disposed conductive pad accessible 

through a separate upper surface of the module housing. An 
integrated circuit chip (60), including a non-volatile memory, 

attached to the lower surface of the printed circuit (45) or 
substrate has input and output terminals connected by a 

further printed circuit array to the conductive pad and the 
arcuate segments. The memory module is releasably adhered 

to the film cartridge end so that the conductive pad and 
arcuate segments (42₁-42₄) can make electrical 

contact with data 
recording and reading terminal pins of camera and film 

processing equipment. A cartridge receiving receptacle has 
a centrally disposed contact terminal pin positioned to bear 

against and make electrical contact with the centrally 
disposed conductive pad and further 

contact terminal pins (14₂-14₅) 
positioned circularly around the centrally disposed terminal 

to extend into the receptacle and bear against and make 
electrical contact with the respective conductive arcuate 

segments, so that at least one terminal pin is in contact 
with each conductive arcuate segment. Typically, two 

adjacent terminal pins may contact a single segment. The 
camera electronic operating system, on detecting the 

presence of an inserted cartridge, operates a test routine 
to identify which of the circularly arranged terminal pins 

is contacting which of the conductive arcuate segments and 
provides the battery power and electrical signals to be 

stored in the non-volatile memory after the identification 
routine is complete.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application discloses subject matter related to 
subject matter disclosed in commonly assigned U. S. Patent 
Application S. N. (Atty Docket 64638) entitled ORIENTATION 
INDEPENDENT, DETACHABLE FILM CARTRIDGE, MEMORY MODULE filed 
on even date herewith in the name of Robert S. Bryant. This invention relates to the field of photographic 
film cameras and film processing, and particularly to 
apparatus for providing non-volatile, electronic information 
storage and retrieval capabilities for a standard film 
cartridge. As set forth in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
5,032,854 to Smart et al., it is well known to provide 
limited information relating to film type and speed by means 
of a DX code or bar code imprinted on the exterior case or 
end of the film cartridge that may be electrically or 
optically read in to the camera's electronic control system. 
Such well known coding is employed to set exposure 
parameters of the camera automatic exposure control system, 
but is not useful in storing information related to the 
actual exposure made of an individual image frame in use of 
the camera. In order to store such information, as well as the 
image frame identification to which it pertains, and other 
information automatically entered from the camera operating  
 
system or optionally entered by the camera user, it is 
necessary to employ a further writable and readable media in 
association with either the film or the film cartridge. For example, commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,965,626 and 5,016,030 to Robinson et al. and Dwyer et al. 
(and applications listed therein) disclose photographic film 
incorporating magnetic read/write strips and read/write 
heads and systems incorporated into cameras and photo-finishing 
equipment for storing and reading out a wide 
variety of data. Alternatively, it has been proposed to magnetically 
read and write data on magnetic strips formed on the sides 
or an end of the film cartridge, as described, for example, 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,443,077 to Tanikawa. More recently, it has been suggested that data may be 
stored and retrieved from non-volatile memory chips, e.g. an 
EEPROM, incorporated in an integrated circuit chip "card" as 
set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,036,344 to Inoue et al. The 
card may be separable from the camera and film cartridge or 
may be attached to the film cartridge as set forth generally 
in U.S. Patent No. 5,070,355 to Inoue et al. Alternatively, the storage of such information in "ROM-ICs" 
attached permanently or releasably to the
