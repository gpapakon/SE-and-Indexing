for the transferase; a method of detecting α-1,3-fucosyltransferase using the cDNA and inhibiting the production 

of the transferase; a recombinant vector containing the cDNA integrated thereinto; a cell containing the vector; and 
processes for producing the above. The α-1,3-fucosyltransferase invented is useful for producing physiologically 

active sugar chains, such as sialylated Lewis X, and modifications thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel species of α-1,3-fucosyltransferase, a cDNA coding for the fucosyltransferase, a recombinant vector containing the cDNA as an insert and a cell harboring the recombinant vector as well as method of producing same. The invention further relates to a method of producing carbohydrate chains using the fucosyltransferase and to a method of producing carbohydrate chains through production of the fucosyltransferase in transformed cells. Still further, the invention relates to a method of detecting the fucosyltransferase and a method of inhibiting the production of the fucosyltransferase, both using DNA coding for the α-1,3-fucosyltransferase of the invention. The α-1,3-fucosyltransferase of the invention is useful, in particular, in the production of carbohydrate chains having a useful physiological activity, for example sialyl Lewis x, and modifications thereof.While proteins produced in prokaryotes, for example Escherichiacoli, have no carbohydrate chain, proteins and lipids produced in eukaryotes, such as yeast, fungi, plant cells and animal cells, have a carbohydrate chain bound thereto in many instances.Carbohydrate chains bound to proteins in animal cells include N-glycoside bond type carbohydrate chains (also called N-glycans) bound to an asparagine (Asn) residue in the protein and O-glycoside bond type carbohydrate chains (also called O-glycans) bound to a serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residue. It has recently been revealed that a certain kind of lipid containing a carbohydrate chain is covalently bound to a number of proteins and that those proteins are attached to the cell membrane through the lipid. This carbohydrate chain-containing lipid is called glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor.Other carbohydrate chains, including glycosaminoglycans, are also present in animal cells. Compounds comprising a protein covalently bound to a glycosaminoglycan are called proteoglycans. The glycosaminoglycans constituting the carbohydrate chains of proteoglycans are similar in structure to O-glycans, which are carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins, but differ chemically therefrom. Glycosaminoglycans comprise repeating disaccharide units composed of glucosamine or galactosamine and a uronic acid (except for keratan sulfate which has no uronic acid residue) having sulfate residues covalently bound thereto (except for hyaluronic acid which has no sulfate residue).Further carbohydrate chains in animal cells are present in substances called glycolipids. Sphingoglycolipids are one
