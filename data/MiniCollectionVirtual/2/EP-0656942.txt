C O M P O S I T I O N S A N D M E T H O D S F O R I N H I B I T I N G G RO W T H O R R E P L I C A T I O N O F V I R U S E SThe invention described and claimed herein was supported in part by grants from the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to oligonucleotides; medicaments and pharmaceutic compositions comprising the oligonucleotides; methods of detecting microbes, viruses and self-replicating nucleic acids using the oligonucleotides; methods of inhibiting growth or replication of microbes, viruses and self-replicating nucleic acids using the oligonucleotides; and therapeutic methods using the oligonucleotides to inhibit homologous and heterologous growth or replication of microbes, viruses or self-replicating nucleic acids.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAntisense RNA that can inhibit selectively gene expression at the level of translation or mRNA processing has been proposed as a possible genetic approach for the prevention and treatment of disease. Antisense RNA introduced directly into cells or expressed off transfected DNA has been shown to repress the expression of endogenous eukaryotic genes. However, the inherent properties of RNA and problems of working with RNA, such as the near ubiquitous presence of RNases in cells, reagents and supplies, has stimulated a search for 

alternative means of genetically repressing the expression of specific genes using antisense oligonucleotides. One such development is non-ionic nucleic acid analogues that contain a 3'-5' ethylphosphonate group in place of the negatively charged phosphodiester group found normally in oligonucleotides. The analogues are resistant to nuclease hydrolysis and penetrate the plasma membrane of cells in culture. Other means of improvement include the use of terminal blocking groups, intercalating agents or phosphorothioates. Antisense oligonucleotides have found limited success in inhibiting the growth of Rous sarcoma virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, simian virus 40, influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccordingly, one object of the instant invention is to provide oligonucleotides that inhibit herpesvirus growth or replication in a superior manner. A second object of the invention is to provide novel compositions and methods for inhibiting growth or replication of microbes, viruses or self- replicating nucleic acids. Another object of the invention relates to the use of multiple oligonucleotides directed to non-
