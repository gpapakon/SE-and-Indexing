<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and device for the operation of a combined-process power station burning solid fuels, in particular lignite, the compressed hot air heated in a heat exchanger (7, 8) through which the exhaust gases from a boiler (1) pass being further heated by a separate combustion process (18) to give a hot-air/exhaust-gas mixture which is then fed to a gas turbine (28). The aim of the invention is to ensure that the power station can be operated efficiently and safely when burning solid fuels, in particular lignite. This is achieved by virtue of the fact that the hot air is further heated indirectly in a separate, series-connected, solid-fuel-fired combustion chamber (18) with facilities for liquid-ash removal and the exhaust gases from this series-connected combustion chamber are utilized, independently of or in conjunction with the exhaust air from the gas turbine, in the power-generation process or in separate processes to produce energy.
