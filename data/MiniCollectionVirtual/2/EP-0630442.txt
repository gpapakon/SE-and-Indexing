<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection device works according to the solid energy accumulator principle in which an armature component (10) guided in a pump housing (8) of a reciprocating piston pump (1) driven by an electromagnet (9) is accelerated practically without resistance, the armature component (10) stores kinetic energy and strikes a piston component (14) to generate a pressure shock in a closed pressure chamber in front of the piston component (14), in that the stored kinetic energy of the armature component (10) is transmitted via the piston component (14) to the fuel in the pressure chamber. The pressure shock is used to inject fuel through an injection nozzle device (3). The armature component (10) is guided in a close fit on the piston component (14) and both components are spring-loaded against each other.
