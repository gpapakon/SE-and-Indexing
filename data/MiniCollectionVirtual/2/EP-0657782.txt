<ABSTRACT>
A toner imageable film for use with an overhead 
projector which provides a transparent clear projected 

image,comprising a transparent film substrate bearing 
on one major surface thereof a toner receiving layer, 

wherein the toner receiving layer has a lower softening 
point than the toner with which it is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imageable 
transparent film for use with an overhead projector and 
in particular, to a toner imageable transparent film 
preferred for color toner imaging and projection of a 
high quality color image. With the recent developments in the reprographic 
arts, reprographic processes are now used for forming 
color images on transparent films intended for 
projection via an overhead projector (hereinafter 
"OHP"). In these processes, black or colored toner is 
deposited patternwise onto the transparent film by 
using a reprographic apparatus, commonly called a 
copier, commercially available from a variety of 
manufacturing companies. The toner imaged film for projection prepared 
accordingly in a copier suffers from lack of clarity in 
the projected image. Particularly when a color toner 
image is applied on the transparent film, dark blurred 
areas in the image are directly observable when the 
image is projected on the screen. To solve this problem and to improve clarity and 
transparency of a projected image,
 
   JP-A- 61-36756 and 61-36762 disclose a 
process comprising overlaying a thin film to a toner 
image deposited onto a transparent film; and removing 
the thin film after melting the toner image by applying 
heat and pressure. Transparency of color image 
projection is improved by the above described process, 
however, an additional apparatus for melting the toner is 
required, and the process is more complicated.  JP-A- 2-38090 discloses 
a process comprising overlaying a thermoplastic resin 
film 20 µm or less in thickness, preferably 10 µm or 
less, on a toner image deposited onto a transparent 
film, and laminating the overlapped resin films under 
heat and pressure. In the above disclosed process, the 
thermoplastic resin film must have a higher softening 
point than the toner. This process however does not 
provide remarkable improvement in transparency or 
clarity of a toner image projected on a screen, and is 
a more complicated and expensive process using two film 
layers for each image desired. One major reason that a transparent clear 
projection image is not provided by the prior art 
procedure is believed to be that the toner image which 
is formed using a copier has a rough surface. Light 
incident on the transparent film bearing such an 
image is scattered and diffused by the rough surface of 
the toner image, and the amount of light passed through 
the toner image is decreased. As a result, a dark 
blurred image is projected on the screen. The
