<ABSTRACT>
An installation for driving, guiding and steering a vehicle wheel (R) comprises a control arm-guided spring cylinder (1A, 1B) through which a hydraulic oil passage (6') passes. The hydraulic oil passage (6') feeds a hydraulic motor (2) provided in the area of the wheel hub (13), which motor acts on a transmission mechanism (4) likewise provided in the area of the hub (13). The wheel hub (13) is essentially arranged on a level with the vehicle chassis (12), which supports a cross member (14), on which the upper end of the spring cylinder (1a) is movably supported.

A device for driving, guiding and steering a vehicle
wheel (R) held on an axle carrier (7), in a vehicle

provided with a frame (12), comprising a shock-absorbing
cylinder which comprises an outer tube (1b) and an inner

tube (1a) and through which a hydraulic oil passage (6,
6') centrally extends, and a hydraulic motor (2) which

is connected to said hydraulic oil passage (6, 6') and
which is arranged in the hub area of said vehicle wheel

(R) together with a shift transmission (4) received in
said axle carrier (7), with the lower end of said shock-absorbing

cylinder being firmly connected to said axle
carrier (7) and the upper end of said shock-absorbing

cylinder being supported on said vehicle frame (12),

characterized in
 that

said frame (12) of said vehicle is substantially lowered
to the level of the wheel axle (13),
that the outer tube (1b) of said shock-absorbing
cylinder is link-guided,
that the lower end of the outer tube (1b) of said shock-absorbing
cylinder is firmly connected to said axle

carrier (7), and 
that the upper end of the inner tube (1a) of said shock-absorbing
cylinder is supported in a spatially movable

manner in an elastic bearing (8) which is secured to a
transverse bar (14) which is supported via a carrier (9)

on said vehicle frame (12).
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that
there are provided two transverse links (3) whose ends

(3a) facing said vehicle wheel (R) are secured to the
bottom side of said axle carrier (7) and whose opposite

ends are articulated to the bottom side of said vehicle
frame (12).
A device according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the
ends (3a) of said two transverse links (3) which face

said vehicle wheel (R) are interconnected.
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in
 that the outer tube (1b) of said shock-absorbing
cylinder has secured thereto a swivel link

(10) which has supported thereon a tie rod (5) with a
ball-shaped head (11).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in
 that said shift transmission (4) is
designed to be shiftable in two steps.
