<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention provides a vaccine composition comprising a mutant or wild-type p53 protein in a form that, when presented to the immune system of a mammal, induces an effective immune response, i.e., either on the surface of an antigen presenting cell or combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant. Further, the subject invention provides a method of inhibiting the growth of tumors in mammals comprising treating a mammal with an immunologically effective amount of a vaccine comprising the mutant or wild-type p53 protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a vaccine for
treating cancer. The vaccine comprises a p53 protein as
the immunogen.The p53 gene, which is found on chromosome 17p of the
human genome, is a tumor suppressor gene in its wild-type
state. A review article by Levine et al. entitled "The
p53 Tumor Suppressor Gene" appears in Nature 351, 453-456
(1991).More than 50% of human tumors contain cells
expressing a mutant form of the p53 gene. In many tumors,
one allele of the p53 gene contains a point mutation that
encodes a mutant form of the protein while the other
allele is partially or totally lost. This pattern is
observed, for example, in approximately 70-80% of colon
cancers, 50% of breast cancers, and 50% of lung cancers
including 100% of small cell lung cancers. Suggestions
have been made to diagnose cancers by detecting the loss
of wild type p53 (see Vogelstein et al., European Patent
Application 390,323 and Baker et al., Science 244, 217-221
(1989).The position or location of the point mutation in the
p53 gene differs in different types of tumors. For
example, 50% of the hepatocellular carcinomas in humans
exposed to hepatitis B and aflotoxin contain p53 mutations 
at codon 249; lung tumors appear to contain mutations
preferentially at codons 154 and 273; colon tumors have
multiple independent mutations at codons 175, 248, and
273. Evidence has been presented that various
phenotypes, including the severity and nature of cancer
and pre-cancer states, can be distinguished by determining
the site of p53 mutations. See Levine et al.,
International Application No. PCT/US91/04608, filed June
27, 1991.Approximately 10-20% of humans with cancers have
tumors that produce antibodies directed against the p53
protein; de Fromentel et al., International Journal of
Cancer 39, 185-189 (1987); Crawford et al., International
Journal of Cancer 30, 403-408 (1982). The presence of
these antibodies suggests that class II receptors of the
human HLA or the murine H-2 locus can present peptide
antigens of p53 to the CD-4 helper T-cell and B-cell
system, resulting in an immune response. Antibodies are
not, however, believed to be effective anti-tumor agents.
Therefore, the presence of anti-p53 antibodies in humans
with cancer does not suggest the possibility of cancer
patients producing an effective anti-tumor immune
response.There are reports that animals immunized with a tumor
antigen are protected against the same antigen. Thus,
immunizing animals with simian virus 40 (SV40) large T
antigen can protect against subsequent
