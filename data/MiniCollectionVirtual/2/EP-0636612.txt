<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic 
acid derivative, represented by general formula (II), 

or a salt thereof (wherein R¹, R² and R³ may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen, hydroxy 
or lower alkoxy; and R⁴ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl or aralkyl) by the reaction of a phenylalanine derivative represented 

by general formula (I) with formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde in the presence of sulfuric or hydrobromic acid, 
wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are each as defined above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
safely producing 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic 
acid derivatives useful as medical 
intermediates. A process for producing 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic 
acid derivatives by 
allowing phenylalanine derivatives to react with 
formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde in the presence of an 
acid is known as the Pictet Spengler reaction [Journal 
of Organic Chemistry, 16, 430 (1951), Indian Journal of 
Chemistry, 13, 230 (1975), Chemical and Pharmaceutical 
Bulletin, 31(1), 312 (1983), and Japanese Published 
Unexamined Patent Application Nos. 16865/82 and 
193969/90]. In these known methods, hydrochloric acid is used 
as an acid catalyst. However, in this case, it has 
been known that bis(chloromethyl)ether, which is a 
strong mutagen [IARC Monographs, 4, 231 (1974)], is 
formed through the reaction of hydrochloric acid with  
 
formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde [Organic Synthesis 
Coll. Vol. 4, 101-103 (1963)]. Further when hydrochloric acid is used as an acid 
catalyst, the resultant product of the Pictet Spengler 
reaction using L-phenylalanine as a substrate has an 
optical purity of 50 to 85 % ee and accompanies a high 
degree of racemization occurs. (Japanese Published 
Unexamined Patent Application No. 193969/90). The present invention relates to a process for 
safely producing 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic 
acid derivatives [hereinafter referred to as 
"Compound (II)"] or salts thereof represented by the 
following formula (II): 
wherein R¹, R², and R³ independently represent hydrogen, 
hydroxyl or lower alkoxyl, and R⁴ represent hydrogen, 
lower alkyl, aryl or aralkyl, the process comprising, 
allowing phenylalanine derivatives to react with  
 
formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde in the presence of 
sulfuric acid or hydrobromic acid, the phenylalanine 
derivatives being represented by the following formula 
(I): 
wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ have the same meaning as 
defined above. In the definition of R¹, R² and R³, the lower alkyl 
and the alkyl moiety in the lower alkoxy mean a straight 
chain or branched alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms 
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, 
isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, 
neopentyl and hexyl. The aryl means phenyl or naphthyl. 
The aralkyl means benzyl, phenetyl or trityl each having 
7 to 20 carbon atoms. The salts of Compound (II) 
include sulfates and hydrobromides. The process for producing Compound (II) is 
described below.  Compound (II)
