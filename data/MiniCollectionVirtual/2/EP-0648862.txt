<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming dielectric thin film 
coating suitable for use in magnetic thin film heads 

includes the application of a spin-on-glass material on 
a substrate, the spinning of the substrate, the 

preheating of the substrate and thin film to remove the 
solvents in the spin-on-glass material, and the heating 

in a reducing or in an inert atmosphere of the film to 
provide a conversion to a SiO₂ film. The reducing and 

the inert atmospheres permit carbon to be left in the 
film. The presence of the carbon improves structural 

properties of the thin films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processes for 
the fabrication of thin films and, more particularly, 
to a process for providing amorphous dielectric coating 
which results in superior strength and the elimination 
of substrate surface defects. The spin-on process has been used to 
planarize and smooth-out pits on the substrate surface 
in the fabrication of inductive recording heads and 
magneto-resistive heads. In the past, the spin-on or 
amorphous procedure has resulted in the film eventually 
being converted to a near-stoichiometric SiO₂ at high 
temperatures (> 500°C). The conversion to nearstoichiometric 
SiO₂ is revealed by the refractive index 
value of 1.45-1.46 and confirmed by an ESCA analysis. While the spin-on technique has provided 
satisfactory dielectric thin film coatings for a 
substrate surface, none-the-less, a need has been found 
for dielectric thin film coatings which not only 
planarize the surface, for example, of a magnetic head, 
but which have improved hardness and wear resistance 
parameters. The present invention is directed to 
overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above. 
Briefly summarized, according to one aspect of the 
present invention, the typical spin-on procedure is 
implemented in which the thin film is exposed to either 
a reducing atmosphere or to a Nobel gas atmosphere  
 
during the conversion of the film to SiO₂. The use of 
the reducing and inert atmospheres increases the 
residual carbon remaining in the resulting film and 
improves the structural properties of the film. The heating of the amorphous film in a 
reducing atmosphere during which a carbide phase is 
formed in the oxide matrix provides improved hardness 
and wear resistance properties. These and other aspects, objects, features 
and advantages of the present invention will be more 
clearly understood and appreciated from a review of the 
following detailed description of the preferred 
embodiments and appended claims, and be reference to 
the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 provides a flow diagram of the spin-on 
process according to the present invention. The spin-on coatings, in accordance with the 
present invention, are prepared as shown in Fig. 1. A 
spin-on solution is applied to a substrate in step 101. 
After application of the solution, the substrate is 
spun, in step 102 at a speed generally within the range 
from 500 to 7,000 rpm and depositing onto the center of 
the spinning substrate a suitable quantity of a spin-on 
solution. The materials generally employed for the
