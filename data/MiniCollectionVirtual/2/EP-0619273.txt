<ABSTRACT>
A dephosphorization material disposed so that a material containing 
iron as a main component and a calcium compound material 

contact a phosphorus-containing aqueous solution, and provided with 
a water-permeable material around the material containing iron as a 

main component. A phosphorus component of sewage and river water 
can be removed easily by simply bringing this dephosphorization 

material into contact with such phosphorus-containing aqueous solutions, 
without employing any special solution control method. This 

dephosphorization material is capable of reducing the outflow of iron 
rust occurring due to the oxidation of iron during a dephosphorization 

of a phosphorus-containing aqueous solution, and the iron effluent 
can be eliminated by the action of the calcium compound material. 

Accordingly, this dephosphorization material can be applied pratically 
to sewage and river water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dephosphorizing 
material for effectively removing phosphorus component in 
sewages, rivers and the like, and to an easy and 
convenient method of dephosphorization using such 
dephosphorizing material. Various discussions have hitherto been made as to a 
dephosphorizing process in sewages, rivers and the like, 
and pilot experiments have been made in various parts of 
the country. For example, a method of contact 
dephosphorization is known, wherein water containing 
phosphorus is controlled under appropriate conditions to 
bring into contact with a compound of same species and 
same system consisting of calcium phosphate, and calcium 
phosphate (hydroxy apatite) is formed and crystallized on 
the compound. In the contact dephosphorization method, the 
concentration of the phosphorus component in water can be 
lowered effectively. However, since the phosphorus-containing 
water requires pH adjustment by a 
decarboxylating process or addition of lime in order to 
control such crystallizing reaction, and such control 
should be made all the time, this method has a drawback 
to complicate the process. Therefore, the development is 
desired of a method for effectively removing phosphorus 
which is economically superior as well as easy and 
convenient, and of dephosphorizing material which can be  
 
used in such a method. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
novel dephosphorizing material which can remove a 
phosphorus component effectively in sewages, rivers and 
the like as well as decrease the amount of iron rust. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a dephosphorizing method wherein a phosphorus 
component can be readily removed in sewages, rivers and 
the like without special control or the like. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided a dephosphorizing material characterized in that 
a material containing iron as a main component and a 
calcium compound material are arranged to contact a 
phosphorus-containing aqueous solution, and in that a 
water permeable material is provided at least around said 
material containing iron as a main component. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
also provided a method of dephosphorization characterized 
in that the aforementioned dephosphorizing material is 
brought into contact with the phosphorus-containing 
aqueous solution. Fig. 1 is a partial perspective view depicting a 
dephosphorizing material produced in Example 1. Fig. 2 is a graph showing
