<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to storage-stable (cyclo)aliphatic polyisocyanate mixtures which can be obtained by phosgene-free processes, preferably by thermal cleavage of (cyclo)aliphatic polycarbamates and which comprise, for stabilisation, at least one primary stabiliser (2a), preferably a sterically hindered phenol and/or aromatic amine, or at least one secondary stabiliser (2b), preferably an organic phosphite and/or a thioether, or at least one acidic stabiliser (2c), preferably a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid chloride, an inorganic acid, an inorganic acid chloride and/or a phosphoric acid diester, or a stabiliser system of at least two of the stabilisers (2a) to (2c), to a process for the preparation of the (cyclo)aliphatic polyisocyanate mixtures, and to their preferred use for the preparation of isocyanurate-containing polyisocyanates.
