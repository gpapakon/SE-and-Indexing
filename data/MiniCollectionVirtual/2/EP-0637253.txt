<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel charge-modified chelators useful to attach
radioactive metal ions to tumor selective antibodies.Functionalized chelants, or bifunctional coordinators, are known to be capable of
being covalently attached to an antibody having specificity for cancer or tumor cell epitopes or
antigens. Radionuclide complexes of such antibody/chelant conjugates are useful in diagnostic
and/or therapeutic applications as a means of conveying the radionuclide to a cancer or tumor
cell. See, for example. Meares et al., Anal. Biochem., 124, 68-78 (1984); and Krejcarek et al.,
Biochem and Biophys. Res. Comm., 77, 581-585 (1977).Attachment of the metal ion to a protein such as an antibody has been achieved
by complexation by an acyclic chelate such as carboxymethylated amine derivatives of
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (U.S. Patent 4,662,420) or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA) (U.S. Patents 4,479,930 and 4,454,106), covalently linked to the
antibody. Such acyclic complexes, however, tend to be unstable in vivo either as a result of
acid-catalyzed decomplexation or competitive chelate binding by calcium or zinc in serum. The
lack of stability can result in uncomplexed metal atoms in the body which have a cytotoxic
effect on healthy tissue (e.g., bone marrow).The use of macrocyclic chelating compounds has the advantage of
a higher stability. EP-A-0 255 471 discloses macrocyclic chelating
compounds for diagnostic and therapeutic use applicable in high
doses as their complexes with metal ions or radioactive isotopes
are very stable. In addition, the complex can be linked by
biological substances or substances capable of interacting with
biological systems. Low molecular weight substances, e.g. glucose,
amino acids or fatty acids, as well as high molecular weight
substances, e.g. polysaccharides or antibodies can be used.
Furthermore, these compounds have the advantage of a low allergic
potency. Alternatively to acyclic chelates macrocyclic ligands can
be used for the labeling of antibodies. Certain macrocyclic
bifunctional chelating agents and the use of
their copper chelate conjugates for diagnostic or therapeutic applications have been disclosed
in U.S Patent 4,678,667 and by Moi et al., Inorg. Chem., 26, 3458-3463 (1987). Attachment of
the aminocarboxylic acid functionality to the rest of the bifunctional cheating molecule is
through a ring carbon of the cyclic polyamine backbone. Thus, a linker attached at one end to 
a ring carbon of the cyclic polyamine, is also
