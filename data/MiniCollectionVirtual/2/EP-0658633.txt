<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foil of an 
Al-containing stainless steel having a superior oxidation 
resistance and strength at high temperatures and 
suitable for use as a catalyst carrier for purifying an 
exhaust gas of an automobile or the like, and to a 
process for the preparation thereof. Note, it is 
difficult to reduce the thickness of an Al-containing 
stainless steel. Ceramics long have been used as the catalyst 
carrier for purifying exhaust gases from combustion 
systems. For example, there can be mentioned a monolithic 
catalyst carrier for furifying an automobile 
exhaust gas, which comprised of ceramic honeycomb formed 
by firing a ceramic material composed mainly of 
cordierite in a honeycomb shape, a porous γ-Al₂O₃ powder 
impregnated with a noble metal such as Pt or Pd which is 
coated on the said honeycomb and metalic outer shell 
which holds the ceramic honeycomb. This ceramic 
honeycomb is defective, however, in that the resistance 
thereof to mechanical shock is low and the air 
permeation resistance in high because of its large wall 
thickness. Recently, a metal honeycomb has been 
proposed as a substitute for this ceramic honeycomb. An important property required for this metal 
carrier in a superior oxidation resistance, and as a 
honeycomb material satisfying this requirement, Japanese 
Examined Patent Publication No. 63-24740 proposes an 
Al-containing ferritic stainless steel foil. By using 
this Al-containing ferritic stainless steel foil it  
 
becomes possible to improve the mechanical strength, 
because the wall thickness can be reduced and the air 
permeation resistance lowered. Furthermore, to ensure 
that this catalyst work efficiently, preferably the 
catalyst carrier is set at a position as close an 
possible to the combustion system. Accordingly, an 
Al-containing stainless steel foil having a superior 
strength at a higher temperature, is also desired 
recently, and an Al-containing austenitic stainless 
steel foil is regarded as a promising example of this 
kind of steel foil. This metal carrier is prepared by a process in 
which an Al-containing stainless steel is formed into 
flat and corrugated foils having a thickness of scores 
of µm, these coils are alternately disposed to form a 
layer or wound to form a cylindrical honeycomb, and this 
layer or cylindrical honeycomb is held in a metal outer 
shell instead of the above-mentioned ceramic honeycomb. Several processes have been proposed for 
preparing an Al-containing stainless steel foil for the 
metal
