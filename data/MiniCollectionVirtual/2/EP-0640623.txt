<ABSTRACT>
A powder-free coagulant for use in latex dipping 
processes comprises a salt stable dispersion of a 

polymer eg a chlorinated rubber and an inorganic 
coagulant. Optionally the coagulant will also contain 

a powder-free release agent, to aid release of the 
dipped article from the former, comprising a 

polyethylene wax emulsion and a cationic surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rubber articles
produced by latex dipping, to methods of making such
articles and to materials used therefor. More
particularly the invention relates to a coagulant and
methods of pretreating a former using the coagulant, in
particular but not exclusively in relation to a method
for the production of powder free natural rubber latex
medical gloves.It is well known that natural rubber medical
gloves are produced by a dipping process from natural
rubber latex. The latex contains vulcanization agents
that to cure the natural rubber, after dipping, to
produce a dry rubber film. The film surface of the
cured natural rubber is quite "tacky" and therefore it
is necessary to incorporate powders as detackifying
agents. Different powders are used to facilitate the
release of a glove from a glove former during
manufacture and to aid the donning of the gloves.The use of powder may cause respiratory problems
for workers during the manufacturing process and for
the healthcare staff and patients during the subsequent
use. Also, the use of particulate donning aids such as
starch or talc for surgeon's gloves may have the
disadvantage that particles can drop off the glove into
the wound possibly resulting in granuloma. In order to
avoid the use of donning powders other attempts to
improve the donning properties of the glove have
included the treatment of the hand contacting surface
of the glove by halogenation or by lamination with
another material having better donning properties than 
the base rubber. Generally the trend in the medical
glove market has been to the production of powder free
gloves. It is known through PCT Application No:
PCT/US92/08575 to produce gloves which eliminate the
powder required to facilitate the donning. However,
this technique has not overcome the problem of the use
of powder during the manufacturing process which causes
many problems as outlined above.Thus, the present invention seeks to provide a
solution to the above-mentioned problems by providing a
powder-free coagulant and a process for the manufacture
of rubber articles which eliminates the need for a
powder to facilitate the release of the glove from the
former during manufacture.According to the present invention there is
provided a coagulant composition for a natural rubber
latex which comprises a salt stable polymer dispersion
and an inorganic salt coagulating agent for natural
rubber latex.Optionally according to an embodiment of the
present invention the coagulant composition of the
invention may be
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A powder-free coagulant composition for natural
rubber latex, which composition comprises a salt stable

dispersion of a polychloroprene or a polyurethane and an
inorganic salt coagulating agent for natural rubber latex.
A composition according to Claim 1 comprising not
more than 20% by weight of polymer.
A composition according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein
the salt stable polymer dispersion is a polychloroprene

having a content in a range of 2% to 8% of the total
coagulating agent content.
A composition according to any one of Claims 1 to
3, wherein the inorganic salt is a divalent cationic metal

salt.
A composition according to Claim 4, wherein the
inorganic salt is selected from the group consisting of

calcium nitrate, calcium chloride, zinc nitrate, zinc
chloride, magnesium acetate and aluminium sulphate.
A composition according to Claim 5, wherein the
inorganic salt is an aqueous solution of calcium nitrate.
A composition according to Claim 6, wherein the
calcium nitrate content is in a range of 20% to 35% of the

composition.
A composition according to any preceding claim
further comprising a release agent which comprises a

polyethylene wax emulsion and a cationic surface active
agent. 
A composition according to Claim 8, wherein the
polyethylene wax is present in an amount of not more than

10% by weight of the composition.
A composition according to Claim 8, wherein the
polyethylene wax content is in the range of 0.5 to 5% of

the composition.
A composition according to any one of Claims 8 to
10, wherein the cationic surface active agent is present in

an amount of not more than 15% by weight of the
composition.
A method according to any one of Claims 8 to 11, in
which a cross-linking agent is added to cure the salt

stable polymer dispersion.
A method of preparing a dipped rubber article which
includes the steps of: dipping a preheated former for the

article into a composition as defined in any one of Claims
1 to 12 to form a coagulant coated former; dipping the

coagulant coated former into a compounded natural rubber
latex to form a gelled latex film; leaching the gelled

latex film; over-dipping the gelled latex film with
copolymers of vinyl methyl ether and maleic esters; curing

the coated, gelled over-dipped latex film on the former in
an oven; and further over-dipping the former with a

silicone emulsion.
A powder free glove comprising cured natural rubber
latex having on its outer non-wearer contacting surface

residues of a release agent comprising residues of a
polyethylene wax and a cationic surface active agent, which

residues are due to a former for the glove being dipped in
the composition of any one of Claims 8 to 12.
