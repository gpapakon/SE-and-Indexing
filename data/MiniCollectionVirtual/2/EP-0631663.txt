<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of and a device for measuring optical radiation. In the method, the intensity (2) of a radiation coming from an object (1) to be measured and to be lighted by collimated radiation is measured at several wavelength by focusing the radiation by an optical means (4) and a mirror means (6) on a detector group (3) comprising several detector elements (3a to 3d). The radiation coming from the object (1) to be measured is directed by the optical means (4) and the planar mirror means (6) in such a way that, by rotating the mirror means (6) tilted with respect to its axis (5) round this axis (5) and by keeping the radiation on the surface of the same planar mirror means (6), the focus (F) of radiation is moved in a detector plane (D) along a regular uninterrupted path (R) alternatingly over each detector element (3a to 3d) positioned substantially in the same plane and excited at a different wavelength.

<DESCRIPTION>
A method of and a device for measuring optical radiationThe invention relates to a method of measuring optical radiation, in which method the intensity of a radiation coming from an object to be measured and to be lighted by collimated radiation is measured at several wavelengths by focusing the radiation by an optical means and a mirror means on a detector group comprising several detector elements.Spectroscopic measurements are based on an in¬ vestigation of a spectrum of radiation coming from an object to be measured. It depends on the properties of the object to be measured how the spectral distri- bution of the radiation, which is reflected or emit¬ ted from the object or which has penetrated the ob¬ ject, is within a frequency range. For instance, the thickness of a film of slushing oil or impurities on the surface of the object influences the distribution and amplitude of the spectrum reflected from the ob¬ ject or, in practice, from the film on the surface.Typical of spectroscopic measurements is that the radiation to be obtained from a spot-like light source to be used is collimated, i.e. made parallel, and the object to be measured is lighted by this ra¬ diation.Detectors to be used in spectroscopic measure¬ ments comprise several detector elements connected to each other, each detector element measuring radiation coming from an object within different wavelength ranges. For a successful spectroscopic measurement, each detector element should see the object at the same incidence angle, in order that the multichannel detector formed by the detector elements may be used for measuring relative intensities of different wave- 

lengths of the spectrum of the radiation reflected. In practice, it is, however, necessary to position the detector elements relatively far from each other for structural technical reasons, due to which the detector elements see the same object at slightly different angles or the radiation comes to the sepa¬ rate detector elements at the same angle, but has started from another part of the object than the ra¬ diation arrived at the rest of the detector elements. These problems appearing as error factors in measure¬ ments cannot be eliminated by a fixed optics.To eliminate these problems, it is 'known to use a diffuser in front of the detector elements. A par¬ allel radiation bundle coming to the diffuser is dif- fused in the diffuser, which leads to that the radia¬ tion coming to the elements is mixed in different di¬ rections.
