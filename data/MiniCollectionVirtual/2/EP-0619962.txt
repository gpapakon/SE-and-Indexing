<ABSTRACT>
An engagement device, particularly usable for toothed 
bands of sports shoes, such as for example ski boots, roller 

skates or ice skates, including a single body (7) that can 
be associated with the shoe and has at least one first slot 

(13) for the sliding insertion of the toothed band. First 
teeth (18) for the temporary engagement with traction of the 

band are provided at the first slot. There is also a curved 
surface (20) suitable to force the interaction of the set of 

teeth (17) of the band (16) with the first teeth (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engagement device
usable for toothed bands of shoes, particulary sport shoes, such
as for example ski boots, ice skates or roller skates.Currently, these kinds of shoes are usually constituted
by a shell with which at least one quarter is associated.In order to secure the shell or the quarter it is known
to use levers which are pivoted to a baseplate, that must be
associated for example with a flap of the shell, and
interact for example with the end of a toothed band which is
associated, at its other end, with the other flap of the
shell by virtue of mechanical retention means, such as for
example a block provided with a pawl that can be actuated by
means of a pushbutton and with which the set of teeth of the
band engages.This solution for engaging the band with the shell or
quarter has some drawbacks: in fact, on one hand the block
must be riveted to the shell or quarter, and on the other
hand said block protrudes from said shell or quarter.Thus, in case of accidental impacts said block cannot
be replaced by the user, as replacement usually requires the
aid of specialized personnel.Last but not least, the block has a certain number of
components, such as the pawl, the baseplate, one or more
springs, pivots and rivets, which require assembly
operations to obtain the finished part.For example, U.S. patent No. 4,229,862 discloses a
lever connectable to a baseplate which can be associated
with the shell or with the quarter by means of a link; said 
lever has, between its wings, a ratchet-like element that
interacts with a toothed band insertable between said
ratchet-like element and the lever.This solution is constructively complicated and in any
case, as regards the engagement with the shell or quarter,
it has considerable protrusions that can lead to unwanted
accidental impacts.EP-A-0 220 784 discloses a ratchet fastener for a
toothed band of a closure lever, including a base to be
fixed to a ski boot flap having a pair of lateral sides, and
a movable dentelated body which is connected to the lateral
sides of the base by means of a pair of sliding and spaced
apart pins. This fastener is also constructively
complicated requiring many separately manufactured parts
which must be assembled to form the fastener.A principal object of the present invention is
therefore to eliminate the above-described drawbacks in
known types by providing an engagement device that allows to
rapidly and easily connect a toothed band with a shell or a
quarter and at the same time has very

Engagement device for a toothed band of
a shoe, particularly sports shoes, such as ski boots, roller

skates or ice skates, the engagement device comprising a
single body (7) that can be associated with a shoe portion

and which has at least one first slot (13) for the sliding
insertion of the loose end (19) of said toothed band, first

means (18) for the temporary engagement with traction of
said band being provided in said single body.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that
said first means are provided at said at least one first

slot, and in that said device has second supporting means
(10,20) suitable to force the interaction of the set of

teeth of said band with said first means.
Device according to claim 1, usable in sports shoes,
comprising a shell (2) with which at least one quarter (3)

is associated, characterized in that it is associable at a
flap (5) of said shell or at a lateral end (6) of said at

least one quarter, said single body (7) being made of rigid
plastics and having a partially hollow head (8).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that
an annular ridge (9) is provided below said head and is

joined, in a downward region, to a tab (10) which protrudes
radially therefrom.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that
said first slot (13) is formed on said head (8) transversely

to said tab (10).
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that

the height of said annular ridge (9) is approximately equal 
to the thickness of said shell or quarter and can be

arranged, in a snap-together manner, within an adapted hole
(12) formed on said shell or quarter.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that a
lug (11) protrudes from said annular ridge (9) on the side

opposite to said tab.
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first means (18) for the

temporary engagement with traction of a band are provided at
said first slot, and in that tension can be applied to said

band at its other end by a lever or another tensioning
device, said band having a set of teeth (17) directed toward

said shell or quarter.
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that
said first means are constituted by one or more first teeth

(18) formed at said first slot (13) and parallel thereto
starting from its end which is adjacent to said lug (11),

said first teeth having an inclination which is
approximately opposite to the inclination of said set of

teeth (17).
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that
said one or more first teeth (18) have mutually different

dimensions and angles of inclination with respect to said
bottom of said tab.
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that
said one or more first teeth have, starting from the region

adjacent to said lug toward said tab, dimensions that
increase up to said opening and different inclinations.
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the lower surface (20) of said 

head, on the side opposite to said one or more first teeth,
is curved so as to facilitate the insertion of the loose end

of said band and make it slide until it reaches said bottom
(14) of said tab.
Device according to claim 12, characterized in that
said curved surface (20) and said bottom (14) constitute

said second supporting means which are suitable to force the
interaction of said set of teeth of said band with said

first means constituted by said one or more first teeth.
Device according to claim 13, characterized in that
the plane of arrangement of said bottom (14) is at a lower

level than the planes of arrangement of said one or more
first teeth (18).
Device according to claim 14, characterized in that
said tab has two lateral walls (21a,21b) that protrude at

right angles from said bottom and guide the sliding of said
band.
