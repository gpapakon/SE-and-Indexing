<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photosensitive resin composition,
more specifically to a photosensitive resin composition
having an excellent film property, heat-resistance,
adhesivity and image-formability which does not require
complex steps for preparation and does not cause contamination
with chlorides.In the semiconductor industries, inorganic materials have
conventionally been used for interlaminar insulation.
Recently, organic materials having an excellent heat-resistance
such as a polyimide resin have been put to use as
materials for interlaminar insulation because of properties
thereof.A process for forming a pattern in a semiconductor integrated
circuit or forming a pattern of a circuit on a print
substrate comprises complex and various steps such as formation 
of a resist material film on the substrate surface;
exposure of required portion to light; removal of unnecessary
portion by etching or so; and washing of the base surface.
Therefore, development of heat-resistant photosensitive
materials have been desired, which enables the
required portion of the resist material to be used as insulating
materials even after the pattern is formed by exposure
to light and development.As such a material, heat-resistant photosensitive materials
comprising, for example, a photosensitive polyimide or a
cyclized polybutadiene as a base polymer have been proposed.
The photosensitive polyimide has attracted attentions
since it has an excellent heat-resistance and impurities
can easily be removed.As such a photosensitive polyimide, for example, a photosensitive
polyimide precursor (a polyamic acid ester) in
which a photosensitive group is introduced into the polyimide
precursor by an ester bond is proposed in Japanese
Patent Publication No. 30207/1980. This material which
requires the use of an acid chloride group in synthesis of
the photosensitive polyimide precursor has a disadvantage
that a finally obtained photosensitive resin composition is
easily contaminated with the chloride. Also, thermal cure
of the polyamic acid ester to obtain the objective polyimide
requires a high temperature, and therefore, the polyamic
acid ester cannot be used when an element which
cannot be heated at a high temperature is used.As another example, a photosensitive resin composition
which mainly comprises a mixture of a polyamic acid, an
amine having a photoactive functional group and an azide
compound as a photosensitizer is proposed in Japanese
Provisional Patent Publication No. 168942/1982. However, the photosensitive resin
