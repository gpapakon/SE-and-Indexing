<ABSTRACT>
A radiant heating furnace comprising a housing which is split into at least two parts which are movably mounted so that they can be brought together to enclose a specimen to be heated, each part including at least one substantially linearly extending radiant heat source, so that the sample can be heated uniformly, at least on two opposite sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RADIANT HEATING FURNACEThis invention relates to furnaces, and particularly to furnaces of the type adapted to focus a large amount of radiant energy over a small area, such as a narrow elongated specimen.It is known to utilise quartz halogen lamps, and particularly, linear quartz halogen lamps, in housings with suitably shaped reflectors, to provide an intense heating effect over a small area. Examples of heaters employing such techniques are the models 5215 and 5193 "line heaters" of Research Inc. of Minneapolis Minnesota 55424 USA.There are still a number of difficulties with devices of this kind, particularly because the known devices do not provide a uniform heating effect all around an elongate or linear object, and in particular, there is a need for furnaces capable of reaching very high temperatures, but concentrating the heat in the specimen itself rather than heating up the whole furnace, so that the furnace can be kept very compact. It is also desirable to be able to heat up samples very quickly, which also makes it desirable for the furnace to be kept compact. In particular, this is desirable in situations in which a specimen is being tested for its performance under extreme conditions, such as the heating conditions experienced by materials used in turbines. It is frequently required to be able to examine such specimens, at very close quarters, even whilst they are actually being subjected to heat treatment, so as to understand, (for example) how faults such as cracks will propagate in the sample under these circumstances.Consequently, it is necessary to keep the furnace as small as possible, and to avoid "leakage" of heat into the outside environment, so as to enable the sample to be 

 inspected at close quarters, for example by means of a "telescope" arrangement, and also to facilitate a so-called "cold gripping" arrangement (i.e. allowing parts of the specimen to extend outside the furnace without further cooling) .Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a furnace comprising a body which is split into at least two parts which are movably mounted so that they can be brought together to enclose a specimen to be heated, each part including at least one substantially linear radiant heat source, so that the sample can be heated uniformly, at least on two opposite sides.It will be appreciated that by the expression "substantially linear radiant heat source", it is intended that the heat source comprises one or more radiant heating elements, which are so arranged in

CLAIMS
(1) A radiant heating furnace comprising a housing which is split into at least two parts which are movably mounted so that they can be brought together to enclose a specimen to be heated, each part including at least one substantially linearly extending radiant heat source, so that the sample can be heated uniformly, at least on two opposite sides.
(2) A furnace according to claim 1 in which the heat source comprises a heating element assembly including a plurality of lamps such as quartz halogen lamps, which are powered so as to emit a substantial part of their energy in the infra-red region, and which are arranged along the inside of a generally elongate, bowl shaped reflector, whose internal surface is shaped so as to compensate for the distribution of the heat source elements.
(3) A furnace according to claim 2 further comprising control means for controlling the supply of energy to the lamps so as to vary the distribution of energy in different regions of the furnace.
(4) A furnace according to claim 2 in which the lamps are arranged in a line along the reflector, and in which the ends of the "bowl shape" are deeply curved in a "re-entrant" shape, so as to compensate for the "fall-off" in output at each end of the linear array of lamps, and so that the maximum concentration of heat occurs at or near the front opening of the reflector.
(5) A furnace according to claim 1 including a single "linear" lamp mounted in an elongate bowl shaped reflector 


 which is suitably curved at each end, to compensate for the less even distribution of energy in that region of the lamp.
(6) A furnace according to any preceding claim in which the housing comprises two halves which are pivotally mounted on support means so that they can be pivoted into engagement to enclose an article to be heated, each half carrying a pair of adjustably mounted heating element assemblies which are directed towards the centre of the furnace, the heating element assemblies being so arranged, relative to one another, that when the furnace is enclosed around the article they substantially surround it.
(7) A furnace according to any of claims 1 to 5 in which the housing comprises four axially extending heating element assemblies each of which comprises one quadrant of a lateral cross section through the furnace, relative to the heating axis, and is provided with a slidable mounting which allows its position to be adjusted at least in a radial direction, and preferably also in a circumferential direction relative to the axis.
(8) A furnace according to claim 6 or claim 7 in which the heating element assemblies are so shaped and arranged that they cooperate to substantially enclose the article being heated when the housing is closed, and concentrate the radiant heat output at an adjustable focus in the central region.
(9) A furnace according to any of claims 6 to 8 in which each heating element assembly comprises a metal body which is machined to form the required reflector shape and also to form internal channels for the circulation of fluid coolant so that a separate cooling jacket is not required.
