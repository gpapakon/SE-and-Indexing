<ABSTRACT>
A system, according to the present invention, provides temporary facsimile services to facsimile machines provided in hotel rooms. The system includes an intermediary having a host of direct in-dial telephone numbers which can be selectively activated and assigned to any one facsimile machine of a plurality of facsimile machines. The facsimile machines can be selectively authorized by assigning thereto for a temporary period a direct in-dial telephone number from the host of direct in-dial numbers of the intermediary. The intermediary activates the direct in-dial number whereafter the authorized facsimile machine is capable of receiving transmissions sent to the direct in-dial telephone number via the intermediary. The system maintains the direct in-dial number activated until the expiry of the temporary period and thereafter deactivates the direct in-dial number. The direct in-dial number is maintained deactivated for a down period of time whereby any facsimile transmissions sent to the direct in-dial number during the down period of time is not received. In this way, provision is made not to receive any transmissions to the direct in-dial number during any down period whereby the guest is ensured transmissions destined for the particular guest are not received immediately after his departure from the hotel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to providing 
facsimile services to each of a host of locations each 
controlled by a PBX system. A number of telephone communication services have 
been proposed and are disclosed in United States Patents 
US-A-4,713,837, US-A-4,905,273, US-A-4,922,518, US-A-4,942,599, 
and US-A-4,969,184. Hotels have recognized the desire of some guests to 
receive or have available to them facsimile services 
whereby they can transmit and receive documents. Many 
hotels now have a business area which will transmit and 
receive documents for guests. However, the level of this 
service is certainly well below that normally experienced 
by the guest who would have his own dedicated facsimile 
machine. Some hotels have provided a facsimile 
transmitting booth in a common area of the hotel. However, 
again, although this provides the user with some privacy 
with respect to the transmission of documents, it is not 
particularly convenient with respect to the receipt of 
documents. Any receipt of documents must be prearranged 
such that the user is at the particular facsimile booth at 
the time the document is received. A further problem in providing adequate facsimile 
services to hotels is-the existing telephone wiring within 
the hotels which generally do not have the capacity to have 
a dedicated facsimile machine in each hotel room. 
Furthermore, the hotel PBX system is typically answered by 
an operator whereby any facsimile transmissions are 
initially received by the operator and thus, normal 
facsimile transmission is not possible.  
 There remains a need to provide a simple, effective 
facsimile service for establishments having a PBX system 
which service does not require rewiring of the property and 
which does not compromise the privacy and security of the 
user. The method and system for providing temporary facsimile services 
to facsimile machines are set out in claims 1, and 3 and 16 respectively. 
The invention, when applied to 
facsimile machines in separate rooms of a hotel, assures 
that a document transmitted by facsimile machine to a guest 
in a hotel room after that guest has checked out of the 
room will not be received by the next guest in that room, 
as would be the case if the facsimile number was 
permanently assigned to the machine. According to an aspect of the invention, the 
facsimile machine, or a device attached thereto, is capable 
of receiving a non-telephone communication which  
 
communicates to the machine, or the device attached 
thereto, that a
