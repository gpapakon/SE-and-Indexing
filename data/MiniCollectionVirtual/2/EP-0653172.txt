<ABSTRACT>
The water collector includes a catcher member 1 having 
a plurality of resilient arms 13 radially secured to a 

central collar 11 or a retainer 4 fixed on a tip portion 
51 of an umbrella 5. An absorbent lining 2 is secured 

to an inner surface of the catcher member 1 for 
absorbing rainwater or raindrops drained from a wet 

umbrella when retracted or closed, and a web member 3 is 
circumferentially disposed around an outer surface of 

the catcher member 1. Upon opening of the umbrella its 
cloth is urged by the umbrella ribs and tensioning 

springs so that the rainwater absorbed and held in the 
absorbent lining 2 is squeezed out as the lining is 

pressed between the opened umbrella cloth and the 
resilient arms 13.

<DESCRIPTION>
A conventional drip cup may be provided to collect 
rainwater dripping down or drained from an umbrella 
cloth of a wet umbrella. Such a drip cup is connected 
with a telescopic umbrella cover comprising a plurality 
of cylindrical elements of diameters which gradually 
decrease towards a tip portion of the umbrella. When 
extended, the cylindrical elements shield a wet umbrella 
to prevent water dripping or contamination to the 
surroundings, but when retracted, the umbrella may be 
opened for use. The telescopic mechanism and drain cup 
is complex and may cause inconvenience in operation and 
high production cost. In addition, the collecting cup 
should be operated to decant the accumulated water, 
increasing its inconvenience, otherwise the water may be 
accidentally spilled or may drain outwardly to moisten 
or contaminate the surroundings, possibly causing 
hygiene problems. The present invention provides a water collector for an 
umbrella as defined in the Claims.  The following description and the accompanying drawings 
referred to therein are included by way of non-limiting 
example in order to illustrate how the invention may be 
put into practice. In the drawings: Figure 1 is an exploded view showing the 
elements of the present invention. Figure 2 is an illustration showing an 
assembled water collector of the present 
invention fitted on an umbrella tip portion 
for collecting rainwater from a wet umbrella 
cloth. Figure 3 shows an opened umbrella when 
inverted from Fig. 2 for shielding use. Figure 4 shows a squeezing operation for 
removing rainwater absorbed in the water 
collector of the present invention when 
opening the umbrella. The water collector comprises a catcher member 1, an 
absorbent lining 2 secured on an inner surface 10 of the 
catcher member 1, a web member 3 secured on an outer 
surface 10a of the catcher member 1, and a retainer 4 
fitted in a central portion of the catcher member 1 for 
securing the water collector on a tip portion 51 of an  
 
umbrella 5, especially on a junction portion 53 of the 
umbrella 5 between the tip portion 51 and an umbrella 
cloth 52. The catcher member 1 is made of elastomer materials such 
as plastic materials having good elasticity and is 
generally formed in a conical, semi-spherical or cup-like 
shape, concave downwardly when mounted on an 
umbrella tip portion 51 facing downwardly. The catcher 
member includes a collar portion 11 formed on a central 
portion of the catcher member 1, a central hole 12 
formed through the collar portion

<CLAIMS>
A water collector for an umbrella, comprising: 

a catcher member (1) formed of resilient material and 
arranged to be secured on a tip portion of an umbrella 

by retainer means (4) provided in a central portion of 
said catcher member; 
an absorbent lining (2) formed of water-absorbing 
material and secured on an inner surface of said catcher 

member; and 
a flexible web member (3) circumferentially disposed 
about and secured on an outer surface of said catcher 

member; 
 
   whereby upon opening of an umbrella having 

rainwater previously drained and collected in said 
catcher member and absorbed by said absorbent lining, 

said absorbent lining will be squeezed in between the 
opened umbrella and said catcher member to remove said 

water absorbed therein. 
A water collector according to Claim 1, 
wherein said catcher member (1) is formed of resilient 

material and is concave downwardly when mounted on an 
umbrella with its tip portion facing downwardly, and 

said catcher member includes a plurality of resilient 
arms (13) radially protruding upwardly arcuately from a 

central portion of said catcher member to form a general 

cup shape, and a plurality of radial slots (14) formed 
in the catcher member, each said slot separating two 

neighbouring resilient arms. 
A water collector according to Claim 1 or 2, 
in which said catcher member (1) includes a collar 

portion (11) formed on a central portion of the catcher 
member, and a central hole (12) formed through the 

collar portion for receiving said the tip portion of the 
umbrella. 
A water collector according to any preceding 
claim, wherein said absorbent lining (2) is formed of 

flexible water-absorbing material and includes a 
plurality of absorbing sectors (23) radially disposed 

around a central portion (21) by forming a plurality of 
radial slits (24) in the lining, each said radial slit 

separating two neighbouring absorbing sectors, with all 
said absorbing sectors secured to an inner surface of 

said catcher member. 
A water collector according to any preceding 
claim, wherein said absorbent lining (2) includes a 

central base portion (21) secured to a central portion 
of the catcher member, and a central hole (22) formed 

through the absorbent lining to receive the tip portion 
of the umbrella. 
A water collector according to any preceding 
claim, wherein said web member (3) is formed of flexible 

thin elastomeric material and is secured to an outer 
portion of the catcher member by securing each said 

resilient arm of the catcher member to an inner surface 
of the web member. 
A water collector according to any preceding 
claim, in which said web member (3) has a central hole 

 
(31) formed in a central portion of the web member to 

receive the tip portion of the umbrella. 
A water collector according to Claim 3, 
wherein said retainer means (4) includes a cylindrical 

sleeve (40) having a central sleeve hole (41) engageable 
with a tip portion of the umbrella with the sleeve 

engaged in the central hole of the collar portion of the 
catcher member for securing the retainer means and the 

catcher member on the tip portion of the umbrella. 
A water collector according to Claim 8, 
wherein said cylindrical sleeve (40) of the retainer 

means has a notch (42) in a cylindrical wall of the 
sleeve for resiliently clamping the retainer means on 

the tip portion of the umbrella. 
A water collector according to Claim 3, 
wherein said retainer means (4) is integrally formed
