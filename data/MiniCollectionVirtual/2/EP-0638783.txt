<ABSTRACT>
A rotation rate sensor which uses a double ended tuning fork 
having a mounting base with only a single exclusive mounting 

surface. The mounting base is surrounded and centrally 
disposed within the body of the tuning fork. The mounting 

base is joined to the body by a suspension system which is 
also disposed within the body of the tuning fork. The tuning 

fork is mounted in the housing only at the single exclusive 
mounting surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to rotation rate
sensors which employ double ended (i.e., H-shaped) tuning
forks formed from piezoelectric materials. In particular,
it pertains to an improvement for mounting a double ended
tuning fork in the housing of a rotation rate sensor.There are two current approaches for mounting a double ended
tuning fork in a sensor housing. Both approaches require the
tuning fork to have bridges externally joined to the tuning
fork body on opposite sides of the body. In the first
approach, each bridge has a mounting surface which is secured
to the sensor housing. In the second approach, the bridges
are joined to a frame which surrounds the tuning fork and
has multiple mounting surfaces for securing the frame to the
sensor housing. Since the bridges in the first approach and
the bridges and the frame in the second approach are
integrally joined to the tuning fork, the mounting surfaces
in both approaches are of the same piezoelectric material
as the tuning fork. A problem associated with these approaches is that the
coefficients of thermal expansion of the piezoelectric
material of the mounting surfaces and the housing material
are mismatched at the mounting points. Thus, as the operating
temperature of the rotation rate sensor varies, strains are
imparted on the tuning fork due to the mismatched expansion
or contraction of the piezoelectric material and the housing
materials. As a result, the frequencies of the drive, pickup,
and other modes will vary substantially from the desired
frequencies of these modes. In order to match the thermal
coefficients of expansion as close as possible, the housing
material to which the piezoelectric material of the mounting
surfaces are mounted is typically limited to the Nickel Alloy
Monel 400.The described multiple mounting surface approaches have
another significant problem. The tuning forks of these
approaches have a number of modes of vibration which have
frequencies below 2,500 Hz. As a result, these modes can be
easily induced by common external vibrations.Still another problem associated with the multiple mounting
surface approaches involves the number of tuning forks which
can be produced from a single wafer of piezoelectric
material. The tuning forks of the first approach described
have a large area due to the fact that bridges are externally
joined to opposite sides of the tuning fork body. Moreover,
the tuning forks of the second approach described have even
a larger area in that external bridges and a surrounding
frame are
