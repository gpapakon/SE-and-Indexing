liquid from discharge ports comprises an elemental base 

board (1) having on it elements (2) for generating discharge 
energy to discharge a liquid, and a head having a 

discharge port member (4) with a plurality of the discharge 
ports arranged therefor, which constitutes a plurality 

of liquid passages (3) by being pressed to be in close 
contact with the surface of the elemental base board (1) on 

the side where the elements (2) for generating discharge 
energy are arranged. This discharge port member (4) is 

provided with an extension (8) which is extendedly present 
to the reverse side of the aforesaid surface, and also, 

provided with biasing means (6) for pressing the discharge 
port member to be in close contact with the aforesaid 

surface by exerting a biasing force on the extension.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid jet head, a
liquid jet head cartridge, and a liquid jet apparatus.
More particularly, the invention relates to a liquid
jet head formed by joining a discharge port member with
an elemental base board having the elements on it for
generating discharge energy for discharging liquid, a
liquid jet head cartridge and a liquid jet apparatus
which use such liquid jet head.As an ink jet recording head, there have hitherto
been used, among others, a head which adopts
piezoelectric elements as those generating discharge
energy to creation pressure changes in the ink passages
for discharging ink droplets by the utilization of the
distortion of the piezoelectric elements, and a head
which uses heat generating elements arranged in ink
passages to create air bubbles by heating ink rapidly
for discharging ink droplets. Of these heads, the so-called
bubble jet recording head, wherein ink is
discharged by heating it rapidly by use of the elements
for generating heat, can be structured simply to make
it possible to arrange many numbers of nozzles in a
high density. Advantageously, therefore, this method 
enables a high speed recording in a high precision.As a method of manufacturing the bubble jet
recording head having many nozzles integrally formed in
it, a heater board is prepared by arranging a thinly
filmed heater and its wiring on the surface of a plate
made of silicon or the like, and using it as the base
board, a dry film is bonded on it. Then, after
exposure and development, a ceiling board made of glass
or the like is joined to it, and the discharge port
unit is produced by cutting the integrated body thus
fabricated. Also, there is, among others, a method in
which the nozzle pattern is formed on the base board by
use of a photosensitive resin. After covering it with
resin, the integrated body thus prepared is cut to form
the discharge port unit, and then, the photosensitive
resin is removed for the formation of a head. Further,
a method is adopted to make a discharge port member, in
which grooved nozzles and discharge ports are formed by
resin, and then, to press this member to be in contact
with a base board to fabricate a head. It is widely
used because the nozzles of a complicated configuration
can be fabricated at a lower cost in accordance with
this method. The method is remarkably superior and
suitably applicable to its production on a large scale.
This method is disclosed in the specification of
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2-192954.As a structure to supply
