<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid crystal display, the driving ICs through which to access the display are mounted on sheets by 
the COG assembling. The external junctions (12 and 13) are arranged in a direction substantially rectangular to the 

direction of the display (5), when observing from the IC mounting parts (8 and 9), so that external lines (14 and 15) 
are connected to the input electrodes (10 and 11) which are connected to the input terminals of the driving ICs (6 

and 7). In this way, the lengths (a and b) of the flange of the sheets (1 and 2) can be decreased to reduce the outer 
dimensions of the liquid crystal display by 20 % or more. Also, the expected numbers of the displays per unit area of 

sheet material can he increased by 50 % or more. Further, in the manufacture of liquid crystal displays of an active 
matrix type using an anode oxidation method, there is no need for cutting off the parts of the common electrodes 

for the anode oxidation. No steps are required to cut apart such parts. The manufacturing processes are simplified 
accordingly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display, particularly
to that comprising semiconductor integrated circuits (referred to as
"driver ICs" in this specification) directly mounted on substrates for
driving a display portion.A liquid crystal display is widely used in a liquid crystal TV, a video
camera, a personal computer, a word processor, an electronic desk
calculator, and other various information processing devices.Particularly, a so-called COG (chip-on-glass) mounting method,
i.e., a method of directly mounting the driver ICs for driving the display
portion on substrates such as glass substrates is making a progress in
commercial use since the mounting portion is very compact in size and
low in mounting cost in this method.Fig. 3 is a plan view of a conventional liquid crystal display which
employs the COG mounting method. As illustrated in the figure, the
liquid crystal display is equipped with a first and a second substrates 1
and 2, on which driving electrodes 3 and driving electrodes 4 are formed
respectively.A display portion 5 in which liquid crystal is encapsulated is
accessed by way of the driving electrodes 3 and 4.Driver ICs 6 and 7 mounted on the first and second substrates 1 and
2 are directly mounted (COG mounting) on the first and second substrates 
1 and 2 in areas of IC mounting portions 8 and 9 respectively. The driving
electrodes 3 and 4 are connected to output terminals 42 and output
terminals 43 of the driver ICs 6 and 7 respectively.Moreover, input electrodes 30 and input electrodes 31 are formed on
the first and second substrates 1 and 2 respectively, and the input
electrodes 30 and 31 are connected to the input terminals 40 and input
terminals 41 of the driver ICs 6 and 7 respectively.The input electrodes 30 and input 31 set forth above are connected to
external wirings 34 and 35 in areas of outward connecting portions 32 and
33 respectively for supplying signals or voltages to the liquid crystal
display from outside.The feature of such a conventional liquid crystal display is that the
outward connecting portions 32 and 33 are disposed in areas in directions
reverse to those of the display portion 5 viewed from the mounting portions
8 and 9 indicated by arrows 16 and 17 respectively, i.e., in areas in
directions indicated by arrows 38 and 39 as illustrated in Fig. 3.A liquid crystal display of high quality employs active matrix
system in which each pixel constituting the display portion is directly
controlled by a switching element.As representative switching
