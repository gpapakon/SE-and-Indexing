<ABSTRACT>
A pedal crank drive for a bicycle has a shaft (3) which extends through a bearing housing (4), a chain wheel (8) with at least one toothed ring (9) and whose hub (7) is rotary held relative to the shaft (3), and a force transmission spring (10) arranged inside the bearing housing (4) and supported on the one side on the shaft (3) and on the other side on the hub (7) of the chain wheel (8). In order to achieve an advantageous design, the force transmission spring (10) consists of spring elements (11) distributed around the circumference of the shaft (3) and supported on the hub (7) of the chain wheel (8) and on the shaft (3).

A pedal drive for a bicycle comprising a shaft
(3) extending through a bearing casing (4), a chain

wheel (8) having at least one toothed rim (9) and a
hub (7) held rotatably relative to the shaft (3),

and a power-transmitting spring (10) disposed inside
the bearing casing (4) and abutting the shaft (3) at

one end and the hub (7) of the chain wheel (8) at
the other end, characterised in that the power-transmitting

spring (10) is made up of spring
elements (11) distributed around the periphery of

the shaft (3) and each abutting the shaft (3) and
the hub (7) of the chain wheel (8).
A pedal drive according to claim 1,
characterised in that the elements (11) of the

power-transmitting spring (10) comprise spring rods
extending in the direction of the shaft.
A pedal drive according to claim 2,
characterised in that the spring rods are connected

to bearing rings at the ends.
A pedal drive according to claim 2,
characterised in that the spring rods are in the

form of bending rods clamped at one end whereas the
end remote from the clamped end is pivotably held.
A pedal drive according to claim 1,
characterised in that the shaft (3) has peripherally 

distributed toothed extensions (21) projecting
towards the hub (7) of the chain wheel (8) and

engaging in gaps between toothed extensions (22) on
the hub (7), and in that the spring elements (11)

are disposed between the toothed interlocking
extensions (21, 22) of the shaft (3) and of the hub

(7).
A pedal drive according to any of claims 1 to
5, characterised in that the angle of rotation

between the shaft (3) and the hub (7) of the chain
wheel (8) is bounded by stops (19, 20).
A pedal drive according to any of claims 1 to
6, characterised in that the hub (7) of the chain

wheel (8) is mounted for rotation in the bearing
casing (4) for the shaft (3).
A pedal drive according to any of claims 1 to
7, characterised in that a damping spring (14)

prestressed in the loading direction of the power-transmitting
spring (10) is operative between the

shaft (3) and the hub (7) of the chain wheel (8).
A pedal drive according to claim 8,
characterised in that in addition to the power-transmitting

spring (10), the damping spring (14) is
also disposed in the bearing casing (4) of the shaft

(3).
