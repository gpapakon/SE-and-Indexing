<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a CNC provided with an autonomous function as one of the constituent elements of an FA system, 
etc., using a host computer as the primary constituent. A CNC system (2A) comprises a CNC board (21), a PMC board (22) 

and a communication board (24), and plays the role of a machining cell in the FA system inclusive of a machine tool (23). The 
PMC board (22) receives a request indicated by the FA computer through a LAN (11) and the communication board (24), and 

executes suitable processing for the machine tool (23). It sends the processing result back to the FA computer through the communication 
board (24). Further, the PMC board (22) is provided with instruction means (22A). The instruction means (22A) 

makes suitable judgement in accordance with the condition of the machine tool (23) on the basis of various data sent from the 
machine tool (23), and requests suitable processings required to the FA computer, the PLC and other CNC system. The instruction 

means also makes suitable judgement on the basis of data from units other than itself, and requests necessary processings to 
the FA computer, the PLC and other CNC system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a numerical control 
apparatus, and more specifically, to a numerical control 
apparatus serving as a component of a factory automation 
system (hereinafter, referred to as a FA system) and the 
like having a host computer serving as the central unit of 
the system. Conventionally, in a network environment such as a 
FA system having a host computer serving as the central 
unit of the system, a numerical control apparatus (hereinafter, 
referred to as a CNC) has a role only as a sever. More specifically, the CNC has only such a passive 
role that it carries out a proper process in accordance 
with a request instructed from the host computer and returns 
the result of the process to the host computer again. Nevertheless, in the today's highly sophisticated 
network environment, the CNC is further required to make a 
proper decision by itself in accordance with the state of 
machine tools surrounding it and instruct the host computer 
and other programmable controllers and CNCs to take necessary 
measures in addition to the above passive role. That  
 
is, the CNC is required to have an autonomous function. Taking the above into consideration, an object of 
the present invention is to provide a CNC as a component of 
a network with an autonomous function. To solve the above problem, according to the present 
invention, there is provided a numerical control apparatus 
serving as a component of a FA system and the like having a 
host computer for controlling the system, which comprises 
instruction means provided for a programmable controller 
for controlling the operation of a machine tool to instruct 
to other components to carry out a process which is determined 
necessary as a result that the state of the machine 
tool or the state of the other components is monitored. The instruction means is provided for the programmable 
controller of the numerical control apparatus so that 
the instruction means instructs the other components to 
carry out a process which is determined necessary as a 
result that the state of the machine tool or the state of 
the other components is monitored. As a result, the numerical 
control apparatus can be provided with a function for 
requiring the other components to carry out a necessary 
process. Therefore, the numerical control apparatus which 
conventionally has a role only as a server can be arranged 
as an autonomous type.  FIG. 1 is a diagram showing an arrangement of a 
numerical control apparatus (CNC system) of the present 
invention
