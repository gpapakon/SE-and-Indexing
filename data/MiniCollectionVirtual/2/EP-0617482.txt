<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a mains cable plug connection for electrical appliances and electrical tools, the plug which is connected to the electrical cable consists of two plug part halves which are connected to one another and on which latching vanes, which are flexible in an elastically resilient manner, are fastened from the outside by means of a common screw union, which latching vanes secure the plug in a positively locking manner by means of latching shoulders on both sides in the interior of a retaining socket into which it is inserted, with the aid of latching shoulders which engage behind corresponding locking recesses in the retaining socket.

A mains-cable plug-in connexion for electrical appliances and tools, in particular for
electrical hand tools, with a plug with a cable and an associated receiving socket with a

configuration complementary to the plug, wherein external, mutually opposed resilient
catching wings (13a, 13b) on both sides are provided on the plug (10), the said catching

wings (13a, 13b) engaging - in the state inserted into the receiving socket and spread resiliently
apart - with catching shoulders (40) behind corresponding locking recesses (41) in

the interior of the associated receiving socket (30) and forming gripping areas which can
be compressed by being pressed in, as a result of which the catching shoulders (40) are

released from the locking recesses in the receiving socket.
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the catching
wings (13a, 13b) are attached to the outside of the plug (10) and are screwed to each

other as a result of the fact that a common screw passes through a through-bore in the
front part of the plug as well as through the two catching wings.
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the plug
comprises two halves (11, 12) which are approximately similar and which are connected

to each other in their interior while receiving the electrical contact connexions and form
front receiving pockets open towards the front for attachments (15) of the two catching

wings (13a, 13b), wherein the connecting screw (39) of the catching wings (13a, 13b) is
guided between the openings (43) for the electrical receiving female contacts (19a, 19b).
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 the catching wings (13a, 13b) are pre-stressed outwards by a common compression
spring (24) which passes through a through-bore (23) in the two halves (11, 12) of the

plug and which is mounted in the said through-bore (23).
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
that
 the catching wings (13a, 13b) form gripping faces (42) which are mutually opposed
on the plug (
10) towards the rear and in the region of which the catching shoulders (40)
are arranged on both sides with respect to each gripping face.
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
that
 in order to facilitate assembly on one of the attachments (15a) - extending at right 
angles to the main part of each catching wing - of one catching wing (13a) a non-circular

prolongation of material extends as far as the region of the opposite attachment (15b) of
the other catching wing (13b), and is received in a non-circular through bore (38) formed

by the two halves of the plug which are connected to each other.
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in
that
 the halves (11, 12) of the plug are fixed in position with respect to each other by
respective rib-like projections (21) and correspondingly associated recesses (22) in the

respective other part, wherein a tubular projection starts approximately centrally from one
of the halves (11) of the plug, a further tubular projection on the other half (12) of the

plug engaging in the said tubular projection, in order to form the through- and bearing
bore (23) passing through the two parts of the plug for the common pre-stressing spring

(24) of the two catching wings.
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in
that
 the two halves (11, 12) of the main plug are screwed to each other by through-bores
arranged on both sides of the received end (32) of the electric cable in order to clamp the

cable end tightly at the same time, wherein a cable support sleeve (17) is received in an
annular recess, half formed by each of the two halves of the plug, and the assembly of the

plug is completed in the front region by the middle screw (39) which at the same time
fixes the two catching wings (13a, 13b) on both sides.
A mains-cable plug-in connexion according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in
that
 metallic receiving female contacts (19a, 19b) forming blade contacts are inserted in
receiving spaces formed by housing projections in one of the halves (11) of the plug,

wherein the corresponding receiving socket (30) is provided on the respective electrical
appliance with projecting tongues (29) which are received by partial contact faces (28) of

each receiving socket pressed resiliently against each other and are resiliently spread apart
at the same time.
