<ABSTRACT>
Microspherical cogel particles comprising silica and at least one other metal oxide are prepared by forming a slurry of porous particulate material comprising silica and a liquid medium comprising at least 90 %, by weight of the liquid medium, of an organic liquid and subjecting the slurry to spray drying. The method enables agglomeration of particulate material of especially small particle size to obtain microspherical particles of a size especially suitable for us as a catalyst support. The particles have a pore size of at least 2 cc/g and, especially when the particles contain titanium atoms, are especially suitable for use in the preparation of a catalyst for the polymerisation of olefins.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CATALYSTS AND CATALYST SUPPORTSThis invention relates to catalysts and catalyst supports, particularly for the polymerization of olefins, especially ethylene. It is well-known that catalysts comprising a silica gel support and containing chromium are useful in the polymerization of olefins. The nature of the resulting polymer is highly dependent upon that of the catalyst, so that variations in the characteristics of the catalyst will cause variations in, for example, the molecular weight, melt index, bulk density, particle shape, particle size, particle size distribution and reaction temperature which may be employed to effect polymerization. Furthermore, the nature of the catalyst is highly dependent upon its method of preparation. By way of example, reference is made to US-A- 3887494, which describes the preparation of a silica- containing composition which is catalytically active for olefin polymerization and which comprises the following steps, namely (a) adding a titanium compound to a mineral acid (titanium is known to increase the melt index, this reflecting a lower molecular weight of the resulting polymer), (b) introducing an alkali metal silicate into the acid containing the titanium compound to form a hydrogel, (c) ageing the hydrogel for a period greater than one hour (this ageing step considerably increases the strength of the resulting catalyst) , (d) 

thereafter washing the hydrogel to remove alkali metal ions, thus leaving the hydrogel in an aqueous medium, (e) removing the water from the washed hydrogel using an organic liquid which is both water soluble and contains oxygen (the methods of repeated washing and azeotropic distillation are mentioned specifically), (f) removing the organic compound and any remaining water to form a xerogel, (g) incorporating chromium into the composition, for example, as an aqueous solution added to the mineral acid with step (a) or in an organic solvent medium impregnated into the composition immediately after drying by step (f), and (h) calcining the xerogel from step (f) at 480°-980°C to obtain the desired composition. Variations of this process are described in US-A-3867306, US-A-3900457, US-A-4424320 and US-A-4053436.In order to provide a polymer having a high melt index, a broader molecular weight distribution and increased bulk density, EP-A-0352715 describes a variation in the above process in which the cogel produced by steps (a) and (b) of US-A-3887494 is prepared under neutral conditions, then aged under neutral conditions and thereafter
