<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement with at least two subscribers (10, 11) which can be connected via interfaces (13, 14) is proposed, at least one input element (17) which responds to an output contained in a second subscriber (11) being contained in a first subscriber (10). The output (23) controls for example an electric motor (30), provided in an adjustment drive (35), in a prescribed direction of rotation. In order to increase the operational reliability, a redundant line (22) leads from the input (17) directly to the output (23), bypassing the interfaces (13, 14). The arrangement according to the invention is particularly suitable for use in a multiplex system which is arranged in a motor vehicle, the operational reliability, for example of a window lifting drive, being improved.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement having at least two
subscribers (10, 11) which can be connected via

interfaces (13, 14), having a subscriber (10) which
contains at least one input element (17, 18) which, via

the interfaces (13, 14) and a data line (12), addresses
at least one output (23, 24) which is contained in

another subscriber (11), characterized in that the
input element (17) is connected directly to the

output (23) in the other subscriber (11), bypassing the
interfaces (13, 14) and the data line (12) via a

redundant line (22), in such a manner that it is
possible to actuate a safety-relevant function

directly, bypassing the data line (12), in which case
the actuation via the redundant line (22) and the data

line (12) is mutually decoupled.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the redundant line (22) is an optical

conductor.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the redundant line (22) is an electrical line.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the input element (17) is a manually operable

switch (19).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the output (23) operates a relay (27).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the output (23) contains an OR logic

device (26, 28), which logically links the information 
transmitted via the redundant line (22) and via the

data line (12) which links the two subscribers (10,
11).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the second subscriber (11) controls a

positioning drive (35) which is preferably arranged in
a motor vehicle and can be operated by an electric

motor (30).
Arrangement according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the signal which is transmitted via the

redundant line (22) causes the electric motor (30) to
rotate in a specific, predetermined direction.
Arrangement according to Claims 7 and 8,
characterized in that the positioning drive (35) is a

window winder, and in that the predetermined rotation
direction of the electric motor (30) corresponds to a

process for opening the window.
