<ABSTRACT>
A compound of formula (1) wherein Ph1, Ph2, and Ph3 are each a phenyl group optionally substituted with a combination of up to three members of the group consisting of fluoro, chloro, bromo, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, NH2, N(CH3)2, (C1-4)alkyl and (C1-4)alkoxy or the phenyl group can be substituted with a methylenedioxy group; n is an integer of from 1 to 5; m is 0 or an integer of from 1 to 2; and q is an integer of from 1 to 2; or an acid addition salt thereof, which reverse multidrug resistance in multidrug resistant tumor cells and are thus useful adjuvants in the treatment of tumors. These compounds apparently function by inhibiting a p-glycoprotein pump which becomes activated in late stage tumor development and which is inherently present in tumors from certain origins.

<DESCRIPTION>
Effective tumor treatment is frequently thwarted by the
lack of sensitivity of certain tumors to standard
chemotherapeutic agents (intrinsic resistance) or by the
ability of certain tumors to develop a lack of
chemotherapeutic sensitivity during the course of treatment
(acquired or extrinsic resistance). The cause of these
phenomena has been linked to the existence of an energy-dependent
efflux pump which acts to remove the
chemotherapeutic agent from the target cell. The pump
consists of the P-glycoprotein found as a constituent of
cell membrane, and it has been suggested that the normal
function of the P-glycoprotein is to remove toxins from
within the cell. This theory is supported by the
observation that P-glycoprotein is found as a cell membrane
constituent in cells such as liver, kidney, colon, and
jejunum. It has been suggested that P-glycoprotein in the
cell membrane of such normal tissues could act to remove
toxins or to assist in the transport of nutrients and
solutes and in secreting a variety of protein and steroid
substances. Natural presence of P-glycoprotein in tumor
cells derived from these tissues as well as its presence in
tumor cells derived from other tissue types could explain,
at least in part, resistance of various tumors to therapy
with standard chemotherapeutic agents. Disubstituted piperidine and pyrrolidine derivatives
have already been disclosed in the art. In this respect,
reference may be made to the following documents:
WO 91/10651 which relates to certain disubstituted
piperidine and pyrrolidine derivatives useful as
selective muscarinic receptor antagonists;EP-A2-0235463 which relates to certain N-substituted
arylalkyl and arylalkylenepyrrolidines,
piperidines and homopiperidines useful in methods
of treating cardiovascular dysfunctions, countering
the effects of histamine in allergies and
countering gastric secretion excesses;FR-A1-188403 which relates to certain disubstituted
piperidine derivatives;Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica, vol. 19, 671-675 (1984) which
relates to the synthesis of 2',2'-diphenylethylazacycloalkane
derivatives and their
uses as anticholinergics.There are also many multidrug resistance reversing
agents and anti-neoplastic enhancing agents known in the
art. Hence, reference may be made to the following
documents:
WO-A-90/15599 which relates to the use of certain
aryl-substituted amine derivatives as adjuvant
chemotherapy for neoplasias resistant to multiple
drugs;EP-A3-0467435 which relates to the use of certain
benzylhydryl derivatives useful for the
