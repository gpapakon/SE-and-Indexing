<ABSTRACT>
A pallet truck has a rigid frame mounting 
a plurality of load cells. Ball and socket coupling 

devices are connected to the load cells and support 
a platform assembly. The frame and platform 

assembly are able to be elevated to lift and support 
an object to be weighed on the platform assembly. 

The ball and socket coupling devices enable the 
platform assembly to shift laterally to dissipate 

lateral forces and then restore the platform 
assembly to a position wherein the weight of the 

object is transmitted along associated load axes of 
the load cells for accurately measuring the weight 

of the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
lift truck apparatus for lifting and weighing an object
and having a plurality of laterally spaced forks
(EP-A2-177 891).Devices suitable for weighing large, heavy
objects, such as tote containers of the type used
for the storage and handling of liquid chemicals in
bulk, have been, for the most part, limited to
stationary floor scales of 5,000 pounds (2270 kg) or more
weighing capacity. Not all facilities that utilize
tote containers are equipped with such floor scales
and for those that are it is not always convenient
or practical to transport the containers to and from
the floor scales for weighing.Some of the prior lift trucks include
weighing devices wherein objects, such as tote
containers, can be lifted by the trucks and weighed.
The accuracy of the weighing apparatus of such
lifting trucks is, at best, about 98%. The contents
of a typical container weigh about 5,000 pounds (2270 kg),
equating to a weighing error of known apparatus of
plus or minus 100 pounds (45 kg). One reason for the
relatively high error of prior art apparatus is
believed to be lateral loading of the load sensors
caused by shifting of the container's contents,
uneven flooring, and the like which produces a false 
reading of the weight of the container and its
contents.An object of this invention is to improve
the accuracy of such lift truck weighing apparatus which object is solved with claim 1.A presently preferred embodiment of the
invention is illustrated in the accompanying
drawings, wherein: 
Figure 1 is a fragmentary side elevational
view of the lift truck apparatus illustrating the
lifting apparatus in its lowered position;Figure 2 is a view like Figure 1 but with
the lifting apparatus shown in an elevated position;Figure 3 is a top view of the apparatus
shown with the weigh deck and fork covers removed;Figure 4 is a view like Figure 3 but with
the fork covers and weigh deck installed;Figure 5 is an enlarged, sectional view
taken along the line 5-5 of Figure 4; andFigure 6 is an enlarged sectional view of
the ball and socket coupling device taken along the
line 6-6 of Figure 5.Lift truck weighing apparatus constructed
according to a presently preferred embodiment of the
invention is indicated generally by the reference
numeral 10 and comprises a pallet lifting truck of
conventional construction including a rigid frame 12
having a base 14 mounting a pair of steerable rear
wheels 16 and a pair of laterally spaced forks 18,
20 each of which project forwardly of the base
portion 14 and mounts a

<CLAIMS>
Lift truck appparatus (10) for lifting and weighing an
object (63), said apparatus comprising:


a) a wheeled frame (12) having a plurality of laterally
spaced forks (18, 20);
b) a weighing platform assembly (60) for supporting an
object, such as a tote container, and including a

bottom portion (88, 90, 92), overlying the
associated forks (18, 20), and a rigid weigh deck

(98) of an open frame construction supported
separately on said bottem portion (88, 92), said

platform assembly (60) extending laterally between
said forks (18, 20);
c) lift means (30) for elevating said frame (12) and
said platform assembly (60) to lift and support an

object (63) on said platform assembly (60);
d) a plurality of load sensors (54) supported by said
forks (18, 20) at spaced apart locations, each

having a loading axis (A) along which the weight of
an object (63) is to be applied for accurately

measuring its weight; and
e) a plurality of load-aligning coupling devices (62),
corresponding in number and spacing to said load

sensors (54) each coupled to an adjacent one of said
load sensors (54) for normally supporting said

platform assembly (60) in an aligned position with
respect to said loading axis (A), wherein the weight

of the object (63) is transmitted to said load 
sensors (54) along said loading axis (A), while

enabling said platform assembly (60) to oscillate
laterally in a plurality of directions relative to

said loading axis (A) to dissipate lateral forces
acting on the object (63) and self-restore said

platform assembly (60) to said aligned position for
measuring the weight of the object (63), said

platform assembly (60) transfers loads applied to
the platform assembly (60) between said spaced forks

(18, 20) axially to said load sensors (54) via said
