<ABSTRACT>
An information distribution system (600) is disclosed having a primary context
presentation arrangement (MCP 2) comprising (first) multimedia presentation means

(602) configured for presentation of primary information content (614, 618) to a proximal
audience of plural persons (616, 622) and (first) processor means (64) for providing the

primary information content (614, 618) to the first multimedia presentation means (602)
and for associating secondary information content (610, 612, 620) with the primary

information content. The secondary information content is constrained to a context of the
primary information content. At least one portable presentation arrangement (PMV 3) is

also provided and comprising (second) multimedia presentation means (604) and (second)
processor means (64). The portable presentation arrangement is operable by a user (616,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the generation of multimedia contents in output
devices and, in particular, to a system which permits a plurality of users to access
information derived from a context related source but to individually traverse information
related to that context.The traditional technique of obtaining additional information corresponding to a
multimedia context is through the exploration of embedded hyperlinks. However,
traditional systems for hyperlinked content presentation suffer from many limitations. For
example, after traversing several layers of hyperlinks, users tend to lose track of the main
context which was the initial focus of attention and which instigated the traversal of the
hyperlinks in the first place. Further, in multiuser scenarios, all users are constrained to
be presented with the same hyperlinked information at any one time. There is therefore a
need to hold the multimedia context in perspective while this context relevant
additional/hyperlinked information is explored independently by individual users, who are
simultaneous consumers of the multimedia context.It is a concern of the present invention to substantially overcome, or at least
ameliorate, at least some problems associated with the prior art.A proposed solution to these problems results in the process of independent
consumer access to embedded hyperlinked content under the simultaneous generation of a
main multimedia context.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a
method of providing information to a plurality of users, the method including the steps of:
(a) reproducing audio and/or visual data having predetermined contents on a
first reproduction means;(b) receiving input from at least one of said plurality of users and providing
user data in response to said input, said user data being associated with at least part of said
predetermined contents; and(c) reproducing on at least one second reproduction means said user data to
at least said user.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a system
for providing information to a plurality of users, said system including: an information source having a first reproduction means for reproducing (first)
media data having predetermined contents simultaneously to a plurality of users,at least one information destination operable by one of said users and having a
second reproduction means and a user input, said information destination being operable
via said user input to select at least part of
