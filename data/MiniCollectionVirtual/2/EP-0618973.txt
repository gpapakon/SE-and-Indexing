<ABSTRACT>
Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) variants with substitution of leucine for phenylalanine, histidine for arginine, serine for isoleucine and threonine for lysine at amino acid positions (274, 275, 276 and 277) respectively, of wild-type human t-PA are prepared. DNA sequences can be prepared that encode such variants, as well as expression vectors incorporating the DNA sequences, and host cells transformed with the expression vectors. The variants exhibit improved fibrin-specificity and can be used in a pharmaceutical preparation to treat a vascular disease or condition or to prevent fibrin deposition or adhesion formation or reformation in mammals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) variants, to methods 
for preparing these variants, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. Plasminogen activators are enzymes that cleave the peptide bond of plasminogen 
between amino acid residues 561 and 562, converting it to plasmin. Plasmin is an active 
serine proteinase that degrades various proteins including fibrin. Several plasminogen 
activators have been identified including streptokinase (a bacterial protein), urokinase 
(synthesized in the kidney and elsewhere and originally extracted from urine), and human 
tissue plasminogen activator, termed t-PA (produced by the cells lining blood vessel walls). The mode of action of each of these plasminogen activators is somewhat different. 
Streptokinase forms a complex with plasminogen or plasmin generating plasminogen-activating 
activity, urokinase cleaves plasminogen directly, and t-PA interacts with both 
plasminogen and fibrin for optimal activity. T-PA is an anomalous serine protease in that although its single chain form is less 
active towards low molecular weight substrates and inhibitors, in the presence of fibrin it is 
not a true zymogen but displays a plasminogen activator activity similar to that of two chain 
t-PA [Rijken et al., J. Biol. Chem.257, 2920-5 (1982); Lijnen et al., Thromb. Haemost. 64, 
61-8 (1990)]. Wild-type t-PA is a poor enzyme in the absence of fibrin, but the presence of 
fibrin strikingly enhances its ability to activate plasminogen. Without stimulation, the 
catalytic efficiency (catalytic rate constant (kcat)/Michaelis constant (Km)) of melanoma or 
recombinant t-PA (Activase®) for the activation of plasminogen is approximately 0.001 µM 
1sec-1, whereas in the presence of fibrin or fibrin degradation products, this efficiency 
(pseudo-rate constant) is increased by about 1500-fold. Due in part to its high fibrin specificity and potent ability to dissolve blood clots invivo, 
t-PA has been identified as an important new biological pharmaceutical for treating vascular 
diseases such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism. A substantially pure form of t-PA was first produced from a natural source and tested 
for invivo activity by Collen et al., U.S. Patent Number 4,752,603 issued 21 June 1988 (see 
also Rijken et al., J. Biol. Chem., 256:7035 [1981]). Pennica et al. (Nature, 301:214 [1983]) 
determined the DNA sequence of t-PA and deduced the amino acid sequence from this DNA 
sequence (see U.S. Patent Number 4,766,075 issued 23
