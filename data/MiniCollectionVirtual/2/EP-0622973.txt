<ABSTRACT>
A heating apparatus such as a microwave oven (1) 
includes an outer casing (2) and an inner casing (3) 

enclosed in the outer casing (2). A heating chamber (4) is 
defined in the inner casing (3). A side wall (4c) of the 

inner casing (3) has a hole (15a) through which an 
ultrasonic wave from an ultrasonic transducer (18) passes so 

as to be transmitted to the food. The ultrasonic wave is 
reflected on the food to be received by the transducer (18), 

which generates a reception output. Configuration of the 
food is determined on the basis of the reception output of 

the transducer (18). A heating condition is determined on 
the basis of the determined configuration of the food. The 

diameter of the hole (15a) is set to be larger than the 
wavelength of the ultrasonic wave transmitted from the 

transducer (18) so that diffraction of the ultrasonic wave 
can be prevented when the wave passes through the hole 

(15a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heating apparatus provided
with an ultrasonic transducer transmitting an ultrasonic
wave into a heating chamber so that configuration of food
accommodated in the heating chamber is detected, and more
particularly to such a heating apparatus wherein the
ultrasonic wave is transmitted through a hole formed through
a wall of the heating chamber.U.S. Patent No. 4,868,357 granted to Serikawa et al.
discloses a microwave oven of the above-described type. In
the disclosed microwave oven, configuration of food placed
on a turntable in a heating chamber is detected by use of an
ultrasonic transducer mounted on a side wall of the heating
chamber. The result of detection of the food configuration
is used to control output of a magnetron with the result of
detection of a weight sensor detecting the weight of the
food, so that the output of the magnetron is rendered
suitable for the food.In the above-described microwave oven, the ultrasonic
transducer is mounted on the outer face of the side wall of
the heating chamber. The side wall has a hole formed
therethrough. An ultrasonic wave is transmitted through the
through-hole into the heating chamber with the turntable
carrying the food being turned. The ultrasonic wave
impinges on the food and the resultant echo wave is received
by the transducer. The configuration of the food is 
determined on the basis of the difference between the time
of transmission of the ultrasonic wave and the time of
reception of the echo wave.The ultrasonic wave undergoes diffraction as ordinary
sound waves do. The diffraction of the ultrasonic wave is
conspicuous when the diameter of a hole through which the
ultrasonic wave is transmitted as described above is
smaller than the wavelength of the ultrasonic wave. This is
shown in FIG. 7 wherein the ultrasonic wave transmitted
through a hole B from an ultrasonic transducer A is shown in
the form of compressional waves. In this case, the
diffraction damps, to a large extent, intensity of the
ultrasonic wave transmitted through the hole B into the
heating chamber. Consequently, a sufficient level of the
echo wave cannot be ensured when the ultrasonic wave
impinges on the food to be received by the transducer. Or,
the diffraction results in a condition that a sound source
is just as located in the hole B. In both cases, the error
in time difference characteristic of transmission and
reception of the ultrasonic transducer is amplified, which
deteriorates characteristic of detection output of the
ultrasonic transducer.
