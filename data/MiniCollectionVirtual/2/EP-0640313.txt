<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support (1) for bathtubs which is made of rigid foam plastic, for example of rigid polystyrene foam, and has a bottom part (4) which is preferably integrally foamed and in which two through-openings (5, 5') can be made. To achieve maximum variability but at the same time also as material-saving a construction as possible, the invention proposes that at least one through-opening is constructed as a partial through-opening (22, 23) and a partial bottom piece (22', 23') is provided or that two through-openings (5, 5') are made, one of which is closed by a bottom piece (6).
