<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN NOR TESTINGThe present invention relates to a method of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) testing of integral spin quantum number spin systems.NQR testing is used for detecting the presence or disposition of specific substances. It depends on the energy levels of quadrupolar nuclei, which have a spin quantum number greater than one-half. Quadrupolar nuclei having an integral spin quantum number (that is, I = 1, 2, 3 ...) include 14N(1=1). '^N nuclei are present in a wide range of substances, including animal tissue, bone, food-stuffs, explosives and drugs.In the sub-molecular environment of compounds or crystals, the nature and disposition of the electrons and atomic nuclei produce an electric field gradient which modifies the nuclear energy levels to such an extent that measurements of NQR effects can indicate not merely the nuclei which are present but also their chemical environment, thus indicating specific substances or types of substances in any tested sample. In NQR testing a sample is irradiated with pulses or sequences of pulses of radiofrequency electromagnetic waves having a frequency which is at or very close to a resonant frequency of quadrupolar nuclei in a substance which is to be detected. If the substance is present, the irradiant energy will raise at least some of the nuclei to a higher energy level. Such nuclei will tend to return to their normal state and in doing so they will emit radiation at their resonance frequency or frequencies which can be detected as a free induction decay (f.i.d.) during a decay period after each pulse. These emissions decay at a rate which depends on two relaxation time constants, T2 and T2.In conventional NQR testing, either a substantial part of the free induction decay is measured after each pulse or the responses are measured as echoes in relatively short sampling periods between or following a relatively rapid succession of 

 - 1 - pulses. Usually the results from a number of test pulses or test sequences are integrated to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Various schemes of pulse sequences have been used.In a scientific paper by Grechiskin et _ (Adv. N.Q.R., 1983, 5, 1) it has been predicted theoretically that conditions might arise which could give rise to the formation of a single echo as well as a free induction decay from nuclei of unity spin quantum number when excited by two excitation pulses at a single radiofrequency. No details are given as to how, or even whether, this can be achieved experimentally.In a paper by Bloom
