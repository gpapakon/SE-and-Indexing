<ABSTRACT>
A signalling light for a motor vehicle comprises a plurality of individual light sources having a light-emitting diode (404), interacting with optical arrangements (502). According to the invention, the following are provided:   - a common inner plate (300) comprising a set of cavities (302) flaring outwards and having at their base an opening through which a respective light-emitting diode emits light, - a common outer plate (500) arranged substantially against an outer face of the said inner plate and comprising, in line with each cavity, an optical arrangement (502) for processing the light output by the corresponding light-emitting diode, and   - a closure glass (200) located outside the outer plate, characterised in that it furthermore comprises a plurality of printed circuits (402) of elongate shape, on which a plurality of light-emitting diodes (404) are respectively mounted, and in that the inner plate comprises means (308) for mounting of the said printed circuits parallel to one another. The invention also provides a block of signalling lights as defined hereinabove.
