<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a non-linear optically active polyurethane comprising a polymeric main chain and a donor-(pi)-acceptor sidegroup, with the sidegroup comprising a rigid donor group which is also part of the polymeric main chain. By incorporating rigid donor groups into the non-linear optically active polyurethane a high glass transition temperature (Tg above 170  C) is obtained, and hence increased thermal stability. The invention further relates to non-linear optically active polyurethanes having a Tg above 170  C, and to non-linear optically active waveguides comprising non-linear optically active polyurethanes according to the invention. Suitable rigid donor groups include nitrogen- or sulphur-containing alicyclic groups. In particular, dihydroxy pyrrolidine groups in which the nitrogen atom is directly coupled to the (pi)-acceptor group and dithiafulvene groups were found to be highly suitable for obtaining non-linear optically active polyurethanes of good thermal stability and polarizability.

<DESCRIPTION>
NON-LINEAR OPTICALLY ACTIVE POLYURETHANES HAVING HIGH GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURESThe invention relates to a non-linear optically active polyurethane comprising a polymeric main chain and a donor-rr-acceptor sidegroup. Such non-linear optically active polyurethanes are known from EP 0350 112, which discloses non-linear optically active polyurethanes comprising a donor-rr-acceptor group of which the donor group comprises an oxygen atom or nitrogen atom coupled directly to a benzene ring of the rr-acceptor system, with the rr-system being a stilbene group.When polymeric non-linear optically active material is poled, non¬ linear polarisation will be effected in it under the influence of an external field of force (such as an electric field of force). Non¬ linear electric polarisation may give rise to a number of optically non-linear phenomena, such as frequency doubling and Pockels effect. By utilising these phenomena it is possible to employ this material in optically active waveguiding structures such as optical switches, frequency doublers, etc. in the form of a poled film.While the stability of poled films made of the present non-linear optically active polymers is excellent at room temperature, it leaves something to be desired at elevated temperature: relaxation results in lower values of the Pockels coefficients (>33 and ri3, in this description it is assumed that r33 = 3 x r- ) . The Pockels coefficient (1*33) is indicative of the non-linear optical behaviour of the film. The poor thermal stability of poled films of known non-linear optically active polymers gives rise to problems especially when the polymer is briefly heated to 200°-300°C during soldering. Neither are the present non-linear optically active polymers suitable for constant use at elevated operating temperatures in the range of 60° to 120°C. To enhance thermal stability efforts have been made, int. al., to 

render non-linear optically active polyacrylates less flexible by omitting the conventional spacers between the main chain and the donor-rr-acceptor sidegroup. However, it was found that such polyacrylates could not be poled.The present invention has for its object to obviate these drawbacks and provide a non-linear optically active polymer of which the poled film is thermally stable without the polability being negated. To this end the invention consists in that the sidegroup of the non-linear optically active polyurethane comprises a rigid donor group which is also part of the polymeric main chain.Polyurethanes do not require
