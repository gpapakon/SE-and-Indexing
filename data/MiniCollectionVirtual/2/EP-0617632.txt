<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a surgical instrument and specifically is a device for delivering embolic coils (102) to a selected site within the vasculature of a human body via use of a catheter. The invention further includes the coils (102). In particular, the device uses embolic coils having interlocking ends, e.g., clasps (114) or hooks (318), on the ends of the coils. The coils may further be secured to each other by a control wire within the catheter. Retraction of the optional control wire (106) into the catheter body uncouples the distal coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a surgical instrument and
specifically is a device for delivering embolic coils to a
selected site within the vasculature or other lumen of a
human body via use of a catheter. The invention further
includes the coils. In particular, the device (typically
a "pusher assembly" in conjunction with a catheter) uses
embolic coils having interlocking ends, e.g., clasps or
hooks, on at least one end of the coils. The coils may
further be secured to each other by a control wire within
the catheter. The coils are pushed out the end of the
catheter for placement and retraction of the optional
control wire into the catheter body uncouples the distal
coil. If no control wire is used, the coil is self-disengaging.The endovascular treatment of a variety of
vascular maladies throughout the body is an increasingly 
more important form of therapy. Catheters have been used
to place various treatment materials, devices, and drugs
within arteries and veins in the human body. Examples of
these devices and their use in such treatments are shown in
US-A-5,234,437 ("Detachable
Pusher-Vasoocclusive Coil Assembly with Threaded Coupling")
and US-A-5,261,916
published after the filing date of the present application
("Detachable Pusher-Vasoocclusive Coil
Assembly with Interlocking Ball and Keyway Coupling").
These show methods and devices for delivery of coils or
wires within the human body to sites such as aneurysms, to
occlude those sites. Coils such as are discussed in
US-A-4,994,069, may be of a regular or helical
configuration or assume a random convoluted configuration
at the selected site. The coils normally are made of a
radiopaque, biocompatible metal such as platinum, gold,
tungsten, or alloys of these and other metals.In treating aneurysms it is common to place a
number of coils within the aneurysm. The coils occlude the
site by posing a physical barrier to blood flow and by
promoting thrombus formation at the site.Coils have typically been placed at the desired
site within the vasculature using a catheter and a pusher.
The site is first accessed by the distal end of a catheter.
In treating peripheral or neural conditions requiring
occlusion, the sites are accessed with flexible, small
diameter catheters such as those shown in
US-A-4,739,768 and US-A-4,813,934. The catheter may be guided to the
site through the use of guidewires (see US-A-4,884,579)
or by flow-directed means such as balloons
placed at the distal end of the catheter. Use of
guidewires involves the placement of relatively long,
torqueable

<CLAIMS>
A detachable coil assembly for use in occluding
a selected vascular site, comprising a coil (300,316) with

a coil axis, a distal end, a proximal end (308) and a cap
on at least one of said proximal and distal ends,

characterised in that the cap has an open receiving slot
(310) generally perpendicular to the coil axis, where the

open receiving slot (310) is suitable for accepting a hook
(214,222,223, 318,322) adapted to enter the open receiving

slot and adapted also to exit the open receiving slot.
The assembly of claim 1, where the distal coil
end comprises a closed hook (318) adapted to enter a

receiving slot (310) in another detachable coil assembly.
The assembly of claim 1, where the distal coil
end comprises a bent ribbon having a lip adapted to enter a

receiving slot (310) in another detachable coil assembly.
The assembly of any one of claims 1 to 3,
additionally comprising an axial passageway extending from

the distal to the proximal end.
A combination pusher assembly-coil assembly for
use in occluding a selected vascular site, comprising:


(a) a coil assembly comprising a coil (243,300,316)
with an axis, a distal end, and a proximal end and having,

on at least its proximal end, an open receiving slot
(248,310) generally perpendicular to the coil axis, where

the open receiving slot (248,310) is suitable for accepting
a closed hook (214,222,223,244) adapted to enter the 

receiving slot and adapted also to exit the open receiving
slot; and
(b) a pusher assembly (200) comprising a core wire
(202) having proximal and distal ends and adapted to fit
