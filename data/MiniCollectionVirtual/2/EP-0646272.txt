<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a detection and amplification circuit 
capable of simultaneously receiving both a magneto-optic (MO) 
signal and a read-only (ROM) signal reflected from an optical 
disk and simultaneously amplifying both signals. Optical disk devices are used for the storage of 
computer-prepared data and have recognized value in their 
ability to store large quantities of data. The media for use in 
such devices is reactive to bursts of light, such as may be 
produced by the rapid switching of a semi-conductor laser. In 
order to write data on optical media, the laser power must be 
controlled at a fairly high power level, in order that the media 
can be altered in accordance with digits of data. In reading 
the data back, the laser power level is controlled to a lower 
level so that the media is not altered by the laser beam but the 
reflected light indicates the presence or absence of media 
alterations, that is, digits of data. Optical media is of two general types, media which can be 
written only once and media which can be written, erased, and 
written again. Write-once media (WORM) is permanently altered 
when write power levels are produced by the laser beam. 
Erasable media, such as magneto-optic (MO) media, is not 
permanently altered when data is written. In the MO media, the 
magnetic orientation of the reactive material is altered in the 
writing process, and in the erasing process, the magnetic 
orientation is reordered. When reading MO data from an optical disk, the remanent 
magnetization of one or the other polarity rotates the linear 
polarization of a reflected light beam creating P and S 
polarization components. By detecting these components of the 
light beam, an MO data signal is generated.  
 To readback data contained on write-once media, the reflected 
light beam is intensity modulated by the permanent condition of 
the disk. By detecting the intensity of the reflected light 
beam, a ROM signal is generated in accordance with the WORM 
data. In operating an optical disk system, it is necessary to identify 
the particular sector and track upon which the laser beam is 
directed. That identification information is included in a 
sector header stamped onto the disk itself. The user area, that 
is the data area, may be either write-once or erasable, but the 
sector header will always be permanent. Thus, even when writing 
or reading MO media, it is necessary to generate non-MO signals, 
ROM signals, from a sector header area. In the writable region used for MO customer
