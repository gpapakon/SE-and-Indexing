<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of organic
chemistry. More particularly, this invention relates to
2-acetylglutarate esters of polyols as polymer crosslinkers
for use in thermosetting coating compositions,
as well as methods of preparation of these materials.Crosslinkers are multi-functional molecules capable
of reacting with pendant functional groups on polymers.
The use of crosslinkers enables one to increase the
molecular weight of the resin or polymer and thus
improve the properties of the resulting polymer or
polymeric film. Most crosslinking reactions are
initiated by heating a mixture of the polymer and the
crosslinker either neat or in a solvent. Such systems
are often referred to as "thermosetting" systems.Crosslinkers are particularly useful in coating
applications due to the fact that the crosslinker
enables the use of relatively low molecular weight
polymers and resins which are easily handled and applied
in solvents. The formulation can subsequently be
applied to the substrate and heated, or cured, to give
the finished (thermoset) coating. This feature makes it
possible to take advantage of the ease of handling and
solubility characteristics of the lower molecular weight
resins used in the formulation and subsequently develop
the hardness, chemical and solvent resistance, as well
as strength properties desired in the ultimate coating
by the reaction of the crosslinker with the resin during
the curing process.Crosslinkers are becoming increasingly important
due to the emphasis on more environmentally acceptable
coatings. One major environmental concern in the 
coatings industry is the amount of organic solvent
released during the curing process. This solvent level
or Volatile Organic Content (VOC) is of concern due to
the role of organic solvents in the development of
photochemical smog. For these reasons various governments,
including the U.S., are regulating the VOC levels
of coating formulations. One way to reduce the amount
of solvent necessary in a coating formulation is to
reduce the molecular weight of the resin backbone used
in the formulation. When this approach is used,
however, crosslinking becomes even more critical to the
development of the ultimate properties in the cured
film.A number of properties are desired in a coating in
order to impart the desired protection of the object
from corrosion and other environmental factors. Some of
the protective characteristics that are ultimately
desired include the resistance of the coating to various
chemicals and solvents, the impact
