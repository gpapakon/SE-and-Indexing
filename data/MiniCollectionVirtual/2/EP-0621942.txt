<ABSTRACT>
The system at issue applies to the field of topographical, cadastral and any other kind of ground survey, including the measurement and mapping of interiors. Such system allows the measurement both of distances between points and of their heights, even when the points to be surveyed are not visible from the survey stations. It employs at least two portable stationary rods (9) and one portable mobile rod (1), each made of a tube (12) of watertight and insulating material provided with both a lower pointed end (13) and an upper spheric level (2). Inside each rod are housed an accumulator (6), a transceiver (4), an aerial (15), a barometric sensor (3) and the electronic components (5) or (10). The electronic components are structured differently according to the portable rod they are in. Each portable mobile rod (1) also includes a portable control keyboard.

<DESCRIPTION>
The system at issue has been studied to be of great 
use in the field of topographical, cadastral and any 
other kind of ground surveys, including the 
measurement and the mapping of interiors. By means of electromagnetic waves and barometric 
sensors, the above-mentioned system allows the 
measurement both of distances between points and of 
their heights, even when the points to be surveyed 
are not visible from the survey stations. Most of the systems employed in this field use high 
precision optical and mechanical-optical instruments. 
The application of electronics in this field is 
relatively recent and it integrates traditional 
optical devices such as tacheometers, theodolites 
etc. This is due both to the increased potentiality 
of the instruments and to the reduction of the risk 
of errors. Electronic devices allow more accurate 
measurements, they save time in the processing of the 
data, while their accessories are lighter, less bulky 
and easy to carry. All these advantages obviously 
influence the price, which is sensibly higher than 
that of the traditional instruments. Data registers that, once connected to an electronic  
 
unit, can automatically record all the surveyed 
data, descriptions of the targets surveyed and 
additional notes of various kind, have been recently 
put on the market. When connected to a computer, 
such registers transfer the surveyed data to it, 
producing tabulations and/or graphics with no need 
of the operator's presence. This completely 
prevents any possibility of mistake both in the 
transcriptions and in the conversion computation of 
the surveyed data. Since all the instruments currently employed, both traditional and electronic, are basically optical, 
they all need the points to survey to be visible to 
the operator working on the instrumental unit. The 
European Patent EP-A-0 051 913 filed on August 14th 
1981 must be mentioned in connection with this. 
This Patent describes a method and an apparatus for 
remote control surveying of distances, the method 
comprises the steps of positioning electronic 
distance measuring and rotating reflector units in 
spaced relation, of energizing the reflector unit 
from adjacent the measuring device in order to 
create a sight line between the devices, and of 
measuring the distance between the devices with the 
electronic distance measuring device.  
 The surveying apparatus comprises a reflector unit, 
a motor for rotating said unit, a radio receiver 
energizing said motor and a portable radio 
transmitter
