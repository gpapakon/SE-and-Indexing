A method for regulating the refrigerant flow to an 
evaporator of a cooling plant or heat pump, in which 

the refrigerant circuit runs from the pressure side 
of a compressor (1) via a condensor (2), at or 

downstream whose outlet a collector (7) can be 
arranged, via an expansion valve (8) which is 

controllable with respect to its degree of opening, 
and via an evaporator (3) until the suction side of 

the compressor (1), and whose expansion valve (8) 
can be regulated in dependence on reference values 

by means a positioning motor (4) controlled by a 
computer (10) as a function of the signals (T
E
, T
A
) 
from temperature responsive sensors (5, 6) arranged 

at the inlet and the outlet side of the evaporator 
(3), in which 


if the inlet temperature (T
E
) of the evaporator 
(3) is below a threshold value (T
max
), the 
expansion valve (8) is actuated in the sense of an 

increasing opening, when the difference (T
D
) 
between the inlet and outlet temperatures (T
E
, T
A
) 
of the evaporator (3) exceeds a reference value 

(T
Dref
), or in the sense of an increasing closing, 
when the said difference (T
D
) is lower than the 
reference value, and 
if the inlet temperature (T
E
) of the evaporator 
(3) is above the threshold value (T
max
), the 
expansion valve (8) is displaced in the closing 

direction, 

  
 

characterized in that
 
if the inlet temperature (T
E
) of the evaporator (3) 
is in the vicinity of the threshold value (T
max
) or 
between this threshold value and a neighboring 

threshold value (T'
max)
, the expansion valve (8) is 
controlled exclusively as a function of the inlet 

temperature (T
E
), and indeed in such a manner that 
the inlet temperature (T
E
) remains nearly constant, 
or decreases only by a small amount, the outlet 

temperature (T
A
) of the evaporator (3) coming closer 
to the inlet temperature (T
E
). 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the expansion valve is controlled exclusively as a 

function of the inlet temperature (T
E
) until the 
outlet temperature of the evaporator (T
A
) has 
reached a value slightly lower (e.g. 2°K) than the 

inlet temperature of the evaporator (T
E
) and/or the 
inlet temperature of the evaporator (T
E
) has 
decreased to a second threshold value (T'
max
) which 
is slightly below (e.g. 2°K) the first threshold 

value. 
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the expansion valve (8) is 

firstly completely closed if the inlet temperature 
(T
E
) of the evaporator (3) is above the threshold 
value (T
max
), and then controllably opened, in 
particular opened for a short period or a plurality 

of short periods, if the inlet temperature (T
E
) 
decreases more slowly than expected although the 

compressor is in operation, or if the threshold 
value (T
max
) of the inlet temperature is not reached 
after a predetermined time period.  

 
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the expansion valve (8) is opened in a pulsed manner 

and controlled by modulation of the pulse width. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the expansion valve (8) is 

fully closed when the compressor (1) is not 
operating.
