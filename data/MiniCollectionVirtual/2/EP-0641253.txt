<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a process for the regeneration of a catalyst system component comprising certain transition aluminas promoted with a Lewis acid (preferably BF3) which have been used in the alkylation of isoparaffin with olefins. The process involves the calcination of the catalyst system component to volatilize and to oxidize the reaction product residue adhering to the solid catalyst. The process may include recovery and recycle of the involved Lewis acid.

 A METHOD FOR REGENERATINGLEWIS ACID-PROMOTED TRANSITION ALUMINA CATALYSTSUSED FOR ISOPARAFFIN ALKYLATIONBY CALCINATIONRELATED APPLICATIONS This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Nos. 07/588,448 to Cooper â‰¤ Sl. entitled "ISOPARAFFIN ALKYLATION USING A LEWIS ACIDPROMOTED TRANSITION ALUMINA CATALYST (PA-0017)" filed September 26, 1990; 07/697,318 to Cooper s - entitled "ISOPARAFFIN ALKYLATION USING A LEWIS ACID PROMOTED TRANSITION ALUMINA CATALYST (PA-0060)" filed May 7, 1991; and 07/697,320 to Cooper jLaL entitled "LEWIS ACID PROMOTED TRANSITION ALUMINA CATALYSTS SUITABLE FOR ISOPARAFFIN ALKYLATION (PA-0051)" filed May 7, 1991; the entirety of which are incorporated by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is a process for the regeneration of a catalyst system component comprising certain transition aluminas promoted with a Lewis acid (preferably BF3) which have been used in the alkylation of isoparaffin with olefins. The process involves the calcination of the catalyst system component to volatilize and to oxidize the reaction product residue adhering to the solid catalyst. The process may include recovery and recycle of the involved Lewis acid.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The preparation of high octane blending components for motor fuels using strong acid alkylation processes (notably where the acid is hydrofluoric acid or sulfuric acid) is well-known. Alkylation is the reaction in which an alkyl group is added to an organic molecule (typically an aromatic or olefin). For production of gasoline blending stocks, the reaction is between an isoparaffin and an olefin. Alkylation processes have been in wide use since World War II when high octane 

 gasolines were needed to satisfy demands from high compression ratio or supercharged aircraft engines. The early alkylation units were built in conjunction with fluid catalytic cracking units to take advantage of the light end by-products of the cracking units: isoparaffins and olefins. Fluidized catalytic cracking units still constitute the major source of feedstocks for gasoline alkylation units. In sp'rte of the mature state of strong acid alkylation technology, existing problems with the hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid technologies continue to be severe: disposal of the used acid, unintentional emission of the acids during use or storage, substantial corrosivity of the acid catalyst systems, and other environmental concerns. Although a practical alkylation process using solid acid catalysts having little or no corrosive components

WE CLAIM AS OUR INVENTION:
1. A method for regenerating an alkylation catalyst component which component comprises a major amount of a transition alumina which has been contacted under substantially anhydrous conditions with a strong Lewis acid to produce an alkylation catalyst component containing between 0.5% and 30% by weight of Lewis acid and has been partially deactivated by use in an alkylation reaction medium, comprising the steps of: a. separating the alkylation catalyst from any alkylation reaction medium, b. contacting the alkylation catalyst with an oxygen- containing gas and maintaining a gas outlet temperature between 350' and 800'C.
2. The process of claim 1 where the transition alumina is selected from gamma-alumina, eta-alumina, theta-alumina, chi-alumina, rho- alumina, and mixtures.
3. The process of claim 2 where the transition alumina is selected from gamma-alumina, eta-alumina, and mixtures.
