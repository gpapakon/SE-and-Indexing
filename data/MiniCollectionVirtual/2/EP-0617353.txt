<ABSTRACT>
A neural network layer (1) is made up of nodes or neurons 
which each comprise a pair of physically separate and 

optically coupled sub-units (X
i
, Y
i
). One sub-unit 
broadcasts excitatory and receives inhibitory signals, 

whereas the other sub-unit broadcasts inhibitory and 
receives the excitatory signals. An electrical feedback 

connection (2) is provided between corresponding sub-units 
for determination of net node activation. Optical 

coupling is by means of diffractive (2) or holographic 
optical elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a lateral neural network
structure comprising a layer having a plurality of neurons
comprising means for optical lateral interconnection.Neural networks are generally classified in one of three
classes, feedforward, recurrent and lateral. In the
feedforward type, neuron connections are only in the
forward direction, whereas in the recurrent type, they are
both forward and backward. In the lateral type, there are
lateral connections between neurons of at least one layer.
These connections may be inhibitory (negative) and/or
excitatory (positive). The invention relations to neural
networks of this type.Use of lateral neural networks is important for some
processing applications. One such application is retinal
processing. Features of retinal processing are contrast
enhancement and local intensity independence. For example
in U.S. Patent Specification No. 5,033,103 (U.S.A.) a
system is disclosed which enhances edges, eliminates
brightness variations and suppresses noise.Lateral neural networks are also important in achieving
unsupervised and self-organising sub-systems. Large scale
lateral inhibition can give rise to competitive or
"winner-take-all" behaviour within an area defined by the
range of the inhibition. When excitatory connections are
used also, topographic or computational mapping can be
established. This is because if a particular node
responds to a given input, nearby nodes may also partly
respond. There is extensive evidence from neuroscience as
to the importance of topographic mappings and indeed it is 
regarded as being a building block in the infrastructure
of information processing in the nervous system.At present, most electronic and opto-electronic neural
networks have inhibitory connections only. Optics have
major advantages for the implementation of such dense,
recurrent type interconnections. An example of such a
network is disclosed in the paper "Lateral inhibitory
action in an optical neural network using an internal-light-coupled
optical device array" by Wataru Kawakami,
Ken-ichi Kitayama, Yoshinori Nakano and Masahiro Ikeda in
Optics Letters Vol 16, No. 13 July 1, 1991. In this
paper, a structure is disclosed whereby each neuron
comprises a light-emitting section surrounded by a
detecting section for inhibitory interconnections. In the
neuron, an array plane and a reflector have holes which
must be aligned so that almost all the external light
input through the hole which corresponds to an excitatory
signal illuminates the light emitting section of the
