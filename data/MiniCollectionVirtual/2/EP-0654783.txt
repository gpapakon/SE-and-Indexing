<ABSTRACT>
A multilayered thin film longitudinal recording medium is produced 
by applying two or more magnetic layers (12, 13) to a supporting substrate 

(10), the magnetic properties of the individual magnetic layers (12, 13) being 
independently controlled to impart improved overwrite properties to the medium. 

The resulting medium might include magnetic layers which have different 
thicknesses, or are produced from different alloy compositions, or are the 

products of different process parameters. Boundary separation layers (15) 
might or might not be included between adjacent magnetic layers (12, 13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a multilayered thin film 
longitudinal recording medium. It pertains more particularly to a multilayered 
medium which exhibits improved overwrite properties, in comparison to the 
overwrite properties of a similar medium having only one magnetic layer, when 
used with a selected recording head. Digital information is recorded in magnetic recording disks along 
circular strips or tracks along which the magnetization vector of the magnetic 
layer of the disk alternates between clockwise and counterclockwise in a 
pattern which encodes the data. One of the problems in magnetic recording is 
to fabricate media having adequate overwrite properties. The term "overwrite" 
refers to the capacity of the media to have substantially all vestiges of old data 
erased when new data is recorded on top of the old data. A recognized overwrite phenomenon occurs in which the pattern 
of old data affects the final recorded pattern of new data and leads to an 
interference signal in the new data. It has now been fairly well established that 
in the case of thin film media this interference signal is not caused by 
incomplete erasure of old lower frequency data recorded in the deep layers of 
the medium when overwritten by higher frequency data even though the higher 
frequency head fields do not penetrate as deeply into a thick recording medium 
as do the lower frequency head fields. Rather, the modulation of new data by 
pre-existing data is caused by the demagnetizing field of a transient transition at 
the leading edge of the gap or "write bubble". This transient transition is present or not depending on the relative 
directions of the head field and the medium magnetization under the gap. It 
results in what are called "hard" and "easy" transitions being written at the 
trailing part of the gap. It is worse when the demagnetizing fields in the  
 
medium are greater or when the recording bubble is smaller. Pre-existing data will determine the frequency and pattern of hard 
and easy transitions. Hard transitions are shifted in position from their intended 
positions, and may also be wider than easy transitions. They therefore reduce 
the error margin in a disk drive product. In the search for ways to reduce medium noise it was previously 
discovered that fabrication of media in the form of multiple magnetic layers of 
magnetic material separated by thin non-magnetic layers dramatically reduced 
the medium noise. However, this structure also resulted in worse overwrite.

   a substrate (10); and 
   a plurality of magnetic layers (12,13) disposed on the substrate; 

   the medium being characterized by: 
   each magnetic layer (12, 13) having different magnetic properties 

selected to impart improved overwrite characteristics to the medium, in 
comparison to the overwrite characteristics of a similar single layer medium, 

when the medium is used with a selected type of recording head. 
The medium of claim 1 further characterized by the 
thicknesses of the magnetic layers being varied. 
The medium of claim 1 further characterized by the alloy 
compositions of the magnetic layers (12, 13) being varied. 
The medium of claim 1 further characterized by the 
magnetic layers (12, 13) being formed by use of differing process parameters. 
The medium of claim 1, further characterized by adjacent 
magnetic layers (12, 13) being arranged directly on one another and with no 

boundary separation layer between them. 
The medium of claim 1, further characterized by adjacent 
magnetic layers (12, 13) being separated by a thin non-magnetic boundary 

separation layer (15). 
The medium of claim 1, further characterized by adjacent 
magnetic layers (12, 13) being separated by a continuous thin non-magnetic 

boundary separation layer (15) having a thickness of less than 100 Angstroms, 
 

the thickness of the boundary separation layer (15) being sufficient to 
substantially eliminate exchange coupling between the adjacent magnetic layers 

(12, 13). 
The medium of claim 1, further characterized by the 
magnetic layers (12, 13) creating gradients of coercivity and magnetization-thickness 

product through the thickness of the medium. 
A method for producing thin film longitudinal magnetic 
recording medium having improved overwrite, comprising the following steps: 

   forming a substrate (10); and 
   depositing a plurality of magnetic layers (12, 13) on the substrate 

(10); 
   the method being characterized by the following substep: 

   independently controlling the magnetic properties of the resulting 
individual magnetic layers (12, 13) to impart improved overwrite characteristics 

to the medium, in comparison to the overwrite characteristics of a similar single 
layer medium, when the medium is used with a selected type of recording head. 
The method of claim 9, further characterized by the substep 
of interposing a thin non-magnetic boundary separation layer (15) between 

adjacent deposited magnetic layers (12, 13).
