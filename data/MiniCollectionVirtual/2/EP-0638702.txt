<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a window sash, in particular for windows which can pivot or those which can pivot or tilt, having a sash frame (10) and a glass pane (24) inserted into the sash frame (10). The sash frame is made up of four frame members (28 to 34) which are connected to one another in pairs at the frame corners (26) and preferably comprise hollow-chamber profile rails, while the glass pane (24) is supported, with its edges (68), on the frame members (28 to 34) via spacing wedge elements (12 to 18). In order to permit subsequent fine adjustment of the wedge elements on the assembled window sash, the invention proposes that at least one of the wedge elements (12, 14) be arranged on the relevant frame member (32, 30) such that it can be adjusted from the outside, parallel to the plane of the frame, with respect to the adjacent glass-pane edge.

A window wing, in particular for pivoting windows
or pivot-hung windows, comprising a wing

frame (10) composed of four frame spars which
preferably consist of hollow chamber profile

rails which are joined to each other in pairs at
frame corners, and comprising a glass pane which

is mounted in the wing frame (10) and which is
supported on the frame spars (28, 30, 32, 34)

with its edges by means of spacing wedge elements
(12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22), wherein at least

one of the wedge elements (12, 14) is arranged
on the corresponding frame spar (32, 30) parallel

to the plane of the frame such that it is
externally adjustable with respect to the adjacent

glass pane edge (68), wherein the adjustable
wedge element comprises a threaded bolt

(64) which is guided in a threaded socket (62)
of the frame spar (30) and which is adapted to

be externally rotated by means of a tool, and a
thrust part (70) which lies against the glass

pane edge (68) and which is connected to the
threaded bolt (64) in a rotatable and non-displaceable

manner, and wherein the threaded
bolt (64) has a radially protruding head part

(66) at its end at the glass pane side to which
the thrust part (70) is connected, 
characterized
in that
 the thrust part (70) is provided with an
undercut groove, into which the plate-shaped

head part (66) can be inserted, that the length
of the thrust part corresponds to the thickness

of the glass pane (24), and that the thrust 
part, in its mounted state, is aligned with its

undercut groove perpendicular with respect to
the plane of the glass pane.
The window wing of claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the threaded socket (62) is designed to be
a moulding preferably made of plastic, is inserted

into a bore (71) of the frame spar from
the casing side and is supported thereon by

means of a stop (66).
The window wing of claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the threaded bolt (64) is adapted to be externally
actuated by way of a cross bore (72) of

the frame spar (30) which is oriented toward the
open face side (74) of the threaded socket (62).
The window wing of one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
in that
 the frame spars (30) are composed
of a metal inner shell (42) and a metal

outer shell which is connected to the inner
shell by means of insulating ribs (46, 48) preferably

made of plastic, and that the threaded
socket (62) is inserted into a cross bore (71)of

one of the insulating ribs (46).
The window wing of claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the threaded bolt (64) is adapted to be externally
actuated through a cross bore (72) in

one of the insulating ribs (48). 
The window wing of one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
in that
 the threaded socket (62) is secured
against rotation with respect to the corresponding

frame spar (30) in a form and/or
friction fitting manner.
The window wing of one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
in that
 the thrust part (70) is secured
against rotation with respect to the glas pane

edge in a form and/or friction fitting manner.
The window wing of one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized
in that
 at least two wedge elements (12,
14) are provided on the wing frame (10) which

are adjustable in pairs in perpendicular directions
(36) with respect to each other.
The window wing of claim 8, 
characterized in
that
 the two wedge elements (12, 14) wich are
adjustable in pairs are disposed in the vicinity

of a frame corner on the corresponding vertical
and horizontal frame spars (30, 32).
The window wing of claim 9, 
characterized in
that
 in the case of a pivot wing or pivot-hung
wing the two wedge elements (12, 14) which are

adjustable in pairs are disposed close to the
upper frame corner at the handle side.
