<ABSTRACT>
Improved skate including a shoe (2) composed of a shell 
(3) with which a frame (4) for two or more mutually parallel 

or aligned wheels (5) is associated. In this skate, a first 
half-quarter (6) is articulated to the shell and is in turn 

connected to a braking element (8). A second half-quarter 
(16) is furthermore associated with the first half-quarter, 

and its position with respect to the first half-quarter is 
adjustable. The skate thus allows both optimum activation of 

the braking element and quick and easy variation of the 
support of the leg, for example according to the sport 

practiced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved skate. Conventional skates with aligned wheels are currently 
constituted by a shell associated with a frame having two or 
more wheels. Among the drawbacks observed in these conventional 
skates, the fact is stressed that they do not support the 
user's leg in an optimum manner according to the different 
needs required by the various sports specialties, such as 
speed skating or slalom. The use of levers in fact merely allows to secure the 
flaps of the shell more or less tightly without allowing any 
adjustment in the fitting of the shell on the foot. Technical problems arise in the attempt to apply to the 
skates the same production method of other fields, such as 
the field of ski boots, for example, in which a quarter is 
used in addition to the shell. French patent application no. 
7623112, filed on 23 July 1976 and published as FR-A-2 358 848, 
discloses a ski boot 
comprising a supporting element interposed between two flaps 
obtained at a recess formed on the rear-upper part of the 
shoe and allowing backward inclination of the skier's leg. This solution cannot be applied to a skate with aligned 
wheels, as it is necessary to achieve at all times optimum 
securing and support of the leg. Swiss patent application no. CH 668 682 A5, filed on 6 
June 1986, discloses a ski boot comprising a quarter 
articulated to a shell and having securing means 
interacting, at one end, with said quarter by virtue of 
fixing means which can be adjusted vertically. For this 
solution, too, it is possible to improve the securing action  
 
according to the inclination of the quarter. This known solution, too, like the preceding one, 
cannot be used for a skate with aligned wheels, also due to 
a further problem, namely the presence of a device which 
allows braking. Indeed, in this respect, in conventional roller skates, 
whether constituted by a shoe associated with a support for 
two pairs of mutually parallel wheels or by a shoe 
associated with a supporting frame for two or more aligned 
wheels, there is the problem of braking the wheels to 
adjust the speed of the skate. It is known to use adapted blocks or pads, usually made 
of rubber, arranged at the toe or heel region of the shoe. 
When the user tilts the shoe forwards or backwards, the free 
end of the blocks or pads interacts with the ground, and 
braking is thus achieved. However, these solutions are not optimum, as they 
require the user to rotate the shoe, and thus the frame 
associated therewith, at the

Skate, comprising a shoe (2) composed of a 
shell (3) with which a frame (4) for a plurality of wheels 

(5) is associated, a first articulated half-quarter (6) connected to a 
braking element (8), 


characterized in that
 said first half quarter is articulated 
to said shell (3), and in that it comprises a second half-quarter 

(16) associated with said first half-quarter and 
adjustable in its vertical position with respect to said 

first half-quarter, such that the braking action can be 
activated independently of the presetting of the position of 

the second half-quarter with respect to the first half-quarter. 
Skate according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said first half-quarter is articulated to said shell by 

means of a first pair of studs (7) and at least partially 
surrounds the user's leg, an end of a rod member (9) being 

transversely and rotatably associated, by means of a first 
pivot (10), to the rear of said first half-quarter; said rod 

member being rotatably associated, at its other end, by 
means of a second pivot (12), with a support (13) which is 

in turn rotatably associated with said frame and has a pad 
(15) directed toward the ground. 
Skate according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said second half-quarter is associated with said first half-quarter 

by virtue of means that allow to adjust their mutual 
arrangement, said means being constituted by a second pair 

of studs (17) which are laterally associated with said 
second half-quarter, the stems of said studs sliding at an 

adapted pair of guides (18) formed laterally with respect to  
 

said first half-quarter. 
Skate according to claim 3, characterized in that 
said second half-quarter surrounds at least partially the 

skater's leg and is arranged outside said first half-quarter. 
Skate according to claim 3, characterized in that 
said pair of guides (18) is C-shaped, with its wings 

directed toward the toe of said shell. 
Skate according to claim 5, characterized in that a 
lug (20) protrudes to the rear of said first half-quarter 

and can be arranged at a slot formed on said second half-quarter. 
Skate according to one or more of claims 3-6, 
characterized in that said means for adjusting the mutual 

arrangement are constituted by a plurality of lugs (120) 

protruding to the rear of said first half-quarter and are 
arrangeable at a plurality of holes (121) on said second 

half-quarter (116).
