<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to the assay and purification of proteins, and particularly to the non-radioactive assay and purification of protein kinases, phosphatases and protease by incubating the enzyme with a substrate modified peptide to form a product modified peptide under conditions where the enzyme is active. The product modified peptide and substrate modified peptide are then separated, and the product modified peptide is measured. The present invention is also directed to kits and bioreagents for performing the assays.

<DESCRIPTION>
 KON-RADIOACTIVE ENZYME ASSAYFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to protein assays. More specifically, the invention relates 5 to assays of enzymes. The present invention relates particularly to a non-radioactive method of assaying theJ <i activity of protein kinases, phosphatases and proteases.REFERENCE TO CITED ART Reference is made to the section preceding the 10 CLAIMS for a full bibliography citation of the art cited herein.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Enzymes are large proteins that catalyze reactions in living cells. As used in this discussion, 15 the term "catalyze" refers to a substance that increases the velocity of a reaction over the velocity of an uncatalyzed reaction without itself undergoing a change. Enzymes are specific in their reactions. An individual enzyme may catalyze the reaction of one substrate or of a 20 group of related substrates.In healthy persons, most enzymes are found within cells. Some diseases, however, release enzymes from dying cells into the blood. The increased levels of enzymes can then be measured. An abnormal level of 25 enzymes in the blood characterizes certain medical conditions. For example, an enzyme assay for abnormal levels of creatine kinase in the blood is useful as a diagnostic of heart disease. When a heart attack occurs, cells are damaged and their enzymes leak into the 30 bloodstream. Enzyme levels increase markedly immediately following a heart attack. Therefore, a confirmation of a heart attack can be made by analyzing the enzyme levels in the blood. In like manner, bone or liver diseases can be diagnosed by increased levels of alkaline phosphatase 

 35 in the blood stream. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by increased levels of acid phosphatase. Reference is made to McMurrv (1989) for a general description of the medical uses of enzymes. 

 Enzymes are classified into groups according to the general kind of reaction they catalyze. For purposes of the present invention, reference is specifically made to two of the groups: (1) Transferases, which catalyze the transfer of a group from one substrate to another; and (2) Hydrolases, which catalyze the hydrolysis, i.e., the breakdown of proteins to amino acids, of substrates. The present invention is specifically directed to the transf rase subgroups kinases and phosphatases, and the hydrolase subgroup proteases. KinasesProtein kinases are enzymes which covalently modify proteins and peptides by the attachment of a phosphate group to one or more sites on the protein. Many of the
