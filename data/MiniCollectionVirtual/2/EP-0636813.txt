<ABSTRACT>
In the single- or multi-stage gear transmission with parallel shafts and load division, with an input gear (1), intermediate gears (2; 2') and an output gear (3), the input gear is guided in such a way between the intermediate gears (2), in guide bearings (4) for example, that, during operation, the input gear (1) is automatically displaced along a plane (E) parallel to the axis and sloping relative to the plane of the axes of the input and output gears by an angle ( alpha ) until the equilibrium of forces is established.

Parallel-shaft gear unit with load division, 
comprising a drive shaft whose driving gear (1) meshes 

with intermediate gears (2) of two intermediate shafts, 
the latter driving a driven shaft via gears directly or 

via other intermediate shafts, and the driving gear (1) 
being arranged and guided between the intermediate gears 

(2) such that the driving gear (1) together with its 
shaft can be moved automatically along an axially parallel 

plane (E), which is inclined at an angle α relative 
to the plane of the axes of the driving gear (1) and 

driven gear (3), so far that equilibrium of forces and 
thereby load balancing are achieved, characterized in 

that the guide bearings (4) of the driving gear (1) have 
greater bearing play (S
E
) in the direction of said 
inclined plane (E) than in the plane extending at right 

angles thereto. 
Gear unit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the driving gear (1) is arranged with its axis in 

the same plane as the axes of the intermediate gears (2). 
Gear unit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the driving gear (1), intermediate gears (2) and 

driven gear (3) form a closed gear train, the driving 
gear (1) being enclosed in the radial direction between 

the intermediate gears (2) and the driven gear (3). 
Gear unit according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the angle of inclination α of said 

plane (E) is equal to the tooth engagement angle. 
Gear unit according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that it is in the form of a two-stage or 

multistage gear unit.  
 
Use of the gear unit according to one of Claims 
1 to 5 as a reduction gear unit for a ship's drive.
