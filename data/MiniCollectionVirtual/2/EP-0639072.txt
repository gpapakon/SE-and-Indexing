<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition
for rectal administration
containing as
active ingredient a compound having selective agonist activity at 5HT1-like
receptors.5-HT1-like receptors are located, for example, in the dog saphenous vein and
the 5-HT1-like receptor agonists with which the present invention is concerned
contract the dog saphenous vein. Such compounds may therefore be identified
by their contractile effect on the dog isolated saphenous vein strip as described,
for example, by Apperley et al., Br. J. Pharmacol, 68, 215-224 (1980).
Compounds which are selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonists have also been
found to selectively constrict the carotid arterial bed of the anaesthetised dog.A variety of compounds which selectively constrict the dog isolated saphenous
vein strip and which constrict the carotid arterial bed of the anaesthetised dog
have been described in the art. These include indole derivatives such as those
disclosed interalia in published British Patent Specifications Nos. 2082175,
2081717, 2083463, 2124210, 2150932, 2162522, 2168347, 2168973, 2185020,

WO93/00094, WO91/18897 and WO93/00333. The compounds disclosed in
the specifications (hereinafter described as compounds A) are useful in the
treatment of migraine and cluster headache.Oral administration constitutes the generally preferred route for administration
of pharmaceuticals since this route is particularly convenient and acceptable to
patients. Unfortunately oral compositions may be associated with certain
disadvantages, particularly in the treatment of conditions such as migraine 
which may be accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting. Furthermore, migraine
is associated with delayed gastric emptying which may lead to both a delay and
an impairment of drug absorption following oral administration. It is highly
desirable, particularly in the treatment of acute conditions such as migraine, that
pharmaceutical compositions have a rapid and consistent onset of action
combined with sustained activity and good bioavailability. Rapid absorption can
be achieved by parenteral injection but this is unacceptable to some patients,
particularly if the drug is to be
