<ABSTRACT>
An active matrix display device comprises an array of 
display elements (12), e.g. liquid crystal display elements, 

connected between sets of row and column address conductors 
(22,24). A display element electrode (20) is connected to an 

associated address conductor (22) of one set via two, parallel, 
switch means each of which comprises at least two, two-terminal, 

bi-directional, non-linear devices (30), for example, MIM type 
thin film diode devices, connected in series. A bidirectional, 

non-linear device (e.g. 30b) of each switch means (e.g. 30a, 30b) 
is shared by, and comprises a part of, a switch means (e.g. 30b, 

30e) associated with a respective adjacent display element, there 
being in each switch means at least one non-linear device (e.g. 

30a) between the shared device (30b) and the display element 
electrode (20). In addition to providing fault tolerance in the 

event of a defective, open-circuit, device (30), the arrangement 
also allows any defective, short-circuit, device to be easily 

identified and removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an active matrix display device 
having a row and column array of display elements comprising 
spaced electrodes with electro-optical material therebetween and 
connected between sets of row and column address conductors, and 
in which the display elements of a row are each connected to a 
respective address conductor of one set via two parallel switch 
means which each comprise at least two, bidirectional, non-linear 
devices connected in series. A display device of the above kind may be used for 
datagraphic or video, e.g. T.V., display purposes. An active matrix liquid crystal display device in which each 
display element is connected in series with a switch means 
between row and column address conductors carried on opposed 
supporting plates and in which each switch means comprises two 
bidirectional thin film diodes (TFDs) is disclosed in the paper 
by Hirai et al entitled "Flicker-Free LCD with Bridge Structure 
SiNx TFD" in SID 90 Digest, pages 522 to 525. By using two TFDs 
the switch means is given a substantially symmetrical 
current/voltage characteristic when driven using voltages of one 
polarity and voltages of the opposite polarity. It is known also in active matrix display devices generally 
to connect a plurality of switch means in parallel between a 
display element electrode and an associated address conductor for 
redundancy purposes. An example of such a display device is 
described in EP-A-0460747. In this display device the display 
elements, comprising liquid crystal elements, are each defined by 
a pair of display element electrodes carried on respective glass 
supporting plates between which liquid crystal material is 
disposed. The plates carry respectively sets of row and column 
address conductors and individual display elements are provided 
at the region of the intersections of the crossing row and column 
address conductors. One display element electrode of each 
display element in a row is connected to a respective  
 
address conductor on the one plate via a switch means comprising 
two bidirectional thin film diodes (TFDs) in the form of MIM 
elements connected in series which are also carried on that 
plate. The two series connected MIM elements associated with a 
display element act as a switch means having a threshold 
characteristic which, in response to a predetermined voltage 
applied between the row and column address conductors associated 
with that display element, is turned on so as to transfer a 
charge to the display element
