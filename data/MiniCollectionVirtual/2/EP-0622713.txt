<ABSTRACT>
A digital communication network carries high and low priority data. 
The network stations that produce high priority data are assigned to a first 

group of stations and stations that produce low priority data are assigned to a 
second group with the two group not being mutually exclusive. Activity on 

the network is divided into periodic intervals of the same duration. Network 
control information, that defines how access to the medium, is determined 

is broadcast to all stations during a first segment of a periodic interval. The 
network control information defines the length of the periodic interval and 

of the periodic interval segments, and defines how many stations are in each 
group. Then during a second segment of the periodic interval, every station 

in the first group is afforded an opportunity, in a predefined order, to transmit 
high priority data over the medium. Stations in the second group are afforded 

an opportunity to transmit low priority data, when time remains after the first 
segment in a periodic interval before the network control information will be 

transmitted again. The specific station in the second group which is afforded 
an opportuinity to transmit first changes from periodic interval to periodic 

interval.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is digital communications networks, and more
particularly, to the protocol method used to communicate the digital data and the
apparatus which implement the protocol.Factories are automated by controllers that are programmed, or configured,
to operate specific machines or devices. Such controllers may be general purpose,
such as computers, numerical controls or programmable controllers; or they may
be special purpose controllers, such as robot controllers, weld controllers or motor
drives.Each controller connects to the various sensing devices and operating
devices on the machinery which it controls and it automates the operation of that
machinery by inputting data from the sensing devices and outputing the
appropriate data to the operating devices. This exchange of input and output
("I/O") data between the controller and the devices on the controlled machinery
is often accomplished by direct connections between ports on the controller and
each separate I/O device. However, when I/O devices are physically spread out
over a large area, the wiring costs associated with such separate connections can
become excessive.One way to reduce wiring in such applications is to multiplex I/O data
through a serial communications link. Such serial I/O links are commonly used
to connect the centrally located controller to separate remote racks, or chassis, that
are positioned adjacent to the I/O devices. Such "remote I/O systems" are
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,404,651; 4,413,319; 4,809,217 and
4,750,150, where the controller carries out a continuous high speed scan of the I/O
data associated with each remote rack and that data is conveyed through the serial
communications link. It can be appreciated that such serial I/O links must
promptly and reliably convey the I/O data, since that data is directly controlling
operating devices on a machine that is operating in real time.While a single controller may automate a machine, or a small group of
machines, such "islands of automation" must be connected together to truly 
automate an entire factory. These latter connections are provided by industrial
local area networks that enable each controller to send messages to other similar
controllers in the factory over serial data links. There are a large number of such
"peer-to-peer" communications networks known in the art, some of which are
developed by standards committees like IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.4, IEEE 802.5 and
MAP; and others are developed by manufacturers of the controller
