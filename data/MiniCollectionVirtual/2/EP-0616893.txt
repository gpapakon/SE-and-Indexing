<ABSTRACT>
A serial type ink jet printing apparatus for textile 
printing sets a print beginning position and a print 

ending position so that the space between the print 
beginning position and the print ending position is 

wider than the textile printing medium (236). When the 
printing operation is performed, a small amount of ink 

is discharged from an ink jet head (209) onto a textile 
support member (236) before the head (209) reaches the textile 

printing medium (236), by which ink with high viscosity can 
be exhausted in a continuous printing operation before 

printing on the textile. Therefore, the textile can be 
efficiently printed entirel
y from edge to edge with 
high quality, and a separate ink receiver for receiving 

the preliminarily discharged ink is rendered 
unnecessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and
method for ink jet printing, and, more particularly, to
an apparatus and method in which printing is performed
by ink discharged from a discharge port and attached
onto a printing medium such as a textile.An ink jet head applicable to an ink jet printing
apparatus generally has a discharge port for
discharging ink, a liquid channel for supplying ink to
the discharge port, an energy acting portion in the
liquid channel and energy generating means for
generating energy which acts on ink in the energy
acting portion to discharge ink from the discharge
port.Exemplary energy generating means are an
electromechanical converter such as a piezoelectric
element or the like, electromagnetic wave energy 
generating means for applying an electromagnetic wave
such as a laser or the like to the ink to form flying
liquid droplets, or an electrothermal converter, all
which have been well-known.An ink jet printing head provided with heat energy
generating means generally uses electrothermal
converters as the heat energy generating means, and has
electrodes, liquid passage walls and a top plate
provided on a substrate through processes like those
used for manufacturing semiconductors, which processes
incorporate various techniques including etching, vapor
deposition, sputtering or the like. Since the ink
discharge ports used for forming the flying liquid
droplets required for printing can be readily arranged
with high density, such an ink jet printing head has
the following advantages.
a) The ink jet printing head can be easily fabricated
and it can perform high resolution printing.b) A compact constitution of the ink jet printing
head can be provided.c) In the process of manufacturing the recording
head, the advantages of IC (integrated circuit)
technology or miniaturization technology, which have
been recently significantly improved from the viewpoint
of reliability and progress in the field of
semiconductor manufacturing, can be adopted as much as
possible. It is also possible to provide a recording
head with a two-dimensional array of discharge ports.With the above-described points considered, a multi-nozzle
recording head with high nozzle density can be 
attained without difficulty, and a large quantity of
recording heads can be manufactured with high
productivity and at low production cost.It is known to provide such a printing head, using an
electrothermal converter as the heat energy generating
means and manufactured through processes of
manufacturing
