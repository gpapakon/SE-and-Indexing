<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel IL-1α 
derivatives. Said IL-1α derivatives can be used for the 
preparation of a pharmaceutical composition, for example for 
the treatment of thrombocytopenia. The technology of cancer therapy has been 
advanced in recent years. Remarkable advances have been 
made not only in conventional surgical operations but also 
in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. However, 
the advantages of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 
particular are liable to be accompanied by severe side 
effects. The ideal chemotherapeutic agent is such that it 
displays a carcinostatic effect but little or no adverse 
affect on normal tissues. However, since conventional 
chemotherapeutic agents induce strong inhibition of the 
bone marrow accompanied by decreases in leukocytes and 
platelets, it is impossible to administer them 
consecutively over a long period, and the medication must 
be interrupted due to these side effects. The irradiation 
of X-ray or γ-ray for radiotherapy likewise causes adverse  
 
effects on hematogenic tissues such as the bone marrow. 
Particularly if leukocytes, platelets, etc. are markedly 
decreased, the irradiation should be discontinued. Transfusion is one of the conventional methods 
of inhibiting or ameliorating reductions in platelets, 
etc. which Serve as dose-limiting factors. However, since 
blood cells such as platelets and leucocytes have a short 
life, fresh blood cells should be frequently replenished 
with. When bone marrow disorder is severe, bone marrow 
transplantation should be performed. Such bone marrow 
transplantation is intended to transfer hematogenic stem 
cells of the bone marrow to the body and thus to produce 
platelets in the body. This method has afforded an 
epochal effect in therapy for certain types of tumors and 
thus established a fundamental therapy for malignant 
tumors. However, the above bone marrow transplantation 
has problems as follows:
 
It is very difficult to supply donors of bone marrow 
fitting to patients. Even if a donor is supplied, the 
transplantation operation is difficult and it generally 
takes several weeks for the bone marrow transplanted to 
take, commence hematogenesis and then produce leukocytes, 
platelets, etc. in peripheral blood. During this period, 
the patient therefore may hover between life and death. As described above, although transfusion and 
bone marrow transplantation are methods for ameliorating 
decreases in platelets and like side effects which occur 
in chemotherapy,
