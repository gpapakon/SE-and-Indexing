<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of determining the resistivity 
of a geological formation through which a metal-cased borehole passes, 

by means of at least three electrodes in contact with the casing and 
spaced apart in the longitudinal direction of the borehole. 
In order to eliminate the effect of any differences between the 
two sections of casing delimited by the electrodes, a circuit connected 

to the electrodes and forming a Wheatstone bridge is balanced, 
with said sections of casing constituting two of the resistances in 

said Wheatstone bridge circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to determining the resistivity of the
geological formations through which a metal-cased well passes.There is no longer any need to demonstrate the importance of
resistivity logs in oil prospecting. It is known that the resistivity
of a formation depends essentially on the fluid it contains: a
formation containing brine, i.e. a conductive liquid, has much lower
resistivity than a hydrocarbon-bearing formation, and consequently
resistivity measurements are unvaluable for locating hydrocarbon
deposits. Resistivity logs have been in widespread use for a long
time, and they have been made, in particular, by means of devices
having electrodes. However existing techniques are suitable for use
only in wells that are not cased ("open hole" wells in oil jargon).
The presence in a well of metal casing whose resistivity is tiny
compared with typical values for geological formations (about 2.10-7
ohm.m for steel casing as compared with 1 to 1,000 ohm.m for a
formation) constitutes a major impediment when it comes to applying
electrical currents to the formations surrounding the casing. One
particular result of this is that it is essential to perform
resistivity measurements before installing the casing. In particular,
it is not possible to obtain resistivity measurements for wells that
are in production, since such wells are cased.It would therefore be most advantageous to be able to measure the
resistivity of sections of cased wells. Such a measurement performed
at the level of the pay zone in a well would make it possible to
locate the interfaces between water and hydrocarbon, and therefore to
track changes over time in the positions of such interfaces, for the
purpose of monitoring the behavior of the hydrocarbon reservoir and
optimizing exploitation thereof. It would also be possible to obtain a
measure of the resistivity in a well (or a section of a well) in which
no measurement had been performed before the casing was installed, 
thereby making it possible to obtain further information about the
reservoir, and possibly to detect productive layers that were not
located initially.Proposals on this topic exist in the literature. As described in
US patent 2 459 196 (Stewart, assigned to Sun Oil Company), the basic
principle of the measurement consists in causing a current to flow
along the casing under conditions such that current leaks or is lost
to the formation. The amount of loss is a function of the resistivity
of the formation - the greater the conductivity of the formation the
greater

A method of determining the resistivity of a geological formation
having a metal-cased borehole passing therethrough by means of at

least three electrodes in contact with the casing and spaced apart in
the longitudinal direction of the borehole, comprising the steps of

providing a circuit forming a Wheatstone bridge and connected to said
three electrodes in such a manner that the two sections of casing

delimited by said electrodes constitute two of the resistances of the
bridge, and balancing said bridge circuit so as to eliminate the

effect of differences between said two sections of casing.
A method of determining the resistivity of a geological
formation through which a metal-cased borehole passes, in which at

least three electrodes spaced apart in the borehole direction are
placed in contact with the casing at the level of said formation,

comprising the steps of connecting said electrodes to a circuit
forming a Wheatstone bridge with the two sections of casing delimited

by the electrodes, applying a current in a first step in such a manner
as to flow substantially only through the casing and balancing the

bridge, applying a current in a second step in such a manner as to
enable current leakage to take place into the formation, and determining

the resistivity of the formation by using the bridge unbalance
due to the leakage current.

in said second step by applying an additional current to the casing

substantially at the level of the middle electrode.

the voltage at the middle electrode and the additional current are

measured and the ratio of said voltage divided by said current is
formed, said ratio being representative of the resistivity of the

current is applied at a point which is distinct from the middle

electrode.
A method of determining the resistivity of a geological formation

applying a current in a first step in such a manner as to flow substantially
only through the casing and a zone immediately adjacent to

the casing, balancing the bridge, applying in a second step a current
