<CLAIMS>
A two-terminal current clipping component
including a depleted MOS or IGBT transistor of the double

diffused vertical (VDMOS) type, characterized in that the
source metallization and gate metallization of said

transistor are made of a single metallization, and in that
the doping level of the depleted channel region is

selected so that the limiting current has a substantially
constant value as a function of the temperature.
A two-terminal current limiting component
according to claim 1, including:


a substrate (11) of a first conductivity type;
separated wells (21, 22) of the second
conductivity type, formed in the upper surface of the

substrate;
a first annular region (34) of the first
conductivity type having a high doping level in each well;
a second, shallow, annular region (38) of the
first conductivity type having a low doping level between

the outer periphery of each first annular region and the
periphery of each well;
an insulating layer (42) over the second annular
region, the portion of the first annular region adjacent

to the second annular region, and the upper surface
portions of the substrate between the wells, and

constituting a gate insulator;
a first metallization (44) coating the upper surface
of the component and constituting said gate and

source metallization; and
a second metallization coating the lower surface
of the component.
The two-terminal component of claim 2,
characterized in that it further comprises a first highly

doped peripheral region (36) of the first conductivity
type and a second peripheral inner region (24), separated

from the first peripheral region by an area of the substrate,
said second peripheral region being of the second

conductivity type and having a low doping level.
The two-terminal component of claim 2,
characterized in that it includes a central highly doped

region (26) of the second conductivity type.
The two-terminal component of claim 2,
characterized in that the central region (21) of each well

is more highly doped than the peripheral portion (22).
The two-terminal component of any of claims
2 to 5, characterized in that it includes on the lower

surface of the substrate the same wells, regions and
layer, thereby constituting a bidirectional current

limiting component.
The two-terminal component of any of claims
1 to 6, characterized in that it is solder-bonded between

two heat sinks.
A method for manufacturing a two-terminal
component according to claim 1, characterized in that the

channel region results from an implantation of the first
conductivity type formed in a peripheral region of the

second conductivity type so that the doping level of the
resulting channel is of the first conductivity type and so

that the limiting current has a substantially constant
value as a function of the temperature whereas the length

of the channel is selected to obtain a desired value for
said limiting current. 
The method for manufacturing a two-terminal
component according to claim 8, in a substrate (11) of the

first conductivity type, characterized in that it includes
the following steps implemented in the front surface of

the substrate:

forming, through a first mask, wells (21, 22) of
the second conductivity type;
forming, in each of said wells, by using the
first mask and an additional mask (29), annular regions

(34) of the second conductivity type;
implanting a dopant of the first conductivity
type by using a third mask that does not cover the peripheral

portion of each well (21-22) between the outer
portion of said well, and the annular region (34), to

invert the conductivity type of said peripheral region;
growing an oxide layer having a predetermined
thickness for gate insulation;
etching the oxide layers over the central
portions of each well, including the inner portion of each

annular region; and
forming a metallization (44) on said front
surface and in that it further comprises the step of

forming a metallization on the rear surface.

that said third mask includes portions (14-1) for

protecting intermediate areas of the substrate between
adjacent wells.
