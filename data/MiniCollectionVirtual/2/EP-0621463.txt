<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic transport system for powdered materials for 
quantifying and pneumatically transferring powdered 

materials. When materials are fed above an inclined guide 
plate (12) in a material feeder (7) with its bottom opening 

(70) closed by a valve plug (6), a slide damper (13) is 
slided to divide the materials in the feeder (7) vertically. 

An escaping space (18) is formed under the inclined guide 
plate (12) so that the materials aren't damaged when the 

slide damper (13) is moved. When the valve plug (6) is 
retracted, the materials under the slide damper (13) are fed 

into a transport plug (2) housed in a plug setting portion 
(1c). The transport plug (2) is pneumatically transported 

into a material discharge port (10) by compressed air 
supplied by air supply means (9). After the transportation 

is finished, the transport plug (2) is returned into the 
plug setting portion (1c).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic transport
system for powdered or granular materials for transporting
powdered or granular materials such as tablets or resin
pellets to a desired place by utilizing a transport plug
which is pneumatically transferred in a transport pipe.It is often required for tablets to be transported
accurately and quantitatively when tablets manufactured by a
tablet molding machine are transported to the next treatment
process. In order to cope with such a case, the applicants
of the present invention have proposed a pneumatic transport
system in JP-A-4-217513 and JP-A-4-217512 (U.S. PAT
NO.5,211,514, EP-A-0485988). According to the prior
invention, a transport plug 4e is provided in a transport
pipe 3e for transporting tablets and is pneumatically
transported to a material discharge port 10e by air pressure
supplied to the transport pipe 3e from a nozzle 9. A
material feeder 63 is provided above a material supply port
5e of the transport pipe 3e and is provided with an inclined
guide plate 60, a slide damper 61, a valve plug 6e and a
material weighing chamber 62 having a sensor S such as a
photoelectric sensor or a capacitance sensor.In such a construction, tablets A are sequentially 
filled in the material weighing chamber 62 when the valve
plug 6e closes the bottom of the chamber 62. When the level
of the tablets A stored in the chamber 62 reaches a fixed
level detected by the sensor S, the slide damper 61 is
moved. Tablets are prevented from falling into the material
weighing chamber 62 by the slide damper 61 and the inclined
guide plate 60. According to such means, the tablets A are
quantified in the material chamber 62 and housed in the
transport plug 4e by opening the valve plug 6e, enabling
quantitative transportation of tablets.Such a prior system has the following problems because
the sensor S is used to weigh the tablets A.When a photoelectric sensor is used as the sensor S,
the photoelectric sensor detects the tablets A stored in the
material weighting chamber 62, as shown in Fig.10(a), and
also detects the tablets A falling into the chamber 62, as
shown in Fig.lO(b). Such detections should be
differentiated. Such distinction can be done according to
the difference of the amount of reflecting light which the
sensor receives from the tablets A. However, its light
detection level should be properly adjusted in order to
execute the distinction.Such adjustment isn't easy and it is too difficult for
a user to adjust the sensor by himself. Therefore, when the
sensor

A pneumatic transport system with a material feeder (7)
which is integrally provided with a transport pipe (3),

for transferring powdered material by a transport plug
(4) in said transport pipe (3), wherein


said material feeder (7) comprises at a bottom thereof a
valve (6) for opening and closing a bottom opening (70)

and inside a slide damper (13) and an inclined guide
plate (12) both facing each other,
said bottom communicating with a material supply port
(5) of said transport pipe (3) through said bottom

opening(70), said inclined guide plate (12) being formed
with an escaping space (18) where material is not filled

during the charging of powdered material into said
material feeder (7) with said bottom opening (70) kept

closed by said valve (6), and wherein
furthermore said slide damper (13) is projected
under said inclined guide plate (12) so that some of the

powdered material is entered into said escaping space
(18) during the charging of the material into said

material feeder (7) over a level of said guide plate
(12) and the powdered material charged in said material

feeder (7) is divided into two blocks for measuring when
said slide damper(13) is closed, and
said transport plug (4) is constructed such that 
it moves reciprocatively up and down in said transport

pipe (3) and receives measured powdered material from
said material feeder (7) by opening said valve (6)

during said transport plug (4) remains at its waiting
position below in said transport pipe (3), then the

valve (6) is closed and thereafter said transport plug
(4) moves up in said transport pipe (3) by a pressurized

gas fed into said transport pipe (3) and discharges
powdered material at a material discharge port (10)

provided above in said transport pipe (3), whereby
powdered materials is repeatedly transported by said

transport plug (4) by measured amount.
