<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fungicidal composition and to 
methods of using the composition to combat fungal infections of plants. (E)-Methyl 2-[2-(6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate, 
its use as a fungicide, compositions containing it, and 
methods of using it to combat fungal infections of plants are disclosed in 
EP-A2-0382375. The present invention provides a fungicidal composition comprising a 
carrier or diluent; a first active ingredient which is a compound of 
formula (I), [(E)-methyl 2-[2-(6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate], 
and a second active ingredient which is a compound 
of formula (II) wherein R1 is C1-4 alkyl or C3-6 cycloalkyl(C1-4)alkyl; and 
R2 is phenyl or phenyl(C1-4)alkyl; wherein the foregoing phenyl moieties 
are substituted with halogen; the relative amounts of the first and second 
active ingredients being such as to produce a synergistic effect. Alkyl and the alkyl moieties of C3-6 cycloalkyl(C1-4)alkyl and 
phenyl(C1-4)alkyl are in the form of straight or branched chains, and are, 
for example, methyl, ethyl, n-butyl or tert-butyl. Cycloalkyl is, for example, cyclopropyl. Halogen is preferably fluorine or chlorine. The foregoing phenyl moieties are preferably 2- or 4- monosubstituted 
or 2,4- disubstituted. In one aspect the present invention provides a fungicidal composition 
wherein the second active ingredient is a compound of formula (II) in which 
R1 is a butyl group (especially n-butyl or tert-butyl) or 
1-(cyclopropyl)eth-1-yl; and R2 is mono- or di-chlorophenyl (especially 
4-chlorophenyl or 2,4-dichlorophenyl) or monochlorophenyl(C1-2)alkyl 
(especially 2-chlorobenzyl or 2-(4-chlorophenyl)eth-1-yl). In a further aspect the compound of formula (II) is a compound wherein 
R1 is n-butyl and R2 is 2,4-dichlorophenyl, or R1 is tert-butyl and R2 is 
2-chlorobenzyl or 2-(4-chlorophenyl)eth-1-y1. In another aspect there is provided a composition wherein the weight 
ratio of the first active ingredient to the second active ingredient is in 
the range from 400:1 to 10:90. In a further aspect there is provided a fungicidal composition 
comprising a carrier or diluent; a first active ingredient which is a 
compound of formula (I), and a second active ingredient which is a compound  
 
of formula (III); the relative amounts of the first and second active 
ingredients being such as to produce a synergistic effect, for example the 
weight ratio of the first active ingredient to the second active ingredient 
is in
