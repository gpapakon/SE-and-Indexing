<ABSTRACT>
Emulsifier-free coating composition in the form of an aqueous emulsion, process for its preparation, and its use. The resin component of the coating composition comprises   A) from 30 to 70 % by weight of a polyester-oligomer-polyacrylate which can be diluted with water after neutralisation with bases and is obtainable by free-radical polymerisation of from 50 to 95 % by weight of one or more esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids having hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, where   a) the hydrophobic moieties are based on monomeric esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids having secondary OH groups, which may be present as a mixture with OH-free comonomers, and b) the hydrophilic moieties are based on monomeric esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids having primary OH groups and unsaturated monomers having COOH groups, which may be present as a mixture with OH-free comonomers, the numerical ratio of the primary to the secondary OH groups in the copolymer, which groups derive from components b) and a), being from 1 : 1.5 to 1 : 2.5, in from 5 to 50 % by weight of one or more hydroxy-functional polyester-oligomers, which are obtainable by polycondensation of one or more diols and/or polyols and one or more dicarboxylic acids and/or derivatives thereof, having a calculated molecular weight of from 200 to 1000, a hydroxyl number of from 100 to 600 and an acid number of from 0 to 15, the monomers a) and b) being employed in quantities such that the polyester-oligomer-polyacrylate has a hydroxyl number of from 100 to 390 and an acid number of from 16 to 50, the percentages by weight being based in each case on the solids content and adding up to give 100 % by weight; and B) from 70 to 30 % by weight of one or more polyisocyantes having free NCO groups, the percentages by weight of components A) and B) being based in each case on the weight of the solids content of the resins and adding up to give 100 % by weight, and the ratio of OH groups in component A) to free NCO groups in components B) being from 0.5 : 1 to 2 : 1. The coating composition additionally contains water and, if desired, one or more organic solvents, pigments, fillers and/or auxiliaries and/or additives which are conventional in surface coatings.
