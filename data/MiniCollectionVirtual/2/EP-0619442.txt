<ABSTRACT>
A toothed belt with a plurality of teeth (14) 
along one surface of the belt which surface includes a 

peripheral wear-resistant fabric (20) that is double woven 
with two sets of warp yarns (26,32) and two sets of weft yarns (28,34) 

that are tied together in a single layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a toothed power 
transmission belt, but more particularly, the invention 
relates to a fabric reinforcement associated with the 
teeth of such a belt. Power transmission belts have a polymeric 
body with a plurality of teeth along at least one 
surface of the belt. Many such belts have a tensile 
member embedded in the body as a load carrying member, 
and a wear resistant fabric at the periphery of the 
surface that includes the belt teeth for reinforcing 
such teeth and inhibiting wear. The type of wear 
resistant fabric has an impact on the load carrying 
capacity of the belt teeth, and consequently, the belt 
itself. U.S. Patent No. 3,937,094 and U.S. Patent No. 
4,099,422 each disclose a toothed power transmission 
belt with trapezoidal belt teeth. The peripheral 
surface of the belt including the teeth, have two 
layers of fabric which provide a wear resistant surface 
to the teeth and structural reinforcement to the 
teeth. A problem during belt use with such a 
construction, is delamination of the two layers of 
fabric which are adhered together such as by means of a 
cement or a rubber layer. Another problem associated 
with the construction is that the two layers of fabric 
and the adhesive mechanism to preclude the fabrics from 
separating from each other, are a cost penalty in the 
manufacture of such a belt. U.S. Patent No. 4,392,842 discloses a toothed 
power transmission belt with rounded teeth formed at a  
 
surface of the belt. There are two layers of fabric 
adjacent the surface that includes the belt teeth. The 
fabrics are separated from each other with a cushion 
layer of elastomeric material so as to decrease the 
rigidity of the belt teeth in comparison to the 
previously mentioned two layer fabric constructions. 
While such a construction may be beneficial for a 
rounded toothed belt, the two layers of fabric, their 
spacing, and adhesion system for the fabric layers adds 
to the manufacturing steps and costs for producing such 
a belt. U.S. Patent No. 4,302,197 discloses a toothed 
power transmission belt with a single layer of fabric 
at the peripheral surface including the belt teeth 
where the fabric is constructed such that its outside 
has fiber with properties for abrasion resistance and 
the inside has fiber with properties for adhesion with 
the polymeric body of the belt. While such a fabric 
construction is beneficial for abrasion resistance and 
adhesion properties, it does not provide the tooth 
reinforcement exhibited by a belt construction

<CLAIMS>
A toothed power transmission belt (10) of the type 
having a polymeric body (12) with a plurality of spaced 

teeth (14) along at least one surface (16) of the belt, an 
embedded tensile member (19) and a wear resistant fabric 

reinforcement (20) disposed at a periphery (22) of the 
surface (16) including the belt teeth (14), characterised in 

that the wear resistant fabric reinforcement (20) comprises 
a multi-weave fabric with at least a first woven fabric 

layer (24,46) having a first plurality of warp (26) and weft 
(28) yarns and a second woven fabric layer (30) with a 

second plurality of warp (32) and weft (34,52) yarns and tie 
yarns (36,38) which periodically interlace warp yarns of the 

adjacent fabric layer tying the two fabric layers (24,46; 
30) together into a single fabric. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the tie yarns (36,38) are pick yarns. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the tie yarns (36,38) include weft yarns (50,54) of 

each fabric layer. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 1, 2 
or 3, wherein the yarns of each fabric layer (24,46; 30) 

have substantially the same tenacity. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 1, 2 
or 3, wherein the yarns of one fabric layer have a greater 

tenacity than yarns of the other fabric layer. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in any one of 
claim 1-5, wherein the periodic interlace of the weft 

(50,56) with warp (48,54) yarns is sufficient to preclude 
delamination of the fabric during belt use. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 4,  
 

wherein the weft yarns (50,56) periodically interlace a 
group of the warp yarns (48,54). 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 5, 
wherein the warp yarns (26,32,48,54) have a higher tenacity 

than the weft yarns (28,34,50,56). 
The power trransmission belt as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the wear resistant 

reinforcement fabric (20) is treated with a chemical 
adhesion means for chemically adhering the first (24,46) and 

second layers (30) together. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the first (24,46) and second 

(30,52) layers are of a twill weave. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the weight of one fabric layer 

is less than that of the other fabric layer. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 9, 
wherein the weight of one fabric layer is from about 60 

percent to less than 100 percent of the weight of the other 
fabric layer. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 10, 
wherein the lighter weight fabric defines a back surface 

that faces the elastomeric body. 
The power transmission belt as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein a warp yarn count of one fabric layer (24,46) is 

different from a warp yarn count of the other fabric layer 
(30,52).
