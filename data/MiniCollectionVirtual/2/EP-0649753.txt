<ABSTRACT>
A transfer medium including a transfer portion 
having a transfer characteristic capable of separating 

only a region imparted with ink. 
A mirror image of the image to be transferred is formed on the 
transfer medium (707) using an ink jet printer. The transfer medium is 

then contacted image-side down with an image support to which the image 
should be transferred and heat or pressure are applied to transfer the 

ink from the transfer medium to the image support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transfer medium
applicable for a method of forming an image by transfer,
and particularly to a transfer medium effective for
liquid ink and a method of forming an image by transfer
of ink using the transfer medium. The present invention
further concerns a method of forming an image which
enables the printing by liquid ink on various printing
media, for example, a simple textile printing using a
cloth as an image support.Printing techniques have been variously proposed
and put in practical use. In particular, as information
processing techniques have been significantly developed
in recent years, printing methods using liquid ink have
been widely used as output units of computers,
facsimiles and word processors. Of these printing
methods, an ink jet printing method is of a type with
non-impact, in which there are little generated noise 
upon printing. It is further advantageous in enabling
high speed printing, and in carrying out printing on a
plain paper sheet without any specific fixing process,
and therefore, it has been widely used.The ink jet printing method having the above
advantages has been applied for various printing media
as well as a plain paper sheet. In particular, the
application for textile printing on cloths has been
remarked. However, a textile printing apparatus is on
the industrial scale, and it is difficult for a user to
easily and freely perform the precise printing using the
above apparatus.Such an ink jet type textile printing has been
proposed, for example in Unexamined Japanese Patent
Publication No. JP-A-61-55277. It discloses a cloth used
for ink jet printing which contains a compound having no
dyeing affinity substantially against a dye to be
printed to the cloth in an amount of 0.1 to 50 wt%, and
an ink jet printing method using the cloth, thereby
preventing bleeding of the ink jet printing. However,
this method does not examine the initial feeding ability
of the cloth in the general ink jet printer, and
therefore, it is practically limited to the industrial
textile printing application. A technique for solving the above problem has been
disclosed by the applicant of the present invention in
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. JP-A-62-53492.
In this technique, a broad cloth of 100% cotton is
dipped in a solution containing the component of an ink
receiving layer and is slightly squeezed, and is then
put on a commercial reporting paper sheet, so that the
broad cloth of cotton is easily mounted on a printer,
thus ensuring the feeding

<CLAIMS>
A transfer medium comprising:

a base layer having a bonding layer and, provided thereon in that order :
a separation layer comprising a resin having a softening
temperature lower than the melting point of said bonding

layer, and
a surface layer containing a water-soluble resin which,
when wetted by droplets of an image forming water based ink,

is rendered adhesive and shows an affinity to the support to
which the image is finally transferred.
A transfer medium according to claim 1, wherein the
water-soluble resin is selected from the group consisting of

starch, casein, gelatin, maleic anhydride resin, melamine resin,
urea resin, SBR latex, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose,

polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,
hydroxycellulose and polyethylene oxide.
A transfer medium according to claim 1, wherein the
separation layer exhibits an adhesive property by the

application of pressure, heat or a combination of
pressure and heat, and is separable from the base material.
A transfer medium according to claim 1, wherein the
bonding layer has an adhesive force which is reduced by the

application of pressure, heat or a combination of
pressure and heat.
A transfer medium according to claim 1, wherein the
separation layer comprises a resin selected from the group

consisting of polyamide resin, polyester resin, epoxy resin, 
polyurethane resin, polyacrylic resin, petroleum resin, rosin

derivative, coumarone-indene resin, terpene resin, polyolefin
resin, polyvinylether resin, polyethyleneglycol resin,

elastomer, styrene-butadiene rubber and isoprene rubber.
A method of forming an image by ink transfer, comprising
the steps of:


applying a water-based liquid ink corresponding a mirror image to

the ink image on said transfer medium according to claims 1
to 5;
contacting the surface layer side of said transfer
medium with an image support to which the image should be

transferred; and

heating or pressurizing said image support from the transfer
medium side, thereby transferring the ink image by

transferring the region of the surface layer and the
separation layer where the liquid ink was applied onto said

image support.
A method of forming an image by ink transfer according
to claim 6, wherein the application of said liquid ink is

performed by ink droplet by ink jet printing.
A method of forming an image by ink transfer according
to claim 6 or 7, wherein said image support comprises a

cloth.
A printed article manufacturable by said method
according to any one of claims 6 to 8.
