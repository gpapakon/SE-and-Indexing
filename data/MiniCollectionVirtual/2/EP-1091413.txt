<ABSTRACT>
A short-length vertical channel, dual-gate, CMOS FET obtains improved
immunity to short channel effects. The FET has a plurality of vertically-extending

channel segments and a gate structure with a plurality of vertically-orientated
gate segments positioned between channel segments. A method of

fabricating the FET involves forming the plurality of channel segments and
reducing the width of the segments by subtractive oxidation in the spaces

between the channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to field effect transistors (FETs) formed in
complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs).
More particularly, the present invention relates to a new and improved planar
FET having a relatively short-length and vertically-oriented channel structure
interdigitated with a dual-gate structure to obtain fully-depleted and fully-inverted
channel operating and conductivity characteristics. Moreover, the
present invention relates to fabricating such an improved FET using
conventional CMOS fabrication techniques, including photolithographic
techniques which are incapable themselves of achieving structural widths as
small as required for the FET to obtain the fully-depleted and fully-inverted
channel operating and conductivity characteristics.During the two decades preceding this invention, the continual evolution
of semiconductor technology has seen the size or topology of transistors shrink
by about half at regular time intervals of approximately 18 months. As a result,
the density of FETs in comparably-sized ICs has doubled that the same rate. It
is predicted that this doubling effect will reach a point where physics and
economics can no longer support such increases in density, and may reach
proportions where no further density increases will be possible by using the
presently-preferred, conventional planar CMOS fabrication techniques.Conventional CMOS FETs are typically formed in a structural
configuration referred to as "planar" because the various regions of the FET are
formed in patterns established in a horizontal plane. For example, the source 
and drain regions are formed as horizontal planar structures extending
downward into a substrate from an upper horizontal surface. Similarly, the
channel structure of the FET, which extends between the source and drain
regions, is also formed as a horizontal planar structure. The gate structure
extends as a generally planar layer of material formed on top of the channel
structure. Although all of these regions and components have a vertical
dimension, the majority of their influence in the FET is achieved because of the
horizontal extent of their regions and structures. The typical CMOS fabrication
technique utilizes these planar configurations because they are easily fabricated
in a horizontal plane using conventional techniques which are directed vertically
downward onto the substrate or other structures formed on top of the substrate.The planar aspects of the conventional CMOS structures have been
recognized
