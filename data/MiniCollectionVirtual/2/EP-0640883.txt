<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chargeable resin
powder which can be used in a toner for developing
electrostatic images for use in electrophotography and
other charging-based techniques, powder coatings for
electrostatic painting, and so on.In copying machines etc. based on electrophotography,
various dry or wet toners containing a coloring agent, a
fixing resin and other substances are used to visualize the
electrostatic latent image formed on the photoreceptor
having a light-sensitive layer containing an inorganic or
organic photoconductive substance. The chargeability of
such toners is one of the most important factors in
electrostatic latent image developing systems. Thus, to
appropriately control or stabilize the amount of charges of
the toner, a charge control agent providing a positive or
negative charge is often added to the toner.Also, in recent years, in the field of electrostatic
painting, which is based on the charging phenomenon, the
utility of solvent-free powder coatings has drawn attention
from the viewpoint of painting labor saving, prevention of 
environmental pollution, ease of paint management and
others. Electrostatic powder painting methods using powder
coatings are classified into the corona charging method,
the frictional charging method and the hybrid method. In
any method, the paint powder must be given a sufficient
amount of charges.As charge control agents for controlling the charging
of (colored) resin powders such as dry toners, there have
been used electron acceptors having a good negative charge
providing property, such as azo-metal complex dyes,
aromatic oxycarboxylic acid-metal complexes and salts
thereof, and electron donors having a good positive charge
providing property, such as nigrosine dyes, triarylmethane
dyes and other basic dyes, quaternary ammonium salt
compounds, pyridinium salt compounds, imidazole compounds
and polyamine resins.Concerning electrostatic powder coatings, application
of charge control agents for electrophotographic toners is
being considered to improve painting efficiency. Such
proposals include an electrostatic powder coating
containing a resin polymer of an azine dye such as
nigrosine (dye composition) [Unexamined Japanese Patent
Publication No. 67563/1985], a resin powder composition for
electrostatic painting containing a charge enhancer such as
a metal-containing complex compound (Unexamined Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 75077/1988), a powder coating
composition containing a quaternary ammonium salt as a
charge control agent or
