<ABSTRACT>
Blunt tip cutting edge needles which are suitable 
for use in suturing cutaneous tissues of the body while 

at the same time significantly reducing the probability 
of skin penetration of the gloved hand of an operator 

are disclosed. The needle includes a blunt tip and an 
integral cutting section having at least one cutting 

edge. The blunt tip blends smoothly with an outer 
surface of a distal end of the cutting portion such that 

the blunt tip has no sharp edges or discontinuities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to surgical 
needles and, more particularly, to cutting edge and 
tapercut needles having a blunt tip for use in suturing 
cutaneous tissues of the body while at the same time 
decreasing potential skin penetration of the gloved hand 
of an operator. In the design of surgical needles it is desirable 
for the needle to easily penetrate and smoothly pass 
through the tissue being sutured. The needle should be 
designed so as to minimize the resistance of the tissue 
to the passage of the entire needle through the tissue. 
The ease of penetration is dependent upon the sharpness 
of the needle point. Once the needle has penetrated the 
tissue, the body of the needle must be drawn through the 
opening in the tissue. This should be done with minimal 
force, and the needle should be shaped so that it will 
move smoothly through the opening. With cutting edge 
needles, widening of a hole made by initial penetration 
is effected by the cutting edge(s) as they slide through 
the tissue until there is a fully developed hole. Thus, 
in the design of surgical needles, it is desirable to  
 
make the cutting edge(s) and the point of the needle as 
sharp as possible. US Patent 4660559 discloses such a cutting edge 
needle with a sharp point according to the pre-characterising portion of 
claim 1 below. Recently, another design criteria has surfaced as 
a result of the increasing awareness of the severity of 
contracting Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) through 
accidental needle sticks. The members of professions 
that must deal on a daily basis with the risk of coming 
in contact with people that do or may have HIV or AIDS 
are acutely aware of the severity. These professionals 
are therefore taking every precaution to reduce the 
risks. Members of the medical profession, especially 
surgeons, are in an extremely high risk position when 
performing operations. The knowledge that infectious 
diseases such as the AIDS virus can spread by an 
accidentally inflicted needle stick from a contaminated 
needle administered to the person having AIDS is the 
cause for much concern. Accordingly, there has been an increasing amount 
of activity in the area of surgical needle tip design. 
In order to decrease the potential transmission of the 
above infectious diseases where accidental needle stick 
is the means for such transmission, taper point surgical 
needles having a blunt tip have been developed. 
However, these needles have no cutting edges
