<ABSTRACT>
An articulated bed (10) which has the lying surface (12) consisting of a 
first fixed portion (14) and a second mobile portion (15) detached from 

said first fixed portion (14), characterized in that, starting from a 
position wherein said second mobile portion (15) lies on the same plane 

of said first fixed portion (14), said second mobile portion (15) may 
assume, with respect to said first fixed portion (14), all positions 

comprised between a first parallel raised position and a second downwards 
inclined position , an articulation (13) being also provided in order to 

move said second mobile portion (15) between said positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an articulated bed and to the 
correspondent articulation for moving at least a portion of said bed, 
said portion being detached from the rest of the bed. The articulation 
allows the motion of a second mobile portion of the lying surface 
referring to a first fixed one. In particular, the second mobile portion can assume, referring to said 
first fixed portion, all positions comprised between a first raised 
position and a second downwards inclined position. Articulated beds having the aim to satisfy all therapeutic requirements 
are well known in the Art. In particular, in some kinds of therapeutic 
treatments the patient legs have to assume positions different from the 
usual one, i.e the lying position on the same surface on which the rest 
of the patient body lies. For this purpose articulated beds showing fixed 
and mobile portions connected to each other by means of hinges have been 
proposed. This constraint restricts the possibility to have a wide 
range of positions; in fact, in order to get remarkable results several 
mobile portions hinged to each other are necessary, said portions being 
moved by means of devices. The more the articulated portions, the more 
complex the device. In order to obviate the aforesaid disadvantages, an articulated bed has 
been conceived which has the lying surface consisting of a first fixed 
portion and of a second mobile portion not linked with the first one by  
 
means of a hinge, but detached from the last one in order to assume all 
positions according to all possible therapeutic requirements, which have 
otherwise been satisfied by means of several different articulated beds. In other words, by means of a simple device it is possible to move the 
mobile portion with respect to the fixed one either by a vertical 
shifting wherein during the translation the portion remains always 
parallel to the fixed portion, or by a rotation on a fixed point. Starting from a position wherein the second mobile portion is detached 
from the first fixed one and lies on the same plane, said second mobile 
portion may assume, with respect to the first fixed portion, all 
positions comprised between a first parallel raised position and a 
second downwards inclined position, an articulation being provided in 
order to move said mobile second portion through the aforesaid positions. The articulation also object of the present invention consists of a frame 
part and of an element integral with the second mobile portion, linked to 
each other by

<CLAIMS>
An articulated bed (10) which has the lying surface (12) consisting of 
a first fixed portion (14) and a second mobile portion (15) detached from 

said first fixed portion (14), characterized in that, starting from a 
position wherein said second mobile portion (15) lies on the same plane 

of said first fixed portion (14), said second mobile portion (15) may 
assume, with respect to said first fixed portion (14), all positions 

comprised between a first parallel raised position and a second downwards 
inclined position , being also provided an articulation (13) in order to 

move said second mobile portion (15) between said positions. 
An articulated bed (10) according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the lower part of the patient body lies on said second mobile portion 

(15). 
An articulated bed (10) according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said articulation (13) consists of a frame part (17), of an element (18) 

integral with said second mobile portion (15), of a first rod (19) hinged 
at (21, 22), respectively, to said frame part (17) and to said element 

(18) and of a second rod (20) hinged at (23, 24), respectively, to said 
frame part (17) and to said element (18), said second rod (20) being 

articulated in its turn in correspondence to a hinge (35) and consisting 

of a portion (25) and a portion (26) having respectively a tooth (27) and 
a lug (28) which rest on each other, thus allowing only a rotation 

to wards a moving away direction of said lug (28) from said tooth (27), 
whereas a rotation towards an opposite direction is prevented. 
An articulated bed (10) according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the shaping of said articulation (13), and consequently of said second 

mobile portion (15), is settled by the extention of a linear actuator 
(16), the extremity of which is hinged at (29) to a lug (30) of said 

 
frame (11), whereas the other extremity is hinged at (31) to a lug (32) 

of said portion (26) of said second rod (20).
