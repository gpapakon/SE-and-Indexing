<ABSTRACT>
Proteinaceous molecules with stem cell inhibition activity are analogues of LD78 or MIP-1 alpha  which have mutations to prevent or reduce multimer formation beyond certain stages (for example a dodecamer). Aggregate formation is therefore inhibited, and the resulting low molecular weight monomers (or oligomers) have improved solution properties leading to enhanced productivity and greater therapeutic utility as stem cell protective agents, which are useful in tumour therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STEM CELL INHIBITING PROTEINSThis invention relates to proteinaceous compounds having the properties of-Λ inhibitors of stem cell proliferation. In particular, the invention relates to5 engineered variants of protein molecules with stem cell inhibition activity, their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as adjuncts to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, for example in the treatment of cancer.The diverse cells of the haemopoietic system are derived from multipotential stem10 cells by a process of sequential division and differentiation. The proliferation of the stem cell population is controlled in part by an inhibitory molecule produced by bone marrow macrophages (Lord et al., Brit. J. Haemawl. 34 441, (1976)). The murine haemopoietic stem cell inhibitor has been shown to be an 8kDa protein, macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 alpha (MIP-lα (Graham etal., Nature15 344442, (1990)). The properties of the stem cell inhibitor include protecting stem cells from the toxic effects of cell cycle specific cytotoxic agents (Lord and Wright, Blood Cells, 6581 (1980)). Stem cell inhibitors therefore have enormous clinical potential as agents to protect the stem cells from the chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimes used in tumour therapy. Additionally, stem cell inhibitors20 may be used in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases such as psoriasis, either alone or in conjunction with cytotoxic agents. Amino acid sequence homologies suggested that either the human LD78 or ACT2 gene products were the human homologues of the murine stem cell inhibitor (Figure la) (Schall, Cytokine 3 165- 183 (1991)). It has been demonstrated that the human LD78 gene product is the25 functional homologue of murine MlP-lα, (Pragnell CRC Beatson Laboratory * Scientific Report pp 21-25, (1990), Dunlop et al., Blood 79:2221-2225 (1992)).% As a component of the present invention, the secondary and tertiary structure of LD78 and MlP-lα have been shown to be almost identical. Only a difference in 

 the nature of a side-chain or charge interaction in the vicinity of Trp-57 is observed for the two proteins. Despite having a similar secondary structure toLD78 and MIP-lα, near u.v. cd. studies show ACT2 has a different tertiary conformation as highlighted by the shape and intensity of the spectrum. This provides strong evidence that LD78 and not ACT2 is the human homologue ofMlP-lα.A major problem shared by murine MlP-lα and human LD78, which limits their potential clinical utility, is that at concentrations as
