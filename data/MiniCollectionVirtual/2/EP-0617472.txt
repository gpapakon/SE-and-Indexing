<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to optical 
interconnects for semiconductor devices. As semiconductor integrated circuit technology 
progresses, circuit designers are continually striving to 
improve circuit performance. One enhancement that can 
significantly improve circuit performance is increasing of 
circuit speed. Circuit speed can be increased by improving 
interconnections between components and/or chips. 
Traditionally, conventional wiring has been used for such 
interconnections. Disadvantages commonly associated with 
conventional wiring schemes include excessive noise, 
significant delay time, crosstalk, etc. These 
disadvantages can adversely affect circuit speed, and thus 
must be taken into consideration by an integrated circuit 
designer when attempting to optimize circuit speed by 
improving interconnections. An alternative to conventional wiring is optical 
interconnects. Many of the disadvantages associated with 
conventional wiring do not exist with optical 
interconnects, and thus optical interconnects can increase 
circuit speed. Accordingly, utilization of optical 
interconnects can be attractive for circuit designers 
seeking to enhance and improve semiconductor circuit 
performance. Optical interconnects have previously been implemented 
with direct bandgap material in Group III-V semiconductor 
technology, particularly gallium arsenide based technology. 
As a matter of fact, in GaAs based technology, use of 
optical interconnects is well known and commonplace, and 
has been proven to operate faster and function more 
effectively than wires, by eliminating the above-outlined 
problems associated with wires. In this regard, it has 
been demonstrated in GaAs based technology that direct  
 
bandgap material can be readily made to lase or emit light 
for forming optical interconnects. However, in contrast to direct bandgap material in 
Group III-V semiconductor technology, optical interconnects 
are not as readily implemented with indirect bandgap 
material in Group IV semiconductor technology, particularly 
silicon based technology, bipolar or CMOS. Since indirect 
bandgap material does not ordinarily emit light, it is 
especially difficult to build a light emitting device or 
optical interconnect from such material. Specifically, since it is apparent that two-dimensional 
Si-Ge quantum wells have no light emission capability, one-dimensional 
or quantum dots (zero-dimensional) are required 
in a Si-Ge based technology.
