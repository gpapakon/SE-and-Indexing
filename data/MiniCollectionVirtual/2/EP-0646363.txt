<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a medical 
instrument cleaning method and apparatus suitable for 

thoroughly cleaning medical instruments, particularly 
instruments used in dental treatment and with strongly 

adhesive deposits such as cement and the like. 
The instrument cleaning process according to 
the present invention comprising a boiling step of 

boiling instruments with deposits thereon in a boiling 
vessel, allowing water to soak into the deposits, a 

drying step of drying the boiled instruments with hot 
air in a drying vessel to dry the water-soaked deposits, 

and a washing step of washing the dried instruments in a 
washing vessel to remove the dried deposits. 
Thus, the instruments with deposits thereon 
are boiled in the boiling step, in which water soaks 

into the deposits, then the boiled instruments are dried 
in the drying step, whereby the water soaked into the 

deposits is evaporated to weaker the adhesive force of 
the deposits, and subsequently the dried instruments are 

washed in the washing step, whereby the deposits which 
have been made less adhesive are removed from the 

instruments. In this way the instruments with deposits 
can be cleaned to a satisfactory extent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for cleaning medical instruments and more particularly
a cleaning method and apparatus for removing deposits on
metallic instruments used in dental treatment.Heretofore, in dental treatment, there have
been used various metallic instruments, including
stopper, probe, excavator and pincette, for applying a
medicine to an affected part of a patient, grinding a
tooth, filling a tooth with a temporary sealant, or
fixing a tooth crown through an adhesive. Since the
materials which have been used in the dental treatment
are deposited on those instruments, the instruments are
washed after use to remove such deposits and keep the
instruments in good hygienic condition.As the aforesaid temporary sealant or adhesive
there usually is employed cement which has a strong
adhesive force. When such a highly adherent material is 
deposited on a medical instruments it is removed by using a dedicated cleaning
apparatus.According to the said cleaning apparatus, medical instruments which have been
used in medical treatments and with deposits thereon can be washed together, and as
this type of a cleaning apparatus there is known an ultrasonic washing apparatus
wherein a washing basket containing medical instruments is immersed in a washing
vessel containing a washing solution and ultrasonic waves are fed by turning a switch
ON to effect cleaning automatically (see, for example, USP 4710233, USP 3937236 and
DE 3934928).US-A-5197499 describes a process for the care and servicing of medical and
dental instruments which includes initially cleaning them by blowing cold air into or
onto them, rinsing them with water, boiling them in a water bath to disinfect them,
drying them with hot air and oil, and removing excess oil by blowing with hot air under
increased pressure.Also known is an ultrasonic washing apparatus comprising a plurality of vessels
and which automatically performs not only washing of medical instruments but also
rinsing and drying of the washed instruments (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid
Open No. 115680/81). According to this known apparatus, a rinsing vessel for rinsing
medical instruments alter washing and a drying vessel for drying the rinsed instruments,
in addition to a washing vessel for washing medical instruments using ultrasonic waves,
are arranged side by side in a row within the same apparatus, and medical instruments
contained in a washing basket are 
conveyed to those vessels successively by means of
conveyance mechanism.However, such
