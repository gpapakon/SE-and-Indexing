<ABSTRACT>
An improved vision tester apparatus and method are disclosed for use in conducting optometric examinations of patients who use video display terminals (VDTs). Specifically, the tester simulates images that are displayed to the patient by a typical VDT, so as to facilitate prescribing corrective lenses that will perform well for the patient when used with an actual VDT. The tester (10) includes a flat-panel electroluminescent light source (32) for illuminating a screen (14) without hot spots. The screen includes a colored ink layer (78, 80, 82) and an opaque ink mask (70) for forming pixel-like light elements (24). Lensing structures (52, 56, 58, 60) degrade the image such that each light element exhibits a generally Gaussian light amplitude curve (Fig. 5B) characteristic of a pixel of an actual VDT. A rechargeable battery (34) coupled to an inverter circuit (30) provides portable power for the EL panel to complete a compact, portable tester.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPUTER DISPLAY SCREEN SIMULATION FOR OPTOMETRIC EXAMINATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of application serial number 07/665,903, filed March 7, 1991 , now U.S. Patent No. which is a continuation-in-part of application number 07/282,596, filed December 12, 1988, now U.S. Patent No. 4,998,820.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to vision testing equipment and more specifically to instruments and methods for use in conducting optometric examinations.As use of the video display termina' ("VDT") has become more widespread, for example in connection v iih computers, so too have certain ophthalmological problems associated v '< <ts use become more common. A recent survey of optometrists, reported ir. me J. Am. Optom. Assoc. 1992 (vol. 63, pp 687-92), shows that more than 14% of optometric patients present with symptoms primarily associated with use of the VDT, or almost 10 million examinations annually when projected to the U.S. population. Responding optometrists were unable to confidently arrive at a diagnosis and treatment more frequently for VDT patients (20.87%) compared to non-VDT patients (14.05%).Alphanumeric characters displayed on video display screens are made up of dots or pixels which do not have well defined borders and therefore are difficult for the eye to focus upon. Further, since video screens are maintained at a constant distance of about 50 cm from the user's eyes, the same eye muscles are in constant use in focusing on the screens. These factors cause significant amounts of stress and fatigue on the eyes of video display terminal users which are often aggravated by the fact that many such 

users utilize their computers for extended periods on a daily basis. The stress associated with video display use frequently results in peculiar types of eye problems requiring special corrective prescriptions in the spectacles selected for the users suffering from these problems.In order to accurately diagnose these problems, appropriate test equipment and test procedures must be provided. In accordance with the process currently used by medical practitioners to determine the spectacle requirements of typical patients, an apparatus (phoropter) is placed in front of the eyes of the patient which enables the doctor to rapidly change a wide selection of lenses while the patient views a set of test images through the lens changing apparatus. As the patient focuses on the test images, the doctor assesses the status of the muscles inside the patient's eyes and judges
