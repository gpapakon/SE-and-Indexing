<ABSTRACT>
This osteosynthesis staple is made of a thermoelastic martensitic alloy whose martensitic Ms and austenitic As transformation temperatures can vary, depending on the applications, between -20 DEG C and 70 DEG C. It comprises side branches (2, 3, 4, 9) intended to be inserted on either side of the site of the fracture of a bone to be repaired, the said side branches being connected together by at least one connection portion (5, 6, 7, 8), the side branches and the connection portion (5 - 8) being taut in order respectively to curve substantially towards the centre of the staple and to shorten under the effect of temperature when it exceeds the austenitic transformation temperature As of the said material. It consists of a single and monobloc wire consisting of the said alloy, with which at least one (2) of the side branches (2, 3, 4, 9) constituting it is made by at least partial folding of the said wire onto itself.

A monobloc osteosynthesis clip made of a thermoelastic 
martensitic alloy, the martensitic and austenitic 

transformation temperatures M

by at least one connection portion (5, 6, 7, 8), the side 

branches and the connection portion being educated in 
order respectively to bend substantially towards the 

center of the clip and to shorten under the effect of 
temperature when it exceeds the austenitic transformation 

temperature A
s

unitary wire consisting of said alloy, with which at least 

one (2) of the side branches (2, 3, 4, 9) which 
constitute it is made by at least partial folding back of 

said wire on itself. 
The osteosynthesis clip as claimed in claim 1,wherein two 
(3, 4) of the side branches consist of the two ends of the 

wire. 
The osteosynthesis clip as claimed in claim 2, wherein any 
additional side branch (9) is made by partial folding back 

of the wire on itself. 
The osteosynthesis clip as claimed in one of claims 1 to 
3, wherein a part of the connection portion (7, 8) of the

greater than the austenitic transformation temperature of 

the martensitic material which constitutes it, consists of  
 

partial folding back on itself of the wire which 
constitutes it in the extension of the side branch (2) 

thus constituted, the shortening being obtained by 
adoption by said portion of a curved or corrugated 

profile. 
The osteosynthesis clip as claimed in one of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the shortening of the connection portion of the 

clip at a temperature greater than the austenitic 
transformation temperature of the martensitic material 

which constitutes it is obtained by partial folding down 
of the unitary extensions (5, 6) of said portion in the 

direction of the side branch (2, 9) consisting of the

constitutes it. 
The osteosynthesis clip as claimed in one of claims 4 and 
5, wherein the shortening of the connection portion of the 

clip at a temperature greater than the austenitic 
transformation temperature of the martensitic material 

which constitutes it is obtained by combined effect of the 
adoption of a curved profile by the zone of said portion 

(7,8) consisting of partial folding back on itself of the 
wire constituting the clip and of the folding down in the 

direction of the side branch (2,9) of the unitary zones 
(5,6) of said clip. 
The osteosynthesis clip as claimed in one of claims 1 to 
6, wherein it includes three side branches (2,3,4),

portion as well as the side branches (3,4) extending them

The osteosynthesis clip as claimed in claim 7,wherein each 
strand of wire of the side branch (2) is furthermore 

educated to adopt a corrugated or curved profile when
