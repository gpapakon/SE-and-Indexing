<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for curing chloroprene/sulfur 
copolymers which do not form nitrosamines. Conventional chloroprene/sulfur-copolymers are in general made 
by radical induced emulsion polymerization of chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene) 
in the presence of elementary sulfur and, if 
required for certain applications, of a copolymerizable diene such 
as 2,3 dichloro-1,3-butadiene or an acrylic derivative. The highly 
viscous polymers so formed are plasticized by treating the latex 
with a peptization system. Such systems are usually based on 
thiurams (1) and/or dithiocarbamates (2), which are known to 
form carcinogenic nitrosamines (3) during processing and storing 
of the rubber, the compounds and the final article. 
 
U.S.-A-3,984,609 to Branlard et al. describes the peptization 
of chloroprene/sulfur copolymers, made in the presence of a 
modifying agent such as iodoform or a dialkylxanthogen disulfide,  
 
by adding to alkaline latexes of such copolymers a modifying 
agent which is a thiol of the formula R-SH wherein R includes, 
amongst other groups, an arylthiazole so as to give 
mercaptobenzothiazole as the modifying agent. The curing 
systems used with these copolymers use a nitrosamine forming 
accelerator, i.e., 2-mercaptoimidazoline. Nitrosamine formation with the above systems can be avoided by 
curing the copolymers with metal oxides alone or omission of 2-mercaptoimidazoline 
as an accelerator. However, in these cases 
there is an insufficient cure. A goal in the rubber industry is to provide the outstanding 
processability of conventional chloroprene/sulfur copolymers, 
which use thiurams as peptizing agents, while at the same time 
avoiding the formation of nitrosamines. The processability of 
such copolymers is characterized by (1) further peptizability 
during compounding and curing, (2) reasonably long storage 
stability for safe handling and low scorch, and (3) high rate and 
final state of cure when cured by metal oxides only. The present 
invention meets this goal. According to the present invention there is provided a 
process for curing a chloroprene/sulfur copolymer peptized 
in an alkaline dispersion by a xanthogen disulfide alone or 
in combination with mercaptobenzothiazole which comprises 
curing said copolymer with a metal oxide in the presence of 
N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazyl-sulfenamide or mercaptobenzothiazole 
disulfide as an accelerator and in the absence of 
nitrosamine forming additives. A realistic alternative to the peptization of
