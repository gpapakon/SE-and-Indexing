<ABSTRACT>
The receptacle (18) has a receiving cavity (34) able to accommodate overvoltage protection devices (15) of various dimensions, and it contains three elastic contacts, including two line contacts (21, 22) each with two contact strips (39, 40-41, 42) and an earth contact (20) with a contact clip (45, 46). A thermofusible insulating shim (52) is inserted between four additional earth lugs (47 to 50) and the body (24) of the overvoltage protection device (15) so as to ensure that the latter is short-circuited in the event of operation due to a lightning strike.

<CLAIMS>
Plug-in protection module on the protection ring (2) receiving a rapid
interconnection module (1) for telephone lines, this ring (2) presenting three

terminals (10, 11, 12) for connection, by plugging, to this protection module (14),
including one earth terminal (10) and two line terminals (11, 12), this protection

module (14) containing a three-pole lightning or overvoltage arrester (15) with
cylindrical body (24) and provided with a median annular metallic earth electrode

(28) and with two metallic line electrodes (25, 26) forming the two respective
transverse end faces of the cylinder, and being designed to be plugged on this

receiving ring (2) so as electrically to connect the two end electrodes (25, 26) of
the overvoltage arrester (15) respectively to the two line terminals (11, 12) and the

median annular electrode (28) of this overvoltage arrester to the earth terminal
(10), 
characterized:
in that
 it comprises, in a receptacle (18) for receiving the overvoltage arrester
(15), three elastic metal contacts (21,20,22), including a median earth

connection contact (20) whose transverse section presents the form of a fork
(23, 46, 45) with two tines (46, 45) which is provided to receive, between

these two tines (46, 45), the median annular earth electrode (28) of the
overvoltage arrester (15), and two line connection contacts (21, 22) which

are respectively positioned on either side of this earth contact (20) and
symmetrically with respect to the median transverse plane (61) thereof, each

of these two contacts being provided to elastically abut respectively against
the two line electrodes (25, 26) of the overvoltage arrester (15),
in that
 said receptacle (18) presents inner dimensions slightly greater than
the average dimensions of an overvoltage arrester available on the market

(15, 29), with the result that, taking into account the clearance allowed by
the elasticity of these three elastic contacts (21, 20, 22), this receptacle (18)

is able to receive commercially available overvoltage arresters whose outer
dimensions may be slightly different from one another,
in that
 said median elastic earth connection contact (20) is in the form of a
cradle which comprises, in the longitudinal direction parallel to the axis of

the overvoltage arrester (15) and on either side of each of the two elastic 
earth connection lugs (45, 46) which form the two tines of said fork

(23, 45, 46), respectively two additional elastic metal lugs (47, 49 and
48, 50) which are shaped in order respectively to abut on each of the two line

electrodes (25, 26) of the overvoltage arrester (15), an insulating wedge (52)
made of thermofusible material being further provided to be inserted

between each of these four additional elastic lugs (47 to 50) and the body
(24) of the overvoltage arrester (15), in order normally to form an

electrically insulating gap between each additional lug (47, 48 - 49, 50) and
its conjugated line electrode (25, 26) of the overvoltage arrester, this

insulating gap being eliminated when, the overvoltage arrester (15) having
just been operated, this insulating wedge (57 to 60) then melts under the

effect of the heat, and
in that
 this thermofusible wedge (52) comprises four adjusting tabs
(57, 58, 59, 60) which are respectively able to fit, when said wedge (52) is

positioned, between each of said additional elastic metal lugs
(47, 48, 49, 50).
Protection module according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 this insulating wedge
(57 to 60) is integrated integral with the cover (54) for closing said receptacle (18).
Plug-in protection of module according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each of
these two line connection contacts (21, 22) comprises two elastic contact strips

(39, 40) which are spaced apart from each other and shaped to abut on the
peripheral portion (43) of the metallic transverse end face (25) of the cylinder

formed by the body (24) of the overvoltage arrester (15), i.e. on the peripheral
portion (43) of the transverse face of the corresponding line electrode (25) of the

overvoltage arrester (15), so that this receptacle (18) may receive both
commercially available overvoltage arresters (29) for which this metallic

transverse end face is strictly flat (32) and commercially available overvoltage
arresters (15) for which this metallic transverse end face presents a hollow central

portion (27). 
Protection module according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
receiving cavity (34) of said receptacle (18) is made much deeper than is simply

necessary for receiving an overvoltage arrester (15, 29) in order to be able to give
to contacts (20, 21, 22) a sufficient height to obtain a good elasticity of their

contact strips (39 to 42, 45 to 50), and 
in that
 there are provided in order to avoid
the overvoltage arrester (15, 29) falling in the bottom of this cavity (34), at least

two retaining bows (35, 36) which are prominent with respect to the bottom of this
cavity (34) and which form an insulating receiving cradle for the overvoltage

arrester (15, 29).
