<ABSTRACT>
A selective calling receiver with selectable 
alerting means has a plurality of alerting means (9-16) for 

indicating an incoming call, a setting unit (8) for setting 
at least one of the alerting means to operate in 

response to an incoming call and a period of time for 
which the alerting means is to operate, a memory (17) for 

storing a setting made by the setting unit, and a 
control unit (6,7) for referring to the setting stored by the 

memory when an incoming call arrives and operating the 
alerting device based on the setting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a selective
calling receiver with selectable alerting means, and
more particularly to a selective calling receiver with
selectable alerting means for reliably alerting the
user of an incoming call.Heretofore, selective calling receivers, e.g. GB-A-2 243 507, with
selectable alerting means have generally had an
alerting device for acoustically alerting the user of
an incoming call. Recently, there have been proposed
selective calling receivers that inform the user of an
incoming call through vibration or light to allow the
user to recognize the incoming call reliably or to meet
different conditions in which the user carries the
receiver. For example, a selective calling receiver
provides a choice of a buzzer sound, vibration, or
light for indicating an incoming call, and the user may
select one of these mediums in advance as a call
indicator. When an incoming call arrives, the
selective calling receiver informs the user of the 
incoming call through the selected medium. In this
way, the incoming call is indicated by the medium
desired by the user, with the result that the user can
detect an incoming call with high reliability.JP-A-2-27936 and
GB-A-2 245 091 disclose a selective calling receiver having an
acoustic alerting device for effectively alerting the
user of an incoming call in a desired alerting pattern.However, since conventional selective calling
receivers are arranged to selectively operate the
alerting device, the user may fail to recognize an
incoming call. For example, if the user selects
vibration as the call indicating medium, the user will
fail to detect an incoming call if the user
places the selective calling receiver in a pocket of a
jacket and then carries the jacket by hand, or if the
user selects a buzzer sound as the call indicator, the
user may not hear the buzzer sound due to surrounding
noise.Generally, receivers of the type described above
have a display unit for displaying the message of an
incoming call when such an incoming call arrives, so
that the user can visually confirm the incoming call.
When the user forgets to confirm the incoming call,
however, the message of the incoming call remains 
unread for a long period of time, with the result that
the user cannot reliably detect an incoming call.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a selective calling receiver with selectable
alerting means for allowing the user to detect an
incoming call with increased probability.Another object of the present invention is to
provid

<CLAIMS>
A selective calling receiver with selectable
alerting means (100) comprising:


a plurality of alerting means (12, 14a, 14b, 16, 107) for indicating
an incoming call;
memory means (17) for storing a setting made by
setting means (8, 101, 102, 103, 104) ; and
control means (6) for referring to the setting
stored by said memory means (17) when an incoming call

arrives, and operating the alerting means (12, 14a, 14b, 16, 107) based on the
setting, characterized by
setting means (8, 101, 102, 103, 104) for setting at any time at
least one of said alerting means (12, 14a, 14b, 16, 107) to operate in response

to an incoming call and a period of time for which the
alerting means (12, 14a, 14b, 16, 107) is to operate;
said
setting means (8, 101, 102, 103, 104) comprises means for making a setting for

selectively operating a single alerting device, a
setting for selecting simultaneous operation of a

plurality of alerting devices, and a setting for
selecting successive operation of a plurality of

alerting devices.
A selective calling receiver with selectable
alerting means (100) according to claim 1, wherein said

alerting means include an alerting means (12, 107) for alerting
an incoming call with emitted light, an alerting means (14a, 14b)

for alerting an incoming call with a buzzer sound, an
alerting means (14a, 14b) for alerting an incoming call with a

melodic sound, and an alerting means (16) for alerting an
incoming call with vibration.
A selective calling receiver with selectable
alerting means (100) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said

setting means (8, 101, 102, 103, 104) comprises a plurality of switches, and
means for setting said at least one of the alerting

means and said period of time with a sequence in which
said switches are to be pressed.
A method of establishing a setting in a
selective calling receiver with selectable alerting

means (100) comprising a plurality of alerting means (12, 14a, 14b, 16, 107) for
indicating an incoming call,

memory means (17) for storing a setting made
by setting means (8, 101, 102, 103, 104), and control means (6) for referring 

to the setting stored by said memory means (17) when an
incoming call arrives and operating the alerting means (12, 14a, 14b
, 16, 107)
based on the setting, said method is characterized by the step

of setting said at least one of the alerting means (12, 14a, 14b, 16, 107) and
said period of time at any time with a sequence in which said

switches are to be pressed

selectively operating a single alerting device, a
setting for selecting simultaneous operation of a

plurality of alerting devices, and a setting for
selecting successive operation of a plurality of

alerting devices.
