<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a detergent 
composition having a remarkably low degree of irritation 
to the skin of the body, a high degree of resistance to 
hard water, a low critical micelle concentration (cmc), 
and a low Krafft point. A large number of anionic surface-active agents 
have been used as detergents on the basis of their 
excellent surface-active characteristics. The anionic 
surface-active agents that can be used as detergents for 
washing kitchen appliances such as dishes or as shampoos 
for washing or rinsing the body or the hair are required 
to be extremely low in causing irritation to the skin of 
the human body because they are always used in a state 
that they are in contact with the skin of the human body. 
Hence, the number of anionic surface-active agents which 
are used in contact with the body are limited and they 
include, for example, polyoxyethylene alkyl-sulfuric acid 
esters, alpha-olefin sulfonic acid esters, acidic N-acyl 
amino acids, alkyloyl alkyl taurine salts, acyl 
isothionates, alkyl ether carboxylic acids, higher fatty 
acids, alkyl phosphoric acid ester and alkyl sulfuric 
acid esters. On the other hand, recently, alpha-sulfo-fatty 
acid methyl esters are gaining increasing attention in 
terms of their cleansing performance in the field of 
detergents for washing clothes, which are not required to 
be used in contact with the skin of the human body. 
The alpha-sulfo-fatty acid methyl esters have received a 
growing attention in the field of detergents for washing 
the clothes because they are prepared from natural fats 
oil, such as palm oil.  
 However, if the alpha-sulfo-fatty acid methyl 
esters are used for detergents for washing dishes and 
other kitchen appliances such as dishes and for washing 
the body or the hair, which are required to be employed 
in contact with the human body, those detergents suffer 
from the disadvantage because the alpha-sulfo-fatty acid 
methyl esters are irritating to the human body. For such 
reasons, the alpha-sulfo-fatty acid methyl esters are not 
applied to a significant extent to detergents for washing 
kitchen appliances. If it would be possible to find a 
surface-active alpha-sulfo-fatty acid methyl ester having 
a low degree of irritation to the skin or the body, 
useful for kitchen appliances and applicable to a variety 
of fields, it would be extremely advantageous from the 
industrial point of view because these detergents are 
prepared from raw materials rich in the tropical area of 
the world. US-A-3808200
