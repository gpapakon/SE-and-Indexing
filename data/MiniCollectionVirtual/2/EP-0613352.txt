<ABSTRACT>
A universal joint assembly for a dental abutment implant, comprising a support body (26; 130) which is adapted to be mounted within the alveolar bone (120) of a patient, either directly or by way of an implant body (30), an abutment post fixed rigidly to a ball (42) for the eventual support of a dental crown, and a generally annular securing means (46; 134) which embraces at least part of the ball (42) and which can lock the ball in a selected attitude relative to the support body (26; 130).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a
universal joint by which a dental abutment member,
usually in the form of a post, can be coupled to a
support member which, in use, is adapted to be
implanted into the jaw of a patient.It is well known in dental surgery to implant
abutment posts into the jaw bone to provide anchor
points for the location of individual artificial
teeth, or sets of teeth, dental bridges and the like.
In many situations, the dental surgeon wishes, for
clinical reasons, to dispose the post in an attitude
which is incompatible with the optimum implant
direction within the jaw. For example, the optimum
implant direction might be perpendicular to the jaw
bone while the ideal attitude for the post, as far as
a dental bridge to be supported thereby is concerned,
is at some angle to the perpendicular.It is already known in principle that this
problem can be overcome by the use of a universal type
joint arranged between the post and a separate,
implanted body.A known universal joint comprising the features of the preamble of
claim 1 and claim 14 is
illustrated in Fig. 12 of the accompanying drawings.
It comprises a support member 10 which is adapted to
be implanted into the jaw by a dental surgeon in a
conventional manner. Screwed into the top of the
support member 10 is a screw-threaded spigot 12 which
has a ball portion 14 formed at that end which
projects from the support member 10. The ball portion
14 of the spigot 12 is received within the hollow
interior of an abutment post 16 and is forced against
a reduced diameter, bevelled mouth 18 of the post 16 
by means of a grub-screw 20 which engages a screw-thread
22 formed on the interior surface of the post
16. Initially, the grub-screw is removed from the
post 16 and the ball portion 14 is therefore loose
within the post. To assemble the joint in its
operational position, the screw-threaded portion of
the spigot 12 is first screwed into the support member
10, for example by means of a tool passed along the
post 16. The grub-screw 20 is then inserted and
partially tightened against the ball portion 14. With
the components in this condition, the angle and
attitude of the post 16 relative to the axis of the
spigot 12 and support member 10 can be adjusted to
comply with that required by the dental surgeon for
correct fitting of the eventual denture to be mounted
on that post. The grub-screw can then be further
turned so as to force the ball portion 14 into
abutment with the narrowed mouth portion 18 of the
post 16 and thereby fix the

<CLAIMS>
A universal joint assembly for a dental
abutment implant, comprising an elongate support body

(26) which is adapted to be mounted within the alveolar
bone of a patient so as to leave a face (27) thereof,

at or adjacent one axial end of the support body (26),
exposed from said bone; an abutment post (40) fixed

rigidly to a ball (42), and a securing means (46) which
embraces at least part of the ball (42) and which is adapted to

lock the ball (42) in a selected attitude relative to
said support body (26), characterised in that the

support body (26) has a recess (36) in said face (27)
and the securing means (46) is adapted to cooperate

with the support body (26) to selectively clamp the
ball (42) to the recess (36).
An assembly as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said recess (36) is part-spherical.
An assembly as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said recess (36) is conical.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 1
to 3, in which the support body (26) is adapted to be

mounted in the alveolar bone by way of a separate
implant body member (30) which is itself adapted to be

located within a hole in the alveolar bone, the support
body (26) being screwed into said implant body (30).
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 1
to 4, wherein the securing member (46) comprises an

annular cap having a body portion (100) which is flared
outwardly towards one end, the flared portion defining

a radial shoulder portion (102) containing a plurality
of bores (106) for use in rotating the securing member

into its operational position on said implant body
member.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 1
to 3, in which the support body (26) is adapted to be 

mounted directly within the alveolar bone and itself
defines an anvil against which the ball (42) is urged

by the securing means (46).
An assembly as claimed in claim 6,
wherein the support body comprises an elongate metallic

member (130) having an outwardly flared portion (132)
at its one end which receives the ball/abutment post,

said outwardly flared portion having an internal screw-threaded
recess (133) into which the securing means

(134) can be screwed for securing the ball/abutment
post to the support body.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 1
to 7, in which the securing means (46) comprises an

annular member through which the abutment post/ball
projects and which carries an internal thread (52)

which engages with an external thread (32) on the
support member.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims 1
to 7, in which the securing means (46) comprises an

annular member (134) through which the abutment
post/ball projects and which carries an external thread

(137) which engages with an internal thread (135) on
the support member.
An assembly as claimed in claim 8 or 9,
in which the annular securing means has a part-spherical

recess (139) on its underside for engaging
the ball.
An assembly as claimed in claim 10, in
which the co-operating surfaces of the ball and part-spherical

recess on the securing means are non-smooth
so as to increase the friction therebetween.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims
1 to 7, for use in cases of severe angulation, wherein

the securing means comprises a multi-part arrangement,
including a first domed part (92) having an eccentric

aperture (96) through which the abutment post/ball 
project and a second securing ring part (94) which can

selectively clamp the first, domed part (92) to the
support member.
An assembly as claimed in any of claims
1 to 12, in which the abutment post is screw-threaded

at one end and is received with a correspondingly
screw-threaded bore in the ball to enable the ball and

abutment post to be rigidly fixed together in a
releasable manner.
A universal joint assembly for a dental
abutment implant, comprising an elongate, generally

cylindrical support body (130) which is adapted to be
mounted within the alveolar bone of a patient so as to

leave one axial end face (151) thereof exposed from
said bone; an abutment post (147) fixed rigidly to a

ball (145); and an annular securing means (134) which
embraces at least part of the ball (145); characterised

by an internally threaded cavity (133) in said one end
face of said support body (130) disposed such that

there remains an annular surface portion (142) of said
one end face (151) around said cavity (133); and the

annular securing means (134) having an external screw-thread
in threaded engagement with the internally

threaded cavity (133) of the support body (130) for
locking the ball (145) in a selected attitude relative

to the support body (130); said annular portion (142)
of said one end face (151) of the support body (130)

defining a tooth receiving surface on which, in use, a
tooth (136) mounted over said abutment post (147) is

received.
