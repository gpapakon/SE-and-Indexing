<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a windscreen wiper made up of a section exhibiting a dorsal part (2) intended for mechanical connection to the waffle tree and a movable wiper lip (4), the dorsal part (2) and the lip (4) being connected by a hinge (24) allowing an excursion of the wiper lip (4) with respect to a mid position, the said dorsal part (2) exhibiting at least one bearing zone (32, 34) entering into surface contact with one complementary bearing surface (36, 38) of the wiper lip (4) when the latter is in an inclined position. The section is symmetric with respect to the midplane (6) of the dorsal part (2) and of the lip (4) and the bearing surface (36, 38) of the wiper lip (4) includes a substantially horizontal planar surface (35, 37) followed by an inclined surface (36, 38) forming an angle (A) with the bearing zone (32, 34) of the dorsal part, said angle corresponding to the maximum angle of excursion (B) of the plane of symmetry of the blade with respect to the midplane (6).

A screen wiper blade comprising a profiled member
having a dorsal portion (2) adapted for mechanical

connection with the system of stirrups, together with a
movable wiping lip (4), the dor
sal portion (2) and the
lip (4) being joined together by a hinge (24)

constituted by a thin portion (24) which enables the
wiping lip (4) to be displaced with respect to a median

position, the said dorsal portion (2) having at least
one engagement zone (32, 34) entering into surface

contact with a complementary engagement surface (36,
38) of the wiping lip (4) when the latter is in an

inclined position, the profiled member being
symmetrical with respect to the median plane (6) of the

dorsal portion (2) and lip (4) when the lip is not
being subjected to an applied force causing flexion,

characterised in that the engagement surface (36, 38)
of the wiping lip (4) includes a flat surface (35, 37)

which is substantially at right angles to the median
plane (6) of the dorsal portion (2), and which is

extended by the engagement surface (36, 38) which is
also flat, the said engagement surface (36, 38) being

inclined so as to define an angle (A) with the
engagement zone (32, 34) of the dorsal portion, the

said angle corresponding to the angle of maximum
displacement (B) of the plane of symmetry of the lip

with respect to the median plane (6), so that after
tilting displacement of the lip (4), the surface

contact has been established along the whole length of
the lip (4) and dorsal portion (2). 
A screen wiper blade according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the engagement zone (32, 34) of

the dorsal portion (2) is substantially at right angles
to the median plane (6).
A screen wiper blade according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the lower edge of the dorsal

portion (2) has an inclined engagement zone (32, 34)
which defines, with a complementary engagement surface

(36, 38) formed on the upper edge of the wiping lip
(4), an angle (A) corresponding to the angle of maximum

displacement (B) from the median plane (6).
A screen wiper blade according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the tangential

plane (H) of the zones (32, 34) of the shoulder (11) of
the dorsal portion (2) are in substantial coincidence

with the tangential plane (P) of the surfaces (36, 38)
of the wiping lip (4) when the latter is in an inclined

position.
