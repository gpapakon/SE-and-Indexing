<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bag-like cover (1) for furniture during transportation, which cover is composed of a bottom and a top part (2, 3). The top part consists of a thicker and rougher textile material, while the bottom part is of trough-shaped and multi-layer construction, the inner layer (5) consisting of a thinner and finer textile material, the outer layer (4) of a thicker and rougher textile material and the middle layer (6) of a nonwoven. The trough-shaped bottom part consists of a base part (7) and four side parts (8), said side parts being sewn to one another and to the base part. It is advantageous for the nonwoven of the side parts and of the base part to be covered by the thinner and finer textile material and for the covers of the individual parts to be sewn together and for the trough (18) thus resulting to be attached releasably to the outer layer of the bottom part.
