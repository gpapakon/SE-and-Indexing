<ABSTRACT>
A spark ignition engine with a fuel injector for 
injecting fuel directly into the cylinder comprising a 

hollow combustion chamber (2) formed on an upper surface of 
a piston (1), an ignition plug (4) inserted into the vicinity 

of the side wall of the combustion chamber at an 
ignition timing by the movement of the piston, a fuel 

injector (7) for injecting fuel toward the side wall of the 
combustion chamber in at least one predetermined engine 

driving condition, and at least one fuel guide passage (5) 
for leading fuel injected by the fuel injector into the 

vicinity of the inserting position, in the combustion 
chamber, into which the ignition plug is inserted. The 

fuel guide passage passes through the vicinity of said 
inserting position. Each wall constructing the fuel 

guide passage and each extended phantom surface of each 
wall are arranged not to cross the ignition portion 

provided at the tip of the ignition plug in spite of 
the piston position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spark 
ignition engine with a fuel injector injecting fuel 
directly into the cylinder. Japanese Patent Application No. 4-41102 filed 
by the same applicant discloses an engine which 
comprises a hollow combustion chamber formed on an upper 
surface of the piston, a plug pocket for the ignition 
plug extending outwardly from.the side wall of the 
combustion chamber, an L-shaped step portion formed along 
a part of the circumference of the combustion chamber, 
the side wall of which contacts or crosses with the 
side wall of the plug pocket and a part of which is 
used as a first fuel guide passage, and a second fuel 
guide passage formed on the upper portion of the side 
wall of the combustion chamber so as to contact with 
the bottom wall of the step portion and leading to the 
plug pocket. In the above engine, fuel injected in the 
area from the second fuel guide passage to the bottom 
wall of the step portion at a low engine load, is 
directed to the plug pocket along the fuel guide 
passages while being evaporating by the heat of the 
piston. At this time, the evaporated fuel is prevented 
from flowing out the upper surface of the piston by the 
side wall of the step portion and is surely led into the 
plug pocket without passing the outside thereof. Thus, 
the above engine is intended to realize a good 
stratified charge combustion at a low engine load, by 
collecting all of injected fuel into the plug pocket as 
evaporated fuel. In the above engine, all of injected fuel 
cannot evaporate until it reaches the plug pocket so  
 
that a part amount of injected fuel flows thereinto as 
liquid fuel. If the engine speed is so low that the time 
from fuel injection to ignition is relative long, all 
of the liquid fuel in the plug pocket can evaporate 
therein during this time and the above good stratified 
charge combustion can be realized. However, when the 
engine speed is high, the ignition plug can be inserted 
into the plug pocket before all of the liquid fuel 
evaporates. In this case, the liquid fuel can stick onto 
the ignition portion of the plug so that misfires occur.  
 Moreover, from the US-A-3 420 216 an internal combustion engine 
is known which comprises a hollow combustion chamber in which a 
fuel guide passage is provided for guiding a fuel rich air 
mixture via the combustion chamber into the vicinity of an 
ignition plug being surrounded by a sleeve so as to fill the 
sleeve with the fuel rich air mixture. This engine, however, 
suffers from a
