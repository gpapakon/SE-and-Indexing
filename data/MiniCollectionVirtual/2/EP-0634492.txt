<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to enzymatic 
processes for the resolution of enantiomeric 
mixtures of compounds useful as intermediates in 
the preparation of taxanes, particularly for the 
preparation of taxanes bearing a C-13 sidechain 
containing a heterocyclic or cycloalkyl group. Taxanes are diterpene compounds which find 
utility in the pharmaceutical field. For example, 
taxol analogues containing heterocyclic or 
cycloalkyl groups on the C-13 sidechain find 
utility as anticancer agents. Such taxol analogues 
may be prepared through semi-synthetic routes, 
particularly by the coupling of β-lactam or open 
chain intermediates to the taxane core to form a 
sidechain at C-13. As the stereochemistry of these 
analogues may affect their pharmaceutical activity, 
methods allowing efficient stereospecific 
preparation of the intermediate β-lactam and open 
chain compounds, as well as the final taxane 
products, are sought in the art.  The present invention provides efficient 
methods for the resolution of enantiomeric 
mixtures, preferably racemic mixtures, of compounds 
useful as intermediates in the preparation of 
taxanes bearing a C-13 sidechain containing a 
heterocyclic or cycloalkyl group, and thus for the 
stereospecific preparation of these compounds. Specifically, the present invention provides 
a method for the resolution of a mixture I 
comprising the enantiomers Ia and Ib, where R¹ is 
in the cis position relative to R² in both Ia and 
Ib, or where R¹ is in the trans position relative 
to R² in both Ia and Ib: 
where 
R¹ ishydroxyl; halo; or -O-C(O)-R⁴, where 
R⁴ is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, 
cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or heterocyclo; R² isheterocyclo or cycloalkyl; and R³ ishydrogen; R⁴; -C(O)-OR⁴; or -C(O)-R⁴, 
where R⁴ is independently selected from 
those groups recited for R⁴ above; comprising the step of contacting said mixture I 
with an enzyme or microorganism capable of 
catalyzing the stereoselective conversion of one of 
said compounds Ia or Ib to a non-enantiomeric form, 
and effecting said conversion.  The present invention also provides a 
process for the resolution of a mixture IV 
comprising the enantiomers IVa and IVb: 
R²-Ta-C(O)-OR⁶   (IVa)   and 
R²-Tb-C(O)-OR⁶   (IVb)where
 
Ta is 
and Tb is 
or 
Ta is 
and
 
Tb is 
where R¹ is in the erythro position relative to the 
group W in both IVa and IVb, or where R¹ is in the 
threo position relative to the group W in both IVa 
and IVb;
 
W is -NHR³ or -N₃ ; 
R¹ ishydroxyl; halo; or -O-C(O)-R⁴, where 
R⁴ is alkyl, alkenyl,
