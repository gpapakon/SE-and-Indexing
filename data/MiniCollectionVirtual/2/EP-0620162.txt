<ABSTRACT>
A container/closure assembly, consisting of a container part (1) having a neck section (2) on which a first catch means (4') is provided on the outer circumference, and having a cap part (11) which can be snapped onto the neck section of the container part with a circumferential wall on which a second catch means (17) is provided on the inner circumference, which second catch means can be brought into engagement with the first catch means, gripping behind the latter, in order to fix the cap part relative to the container part. One of the first or second catch means is designed as a catch ring (4) and the other catch means (17) is designed in the shape of a plurality of catch projections (17) arranged distributed over the circumference. Provided on the catch ring (4, 4') is a number of regions (5, 5') arranged distributed over the circumference and corresponding to the number and position of the catch projections (17), in which the engagement with the catch projections is reduced so that, in an aligned relation of the catch projections to the said regions, the snapped-on cap part (11) can be removed axially from the neck section (2) of the container part (1) by hand. Instead of only one catch ring (4), a further catch ring (4') spaced away from the latter and having engagement-reducing regions (5') arranged offset is preferably provided.
