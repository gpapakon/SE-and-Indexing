<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic actuation system for injection-moulding machines is proposed, having a hydraulic pump 14 and a plurality of hydraulic drives 1 to 6, which can be connected thereto in a selectable number and sequence via a hydraulic line network 13 and valves 7 to 12. For working with good efficiency and low operating costs, it is proposed   - that the hydraulic pump 14 is designed as a constant feed pump having a volumetric delivery (displacement) and/or delivery pressure which corresponds at least to the maximum consumption (absorption) of all the hydraulic drives 1 to 6, - that the hydraulic pump 14 can be driven by an electric motor 15 which can be controlled in its speed infinitely variably (steplessly) - or else at least with many steps - over a predetermined speed range, - that the volumetric delivery (displacement) and/or the delivery pressure can be adapted by the maximum drive speed of the electric motor 15 to the maximum consumption and/or to the maximum consuming pressure of all the hydraulic drives 1 to 6, - and that the speed for the electric motor 15 can be controlled proportionally with respect to the consumption and/or the consuming pressure of the respectively actuated hydraulic drives 1 to 6.

Hydraulic operating system for injection moulding machines with a hydraulic pump
(14), which operates without pressure storage, and a plurality of hydraulic drives (1 to 6),

which are connectible therewith in selectable number and sequence by way of a hydraulic
duct mains and valves (9 to 12), wherein the hydraulic pump (14) is designed as a

continuously or constantly conveying pump with a conveying flow, volume and/or pressure,
which corresponds with at least the maximum consumption amount of all hydraulic drives

(1 to 6), and is drivable by an electric motor (15), which above a preset rotational speed
range can be regulated in its rotational speed steplessly or, however, at least in a plurality

of steps and the maximum drive rotational speed of which matches the conveying flow,
volume and/or pressure to the maximum consumption quantity and/or the maximum

consumption pressure of all hydraulic drives (1 to 6), in that the rotational speed for the
electric motor (15) can be regulated proportionally to the consumption quantity and/or the

consumption pressure of the respective hydraulic drives (1 to 6) set in operation, wherein
the electric motor (15) is controllable in drive by an integrated control (19) comprising a

programmable ramp former acting on the rotational speed per time unit.
Hydraulic operating system according to claim 1, wherein an internally toothed
impeller pump is provided as the continuously or constantly conveying pump (14).
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 and 2, wherein a vector-regulated,
three-phase squirrel cage motor is provided as the electric motor (15).
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 and 2, wherein a
frequency-regulated, three-phase squirrel cage motor is provided as the electric motor

(15).
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 and 2, wherein a three-phase
servomotor is provided as the electric motor (15).
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein an
electrically controllable pressure limiting and relief valve or proportional pressure-limiting

valve (16) is associated with the continuously or constantly conveying pump (14). 
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the pressure
limiting and relief valve or proportional pressure-limiting valve (16) is also controllable by

way of the ramp former.
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
continuously or constantly conveying pump (14) is flange-connected directly with the

electric motor (15) or connected with this by way of a pump carrier.
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 to 8, wherein it comprises
a closing cylinder (4), an installation height adjusting motor (5) and an ejector cylinder (6)

at the tool closing unit as well as the worm drive hydraulic motor (1), an injection cylinder
(2) and at least one nozzle pressing-on cylinder (3a and 3b) of the injection unit, which are

each controllable by an individual path valve (10, 11, 12 or 7, 8, 9).
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the electric
motor (15) is regulable above a rotational speed range between 10 and 2500 rpm,

preferably between 120 and 1800 rpm.
Hydraulic operating system according to one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the
rotational speed regulation of the electric motor (15) is subject to a target and actual value

control (19), which in a given case can in turn be influenced by initiators or sensors and/or
travel transmitters at the hydraulic drives (1 to 6) and/or the path valves (7 to 12) thereof.
