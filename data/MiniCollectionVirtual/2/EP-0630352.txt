<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
preparation of granular borate compositions, to granular
compositions and to fertilizers comprising such compositions.Processes for manufacturing particulate materials,
such as spray drying, often yield products in the form of
small particles. Such products are frequently difficult to
handle and typically are dusty and of low bulk density.Techniques for the granulation of small particles to
provide larger particle sized products are well known. A
comprehensive review of processes for granulation is given,
in Kirk-Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third
Edition (21) pp 77-105.Agglomeration techniques are often included
in the preparation of powder detergent compositions
wherein the individual ingredients have variable particle
sizes and are liable to settle rapidly on storage.
Agglomeration is accomplished by the addition of water
as an agglomerating agent, but the products 
have a tendency to cake on storage in their cartons,
so the use of additives such as anionic surfactants
and anti-caking agents has been proposed, see for
example U.S. Patent 4029608 and EP-A-0060587.Granulation of alkali metal borates has been
previously described. U.S. Patent 4256479 discloses
a process for granulating sodium tetraborate
pentahydrate to produce a pre-determined particle size
range suitable for fertilizer bulk-blending operations
by introducing a stream of small amounts of acid
solutions, such as sulfuric acid and/or phosphoric
acid, onto agitated feedstock.Spray dried sodium octaborate (a sodium
borate composition of the approximate formula
Na2B8O13·4H2O - also known as disodium octaborate
tetrahydrate), manufactured by spray drying an aqueous
solution containing boric acid and borax in the molar
ratio of 4:1, is an amorphous product having particle
sizes less than 0.075 mm and a typical poured bulk
density of 0.32 kg/l. The product is used commercially
as a source of boron, an essential element for plant
growth, for fertilizers, as a timber preservative and
as a flame retardant. In all these applications it is 
essential that the product should dissolve rapidly in
liquid carriers, usually water. Typically, 1 kg of
spray-dried sodium octaborate will dissolve in 20
liters of water at 20° C in 5 to 7 minutes.Microscopic examination of spray-dried
sodium octaborate shows particle shapes displayed as
broken microspheres. The material has a low bulk
density due to the particle shape and packing
characteristics, has poor flow characteristics and
dust may be released

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a granular water
soluble alkali metal borate composition comprising sodium

pentaborate which process comprises:

(a) agitating a finely divided feedstock having
an average particle size of less than 75µm and comprising a

mixture of borax pentahydrate and boric acid, the molar ratio
of alkali metal oxide to boric oxide being from 0.1:1 to

0.5:1, or spray dried sodium octaborate of the formula

O;
(b) optionally heating the agitated feedstock
particles to a temperature of at least 50°C;
(c) contacting the agitated feedstock particles
with an optionally heated aqueous granulating agent under

such conditions that the feedstock reacts with the formation
of sodium pentaborate and in agglomerated form; and
(d) optionally drying and recovering a granular
borate composition having an average particle size of at

least 250µm.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the
amount of aqueous granulating agent is up to 25% by weight,

based on the weight of the feedstock.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the alkali metal is sodium.
A process according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the feedstock consists essentially 

of spray dried sodium octaborate and the resulting granular
borate composition is of the formula

A process according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the granular borate composition is

screened to remove oversized product having a particle size
in excess of 1 mm and/or undersized product having a particle

size of less than 250µm.
A process according to claim 5 wherein
oversized product having a particle size in excess of 500µm

is removed.
A process according to claim 5 or 6, wherein
oversized product is pulverized and screened, particles of

desired particle size are added to the product and undersized
particles either are recycled as feedstock or dissolved in

water to provide an aqueous alkali metal borate solution for
use as granulating agent.
A process according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein a liquid granulating agent is

applied as a fine mist through a nozzle operated
ultrasonically or pneumatically.
A process according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein the granulating agent comprises

liquid water and steam.
