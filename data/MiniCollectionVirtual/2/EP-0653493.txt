<ABSTRACT>
A method of detecting the presence of a T-cell antigen receptor gene which is specific for T-cell clones accumulated in a 
specimen, which method comprises preparing a cDNA from T-cells in a specimen, amplifying a T-cell antigen receptor gene in 

the cDNA by the PCR method, and analyzing the amplified gene by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
detecting expression of T-cell antigen receptor (referred 
to as T cell receptor hereinafter) genes. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a method for 
detecting the presence of a gene specific to T cell clone 
accumulated in a test sample which comprises analyzing a 
β chain of T-cell receptor genes in T cells contained in 
the test sample, by applying a polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) and a single strand conformation polymorphism 
(SSCP) technique. Immune response which is a protective mechanism 
of an organism is roughly classified into humoral 
immunity and cell-mediated or cellular immunity; in 
humoral immunity, a B cell-producing specific antibody is 
reactive with an antigen and in cell-mediated immunity, T 
cells release an active substance or act directly on 
antigen-presenting cells. T cells are responsible for cellular immunity 
and recognize antigens; not only antigens but histocompatibility 
antigens on antigen-presenting cells such 
as macrophages, B cells or dendritic cells are required  
 
for recognition by T cells. T cell receptors present on 
T cells recognize a complex of this histocompatibility 
antigen and a foreign antigen in antigen-presenting 
cells. The T cell receptor is a heterodimer of α and β 
or γ and δ consisting of two pairs of disulfide-linked 
polypeptide chains and is expressed on cell membrane as a 
complex with T3 (CD₃) antigen. Each chain of α, β, γ and 
δ contain the variable region (V domain) which differs in 
response to the antigenic specificity of each T cell and 
the constant region (C domain) which has the same 
sequence. The α and γ chains further have J (joining) 
segment between the V and C domains and the β and δ 
chains further have D (diversity) and J (joining) 
segments between the V and C domains. Little is hitherto known about the relationship 
between pathogenic antigens of an autoimmune disease such 
as chronic rheumatoid arthritis and antigen-specific T 
cells. However, there are reports implying that an 
accumulation of some clonal T cells or of T cells 
expressing certain V genes of T cell receptors 
(Stamenkovic, I. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85: 
1179-1183 (1988); Hakoda, M. et al., Clin. Immunol. 
Immunopathol., 57: 387-398 (1990)). On the other hand, 
it is also reported that no significant clonal expansion 
of specific T cells have been noted in patient with 
chronic rheumatoid arthritis but polyclonal T cell 
activation would dominate (Keystone, E. C. et al.,

A method for detecting the presence of T cell 
receptor genes which comprises: 

   preparing a cDNA mixture comprising T cell-derived 
cDNA from a test sample containing T cells; 

   subjecting the cDNA mixture to a polymerase 
chain reaction using as a primer a DNA fragment encoding 

the β chain of T-cell receptors to amplify the genes 
encoding the β chain of the T-cell receptors in the cDNA 

mixture; and then, 
   subjecting the thus amplified genes to analysis 

by a single strand conformation polymorphism technique to 
detect the presence of the T cell clone-specific genes 

accumulated in the test sample which encodes the β chain 
of the T-cell receptors. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said 
test sample is obtained from fluid or tissue of a patient 

suspected of abnormal immune response, a patient with 
viral disease, a patient with cancer or a patient with 

hepatitis. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein a DNA 
fragment encoding the V region of β chain and a DNA 

fragment encoding the C region of β chain, in T-cell 
receptors are employed as said primer for PCR. 
A method according to claim 3, wherein said DNA 
fragment encoding the V region of β chain in T-cell 

receptors used as the primer for PCR is a DNA fragment 
encoding the region selected from a subtype set of Vβ₁ to 

 
Vβ₂₀. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein analysis by the SSCP technique is performed on 

glycerol-added acrylamide having a low crosslinking 
degree. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the presence of a T cell clone having a specific 

sequence in the DNA sequence encoding the D region and/or 
J region of β chain in the T-cell receptors and genes 

thereof are detected as genes specific to T cell clones 
accumulated in said test sample. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein analysis by the SSCP technique is performed by 

means of hybridization using as a probe a DNA fragment 
encoding the J region of β chain of the T cell receptors.
