<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel tertbutylergoline
derivatives, to a process for their
production, to a pharmaceutical composition containing them
and to their use as pharmaceuticals.Ergolyl-and dihydroergolylanilides are described in EP-A-82 805, and are endowed
with hypertensive and antiserotonergic activities.The present invention provides a novel group or
ergoline derivatives, which have been found to possess
special interesting biological activity.The disclosed compounds have selective and high
affinity for 5-HT1A receptors and differ notably from most
other ergoline derivatives in that they display a
negligible affinity for α1, α2, D1, D2 receptors.The said compounds can be used for the treatment of
various disorders associated with serotoninergic
disfunctions, such as impairment of thermoregulation,
memory function, sleep disorders, satiety control (i.e.
consumption of food and of beverages.), drugs addiction,
control of drug withdrawal, hypertension, hyperemesis,
depression, anxiety and psychosis, ischemic insult.More particularly the present invention provides a
compound of formula (I)

2, m is 1 or 2; R4 is hydrogen, C1-7 alkyl, C3-7 cycloalkyl,
adamantidyl (tricyclo 3.3.1.1.3,7) decan-1-yl), C1-5
alkylphenyl, vinylphenyl, ethynylphenyl, phenyl
optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from
C1-4 alkyl, C1-3 alkoxy, methylendioxy, cyano,
trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, nitro and acetyl; an optionally

acceptable salt thereof.A halogen is preferably chlorine or bromine. The t-butyl
substituent is at position 13 or 14 of the ergoline
framework. The substituent at position 8 is a or β. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition
