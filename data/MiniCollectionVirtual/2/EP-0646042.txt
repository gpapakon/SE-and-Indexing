<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing adipic acid by
subjecting an aqueous solution of an alkali metal salt

of adipic acid to electrolysis in a three-part membrane
electrolysis cell consisting essentially of an anode, a

cathode, an anolyte compartment, a catolyte compartment,
a center compartment and two cation exchange

membranes, characterized in that the electrolysis is
carried out with the addition of a mineral acid or a

salt to the center compartment to obtain a solution of
essentially adipic acid and a solution of essentially

an alkali metal hydroxide.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the mineral acid or salt used is sulfuric acid,

nitric acid, sodium sulfate or sodium nitrate.
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 2, characterized
in that the electrolysis is carried out at a

temperature within the range from 50 to 110°C.
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized

in that the streams of materials are guided
countercurrently.
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that adipic acid is recovered from the

essentially adipic acid solution by crystallization.
A process as claimed in claim 5, characterized
in that the crystallization is carried out at a

temperature within the range from 0 to 50°C and at
pressures within the range from 1 to 100 kPa. 
A process as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized
in that the crystallization is carried out at a

temperature within the range from 15 to 40°C and at
pressures within the range from 4 to 20 kPa.
The use of the process of claims 5 to 7 for
preparing high purity adipic acid.
