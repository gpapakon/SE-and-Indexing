<ABSTRACT>
A polyalkylene glycol is added to a reaction mixture obtained by a condensation reaction of fluorenone with phenol in the presence of ss-mercaptopropionic acid and HCl gas, excess phenol is then distilled off, and the residue is crystallised out from a solvent which is miscible with the polyalkylene glycol used. After recrystallisation and treatment with water, 9,9-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene is obtained in the form of a white crystalline product in a purity of above 99%.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene 
by means of a condensation reaction between 

fluorenone and phenol in molar ratios of 1:4 to 1:8 carried 
out at 30°C to 90°C and catalysed by β-mercaptopropionic 

acid and HCl gas, characterised in that the reaction mixture 
is mixed with a polyalkylene glycol when the reaction is 

complete, excess phenol is distilled off, the distillation residue 
is mixed with a solvent miscible with polyalkylene glycol, the 

product crystallising as a result is separated, suspended in 
water and heated, 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene being 

obtained in the form of white crystals. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
polyethylene glycol of the general formula H(-O-CH₂-CH₂-)
n
OH 
with n = 2 to 13 is stirred into the reaction mixture as a 

polyalkylene glycol. 
A process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that 
triethylene glycol is stirred into the reaction mixture as a 

polyalkylene glycol. 
A process according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the polyalkylene glycol is added in a quantity of 15 to 20 

vol.% in relation to the reaction mixture. 
A process for the preparation of 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene 
by means of a condensation reaction between 

fluorenone and phenol in molar ratios of 1:4 to 1:8 carried 
out at 30°C to 90°C and catalysed by β-mercaptopropionic 

acid and HCl gas, characterised in that the reaction mixture 
is mixed with a polyalkylene glycol when the reaction is  

 
complete, excess phenol is distilled off, the distillation residue 

is mixed with an acetonitrile, the adduct crystallising as a 
result is filtered off and 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene is 

obtained by drying in a vacuum.
