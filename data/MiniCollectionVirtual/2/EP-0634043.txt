<ABSTRACT>
A method of transmitting (600) and receiving coded speech, in which method samples are taken (602) of a speech signal (601) and reflection coefficients are calculated (603) from these samples. In order to minimize the used transmission rate, characteristics of the reflection coefficients are compared (606) with respective stored (624) sound-specific characteristics of the reflection coefficients for the identification of the sounds, and identifiers of identified sounds are transmitted (617), speaker-specific characteristics are calculated (607) for the reflection coefficients representing the same sound and stored in a memory (608, 609, 610), the calculated characteristics of the reflection coefficients representing said sound and stored in the memory (610) are compared (611) with the following characteristics of the reflection coefficients representing the same sound, and if the following characteristics of the reflection coefficients representing the same sound do not essentially differ from the characteristics of the reflection coefficients stored in the memory (610), differences between the characteristics of the reflection coefficients representing the same sound of the speaker and the characteristics of the reflection coefficients calculated from the previous sample are calculated (616) and transmitted (625).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of transmitting
coded speech, in which method samples are taken
of a speech signal and reflection coefficients are
calculated from these samples.The invention relates also to a method of receiving
coded speech.In telecommunication systems, especially on the
radio path of radio telephone systems, such as GSM
system, it is known that a speech signal entering the
system and to be transmitted is preprocessed, i.e.
filtered and converted into digital form. In known
systems the signal is then coded by a suitable coding
method, e.g. by the LTP (Long Term Prediction) or RPE
(Regular Pulse Excitation) method. The GSM system
typically uses a combination of these, i.e. the RPE-LTP
method, which is described in detail e.g. in "M.
Mouly and M.B. Paute, The GSM System for Mobile Communications,
1992, 49, rue PALAISEAU F-91120, pages
155 to 162". These methods are described in more detail
in the GSM Specification "GSM 06.10, January
1990, GSM Full Rate Speech Transcoding, ETSI, 93
pages".A drawback of the known techniques is the fact
that the coding methods used require plenty of transmission
capacity. When using these methods according
to the prior art, the speech signal to be transmitted
to the receiver has to be transmitted entirely,
whereby transmission capacity is unnecessarily
wasted.Patent specification US-A-5 121 434 discloses analysing and
synthesizing speech using vocal tract simulation. The object of this invention is to offer such a
speech coding method for transmitting data in telecommunication
systems by which the transmission speed
required for speech transmission may be lowered and/
or the required transmission capacity may be reduced.This novel method of transmitting coded speech
is provided by means of the method of the invention as defined in claim 1. The invention relates further to a method of
receiving coded speech as defined in claim 2.The invention is based on the idea that, for a
transmission, a speech signal is analyzed by means of
the LPC (Linear Prediction Coding) method, and a set
of parameters, typically characteristics of reflection
coefficients, modelling a speaker's vocal tract
is created for the speech signal to be transmitted.
According to the invention, sounds are then identified
from the speech to be transmitted by comparing
the reflection coefficients of the speech to be
transmitted with several speakers' respective previously
received reflection coefficients calculated for
the same sound. After this, reflection coefficients
and some

<CLAIMS>
A method of transmitting (600) coded speech,
according to which samples are taken (10; 602) of a

speech signal (IN; 601) and reflection coefficients are
calculated (603) from these samples, the method being

characterized in that

characteristics of the reflection coefficients are
compared (17; 606) with respective stored (624; 54)

sound-specific characteristics of the reflection
coefficients of at least one known speaker for the

identification of the sounds, and identifiers of the
identified sound are transmitted (617),
speaker-specific characteristics are calculated
(18; 607) for the reflection coefficients representing

the same sound and stored in a memory (19; 608, 609,
610),
the calculated characteristics of the reflection
coefficients representing said sound and stored in the

memory (610) are compared (20; 611) with the
characteristics of subsequent reflection coefficients

representing the same sound, and if said characteristics
of the subsequent reflection coefficients representing

the same sound differ (21) essentially from the
characteristics of the reflection coefficients stored in

the memory (610), the new characteristics representing
the same sound are stored (609) in the memory (610) and

transmitted (613), and, before transmitting them, an
information (612) is sent indicating the transmission of

these characteristics,
otherwise if said characteristics of the subsequent
reflection coefficients representing the same sound do

not essentially differ (20) from the characteristics of
the reflection coefficients stored in the memory (610),

differences between said characteristics of the
subsequent reflection coefficients representing the same

sound of the speaker and the characteristics of the 
reflection coefficients stored in said mempry (610) are

calculated and transmitted (22, 23; 616, 625).
A method of receiving (700) coded speech, which
method is characterized in that


an identifier identifying a sound of a known

speaker is received (706; 500), and
if differences (708) between characteristics of the
stored speaker-specific reflection coefficients of the

sound and characteristics of the reflection coefficients
calculated from speech samples in a transmitter are

received, then
the speaker-specific characteristics of the
reflection coefficients corresponding to the received

sound identifier are searched for (718, 716) in a memory
(711; 501) and added (712; 503) to said received

differences (708), and from this sum are calculated new
reflection coefficients (713) used for sound (720)

reproduction, and
otherwise if an information (709) indicating the
transmission of new characteristics sent by a

communications transmitter (600) as well as new
characteristics (710) of the reflection coefficients

representing the same sound sent by the communications
transmitter are received, these new characteristics are

stored in the memory (711; 501).
A method according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that said characteristics are averages
of the reflection coefficients.
