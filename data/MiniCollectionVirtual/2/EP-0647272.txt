<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention in the fields of virology
and oncology relates to GAP 31, an anti-HIV protein
purified from Gelonium plant extracts, and DAP 30 and DAP
32 anti-HIV proteins purified from Dianthus extracts, DNA
encoding these proteins, antibodies specific for these
proteins, and uses of these proteins in treating HIV
infection.Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the
etiological agent for AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome), is a member of the lentiviruses, a subfamily of
retroviruses. Many retroviruses are well-known
carcinogens. HIV perse is not known to cause cancer in
humans or other animals, but it does present a formidable
challenge to the host. HIV integrates its genetic
information into the genome of the host. The viral genome
contains many regulatory elements which allow the virus to
control its rate of replication in both resting and
dividing cells. Most importantly, HIV infects and invades
cells of the immune system; it destroys the body's immune
system and renders the patient susceptible to
opportunistic infections and neoplasms. The immune defect
appears to be progressive and irreversible, with a high
mortality rate that approaches 100% over several years.HIV is transmitted by parenteral inoculation
and/or intimate sexual contact. It is estimated that
about 2 million people in the United States are currently
infected with HIV, and 5 to 10 million people are infected
worldwide. Recent projections indicate that a majority of
those now infected will develop AIDS within a seven year 
follow-up period. In 1989 alone, over 130,000 cases of
AIDS were reported domestically, and more than half of
these patients have died. An additional 100,000 cases
were diagnosed in the United States by the end of 1990.
Reports to the World Health Organization suggested that at
least a million new cases of AIDS can be expected within
the next five years worldwide. It is apparent that AIDS
is an unprecedented threat to global health. The search
for effective therapies to treat AIDS is of paramount
importance.HIV-1 is trophic and cytopathic for T4
lymphocytes, cells of the immune system which express the
cell surface differentiation antigen CD4 (also known as
OKT4, T4 and leu3). The viral tropism is due to the
interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein,
gp120, and the cell-surface CD4 molecules (Dalgleish,
A.G. et al., Nature312: 763-767 (1984). These
interactions not only mediate the infection of susceptible
cells by HIV but are also responsible for the virus-induced
fusion of infected and

Gelonium multiflorum (Euphorbiaceae himalaya);
(b) has anti-HIV activity in vitro at
concentrations of about 0.3 nanomolar;
(c) lacks non-specific cytotoxicity in vitro at
concentrations of about 300 nanomolar; and
(d) comprises the amino acid sequences of SEQ
NO:1.
A process for purifying a protein according to
claim 1, comprising:


(a) extracting said seeds with 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 M NaCl;
(b) centrifuging said extract at least once,
recovering the supernatant and fractionating said

supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation; and
