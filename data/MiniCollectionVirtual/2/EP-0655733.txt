<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a magnetic recording
medium and a magnetic recording medium produced thereby.
Particularly it concerns a magnetic recording medium in which a
ferromagnetic metal layer serves as a magnetic layer, said
ferromagnetic metal layer having corrosion resistance,
durability, abrasion resistance and lubricity.Magnetic recording media in which ferromagnetic metal
layers serve as magnetic layers have excellent
characteristics such as high saturation magnetic flux
density and coercive force.Previously, various magnetic recording media and
methods for producing the same have been proposed to
improve the corrosion resistance, durability, abrasion
resistance and lubricity of the magnetic recording media in
which the ferromagnetic metal layers serve as the magnetic
layers.For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication
No. 4-341918 discloses a magnetic recording medium in which
a ferromagnetic metal thin film serves as a magnetic layer,
the magnetic recording medium comprising an undercoat
layer, a ferromagnetic metal film and a topcoat layer on a
non-magnetic resin substrate, the undercoat layer and the
topcoat layer each containing C and H, and being plasma-polymerized 
films having a refractive index of 1.8 or more,
and Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 5-20663
discloses a magnetic recording medium in which the
undercoat layer is a plasma-polymerized film containing Si
or Si and O, and the topcoat layer is a plasma-polymerized
film containing C and H. Japanese Patent Examined
Publication No. 5-33456 discloses a magnetic recording
medium comprising a substrate, a magnetic layer formed on
the substrate and a protective layer formed on the magnetic
layer, the protective layer comprising a hard carbon layer
and a fluorine-containing lubricating oil layer, and
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 57-135443
discloses a magnetic recording medium in which a vapor
stream of a magnetic substance is obliquely incident on a
surface of a substrate to deposit a magnetic thin film, and
immediately thereafter, an organic substance is plasma
polymerized on the deposited magnetic film to provide an
overcoat thin-film layer. Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. 57-164432 discloses a magnetic recording
medium in which an organic polymer layer is formed on an
oblique deposition type metal magnetic layer, and a higher
fatty acid or ester layer is formed thereon, the organic
polymer layer and the higher fatty acid or ester layer
being formed by vacuum
