<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention resides in a process for the preparation of a high purity
cobalt intermediate substantially free of both cationic and anionic impurities. The
process allows for a cobalt intermediate to be recovered in high yield and purity from an
ammoniacal ammonium carbonate solution of the cobalt tetrammine complex.In prior art processes nickel and cobalt bearing ores and concentrates may for
example be processed by the reduction roast ammonium carbonate oxidative leach
route. By this route, impure cobalt sulphide is produced as a by-product, and the
isolation and recovery of this by-product is illustrated in Australian Patent AU-B- 605867.The recovery of cobalt as a sulphide is achieved by injection of a suitable
sulphiding agent, for example, gaseous hydrogen sulphide or ammonium hydrosulphide
solution. This procedure however results in the precipitation of sulphides of other
elements present such as iron, zinc, copper and nickel as well as the adsorption and or
coprecipitation of compounds that normally do not produce insoluble sulphides, such as
calcium, magnesium and manganese.In order to produce pure cobalt metal or a pure cobalt compound for industrial
applications it is necessary to first solubilize the impure sulphides and then isolate the
cobalt in a suitable form free of unwanted impurities.A number of processes have been reported describing the isolation of cobalt as
a pure product. These procedures usually involve a combination of solubilization,
precipitation, solvent extraction and electrowinning operations. One such process,
known as the Nippon Mining Corporation process, recovers cobalt in the metallic form
by electrowinning from an acidic sulphate solution. Another process, known as the
Sumitomo process, also recovers cobalt in metallic form however this is electrowon
from a chloride solution. Both of these operations have common features in that the
cobalt is present in the cobaltous state at the point of isolation and the product is a
massive metal cathode plate.Another commercial cobalt sulphide refining process is the soluble cobaltic
ammine process developed by Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. This process involves
solubilization, precipitation of hydrated ferric oxide, conversion of the cobaltous
sulphate to cobaltic pentammine sulphate, precipitation of nickel ammoniurn sulphate,
reduction of the cobaltic pentammine to cobaltous diammino and, finally, pressure
hydrogen reduction to cobalt metal powder. Cobalt has many applications and not all of these require cobalt metal.
