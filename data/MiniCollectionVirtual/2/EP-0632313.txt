<ABSTRACT>
The Mach-Zehnder type all-optical device (2) is characterized 
by each of two arms (28, 30) being composed at least partially of 

material having third order optical nonlinearity, and means (20, 14; 40, 
42) for introducing a control light to a portion (16, 44) of each of the 

arms (28, 30) revealing optical nonlinearity. By the invention, it is 
possible to achieve low power operation and ultrahigh-speed switching 

without the switching speed being restricted by the relaxation time of 
the nonlinear material

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an all-optical device for directly
controlling a light with a light, and more particularly to a
ultrahigh-speed all-optical device used as an optical control device in
the fields of particularly the optical fiber communication and optical
data processing.The article "An Ultrafast All-Optical Gate" in IEEE Journal
of Quantum Electronics, vol. QE-19, no. 11, Nov. 1983, New
York US, discloses an optical waveguide gate based on a
nonlinear optical interaction in a waveguide interferometer.
The relative phase shift is provided via optical control
pulses in one or two arms of the interferometer which
changes the index via the nonlinear index of the waveguide
medium. The nonlinearity corresponds to an element of the
third-order.Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 13, No. 502 (P-958) of
November 13, 1989 and JP-A-01 201 627 disclose a waveguide
type optical switch for a two-beam interferometer. When a
control light is radiated to a part of the waveguide, a
propagation constant of the waveguide is varied by a nonlinear
optical effect.It is absolutely necessary to drive a device for accomplishing
optical control at higher speed in order to operate the optical fiber
communication and optical data processing system at higher speed. In
a conventional optical control device, the optical control has been
carried out with electrical signals. However, in these days, attention
is attracted to a process in which a light is directly controlled with a
light, in order to carry out higher speed operation. This process has
many advantages including that the operation speed thereof is not
restricted by a CR time constant of an electrical circuit, and that
optical pulses by which it is possible to generate pulses quite shorter
than electrical pulses are directly available. However, many unsolved
problems have to be solved in order to establish such an all-optical
device. In particular, many requirements have to be satisfied
simultaneously for establishing such an all-optical device. The many
requirements include functions of the device, low power operation,
high transmittance of a signal light, and high repetition operation
speed. It is preferred for the functions of the device to include that a
route of a signal light can be switched by a control light, and also that
such devices can be cascaded. Devices which satisfy these
requirements include a Mach-Zehnder type waveguide device and a
directional coupler type waveguide device. Among these two devices, a
Mach-Zehnder type waveguide device is considered to
