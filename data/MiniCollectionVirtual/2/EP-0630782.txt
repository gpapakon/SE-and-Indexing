<ABSTRACT>
A luggage rack (14) of the type suitable for 
installation on the roof (12) of an automotive vehicle (10) 

is improved through the addition of a mechanism for reducing 
the noise generated by wind passing over cross members 

(16,18) of the luggage rack (14). The mechanism is a strip 
(34) having irregular outer surfaces (40,42) secured to 

outer surfaces of at least one of the cross members (16,18). 
The irregular surfaces (40,42) operate to vary the cross 

section of the cross member (16,18) as it extends 
transversely of the vehicle (10), and the strip (34) may be 

formed as a tape having an adhesive layer (36) for 
securement to the luggage rack (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to automobile
luggage racks and more specifically to structure reducing
wind noise propagated by movement of vehicles carrying such
luggage racks.While the mounting of luggage racks on the roofs or
deck lids of automotive vehicles has been found to be useful
in expanding the load carrying capability of the vehicle,
such devices particularly those mounted on roofs have the
adverse effect of presenting a surface set off from the
originally designed surface of the vehicle which is not
consistent with the desired air dynamic approach of the
vehicle design. The luggage racks generally include one or
more transversely extending cross members which tend to
disturb the flow of air over the roof of the vehicle and
create perceptible noises within the vehicle, such as high
pitch whistles or buzzes. This is particularly pronounced
when the frequency of the wind load imposed on the cross
member matches the natural frequency of the cross member.Responsive to this condition, automotive designers have
attempted to modify the structure of the luggage racks by
modifying the configuration of the cross member to reduce
the noise effect. German Patent 2614365 discloses a design
in which a mesh sleeve is put in surrounding relationship
with respect to circular and rectangular cross section cross
members. This approach has been found to not be
aesthetically pleasing and requires a significant outlay in
material and labour to fabricate and install the sleeve.Another approach taken to enhance noise reduction in
roof mounted luggage racks is shown in U.S. Patent
No. 4175682 to Bott. Bott teaches the use of an angularly
adjustable tear drop cross section for the cross member to
optimise the angle by which the cross member is presented to
the air stream to minimise the noise effect.
Disadvantageously this approach requires a significant
complication in the design of the supports for the cross
members and adds both direct assembly labour and 
developmental labour in performing and setting the desired
adjustment.The Patent document DE-A-4 035 729 describes a roof mounted
luggage rack having cross members supported on the roof by
stanchions at each end of the crossmembers. The cross
members are formed to incorporate a regular series of slots
or apertures to control the flow of air past the cross
members.The present invention provides a luggage rack with at least
one transversely extending cross member that includes
structure for defining the cross sectional shape of the
cross member in a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A luggage rack for an automobile body comprising:

at least one transversely extending cross member (16,18),
and
stanchion means (24,26) for supporting opposed ends of
each cross member to position the cross member (16,18) in

generally parallel, spaced relationship with respect to the
automobile body,

   characterised in that means (34) are provided defining a
cross-sectional shape of the cross member that varies

irregularly along the transverse extent of the cross member.
A luggage rack as claimed in claim 1, wherein the shape-defining
means (34) is also operative to define an external

surface (40,42) of the cross member (16,18) that is

irregularly curved in the direction normal to the transverse
extension of the cross member (16,18).
A luggage rack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
shape-defining means (34) comprises an irregularly shaped

elongated strip adhesively secured to the cross member
(16,18).
A luggage rack as claimed in claim 3, wherein the strip
(34) is fabricated as a tape.
A luggage rack as claimed in claim 3, wherein the cross-member
(16,18) is generally tear drop shaped in cross

section.
A luggage rack as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, further comprising a second transversely extending

cross member (16,18) longitudinally spaced from the at least
one transversely extending cross member.
A luggage rack as claimed in claim 6, wherein the tape 
(34) is applied to the surface of each of the cross members

(16,18).
