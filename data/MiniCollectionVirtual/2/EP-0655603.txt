<ABSTRACT>
It comprises a propulsion unit and a projectile comprising a cylindrical body (6) pierced with a central channel (8), at the end of which an explosive charge (7) is located, this body being equipped with receptacles (9, 9'), in which come to bear balls (10, 10') connected to the body (6) by means of flexible ties (12, 12'). The propulsion unit consists of a case (3) containing powder (3) and a primer (2).

A device for capturing, designed for use with a conventional firearm, 
including a propellant and a projectile comprising masses (47', 

47") connected together by a flexible link (50), characterized in that 
the number of masses is two, in that each mass has a head (47', 47") 

and a semi-cylindrical tail (48', 48") of which the outer surface is 
displaced inwards with respect to the outer surface of the corresponding 

head (47', 47") associated thereto, so that when the two masses 
are placed side by side, their two tails (48', 48") form a cylindrical 

body designed for introduction inside the canon (49) of a firearm; in 
that when the two masses (47', 47") are side by side, their heads form 

a body; in that the propellant is provided as a blank cartridge for 
the firearm; and in that upon firing the propellant, a thrust is transmitted 

to said masses (47', 47") forming the body via their tails (48', 
48"), so that the same diverge when they leave the firearm. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that each mass 
(47', 47") forms a semi-projectile, the latter being provided with fins 

(52', 52"). 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that cavities (58', 
58") are provided in the head (47', 47") of each one of the semi-projectiles 

and in that these cavities (58', 58") communicate via a channel 
with the inside of the barrel of the firearm.
