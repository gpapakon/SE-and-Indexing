<ABSTRACT>
A controlled agitation cleaning system, for cleaning parts (11) 
with a flammable cleaning liquid, has a container with an interior 

volume sufficient to accept a quantity of the cleaning liquid and an 

opening through which an item to be cleaned can be placed in the 
cleaning liquid. A lid (18) closes the container opening. Several 

agitation 
nozzles (24) extending in liquid-tight manner through a wall of the 

container, with each nozzle arranged to direct the volume of 
cleaning liquid flowing through that nozzle toward an associated 

container volume portion, when an air-operated pump moves the 
cleaning liquid through the nozzles. The pump is activated only 

when the lid has provided a positive closure of the container 
opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for cleaning
electronic parts and, more particularly, to a novel system for
electronic part cleaning utilizing controlled agitation of an alcohol-based
cleaning solution.Modern electronic technology requires that almost all
electronic components be soldered to the wiring provided for
component interconnection. The soldering processes actually
utilized leave residue which must be removed from the electronic
components, wiring, printed circuit boards, modules, and the like.
Almost all of the present methods for cleaning electronic
components and modules involve the use of various solvents which
have generally been found to be harmful, in some degree, to the
environment. It is therefore highly desirable to provide some
method for cleaning such soldered electronic items with solvent
materials that do not have a harmful atmospheric effect. One
alternative cleaning solution which is known to provide the proper
cleaning action, comprises alcoholic liquids, of either a single
component or a blend of alcohol components; alcoholic cleaning
components have a flammability risk due to the low flash point of
the alcohols involved. Flammability risk rises if the alcoholic
cleaning solutions are used in the conventional spray cleaning
manner. While it is highly desirable to provide a single alcohol or 
alcohol-blend fluid in adequate volume to clean electronic components and
modules, it is even more highly desirable to do so in such manner as to meet
safety requirements which will eliminate the flammability hazard. Therefore,
an alcohol-liquid-based cleaning system which is free of electrical power and
electrical-driven parts, to totally eliminate spark/arc hazards (as well as electrical
shock hazards to a user) is extremely desirable. Even more desirable is a
cleaning system which can also be provided in such manner as to essentially
eliminate the risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage to sensitive electronic
components to be cleaned therein.GB-A-1168035 discloses a cleaning system having a container with a lid,
a plurality of nozzles within the container for directing cleaning fluid at articles
to be cleaned, and a pump for supplying the fluid to the nozzles when the lid is
closed. JP-A-1106493 discloses a device for washing printed circuit boards in
which nozzles in the wall of a container direct jets of washing liquid onto circuit
boards within the container.In accordance with the invention, there is provided a controlled agitation
cleaning system, for cleaning parts
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A controlled agitation cleaning system (10),
comprising:


a container (16) having an interior volume in which a cleaning liquid (14)
is contained, and an opening (16a) through which an item to be cleaned can be

placed in the cleaning liquid and immersed below the surface (14a) thereof; and
lid means (18) for closing the container opening; characterized by a
plurality of agitation nozzles (24) extending in liquid-tight manner through a

wall (16c) of said container and each immersed in the liquid, below the surface
thereof, and arranged to direct any cleaning liquid flowing through that nozzle

to enter and agitate an associated portion of said liquid below said surface;
pump means (34) for moving said cleaning fluid through said nozzles
only when said lid means has closed said container opening; and
exit nozzle means (38) for facilitating withdrawal of cleaning fluid from
said container to said pump means, said exit nozzle means including at least one

exit nozzle located at least as high in the container as an uppermost one of said
agitation nozzles (24).
The cleaning system of claim 1, wherein said pump means (34) is
operated by pressurized air.
The cleaning system of claim 2, further comprising valve means (42) for
controllably connecting a remote source of pressurized air to said pump means.
The cleaning system of claim 3, further comprising means
(42a, 52, 52a, 52b) for controlling said valve means to cause the flow of

pressurized air to said pump means only when said lid means has closed said 
container opening.
The cleaning system of claim 4, wherein said controlling means includes
a member (52) having a first portion (52a) attached to said valve means (42) and

a second portion (52b) located to force said lid to close said container opening
before said first portion can open said valve means for flow of pressurized air

to said pump means.
The cleaning system of claim 2, further comprising means (101) utilizing
pressurized air exhausted from said pump means for removing at least some of

said cleaning fluid from the cleaned item.
The cleaning system of claim 1, further comprising means (60) for
draining the cleaning liquid from said container.
The cleaning system of claim 1, further comprising a casement (68a, 68b)
having a surface supporting said lid means and substantially enclosing said pump

means, said container and said nozzles.
The cleaning system of claim 8, wherein said casement is a liquid-tight
box having a wall completely enclosing said cleaning system and through which

wall pass said lid means and hose means (48) for providing externally-pressurized
air to said pump means.
The cleaning system of claim 9, further comprising means (60, 62, 64) for
draining liquid from said container to beyond an exterior surface of said box

wall. 
The cleaning system of claim 1, wherein a separate plenum (32) is
provided to distribute the pressurized cleaning liquid from said pump means.
The cleaning system of claim 11, wherein each of said nozzles (24) is
separately connected to said plenum.
The cleaning system of claim 1, wherein the cleaning liquid is flammable,
and means (42a, 52, 52a, 52b) are provided for urging at least a portion of said lid

means to normally close a liquid-containing volume of the container.
The cleaning system of claim 13, wherein the cleaning liquid comprises
at least one alcohol.
The cleaning system of claim 13, wherein the container and the lid means
portion are formed of an electrically conductive material.
The cleaning system of claim 15, further comprising electrically non-conductive
hose means (30) connected to said nozzles for facilitating cleaning
