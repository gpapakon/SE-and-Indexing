<ABSTRACT>
To provide a remedy or ameliorant, based on the 

effect of inducing cell differentiation, for diseases 
such as hematopoietic organ tumors and solid tumors 

for which no clinically highly useful drug has been 
known hitherto. The fundamental idea of the 

conventional pharmacotherapy for cancer resides in 
completely exterminating tumor cells having an 

unusually high capability of multiplication. However 
these treatments also had toxicities against normal 

cells and thus grave side effects were unavoidable. 
Further, only limited therapeutic effects could be 

achieved. On the other hand, although all-transretinoic 
acid had a remarkable effect on acute 

promyelocytic leukemia, there was reported that this 
compound also had grave side effects. Further, there 

was another problem that the diseases tended to recur 
after it was healed. In contrast, (2E,4E,6E,10E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2,4,6,10,14-hexadecapentaenoic 

acid has an unexpected effect of inducing cell 
differentiation and a high safety. Being different in 

structure from all-trans-retinoic acid, this compound 
has a high possibility of preventing the recurrence of 

the disease. Therefore, it is expected as a  
 

clinically useful remedy or ameliorant for 
hematopoietic organ tumors, in particular, acute 

promyelocytic leukemia and myeloid dysplasia syndrome.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of (2E, 4E, 6E, 
10E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2,4,6,10,14-hexadecapentaenoic 
acid or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof in the 
preparation of a remedy or ameliorant for hematopoietic 
organ tumors on the basis of the effect of inducing cell 
differentiation (hereinafter referred to as inducing 
differentiation). Cancers (tumors) are classified in various ways 
depending on, for example, manifestation sites, 
pathological images and conditions. Leukemia, which 
is a representative disease of hematopoietic organ 
tumors and means tumors in blood cells (leukocytes), 
is marked by the multiplication of various 
undifferentiated blast leukocytes. Further, leukemia 
is subdivided into acute leukemia and chronic leukemia 
wherein the tumor cells being under multiplication are 
immature blasts and matured cells, respectively. Thus 
there are observed various clinical symptoms of 
leukemia, though most of them can be roughly 
classified into symptoms due to the suppression of  
 
normal hemopoiesis and those due to the infiltration 
and/or compression of other organs. More 
particularly, a fall in normal blood cells is 
expressed in anemia caused by erythropenia, infectious 
diseases and flush caused by granulopenia and a 
tendency toward hemorrhage caused by thrombocytopenia, 
while the suppression of normal hemopoiesis induces 
bone marrow insufficiency. It is well known in 
general that leukemia is a disease with anxious 
prognosis. Thus there have been examined various 
drugs and therapeutic methods therefor. Among acute leukemias acute promyelocytic 
leukemia (hereinafter referred to simply as APL) is a 
disease where the differentiation of tumor cells stops 
in the step of promyelocytes and a number of coarse 
granules and promyelocytes haying a highly atypical 
nucleus undergo multiplication. In the hematological 
FAB classification, APL falls within the category of 
type M3 and is characterized by being accompanied by 
chromosomal aberration t (15 : 17). From a clinical 
viewpoint, disseminated intravascular coagulation 
syndrome (DIC) caused by tissue thromboplastin 
originating in coarse granules frequently takes place 
in the case of APL. Furthermore, APL is accompanied 
by intense fibrinolysis sthenia due to fibrinolytic  
 
activators such as plasminogen activator and elastase 
liberated from leukemic cells and severe hemorrhage is 
thus induced. Namely, APL is the severest or gravest 
disease among acute leukemias. On the other hand, there is another type
