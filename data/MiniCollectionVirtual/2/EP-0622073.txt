<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hard capsules with improved 
swallowability. Hard capsules, a widely used dosage form of solid preparations, can 
adhere to the throat and esophagus upon intake and disintegrate there, 
causing premature release of ingredient chemicals and hence ulceration 
[Clin. Pharmac., 18, 250 (1984); Clin. Pharmacol. Ther., Jan., 72 (1985); 
British Medical Journal, 1, 1673 (1979)]. No attempts have been made to 
solve this problem. The present inventors investigated the solution to this problem, and 
found that hard capsule adhesion to the throat and esophagus upon intake is 
due to the high water solubility and hence high adhesion of gelatin, the major 
component of the capsules, and that the solution is to improve capsule 
swallowability through throat and esophagus by coating the hard capsule 
surface with a water repellent to such extent that the capsule's rapid 
disintegratability is not affected. Accordingly, the present invention relates to hard capsules having a 
surface coating of a physiologically acceptable water repellent. In the present invention, the physiologically acceptable water repellent 
is defined as having water solubility not higher than 0.03 g/l at 25°C. Such 
water repellents include aliphatic saturated hydrocarbons having 15 to 55 
carbon atoms, such as paraffin (liquid paraffin, solid paraffin) and 
microcrystalline wax, oils and fats having a melting point of 60 to 90°C, such 
as carnauba wax, hardened oils, bleached beeswax and white wax, silicones 
having a viscosity of 95 to 1,050 cs, at 25°C such as silicone oil and silicone 
resin, fatty acids such as stearic acid, esters of fatty acid such as sucrose ester 
of fatty acid, glycerol ester of fatty acid and polyglycerol ester of fatty acid, 
polyhydric alcohols having a melting point of 4 to 65°C, such as stearyl 
alcohol and cetanol, and film base polymers such as shellac and ethyl 
cellulose. Paraffin, carnauba wax, white wax, silicone, stearic acid, stearyl 
alcohol and shellac are preferred. Hard capsule coating is achieved by first thermally fusing a 
physiologically acceptable water repellent (hereinafter also referred to as 
coating agent) or dissolving it in an organic solvent to prepare a coating 
solution, then applying the coating solution to the hard capsules by a  
 
conventional method using a coater. Thermal fusion of the water repellent is 
then achieved by heating it to a temperature exceeding its melting point. The 
organic solvent used to dissolve the water repellent is exemplified
