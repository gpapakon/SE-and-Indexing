<ABSTRACT>
The disc brake (100) with variable width caliper and powered actuation comprises first and second bridge members (14, 15) which are connected with a pair of movable members (20, 30) extending over the periphery of the rotor (51). Each of the movable members (20, 30) is mounted upon an anchor extension (37A, 38A). An inboard end of each movable member (20, 30) includes threads (26, 36) upon which is threadably mounted a nut (28, 29). The nut (28, 29) has ratchet teeth (12, 13) on one axial end which engage ratchet teeth (10A, 11A) of an associated actuator sleeve (10, 11) disposed slidably about the movable member (20, 30). Each actuator sleeve (10, 11) includes gear teeth (10C, 11C) about its circumference. The second bridge member (15) is mounted slidably upon the movable members (20, 30). The gear teeth (10C, 11C) of the actuator sleeves (10, 11) are engaged by a powered rack member (110) which includes a double ended piston (117) within a housing (115) defining with the piston (117) a pair of hydraulic pressure chambers (120, 122). The double ended piston (117) includes a connecting arm (125) connecting the piston (117) with a rack (130) of the powered rack member (110) so that hydraulic pressure can effect displacement of the double ended piston (117) and a corresponding lateral displacement of the rack (130). Lateral displacement of the rack (130) effects rotation of the actuator sleeves (10, 11) which, through the engaged ratchet teeth (10A, 11A; 12, 13), causes the nuts (28, 29) to rotate and effect translational movement of the movable members (20, 30). The actuator sleeves (10, 11) engage roller thrust bearings (44, 45) which, as the nuts (28, 29) change their positions along the movable members (20, 30), displace the second bridge member (15) and a friction lining mechanism (16) against the rotor (51), and by reaction, the movable members (20, 30) bring a friction lining mechanism (17) of the first bridge member (14) into engagement with the other face of the rotor (51). The second bridge member (15) may include one or more bores (50) each receiving therein a piston (52) and actuatable by hydraulic fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DISC BRAKE WITH VARIABLE WIDTH CALIPER AND POWERED ACTUATIONThis is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. Serial No. 07/704,586 filed May 22, 1991.The present invention relates generally to a disc brake, and in particular to a disc brake with a variable width caliper.Many types of disc brakes have been proposed over the years. A disc brake with a variable width type of caliper has been proposed previously in French Patent No. 1,531,556 published July 5, 1968. However, current pro- duction brake calipers typically utilize a rigid caliper structure which spans the rotor disc in order to carry inner and outer brake pads and react the clamping loads. The majority of service brake calipers contain one or more pistons which can be displaced, hydraulically, to apply the clamping forces to the shoes. As the friction pads wear, the pistons must extend from their cylinder bores and the hydraulic system must have a sufficient capacity to make up the changes in required fluid volume. It is highly desirable to provide a disc brake which can provide the service braking function by mechanical actua¬ tion and thus not require any hydraulic fluid for actua¬ tion. It is desirable that such a disc brake contain as few parts as possible, be highly reliable, and effect large clamping loads for braking. It is also advantageous if such a disc brake could contain hydraulically actuated pistons for service braking, while retaining the mechani¬ cal actuation function for parking brake applications and also provide automatic wear adjustment so that changes in fluid volume requirements are minimal. It is highly advantageous if such a disc brake comprises easily assembled members having high stiffness and low weight, resulting in the service pistons needing to travel only a distance sufficient to take up the running clearance of the brake and pad deflections. If the brake contains high stiffness and low weight components, the inherently stiff 

 caliper assembly reduces the hydraulic fluid requiremen of the brake system and also reduces the size and powe requirements of a brake booster utilized for servic braking. It is also highly desirable and advantageous t provide a hydraulically powered mechanism for actuatin the disc brake, and in particular for actuating the disc brake for parking brake applications.The above problems are solved by the present invention which comprises a disc brake with a variable width caliper and powered actuation, comprising a pair of spaced-apart movable members extending across a rotor of a vehicle,
