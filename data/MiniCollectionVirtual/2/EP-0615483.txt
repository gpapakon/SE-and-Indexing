<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an eccentric-disc grinder (1, 101, 161) with an in particular multi-component housing (3, 103, 9, 109, 162, 165) in which a motor with a shaft (16, 116, 170) turns a grinding disc (13, 113, 167) by means of an eccentric (19, 119, 173), the eccentric (19, 119, 173) driving the grinding disc (13, 113, 167) to rotate with an eccentricity "e" about a rotation axis (18, 118, 172) while simultaneously rotating about a rotational axis (26, 126, 177). The aim of the invention is to provide a compact, robust and convenient device. This aim is achieved by designing the eccentric as a hollow shaft (19, 119, 173) open at both ends and with an eccentric bore (25, 125, 176) from at least one end of which the eccentric shaft (27, 127, 178) carrying the grinding disc (13, 113, 167) projects.

<CLAIMS>
Eccentric disc grinder (1, 101, 161) having an,

in particular multi-part, housing (31 103, 9, 109, 162,
165) in which a motor with a motor shaft (16, 116, 170)

moves a grinding disc (13, 113, 167) via an eccentric
(19, 119, 173), it being the case that the eccentric

(19, 119, 173) carries the grinding disc (13, 113, 167)
along in circulating motion with eccentricity "e" about

an axis of rotation (18, 118, 172) and, at the same
time, in rotary motion about an axis (26, 126, 177)

which is eccentric by the eccentricity "e" with respect
to the axis of rotation (18, 118, 172), it being the

case that the eccentric (19, 119, 173) is configured as
a hollow shaft which is open at both ends and has an

eccentric bore (25, 125, 176), beyond which the
eccentric shaft (27, 127, 178), which bears the

grinding disc (13, 113, 167), projects at at least one
end, and it being the case that there is arranged on

that side of the eccentric shaft (27, 127, 178) which
is remote from the grinding disc (13, 113, 167) a spur

gearwheel (45, 145, 183), which rolls on a mating wheel
arranged, in particular, on a housing (9, 109, 165) and

configured as a hollow gearwheel (47, 147, 184),
characterized in that the eccentric shaft (27, 127,

178) is retained in a rotatable manner, in particular
in an axially non-displaceable manner, in at least two

bearings (29, 129, 31, 131; 179, 180) in the hollow
shaft (19, 119, 173) by virtue of the fact that a

roller bearing (31, 131, 180), in particular a needle 
bearing, for absorbing radial forces is arranged,

between the hollow shaft (19, 119, 173) and eccentric
shaft (27, 127, 178), in the vicinity of the grinding

disc (13, 113, 167) and a ball bearing (29, 129, 179)
for absorbing axial forces is arranged, between the

hollow shaft (19, 119, 173) and eccentric shaft (27,
127, 178), remote from the grinding disc (13, 113,

167), it being the case that at least one balanced
weight (33, 133, 181), serving in particular as a

ventilator, is arranged in a rotationally fixed manner
on the hollow shaft (19, 119, 173), on that side of the

latter which is remote from the spur gearwheel (45,
145, 173), and in that a bevel gearwheel (17, 117, 171)

is arranged in a rotationally fixed manner on the
hollow shaft (19, 119, 173).
Eccentric disc grinder according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the hollow gearwheel (147) is

arranged on the housing (109) in a rotatable manner
with adjustable friction, in particular in a sliding

bearing (149).
Eccentric disc grinder according to Claim 1 or
2, characterized in that the spur gearwheel (45, 145,

173) serves as balance weight.
Eccentric disc grinder according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the hollow

gearwheel (147) can be prevented from its rotary
movement by arresting means (151).
Eccentric disc grinder according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that an elastic

coupling (35) is arranged between the eccentric shaft
(27) and the grinding disc (13).
Eccentric disc grinder according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the hollow

gearwheel (184) can be displaced axially, with respect
to the spur gearwheel (183), into a coupling position

and out of the same, via adjustment means (186).
Eccentric disc grinder according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the adjustment

means comprise bolts which are connected to the hollow 
gearwheel in a rotationally fixed manner and are guided

in oblique slots in the housing.
Eccentric disc grinder according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the bolt bears at least one

clamping or latching device which can be tightened to
secure the adjustment means.
