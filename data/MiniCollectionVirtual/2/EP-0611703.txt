<ABSTRACT>
A tubular container made of a relatively soft and pliable material and 
of the type which is made from an even punched-out blank (7) which is 

fold into a tube (1) and which is closed at the top (2) and at the bottom (3) 
and is formed with a reclosing means (14) comprising an inner reclosing 

plug (5) which is initially fixedly connected to the uppermost part of the 
container sleeve, in which the container sleeve (1) is formed with an all 

around same extending weakening means (6) for making it possible to 
release the part (14) of the container sleeve located above said weakening 

means (6) together with the reclosing plug (5), thereby removing same, or 
rotating said part of the container about a hinge (18) which is formed by a 

non-perforated part (side) of the container sleeve (1), and in which the 
container sleeve (1), for stablizing the sides at the upper part of the 

container, has a sealing/closing means (4) in the form of a foil or a disc 
which is fixedly connected to the interior side of the container sleeve, and 

which has a means for providing a dispensing opening (17) therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a tubular container made of 
a relatively soft and pliable material like cardboard, a relatively soft plastic 
material, a cardboard-plastic laminate or another soft and pliable material 
and of the type which is made of a plain, even punched-out blank of such a 
material, which is fold to form a tube which is closed at the bottom thereof 
and which, after having been filled with intended goods, is also closed at 
the top thereof, and which is formed with some type of reclosing means, 
so that the container can be reclosed under at least a powder proof 
condition after it has been opened for the first time. Containers of this type are commonly used as dispensing containers 
for all kinds of dry, semi-dry or paste formed products, like flower, powder, 
grains, flakes, pastes etc, which goods need not necessarily be reclosed 
under liquid and gas proof conditions, but for which goods it is sufficient 
that the reclosing of the goods is made "powder proof". Examples of such 
goods are coffee, tea, cocoa, suger, salt, grains, powder etc. In some 
cases such containers also have been used for liquid products. The container is made so that the plain, punched-out blank, for 
instance the cardboard blank, is formed to a tube in that two side edges of 
the blank are fold together edge to edge, or are eventually placed slightly 
overlapping each other, and are secured in this position by being weld 
connected or glue connected, or still more preferably in that a weld or tape 
strip is placed over the interconnection joint; thereafter a cup-formed 
bottom piece is glued or welded to the bottom end of the container tube, in 
case the container tube is to be filled from the top; the filling alternatively 
can be made from the bottom, whereby the top is closed first; the 
container is filled with the intended goods; and it is finally formed with a 
top closure, which in this case should be of a type making the container 
reclosable, whereby is meant that is should be possible to repeatedly open 
the container for dispensing the goods thereof and thereafter to reclose the 
container under at least powder proof conditions. Heretofore the container top generally has been formed as a separate 
unit, as for instance the reclosing top of the type shown in applicant's US 
patent 5.050,763, and which comprises en edge frame which can be 
secured on the upper edge of an open container tube, and a reclosing lid  
 
which is hinge connectd to said edge frame. This type of reclosing

<CLAIMS>
A tubular container made of a relatively soft and pliable material 
like cardboard, a relatively soft plastic material, a cardboard-plastic-laminate 

or another soft and pliable material and of the type which is made of an 
even punched-out blank (7) of such material, which blank is folded into a tube 

or sleeve (1) and which is closed at the top (2) and at the bottom (3) and is 
formed with some type of reclosing means (14), so that the container, after 

it has been opened for the first time, can be reclosed under at least powder 
proof conditions, wherein the container top (2) is formed with 

an inner reclosing plug (5) which is fixedly connected to the uppermost part 
(14) of the container sleeve (1), where the container sleeve (1), all around 

same or along the greatest part of its periphery, is formed with a 
weakening means, for instance a perforation (6) for making it possible to 

release the part (14) of the container sleeve (1) located above the 
perforation (6) together with the reclosing plug (5) and to remove same or 

to rotate said part (14) about a hinge (18) provided by a non-perforated 
part of the container sleeve (1), 
characterized
 in that the container sleeve (1) for 
stabilizing the sides at the upper part of the container has a sealing means 

in the form of a foil or a disc (4) which is fixedly connected to the inner sides 
of the container sleeve, and which foil or disc has a dispensing opening 

means (17) which can be opened. 
A container according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
sealing/closing foil (4) is arranged on such a distance below the perforation 

(6) that the bottom (12) of the reclosing plug (5), when closed, is located 
just above said sealing means (4). 
A container according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the 
sealing/closing foil or disc (4) is formed with fold up rims, and in that the 

reclosing plug (5) is arranged to be located just above the fold up rims of 
the sealing/closing foil or disc (4) with the bottom (12) thereof when said 

reclosing plug (5) is in its closed position. 
A container according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 in that 
sealing/closing foil or disc (4) is sealing the container before the container 

has once been opened, and in that said foil or disc (4) is formed with a 
means for tearing open a dispensing openi
ng (17) which is of such size as  
 

to leave, after it has been torn open, an all around extending frame margin 
against the container sleeve (1) of at least 1/10th of the width of said foil. 
A container according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the container as a whole is made of a recycleable 
material, for instance of cardboard, a soil plastic material or a cardboard-plastic-laminate. 
A container according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the container sleeve (1) has a circular, oval, square or 
rectangular cross section shape. 
A container according to any of claims 1-5, 
characterized
 in that 
the container sleeve (1) has a parallelepipedical cross section shape with 

rounded corners, and in that the container sleeve, in the last mentioned 
case, is joined (9, 10) at or close to the centre of a straight part of a side, 

and in that the hinge (18) about which the reclosing plug (14) can be 
rotated in relation to the container sleeve (1) is arranged at the same side. 
A container according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized
 in that the

and/or outer joining strip (11). 
A container according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterized
 in that the 
hinge (18), about which the reclosing plug (14) can be rotated in relation to 

the container tube (1) is reinforced by an inner and/or outer reinforcing

A container according to any of claim 1-6
, characterized
 in that 
the container sleeve (1) is perforated all around same, and in that the
