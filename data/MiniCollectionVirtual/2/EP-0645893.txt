<ABSTRACT>
An improved sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter 
(ADC) is disclosed herein. The digital converter 

includes a dither circuit fabricated within the package 
of the ADC. The circuit is configured to apply a dither 

current to the analog input of the ADC. The frequency of 
the dither current is selected based upon the bandwidth 

of the analog signals for which the ADC is designed to 
sample and convert to digital signals. Application of 

the dither current to the input of the ADC reduces 
quantization noises produced as a result of certain 

ranges of DC offset voltages found within analog signals 
applied to the ADC.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analog-to-digital
converter (ADC). In particular, the present
invention is related to the reduction of quantization
noise in an ADC.One problem encountered in the design of first order
sigma-delta ADCs is the presence of certain direct
current (DC) offset voltages at the analog input of the
ADC. Such DC offset voltages are typically generated by
external circuitry or internal amplifiers. The DC offset
voltages which are particularly problematic have
amplitudes slightly offset from, but not equal to,
voltages corresponding to multiples of one-half of the
voltage represented by the least significant bit (LSB) of
the ADC. When such DC offset voltages are present, the
ADC will generate digital signals having recurrent
patterns that approximate the value of the DC offset.
Thus, the digital output of the ADC will be noisy when
the repetition rate of the patterns is within the
baseband of the ADC.A similar noise problem occurs for certain
alternating (AC) voltages when the sampling rate of the
ADC is high compared to the baseband. In this situation,
the low frequency of the AC signals, relative to the 
sampling rate, results in recurrent patterns in the digital output of the ADC which are similar
to those produced by problematic DC offset voltages.For many application, such as telecommunications, it is important to have low noise at
steady state in the absence of an input signal, and a high signal-to-noise ratio when an input
signal is present at the ADC. In both situations, it is important to eliminate or reduce the
recurrent patterns in the digital output of the ADC. Accordingly, it would be useful to
provide an improved ADC which reduces the recurrent patters in the digital output of ADCs,
such as sigma-delta ADCs, caused by certain level DC offsets and certain AC signals.US4,968,987 describes a delta-sigma modulation analog-to-digital converter which
includes a dither signal generator; a decimation filter follows the delta-sigma quantizer. The
decimation filter and the dither signal generator are driven from a common clock signal
generator so that the decimation filter can remove the dither signal.We shall describe an analog-to digital converter (ADC)comprising an analog input
to receive an analog input signal; a digital output to provide a digital output signal
representative of the analog input signal; integrator means having an input coupled to the
analog input and providing an output, for generating an output signal representative of the
integral of an analog signal
