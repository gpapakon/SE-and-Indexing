<ABSTRACT>
A high-voltage filter for filtering of two harmonics in an 
electric power network comprises a first capacitive impedance 

element (C1) arranged in a first electric circuit (L1, C1) and 
a second capacitive impedance element (C2) arranged in a second 

electric circuit (L2, C2). The first and second electric 
circuits are inductively coupled to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high-voltage filter for filtering 
of harmonics in an electric power network according to the 
precharacterising part of claim 1. The power network may, for example, consist of an a.c. network 
supplying a converter for transformation of alternating current 
into direct current or vice-versa in a power system for 
transmission of high-voltage direct current. A converter connected to an a.c. network, for example a converter 
included in a converter plant for high-voltage direct 
current, generates, by its principle of operation, harmonic 
currents on its a.c. side and harmonic voltages on its d.c. 
side. In this context, in principle, only harmonics to the 
fundamental frequency of the a.c. network of the orders n=kpÂ±1 
occur on the a.c. side and of the orders n=kp on the d.c. 
voltage side, p being the pulse number of the converter and k  
 
being a positive integer. Harmonics of other orders may also 
occur in power networks of this kind, caused by, for example, 
unsymmetries between the phases of the a.c. network. To reduce the stresses on components included in the power 
network and originating from the harmonics, and to fulfil the 
requirements made on the effect of harmonics on the network 
and telecommunication disturbances, shunt-connected filters 
are therefore generally installed to limit the propagation of 
the disturbances in the power network. Harmonics of a lower 
order, for example those which correspond to k = 1 and for 6-pulse 
converters and also k = 2, are generally filtered 
through filters tuned to these harmonics whereas harmonics of 
a higher order may be filtered through a high-pass filter. The 
filters are composed of passive components, and during the dimensioning 
it is also taken into consideration that the filters 
on the a.c. side are to serve as members for generating 
reactive power. In certain cases, it may be necessary to install 
tuned filters and high-pass filters also on the d.c. 
voltage side of the converter. In a converter plant for high-voltage 
direct current, these filters and the capacitor banks 
constitute plant components which considerably influence the 
function, volume and cost of the plant. The tuned filters are generally designed as series-resonance 
circuits, comprising capacitive, inductive and sometimes also 
resistive impedance elements, so chosen that, at one or more 
of the harmonic frequencies expected in the power network, 
they are to exhibit a purely resistive impedance. These filters 
are connected between two
