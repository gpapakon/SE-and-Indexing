<ABSTRACT>
This device is of the type consisting of a flexible link (4) generally formed of a steel cable or links of a chain, enveloped with a protective sleeve, one end (4a) of which is secured to and not removable from the structure (5) of the vehicle and the other end or free end (4b) of which is intended to be engaged and locked into the keeper (6a) of a lock (6) which is also integral with and not removable from the structure (5) of the vehicle after it has been manipulated to make it envelop a fixed object (7) such as a post or something similar. According to the invention, a second lock (8) keeper (8a) is provided, integral with the structure (5) of the vehicle, into which the free end (4b) of the flexible link (4) can be engaged after it has been manipulated so as perfectly to match a given contour of the structure of the vehicle, such as a peripheral groove (9) of the saddle support (3) or carrying box (2).

Antitheft device for a vehicle, and particularly though 
not exclusively for a two-wheeled vehicle, of the type 

comprising a flexible linkage (4), generally in the form 
of a steel cable, or of the links of a chain, covered by a 

protective sheath, one end (4a) of which is integral with 
and non-removable from the structure (5) of the vehicle, 

and the other end of which, or free end (4b), is intended 
to be engaged and locked in the keeper (6a) of a first 

lock (6) which is likewise integral with and non-removable 
from the structure (5) of the vehicle, and belonging to 

the antitheft device, after it has been manipulated to 
surround a fixed object (7) such as a post or the like, 

characterised in that the antitheft device in addition 
comprises a second lock (8), integral with the structure 

(5) of the vehicle, in the keeper (8a) of which the free 
end (4b) of the flexible linkage (4) may be engaged after 

being manipulated so as perfectly to surround a specific 
contour of the structure of the vehicle, such as a 

peripheral groove (9) of the saddle support (3) or of a 
trunk (2).  

 
Antitheft device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that at least the keyhole of the first lock (6) provided 

for immobilising the vehicle, but preferably the keyholes 
of the two locks (6, 8), are only accessible from the 

interior of the trunk (2), i.e. after the saddle (3) has 
been unlocked and raised. 
Antitheft device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the key for unlocking the two locks 

(6, 8) of the antitheft device is the same as that serving 
to open the trunk (2) located beneath the saddle (3). 
Antitheft device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the second lock (8), or the lock 

serving for the road position of the flexible linkage (4), 
is of the type which is lockable with the aid of a 

latching lever. 
Antitheft device according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the latching lever of the second lock (8) is 

accessible only through the interior of the trunk (2).
