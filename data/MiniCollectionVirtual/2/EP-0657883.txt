<ABSTRACT>
There is an information reproducing apparatus 
having a first comparator (5) for comparing a reproduction 

signal from an information recording medium such as a 
magnetooptical disc and a first reference signal, 

thereby binarizing the reproduction signal, a clock 
signal generating circuit (6) for generating a clock signal 

from the signal binarized by the first comparator, and 
a synchronous circuit (7) for synchronizing the binary 

signal by the clock signal. The apparatus comprises a 
phase comparator (8) for comparing the phase of the binary 

signal and the phase of the output of the synchronous 
circuit; a charge/discharge circuit (9) such as a charge 

pump circuit which is driven by an output of the phase 
comparator; and a second comparator (10) for comparing an 

output of the charge/discharge circuit and a second 

reference signal. The first reference signal is 
controlled by an output of the second comparator (10) 

synchronously with the binary signal or the output of 
the synchronous circuit. The second reference signal 

changes interlockingly with a change in frequency of 
the clock signal forming circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
information reproducing apparatus for binarizing a 
reproduction signal from an optical information 
recording medium. In recent years, optical recording media such as 
an optical disc and the like are rapidly being advanced 
as memories of a high density and a large capacity 
including a rewritable magnetooptical disc as well as a 
read only CD and a write once type disc. Particularly, 
the magnetooptical disc is expected as an external 
memory of a high density and a large capacity of a 
computer. In association with a large capacity of the 
disc apparatus, as means for increasing the memory 
capacity by effectively using a recording density on a 
disc, hitherto, what is called a mark position 
recording such that when information is recorded on the 
disc, "1" of the information is recorded as a pit of a 
single length has been used. In recent years, however, 
what is called a mark edge recording such that by 
providing information for edges on both sides of a pit, 
a higher density can be realized even in case of the 
same pit is becoming a main stream.  In such an optical disc, since the information has 
been recorded at a high density, it is required to 
accurately read out the recorded information upon 
reproduction. Hitherto, after magnetooptical signals 
read out from two photosensors were amplified by a 
preamplifier, a difference signal between outputs of 
the two sensors is formed, the peak value and the 
bottom value of the difference signal are further 
detected, and the difference signal is sliced at the 
center value of the peak and bottom values and is 
binarized, thereby reproducing the magnetooptical 
signal. However, in the case where the recording 
conditions are changed due to the following causes or 
the apparatus is influenced from the outside, the level 
of the reproduction signal fluctuates, so that there is 
a case where the magnetooptical signal cannot be 
accurately reproduced. 
(1) In the magnetooptical disc apparatus, the 
writing level of the magnetooptical signal differs 
every apparatus. (2) In the magnetooptical disc apparatus, the 
writing level of the magnetooptical signal differs 
every disc and the writing level also differs in 
dependence on the position on the disc. (3) In the case where a dust is deposited on the 
magnetooptical disc or the disc becomes dirty, the 
reproduction signal level complicatedly fluctuates.  (4) A waveform interference occurs by the high 
density recording. (5) The apparatus is influenced by
