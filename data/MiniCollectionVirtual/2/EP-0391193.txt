<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the production of optically isotropic extruded films of a thickness of less than 600  mu m which have either one matt surface and one glossy surface or two glossy surfaces, as well as to the extruded films which can be obtained by the process according to the invention.

Process for producing from thermoplastic materials 
optically isotropic extruded films having a thickness 

of less than 600 µm, characterised in that either 

a) an optically isotropic film which is high-gloss 
on one side and matt on the other side is 

produced from the thermoplastic material by 
extrusion and subsequent calendering between a 

face-ground elastic roller and a high-gloss steel 
roller, and the film thus produced is coated on 

the matted side thereof with the melt of the same 
thermoplastic material, the coated film thus 

obtained is calendered again between a high-gloss 
steel roller and a face-ground elastic roller, 

wherein the high-gloss side of the coated film 
faces the roller of elastic material, or 
b) an optically isotropic film which is, however, 
high-gloss on both sides is produced from the 

thermoplastic material by extrusion and 
subsequent calendering between a lacquered 

elastic roller and a high-gloss steel roller, 
 
wherein in the case of both variants a) and b) 


thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates based on 
bis-(hydroxyphenyl) alkanes and/or cycloalkanes 

or thermoplastic aromatic polyester carbonates 
are utilised as the thermoplastic materials and 

wherein the extrusion and calendering are carried 
out within the temperature range 150°C to 400°C 

and at pressures of from 50 bar to 200 bar. 
Process according to Claim 1 for producing optically 
isotropic extruded films having a thickness of from 

500 µm to 50 µm.
