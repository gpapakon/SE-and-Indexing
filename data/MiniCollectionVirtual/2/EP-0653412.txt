<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing 4,5-difluorobenzaldehydes
of the formula (I)



in which

X
represents fluorine or chlorine and
Y
represents hydrogen or chlorine,

characterized in that benzaldehydes of the formula (II)


in which X and Y are as defined for formula (I), are
reacted with a fluorinating agent.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the fluorinating agent used is sodium, potassium

and/or caesium fluoride in an amount of from 0.8 to 2 mol
per 1 mol of chlorine to be replaced in the benzaldehyde 

used.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that it is carried out in the presence

of a solvent.
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it is carried out at temperatures

in the range from 160 to 230Â°C.
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the benzaldehydes of the formula

(II) used are those which are obtainable from the corresponding
3-amino-4-chlorotoluene or the corresponding 5-amino-2,4-dichlorotoluene

by reaction with sodium nitrite
and dimethylamine and subsequent boiling down in the

presence of fluoride ions, and chlorination and acid
saponification of the fluorochlorotoluene obtainable in

this way.
