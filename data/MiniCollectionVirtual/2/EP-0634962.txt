<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a single-piece cast product having an inhomogeneous distribution of the graphite crystals in vermicular and nodular form in different parts of the finished cast product. This is achieved by adjusting the composition and physical properties of the melt or the local nucleating potential, so that the melt, in dependence on solidification time and/or the local nucleating potential, will solidify with a larger proportion of vermicular graphite crystals in those parts of the casting in which a vermicular structure is desired. In those parts in which a higher proportion of nodular graphite crystals is desired at a correspondingly smaller proportion of vermicular graphite crystals in those parts where a nodular graphite structure is desired by adjusting the local nucleation potential, it is ensured that heat is transported more rapidly away from the casting during solidification, either by providing the casting with thin sections or by placing heat-absorbing elements in the mould. The method is particularly suited for the manufacture of engine parts and power transmission parts of automotive vehicles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing
cast products which are cast as a one-piece structure having
controlled inhomogeneous graphite structure. According to the
invention, the products can be cast in a manner to obtain,
for instance, a vermicular graphite structure in certain
parts thereof and a nodular graphite structure in other parts
thereof, therewith imparting to the cast product different
properties in different parts of said product.Compacted graphite iron or cast iron having a vermicular
graphite structure is an intermediate form between gray cast
iron having a flaky graphite structure and ductile iron
having a nodular graphite structure.Compacted graphite cast iron possesses desirable and unique
properties, which include good mechanical and physical properties
and good machinability, which makes the material
highly suitable for a number of mechanical components in
machine constructions. This includes machine constructions
that are manufactured in large numbers, chiefly engines and,
for instance, pumps particularly for motor vehicles. Iron-dependent,
highly qualified materials and machining methods
are not normally used for specialty products, such as aircraft
engines, and when particularly high demands are placed
on the products, and the manufacture of such products therefore
lies outside the scope of the present invention.Compacted graphite iron will thus contain graphite that has
precipitated in the form of vermicular graphite and is defined
according to ISO/R 945-1969(E) as "Form III"- graphite
or "Type IV"-graphite in accordance with ASTM A 247. The
graphite form was first described in England (1948) and has 
since been used for the manufacture of special components on
a small scale. The reason for this small scale of manufacture
is because it has not been possible to control the properties
and composition of the iron melts with sufficient accuracy to
guarantee the composition and graphite structure of the cast
product with sufficient reproducibility.The properties of compacted graphite iron lie somewhere
between the properties of gray iron and ductile iron. For
instance, the elasticity module of compacted graphite iron is
from 30-40% higher than the elasticity module of gray iron,
which means that the elasticity module of compacted graphite
iron is almost the same as that of ductile iron. Compacted
graphite cast iron has a ductility which is higher than that
of gray iron, often more than ten times higher than that of
gray iron, and has a much higher tensile strength,

A method for the manufacture of single-piece cast iron
products having an inhomogeneous distribution of the graphite

crystals in vermicular and nodular form in different parts of
the finished cast product, 
characterized
 by adjusting the
composition and physical properties of the melt or the local

nucleating potential so that, in dependence on solidification
time and/or the local nucleating potential, the melt will

solidify with a larger proportion of vermicular graphite
crystals and a correspondingly smaller proportion of nodular

graphite crystals in those parts of the casting in which a
vermicular graphite structure is desired; and by ensuring in

parts in which a higher proportion of nodular graphite crystals
is desired by adjusting the local nucleation potential

that heat is rapidly transported away from the casting during
solidification, either by forming said casting parts with

thin sections or by providing the mould with heat-absorbing
elements such that the mould temperature in said parts can be

lowered for a sufficiently short time period to obtain the
desired degree of nodularity.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized

the composition and physical properties of the melt so

that the content of a modifying agent will be equivalent to
a content of 0.010-0.025

of some other modifying agent.
A method according to Claim 1 and 2, 
characterized
 by
configuring the cast product such that where a predominant

nodular graphite structure is desired cooling in the region
of 1,150-1,000°C is at least 5 Ks

automotive vehicle, such as a car, truck, bus or railway
carriage, 
characterized

A flywheel manufactured in accordance with the method of
Claims 1-4, 
characterized
 in that the flywheel is cast in a
sand mould with a melt that contains 0.010-0.025 active dissolved

magnesium or equivalent amounts of some other modifying
agent, and with a thickness in the hub parts of the

flywheel of between 4 and 8 mm and a thickness of 25-35 mm in
outer parts of the flywheel having surfaces for contact with

clutch discs.
