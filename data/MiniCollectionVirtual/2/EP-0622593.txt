<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises at least one compartmentalised reactor (2) having a solid sorbent (4) or sorbents which is(are) capable of fixing at least one refrigerant and in contact with a heat exchanger (6), means for the alternate circulation of a heat-transfer fluid (10) between a hot source (8) and a cold source (12), via the exchanger, in order to create, in the sorbent, a temperature front moving through the compartments, a condenser (22), and an evaporator (24). The thermal conductivity and the permeability of the sorbent are lower parallel to the movement of the heat-transfer fluid in the exchanger than perpendicular to this movement. Means (28, 32, V1 to V16) for circulating the gaseous refrigerant create a pressure front moving through the compartments together with the temperature front.

Apparatus for refrigeration and heating comprising:

at least one reactor (2, 2a) containing at least one solid sorbent (4) able
to fix at least one refrigerating fluid and which is in contact with a heat

exchanger (6),
at least one hot source (8, 8a, 8b) for heating a heat transfer fluid and
at least one cold source (12, 12a, 12b) for cooling said heat transfer fluid,

means (14, 16; 52, 54) for the alternative circulation of the heat transfer
fluid between the hot source and the cold source, by means of the heat

exchanger,
at least one condenser (22) for condensing the refrigerating fluid released
by the solid sorbent when the latter is heated as a result of the heat

transfer fluid,
at least one evaporator (24) at a lower pressure than that of the condenser
for vaporizing the refrigerating fluid so that the latter is fixed to the

solid sorbent when it is cooled by means of the heat transfer fluid,
a means (26) for returning the refrigerating fluid in the liquid phase from

the condenser to the evaporator and
means for circulating the refrigerating fluid in the gaseous phase from the
evaporator to the reaction and then from the latter to the condenser,

said apparatus being characterized in that the reactor comprises a plurality
of compartments (C1 to C7), which are separated from one another and successively

traversed by the heat transfer fluid displaced in the heat exchanger,
each compartment containing part of the solid sorbent,
the solid sorbent is a composite material, whose thermal conductivity and
permeability are lower parallel to the displacement of the heat transfer

fluid (10) in the heat exchanger (6) than perpendicular to said displacement,
the cooling fluid circulation means comprise successive communication means

the evaporator and the condenser in the heat transfer fluid displacement
direction, in order to in this way create in the reactor a temperature front

which successively passes through the compartments from the first to the
last compartment and a pressure front successively passing through the

compartments with the temperature front.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the refrigerating
fluid circulating means comprise:


at least one duct (48, 48a) connecting the condenser (22) to the evaporator
(24), pipes (30, 30a) respectively connecting the compartments (C1 to C7)

to said duct (48, 48a) and
retractable sealing means (v1 to v8; v1a to v8a) for the duct able to displace
the pressure front in the reactor between individual compartments.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the refrigerating
fluid circulating means comprise:


at least one first duct (28) linking the reactor with the condenser (22),
a first group of pipes (30, 30a) respectively connecting the compartments

(C1 to C7) to said first duct (28),
at least one second duct (32) linking the reactor with the evaporator (24),
a second group of pipes (34, 34a) respectively connecting the compartments

(C1 to C7) to said duct (32) and
retractable sealing means (V1 to V16; V1a to V16a) for the first and second

ducts and the first and second groups of pipes able to displace the said
pressure front in the reactor between the individual compartments.

circulating means are provided for circulating a heat transfer fluid in each
reactor from the hot source (8, 8a) to the cold source (12, 12a) of one of

said reactors and simultaneously from the cold source (12, 12a) to the hot
source (8, 8a) of the other reactor.
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that it comprises a
single hot source (8b), a single cold source (12b) and a single heat transfer

fluid, which are common to both reactors (2, 2a). 
Apparatus according to either of the claims 6 and 7, characterized in
that it comprises a single condenser (22), a single evaporator (24), and a

single refrigerating fluid, which are common to both reactors (2, 2a).
