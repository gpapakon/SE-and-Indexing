<ABSTRACT>
A method for the production of azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic acids of 
general formula; 


where n is a whole number of from 2 to 16, Y is H, an alkyl or alkenyl, a 
substituted alkyl, or an aryl, such that the group "Y" remains unchanged 

during the reaction,
 

by reaction of a lactam with a phosphorus trihalide in the presence of 
phosphorous acid and/or water, in which the reaction mixture also 

includes an organic amine and/or or an organic amine salt, said reaction 
being followed by hydrolysis of the reaction mixture and purification of 

the reaction product to obtain the diphosphonic acid. 
The method is exemplified by the preparation of azacycloheptane-2,2-diphosphonic 
acid, and azacyclononane-2,2-diphosphonic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method for the production of
acids and to azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic
acids obtained thereby. The present invention will be
described herein with particular reference to azacycloheptane-2,2-diphosphonic
acid and to azacyclononane-2,2-diphosphonic acid, although
it is not to be construed as being limited thereto.Throughout this description, the term "azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic
acid" denotes a compound of the general formula

where n is a whole number of from 2 to 16 and Y is H, an alkyl or
alkenyl, a substituted alkyl or an aryl group, such that the group "Y"
remains unchanged during the reaction.The preparation of azacycloheptane-2,2-diphosphonic acid (hereinafter
AHP) has been described in US-A-3941772, DE-A-2541981 and DE-A-3808074.
The preparation of other azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic acids,
has been described in DE-A-4114586. All of these prior dents suggest
that the use of toxic and/or expensive solvents (e.g. chlorobenzene,
dioxane, and glycols) are essential in order to prevent the reaction
mixture from becoming unstirrable and/or the reaction itself becoming
unreproducible, and/or uneconomical due to the low yields of product
obtained. It has now been discovered that the addition of an organic amine and/or
amine salt (e.g. an amine hydrochloride, amine hydrobromide or an amine
salt of phosphorous acid) to a reaction mixture including a lactam, a
phosphorus trihalide, phosphorous acid and/or water, followed by
hydrolysis and subsequent purification of the product, leads to the
production of the corresponding azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic acid, in
good yield, with the reaction mixture remaining stirrable throughout the
reaction.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the production
of azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic acids of general formula;

where n is a whole number of from 2 to 16 and Y is H, an alkyl or alkenyl,
a substituted alkyl, or an aryl, such that the group "Y" remains
unchanged during the reaction, by the reaction of a lactam with a
phosphorus trihalide, in the presence of phosphorous acid and/or water,
in which the reaction mixture also includes an organic amine and/or an
organic amine salt, followed by hydrolysis of the reaction mixture and
purification of the reaction product to obtain the diphosphonic acid.The present invention also provides azacycloalkane-2,2-diphosphonic acids
produced by the method described in the immediately-preceding paragraph. The lactam may be, for example,
