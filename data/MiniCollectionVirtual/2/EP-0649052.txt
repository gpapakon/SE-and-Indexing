<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for the preparation of a hybrid direct 
positive silver halide emulsion comprising the steps of (1) forming 

an essentially cubic host grain emulsion consisting of silver 
bromide or silver iodobromide, with a iodide content between 0 and 

10 mole %, by a balanced double jet, (2) depositing epitaxially on 
the corners of said formed essentially cubic host grains a silver 

iodide crystallographic phase wherein said silver iodide phase 
contains at most 5 % of the total crystal silver halide, either by 

precipitating a silver chloride epitaxial phase and converting it to 
silver iodide, or by adding silver ions and an organic iodide 

releaser. 
The organic iodide releaser is preferably mono-iodoacetic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation
of a new type of direct positive photographic emulsion and to a
photographic material containing such an emulsion.Hybrid silver halide emulsions comprising a first crystal phase,
usually called "host grain", and a second crystal phase of different
halide composition epitaxially deposited on selected sites of the
host grain are known for quite some time in the art of photographic
emulsion making. For instance, epitaxial deposition of a silver
chloride or bromide phase on silver iodide host grains was described
by Maskasky in US 4,094,684, US 4,124,900 and US 4,158,565. US
4,496,652 discloses negative or direct positive tetradecahedral
emulsions on whose (111) faces a second phase is deposited by a
second double jet of silver and halide salts. Further teachings on
host grains rich in iodide to which another halide phase is
epitaxially junctered include JP-B-88/043733 and JP-B-88/042768
(JP-B- meaning Examined Japanese Patent Publication) and
EP 0 019 917. Internal latent image type silver halide particles to
wich a surface sensitive epitaxial phase is adjoined are disclosed
in JP-B-88/43734. A photothermographic material containing an
epitaxial emulsion is described in JP-A-58-046339 (JP-A- meaning
Unexamined Japanes Patent Publication). Tabular grains having
epitaxial deposition are for the first time disclosed by Maskasky in
US 4,435,501. Maskasky US 4,463,087 reveals silver halide grains
predominantly bounded by (111) crystal faces to which a so-called
"site director" is adsorbed before the epitaxial deposition takes
place. Further Maskasky disclosures include US 4,459,353 and
4,471,050. Other additions and improvements on the teachings on
epitaxial emulsions can be found a.o. in US 4,735,894,
JP-A-61-088252, JP-A-61-279848, US 4,888,272, JP-A-63-264739,
JP-A-63-274943, JP-A-63-316048, JP-A-01-077045, JP-A-01-113745,
JP-A-01-179140, JP-A-01-213638, JP-A-01-205151 and JP-A-01-213636.Almost all of the teachings on epitaxial emulsions deal with
negative working emulsions or with crystallographic aspects only. As
far as we are aware, only US 4,496,652, cited above, discloses 
either a chemically ripened negative host grain emulsion or an
externally fogged direct positive host grain emulsion.With externally fogged direct positive emulsions it is not easy
to reach the high sensitivity level which can be obtained with
internal latent image type direct positive emulsions, which are
developed by fogging development, e.g. by using hydrazines.

Process for the preparation of a hybrid direct positive silver
halide emulsion comprising the following steps:


(1) forming an essentially cubic host grain emulsion consisting
of silver bromide or silver iodobromide, with a iodide content

between 0 and 10 mole %, by a balanced double jet precipitation
of silver ion and halide ion solutions at a pAg between 7 and 9;
(2) depositing epitaxially on the corners of said formed
essentially cubic host grains a silver iodide crystallographic

phase wherein said silver iodide phase contains at most 5 % of
the total crystal silver halide, either by,


(2.1) performing a second balanced double jet precipitation of a
silver ion solution and a chloride ion solution at a pAg

between 7 and 9, and then adding an amount of iodide ions at
least equimolar to the chloride ions, in this way converting the

formed epitaxial silver chloride phase into an epitaxial silver
iodide phase;

or,
(2.2) adding a silver ion solution and a solution of an organic

iodide releasing compound represented by formula (R) to the
emulsion grains formed according to step (1);

surface of said hybrid emulsion crystals.

substituted alkylene, unsubstituted or substituted oxyalkylene,
unsubstituted or substituted aralkylene, or combinations of two
