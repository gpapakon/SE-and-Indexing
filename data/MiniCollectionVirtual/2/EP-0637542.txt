<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a vehicle for removing toilet waste from passenger aircraft, at least one retaining container (4, 5) for the faeces and a clean-water or flushing-water container (3) are fitted, in the form of a flat structure. At the rear of the vehicle, an operating chamber (10) can be raised from its rest position via a vertically fitted piston drive (9) and a stabilizer is provided for the operating chamber (10) and the piston drive (9), which stabilizer is hinged about transverse shafts (19, 21) there and at a distance from the piston drive (9) on the vehicle. A flexible connecting part (12) of a line (12, 14, 15, 23) which leads to the retaining container (4, 5) for the faeces can be manipulated from the chamber. The stabilizer (14) consists of two guide levers (15, 16), which are connected at their ends pointing away from the chamber via a transverse shaft (17) to form half of a scissor joint and can be spread out of the folded rest position, and the faeces line is guided along these guide levers, the retaining container (4, 5) for the faeces being connectable at least to the suction side of an air pump.

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle for disposing of the contents of toilets 
of passenger aircraft, comprising at least one 

receiving container (4, 5) for feces and a clean or 
wash water container (3) in the form of a flat 

superstructure, with a working cubicle (10) provided at 
the end of the vehicle and raisable, via an upright 

piston drive (9), above its position of rest provided 
at superstructure level, comprising a stabiliser (14) 

for the cubicle (10) and the piston drive (9), said 
stabiliser (14) being articulated to the top end of the 

piston drive (9) or to the cubicle (10) itself and 
pivotable at a distance from the piston drive (9) on 

the vehicle about transverse axes (19, 21), and 
comprising a flexible connecting part (12) which can be 

manipulated from the cubicle (10) and which forms part 
of a line (12, 14, 15, 23) leading along the stabiliser 

(14) to a receiving container (4, 5), characterised in 
that the stabiliser (14) consists of two links (15, 16) 

which are connected via a transverse axis (17) to form 
a half-scissors at their ends remote from the cubicle, 

said links (15, 16) being adapted to open out of the 
closed position of rest, the feces line (12, 14, 15, 

23) extends along said links (15, 16) and the receiving 
container (4, 5) for the feces is connectable at least 

to the intake side of an air pump, the receiving 
chambers of the receiving tank (4, 5) for the feces and 

the wash or clean water container (3) each being 
constructed to be substantially symmetrical with 

respect to the vehicle longitudinal axis.  
 
A vehicle according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the two links of the half-scissors (14) themselves 

consist of tubes (15, 16) forming the feces line and 
are connected via a tubular flexurally stiff rotary 

joint (17). 
A vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that one of the two receiving containers (3, 4, 5), 

more particularly the receiving container (4, 5) for 
the feces, consists of two elongate component 

containers (4, 5) which are substantially cylindrical 
in their cross-section and which are interconnected via 

transverse lines (6) and which are disposed on either 
side of the other receiving container, which is 

constructed as a flat tank (3). 
A vehicle according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the top of the flat tank (3) is 

lower than the apex of the component containers (4, 5) 
by an amount corresponding to the closed height of the 

half-scissors (14).
