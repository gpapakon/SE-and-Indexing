<ABSTRACT>
A SLM-based projection display system (10) samples and processes 
video data for delivery to a spatial light modulator (SLM) (13c), and uses a 

color wheel (14a) to color the SLM-generated images. A frame memory (13b) 
provides data to the SLM (13c) and is managed so that, if the phase of the 

incoming video signal changes, a desired phase relationship between the 
color wheel position and the data available to the SLM (13c) can be 

maintained. Also, a motor control unit (15a) uses a horizontal sync signal to 
generate a drive signal for the color wheel motor (16a), which limits the 

transient time during phase-changing events, and which provides a means 
for adjusting the phase of the drive signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image display systems, and more particularly
to a video display system as defined in the precharacterizing part of
claim 1.In EP-A-0 530 762 a video display system is disclosed in
which a control signal is used to initialize the system,
either at power-up or after a channel change. During a
channel change the horizontal blanking signal is used to
blank the entire array of mirrors of the spatial light
modulator.In US-A-4 197 558 a video display system is disclosed
in which a color wheel is used for generating a color
television picture.Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are increasingly used in projection
display applications. A DMD is a type of SLM having an array of micromechanical
mirror elements, each individually addressable by electronic
data. Depending on the state of its addressing signal, each mirror element is
moved so that it either does or does not reflect light to an image plane.For SLM-based display applications, the incoming video signal must
be converted to binary data in a form useable by the SLM. As a result of
being converted from analog to digital form, the data is first arranged pixel-by-pixel,
row-by-row, and frame-by-frame. If the data was interlaced, the
data may also require scan conversion from fields to frames. For example, a
DMD displays one bit per mirror element at a time. In other words, the
image reflected by the DMD at any one moment represents a set of bits
having the same binary weight. Thus, before delivery to the SLM, the data
must be reformatted into "bit-planes". For pixels having an n-bit resolution,
there are n bit-planes per image frame.U.S. Patent Serial No. 07/678,761 (US-A-5 278 652), entitled "DMD Architecture and
Timing for Use in a Pulse-Width Modulated Display System", describes a
type of DMD-based projection display system. It also describes a method of
formatting video data for use with such a system, and a method of
modulating bit-planes to provide varying intensity.  Color images are generated from bit-planes representing different
colors. As an example, video data might have 24 bits of data per pixel.
Assuming that the colors are red, green, and blue, of these 24 bits, 8 bits
would be red data, 8 bits for green, and 8 bits for blue. One complete video
frame would be comprised of 24 bit-plane images.One technique for providing a color image is to use a white light source
and a color filter in front of the SLM. In one such design, the white light
illuminates the SLM, and the color filter is placed between the SLM and the
image

A video display system (10) that uses a spatial light

modulator (SLM) (13c) and a motor-driven color wheel (14a),
such that a color-phase relationship exists between data

available to the SLM (13c) and position of the color wheel

instant, including a phase change occurrence; and
a pointer control unit (15a) is provided for generating a
