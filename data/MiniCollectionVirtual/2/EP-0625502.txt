<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed a process for producing methyl 
formate by dehydrogenating methanol in liquid phase in the 

presence of a solid catalyst and a process according thereto 
wherein a gas (N₂, H₂, CO, etc.) is continuously blown into 

the liquid phase from outside, and the gas along with the 
reaction product are continuously withdrawn outside the 

reaction system from the gaseous phase directly or through a 
cooler. By virtue of the liquid-phase reaction in the above 

process, as compared with the conventional gaseous phase 
reaction, the reaction temperature can be lowered, the 

reaction gas rich in the objective methyl formate rather than 
methanol is obtained by continuously withdrawing the 

resultant methyl formate outside the reaction system and 
accordingly, a single pass yield higher than that at the 

thermodynamical equilibrium-value is assured, whereby energy 
saving is made possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing methyl formate by the dehydrogenation of methanol. Methyl formate is a product for chemical industries 
which is important as an intermediate to be used for 
producing organic chemicals such as dimethylformamide and 
formic acid, carbon monoxide and the like. It is known that methyl formate is produced by a 
process wherein methanol is carbonylized into methyl formate 
under pressure by the use of a catalyst such as sodium 
alcoholate according to the chemical equation 
CH3OH + CO → HCOOCH3 
or a process in which methanol is catalytically 
dehydrogenated into methyl formate according to the chemical 
equation 
2CH3OH → HCOOCH3 + 2H2The production of methyl formate by the dehydrogenation 
of methanol is industrially put into practice at the present 
time due to the recent progress of development of catalysts 
and a variety of catalysts proposed. There are disclosed, as 
examples of dehydrogenation catalyst, a catalyst comprising 
copper and an element belonging to group 3a of the periodic 
table in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6412/1981; a 
catalyst comprising copper, an actinide and an rare-earth 
element in Japanese Patent Publication No. 46819/1978; a 
catalyst comprising copper, zinc, an oxide of aluminum and  
 
zirconium in Japanese Patent Publication No. 46821/1978; a 
catalyst comprising copper and a cement in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 15820/1982; a catalyst comprising copper, 
calcium and a zirconium compound in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 44655/1982; and a catalyst comprising copper, 
zinc, an oxide of aluminum, an alkali-metal compound and a 
phosphorus compound in Japanese Patent Publication No. 
33418/1984 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 
151047/1991. The production of methyl formate by the dehydrogenation 
of methanol usually attains only several tens percent of 
yield because of equilibrium conditions. In the case of 
carrying out the dehydrogenation reaction under pressure 
taking into consideration the collection of low boiling 
methyl formate, the yield thereof is further lowered. In the 
case of effecting the reaction in gaseous phase, therefore, 
it is forced to cool reactor outlet gas for separating gas 
from liquid, separate methyl formate from the mixture of the 
condensed methyl formate and unreacted methanol, and 
thereafter recycle a large amount of the separated methanol 
through the dehydrogenation reaction step, causing a 
disadvantage that a large amount of energy is required. If
