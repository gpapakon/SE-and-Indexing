<CLAIMS>
A method of applying a lacquer film which is sensitive to
UV and/or electron beam radiation to a substrate to be

masked, characterized by the following method steps:

vaporizing a vinyl-containing substance and a linear or
cyclic siloxane; and
depositing these substances from the gas phase onto the
substrate to be masked.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in

that the siloxane is octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in

that the vinyl-containing substance is trivinylmethylsilane.
A method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized
by the following method steps:


dosing the substances with the aid of liquid mass flow
control means;
vaporizing the substances;
distributed introduction of the vaporized substances in
a reaction chamber by means of a discharge shower; and
reaction of the substances in an HF field.
A method according to one of the claims 1 to 4,, characterized 
in

that deposition of the substances from the gas phase is
carried out at a pressure of 0.3 to 1.5 mbar.
A method according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized
in

that the reaction is carried out at an HF power density
of from 0.06 to 0.6 W/cm
2
.
A method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized
in

that the temperature of the substrate is between 20 and
90Â°C.
