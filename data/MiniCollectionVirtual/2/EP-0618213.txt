<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for the preparation of oxyglutaric 
acid ester derivatives of the formula: 


in which each of R¹ and R² is alkoxy of 1-5 carbon atoms, 
aralkyloxy of 7-9 carbon atoms, a halogenoaralkyloxy of 7-9 

carbon atoms or phenyl, R⁴ is a hydroxyl-protecting group, 
and R⁵ is alkyl of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, comprising the 

steps of reacting a methyl phosphonate derivative or methyl 
phosphine oxide derivative with an oxyglutaric acid mono-ester 

to give a reaction product comprising an oxyglutaric 
acid derivative into which a phosphorus-containing group is 

introduced, purifying the reaction product to isolate the 
oxyglutaric acid derivative, and converting the derivative 

into its oxyglutaric acid ester derivative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for
the preparation of oxyglutaric acid ester derivatives, and
particularly relates to a process for preparing optically
active oxyglutaric acid ester derivatives which are useful
as intermediates for preparing blood cholesterol reducing
agents [e.g., 4-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric Co-A reductase
inhibitor].It is known that oxyglutaric acid ester derivatives
are useful as intermediates for preparing blood cholesterol
reducing agent [e.g., 4-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric Co-A
reductase inhibitor]. For example, a process for preparing
a blood cholesterol reducing agent (e.g., compactin) from
methyl (R)-3-t-butyldimethylsilyloxy-6-dimethoxyphosphinyl-5-oxohexanoate
(optically active oxyglutaric acid ester
derivative) is described in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry
[J. Med. Chem., 30(1987), No.10, pp. 1858-1873].As a process for preparing the optically active oxyglutaric
acid ester derivative, U.S. Patent No. 4,804,770
discloses the following process: An oxyglutaric acid monoalkyl
ester of which hydroxyl group is protected (represented
by formula (II) mentioned hereinafter) is reacted
with dimethyl methylphosphonate (represented by formula (I)
mentioned hereinafter) in the presence of n-butyl lithium
at -78°C to give a reaction product comprising phosphonated 
oxyglutaric acid derivative (represented by formula (III)
mentioned hereinafter), and the reaction product is then
reacted with diazomethane to give a reaction product comprising
the desired ketophosphonate (methylester of the
phosphonated oxyglutaric acid derivative), i.e., the above-mentioned
optically active oxyglutaric acid ester derivative
(represented by formula (IV) mentioned hereinafter).The above process is simple and appears advantageous.
However, according to the study conducted by the present
inventors, the reaction product finally obtained by the
above process comprises the desired optically active oxyglutaric
acid ester derivative as well as a large amount of
impurities. Further, it has been noted that the desired
oxyglutaric acid ester derivative and some impurities are
analogous in their chemical structures to each other.
Therefore, it is not easy to separate the desired oxyglutaric
acid ester derivative from the impurities by industrially
applicable methods.WO 92/22560 corresponding to EP-A-0 554 455 relates
to a process for synthesizing an optically active starting
material, represented by general formula (I), for
various medicines with a high optical purity in a good
yield, wherein R1
