<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a disk drive for removable storage medium disk cartridges such as commonly 
known 3.5" floppy disks. A chucking mechanism of the disk drive comprises a spindle (3) fixed 

to the rotor of a drive motor and adapted to enter into a center hole of a disk hub of the disk 
cartridge, a rotary plate (4) fixed to said spindle (3), a disk hub support member (3a) fixed to 

said spindle (3) and protruding from the upper surface of said rotary plate (4) in the axial 
direction, and a chucking lever (8) carrying a drive pin (5) for engagement with a drive hole of 

the disk hub. The chucking lever is slidably supported on said rotary plate (4). Latch means 
(4a) are provided to keep the drive pin (5) substantially immovable in the axial direction, and 

means (9, 9a) that restrict the movement of the chucking lever (8) on the surface of said rotary 
plate (4) relative to the latter. The chucking lever (8) and the drive pin (5) are arranged such as 

to apply a centering force and a rotational force to the disk hub.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to disk drives for removable storage media disk 
means such as those corresponding to the Japanese Industrial Standard 90 mm flexible disk 
cartridges or the commonly used so-called 3.5" floppy disks. More particularly, the invention 
relates to the chucking mechanism of the disk drive. As disclosed in US-A-5,121,272 for instance, there are conventional disk drives which are 
designed to center and rotate a disk of such disk cartridge type. The disk cartridge comprises, 
within a housing or jacket, a storage medium disk with a disk hub in the center of the disk. The 
disk hub has a first centrally located center hole and a second eccentrically located drive hole. 
When mounted to the disk drive, the center hole receives a spindle fixed to the rotor of a drive 
motor of the disk drive. The diameter of the spindle is smaller than the center hole so that 
engagement of the spindle with the center hole alone does ensure a definite centered position 
of the disk in the disk drive. The chucking mechanism of the disk drive includes a drive roller or 
drive pin arranged to rotate together with the spindle. The drive pin is adapted to be received in 
the drive hole of the disk hub in order to apply both a rotational force and a centering force to 
the disk hub. The centering force causes a portion of the edge of the center hole to be urged 
into abutment against the spindle thereby holding the disk in a definite centered position 
relative to the spindle axis. The disk hub is typically made from a magnetic material and the 
disk drive includes a chucking magnet for attracting and holding the disk hub which has the 
disk attached to it, to a support member of the disk drive, typically a spindle hub fixed to the 
spindle or integral with it. US-A-5,121,272 discloses such disk drive in which a spindle hub for supporting the disk hub is 
fixed to the spindle. A drive roller is mounted to one end of a chucking lever which is disposed 
below the spindle hub. The drive roller extends through a hole provided in the spindle hub and 
protrudes from the upper surface of the spindle hub so as to be able to enter into to the drive 
hole of the disk hub when the latter is inserted into the disk drive. Another end of the chucking 
lever is pivotally connected to the spindle hub. The pivot between the spring biased chucking 
lever and the spindle hub is structured such as to allow movement of the drive roller both, in a 
direction parallel to the spindle axis and a direction

A disk drive for removable storage medium disk cartridges which have, housed in a 
jacket, a storage medium disk (1) and a disk hub (2) fixed to a central portion of the disk (1), 

the disk hub (2) being provided with a center hole (2a) and an eccentrically located, 
substantially rectangular drive hole (2b), said disk drive comprising a chucking mechanism for 

chucking the disk means when inserted into the disk drive, said chucking mechanism 
comprising: 

   a spindle (3) fixed to the rotor of a drive motor and adapted to enter into said center 
hole (2a), 

   a rotary plate (4) fixed to or integral with said spindle (3), and having a surface 
extending substantially perpendicularly to the spindle (3), 

   a support member (3a) fixed to or integral with said spindle (3) and protruding from 
the upper surface of said rotary plate (4) in the axial direction for providing support for said 

disk hub (2), 
   a chucking lever (8) carrying a drive pin (5) for engagement with said drive hole (2b), 

the chucking lever being supported directly or via an interposed member on said rotary plate 
(4) to be slidable in a plane substantially perpendicular to the axis of said spindle, 

   latch means (4a, 8a; 4b, 8b, 8c; 9c) for keeping said drive pin (5) substantially 
immovable in the axial direction of the spindle (3), and 

   means (9, 9a; 4b, 8b, 4c, 8d) for restricting the movement of the chucking lever (8) 
in said plane relative to said rotary plate, 

   wherein said chucking lever (8) and the drive pin (5) are arranged such that when said 
spindle (3) is rotated and the disk (1) driven by virtue of engagement between the disk hub (2) 

and the drive pin (5), an acute angle is formed between the direction of the force (F) applied by 
the drive pin to the disk hub (2) and the line (L) connecting the center of the spindle (3) to the 

point at which the drive pin (5) contacts the disk hub (2) in the circumferential direction. 
The disk drive of claim 1, wherein said rotary plate (4) is formed by the rotor of the 
drive motor. 
The disk drive of claim 1 or 2, wherein said chucking mechanism includes a 
chucking magnet (9) disposed on said rotary plate (4), the chucking lever (8) being disposed 

within a hole (9a) or a recess provided in the chucking magnet. 
The disk drive of claim 3, wherein the chucking magnet (9) forms said restricting 
means, the hole (9a) or recess in the chucking magnet defining the range of movement of the 

chucking lever (8). 
The disk drive of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the plane defined by a 
peripheral line along which the top surface of the drive pin (5) is joined to its outer surface is 

slanted with respect to the axis of the spindle (3), and the amount by which said drive pin (5), 
 

at the lower side of said slanted plane, protrudes from said support member is no more than 
0.7 mm. 
The disk drive of claim 5, wherein the slanted plane declines towards the spindle 
(3), towards the drive pin advancing direction, or towards a direction intermediate 

therebetween. 
The disk drive of claim 6, wherein the slanted plane declines towards the spindle 
(3), and the angle formed between this plane and the axis of the spindle (3) is substantially 

equal to the angle formed between the disk hub (2) and the axis of the spindle (3) when the 
lower surface of disk hub (2) engages the drive pin top surface. 
The disk drive of claim 7, wherein the difference between the two angles is within 
±2 degrees.
