<ABSTRACT>
5,6-Dehydronorketamine and derivatives retaining the α,β-unsaturated 
carbonyl are disclosed. These and other Michael or Michael-type acceptors and 

adducts are shown to influence the replication, differentiation or maturation of blood 
cells, especially platelet progenitor cells. Accordingly, these compounds are used for 

treatment of thrombocytopenia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to Michael substrates or acceptors, especially 
certain ketamine analogues. In particular, it relates to compounds that influence the 
replication, differentiation or maturation of blood cells, especially platelet progenitor 
cells. This application further relates to the use of ketamine analogues and other 
Michael substrates to treat thrombocytopenia. In the bone marrow pluripotent stem cells differentiate into megakaryocytic, 
erythrocytic, and myelocytic cell lines. It is believed there is a line of committed cells 
between stem cells and megakaryocytes. The earliest recognizable member of the 
megakaryocyte (meg) family are the megakaryoblasts. These cells are initially 20 to 
30 µm in diameter having basophilic cytoplasm and a slightly irregular nucleus with 
loose, somewhat reticular chromatin and several nucleoli. Later, megakaryoblasts 
may contain up to 32 nuclei, but the cytoplasm remains sparse and immature. As 
maturation proceeds, the nucleus becomes more lobulate and pyknotic, the cytoplasm 
increases in quantity and becomes more acidophilic and granular. The most mature 
cells of this family may give the appearance of releasing platelets at their periphery. 
Normally, less than 10% of megakaryocytes are in the blast stage and more than 50% 
are mature. Arbitrary morphologic classifications commonly applied to the 
megakaryocyte series: are megakaryoblast for the earliest form; promegakaryocyte or 
basophilic megakaryocyte for the intermediate form; and mature (acidophilic, granular, 
or platelet-producing) megakaryocyte for the late forms. The mature megakaryocyte  
 
extends filaments of cytoplasm into sinusoidal spaces where they detach and fragment 
into individual platelets (Williams et al., Hematology, 1972). Megakaryocytopoiesis is believed to involve several regulatory factors (Williams 
et al., Br. J. Haematol.,52:173 [1982] and Williams et al., J. Cell Physiol.110:101 
[1982]). The early level of megakaryocytopoiesis is postulated as being mitotic, 
concerned with cell proliferation and colony initiation from CFU-meg but is not affected 
by platelet count (Burstein et al., J. Cell Physiol. 109:333 [1981] and Kimura et al., 
Exp. Hematol.13:1048 [1985]). The later stage of maturation is non-mitotic, 
involved 
with nuclear polyploidization and cytoplasmic maturation and is probably regulated in 
a feedback mechanism by peripheral platelet number (Odell et al., Blood48:765 
[1976] and Ebbe et al., Blood32:787 [1968]). The existence of a distinct and
