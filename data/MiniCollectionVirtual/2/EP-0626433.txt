<ABSTRACT>
A sprayable, high solids, low-volatiles filler composition 
is provided which may be used as a coating on a variety of 

substrates. The sprayable filler composition comprises a first 
filler/glazing component formed from a mixture of a resin, a 

filler, a mixture of thixotropic clays, activated fumed silica, 
hollow glass microspheres, and a ketone solvent. The sprayable 

filler composition has a second catalyst component. The 
glazing/filler component is blended with the catalyst component, 

preferably either internally or externally of the spray nozzle, 
and the resultant sprayable filler composition is sprayed onto a 

substrate. The resulting cured coating provides a sandable 
surface which is corrosion resistant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sprayable filler
composition, and more particularly, to a high solids, low-volatiles
sprayable filler composition which may be used as a
coating on a variety of substrates, and which provides a
corrosion resistant, sandable surface.Multi-component spraying systems are widely used in the
plastics and marine industries. In such systems, a liquid resin
and a catalyst for the resin are mixed together and sprayed onto
a substrate such that the catalyst and resin react and harden on
the substrate. The mixing may be done immediately before
spraying (referred to as an internal mix system) or immediately
after spraying (referred to as an external mix system). In
either event, such coatings are referred to as a "gel coat". For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,967,956 to Mansfield discloses a "gel
coat" spraying system which uses a resin such as an epoxy resin
or a polyester resin, a catalyst for the resin, and spraying
means which includes an airless liquid nozzle. Such gel coats
utilize a slow curing process, and the coatings do not provide a
sandable surface.Another disadvantage of such gel coatings is that
application of the coatings is effected through the use of
organic solvents to reduce viscosity. Because of increased
environmental concerns about volatile organic components (VOC's),
efforts have been made to reduce the amount of volatile materials
used in such coating operations. As a result, the use of high
solids coatings has been employed to meet VOC regulations. For
example, White et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,057,555, discloses a
coating composition having a high solids content which is used as
a finish for automobiles and trucks comprising an acrylic polymer
and a catalyst. However, the coating cures very slowly. In
addition, the composition still includes from 20-60% of an
organic solvent. Further, such high solids coatings often run 
and sag when applied to vertical surfaces, and they have poor
shelf and pot life.As an alternative to using organic solvents, Bok et al, U.S.
Patent No. 5,171,613, teaches using a supercritical fluid as a
non-polluting diluent in combination with a coating mixture.
However, the method of spraying the coating requires the use of a
heated spray gun to maintain the temperature of the coating
mixture.Accordingly, there is still a need in the art for a
sprayable coating composition which may be easily applied to a
variety of substrates, cures quickly, provides a sandable
surface, and contains low volatiles.The present invention meets that need by
