<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of
antimicrobial therapy. In particular, the present invention
relates to methods and products useful in inhibiting the
growth of bacteria or other microbes. In addition, this
invention relates to identifying loci in bacteria or other
microbes which affect antibiotic or antimicrobial
susceptibility and to the production of bacterial strains
useful in the field of antimicrobial therapy.Antibiotic or antimicrobial substances have long been
used to inhibit the growth of bacteria or other microbes and
to treat bacterial or microbial infections in humans, other
animals, and in tissue culture. The use of antibiotics or
antimicrobials in a treatment regimen, however, has the
undesireable effect of selecting for bacteria or other
microbes which are resistant to those antibiotics or
antimicrobials administered or applied. As a result,
treatment regimens can be adversely affected or, in some
cases, rendered ineffective. This necessitates a continual
search for new antibiotics and antimicrobials.Of particular interest is the discovery of bacteria which
express a multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype (Mar).
This phenotype entails simultaneous resistance to a
multiplicity of antibiotics which are unrelated in chemical
structure. The appearance of such bacteria and infections by
such bacteria greatly increase the difficulty of identifying
effective antibiotics and treating infections in humans or
other animals.Multiple antibiotic resistance in bacteria is most
commonly associated with the presence of plasmids which 
contain one or more resistance genes, each encoding a single
antibiotic resistance phenotype (Clewell 1981; Foster 1983).
Multiple antibiotic resistance associated with the
chromosome, however, has also been reported in Klebsiella,
Enterobacter, Serratia (Gutmann et al. 1985), Neisseria
(Johnson and Morse 1988), and Escherichia (George and Levy
1983a).Bacteria expressing the multiple antibiotic resistance
phenotype can be isolated by selecting bacteria with a single
antibiotic and then screening for cross-resistance to
structurally unrelated antibiotics. For example, George and
Levy initially described a chromosomal multiple antibiotic
resistance system which existed in Escherichiacoli and which
could be selected by a single drug, e.g., tetracycline or
chloramphenicol (George and Levy 1983a). In addition to
resistance to the selective agents, the Mar phenotype
included resistance to structurally unrelated agents,
including nalidixic acid, rifampin,
