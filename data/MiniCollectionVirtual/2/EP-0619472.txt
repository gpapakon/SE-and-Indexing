<ABSTRACT>
A measuring device for measuring the angular speed of rotating parts, particularly of the crankshaft (10) of an internal combustion engine for motor vehicles, exhibits an encoder (16) which is rotationally rigidly connected to the V-belt pulley (12) on the crankshaft (10) and carries an angle division (17), and a pick-up (18) which is stationary relative to the rotating part and scans the angle division (17). For fast assembly involving little set-up time for engine diagnostics, the encoder (16) has a centring device (19) for positive placement on the screw head (14) of the at least one head screw (13) holding the V-belt pulley (12) on the crankshaft (10), and a fast-acting locking device (20), which nonpositively engages the V-belt pulley (12) for non-slip rotational driving. The centring device (19) and the fast-acting locking device (20) are constructed on the encoder (16) in such a manner that the latter can only become effective after centring has taken place.

Measuring device for detecting the angular
displacement of rotating parts, having a transmitter (16)

that is rotationally fixedly connected, directly or
indirectly, to the rotating part (10) and bears an angle

graduation (17), and having a pick-up (18) which is
stationary in relation to the rotating part and scans the

angle graduation (17), and in which measuring device the
transmitter (16) has a centring device (19) so that it

can be fitted in a positively-locking manner on to a
moulding that is present on the rotating part (10) itself

or on an element that is rotationally fixedly connected
thereto and is concentric with the rotating part (10),

and the transmitter (16) further has a quick-action
locking means (20), which engages in a frictional or

positive-locking manner on the rotating part itself or on
the element that is rotationally fixedly connected

thereto, in order to be driven therewith in a slip-free
manner, the centring device (19) and the quick-action

locking means (20) being constructed on the transmitter
(16) in such a way that the quick-action locking means

(20) can become effective only after centring has been
carried out, characterized in that the transmitter (16)

has an approximately plate-shaped basic body (24) and an
annular disc (26) that is fitted thereon in a manner

concentric with the basic body axis (33) and bears the
angle graduation (17), in that on the rear side of the

basic body (24), facing away from the annular disc (26),
there is arranged at least one coaxial centring part (27)

that projects therefrom at right angles, forms the
centring device (19) and is intended for fitting on to 

the at least one screw head (14) of a headed screw (13)
that is fastened to the rotating part (10) or the element

that is rotationally fixedly connected thereto, and in
that the quick-action locking means (20) is implemented

by means of permanent magnets (31), which are arranged on
the rear side of the basic body (24) in such a way that,

after centring has been carried out, they rest on the
rotating part or on the element (12) that is rotationally

fixedly connected thereto.
Measuring device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the rotating part is the crankshaft (10) of

an internal combustion engine with a V-belt pulley (12)
that is rotationally fixedly seated thereon and is

secured by means of at least one headed screw (13)
screwed into the end of the crankshaft (10).
Measuring device according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the permanent magnets (31) are arranged

offset from one another as annular segments on a pitch

circle that is concentric with the basic body axis (33),
preferably around identical circumferential means, and in

that the radius of the pitch circle and the radial width
of the permanent magnets (31) are selected such that the

permanent magnets (31) are fitted on a lateral cheek
(121) of the V-belt guide (123) on the V-belt pulley

(12).
Measuring device according to one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the permanent magnets (31)

project beyond the rear side of the basic body (24), in
that gaps (32) remain between the permanent magnets (31),

and in that the centring part (27) projects with its free
end somewhat beyond the plane (34) that is flush with the

free end faces of the permanent magnets (31).
Measuring device according to one of Claims 2 to
4, characterized in that only one headed screw (13) with

a hexagonal screw head (14) is screwed coaxially into the
crankshaft (10), and in that the centring part is

body (24) and having an internal hexagon (28) positively

locking with the hexagonal screw head (14). 
Measuring device according to one of Claims 1 to
