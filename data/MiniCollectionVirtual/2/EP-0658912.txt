<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron
source for emitting an electron beam and a process for
producing the electron source. The present invention
also relates to an image-forming apparatus such as an
image-displaying apparatus for forming an image on
irradiation of an electron beam.Two kinds of electron-emissive (hereinafter
referred to as electron-emitting) elements are
known: thermoelectron sources and cold cathode electron
sources. The cold cathode electron sources include
field emission type electron sources (hereinafter
referred to as "FE"), metal/insulator/metal type
electron sources (hereinafter referred to as "MIM"),
surface conduction electron-emitting elements, and the
like.The above FE is exemplified by the ones
disclosed by W.P. Dyke & W.W. Dolan ("Field emission":
Advance in Electron Physics, 8, 89, (1956)), C.A.
Spindt ("Physical Properties of Thin-Film Field
Emission Cathodes with Molybdenum Cones": J. Appl.
Phys, 47, 5248, (1976)), etc.The above MIM is exemplified by the ones 
disclosed by C.A. Mead ("The Tunnel-Emission
Amplifier": J. Appl. Phys., 32, 646 (1961), etc.The above surface conduction electron emitting
element is exemplified by the ones disclosed by M.I.
Elinson (Radio Eng. Electron Phys. 10, (1965)), etc.The surface conduction electron-emitting
element utilizes the phenomenon that electrons are
emitted by flowing an electric current through a thin
film formed with a small area on a substrate and in
parallel to the surface of the film. Such surface
conduction electron-emitting elements include, in
addition to the above-mentioned one disclosed by
Elinson employing an SnO2 thin film, the ones employing
an Au thin film [G. Ditter: "Thin Solid Films", 9,
317,(1972)], the ones employing In2O3/SnO2 thin film [M.
Hartwell and C.G. Fonstad: "IEEE Trans. ED Conf.", 519
(1975)], the ones employing a carbon thin film [H.
Araki et al.: Sinkuu (Vacuum), Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 22
(1983), and so forth.Typically, the surface conduction electron-emitting
element has an element constitution as shown
in Fig. 23 disclosed by M. Hartwell as mentioned above.
In Fig. 23, the numeral 231 denotes a substrate, and
the numeral 232 denotes a thin film for electron-emitting
region formation (hereinafter referred to as
"emitting region-generating thin film") composed of a
thin metal oxide film or the like formed in an H-shaped 
pattern by a sputtering process. On the thin film 232,
an electron-emitting region 233 is formed by voltage
application called a "forming" treatment as described
later. The
