<ABSTRACT>
A crosslinked olefin elastomer foam has a specific
gravity of 0.05 to 0.2, an expansion ratio of 8 to 15,

a compression set of 30 to 60% and a tear strength of
1.5 to 2.5 kg/cm. The crosslinked foam is obtained by

heating an elastomer composition comprising a specific
ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, an organic peroxide, a

crosslinking auxiliary and a foaming agent. The
crosslinked foam has a high expansion ratio, is free

from surface roughening attributed to defoaming,
realizes a soft touch, exhibits a low compression set

and is excellent in mechanical strength (particularly
tear strength) and heat resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crosslinked
olefin elastomer foam and an elastomer composition
therefor. More particularly, the present invention is
concerned with a crosslinked olefin elastomer foam
which realizes a soft touch, exhibits a low compression
set and is excellent in tear strength property and heat
resistance, and is concerned with an elastomer
composition for the crosslinked foam.A wide variety of foams are commonly produced on a
commercial scale and marketed. Foams of vulcanized
rubbers and soft olefin plastics can be mentioned as
typical examples of such foams.However, the conventional vulcanized rubbers,
although having excellent flexibility and elasticity,
inevitably require a time-consuming crosslinking or
vulcanization step for realizing these properties,
which incurs high cost. On the other hand, it is known
to use soft olefin plastics, for example, thermoplastic 
resins such as ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA)
and low-density polyethylene in the formation of foams.
These soft olefin plastics are basically inferior in
heat resistance to the vulcanized rubbers. Thus, they
encounter problems such that the applicability of
obtained foams is extremely limited and that defoaming
is likely to occur because of poor tension at melting
to thereby render the expansion ratio low, which
defoaming results in apparent surface roughening.
Further, in the use of EVA, an increase of vinyl
acetate content enhances the tear strength and
adherence thereof but deteriorates the abrasion
resistance, surface hardness and cell denseness.
Therefore, the balance of properties is difficult with
the use of EVA. Still further, the specific gravity of.
EVA itself is high, so that there occurs a problem such
that foams of desirably low specific gravity cannot
necessarily be obtained.Therefore, there is a demand for the development
of a crosslinked olefin elastomer foam which has a high
expansion ratio, is free from surface roughening
attributed to defoaming, realizes a soft touch,
exhibits a low compression set and is excellent in tear
strength property and heat resistance, and the 
development of an elastomer composition for such a
crosslinked foam.The present invention has been made with a view
toward solving the above problems of the prior art. It
is an object of the present invention to provide a
crosslinked olefin elastomer foam which has a high
expansion ratio, is free from surface roughening
attributed to defoaming, realizes a soft touch,
exhibits a low compression set and is excellent in tear
streng
