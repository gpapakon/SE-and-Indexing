<ABSTRACT>
For regulating the straight run of the conveyor belt (1), a pressure roller (7) is mounted on a shaft (8) which is pivotably mounted at a first end (7a) in the region of a first edge (1c) of the conveyor belt (1). In the region of the second edge (1d) of the conveyor belt (1), the shaft of the pressure roller (7) is connected to guiding and adjusting means (23, 15) and is guided displaceably approximately in the plane of the conveyor belt. Attached to a side plate fixedly connected to the shaft (8) are two control buttons which are covered by one arm of a conveyor-belt edge sensor (22) in the event of a lateral drift of the conveyor belt (1). The device is characterised by lower stress on the edges of the conveyor belt.
