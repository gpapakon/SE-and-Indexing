<ABSTRACT>
A corrugated pipe manufacturing apparatus provided with a roller assembly consisting of a plurality of rollers rotatable at 
an equal speed and having a plurality of projecting rings respectively, each of which rollers forming a generally helical body due 

to the projecting rings and constituting a substantially one rotary shaft, and a synthetic resin supply unit for feeding synthetic resin 
strips to the roller assembly, characterized in that the pitch, diameter and width of the projecting rings are reduced gradually in 

accordance with the coefficient of contraction of the synthetic resin strips, driven rings which can be rotated in accordance with 
peripheral speed of the outer edge portions of the projecting rings being provided in the roller valley portions between the projecting 

rings. Owing to such construction, the separation of the synthetic resin strips, which is ascribed to the contracting actions 
thereof, from the rollers and the vertical wrinkles (strain regarding the interior of the strips) which are liable to occur between the 

projecting rings and the valley portions can be prevented, and corrugated pipes having excellent molding stability, a high precision 
and a high durability can be manufactured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for producing a corrugated 
tube comprising a roller assembly composed of a plurality 
of roller means, each being provided with a plurality of 
convex rings along the axial direction thereof, and each being 
rotatable at equal speed, said roller assembly substantially 
forming a single rotating axial body so that said roller means 
are arrayed on a cylindrical surface of an imaginary cylinder, 
each axis of said roller means being inclined in a circumferential 
direction of the roller assembly, roller supporting 
means mounted axially opposite said roller assembly for rotatably 
supporting said roller means, means for continuously supplying 
a synthetic resin strip to an outer circumferential 
surface of said roller assembly from a lateral side thereof, 
and driving means for rotating said roller means at equal 
speed. An apparatus of this type is known from GB-A-2 141 670. More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus for 
producing a corrugated tube, particularly of synthetic resin, 
in which the cross-sectional shape of outer circumferential 
surface of the tube is corrugated and which exhibits sufficient 
flattening strength and expecially high molding stability 
and high durability.  
 Furthermore, various other proposals have hitherto been made 
for an apparatus for producing a corrugated tube of synthetic 
resin so that the outer circumferential surface of the tube 
has a corrugated cross-sectional profile. For example, from the above-mentioned GB-A-2 141 670 there is 
known an apparatus comprising a roller assembly made up of a 
plurality of rollers forming an imaginary cylinder, the rollers 
being each provided with a plurality of convex rings of 
the same size, and being rotated about their own axes at equal 
speed, the rollers being arranged parallel to one another so 
that the axes of the rollers are on the circumferential surface 
of the imaginary cylinder and the axial directions of 
each of the rollers being circumferentially inclined while 
being parallel to one another, a die for continuously supplying 
a strip of synthetic resin in a molten state from the 
lateral side onto the periphery of the roller assembly and a 
driving motor for continuously rotating the rollers at equal 
speed.  
 From Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-60261 (1987) there is 
also known an apparatus which further comprises a pressure roller 
profiled for meshing with the profile of the outer wall 
surface of each roller for fixing the shape of the strip of 
synthe
