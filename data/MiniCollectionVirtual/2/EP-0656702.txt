<ABSTRACT>
It has been known for a long time that radio transmissions in a common wave network place increased demands on the synchronisation of the transmitters which are interconnected to form a common wave network. The same problem arises when it is desired to transmit additional data regionally in a common wave network. So that no interference disturbances occur between the multichannel transmission signal and the additional, regionally transmitted data, it is necessary when inserting the additional data into the multichannel transmission signal to guarantee good synchronisation in terms of frequency and time in the individual transmitters. This is ensured according to the invention by providing that in each common wave transmitter which also emits additional data the time reference symbol, which is transmitted in any case, is evaluated for the purpose of temporal synchronisation of data to be inserted into the multichannel transmission signal. In addition, temporal windowing of the multichannel transmission signal provides the possibility of transmitting data, in particular control data, from a control centre to the connected transmitters. Furthermore, a frequency reference symbol is evaluated in order to improve the frequency synchronisation of the individual transmitters of the common wave network and of the multichannel transmission signal and the additional data. The method according to the invention can be applied in all common wave networks, in particular when additional data have to be synchronised with the transmission signal in terms of time and frequency.
