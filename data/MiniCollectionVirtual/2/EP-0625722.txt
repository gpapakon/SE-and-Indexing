<ABSTRACT>
An electrically-conducting substrate coated with silicon 
dioxide is contacted with alcohol vapors from a source (12) 

by heating the substrate (16) in a microwave oven. The substrate 
and source (12) of alcohol (14) are contained in a vessel (10), 

on which a vacuum is optionally pulled during the heating. The 
process results in approximately 100 fold reduction in processing 

time from the prior art time of several hours to several minutes. 
The process may be used in either inducing perpendicular 

alignment or parallel alignment of liquid crystals in the cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a treated
substrate to produce alignment of a liquid crystal on a major
surface of the substrate, the major surface being provided with
an electrically conducting layer, the process comprising the
steps of:
depositing a layer of silica on said substrate from
a source of silica;treating the silica-coated substrate with a vapor
of alcohol by heating the treated substrate; andcovering the treated substrate with a layer of liquid
crystal.  A process of the afore-mentioned kind is disclosed in
documents US-A-4 030 997 and US-A-4 022 934.One type of liquid crystal electro-optical device is
constructed by placing a thin layer of liquid crystal between
two transparent plates that have each been coated with a layer
of an electrical conductor on its interior face. When no electric
field is applied (field-OFF) between the conductive layers,
the director of the liquid crystal is in one state. (The
"director" of the liquid crystal is the macroscopic direction
of the long molecular axis of the liquid crystal molecules.)
When an electric field is applied (field-ON), the director
reorients to another state. Because the liquid crystal is
birefringent, the two states will have different refractive
indices, and in many cases the thin layer of liquid crystal
will be birefringent for light directed against the transparent
plates. The state change responsive to an applied electric field
is the basis for liquid crystal devices that control light,
such as displays and projectors.In its usual form, a liquid crystal light valve is a
device that modulates a polarized projection light beam
directed against one side of the light valve according to
a writing light beam directed against the other side. The 
polarized projection light beam enters the light valve
through one of the transparent electrodes, usually termed
the counter-electrode, passes through the liquid crystal
layer, and is reflected from a mirror on the other electrode.
The projection light beam passes back through the
liquid crystal layer and the counter-electrode, and through
an external analyzer. The polarizing and analyzing functions
can often be accomplished by a single polarizing beam
splitter through which the projection light beam passes before
and after passing through the liquid crystal. The
operation of this and other types of liquid crystal light
valves is discussed in greater detail in numerous technical
publications; see, for example, "Progress in Liquid Crystal
Light Valves", by W.P. Bleha, in Laser
