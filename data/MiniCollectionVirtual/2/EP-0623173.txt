<ABSTRACT>
Monoclonal antibodies recognizing immunoglobulin domain 4 of Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM1) are described. Such antibodies are useful, e.g., in the treatment of acute inflammation and disorders characterized by VCAM1-mediated adhesion of leukocytes and in purification methods, diagnostic methods and diagnostic kits, especially where distinguishing between the six-domain and seven-domain forms of VCAM1 is advantageous.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIBODIES RECOGNIZING THE FOURTH IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE DOMAIN OF VCAMlFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to monoclonal antibodies(MAbs) , specifically monoclonal antibodies that bind to the domain 4 of Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAMl) .BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONVCAMl (also known as INCAM-110) was first identified as an adhesion molecule induced on endothelial cells by inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-1) and LPS (Rice et al., 1989 [1]; Osborn et al., 1989 [2]). VCAMl binds to cells exhibiting the integrin VLA-4 (Î±43j) , including T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils, but not neutrophils, and is thought to participate in recruitment of these cells from the bloodstream to areas of infection and inflammation (Elices et al, 1990 [3]; Osborn, 1990 [4]). The VCAM1/VLA-4 adhesion pathway has been associated with a number of physiological and pathological processes. Although VLA-4 is normally restricted to hematopoietic lineages, it is found on melanoma cell lines, and thus it has been suggested that VCAMl may participate in metastasis of such tumors (Rice et al., 1989 [1]) . 

 In vivo, VCAMl is found on areas of arterial endothelium representing early atherosclerotic plaques in a rabbit model system (Cybulsky and Gimbrone, 1991 [5]). VCAMl is also found on follicular dendritic cells in human lymph nodes (Freed an et al. , 1990 [6]). It is also present on bone marrow stromal cells in the mouse (Miyake et al. , 1991 [7]), thus VCAMl appears to play a role in B- cell development.VCAMl belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. The major form on endothelial cells, referred to herein as VCAM-7D, has seven Ig homology units or domains; domains 4, 5 and 6 are similar in amino acid sequence to domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting an intergenic duplication event in the evolutionary history of the gene (Osborn et al. , 1989 [2]; Polte et al. 1990 [8]; Hession et al. , 1991 [9]). There is also a minor 6-domain form (referred to as VCAM-6D herein) generated by alternative splicing, in which the fourth domain is deleted (Osborn et al. , 1989 [2]; Hession et al. 1991 [9], Cybulsky et al. , 1991 [10]). The biological significance of this alternate splicing is not known, however as shown below VCAM-6D can bind VLA-4-expressing cells and thus clearly has potential functionality in vivo. The apparent involvement of the VCAM1/VLA-4 adhesion pathway in infection, inflammation and possibly atherosclerosis has led to continuing intensive research to understand the mechanisms of
