<ABSTRACT>
Bidirectional isolated interfaces using optical 
couplers offer a compact and cost-effective alternative to 

traditional line transformers. The devices can be 
configured to provide half-duplex or full-duplex 

communication. 
It is contained in a dual in-line package (DIP) (12) having eight 
pins, but any suitable packaging arrangement or device can be used. The 

optocoupler (10) comprises four devices: a first emitter (20), a second 
emitter (22), a first photodetector (24), and a second 

photodetector (26). 
The first emitter (20) is connected across DIP pins (1) and 
(2), the second emitter (22) is connected across DIP pins (7) and (8), 

the first photodetector (24) is connected across DIP pins (3) and (4), 
and the second photodetector (26) is connected across DIP pins (5) and 

(6). The optical radiation from the first and second emitters (20) and 
(22) pass through a common 

optical cavity (30). The optical cavity may be any suitable light 
 conducting medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to telephone line
communications. Specifically, the invention is directed to
coupling devices for telephone subscriber lines.The invention is related to the bidirectional coupler
of the type described US-A-5 466 944.Currently, modems employ audio/data transformers for
coupling their circuitry to telephone lines. Such a
transformer is often large and costly. In some
applications, such as the currently-popular notebook
computers, a bulky line transformer is highly undesirable.
However, a line transformer affords large bandwidth
performance which is necessary for modern operation.It would therefore be desirable to provide an
alternative to the traditional line transformer without
sacrificing frequency performance. Ideally, it would be
smaller and less expensive to manufacture. Document EP-A-0174073 describes an integrated optical and electric circuit device
in which a semiconductor light emitting device is formed in a semiconductor integrated
circuit substrate. The light emitting device emits a light signal that transmit through the
semiconductor substrate. A semiconductor light detecting device is responsive to the light
signal to bring a corresponding circuit unit into a common receiving state. Document EP-A-0084621
describes a semiconductor signal conversion device using photon coupling. In a
first region of a monolithic direct bandgap semiconductor device, an electrical input signal
is converted to photons. The photons are reconverted to an electrical output signal in a
second region of the device. Document PAJ of JP-A-5767907 describes a photoelectric
conversion connector comprising a pair of optical transmitters, a pair of optical receivers, an
optical branching filter and an optical fiber cable. Document US-A-5140152 describes a
semiconductor optoelectronic device that provides full duplex data communication over a
single optical fiber. The semiconductor device comprises a unitary P-N light emitting
portion and an N-I-P photo diode portion. The aforementioned problems are obviated by the
present invention as outlined in the claims.A more complete understanding of the present
invention, as well as other objects and advantages thereof
not enumerated herein, will become apparent upon
consideration of the following detailed description and the
accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a linear
bidirectional half-duplex optocoupler;Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of an application
incorporating the linear bidirectional half-duplex
optocoupler of

<CLAIMS>
An optocoupler (10) for simultaneous communication, comprising at least first
and second optical emitters, and at least first and second detectors
characterized in that
the first (20) and second (22) optical emitters are arranged within a single common package comprising a light
conducting medium, for emitting optical radiation, wherein the first emitter

generates optical radiation of a first wavelength and the second emitter generates
optical radiation of a second wavelength; and
the first (24) and second (26) optical detectors are arranged within the light
conducting medium, for detecting optical radiation, where the first detector

functions as a wavelength-selective filter which selects optical radiation having
the second wavelength and filters out optical radiation having the first

wavelength, where the second detector functions as a wavelength-selective filter
which selects optical radiation having the first wavelength and which filters out

optical radiation having the second wavelength, the first detector being responsive
to optical radiation emitted by the second emitter and the second detector being

responsive to optical radiation emitted by the first emitter.
An optocoupler according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
