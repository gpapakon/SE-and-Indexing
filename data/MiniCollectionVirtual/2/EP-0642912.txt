<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus according to the
introductory portion of claim 1 and to a method for coextruding
a composite stream according to the introductory portion
of claim 6.Forming a composite stream, in particular a side-by-side
composite stream, is well known. Exemplary patents include
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,348,346 to Thompson, 4,533,510 to
Nissel, 4,731,004 to Wenz, Jr., 4,784,815 to Cloeren and Wernery,
Jr., and 5,120,484 to Cloeren. Mechanically dividing a
manifold using an adjustable block, is illustrated by the
Nissel patent.Control of the degree of overlap or intermix along the
joined edges of adjacent flow streams, and control of the position
of the joined edges across the composite stream width
have been described. Particularly described are the effect of
the location selected for the convergence locus and the effect
of the relative flow volumes on control of these properties.An extrusion apparatus having deckles controlling stream
flow within the apparatus and defining the exit slot width
and hence product width, is well known. The deckles may be
internal, external, or an external/internal combination. The 
deckles may be precise or snug fitting blockage devices termed
"deckle plugs". Illustrative patents include U.S. Patent
Nos. 3,018,515 to Sneddon, 4,057,385 to Yazaki et al and
4,659,302 to Maejima et al, and UK Patent Application No.
2,114,050.However, there remains a need for an improved extrusion
apparatus capable of composite extrusion and product width
adjustment.It is accordingly an object of the present invention to
provide an improved extrusion apparatus that provides for
composite extrusion, in particular side-by-side extrusion.It is a further object to provide an extrusion apparatus
that also provides for product width adjustment.It is an even further object to provide for product
width adjustment, without affecting the degree of intermix
along joined edges of laterally converged flow streams, or
the width of a side stream in the product.It is a still further object to provide for product
width adjustment and side stream width adjustment.These objects are achieved by an apparatus according to
claim 1 and by a method according to claim 6.Additional objects, advantages and novel features of
the present invention are set forth in the description that
follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in
the art upon examination of the following description or may
be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages
of the invention may be realized
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An extrusion apparatus comprising a first flow passageway
(14) comprising a manifold (18) and a connecting

channel (20) disposed between manifold (18) and an exit orifice
(24), a slidably disposed deckle (30, 95) disposed in

first flow passageway (14), and a second flow passageway comprising
an inlet channel (48) and converging with first flow

passageway (14) characterized in that slidably disposed deckle
(30, 95) comprises a first plug portion (42) for manifold

(18) and a second plug portion (38, 96, 102) for connecting
channel (20), that first plug portion (42) extends through an

end of the extrusion apparatus into manifold (14) and comprises
a channel portion (46, 46D) which is in communication

with inlet channel (48), and that second plug portion (38,
96, 102) extends through an end of the extrusion apparatus

into connecting channel (20). 
The extrusion apparatus of claim 1, characterized
in that deckle (30, 95) further comprises a divider portion

(56, 56D), the second flow passageway further comprises a second
channel portion (54, 54D, 54E), and divider portion (56,

56D) comprises a face (34, 34D, 34E) for contacting a first
stream in the first flow passageway (14) and a face (62) for

contacting a second stream in the second channel portion (54,
54D, 54E). 
The extrusion apparatus of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the second plug portion (96, 102) is

adjustable to the first plug portion for the manifold (18).
The extrusion apparatus of claim 3, characterized
in that the second plug portion (96, 102) has an end (101,

108) for defining a width of second channel portion (54D,
54E).
The extrusion apparatus of any preceding claim,
characterized in that channel portion (46, 46D) is defined by

a generally transversely disposed recess in first plug portion
(42), and the recess extends exterior to a main body of

the extrusion apparatus, and the extrusion apparatus further
comprises a stationary member (40) comprising an inwardly

projecting portion (66) disposed in precision sliding fit
within the recess, and channel portion (46, 46D) is adjustable

in extent within the main body of the extrusion apparatus
and with respect to stationary member (40), wherein the

recess is located in an upper portion of first plug portion
(42). 
A process for coextruding a composite stream comprising
passing a first flow stream into a first passageway

(14) of an extrusion apparatus into which a slidably disposed
deckle (30, 95) extends through an end of the extrusion apparatus,

the first passageway comprising a manifold (18) and a
connecting channel (20) disposed between the manifold (18)

and an exit orifice (24), passing a second flow stream
through a second passageway comprising an inlet channel (48)

and converging the first flow stream and the second flow
stream, characterized in that prior to the converging step

the second flow stream is passed through a channel portion
(46, 46D) defined by a recess in a first plug portion (42) of

the deckle (30, 95) and disposed within the manifold (18),
the deckle (30, 95) further comprising a second plug portion

(38, 96, 102) for the connecting channel (20) extending
through an end of the extrusion apparatus into connecting

channel (20). 
The process of claim 6, characterized in that prior
to the converging

the second flow stream passes through a second channel portion
(54, 54D, 54E), that the deckle (95) further comprises a

divider portion (56, 56D) comprising a face (34, 34D, 34E)
