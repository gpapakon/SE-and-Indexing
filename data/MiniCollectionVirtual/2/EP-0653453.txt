<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing asymmetric radial polymers wherein 
the different polymeric arms are contacted sequentially with a 

coupling agent. The method narrows the relative arm distribution 
of the specifically selected asymmetric radial polymers produced 

and significantly increases the amount of tailor made final 
product having the desired ratio of polymeric arms. Coupling 

agents having four functional groups are to be used for the 
preparation of said asymmetric radial polymers, containing two 

sets of two arms of specifically selected polymer arms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing polymers. 
More particularly, this invention relates to a method for 
preparing asymmetric radial polymers of a tailor made 
specifically selected molecular structure. Heretofore, several methods have been proposed for 
preparing asymmetric radial polymers. As is well known in the 
prior art, radial polymers comprise three or more arms extending 
outwardly from a nucleus. The asymmetric radial polymers, 
generally, contain arms of at least two different polymers, which 
polymers may vary as to chemical composition, structure and/or 
molecular weights. Asymmetric radial polymers having arms of 
different molecular weights are sometimes referred to as 
polymodal polymers. A principal difference in the methods 
frequently used to prepare both asymmetric and polymodal radial 
polymers resides in the selection of a coupling agent which forms 
the nucleus of the radial polymer. The coupling agent may 
contain a fixed, though sometimes variable, number of functional 
sites such as the coupling agents taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 
3,281,383; 3,598,884; 3,639,517; 3,646,161; 3,993,613 and 
4,086,298 or the coupling agent may itself be a monomer which 
polymerizes during the coupling reaction such as taught in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,985,830. From European Patent Application No. 0314,256 has become 
known in general the preparation of asymmetrical radial 
copolymers, containing a significantly higher amount of the 
desired compound having the actual specific molecular structure, 
at the cost of earlier coproduced other accompanying molecular 
structures, by applying an alternative way of reacting the 
previously prepared individual living polymer arms with the 
polyfunctional coupling agent having from three to twelve 
funcational groups. A similar process was known from European Patent  
 
Application no. 0 540,109 A1, actually disclosing a method for 
preparing an asymmetric radial polymer, comprising subsequently 
reacting of living polymers, having a single reactive group and 
being different from each other, with a polyfunctional coupling 
agent, wherein the last polymer chain to be reacted with the 
coupling agent is contacted with the prereacted coupling agent in 
the presence of a polar compound, capable of modifying the amount 
of vinyl groups in poly(conjugated diene) polymers. In 
particular the preparation of asymmetric radial copolymers was 
disclosed, originating from the use of coupling agents having 3 
or 6 functional groups. Although the products
