<ABSTRACT>
In a process and a reactor for the production of disilane from monosilane, according to which gaseous monosilane is passed into a reaction region (5) where it is subjected to an electric discharge generated by a high frequency current (13),   a) the monosilane is used in the form of a mixture (14) with at least one inert gas chosen from the group formed by helium and argon, b) the pressure of the gaseous mixture in the reaction region is between 0.1 and 3 bars, and c) the gaseous mixture is brought into contact in the reaction region, under an electric discharge, with a wall (3) cooled to a temperature which is sufficiently low for the saturated vapour pressure of the disilane to be negligible but not sufficiently low for the monosilane to be able to condense at the partial operating pressure.

A process for producing disilane from monosilane,
according to which gaseous monosilane is passed through a

reaction zone where it is subjected to an electric discharge
produced by a high frequency current, characterized in that


a) monosilane is used in the form of a mixture with at least
one inert gas selected from the group formed of helium and

argon,
b) the pressure of the gaseous mixture in the reaction zone is
between 0.1 and 3 bar, and
c) the gaseous mixture in the reaction zone under an electric
discharge is put into contact with a wall cooled to a

temperature sufficiently low for the saturated vapour pressure
of disilane to be negligible but not so low that monosilane

can be condensed at the partial working pressure.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
pressure is 1 to 1.3 bar.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in that the
gaseous mixture contains 1 to 10 % by volume of monosilane and

90 to 99 % by volume of inert gas with a low ionization
energy.
A process according to claim 3, characterized in that the
gaseous mixture contains 4 to 8 % by volume of monosilane and

92 to 96 % by volume of inert gas.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
temperature of the cooled wall is -120°C to -145°C. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
frequency of the current producing the electric discharge is 1

to 10 kHz.
A reactor comprising a reaction chamber (5), a pipe (14)
supplying this chamber continuously with a gaseous mixture, a

pipe (16) for evacuating continuously the residual gas which
has passed through the reaction chamber, and means for

producing an electric discharge across the reaction chamber
comprising a pair of electrodes (3, 10) and a source (13) of

high frequency electric current, characterized in that the
reaction chamber is at least partially bounded by a wall (3)

which can be cooled to a very low temperature.
A reactor according to claim 7, characterized in that the
wall may be cooled to a temperature of -120°C or below.
A reactor according to claim 7, characterized in that the
reaction chamber is bounded by two concentric cylindrical

elements (3, 4), the inner cylindrical element (4) being made
of a dielectric material and being provided with metallization

(10) on its surface opposite the outer cylindrical element
(3), and the outer cylindrical element (3) being made of a

metal and being cooled externally by means of a cooling fluid.
A reactor according to claim 9, characterized in that the
outer cylindrical element (3) is also equipped with an

electrical resistance heater (7) enabling the temperature of
the cooled wall to be adjusted to a desired set value.
