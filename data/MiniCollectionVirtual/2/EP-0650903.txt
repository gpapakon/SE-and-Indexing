A cap (10) for closing the filling line (28) of the fuel 
tank of a motor vehicle, of the type comprising a 

rotating locking mechanism which cooperates with 
complementary means (98) formed on the end of the line 

(28) and which comprise at least two stops (88, 47) 
disposed axially opposite one another and between which 

is received a portion of a radial collar (98) formed on 
the end of the line (28) when the cap is in the closed 

position,
characterised in that
 the body of the cap comprises two 
parts (14, 16) assembled by elastic engagement and each 

of which comprises one of the said two axial stops (47, 
88). 
A cap according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the first part (14) of the body 
(12) of the cap comprises a locking plate (20), the lower 

face (22) of which cooperates in tight manner (104) with 
a corresponding seat (102) formed on the upper end of the 

line (28) and the lower face of which comprises a first 
axial stop (47) protrudingly formed on the said lower 

face (22), and comprises means (36) catching by elastic 
axial engagement with complementary means (92) formed on 

the second part (16) of the body (12) of the cap which is 
disposed beneath the lower face of the locking plate 

(20). 
A cap according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the first part (14) comprises an 
engaging skirt (32) which extends axially from the lower 

face (22) of the locking plate (20) and the peripheral 
surface of which comprises a radial groove (36) in which  

 
at least one engaging lug (94) formed on the second part 

(16) is received. 
A cap according to one of Claims 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 the second part (16) of the body 
(12) of the cap comprises a base (82), the upper face 

(86) of which is equipped with said complementary 
engaging means (94) and on which the second axial stop 

(88) is protrudingly formed. 
A cap according to Claim 4 taken in combination with 
Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the base (82) of the second part 
(16) has a central centring core (90) which is received 

inside (33) the engaging skirt (32) of the first part 
(14). 
A cap according to one of Claims 4 or 5,
characterised in that
 the complementary engaging means 
are formed by two diametrally opposite engaging lugs (94) 

which are received by the radial groove (36) of the 
engaging skirt (32). 
A cap according to any one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterised in that
 the second axial stop (88) is 
formed by sections of a radial collar, 


and in that
 means are provided for the rotational 
immobilisation and indexing in an angular position of the 

first part (14) in relation to the second part (16). 
A cap according to Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the indexing means comprise an 
indexing finger (56) rotationally connected to the first 

part (14) which penetrates into a recess (91) having a 
complementary profile formed in the centring core (90) of 

the second part (16).  
 
A cap according to one of Claims 7 or 8,
characterised in that
 the rotational immobilisation 
means comprise a lock, the barrel (50, 52, 56) of 

which is rotationally connected to the second part 
(16) and is mounted in a lock body (44) rotationally 

connected to the first part (14). 
A cap according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 the component (52, 54) 
emerging from the barrel (50) is fixed axially to 

the second part (16, 19) by elastic engagement (92, 
54). 
A cap according to Claim 10 taken in combination 
with Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the central core (90) of the 
second part (16) comprises at least one engaging 

finger (92) which is received in an inner radial 
groove (64) formed in the component (52) emerging 

from the barrel (50) of the lock. 
A cap according to any one of Claims 9 to 11,
characterised in that
 the body (44) of the lock is 
formed by a skirt extending axially from the upper 

face (46) of the locking plate (20) of the first 
part (14). 
A cap according to any one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 it comprises a covering lid 
(18). 
A cap according to Claim 13 taken in combination 
with any one of Claims 2 to 12,
characterised in that
 the lid (18) is fixed onto the 
locking plate (20) by elastic engagement (30, 80).
