<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (20) used to interface a peripheral device (22) to a computer (24) has an adapter card (26) that plugs into the computer (24) and a smart cable (28) that plugs into the adaptor card (26) at one end and the peripheral device (22) at the other. The adapter card (26) includes a reconfigureable interface circuit (30) that is in communication with the computer (24) when the adapter card (26) is connected to the computer (24). The smart cable (28) includes a first memory (32) containing configuration information for the reconfigureable interface circuit (30), and a second memory (34) containing adapter card information structure information for the reconfigureable interface circuit (30). The two memories are accessible by the reconfigureable interface circuit (30) when the smart cable (28) is connected to the adapter card (26). The smart cable (28) further includes a peripheral device interface circuit (36) communicating with the reconfigureable interface circuit (30) and with the peripheral device (22) when the smart cable (28) is connected to the adapter card (26) and the peripheral device (22) is connected to the smart cable (28). Connectors between the computer (24) and the adaptor card (26), the adapter card (26) and the smart cable (28), and the smart cable (28) and the peripheral device (22) are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionReconfigureable Interface Between A Computer and Peripheral DevicesTechnical FieldThis invention relates to computer systems, 5 and, more particularly, to the connection of peripheral devices to computers.Background ArtOne of the important features of computers is their ability to connect to, exchange information with, and control (and be controlled by) various10 accessories. In some cases, accessories are internal to the computer. In other cases, due to size or other requirements, the accessories are external to the computer, and are termed "peripheral devices" .15 In the conventional approach for interfacing a portable computer to a peripheral device, a special-purpose PCMCIA card plugs into the computer. The interface may be split into two portions, the PCMCIA card itself and an outboard20 assembly, commonly termed a "dongle". The PCMCIA card contains a portion of the electronics required to interface the computer to the peripheral device, as well as the logic required to create an intermediate bus-like interface to communicate 5 between the PCMCIA card and the dongle. The remaining interface electronics, as well as the interface to the intermediate bus, are placed in the dongle. The outboard assembly is usually in the form of a cable that plugs into the PCMCIA card at 0 one end and the peripheral device at the other end. The PCMCIA card and the outboard assembly cable are special-purpose devices useful only with the peripheral device for which they are designed.When the computer user wishes to add a 

 ne peripheral device to the capability of th computer, the PCMCIA card and the outboard assembl cable are purchased along with the other structur and software of the peripheral device. In som 5 instances, such as the modem, the cost of th dedicated PCMCIA card and the outboard assembl cable can constitute a significant portion of th total cost of the peripheral device. When th computer user adds another peripheral device to th10 computer capability, a separate dedicated PCMCI card and outboard assembly cable specific to tha device are purchased.The present inventor has recognized a nee for an improved approach to interfacing peripheral15 devices to computers, particularly portabl computers. Such an interfacing approach woul desirably reduce the cost of interfacing various types of peripheral devices to the computer, while managing the power requirements for the peripheral20 devices and the computer. The present invention fulfills this need, and further provides related
