<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the fatigue strength of the bottom (80) of the groove (8) lying axially between two treads (1A) (1B) of the same tyre P, and lying radially on top of a connecting rod (7) axially located in the equatorial plane XX' of the tyre P, and below which the carcase reinforcement (10) passes, the said groove (8) has a given meridional configuration in combination with the radial position of the centre of gravity G of the reinforcing rod (7).

A tyre comprising at least two treads (1A and 
1B) which are spaced axially from one another by a 

connecting region (6) comprising a groove (8) and, at 
its centre, a reinforcement bead wire (7) of radius R
T
 
less than that of the treads (1A) and (1B) and radially 

on the inside of which a radial carcass reinforcement 
(10) passes which is anchored in each bead (4A, 4B) to 

at least one anchoring bead wire (5A, 5B), said 
reinforcement (10) being radially surmounted by at 

least one crown reinforcement formed of at least two 
plies of cords or cables inclined by an angle of 

between 10° and 50° with respect to the circumferential 
direction and reinforcing the treads (1A) (1B) of width 

L, characterised in that: 

the connecting groove (8) between the two 
treads (1A) and (1B) has a width l, measured at the 

level of the tread surfaces, of between 0.1 and 0.25 
times the total width 2L of the treads (1A), (1B), a 

depth h at least equal to 0.6(R
S
 - R
E
) and walls (81A), 
(81B) inclined with respect to a perpendicular N to the 

travel surface by an angle α of between 15° and 25°, 
these two walls (81A) and (81B) being connected 

radially on the inner side by a cylindrical portion 
(80) tangent to said walls, and in that: 
the radius R
T
 of the centre of gravity G of the 
transverse section of the reinforcement bead wire (7) 

is at least equal to 
R
E
 + 0.1(R
S
 - R
E
)
, R
S
 being the 
radius of the points S of the carcass reinforcement 

(10) furthest from the axis of rotation of the tyre, 
and R
E
 being the radius of the points E of the carcass 
reinforcement (10) furthest axially from the equatorial 

plane XX' of the tyre. 
A tyre according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the layer of vulcanised rubber (14) forming the  

 
groove bottom (80) and located radially above the bead 

wire (7) is reinforced by at least one ply of cables 
(13), this ply being located radially substantially at 

the centre of the layer (14). 
A tyre according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the reinforcement ply of the layer (14) is one of 

the continuous plies (11A) (11B) (11C) of the crown 
reinforcement (2), the other plies (11A, 11B, 11C, 

etc.) of said reinforcement (2) being axially 
discontinuous and forming blocks (2A, 2B) separately 

reinforcing the treads (1A, 1B). 
A tyre according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that it comprises two distinct crown reinforcements 

(2A, 2B) on opposite sides of the central groove (8), 
the reinforcement ply (13) of the layer (14) being 

independent of the crown reinforcements (2A) and (2B) 
and having an axial width λ substantially equal to the 

axial width of the bottom of the groove (8). 
A tyre according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that it comprises two distinct crown reinforcements 

(2A, 2B) on opposite sides of the central groove (8), 
the reinforcement ply (13) of the layer (14) being 

independent of the crown reinforcements (2A, 2B) and 
having an axial width such that its axial edges are 

juxtaposed radially with the axially inner edges of the 
crown reinforcements (2A) and (2B), respectively. 
A tyre according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that at least one ply of cords or 

cables (12) is arranged radially between the 
reinforcement bead wire (7) and the carcass 

reinforcement (10). 
A tyre according to Claim 6, characterised in 

that the ply which is arranged radially on the inside 
of the bead wire (7) is one of the continuous plies 

(11A), (11B), (11C) of the crown reinforcement (2), the 
other plies (11A, 11B, 11C etc.) of said reinforcement  

 
(2) being axially discontinuous and forming blocks (2A, 

2B) which separately reinforce the treads (1A, 1B). 
A tyre according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that it comprises two distinct crown reinforcements 

(2A, 2B) on opposite sides of the central groove (8), 
the reinforcement ply (12) arranged radially to the 

inside of the bead wire (7) being independent of the 
crown reinforcements (2A) and (2B) and its ends being 

axially spaced by an amount λ' substantially equivalent 
to the axial width l of the groove bottom (8). 
A tyre according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that it comprises two distinct crown reinforcements 

(2A, 2B) located on opposite sides of the central 
groove (8), the reinforcement ply (12) arranged 

radially to the inside of the bead wire (7) being 
independent of the crown reinforcements (2A, 2B) and 

having an axial width such that its axial edges are 
juxtaposed radially with the axially inner edges 

respectively of the reinforcements (2A) and (2B).
