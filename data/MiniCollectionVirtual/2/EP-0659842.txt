pigment and a dioxazine pigment derivative represented in the 

form of a free acid by the following formula (I); 

wherein R₁ and R₂ each independently represents a substituted 
or unsubstituted and saturated or unsaturated aliphatic 

hydrocarbon group or aromatic hydrocarbon group, or R₁ and R₂ 
form a heterocyclic ring; L is an integer of 1-6; m is a 

number of 0.5-3; and n is a number of 0.5-3.5 provided that 
total of m and n is 1-5; and

 
the pigment composition can be used with excellent pigment 

characteristics for various uses, and particularly, when they 
are used for paints or printing inks in the form of non-aqueous 

dispersion system, the dispersion system has lower 
dispersion viscosity and exhibits good flowability and there 

occurs no color segregation in the dispersion system and it 
has high coloring power and gives good prints or coats having 

good gloss and high transparency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pigment 
compositions. In non-aqueous dispersion system such as paints and 
printing inks, pigments sometimes flocculate to bring about 
various problems such as sedimentation, increase in viscosity, 
decrease in coloring power and color segregation when mixed 
with other pigments. For solving these problems caused by 
decrease in flowability and in non-flocculation properties, 
many proposals have been made mainly on phthalocyanine and 
quinacridone pigments. For example, JP-B-41-2466 ("JP-B-" 
means Japanese Examined Patent Publication, i.e. Kokoku), JP-B-50-4019 
disclose incorporation of sulfonation products or 
metal salts of pigments, JP-B-38-2713 and JP-B-39-16787 
disclose incorporation of substituted amino methyl compounds 
and USP 2761868 and JP-A-55-108466 ("JP-A-" means Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication, i.e. Kokai) disclose 
incorporation of phthalimide methyl compounds. However, although, according to these known 
processes, the non-flocculation properties can be improved to 
some extent, color segregation still occurs much when mixed 
with white pigments and satisfactory results have not yet been 
obtained. Furthermore, JP-A-1-213366 and JP-B-1-34268 disclose 
pigment compounds for solving these defects. However, these 
pigment compounds are still insufficient and it is strongly 
desired to develop a method for solving these various problems  
 
caused by decrease in flowability and in non-flocculation 
properties etc. effectively from industrial view points. The inventors of the present invention have studied 
for solving these problems and, as the result, found novel 
dioxazine pigment derivatives and attained the present 
invention. The present invention provides a pigment composition 
which comprises an organic pigment and a dioxazine pigment 
derivative represented in the form of a free acid by the 
following formula (I); 
wherein R₁ and R₂ each independently represents a substituted 
or unsubstituted and saturated or unsaturated aliphatic 
hydrocarbon group having 1-20 carbon atoms or aromatic 
hydrocarbon group, or R₁ and R₂, together with the adjacent 
nitrogen atom, form a heterocyclic ring which may further 
contain a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atom; L is an integer of 
1-6; m is a number of 0.5-3; and n is a number of 0.5-3.5 
provided that total of m and n is 1-5. Examples of the aliphatic hydrocarbon group 
represented by R₁ or R₂ include an alkyl group, an alkenyl 
group and an alkynyl group. Preferred substitutents are 
hydroxy, aryl
