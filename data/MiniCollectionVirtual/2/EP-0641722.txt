<ABSTRACT>
Portioning arrangement for dispensing portions of liquid foodstuff 
(2) from a foodstuff container, where the portioning device exhibits 

a portioning housing which exhibits a holding part (7) and a 
portioning device (8) attachable to this in such a way that the 

holding part (7) and the portioning device (8) together form a 
portioning chamber (9) and where the portioning device (8) is 

arranged to allow foodstuff (2) to be drawn by suction out of the 
foodstuff container and into the portioning chamber (9) and 

dispensed from it, principally on to food such as a hamburger or the 
like. In order to be able to quickly and effectively clean this 

portioning arrangement (1) internally by dismantling only a small 
number of parts without tools, the portioning device (8) is designed 

as a bung-like part (24) which is intended to be inserted into a 
space (23) intended for the purpose in the holding part (7) so that 

the bung-like part (24) plugs with a seal and sits securely in 
said space (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dispensing device with
portioning arrangement for dispensing portions of liquid
foodstuff from a foodstuff container, the liquid foodstuff
consisting principally of a dressing containing coarse,
solid constituents such as, for example, pieces of vegetable,
in which the portioning arrangement exhibits a portioning
housing comprising a holding part through which
the portioning housing is mounted on the outer container,
and a portioning device arranged in such a way on the holding
part that the holding part and the portioning device
together form a portioning chamber, where the portioning
chamber has an inlet opening and an outlet opening, where
a non-return valve is provided at the inlet opening to
prevent return flow of foodstuff from the portioning chamber
to the foodstuff container and another non-return
valve is provided at the outlet opening to prevent flow
of foodstuff and/or air into the portioning chamber, and
where the portioning device is designed as a bung-like
part which exhibits an elastic fixing part, an elastic
end wall and two elastic tongues. Portioning arrangements of the above type are already known from e.g.
EP, A2, 0 144 879, but they are not intended for dispensing foodstuff
and there is therefore no need for quick dismantling and cleaning thereof
after daily use, which for hygienic reasons is an absolute requirement
when dispensing foodstuff.The purpose of the present invention is to eliminate this drawback and
achieve a portioning arrangement with a small number of parts to be dismantled,
cleaned and re-assembled and where this can be done with
simple manual actions. This is achieved according to the invention mainly
with the aid of the characteristics that appear from the following claim 1.Since the fixing part of the bung-like part can be located in an inner space
in the holding part so that it engages inner walls in said space, the holding
part and the bung-like part can be sized or dimensioned such that
they are easy to dismantle for individual cleaning and thereafter as easy
to reassemble. Despite this dimensioning of the holding part and the
bung-like part, it is easy to ensure that the sealing pressure between said
parts momentarily increases during dispensation in order to withstand
or better withstand the inner pressure thereby generated, namely by
bringing the fixing part to strive to date or expand in radial direction towards
the inner walls when the bung-like part is stressed or influenced
by the operating device.Preferred embodiments

(23) in such a way that foodstuff (2) can enter the fixing

part (25) and up to the end wall (27), which is operable
so as to be subject to portioning motions (PR) in order

to produce negative pressure in the portioning chamber (9)
and thereby draw in foodstuff (2) by suction into it and

to achieve a positive pressure in the portioning chamber
(9) and thus dispense foodstuff (2) from it.
Dispensing device according to any one of the above
claims, 
characterized in
 that the bung-like
part (24) is insertable in the space (23) only if

the bung-like part (24) has a definite position relative

to press foodstuff (2) out of the portioning chamber (9)
and that the end wall (27) exhibits a shape and elasticity

such that, from a pressed-in position (IL), it
returns automatically to the normal shape (NF) and on

this motion draws foodstuff (2) by suction from the foodstuff

characterized
in
 that the wall thickness of the end
wall (27) increases from central parts thereof in the

direction radially outwards towards outer parts thereof
