<ABSTRACT>
The inverter stage according to the invention is particularly suitable for forming a ring oscillator, the high output frequency of which can be varied within wide limits. This is made possible by the fact that the load resistor in previously used inverter stages for ring oscillators is replaced by two diodes. As a result, the operating resistance determining the delay time is dependent on the switching current, the voltage gain and the signal deviation of the inverter remaining independent of the switching current.

<CLAIMS>
Ring oscillator having a number of at least 3
series-connected invertor stages, the output of the last

invertor stage being connected to the input of the first
invertor stage,

characterized

in that each invertor stage has an npn transistor (11;
19; 24), whose base terminal forms the input of the

invertor stage, and whose collector terminal forms the
output of the invertor stage,
in that a series circuit formed by at least two diodes
(7, 8; 17, 18; 22, 23) is provided between a supply

voltage terminal (1) and the collector terminal in each
invertor stage, and
in that the emitters of all the npn transistors are
connected to one another and are connected via a controllable

current source (13) to a reference-earth potential.
