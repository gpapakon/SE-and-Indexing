<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing ingestible compositions to be used as 
contrast enhancing agents in NMR imaging of the digestive tract of 

humans and animals is disclosed. The compositions comprising 
magnetite particles bound to a carrier phase consisting of a water-insoluble 

mineral or organic substrate, are produced through selection of 
a coupler with at least two reactive functions. One of said reactive 

functions of the coupler is grafted to the particles and the other of said 
reactive functions is attached to said carrier phase thus binding said 

particles to the carrier phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method of manufacturing
innocuous ingestible or enterally administrable compositions which are
used as contrast media in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
the gastro-intestinal tract of animal and human patients.It is well known that MRI enables the direct electronic visualization
of internal organs in living beings and is therefore powerful help and
guide in prognosis, medical treatment and surgery. This technique can
often advantageously supplement or replace X-ray tomography as well as
the use of radio-active tracer compounds which may have obvious
undesirable side-effects.It is also known that MRI techniques comprise subjecting a patient
to a main static magnetic field combined with a linear gradient magnetic
field, both being directed to some parts of the body to be investigated. The
magnetic fields act on the nuclei of atoms with fractional spin quantum
numbers and encode them into various degrees of statistical alignment
with different resonant frequencies in a selected direction of orientation;
the nuclei of concern here are mainly that of hydrogen atoms, i.e.
protons, these being predominantly that of molecules present in
relatively high concentration in or around the organs to be investigated,
viz, the protons of water and lipids. For doing the measurements, one
will apply to the parts of the body under investigation pulses of radiofrequency
that matches with the resonance energy of the protons
involved in the tissues or fluids of said parts of the body. When the
protons under consideration are excited by a pulse of resonant energy,
they are raised to a higher energy state which causes them to flip from
the average orientation direction controlled by the magnetic field.
Thereafter, the protons will return to their original state by relaxation in
an exponential time dependent fashion, the corresponding energy then
reemitted (spin-echo) forming a response signal typical of the protons
under consideration, i.e. depending on their immediate environment. MRI techniques are actually based on the detecting, acquiring and
electronically processing of this signal (according to Fourier transforms)
and thereafter displaying it spatially on a screen, thus forming an image
whose various patterns correspond to areas having protons in different
environments, i.e. to protons belonging to organ tissues or body fluids
being subjected to investigation.Among the critical factors pertaining to MRI, one usually
distinguishes two mutually perpendicular components of the

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing ingestible compositions to be
used as contrast agents in NMR imaging of the digestive tract of

humans and animals, said compositions comprising magnetite
particles bound to a carrier phase, 
characterized in
 selecting as said
carrier phase a water-insoluble, hydrophilic water-swelling, mineral

or organic substrate, selecting a coupler with at least two reactive
functions, grafting the coupler to the particles through one of said

reactive functions and binding said grafted particles to said carrier
phase through the other of said reactive functions.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of
selecting, as the carrier phase, a copolymer of acrylic acid, said acrylic

acid being copolymerized in the presence of said grafted particles,
said other reactive function of the coupler having a double bond

copolymerizing with acrylic acid.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of
selecting, as said one function of the coupler, a trialkoxy-silane

function whereby the coupler binds to the magnetite particles
through formation of a silicon-containing bond.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of
selecting, as additional carriers, polymers having carboxy, sulfate,

sulfonate, phosphate and phosphonate groups free or in the form of
alkali- or alkaline-earth metal salts.
The method of claim 4, the additional carriers comprising
polysulfated or polyphosphonated carbohydrate polymers.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of
selecting, as additional carriers, one or more of magnesium alginate,

pectin, hydroxylated coatable polysaccharides or Attapulgite and/or
Montmorillonite clays. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of
dispersing the contrast particles in an aqueous solution of one or

more water-soluble polymer carrier, the amount of said particles to
said water-soluble polymer carrier, measured dry, not exceeding 5%

by wt.
The method of claim 7, whereby the proportion of said
dispersions is up to 99% of the total of the compositions and the

water-soluble polymer carrier is selected from dextran, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone
(PVP), carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), hydroxypropylcellulose

and other water-soluble non-metabolizable polymers.
