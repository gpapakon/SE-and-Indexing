<ABSTRACT>
Tube heat exchanger provided with heat exchanging surface formed by uniform slender helical heat exchanging tubes (1) that are oriented in tube plates equally or alternately in two azimuths forming an angle (G) lower than 180 DEG  and having their contour diameter (DE) greater than their pitch (T) in tube plates. Therefore, in case of the corresponding helix led in the heat exchanging surface numerous uniformly situated contact spots are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Tube Heat Exchanger and a Method of Production of its Heat Exchanging ElementsField of the InventionThe invention relates to a heat exchanging apparatus sub¬ stantially consisting of a tube heat exchanging surface, tube plates, a shell, usually of the cylindrical shape, bottoms at the ends and the appropriate input and output nozzles situated in the bottoms and in the shell.State of the ArtThe already disclosed tube heat exchangers are provided with a heat exchanging surface made most often from straight heat exchanging tubes, eventually from traditional helically wound tubes situated alternately in right-handed and left-handed coaxial cylindrical layers. The heat exchanging tubes having their ends fastened in the tube plates are mounted in the support and distance design elements that may be considered from the hydraulic and thermal points of view as passive elements. The existence of such elements as well as of the simultaneously used various hydraulic partitions in the most commonly used heat exchangers with straight heat exchanging tubes is a design, production and operational disadvantage of the existing tube heat exchangers.Summary of the InventionThe above mentioned disadvantage of the disclosed technical solutions is removed by the presented invention which isSUBSTITUTESHEETISA/EP 

based on a new geometry ' of the heat exchanging elements an which consists substantially in that the heat exchangin surface of the heat exchanger is formed by slende right-handed and/or left-handed helical heat exchangin tubes that are preferably identical. The tubes are oriente in the tube plates equally or alternately and ar mutually turned a little bit. It is preferable if the eve or odd tubes are turned by the same angle that is belo 180°. At the same time their external or contour diameter i bigger than their pitch in the tube plates. Thereby, i case of the appropriate helix lead numerous uniformly space contact spots are established in the heat exchanging surfac and significant hydraulic and heat exchanging intensifica tion effects are observed. The frequency of the contac points and the magnitude of the intensification effects ar proportional also to the spatial curvature of the helica heat exchanging tubes.Progressiveness of the presented tube heat exchanger desig is given by its main advantages. The new heat exchangin surface is self-supporting, eliminates the vibration possi bility of the individual heat exchanging tubes. Thereby their service life and reliability of their attachment t the tube plates with

Abstract
Title of the Invention:
Tube Heat Exchanger and a Method of its Heat Exchangin Elements Production
The presented tube heat exchanger is provided with hea exchanging surface formed by uniform slender helical hea exchanging tubes (1) that are oriented in tube plate equally or alternately in two azimuths forming an angle (G lower then 180°. Their contour diameter (D
E
) is greater the their pitch (T) in tube plates. Therefore, in case of th corresponding helix led in the heat exchanging surfac numerous uniformly situated contact spots are formed. There fore, the new heat exchanging surface is self-supported prevents vibrations of individual elements, has greate service life, provides substantially increased specific hea output, is less fouling by impurities from the media an makes realization of a number of design modification including the high compact ones possible. The respectiv heat exchangers are smaller, lighter and therefore als cheaper in comparison to the traditional tube hea exchangers. An alternative advantage consists in th possibility to transfer heat at lower temperature differenc what leads to the increase of thermal effectiveness in th relevant thermal circle and to the corresponding fue savings. The industrial application possibilities ar enormously broad as it concerns also thermal circles o energy producing systems operating at high temperature Oand/or pressures of heat transfer media where also pha
