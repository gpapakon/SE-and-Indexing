<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS THEREFOR FIELD OF THE INVENTIONMethod of treating and preventing irritable bowel syndrome employing combination therapy using an anion- binding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer. Pharmaceutical compositions, consisting essentially of an anion-binding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer, which are effective for treating and preventing the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART This invention relates to a method and means for treating or preventing irritable bowel syndrome with a combination of polymeric substances or materials comprising as essential components an anion-binding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer. Irritable bowel syndrome is a complex of gastrointestinal symptoms manifested by abdominal pain and distention and by altered bowel habits. It is the most common symptom complex encountered by gastroenterologists and may account for 50% of outpatient gastroenterological complaints. There are no known organic causes for the disease, and it is frequently associated with stress and emotional disturbance. Irritable bowel syndrome occurs most frequently in the age group from 20 to 50 years old and occurs two to five times more frequently in females than in males. This painful disease is prevalent in 

approximately 20% of the adult population of the USA. The consequences of the disease can be socially debilitating and induce severe sexual dysfunction in many patients, especially females. Although not life threatening, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a major health problem from the standpoint of decreased quality of life and reduction of productivity.There is presently no effective treatment for irrita¬ ble bowel syndrome (K.B. Klein, Controlled treatment trials in the irritable bowel syndrome: a critique, Gastroenter- ology £5: 232-241, 1988). Although largely ineffective, current treatment is multifactorial and consists of stress management, diet, and drugs, in that order. The patient is reassured that the disease is not life threatening and is advised to reduce or eliminate any controllable stress in his or her life. Relaxation exercises and biofeedback may be attempted to alter the psychogenic components of the illness. With respect to diet, the patient is advised to avoid any food to which he or she possesses a known sensitivity with respect to exacerbating the problem. A high fiber diet, either insoluble wheat bran or soluble psyllium, is almost routinely
