<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for the coding and efficient display of 
overlapping windows with transparency is disclosed. Each pixel within a window 

which is not to be displayed may be coded as a "transparent" pixel. The disclosed 
method identifies those pixels which have been coded as transparent and displays 

non-transparent pixels contained in windows of lower display priority in place of the 
transparent pixels contained in windows of higher display priority. A pixel coded as 

transparent may have associated with it an integer representative of the number of 
successive pixels in the window which are also transparent. A pixel may be coded as 

transparent by assigning to it a preselected data value which is distinct from values 
otherwise used to indicate, e.g., the color and/or intensity for each displayed pixel. 

The disclosed method and apparatus may include one or more windows which 
contain full motion video (i.e., television) images, each of which may also contain 

transparent pixels. A pixel also may be coded as a "translucent" pixel, whereby a 
combination of the translucent pixel and a non-translucent pixel contained in a 

window of lower display priority is displayed. The disclosed method may be used to 
efficiently recognize various conditions in the displayed image, including the 

collision of objects and the pointing of a displayed cursor to identified "hot spots."

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to video display systems and 
more specifically to display systems in which a plurality of independent, overlapping 
windows of display data may be simultaneously displayed. Computer terminal and digital television display systems commonly 
employ a technique known as "bitmapped" graphics. A "bitmap" is a storage array 
of bits ("1s" and "0s") corresponding to the intensity and/or color pattern to be 
displayed at the various locations on a display screen. A display system uses these 
bits to properly modulate the electron beam of the cathode ray tube, thereby 
displaying a desired image. Most commonly, these bits are stored in memory as an 
array, ordered in a left to right sequence within a top to bottom sequence (sometimes 
referred to as a raster scan order). As the display screen is scanned by the electron 
beam one horizontal line at a time from top to bottom (and from left to right within 
each horizontal scan line), the bitmap data can be readily accessed sequentially. 
Changes in the displayed image are accomplished by changing the data in the 
bitmap. The display system then displays changed data on subsequent scans of the 
display device. Display systems in which a plurality of independent sets of information 
are displayed concurrently on one display device, each set in its own individual 
"window," are well known. In the case of computer-based video display systems, 
each set of information (i.e., the contents of each window) is often associated with an 
individual program executing in a multi-tasking computer system. Thus, a computer 
user can simultaneously execute multiple applications and may view the activity of, 
or otherwise interact with, each of these programs concurrently. In television 
systems, one or more of the windows may contain video image displays. For 
example, several such television pictures may be "tiled" on a single television 
screen, allowing the viewer to watch two or more programs concurrently. In both the computer display and television examples each window may 
be independently located within the overall display area. Information to be 
displayed in each of the windows typically consists of a set of information elements 
(pixels) arranged in a field of arbitrary, rectangular dimensions. Furthermore, the 
information in each such window may be either periodically or continually updated.  
 
whereupon the display system re-displays the updated information as necessary. 
This re-display is achieved by the repetitive scanning
