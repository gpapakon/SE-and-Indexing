<ABSTRACT>
The increase in the speed of watercraft requires overproportional propulsive outputs, since the frictional force of the water increases exponentially with the speed. Known methods attempt to circumvent these facts by reducing the wetted area (hydrofoil) or utilizing the lower frictional force of the air (hovercraft), which, however, is only partly successful with complicated special constructions, which in addition are sensitive to a swell. The method according to the invention and an arrangement for carrying it out are intended to prevent the overproportional increase in the water friction while maintaining to the greatest possible extent the hull shape typical of skimmers. The kinetic energy of the output thrust jet of water jet propulsion, by injection of air according to the Venturi principle, is used to substantially reduce the frictional force exerted on the planing bottom 1 by the oncoming water 2. At least one device 3, arranged in or on a planing bottom 1, for carrying out the method is provided with a nozzle 9 from which jet water 15 discharges which draws in air fed to the nozzle orifice 11 through openings 6 in the planing bottom 1 and forces a friction-reducing air/water mixture 16 between oncoming water 2 and planing bottom 1. The jet water 15 can at the same time deliver the thrust for the propulsion of the watercraft.
