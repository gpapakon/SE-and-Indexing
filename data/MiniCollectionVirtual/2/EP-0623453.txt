<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing pumping devices, 
particularly usable in sports shoes, including the 

monolithic molding of a body (3) having at least one 
tubular passage (4) and a first (10) and a second (14) seat 

for air venting and intake valves. The body furthermore 
includes at least one chamber (6) with a partially open 

elastically deformable wall (7). The method entails the 
closure of the chamber, whereas the valves and at least one 

inflatable plenum chamber (2) are associable within the 
body thus obtained, before closing it. The pumping device 

thus obtained has optimum functional characteristics as 
well as very low manufacturing costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method for manufacturing a pumping device, particularly for
sports shoes and to
a pumping device.The use of pumping devices has currently been extended
to sports shoes for athletic activities and the like.Accordingly, the problem regarding the need to achieve
optimum fit and securing of the foot inside the shoe by
virtue of pneumatic systems is currently strongly felt.On this subject, US Patent 4,232,459 granted November
11, 1980 discloses a closure device for ski boots that
comprises a plenum-chamber element that can be arranged
between the shell and the innerboot of the ski boot and is
connected to pumping means included in the ski boots; this
device has the particularity of connecting the pumping
means to the plenum-chamber element by means of an air
delivery duct; air venting means, connected to the plenum-chamber
element, are also provided.Although this solution is undoubtedly valid, it has
been observed that it has high industrialization costs due
to the presence of separate ducts and to the need to apply
valves for the operation of the device.Further pumping devices of this type are described in documents
EP-A-0 229 273 and US-A-3 664 043.A principal aim of the present invention is therefore
to solve the described technical problems by eliminating
the drawbacks of the prior art and thus providing a method
that allows to manufacture, with low industrial costs,
pumping elements that can be used to improve fit in sports 
shoes.Within the scope of the above aim, an important object
is to provide a method that allows to obtain pumping
devices at a low cost.Another important object is to provide a method that
allows to obtain pumping devices which are reliable and
safe in use.According to the invention, there is provided a
method for obtaining pumping devices, particularly for
sports shoes, the method comprising
at least one first step for the monolithic molding of a
body that includes at least one tubular passage, a first
and a second seat for air venting and intake valves, and at
least one chamber with a partially open elastically
deformable wall, and said method further comprising at least one second
step for the closure of said at least one chamber, preferably
after the placement of one or more of said valves.Further, according to the invention, a pumping device
comprising a body which is formed by monolithic
molding is provided, said body being preferably made of
elastically deformable plastic material and said body comprises at
least one tubular passage,

<CLAIMS>
Method for manufacturing a pumping device,
particularly for sports shoes, the method

comprising at least one first step for the monolithic
molding of a body (3) that includes at least one tubular

passage (4), a first seat (10) and a second seat (14) for air
venting and intake valves, and at least one chamber (6)

with a partially open elastically deformable wall (7), and said
method further comprising at least one second step for the closure

of said at least one chamber (6), preferably after the placement
of one or more of said valves. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that
it entails, after formation of said body (3), the insertion of

a one-way valve (18) through an opening (19) formed between
a ridge (9) and a bottom (8) of said body (3).
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that
during said second step said opening (19) is closed by

hermetically joining together said ridge (9) and partially
said bottom (8), so as to cause said chamber (6) to have said

one-way valve (18) and said air intake valve (15) as its only
external connections. 
A pumping device comprising a body (3) which is
formed by monolithic molding, said body (3) being preferably

made of elastically deformable plastic material and
said body (3)

comprising at least one tubular passage (4), preferably
constituted by a hollow cylindrical element, which passage (4) is

hermetically connected to at least one inflatable plenum
chamber (2) at one end and is integrally joined, at its

other end, by means of at least one duct (5), to at least
one chamber (6) that has at least one elastically

deformable wall (7) arranged opposite a bottom (8), said
chamber (6) being partially open, in that said bottom (8) is not

connected, approximately opposite said tubular passage (4), to
a ridge (9) which lies along the perimeter of said chamber (6).
The pumping device of claim 4, characterized in
that at least one first seat (10) for an air venting valve

is formed at said tubular passage (4), and in that said valve
can be activated by the user by pressing.
The pumping device of claim 5, characterized in
that said first seat (10) protrudes preferably radially with 

respect to said tubular passage (4), a covering element (12)
being advantageously associable with said first seat (10), said

covering element (12) being constituted by a plug made of
elastically deformable material which is preferably

associated, by means of a tongue (13), with said tubular
passage (4) outside said first seat (10).
The pumping device according to any one or more of
the preceding claims 4 to 6, characterized in that a second

seat (14) is formed on said body (3), preferably in a region
which is adjacent to said duct (5), and connects said

chamber (6) to the outside, said second seat (14) allowing to
accommodate a valve (15) for introducing air into said

chamber (6).
The pumping device of claim 7, characterized in
that a recess (16) for the placement of an end of said air

intake valve (15) is formed on said ridge (9) to allow the
locking of one end of said valve (15), which is locked in its

position by a pair of protrusions (17) that rise at right
angles with respect to said ridge (9) at said recess (16) opposite

said second seat (14).
The pumping device according to any one or more of
the preceding claims 4 to 8, further comprising a one-way

valve (18) which can be accommodated at said duct (5) and is
suitable to allow air to flow from said chamber (6) to said

tubular passage (4) but not vice versa.
