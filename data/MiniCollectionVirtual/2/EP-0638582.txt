<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
process for producing a
powdery molybdenum
oxysulfide dithiocarbamate composition and
a grease composition containing the composition. More specifically, the
present invention relates to a
process for producing a
powdery molybdenum oxysulfide
dithiocarbamate composition which exhibits low corrosive action and has
excellent lubricating properties and a
grease composition containing the composition.Heretofore, adding molybdenum oxysulfide dithiocarbamate to
grease has been tried in order to improve extreme pressure properties,
friction modifier properties and anti-wear properties of grease. Various
methods for producing such molybdenum oxysulfide dithiocarbamate have
been disclosed. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No.45-24562
discloses a method by which a compound having the general formula:
[R2 N-CS-S]2Mo2OmSn
(wherein m + n = 4, m = 2.35-3, n = 1.65-1, and R is a hydrocarbyl group
having 1 to 24 carbon atoms)
can be produced by reacting together a secondary amine, carbon disulfide 
and molybdenum trioxide.Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.48-56202 discloses a method in
which a compound represented by the following general formula:

(wherein R is an alkyl group)
can be produced by reacting the product given by the method of Japanese
Patent Publication No.45-24562 described above with phosphorus
pentasulfide,In addition, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 52-19629 and 52-106824
(FR-A-2 320 305) disclose methods by which a compound represented by the following
gene

ral formula:
(wherein R5 and R6 are independently hydrocarbyl groups having 1 to 24
carbon atoms, 1 is a number from 0.5 to 2.3. o is a number from 3.5 to
1.7 and 1 + o = 4)
can be produced by reacting carbon disulfide with a secondary amine in
an aqueous solution or suspension containing molybdenum trioxide or an
alkali metal salt or an ammonium salt of molybdic acid and an alkali
hydrogensulfide or an alkali sulfide in a molar ratio of 1 : 0.05-4.However, the compound of Japanese Patent Publication No. 45-24562 
above is inferior in heat resistance and, in the grease
preparation process, may cause a color change in the resulting grease.
On the other hand, the compound described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 48-56202 exhibits corrosive action against copper plates, thus the
use of the compound has been limited. The compound described in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Nos.52-19629 and 52-106824 also still has room for
improvement in terms of lubricating properties and corrosive properties.
That is, when the
