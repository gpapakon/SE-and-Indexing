<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas-feeding 
nozzle for use in a mould of an injection moulding machine 
according to the precharacterising part of claim 1. 
Such a gas-feeding nozzle is known from e.g. EP-A-0 529 232. For example, JP-A-64-14012 (corresponding to 
U. S. Patent 4,740,150) discloses an injection molding 
machine used for producing a molded article free of sink 
marks and distortion and excellent in appearance. In 
the technique disclosed in JP-A-64-14012, a molten 
thermoplastic resin is injected into the cavity of a 
mold, then a pressurized gas is introduced into the 
molten thermoplastic resin in the cavity to form a 
hollow structure within the thermoplastic resin, and the 
gas within the hollow structure is released into 
atmosphere before the mold is opened. The above JP-A-64-14012 also discloses a valve 
mechanism for introducing a pressurized gas. This valve 
mechanism is provided with a bore, and the pressurized 
gas is introduced through the bore into the molten 
thermoplastic resin injected into the cavity of the 
mold. A non-return valve is provided in the outlet end 
of the bore. The non-return valve prevents the molten 
thermoplastic resin injected into the cavity from 
flowing into the bore. Further, after the pressurized 
gas is introduced into the molten thermoplastic resin 
injected into the cavity, the non-return valve prevents 
the pressurized gas from flowing back from the hollow 
structure formed within the molten thermoplastic resin 
to the bore while the thermoplastic resin is cooled to 
solidify in the cavity.  
 The use of a non-return valve is also mentioned 
in US-A-5 044 924 and in EP-A-0 485 726 which replaces the 
non-return valve with a porous (sintered metal) body. However, when moulded articles are produced 
according to the technique disclosed in the above 
JP-A-64-14012, the following problem is liable to occur. 
When the gas within the hollow structure is released into 
atmosphere, resin fragments are blown off to adhere to the 
periphery of the non-return valve of the valve mechanism, 
or the resin remaining in the bore adheres to the non-return 
valve. As a result, the non-return valve can no 
longer function properly when a molten thermoplastic resin 
is injected into the cavity, and part of the molten 
thermoplastic resin flows into the bore through the non-return 
valve and further flows into a tubing for feeding a 
pressurised gas (sometime referred to as "gas tubing" 
hereinafter). When the molten thermoplastic resin has flowed 
into the bore
