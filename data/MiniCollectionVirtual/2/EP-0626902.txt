<ABSTRACT>
A fabric (50) comprises a multiplicity of yarn-like fiber bundles (51), which extend between and are interconnected at junctures (52). These fiber bundles and junctures define a pattern of openings (53) with the openings having a generally square configuration. Each of the fiber bundles comprises fiber segments which have been densified and compacted. In these fiber bundles many of the fiber segments are parallel to each other. As may be seen in the drawing, substantially at the center of the fiber bundle between adjacent junctures, there is a further entangled area (54) wherein the fibers tend to be circumferentially wrapped about the periphery of the parallel compacted fiber segments. As may be seen, the fiber bundle projects, from the opposite sides of the circumferentially entangled area. This configuration is hereinafter referred to as a "bow tie" or "bow tie area".

<DESCRIPTION>
For many years, attempts have been made to produce a
fabric having the strength and other characteristics of
woven or knitted fabrics without having to go through
the innumerable steps required to produce such fabrics.
To produce woven or knitted fabrics, a yarn must first
be produced. Yarns are normally produced by opening and
carding fibers and producing a web of fibers. The fiber
web is condensed into a sliver from which a roving is
produced by doubling and drawing the slivers. A number
of rovings are further doubled and drawn to produce a
yarn. To produce the final fabric, the yarns are woven
by a loom into a woven fabric or are knitted on a
complicated knitting machine. Often the yarn has to be
sized with starch or other materials before it can be
processed on the weaving or knitting machines.During the past twenty to thirty years, various
processes have been developed and attempts have been
made to produce a fabric directly from a web of fibers
eliminating most if not all of the various steps
described above. Some of these methods involved the use
of pins or needles disposed in a pattern. The needles
are inserted through a fiber web to produce openings in
the web and simulate the appearance of a woven fabric.
The resultant product is weak and requires the addition
of a chemical binder to produce desired strength. The
addition of binder substantially modifies the hand, 
flexibility, drape and other desirable physical
properties and makes it virtually impossible to
duplicate the desired properties of woven or knitted
fabrics. Other techniques have involved the use
of fluid or liquid forces, which are directed at the
fiber web in a predetermined pattern to manipulate the
fibers in a manner that the product produced has some of
the characteristics of woven or knitted fabrics. In
some of these prior techniques the fiber web is
supported on a member having a predetermined topography
while being treated with fluid forces to alter the fiber
configuration and produce a nonwoven fabric. Examples
of methods for producing nonwoven fabrics are disclosed
and described in U.S. Patents 1,978,620; 2,862,251;
3,033,721; 3,081,515; 3,485,706; and 3,498,874.While fabrics, produced by some of the methods
previously described, have been successful commercially,
the resulting fabrics still have not had all of the
desired characteristics of many woven and/or knitted
fabrics. All of these techniques have lacked the
ability to obtain either the desired combinations of
physical properties in the final fabric or the desired
