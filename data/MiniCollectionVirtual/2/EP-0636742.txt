<ABSTRACT>
Fibre materials are modified with a polymer containing at least one primary or secondary amino group and a bifunctional crosslinking agent, preferably a dialdehyde, and optionally dyed with water soluble, anionic dyes, preferably reactive dyes. The dyeing process with fibre materials modified according to the invention can be carried out low-salt or completely without salt and also alkali-free or using only minimal amounts of alkali.

 where a is from 0 to 4.
The process of claim 1, wherein the number of primary
or secondary amino groups in the polymer of the 

formula (I) is from 10 to 500.
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein

m
is from 1 to 4,
n
is from 10 to 500 and
a
is from 0 to 2.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 3, wherein

having a molecular weight from 500 to 2000 or
a polypropyleneimine having a molecular weight from

500 to 1000.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the bifunctional crosslinking agent of the formula

(II) is glyoxal.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 5, wherein
the concentratio
n of the polymers of the formula
(I) in aqueous solution is from 1 to 30% by weight,

preferably from 2 to 20% by weight, and that of the
compounds of the formula (II) is from 0.5 to 20% by

weight, preferably from 1 to 10% by weight.
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 6, wherein
the fiber materials are polyester fibers, synthetic

polyamide fibers and polyurethane fibers,
cellulose fibers, regenerated cellulose or a mixture

thereof, preferably cotton.

wherein


a) the fiber material is contacted with a mixture of
a polymer of the formula (I) and of a compound of

the formula (II) in aqueous or aqueously alkaline
solution, or
b) the fiber material is contacted first with a
polymer of the formula (I) and then with or

without intermediary drying with a compound of 
the formula (II).
A process for dyeing fiber materials with watersoluble,
anionic dyes, which comprises carrying out

the dyeing using low-electrolyte or completely
electrolyte-free and/or low-alkali or completely

alkali-free dye solutions (dyeing liquors, print
pastes) and using a fiber material modified as

claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 8.
The process of claim 9, wherein the dye is applied
to the fiber material together with the compound of

the formula (II) or in a subsequent separate step.
The process of at least one of claims 8 to 10,
wherein the aqueous or aqueously alkaline solution

contains from 0 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0
to 5% by weight, of NaOH or Na

The process of at least one of claims 1 to 11,
wherein the application of the treatment agent

and/or of the dye to the fiber material is effected
by an exhaust method or padding process, by spraying,

or by means of an inkjet process.
The process of at least one of claims 9 to 12,
wherein the water-soluble, anionic dye is a reactive

dye.
The process of at least one of claims 9 to 13,
wherein a fiber mixture of cellulose and polyester

fibers is initially modified and dyed or printed
with a reactive dye and then dyed with a disperse

dye.
A fiber material modified by a process as claimed in
at least one of claims 1 to 8.
A fiber material dyed by a process as claimed in at 
least one of claims 9 to 14.
