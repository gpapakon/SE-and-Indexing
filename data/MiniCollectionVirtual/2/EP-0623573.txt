<ABSTRACT>
In the preparation of m-chloroaromatics by means of isomerization of suitable o- and/or p-chloroaromatics on zeolites in liquid phase, the activity of the zeolites remains at a high level for a particularly long period if the process is carried out in the presence of 1 to 30 mol % of hydrogen based on chloroaromatics employed.

Process for preparing m-chloroaromatics of the 
formula (I) 


 
in which
 
X represents methyl or chlorine,
 
by isomerizing o- and/or p-chloroaromatics of the 

formulae (IIa) and (IIb) 

 
in which
 
X represents methyl or chlorine,
 
characterized in that o- and/or p-chloroaromatics of 

the formulae (IIa) and/or (IIb) are brought into 
contact with zeolites at from 150 to 500Â°C in the 

liquid phase and in the presence of from 1 to  
 

30 mol% of hydrogen, based on the chloroaromatics 
used. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
technical grade o- or p-dichlorobenzene or technical 

grade o- or p-chlorotoluene or any desired mixtures 
containing o- and/or p-dichlorobenzene and/or o-and/or 

p-chlorotoluene is used. 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that it is carried out at pressures at which the 

chloroaromatics used are present essentially in the 
liquid phase. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that it is carried out at pressures in the range 

from 10 to 100 bar. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that it is carried out in the presence of from 3 to 

10 mol% of hydrogen, based on the chloroaromatics 
used. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the zeolites used are those of the pentasil, 

mordenite and/or faujasite type. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that ZSM-5 zeolites in the H form are used. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that it is carried out at a weight hourly space 

velocity over the zeolites in the range from 0.05 to 
5 h
