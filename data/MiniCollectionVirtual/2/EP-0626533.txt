<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to collars 1 for holding a substantially cylindrical oblong component 2 on a support. The collar according to the invention is characterised essentially in that it includes a fastening rod 3, two half-rings 5, 6, means 7 for fastening the rod to one 6 of the two half-rings, means 8 for associating the two half-rings so that they form a complete ring 9 defining a cylindrical space 10 along a longitudinal axis 11 closed laterally and open at its two ends so as to surround the component 2, and means 20 for applying, at least at three points on the external wall of the oblong component, three elastic forces substantially concurrent on the longitudinal axis 11, the longitudinal axis passing through the triangle formed by the three points. Application, particularly, for fastening tubes or the like in constructions.

<CLAIMS>
A collar for holding a substantially cylindrical oblong part (2) 
of the tube type or similar relative to a support, the collar 

comprising: 

a fastener rod (3) suitable for being implanted in said 
support; 
two half-rings (5, 6) of substantially cylindrical general 
shape; 
means (7) for fixing said rod to one (6) of said two half-rings; 
and 
means (8) for associating the two half-rings to each other so 
that together they form a complete ring (9) defining a substantially 

cylindrical space (10) on a longitudinal axis (11) which is closed 
laterally and open at both ends (14, 15) so as to be suitable for 

surrounding said oblong part (2) of section that is smaller than that 
of said substantially cylindrical space, 
the collar being characterized by the fact that it further 
comprises: 
at least three tabs respectively secured to the two half-rings; 
means (23) for rotatably connecting a first end (24) of each 
tab with a half-ring; and 
means for exerting a resilient force on the second end (25) of 
each tab so as to urge said second end into said space (10) and so 

that the three resilient forces exerted by the second ends of the 
three tabs coincide substantially on said longitudinal axis (11), 

thereby tending to maintain said oblong part substantially centered 
on said longitudinal axis. 
A collar according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that said 
half-rings (5, 6) are made of a material having a degree of 

resilience, and that each tab (22) is cut out from the wall (26) of a 
half-ring (5) and is elastically deformed so that the second end (25) 

thereof lies within said space. 
A collar according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by the fact that 
there are at least four of said tabs which are disposed substantially  

 
symmetrically relative to planes (33, 34) including the longitudinal 

axis (11) of said space (10). 
A collar according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by 
the fact that the means (8) for associating the two half-rings (5, 6) 

to each other comprise at least two lateral tabs (40-41, 42-43) 
formed on each side of each half-ring, and at each of the ends 

thereof substantially in planes that include the longitudinal axis of 
said space such that when the two half-rings are associated with each 

other to form a complete ring (9) the lateral tabs of one of the two 

half-rings are at least partially in contact with the lateral tabs of 
the other half-ring, and means (44) for securing together said 

lateral tabs that are in contact in pairs, said means (44) including 
a projecting portion (45) formed on at least one (40, 41) of the 

lateral tabs of one (5) of the two half-rings, and means (46) for 
catching said projecting portion on the corresponding lateral tab 

(42, 43) relating to the other half-ring (6), said means (46) being 
constituted by an orifice (47) formed through said corresponding 

lateral tab so that said projecting portion can penetrate therein, 
and by a spring clip (48) secured to said projecting portion and 

suitable for coming into abutment against the lateral tab including 
said orifice. 
A collar according to claim 4, characterized by the fact that it 
includes at least two notches (50, 51) respectively formed in two 

contacting lateral tabs (40-42, 41-43), in register with the clip 
(48). 
A collar according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized by 
the fact that said half-ring (6) on which said fastener rod (3) is 

fixed comprises a U-shaped portion (52), the means (7) for fixing 
said rod to said half-ring (6) connecting said rod (3) to the base 

(53) of said U-shaped portion (52). 
A collar according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that the 
means (7) for fixing said fastener rod (3) to the base (53) of said 

U-shaped portion comprise a hole (54) formed through the base (53) of  
 

the U-shape, an hourglass-shaped insert (55) having an outer circular 
neck (56), a ring (57) surrounding said insert and situated in said 

circular neck, said ring including an outer circular groove (58) 
formed in said ring (57) and surrounding the edge (59) of said hole 

(54), and means (60) for connecting said fastener rod (3) to said 
bushing (55). 
A collar according to claim 7, characterized by the fact that the 
means (60) for connecting the fastener rod (3) to the insert (55) 

comprise a bore (61) formed in said bushing (55), said bore having an 
inside first thread (62), and a male portion (63) secured to said 

fastener rod (3), said male portion (63) having an outside second 
thread (64) complementary to the first thread (62). 
A collar according to claim 8, characterized by the fact that it 
includes a nut head (70) situated between the male portion (63) and 

one end of said fastener rod (3), the section of said nut head (70) 
being greater than that of the male portion (63). 
A collar for holding two substantially cylindrical oblong parts 
(2) of the tube type or similar relative to a support and according 

to the preceding claims, characterized by the fact that it comprises 
at least first and second half-rings (81, 82), the first and second 

half-rings being interconnected by a U-shaped part (90), third and 
fourth half-rings (83, 84), means (94, 95) for associating the third 

and fourth half-rings (83, 84) respectively with the first and second 
half-rings (81, 82) to constitute two cylindrical housings (85, 86) 

having substantially parallel axes (87, 88), and a tie rod (93) 
interconnecting the two ends (91, 92) of said U-shaped part (90).
