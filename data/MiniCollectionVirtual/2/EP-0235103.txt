<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for the vehicular 
transportation of a lock-equipped cassette (1) for valuable 

documents between a first station, e.g. a bank or a post office, 
to a second station. The cassette (1) is intended to be kept 

in a cassette holder or rack (2) in the first station and the 
second station, and also in the transporting vehicle. The 

cassette is provided with an electronic circuit (R1,22) which 
is characteristic to the cassette concerned and which is 

arranged to co-act with a controlling activating circuit (M1). 
When the cassette (1) is lifted from its cassette holder or 

rack a clock circuit located in the cassette is activated and, 
unless the cassette is replaced in a cassette holder, causes an 

alarm to be activated, this alarm being an acoustic alarm, 
a device for generating smoke within the cassette, releasing a 

dye onto the valuable documents contained in the cassette, 
etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for the vehicular 
transport of a cassette containing valuable documents between 
a first station and a second station. Such transportation of valuable documents takes place daily 
between the head office of a bank and one or more branch 
offices thereof. Strenuous efforts have been made in the past 
to reduce the risks entailed when transporting valuable docu足
ments this way, one of these risks being known as the "sidewalk 
factor", which has proven difficult to resolve. By "sidewalk 
factor" is meant the time taken to move a bag or cassette from 
a bank vault to a transport vehicle, the term cassette being 
that used in the following to describe valuable document containers. 
The risk of robbery is very high during this "sidewalk transfer" 
period, as is also the risk of the transport vehicle being 
hijacked. Consequently, it is the prime object of this 
invention to provide a system, or an arrangement, which in spite 
of its simplicity will practically eliminate all risk of 
robbery, while affording a high degree of security against 
internal manipulations. The main characteristic features of the invention are set forth 
in the following claims. The invention will now be described 
in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which 
Figure 1 is a vertical sectional view of a cassette provided 
with a cassette holder; Figure 2 illustrates an embodiment of an electric circuit 
forming part of the arrangement; and Figure 3 illustrates a modified electric circuit. Figure 1 is a vertical sectional view of a cassette 1 and 
associated cassette holder 2. The cassette 1 comprises an inner 
case 3, having four walls and a rectangular bottom 4, which in 
the illustrated embodiment presents a central, box-like recess 5.  Welded around the bottom 4 of the cassette is a frame structure 
6 which defines together with the vertical side walls of the 
inner case 3 a channel for accommodating the lower part 7 of 
an outer protective cover 8, which is fitted over the inner 
case 3. Two of the mutually opposing walls of the protective 
cover 8, of which one wall 9 is shown, have provided thereon 
guides (not shown). Each guide has mounted therein a respective 
locking bolt 10 and 11 which in their non-locking mode are urged 
towards one another by springs 12,13. The protective cover 8 
has an upper cover member 14 which presents an insertion opening 
for a lock 15. The lock 15 has a conical lower end 16 which, as 
the lock 15 is inserted into the opening, cams

<CLAIMS>
1. A system for transporting a cassette (1) equipped with 
a lock and containing valuable documents between a first 

station and a second station by vehicle, characterized in 
that the cassette (1) is provided with an electronic circuit 

which is characteristic to the particular cassette in question; 
in that the first station, the second station and the trans足

porting vehicle are each provided with a cassette holder or 
rack (2) which incorporates activating means (M1-M13) which 

control the electronic circuit (22) and an alarm circuit (A) 
incorporated in the cassette, the arrangement being such that 

said alarm circuit is activated when the activating means fail 
to activate the electronic circuit within a given time interval 

which exceeds a time interval determined by a timing device 
(C) incorporated in the electronic circuit, said timing device 

(C) being arranged to start a count when the cassette (1) is 
removed from its holder and to produce a control signal for 

activation of the alarm circuit (A) upon termination of said 
time interval. 
2. A system according to Claim 2, characterized in that in 
addition to the aforesaid activating means the cassette holder 

or rack(2) in said vehicle also incorporates an activating 
device (M10) which is characteristic to the vehicle concerned 

and which co-acts with an electronic identification circuit 
(R10) in the cassette (1) and with a switch means (31) con足

trolled by the cassette locking arrangement (15,16,10,11) 

the arrangement being such that in the event of the cassette 
(1) being unlocked in the vehicle said switch (31) is activated 

to close an electric circuit, via the electronic identification 
circuit (R10), to produce said control signal for activation 

of the alarm circuit (A). 
3. A system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the electronic circuits of the cassette (1) incorporate a 

plurality of magnetically actuable reed relays (R1-R13) which 
individually (R4) or in a number of mutual combinations (R1,R2) 

 
form said electronic circuit characteristic to the cassette 

concerned or said electronic identification circuit (R10); and 
in that the cassette holder (2) is provided with permanent 

magnets (M1-M13) in positions corresponding to the characteristic 
electronic circuit or circuits, or the reed relays incorporated 

in the electronic identification circuit. 
4. A system according to Claim 3, characterized in that those 
reed relays included in the aforesaid plurality of reed relays 

but not forming part of the characteristic electronic circuit 
or the electronic identification circuit are arranged, when in足

fluenced by means of a magnet, to close an electric circuit 
so as to produce said control signal for activating the alarm 

circuit (A).
