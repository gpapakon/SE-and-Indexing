<ABSTRACT>
The molecular weight distribution of carboxymethylcellulose 
or its salt is determined by gel permeation 

chromatography using a metal-amine complex and/or a 
metal-alkali complex as the mobile phase solvent. The column 

geometry (in. dia./length) and flow rate for this 
determination are 1:40-100 and 0.2-0.5 ml/min., respectively. 
According to this method, the GPC determination of 
molecular weight distribution can be performed under 

the same conditions for both starting pulp and CMC.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of determining 
the molecular weight distribution of carboxymethylcellulose 
or a salt thereof (hereinafter referred to 
briefly as CMC). While CMC is conventionally produced from pulp, an 
efficient quality and process control through its 
manufacturing stage demands that the conditions of 
molecular weight distribution analysis of CMC be 
identical with those of the material pulp. The molecular weight is generally determined by 
gel permeation chromatography (hereinafter referred to 
briefly as GPC). In the conventional GPC technology for molecular 
weight distribution analysis, said two determinations 
(for pulp and CMC) cannot be carried out under identical 
conditions because pulp and CMC cannot be dissolved 
within the same time period, the necessary derivatization 
of pulp complicates the determination procedure 
and/or the aging of the column packing is rapid and  
 
severe, to mention just a few difficulties. For these reasons, GPC analyses of the molecular 
weight distributions of pulp and CMC have heretofore 
been performed using different mobile phase solvents 
under different conditions, thus presenting the problem 
that the molecular weight distribution of starting pulp 
and that of CMC cannot be exactly compared in equal 
terms. The conventional GPC determination of starting 
pulp involves the use of a cascade of 2-3 columns 
packed with hydrous materials and, as the mobile phase solvent, 
many solvent species such as an aqueous solution of 
iron sodium tartrate complex, an aqueous solution of 
cadoxen, etc. in the case of aqueous systems or paraformaldehyde-dimethyl 
sulfoxide, etc. in the case of 
non-aqueous systems. Incidentally, Graham Agg and coworkers reported in 
1980 that they determined the molecular weight distributions 
of sulfite pulp and PHK pulp by GPC using an 
aqueous solution of iron sodium tartrate complex as the 
mobile phase solvent but their samples for analysis 
were pulps and not CMC (Int. Dissolving Pulps Conf. 
[Conf. Pap.] 5th, 224-229. TAPPI). Meanwhile, the GPC analysis of CMC has been 
performed using 3-4 columns packed with hydrous 
materials and, as the mobile phase solvent, aqueous solutions  
 
of sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, etc. The object of this invention is to provide a 
method by which the molecular weight and molecular 
weight distribution of CMC can be determined under the 
same conditions as its starting pulp. The inventors of this invention did much research 
to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages of
