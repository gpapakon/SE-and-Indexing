<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor memory circuit, when a sense amplifier is not 
selected, a pair of complementary data lines connected 

to the sense amplifier 
are short-circuited to be brought to the same potential, and when the 

sense amplifier is selected, the short-circuiting is cancelled. 
Therefore, the 

complementary data lines are in no way put in a floating condition, and 
when the sense amplifier is selected, a voltage difference 

corresponding to 
the data to be read out is immediately generated between the 

complementary data lines. Accordingly, the data is quickly fixed or 
settled, without being influenced by a preceding read-out data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device
according to the opening portion of claim 1, and more
specifically to a semiconductor memory device having a pair of
data lines for outputting a content of a memory cell in the
form of a differential signal.From EP-A-0449282, a semiconductor memory device is known which
has a pair of complementary data lines for outputting a
content of a memory cell. When a pair of data lines carries a
potential difference at the time when new data are to be
placed on them, it takes a relatively long time until the
potentials on the data lines reflect the new data since the
polarity of the differential voltage must possibly be
reversed.From US-A-4 272 834 and from IEEE Journal of Solid-State-Circuits,
vol 28, no. 4 April 1993, New York, USA, pages 484-489,
Yokomizo: "Design Techniques for High-Throughput BiCMOS
Self-Timed SRAMs", a data line potential setting circuit is
known which short-circuits a data line pair before receiving
new data.On the other hand it would be desirous to increase the
possibilities in high-speed operation and increased memory
integration density and thus to reduce the time to obtain a
proper read-out potential information is settled on the data
line.Referring to enclosed FIG. 1, there is shown a circuit
diagram, corresponding to one bit, of one example of a 
conventional semiconductor memory device, in which a bipolar
differential amplifier circuit is connected to a static memory
cell. In the shown example, a pair of complementary digit
lines D and DB are pulled up through resistors R1 and R2 to a
high voltage supply voltage Vcc, and a memory cell MC is
connected between the pair of digit lines D and DB and also
connected to a word line WL, so that when the memory cell MC
is selected by the word line WL, a content of the memory cell
MC is outputted to the pair of digit lines D and DB in the
form of a differential voltage signal.The pair of digit lines D and DB are also connected to a sense
amplifier 10, which amplifies the output of the memory cell MC
read out on the pair of digit lines D and DB, and supplies the
amplified output to a multiplexor and current-to-voltage
conversion amplifier circuit 12. The sense amplifier 10 includes a pair of NPN bipolar transistors
Q11 and Q12 having their base connected to the pair of digit lines D and
DB, respectively. A collector of each of the bipolar transistors Q11 and
Q12 is connected to a high voltage supply voltage Vcc. An emitter of the
bipolar transistors Q11 and Q12 are connected to a
