<ABSTRACT>
A television system having sync suppression scrambling and descrambling which includes in band and out of band signaling methods. The in band signaling method modulates the IF sound carrier of a premium video channel with timing and data pulses (Figs. 2A, 2B) while the out of band signaling method modulates the previously modulated IF sound on a separate carrier onto a separate out of band data carrier (Figs. 3A, 3B). The in band signaling method uses a descrambler which tunes a channel before demodulating the timing and data pulses from the sound carrier while the out of band signaling method tunes a selected data carrier to demodulate the timing and data pulses. In both methods, the timing pulses are used to restore the levels of the synchronization pulses in the sync suppressed video signal, and thus descramble the signal, while the data pulses are used for addressable messaging to the descrambler including authorization. The out of band descrambler provides broadband sync restoration for a particular channel and thus does not need a broadband tuner for the video signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM FOR BROADBAND DESCRAMBLING OF SYNC SUPPRESSEDTELEVISION SIGNALSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention pertains generally to subscription television systems using sync suppression scrambling and descrambling which distorts TV signals when displayed, except at authorized receivers which are equipped with descramblers, and, more particularly, is directed to broadband descrambling of sync suppressed TV signals. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAlthough the invention is not necessarily limited thereto, it is particularly suitable for use and trans¬ mission of subscription TV programs by cable systems. The invention may also be applied wherever sync suppres¬ sion scrambling and descrambling of television signals is used whether the transmission link is a cable, broadcast, or satellite link.Sync suppression scrambling and descrambling of television signals is a well known and accepted technique for encoding and decoding subscription television signals where the amplitude of the vertical or horizontal syn¬ chronizing (sync) signals, or both, is attenuated so as to prevent a television receiver from locking onto the signal. The picture received by a subscriber receiver not equipped with a descrambler rolls and is so distorted so as to make viewing impossible or uncomfortable. Reference may be had to U.S. Patent No. 4,466,017 issued to Robert Banker on August 14, 1984 for further informa¬ tion as to sync suppression scrambling and descramblingSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 of television signals. The disclosure of Banker is incorporated herein by reference.Briefly described, sync suppression scrambling and descrambling of TV signals for subscription TV programs may be carried on by generating sync suppression pulses in overlapping time relationship with the horizonal and/or vertical sync pulses of the TV signal. Timing pulses are generated in selected time relationship with the sync suppression pulses such that each of the timing pulses and the sync suppression pulses have a selected time delay with respect to each other. This time delay may be selected, preferably digitally, from a plurality of different delays or dynamically varied. The horizon¬ tal and/or vertical sync pulses in the television signal are thereby suppressed below their normal amplitude. Sync detectors of conventional TV receivers at the subscriber are incapable of locking onto the attenuated sync pulses of the transmitted television signal. The timing pulses are transmitted with the TV signals, preferably by modulating the IF audio carrier thereof, during
