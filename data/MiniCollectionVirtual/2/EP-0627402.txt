Preparation process for a hydroxyphenylacetic acid
of formula (I):



in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkoxyl
group as well as its salts, characterized in that the

corresponding free or salified hydroxymandelic acid of
formula (II):



in which R has the meaning given previously and M represents
a hydrogen, sodium, potassium atom is reacted in an aqueous

medium, at a temperature greater than or equal to 50°C in
the presence of finely powdered nickel and a metal hydroxide

of formula (III)

M
1
OH

where M
1
 represents a sodium or potassium atom and is
identical to M in the case where M also represents a sodium

or potassium atom, in a such manner that the reaction medium
has a pH equal to or greater than 9, in order to obtain the

corresponding salt of the hydroxyphenylacetic acid of
formula (I) which, if desired, is displaced according to the

usual methods in order to obtain the corresponding acid

which is isolated or, if desired, is salified according to
the usual methods. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that
it is carried out in a molecular hydrogen atmosphere under a

pressure of 1 to 5 bars.
Process according to any one of claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that it is carried out at a temperature

comprised between 75 and 150°C.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of

1 to 2 atom-gram of finely powdered nickel per mole of
product of formula (II).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of 1

to 3 moles of a metal hydroxide M
1
OH where M
1
 represents a
sodium or potassium atom per mole of product of formula

(II).
Orthohydroxyphenylacetic acid prepared by the
process according to any one of claims 1 to 5.
