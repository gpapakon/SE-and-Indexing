<ABSTRACT>
What is specified is a device and a method for handling the used packaging of a roll of web material, in which the web of material is freed of the end-face cover and of the circumferential wrapping in an unpacking station. The handling of the circumferential wrapping, which can attain a considerable size and a considerable weight, is difficult. The handling is to be simplified. For this purpose, a roll is produced from the circumferential wrapping and the roll is compressed transversely to its axis. Provided for this purpose is a folding device (5) which folds the circumferential wrapping (21) together in multiple layers and presses it flat, and a transport device (17) which is arranged between the unpacking station and the folding device.

Device for handling the used circumferential wrapping of a roll of web material 
behind an unpacking station for removing end covers and the circumferential 

wrapping, characterised by a folding means (5) which folds the circumferential 
wrapping (21) into multiple layers and flattens it by winding the circumferential 

wrapping (21) into a roll and compressing it, and by a conveyor means (4) 
arranged between the unpacking station (3) and the folding means (5). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the folding means (5) has a 
winding means (19), in particular a winding shaft (19), which winds the 

circumferential wrapping into the roll and a downstream squeezing arrangement, in 
particular a squeezing roll arrangement (28), which compresses the roll. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the squeezing roll arrangement 
(28) has a roll nip (31) arranged substantially perpendicularly to the axis of the 

winding shaft (19). 
Device according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that the winding shaft (19) 
is arranged adjacent to a stripping means (25) which is movable in the direction of 

the longitudinal axis of the winding shaft (19). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that the winding shaft (19) has an 
axially extending recess (50) into which the stripping means (25) can be 

introduced. 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 5, characterised in that a cutting means 

(34) is arranged downstream of the squeezing roll arrangement (28) 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that a collecting container (52) is 
arranged below the cutting means (34), one side wall (54) thereof being situated 

below the intermediate space between the cutting means (34) and the squeezing 
roll arrangement (28).  

 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 7, characterised in that the squeezing roll 
arrangement (28) has at least one driven roll (30). 
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that a control means is provided to 
control the feed of the roll through the squeezing roll arrangement (28). 
Device according to claim 9, characterised in that the control means controls the 
feed in such a manner that the piece of the roll remaining after the last cut of the 

cutting means (34) has a predetermined minimum length which is shorter than the 
distance between the squeezing roll arrangement (28) and the cutting means (34). 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 10, characterised in that the winding shaft 
(19) has a clamping means (40, 42). 
Device according to claim 11, characterised in that the clamping means can be 
actuated pneumatically or hydraulically with the aid of a fluid. 
Device according to claim 11 or claim 12, characterised in that the clamping means 
(40, 42) has a circumferential portion (40) of the winding shaft (19) which can 

pivot about an axis (41) extending substantially parallel to the axis of the winding 
shaft, the circumferential portion (40) forming part of the surface of a circular 

cylinder, the axis of which coincides with that of the winding shaft (19) in the 
tensioned state of the winding shaft (19). 
Device according to claim 13, characterised in that the circumferential portion (40) 
is connected via a tension spring means (43) to a fitting (38) of the winding shaft 

(19). 
Device according to claim 14, characterised in that the clamping means (40, 42) 
has a hose (42) which is arranged between the fitting (38) and the circumferential 

portion (40) and can be pressurised by the fluid. 
Device according to claim 15, characterised in that a stop (44) is provided to limit 
inward movement of the circumferential portion (40) before the hose (42) has 

reached its smallest volume upon relief of the pressure.  
 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 16, characterised in that the conveyor 
means (4) is provided at its inlet with a tension roll arrangement (12, 13) with at 

least one driven roll (12) and a roll nip (15), at least one roll (13) being movably 
mounted in order to open the roll nip (15). 
Device according to claim 17, characterised in that a supporting roll arrangement

is provided in the unpacking station (3), the driven rolls (6, 12) of the tension and 
supporting roll arrangements (6, 7; 12, 13) having substantially the same 

circumferential speed. 
Device according to claim 17 or claim 18, characterised in that a guide channel
