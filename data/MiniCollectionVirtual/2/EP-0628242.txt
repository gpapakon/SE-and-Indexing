<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a powered lawn edger (1) which is 
steerable in the manner of a wheelbarrow. The edger has a Y or T-shaped 

frame (5,35,36,46) including a pair of handles (3,20,30,33,43,50). A 
power unit (4,40) is mounted on the frame forward of the operator 

between the handles and a ground engaging wheel (2). A cutting blade 
(17) is rotatable about an output shaft (16) of a gear box (7) which is 

powered from the power unit via a centrifugal clutch (57) having a brake 
(14). A debris deflector (15) is mounted on the wheel stub axle (10) 

and is not movable with height adjustment of the cutter blade (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to powered lawn edgers.
In particular, the present invention relates to a safe,
compact, streamlined, and extremely manoeuvrable powered
lawn edger which is steerable with both hands in the manner
of a wheelbarrow.Powered lawn edgers can be divided into several
categories. One category is of hand-held devices which do
not normally have any ground-engaging wheels and which are
carried by the operator. The best known of these devices
are the various types of brush cutter or trimming devices,
in which the cutter head rotates about a substantially
horizontal plane in normal use. Therefore, in order to
trim the edge of a lawn adjacent a footpath, for example,
it is necessary for such a device to be completely carried
whilst being twisted by approximately 90° about its
longitudinal axis. This is both difficult and tiring to
execute.Another category of powered lawn edgers is of multiwheeled
carriages, supported on wheels, and which are
pushed along their intended path. The best known member of
this category is essentially a conventional domestic lawn
mower-type, but with a cutting element rotating in a
vertical plane.CH-A-0520461 discloses a powered mowing machine
steerable by an operator with both hands in the manner of
a wheelbarrow, the machine comprising:
   an elongate member; a handle including grips; a
ground-engaging wheel; a cutting device; a power unit; and
a power train;
   wherein the handle is attached adjacent one end of the
member, the cutting device is mounted adjacent the other
end, forward of the ground-engaging wheel, the power unit
is carried by the member and is located in front of an
operator holding the grips, and the power train
interconnects the power unit and the cutting device and is
enclosed by the member. According to the present invention, in a powered
machine of the type described immediately above, the
cutting device is rotatable in a plane parallel to the
longitudinal axis of the elongate member, so that the
machine can be used as a lawn edger, the ground-engaging
wheel is adjacent said other end of the member, the
machine's centre of gravity is intermediate the grips and
the ground-engaging wheel, and the handle can be
manipulated to twist the machine about said longitudinal
axis, to tilt the cutting device with respect to its
vertical plane of rotation.The machine of the invention can be operated without
great effort. An edger of the invention has a negligible
turning circle, can be tilted easily to either side, and
yet supports a substantial

A powered machine steerable by an operator with both
hands in the manner of a wheelbarrow, the machine

comprising:

an elongate member (5,35,36,46); handle means
(3,30,33,43,50) including grips (20); a ground-engaging

wheel means (2,80,82,83); a cutting device (17); a power
unit (4,40); and a power train (7,56,57);
wherein the handle means (3, 30, 33, 43, 50) is attached adjacent one end
of the elongate member (5,35,36,46), the cutting device (17) is mounted adjacent the

other end, forward of the ground-engaging wheel means (2,80,82,83), the
power unit (4,40) is carried by the elongate member (5,35,36,46) and is locatable in front

of an operator holding the grips (20), and the power train (7,56,57)
interconnects the power unit (4,40) and the cutting device (17) and is

enclosed by the elongated member (5,35,36,46),

   characterised in that the cutting device (17) is rotatable
in a plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the

elongate member (5,35,36,46) so that the machine can be used as a lawn
edger, the ground-engaging wheel means (2,80,82,83) is adjacent said

other end of the member (5,35,36,46), the machine's centre of gravity is
intermediate the grips (20) and the ground-engaging wheel means (2,80,82,83),

and the handle means (3,30,33,43,50) can be manipulated to twist the
machine about said longitudinal axis, to tilt the cutting

device (17) with respect to its vertical plane of rotation.
An edger as claimed in claim 1, having means
(11,12,13) for adjusting the height of the cutting device

relative to the wheel's axis of rotation.
An edger as claimed in claim 2, wherein the height
adjustment means comprises an adjustment handle (12)

resiliently biased towards a setting plate (13), wherein
the handle and the setting plate are releasably engageable

at a plurality of engaged positions, the height being
adjustable to any of a plurality of predetermined heights

each corresponding to one of the engaged positions.
An edger as claimed in any preceding claim,
additionally comprising means (11,12,13) for adjusting the

the height of the debris deflector relative to the ground
being unchanged with operation of the height adjustment

means.
An edger as claimed in claim 4, wherein the debris
deflector is supported by an axle (10) about which the

ground-engaging wheel rotates, the debris deflector
preferably depending from, and preferably being pivotable

a transmission (7,16,56,57) including gear reduction,
wherein the gear ratio between the power unit and the blade

is from 1.5:1 to 8:1, preferably between 2.1:1 and 5:1, and
