<ABSTRACT>
A paint brush consists of a handle (11) which is provided at its lower end with at least one resilient catch lug (13) formed on a tongue (12) and of a bristle head which has a bristle tuft (18) and a clamp (16) surrounding it. The handle (11) can be introduced by its lower end into the clamp (16) and can be fixed on the bristle head in an exchangeable manner by means of the engagement of the catch lug (13) in a cutout (17) in the clamp wall. Rapid and simple exchange with firm holding is achieved in that the handle (11) has, at its lower end, stabilizing projections (14) which are arranged on opposite sides, can be introduced into the clamp (16), and rest in the inserted state against the inner side of the clamp wall, partially following its inner contour.

<CLAIMS>
Paintbrush with a handle (11; 21; 31), which is provided at its lower
end with at least one resilient detent (13; 23; 33) constructed on a tongue

(12; 22; 32), and a bristle head, which has a bristle bundle (18; 28; 38)
and a ferrule (16; 26; 36) embracing the latter, the handle being insertable

with its lower end into the ferrule and through the engagement of the detent
in a recess (17; 27; 37) of the ferrule wall is replaceably fixable to the

bristle head and at its lower end the handle (11; 21; 31) has stiff stabilizing
projections (14; 24; 34) shaped on opposite sides and insertable into

the ferrule (16; 26; 36) and in the inserted state engage in large-area,
close manner on the inside of the ferrule wall, zonally f
ollowing the inner
contour thereof, in such a way that a precise guide is formed and an

inclined position of the ferrule relative to the handle is prevented.
Paintbrush according to claim 1, characterized in that, at the foot of
the tongue (12; 22; 32) or the stabilizing projections (14; 24; 34), the

handle (11; 21; 31) has a step (15), on which engages the upper edge of the
ferrule (16; 26; 36) with the handle (11; 21; 31) inserted.
Paintbrush according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that, in the
inserted state, the tongue (12; 22; 32) engages on the inside of the ferrule

wall.
Paintbrush according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the handle (21) has two detents (23) on in each case one tongue (22).
Paintbrush according to claim 4, characterized in that the detents (23)
are insertable in recesses (27), which are formed on opposite sides of the

ferrule wall.
Paintbrush according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
the stabilizing projections (24) are interconnected by means of a web (29).
Paintbrush according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that
the engagement area between each stabilizing projection (14; 24; 34) and the

inside of the ferrule wall extends over at least two non-parallel planes. 
Paintbrush according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
the handle (31) comprises a substantially straight grip (31a) and an attachment

fitting (35) connectable to the grip (31) and having the detent (33)
and the stabilizing projections (34).
Paintbrush according to claim 8, characterized in that the attachment
fitting (35) has a bend.
Paintbrush according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the attachment
fitting (35) is locked to the grip (31a).
