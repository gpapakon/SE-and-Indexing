<ABSTRACT>
Espresso machine having a continuous-flow heater (3) and a pump (2) intended for the brewing-water operation, with the special feature that the continuous-flow heater (3) has a sufficiently large volume to operate it as a steam boiler for the generation of steam when the heating is switched on and the pump (2) is switched off.

<CLAIMS>
Espresso machine having an instantaneous water 
heater (3) which exhibits a water-channelling chamber 

(16) and an electric heating means (4) assigned to the 
chamber, having a fresh-water container (1) and a pump 

(2) arranged between the fresh-water container (1) and 
the instantaneous water heater (3), and having a brewed-water 

outflow (7), which is arranged downstream of the 
instantaneous water heater and can be opened as required, 

and a steam outlet (10), characterized in that the 
instantaneous water heater (3) exhibits a chamber with a 

capacity of approximately 30 to 60 ccm, it being possible 
for the fresh water to be fed to said chamber from below 

via a fresh-water inlet (19), and the chamber exhibiting 
a brewed-water outlet (20) located at the top, in that 

the chamber is provided with inwardly projecting heat-exchanger 
ribs (21), in that the pump (2) is switched off 

for the formation of steam, and in that the pump (2) is 
designed with a non-return valve or is self-closing. 
Espresso machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the instantaneous water heater (3) 

is designed with a circular cross-section, and the heat-exchanger 
ribs (21) are distributed on the circumference, 

extending in the axial direction. 
Espresso machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the fresh-water inlet exhibits an 

inlet stub (19) which projects into the interior of the 
instantaneous water heater (3), is closed at the end and 

exhibits lateral outlet openings (23). 
Espresso machine according to one of Claims 1 to  
 

3, characterized in that an operating-mode switch (13) is 
provided, and this can be used to switch over between 

hot-water preparation and steam formation, and in that 
the operating-mode switch (13), in hot-water-preparation 

mode, simultaneously switches on the pump (2) and, in 
steam-formation mode, switches off said pump. 
Espresso machine according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the instantaneous water heater (3) 

has arranged downstream of it a multi-way valve (9) which 
is positively coupled to the operating-mode switch (13). 
Espresso machine according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the instantaneous 

water heater (3) exhibits a tubular section (16) which is 
designed as an aluminium extruded profile which is closed 

at its end surfaces by means of end caps (17, 18). 
Espresso machine according to at least one of 
Claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the instantaneous 

water heater (3) exhibits an aluminium diecasting, 
comprising a tubular section (16) and an integrated base 

part (17), in that said diecasting is closed by means of 
an end cap (18) caulked thereto, and in that the heating 

means (4) is cast into the wall in the form of an 
electrically insulated heating coil (24). 
Espresso machine according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the inner surface of 

the instantaneous water heater is surface-finished. 
Espresso machine according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the surface finish consists of an 

anodic coating.
