<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides for a cereal composition, particularly in a ready-to-eat cereal, that contains beta-carotene (BC) in an amount ranging from about 0.001 % to about 0.02 % based on the dry weight of the cereal composition. The beta-carotene may be incorporated in the form of water insoluble beadlets or may be added in a soluble form with a sweetening agent during manufacture of the composition. The cereal composition containing BC retains good stability, and normal color, flavor and aroma characteristics as compared with analogous cereal compositions without beta-carotene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ready-to-eat cereal products
enriched with beta-carotene (BC). More particularly, it relates
to cereal products in which the beta-carotene is present in a
stabilized form which does not change the color, flavor or
appearance of the product and in which the beta-carotene does
not degrade under normal storage conditions.Beta-carotene has, for many years, been used in food
products in order to add color. For example, in U.S. Patent No.
4,565,702, which is concerned with dietary fiber compositions
comprising insoluble fiber and soluble fiber formed into
flavored food products, small amounts of beta-carotene are used
to provide an orange color in orange-flavored tablets, fruit
rolls and snack bars. Although beta-carotene is known to be an
excellent source of vitamin A, it has heretofore not been
feasible to incorporate beta-carotene into cereal-based products
such as ready-to-eat cereals because the addition of sufficient
beta-carotene to provide an effective amount of vitamin A also
causes undesirable changes in the color, flavor and appearance
of the product. Furthermore, since beta-carotene is a natural
anti-oxidant, it will degrade quickly, by oxidation, under
normal storage conditions.It is therefore a principal object of this invention
to provide cereal products enriched with beta-carotene in which
the beta-carotene is present in sufficient amount to provide a
source of vitamin A. It is a further object of the invention to
provide such an enriched cereal in which the beta-carotene is in
stable form and does not adversely alter the color, flavor or
aroma of the product.This invention provides cereal compositions,
particularly ready-to-eat cereals, containing beta-carotene in
an amount ranging preferably from 0.001% to 0.02%, percentage
based on the dry weight of the cereal composition. The beta-carotene 
incorporated into the composition is encapsulated
within variably sized water insoluble beadlets.
The
encapsulating material is preferably gelatin or alginate, having
a particle size ranging from 50 µm (microns) to µm 500
microns. The beta-carotene incorporated into these compositions
by these procedures remains stable under normal storage
conditions, and does not produce a product with color, flavor or
aroma characteristics which are significantly different over
analogous cereal compositions not containing beta-carotene.Figure 1 is a graph showing study of stability and content
of BC in a cereal composition over time with cross-linked BC at

is present in the cereal product in an amount

ranging from 0.001% to 0.02% based on the dry
weight of the ready-to-eat cereal.
The ready-to-eat cereal of claim 1 or 2, wherein said
water insoluble beadlets range in size

from 50 µm (microns) to 500 µm (microns).

any preceding

claim, wherein beta-carotene is
present in the cereal product in an amount ranging from

0.001% to 0.01%.

any preceding

claim, wherein beta-carotene is
encapsulated in crosslinked gelatin and the beadlets have
