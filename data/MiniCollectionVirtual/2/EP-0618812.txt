<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of treatment
of conditions characterized by inflammation or
inflammatory responses. More specifically, it concerns the
use of protease nexin-1 in the treatment of inflammation and
inflammatory diseases.The structure and recombinant production of
protease nexin-I are described in European patent
application 251505, published 7 January 1988, and
incorporated herein by reference. The contents of this
publication are substantially the same as those of above-referenced
serial no. 07/025,450, which case is allowed
and involved in an interference. As disclosed in these
documents, protease nexin-I occurs naturally in two
closely related forms, PN-Iα and PN-Iβ, which result from
alternate splicing events in the mRNA message encoding
the protein. PN-Iα and PN-Iβ consist of 378 and 379 
amino acids, respectively, and differ only in that the
arginyl residue at position 310 of PN-Iα is replaced by a
thr-gly sequence in PN-Iβ. PN-Iα and PN-Iβ can be
prepared individually using recombinant means or the
natively produced protein can be isolated from various
tissue sources such as human fibroblasts or glial cells.
Methods for purifying protease nexin-I to apparent
homogeneity from fibroblasts have been described by
Scott, R.W., et al., J. Biol Chem (1985) 260:7029-7034.The ability of protease nexin-I to inhibit
various anticlotting factors such as urokinase and tissue
plasminogen activator is well established. It is also
known that protease nexin-I stimulates the growth of
neurites. It has now been demonstrated that protease
nexin-I is effective in preventing degradation of
connective tissue and in the treatment of inflammatory
diseases such as arthritis.The invention is directed to pharmaceutical
compositions and the use of protease nexin-1 for the
manufacture of a composition for use in the treatment of
inflammation and arthritis. The compositions may contain
either PN-Iα or PN-Iβ or both, and may contain additional
active ingredients as well as standard excipients. The
treatment of inflammation and arthritis involves
administration of the foregoing compositions in suitable
protocols for the control of these conditions. Local
administration to the site of inflammation is particularly
preferred.The conditions for which treatment with
protease nexin-I is indicated include inflammation and
arthritis, in particular, acute or chronic inflammation,
acute or chronic arthritis. Particular conditions that
may benefit from administration of the compounds of the 
invention include
