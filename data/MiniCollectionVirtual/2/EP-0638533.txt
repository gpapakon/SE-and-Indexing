<ABSTRACT>
A process of producing an α-olefin which comprises carrying out 
separately the growth of ethylene with triethyl aluminum and the growth of 

ethylene with tributyl aluminum, displacing the resulting higher trialkyl 
aluminum with ethylene, thereby forming triethyl aluminum and an α-olefin, and 

displacing at least part of the resulting triethyl aluminum with butene 
contained in the resulting α-olefin, thereby forming tributyl aluminum. 
The present invention permits the efficient production of α-olefins 
containing linear α-olefins in extremely high purity. The α-olefins will 

find use as comonomers for polyolefins (whose demand is increasing recently) and 
also as raw materials of synthetic lubricants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of producing an α-olefin and, 
more particularly, to a process of producing an α-olefin containing a linear 
α-olefin in high purity. An α-olefin is an olefin oligomer of carbon number 4 to 18 which has a 
straight-chain (unbranched) molecular structure in which there is a double bond 
at the α position. An α-olefin, especially the one containing a linear α-olefin 
in high purity, finds use as a monomer to modify polyolefins or as a raw 
material for synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, and surface active agents. 
Especially, those of carbon number 6 to 10 are in general use. For example, an 
α-olefin of carbon number 6 to 8 is used mainly as a comonomer of polyolefins. 
It is required to be linear and highly pure, and it enjoys a large demand. 
Also, there is in an increasing demand for an α-olefin of carbon number 10 or 
so as a raw material for synthetic lubricants. An α-olefin is produced conventionally by polymerization of ethylene by 
the use of a Ziegler catalyst. There are two known processes: one gives rise to 
an α-olefin whose molecular weight distribution obeys the Schultz-Flory 
distribution, and the other gives rise to an α-olefin whose molecular weight 
distribution obeys the Poisson distribution. The former process usually 
employs a titanium-based catalyst or a zirconium-based catalyst to convert  
 
ethylene into an α-olefin oligomer. Its advantage is the ability to give rise 
to an α-olefin containing a linear α-olefin in high purity (with small 
amounts of branched α-olefin). On the other hand, it suffers the 
disadvantage of giving rise to an α-olefin whose molecular weight 
distribution is usually broad and obeys the Schultz-Flory distribution. If it 
is used to produce an α-olefin of carbon number 10 or below in large amounts 
which has a comparatively narrow molecular weight distribution, the resulting 
product contains α-olefins of carbon number 4 to 6 (such as butene) in an 
extremely large amount. In other words, it is not suitable for the efficient 
production of α-olefins of carbon number 10 or below, which find use as a 
comonomer of polyolefins or a raw material of synthetic lubricants. On the other hand, there is a process of oligomerizing ethylene into an α 
-olefin by the use of trialkyl aluminum (such as triethyl aluminum and tributyl 
aluminum). It offers the advantage of giving rise to an α-olefin whose 
molecular weight distribution obeys the Poisson distribution and selectively 
giving rise to an α-olefin of carbon number
