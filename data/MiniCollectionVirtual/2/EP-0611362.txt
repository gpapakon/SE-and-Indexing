<ABSTRACT>
A rider roll system for exerting an even nip load force along the surface of a roll of paper (24, 324) being wound from a continuous on-coming web (W) in a winder comprises a plurality of rider roll wheel elements (30a, 30b, 30c,... 330), each of which is connected to a common source (76, 376) of hydraulic pressure to provide the same rolling nip force against the wound paper roll (24, 324). The rider roll wheel elements (30a, 30b, 30c,... 330) are mounted to a beam (22, 322) which is translationally movable above the wound paper roll (24, 324). The beam (22, 322) and individual rider roll wheel elements (30a, 30b, 30c,... 330) are moved upwardly as a function of the increase in the diameter of the wound paper roll (24, 324). The relationship of the beam (22, 322) movement relative to the diameter of the wound paper roll (24, 324) is controlled by a programmable logic controller (84, 384). The individual wheel elements (30a, 30b, 30c,... 330) are loaded against a counter-balance force (52a, 52b, 52c,... 352) so as to provide equal, but cushioned, nip force against the surface of the wound paper roll (24, 324) at short intervals along its length. The magnitude of the evenly applied nip load force is also controlled as a function of the wound paper roll (24, 324) diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the winding of a continuous web of 
material, such as paper manufactured on a papermaking machine. More 
particularly, this invention relates to the construction and control of a rider 
roll for applying pressure to a roll of paper being wound in a winder. Still 
more particularly, this invention relates to an articulated rider roll system 
comprising a multiple number of axially aligned individual wheel elements 
for applying a controlled nip force against the surface of a roll of paper 
being wound by controlling the movement of a beam on which the wheel 
elements are mounted, and against which they are biased, and the nip load 
force, both as a function of the paper roll diameter. Rider rolls for stabilizing and controlling wound-in tension in the 
paper web in a winder have been used almost since the invention of the 
winder itself. The dynamics of winding an on-coming web of paper into a 
wound paper roll, which may be 30 feet long and 6 feet in diameter, 
requires careful support and pressure to maintain the wound-in web 
tension at desired levels at different radial distances in the diameter of the 
wound roll. Also important is the function of nip mechanics of the rider roll 
against the surface of the wound roll to provide the desired density of 
the wound roll while maintaining the desired web tension. Nip mechanics 
has been defined as a strain inducing mechanism that increases the sheet 
tension in the outside layers of a paper roll beyond the unwind stand 
tension.  
 The tension in the paper web at the rider roll nip controls the relative 
slippage between the first few layers of paper. After the paper web has 
been covered with several layers of on-coming paper, the wound-in tension 
at the surface has an effect on the paper previously wound, so it is 
important that the initial wound-in tension be controlled and correct for the 
diameter of the roll at each stage in its development. Prior rider roll configurations have included a continuous metal roll 
extending across the entire working width of a winder, which essentially 
corresponds to the length of the paper roll being wound. As winder speeds 
increased, and as the length of the wound paper roll increased, 
improvements were made in the support provided by the rider roll by 
biasing the rider roll pneumatically against the wound paper roll (Printz et 
al, U.S. Patent No. 3,237,877), and by forming the rider roll into segments 
extending axially across the width of the winder so that separate segments 
could
