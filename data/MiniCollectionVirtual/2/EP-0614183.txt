<ABSTRACT>
A disk player has a magazine for storing disks and a disk transport 
mechanism transporting a selected disk between four positions including an 

eject position, a load position, a playback position, and a store position which 
lie in a single plane. The selected disk is carried upon a tray from the eject 

position to the load position where the selected disk is partially removed from 
the tray to the playback position above a disk reader. The magazine accepts 

a plurality of disks. A magazine driving mechanism provides relative 
movement between the magazine and a plane of transport of the disk transport 

mechanism permitting a selected disk to be inserted or removed from the 
magazine at the store position. A disk clamping mechanism moves the disk 

reader relative to a clamp assembly in order to clamp the selected disk to a 
turntable. Both the disk clamping mechanism and the magazine driving 

mechanism are driven from a common drive source. An output of the 
common drive source is switched by the disk transport mechanism via a 

planetary gear assembly. An embodiment of the invention optionally provides 
for transporting the disks upon carriages accepted in the magazine and a lifter 

mechanism displacing apart disks in the magazine to allow sufficient clearance 
for access to a selected disk.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk player having a
magazine for storing disks which permits the playing of a selected disk from
the magazine, and more particularly, to a disk player having a disk reader with
a drive mechanism for clamping the selected disk and a magazine with an
alignment mechanism where both the mechanisms are driven by a common
motor.Disk players having magazines for storing disks typically provide a
selecting apparatus for transporting a selected disk from the magazine
to a disk reader or an ejection position. One such disk player is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 5,123,001. The disclosed disk player provides trays for
holding disks which are transported between ejection, playback, and storage
positions, wherein the storage position has a selected disk positioned within the
magazine. The disks are arranged concentrically within the magazine and the
magazine is driven by a vertical drive mechanism in a first direction
perpendicular to the disks and relative to a disk reader. Disks are transported
by a disk transport mechanism in a straight line in a second direction
perpendicular to the first direction. Disks in the playback position are
completely removed from the magazine and are lowered onto a turntable by
a disk clamping mechanism.A disk player which discloses multiple uses of a single motor is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 5,128,918. In that device, a single motor is used to move
disks into a disk loaded position, to detect whether the disk is in that disk loaded
position, and to rotate a reproducing unit so that it engages the disk while the
disk is in the loading position. A separate motor is needed and utilized to raise
and lower a stocker in which disks are stored.While the above designs provide for effective operation, dedicated
driving motors are required for both the vertical drive mechanism for the
magazine and the disk clamping mechanism. This type of design having a
dedicated drive source for each function increases the cost of components and 
manufacture. Furthermore, the number of parts associated with dedicated
drive sources makes it difficult to reduce a size of the disk player. Thus,
eliminating drive sources by driving more than one mechanism from a
common drive source would provide numerous advantages.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a disk player
which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art.It is a further object of the invention to provide a disk player, with a
magazine driving mechanism and a disk clamp driving mechanism
