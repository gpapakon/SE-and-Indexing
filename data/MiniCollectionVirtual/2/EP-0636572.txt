<ABSTRACT>
The jack has a head (1), a base (foot) (2), first (3, 4) and second (5, 6) pairs of link rods which are articulated to the head (1) and to the foot (2) respectively and connected together at (7) and at (8), a clevis piece (9') internal to the quadrilateral and mounted on the connected ends of the link rods (3) and (5) and an operating screw (10) mounted so that it can rotate on the connection (8) between the other two link rods (4, 6) and in a component (11') threaded in a complementary way mounted on the clevis piece. The threaded piece (11') is mounted so it can move on the clevis piece (9') between two predetermined positions separated from one another along the axis of the screw (10), at one of the said predetermined positions which is closest to the adjacent vertex of the quadrilateral defining a predetermined geometry of the jack which is appropriate for it being fitted on a spare wheel.

Lifting jack, especially for a motor vehicle,
comprising a head (1), a base (2), first (3, 4) and

second (5, 6) pairs of links articulated to the head
(1) and to the base (2), respectively, and connected

together in approximately the configuration of a convex
quadrilateral, a clevis piece mounted on the connected

ends of one link (3) of the first pair and of a link
(5) of the second pair, at one corner of the

quadrilateral, and a diagonal operating screw (10)
mounted so that it can turn, on the one hand, on the

connection (8) between the other two links (4, 6) of
these pairs at the opposite corner of the quadrilateral

and, on the other hand, in a complementarily threaded
component mounted on the clevis piece so that this

threaded component carries the load during the lifting
phase, characterized in that the said threaded

component (11') is mounted so that it can move on the
clevis piece (9', 9'') between two predetermined

positions separated from one another along the axis of
the screw (10).
Jack according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the one of the said predetermined positions which

is closest to the adjacent corner of the quadrilateral
defines a predetermined geometry of the jack which is

appropriate for installing it in a storage space.
Jack according to Claim 2, characterized in
that, in the said predetermined geometry, it can be 

installed in the space delimited by the wheel rim (12)
of a motor vehicle spare wheel.
Jack according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the threaded component (11') has

two end bearing surfaces dimensioned to slide in two
corresponding parallel buttonhole slots (13) of the

clevis piece, the ends of these buttonhole slots
defining the said predetermined positions of the

threaded component (11').
Jack according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the clevis piece (9') is

articulated about a journal (7) articulating the ends
of the two links (3, 5) that are connected to the said

clevis piece (9').
Jack according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the clevis piece is mounted on

two parallel articulation pins (15, 16), each one
coupling the end of one of the two links (3, 5) to the

said clevis piece (9'').
Jack according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the links (4, 6) connected to the corner of the

quadrilateral which is opposite the corner from which
the clevis piece (9'') protrudes are articulated to a

component (17) through which the screw (10) passes, by
means of two parallel articulation pins (18, 19)

respectively.
Jack according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the ends of at least one of the pairs of links (3,

5; 4, 6) connected to the clevis piece (9'') or to the
corner of the quadrilateral opposite this clevis piece

are positively coupled in rotation by toothed sectors
(21
