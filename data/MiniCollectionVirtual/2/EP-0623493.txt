<ABSTRACT>
A closure (10) for an air bag deployment opening 
including at least one stress concentration feature (81,62,64) 

adapted to initiate, under the influence of an 
inflating bag, tearing of the closure at a selected central 

location (80) along tear ways (40,42,44) to thereby form 
hinged doors (34,36). The stress concentration feature 

may be a centrally located acute V-shaped groove with 
adjacent more rounded grooves. Alternatively or in 

addition the stress concentration feature may be a 
reinforcing rib (62,64) extending from the selected 

opening location (80) to a hinge portion of the door (34,36). 
The rib (62,64) is 1 to 2 mm thicker than adjacent 

parts of the face portion (12) and 1.5 to 2 times thicker 
than such parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable restraint
systems and, more particularly, to an improved closure for use with
an installation of an inflatable cushion, commonly referred to as
an air bag.Safety restraint systems which self-actuate from an undeployed
to a deployed state without the need for intervention by the
operator, i.e., "passive restraint systems", and particularly those
restraint systems incorporating inflatable bags or cushions, as
well as the use of such systems in motor vehicles have been the
subjects of much discussion as the desirability of the use of such
passive restraint systems has gained general acceptance in the
United States.It is well known to protect a vehicle occupant using a cushion
or bag that is inflated with gas, e.g., an "air bag", when the
vehicle encounters sudden deceleration, such as in a collision.
During deployment, the rapidly evolving gas with which the bag is
typically filled is an inert gas, e.g., nitrogen. In such systems,
the cushion is normally housed in an uninflated and folded
condition to minimize space requirements. Upon actuation of the
air bag system, gas is discharged from an inflator to rapidly
inflate the bag. The cushion, upon inflation, serves to restrain
the movement of the vehicle occupant as the collision proceeds. In
general, such air bags are commonly designed to be inflated in no
more than about 30-60 milliseconds.Inflatable restraint systems have been devised for automotive
vehicles in which one or more air bags are stored in one or more
storage compartments within the vehicle. In general, an air bag
provided for the protection of a vehicle driver, i.e., a driver 
side air bag, is stored within a housing mounted in a storage
compartment located in the steering column of the vehicle.
Whereas, an air bag for the protection of a front seat passenger,
a passenger side air bag, is typically stored within a
housing mounted in the instrument panel/dash board of the vehicle.
In either case, the housing generally has a cover or some form of
closure panel member having a face portion to provide closure to
the opening through which the air bag will be deployed upon
actuation.In order to reduce the likelihood of tampering with the
system, the closure panel member is commonly designed so as to
minimize the visual impression of the presence of the air bag and
air bag deployment opening thereunder. Thus, such closure panel
members are typically designed to match or otherwise be compatible
with the interior design of the vehicle.Also to this end,

<CLAIMS>
A closure (10) for an air bag deployment opening of an
air bag assembly adapted to be integrated into a vehicle with

the assembly including a housing for accommodating a collapsed
inflatable air bag wherein the closure comprises:


a) a mounting portion (20) securable to the housing,
b) a face portion (12) defining therein weakened tear
ways (40, 42, 44) which tear and form release doors

(34, 36) under the influence of inflating of the air
bag, and
c) a hinge portion (50, 52) joining at least one of said
release doors (34, 36) with said mounting portion

(20) after the formation of said doors,

said closure (10) additionally comprising at least one stress
concentration feature (81, 62, 64) whereby, under the influence

of the inflating bag, an initial opening for the deployment of
the air bag is formed at a selected location (80) on said tear

ways (40, 42, 44),

   characterised in that said stress concentration feature
comprises a tear way having a V-shaped groove (81) at the

location (80) of the initial opening with said tear way (40)
having a rounded groove (87) adjacent said V-shaped groove (81).
The closure (10) according to claim 1 wherein said V-shaped
groove (81) and said rounded groove (87) tear ways are

of substantially the same thickness.
The closure (10) according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
V-shaped groove (81) tear way comprises first and second groove

side walls (82, 84) joined together at an acute angle (G).
The closure (10) according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein
said selected location (80) is centrally positioned relative to

said face portion (12) and the V-shaped groove (81) tear way at
the site of said selected location (80) extends at least about 

15 mm in both opposite directions therefrom with the rounded
groove (87) tear way adjacent said V-shaped groove (81) tear

way.
The closure (10) according to any preceding claim
wherein said stress concentration feature further comprises at

least one reinforcing rib (62, 64) extending the length of at
least one of said doors (34, 36) from the initial opening

location (80) to the hinge portion (50, 52) joining said door
(34, 36) with said mounting portion (20).
The closure (10) according to claim 5 wherein said at
least one reinforcing rib (62, 64) comprises the general shape

72) extending from said selected opening location (80) to the
cross bar section (66, 68).
