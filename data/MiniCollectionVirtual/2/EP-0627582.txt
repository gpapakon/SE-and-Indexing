<ABSTRACT>
A sealing ring (10) has an outer sealing area (11) with a sealing edge (8) which, with the seal installed, rests against the surface area to be sealed off and with a retaining area (12) situated to the inside of the sealing area (11). In order to make it more difficult for the sealing ring (10) to be pulled out of the associated slotted recess (13) or to prevent this altogether, the slotted recess (13) has at least one offset retaining shoulder (16) and the retaining area of the sealing ring (10) has at least one associated retaining edge (17), which holds the sealing ring (10) positively in the manner of a barb when the said sealing ring is installed.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing arrangement for the control piston (1) of 
a pneumatic valve (2), with a sealing ring (10) made of 

at least partially elastic material, which comprises an 
outer, substantially disk-shaped sealing region (11) with 

a sealing edge (8) resting in the fitted state against 
the surface region (3) to be sealed, and a retaining 

region (12) lying concentrically within the sealing 
region (11), and is arranged with partial prestressing in 

an associated groove-shaped recess (13) of the control 
piston (1), characterised in that the groove-shaped 

recess (13) of the control piston (1), which is 
integrally formed at least in the region of said recess 

(13), comprises a retaining shoulder (16) at least on one 
side, which retaining shoulder (16) is undercut from a 

region (14) of reduced width lying closer to the sealing 
edge (8) to a region (15) of greater width lying further 

removed from the sealing edge (8), and the retaining 
region (12) of the sealing ring (10) comprises an 

associated retaining edge (17) running at least partially 
around the circumference, which retaining edge (17) 

secures the sealing ring (10) in the groove-shaped recess 
(13) against the undercut retaining shoulder (16) in the 

fitted state of the sealing ring effected with elastic 
expansion of said sealing ring (10). 
A sealing arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the undercut retaining shoulder 

(16) is formed by the lateral surface of a lateral 
indentation (18) in the circumferential, groove-shaped 

recess (13) nearer the sealing edge (8). 
A sealing arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the undercut retaining shoulder 

(16) is formed by the side of a circumferential  
 

constriction (20) of the groove-shaped recess (13) remote 
from the sealing edge (8). 
A sealing arrangement according to one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the retaining edge (17) of 

the sealing ring (10) is constructed on a 
circumferential, lip-shaped enlarged section (21) of the 

sealing ring (10) in the retaining region (12). 
A sealing arrangement according to one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that, between the sealing region 

(11) and the retaining region (12), the sealing ring (10) 
comprises a laterally circumferential hollow (22) 

facilitating the pressing of the retaining region (12) 
together with the retaining edge (17) behind the 

retaining shoulder (16).
