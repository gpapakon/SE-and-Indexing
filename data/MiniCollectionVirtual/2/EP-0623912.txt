<ABSTRACT>
A surface with a discernible grey level being obtained by activating a certain proportion of the pixels of this surface, the screen is virtually divided into blocks of pixels all of the same dimensions, and, for each discernible grey level desired, a set of patterns is defined in advance, each representing one block, the various patterns of the same set all having the same proportion of active pixels, for example two out of sixteen for a grey of 2/16th in the scale going from white to black (20-27), but a different arrangement of the inactive pixels and of the active pixels, and, for displaying each pixel of the image, a pattern of the set corresponding to the desired grey level is selected, and the pixel is displayed with the active or inactive state of the point having the same position in the selected pattern. On each redefinition of an image, a different pattern (from 20 to 27) is chosen. Applications: static-image display devices, especially the video phone, the "Minitel", or portable computers.

A method of generating a visual appearance of different grey levels in a 
liquid crystal display screen having a passive matrix of pixels incapable of generating 

dots which are really grey but have only an active or an inactive state for each pixel, a 
surface having an apparent grey level being obtained by activating a given proportion of 

pixels, and the screen being virtually divided into pixel blocks all having the same 
dimension, while patterns of dots are defined in advance, each pattern representing a 

block and corresponding to one of the grey levels due to the fact that it has a number of 
active dots corresponding to this grey level, a pixel contained in a block of the image 

being displayed with the active or the inactive state of the dot which, in a pattern 
corresponding to the grey level desired for said pixel, has the same position as the pixel 

in the block comprising this pixel, characterized in that a set comprising a limited 
number of basic patterns is defined in advance (0+20+30+40), each pattern of a set 

comprising a number of active pixels per pattern equal to a power of two, while the 
basic patterns have such a composition that each position of an active pixel is 

exclusively utilized in a single one of the basic patterns of the set, and a pattern for 
generating a grey level not provided in the set of patterns is constructed by 

superimposing several patterns of this set. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, in which the patterns are redefined 
periodically, characterized in that an assembly of several sets of different basic patterns 

(0+20+30+40, 1+21+31+41, 2+22+32+40, 3+23+33+41, 4+24+30+40, etc.) 
is defined in advance, each of these sets complying with the rule that each position of 

an active pixel is exclusively utilized in a single one of the basic patterns of the same 
set, and the periodical redefinition of the patterns is realised by cyclically selecting all 

the sets of this assembly in turns. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that, when the same 
grey level is desired for two pixels, one of which is situated in a block and the other in 

a neighbouring block, a set of patterns is selected in different assemblies for each of 
these two pixels.  

 
A device for generating the appearance of grey levels in a liquid crystal 
display screen having a passive matrix of pixels virtually divided into pixel blocks all 

having the same dimension, comprising a wired logic circuit (42) which computes the 
state in which a pixel is to be displayed as a function of its position in a block and as a 

function of the grey level desired for this pixel, and is, to this end, provided with input 
terminals for the coordinates of a pixel and "grey" input terminals each for receiving a 

grey-level definition bit, characterized in that, with "n" being an integral number, and 
the number of "grey" input terminals (G0-G3) being n, said wired logic circuit 

comprises a circuit (38) for defining the state of the pixel which is provided with two 
sets of n coordinate input terminals (P0-P3+S0-S3) each for receiving a bit of 

coordinates of a pixel and a "black" input (N) for a bit possibly indicating whether the 
pixel is 100% black, and is constituted by n exclusive-OR gates (R0-R3) each having 

two inputs each connected to one of the coordinate input terminals (S0,P3, S1,P2, 
S2,P1, S3,P0), n AND gates (E0-E3) each having at least two inputs, one of which is 

connected to the output of one of the exclusive-OR gates and the other is connected to 

one of the "grey" input terminals (G0-G3), and an OR output gate (R9) which supplies, 
at its output (OUT), the state to be given to the pixel and has n+1 inputs, n inputs of 

which are each connected to the output of one of the AND gates and one is connected 
to the "black" input, and, by attributing a number to each of the OR gates and to each 

of the AND gates, each output of an OR gate is connected to an input of each AND 
gate of the higher number, if any. 
A device as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that it comprises, in 
series in the path of certain coordinate bits, an adder circuit (37) having two groups of n 

inputs and n outputs, one of the groups of n inputs (B0-B3) being connected to n input 
terminals for the coordinates (C2,C3,L2,L3), while n conductors (T0-T3) each 

conveying a bit indicating a number for the image are connected to the other group of n 
inputs (A0-A3), the n outputs of the adder (37) being connected to one of the sets of 

coordinate inputs of the circuit (38) for defining the state of the pixel. 
A device as claimed in any one of Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that it 
comprises, in series in the path of coordinate bits, a mixer circuit (35+36) constituted 

by logic elements modifying the coordinate bits. 
A device as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that, with the number of 
coordinate bits being even, the mixer circuit is constituted by two mixer sub-circuits  

 
(35, 36) each having n input terminals (X1,Y0,X0,Y1) for the coordinates, and n 

outputs (P0-P3), while the least significant bits (C0,C1,L0,L1) of each coordinate are 
applied to one of the sub-circuits (35) and the most significant bits (C2,C3,L2,L3) are 

applied to the other sub-circuit (36). 
A device as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that, with n being equal 
to four, each mixer sub-circuit is constituted by logic elements (R10-R14) representing 

the following Boolean equations, the four inputs being denoted X0, X1 for the 
coordinates plotted on the abscissa, Y0, Y1 for the coordinates plotted on the ordinate 

and the outputs being denoted P0-P3: 

P0 = X1 ⊕ Y0 
P1 = X0 ⊕ Y1 
P2 = X1 ⊕ Y0 ⊕ Y1 
P3 = X1 ⊕ X0
