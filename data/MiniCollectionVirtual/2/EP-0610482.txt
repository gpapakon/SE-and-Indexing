<ABSTRACT>
In a device for preparing and dispensing refreshing beverages, the latter are prepared by mixing a selected beverage concentrate among several beverage concentrates with carbonated water. The carbonated water is enriched with CO2 gas in a reservoir (5) and is cooled until the desired temperature of the beverage is achieved. The design and the operation of such a device are extended in order to enlarge the offer of beverages by arranging a branching system downstream of the pressure pump for filling the reservoir, over which water selectively and alternatively flows through the reservoir or through a bypass line that extends through the reservoir and/or is thermally well coupled thereto, down to the area next to the mixing area with the beverage concentrate.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for preparing and dispensing refreshment drinks
of one of a plurality of drink concentrates and cooled

water enriched with CO
2
 gas or cooled water not enriched
with CO
2
 gas, comprising a pressure pump (10), a branching
system (21), a shutoff valve (12) controlled depending on

the amount of water required, a refillable, cooled storage
tank (5) in which the water is enriched with CO
2
 gas,
cooling coils (17) being provided at the outside of the

storage tank (5) for cooling the storage tank (5) and for
forming an ice shell (18) inside the storage tank (5), and

a line (23, 24) for water not enriched with CO
2
 gas, which
line is cooled by thermal coupling with the storage tank

(5), the branching system (21) being arranged downstream
of the pressure pump (10) and guiding the water selectively

via the storage tank (5) or direct for mixing (1)
with the drink concentrate,
characterized
in that the cooled line is designed as a bypass line
(23, 24) with respect to the storage tank (5) and

arranged in the lower area of the storage tank (5),
in that the cooling coils (17) are arranged in the
upper portion of the storage tank (5) and offset from

the area of the bypass line (23, 24) and
in that the bypass line (23, 24) is arranged at the
outside of the storage tank (5) and/or guided through

the same.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that,
with an arrangement of the bypass line (23) at the outside 

of the storage tank (5), an icing sensor (30) and a
heating means (29) controllable by the latter are provided

in the bypass line.
Apparatus according to claims 1 or 2, characterized, in
that the bypass line guided through the storage tank (5)

is arranged within the lower portion of the storage tank
and around a circulating pump (15) arranged in the storage

tank.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
by a circulating pump (25) circulating the water

within the bypass line (23, 24).
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the
circulating pump (25) is controlled in response to the

water temperature in the bypass line (23, 24).
