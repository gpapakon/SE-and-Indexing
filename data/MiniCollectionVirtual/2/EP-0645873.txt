<ABSTRACT>
An integral induction coil (32) is used to heat the rotor (10) of an 
ECM. This provides a localized heating and dilation of the bore (13) of 

the rotor prior to the heating of the outer surface of the rotor (16). 
The crankshaft (40) is located in the heated bore (13) and acts as a 

heat sink. As a result, the outer surface of the rotor is not heated 
such as might cause the loss of magnetic properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,876,492, an electronically 
commutated motor, ECM, includes a permanent magnet rotor 
assembly. The rotor assembly has a low reluctance core 
formed as an annular cylindrical ferromagnetic member 
generally referred to as backiron. The backiron is 
surrounded by a number of thin flat angular ferromagnetic 
elements or laminations secured to the outer peripheral 
surface of the backiron so as to establish constant magnetic 
polar regions with north-south polarizations. The thin 
ferromagnetic elements are made of permanent magnetic 
material such as Alnico and are secured, as by adhesive 
bonding, to the backiron. The thin ferromagnetic elements 
are alternately polarized to provide constant magnetic polar 
regions. Where a rotor is to be directly attached to a crankshaft, or 
the like, it is common practice to heat the rotor and place 
it on the crankshaft so as to be shrunk fit thereon upon the 
cooling of the rotor. Ferromagnetic materials, however, are 
subject to the loss of their magnetic properties when heated 
to their Currie temperature. As a result, it is conventional 
to secure the rotors of ECM's by slot and key or other 
suitable means other than shrink fitting. Where one member 
is attached to another by shrink fitting, it is conventional 
to heat one of the members by an external induction coil or 
to place it in a convection oven to cause its thermal 
expansion. The heated member is placed on the other member 
and allowed to cool to a shrink fit. In such a method, the 
heated member is heated as a unit since the interior bore 
must be thermally expanded.  The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus 
for securing members together by a shrink fit. The invention 
is particularly applicable for securing the rotor of an ECM 
to a crankshaft, but is advantageous in any shrink fitting 
operation where one member is heated to permit its attachment 
to another member. Specifically, the present invention uses 
an induction coil to provide a localized heating and 
expansion of one member which can then be placed over or 
receive the other member to which it is to be shrink fit. 
Because the heating is localized, less energy is required, 
the ECM rotor magnets are not destroyed, there are no 
problems due to differential heating of dissimilar materials, 
the external surface remains cool and can be handled without 
the use of special tools. Further, because the core is 
heated by conduction between its middle and outside surface, 
thermal stresses are

Apparatus for securing two members in a shrink 
fit comprising: 

   a first one (12) of said two members having an 
opening (13) therein; 

   a second one (40) of said two members having a 
portion adapted to be located in said opening whereby said 

first and second members are secured together in a shrink 
fit; 

   induction coil means (32) adapted to be located in 
said opening for providing localized heating to said first 

member; 
   means (30) for separating said first member and 

said means for proving localized heating; 
   means (42) for locating said portion of said second 

member at ambient temperature in said opening of said first 
member while said first member is heated locally whereby said 

second member acts as a heat sink relative to said first 
member and said first member heat shrinks onto said second 

member. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said first 
member is generally cylindrical and further includes means 

(20, 21, 22) for rotating said first member to provide a 
uniform localized heating of said first member by said means 

for providing localized heating. 
Apparatus of claim 1 wherein said first member 
is a rotor for an ECM and said second member is a crankshaft 

and further including:
 

   means for separating said rotor and said means for 
heating. 
A method for securing two members in a shrink 
fit with the apparatus of claim 1 comprising the steps of: 

   locating the induction coil means within an opening 
in the first one of the two members for providing localized 

heating; 
   heating a localized portion of the first one of the 

two members; 
   separating the means for providing localized 

heating from the opening; 
   while the first one of the two members is still 

heated in a localized manner, locating a portion of the 
second one of the two members within the opening whereby the 

second one of the two members acts as a heat sink with 
respect to the first one of the two members and the first one 

of the two members shrink fits onto the second one of the two 
members.
