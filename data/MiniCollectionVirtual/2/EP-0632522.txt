<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric lens which consists of a radome (1) which is 
a dome shell, a lid (5), and a foamy body (10) produced by 

fusion-molding 
of preexpanded beads. The foamy body is mounted in 

the radome, and the radome is closed with the lid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric lens,
and more particularly to a dielectric lens used as an element
of an antenna for receiving microwave for communication and
broadcasting.A dielectric lens used as an element of an antenna
for receiving microwave of 5GHz or more is conventionally
produced by: mixing a resin, for example, polypropylene,
polyethylene, polystyrene or the like, with ceramic powder,
which acts as a foaming agent and as a dielectric constant
conditioner; and molding the mixture into a dome. In the
molding, the surface of the dielectric lens is solidified,
and a radome layer is formed. The radome layer protects the
inner foamy body from weathering and reinforces the foamy
body.In the conventional manufacturing process, the dielectric
lens is molded to be thick and accordingly to be
heavy. For example, if a mixture of polypropylene and ceramic
powder is molded into a dome which is about 180mm in 
diameter and about 76mm in height, the weight will be about
1kg. Thus, a large quantity of resin is necessary, and the
cost of the dielectric lens is high.The thickly molded dielectric lens is likely to have
a defect such as a sink mark and a swirl mark on the surface
(radome layer) and a void inside. The defect can be fairly
avoided by adopting injection compression molding. However,
the injection compression molding requires a mold of a complicated
structure and expensive facilities. Even in the
injection compression molding, it is difficult to completely
prevent occurrence of a sink mark, a swirl mark and a void.
Further, a product by the injection compression molding has
residual stress, which is a cause of deflection. WO 93/10572 relates to a dielectric material for antennas
which is composed of individual pieces which appear
essentially homogenous to signals whose frequency is such
that their wavelength is greater than the dimension of the
pieces. The dielectric material comprises some dielectrical
pieces which collectively form a dielectic block which
itself has the shape of a dielectric antenna to be produced.
The pieces may be fixed to each other, for example by
glueing, or may just lay near or on each other. A microwave
length antenna comprises a radome cover which may also serve
as a matching layer to reduce the amount of reflected signal
at the lens surface. The radome cover is made of plastic and
may be used as a vessel to contain the unbound plastic
pieces.WO 89/08932 relates to a solid dielectric lens aerial
comprising a lens of dielectric material transparent to
radiation.
