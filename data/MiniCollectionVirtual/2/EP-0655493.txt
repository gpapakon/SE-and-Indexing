<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for transforming a waste 
product, i.e. acid tar, characterised in that it 

comprises the following steps : a) acid tar is dug up 
mechanically and processed further a number of times and 

piled up ; b) the aerated acid tar is ground in a drum 
mill to a grain size of maximum 40 mm ; c) lime hydrate 

is added to the granular material ; d) the 
neutralisation process is allowed to continue for at 

least 12 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
transforming a waste product of the petrochemical
industry, i.e. acid tar, in the form of a compact mass.The invention has also as object to make said
waste products usable as component for composing a fuel
of high caloric value.By the word "acid tar" is meant a waste
product of the petrochemical industry. This waste
product has a pitch-like colour, comprises a high
percentage of oils and fats and is generally strongly
sulphurous. Acid tar has a low pH-value.Depending on the petrochemical process, the
basic product from which acid tar is a residue and the
end product, innumerable sorts of acid tar strongly
different from one another exist. Acid tar can appear
under the form of a liquid, plastic material. Acid tar
can also show a rigid consistency with strong variations
concerning the chemical composition thereof.In the following is meant as acid tar a waste
product, irrespective of appearance and chemical
composition.In practice and in general, acid tar belongs
to the waste products which are dumped in large
quantities on certain places.In document EP-A-0 076 397 is described a
method for recuperating acid tar from petroleum
fractions. Remarkable for the method described by this 
document is the addition of calcium hydroxide to
unground acid tar materials and this in a ratio of about
40% lime hydrate per quantity acid tar.Because according to the present patent
application the acid tar materials are first finely
milled, a very intimate mixing of these materials with
lime hydrate is to be expected. The exothermic reaction
is so large that this mixing may not be performed in a
drum or a similar closed space. spreading lime hydrate
occurs therefore in a next step.In order to transform this waste product now,
in conformity with the method according to the
invention, into a component which can be used in the
composition of a fuel of high caloric value, the method
according to the invention comprises :
that recited in the accompanying claims. Other details and advantages of the invention
will appear from the following description of a method
for transforming a waste product of the petrochemical
industry. This description is given by way of example
and does not limit the invention. The reference
numerals relate to the figure annexed hereto.The unique figure is a schematic
representation to illustrate the method according to the
invention.Acid tar 1 is dug up on the spot and processed
a number of times and piled up into piles 2. Processing
the acid tar which has been dug

<CLAIMS>
Method for transforming a compact
mass of acid tar, characterised in that said method comprises the steps of:


a) mechanically digging up acid tar with a digging machine, mechanically
processing said acid tar for several times, possibly with the same digging

machine, and putting said acid tar into piles,
b) processing the thus obtained aerated tar once more by grinding the tar
in a drum mill until the ground tar has a grain size of maximum 40 mm
c) neutralising the ground tar for at least 12 hours by adjusting the pH of
the ground tar to at least 6 by adding lime hydrate
d) adding to the neutralised tar a fine grained material chosen from the
group of wood waste, paper or plastics waste material in the milled or shredded form.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the lime hydrate is added to the dug up tar in such a

way that the exothermic reaction which occurs during the mixing of the acid
tar with the lime hydrate progresses gradually at a temperature of below

100Â°C.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that lime hydrate is added in the form of slaked lime.
Method as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the neutralised tar is mixed and calibrated

until the end product shows a grain size of up to about maximum 10 mm.
