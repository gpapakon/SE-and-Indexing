<ABSTRACT>
A facial support mask (10) supports the face of a patient in the prone position during surgical procedures in spaced relation above a support surface. The mask has a plurality of transversely spaced longitudinal crescent arms (14); at least one cross-strut (12) interconnected with the longitudinal crescent arms; an inflatable chamber (16) attached to the crescent arms and adapted to contact the patient's forehead and sides of his face; securement strap for securing the mask to the patient's face. The mask may also include an integral secretion collection dish. The method includes: anesthetizing the patient; placing the mask on the patient's face such that no part of the mask contacts the patient's eyes, nose or lips; securing the mask to the patient's face; rolling the patient onto the prone position; adjusting the inflation of the chamber; adjusting the patient's head orientation; and draining any patient secretions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONSURGICALFACEMASKSUPPORTAPPARATUSANDMETHOD Technical FieldThe apparatus and method of the invention relate generally to the performance of surgical procedures. More specifically, they relate to an apparatus and method for protecting a patient's face during surgical procedures performed in the prone (face down) position while resting on a support surface.It is well known in the art that a patient is especially vulnerable to facial injury when surgery is performed in the prone position. The nose, certain nerves, and especially the eyes are all at risk of compression injury any time an anesthetized patient is resting on his or her face during surgery. It is thus critically important that some means be provided for supporting the patient's head in a manner that protects the sensitive areas from any pressure during the surgical procedure. Description of the Prior ArtExisting techniques for supporting the patient's head and protecting the face during prone-position procedures are generally unreliable and potentially ineffective. Commonly, anesthesiologists will use foam rubber donuts and stacks of small towels to support the head. However, the doctor frequently is operating in the blind, not knowing for certain the eyes and nose are not being subjected to pressure, since the position of the nose, mouth, or eyes can not be verified visually by the physician once the donut and towels have been installed.Another prior art technique is to use a pair of pads connected by plastic arms with the forehead and chin resting on the pads. A major problem with this technique is that the total weight of the head is distributed on only these two points. This may cause skin sloughing at these two points.An additional problem with prior art devices is their inability to provide for adjustment of the patient's head relative to the torso and support surface. Generally, these prior art devices limit the patient's head position to the"neutral" or centerline position. It is generally desirable 

however that a patient's head be adjustable relative to the torso and support surface to accommodate different surgical techniques and procedures.A further limitation of prior art devices are their lack of any provision for the collection and draining away of any patient secretions during the surgical procedure. All patients to varying degrees "drool" during surgical procedures. Additionally, and of more concern, patients will often drain mucus or blood during the procedure. This is potentially hazardous to operating room

<CLAIMS>
I claim:
1. A facial support mask for supporting the face of a patient in the prone position during surgical procedures, in a spaced relation above a support surface comprising:
an inflatable chamber adapted to contact the patient's forehead and sides of his face;
a solid dish having a drainage hole wherein said solid dish is curved in order to generally conform to a user's face such that it may roll on a supporting surface,
attachment means for attaching said dish directly to said inflatable chamber at a position for collection of fluid from said patient's face while said patient is supported in said prone position; and
securement means for securing said mask and dish directly to the patient's face wherein the patient's face is maintained in a spaced relation from the support surface.
2. The invention of claim 1 wherein said inflatable chamber is generally "C" shaped.
3. The invention of claim 2 wherein said dish is constructed of a generally clear material. 


 4. A facial support mask for supporting the face of a patient in the prone position during surgical procedures, in a spaced relation above a support surface comprising:
a plurality of transversely spaced longitudinal crescent arms;
\
at least one cross-strut interconnected with said longitudinal crescent arms;
a solid dish having a drainage hole therein and adapted to be placed adjacent said longitudinal crescent arms and cross- struts and operative to collect and drain any accumulated patient secretions;
an inflatable chamber adapted to contact the patient's forehead and sides of his face;
attachment means for attaching said inflatable chamber to said crescent arms; and
securement means for securing said mask to the patient's face;
any adjacent pair of crescent arms being selectively engagable with the support surface to maintain the patient's head in spaced relation from the support surface, and to selectively fix the angle of the patient's head relative to the support surface. 


 5. The invention of claim 4 wherein said cross strut is generally perpendicular to said crescent arms.
6. The invention of claim 5 wherein said inflatable chamber is generally "C" shaped.
7. The invention of claim 6 wherein said dish is constructed of a clear material.
8. The invention of claim 7 wherein said dish is constructed of a clear material. 

9. A facial support mask for supporting the face of a patient in the prone position during surgical procedures in a spaced relation above a support surface comprising:
a plurality of transversely spaced longitudinal crescent arms;
at least one cross-strut interconnected with said longitudinal crescent arms;
a generally lenticular shaped dish integrally formed with said longitudinal crescent arms and cross-strut and having interior and exterior surfaces, said crescent arms and cross-strut forming troughs in the interior surface of said dish and ridges on the exterior surface thereof;
an inflatable chamber adapted to contact the patient's forehead and sides of his face;
attachment means for attaching said inflatable chamber to said crescent arms; and
securement means for securing said mask to the patient's face;
any adjacent pair of crescent arms being selectively engagable with the support surface to maintain the patient's head in spaced relation from rhe support surface, and to selectively fix the angle of the patient's head relative to the support surface. 


 10. The invention cf claim 9 wherein said dish is constructed of clear plastic material.
11. The invention of claim 10 wherein the attachment means is an attachment plate attached to said dish and operative to secure said inflatable chamber to said lenticular shaped dish.
