<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a signalling converter for processing switching information with a protection circuit to limit a current (Ic) flowing in a telephone switching wire (c). It is proposed to provide an evaluation circuit (OP, 6) in the protection circuit which effects an opening of a switch (7) disposed in series with the telephone switching wire (c) when a signal (U) derived from this current (Ic) exceeds a threshold value (U0). Through a design of the invention, the current (Ic) is limited even if the current (Ic) assumes unacceptably high values for a short time only and does not effect an opening of the switch (7).

Signalling converter for processing switching
information having a protection circuit for limiting a

current (Ic) flowing in a telephone switching line (c),
characterized in that the protection circuit contains

an evaluation circuit (OP, 6) which causes a switch (7)
arranged in series with the telephone switching line

(c) to open if a signal (U) derived from this current
(Ic) reaches a threshold value (U0).
Signalling converter according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the evaluation circuit (OP, 6)

contains a comparator (OP) at one input of which a
threshold voltage (U0) is present and at whose other

input a voltage (U) derived from the current (Ic) in
the telephone switching line (c) is present.
Signalling converter according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that a first resistor (R1), whose

voltage (U) is present at the input of the evaluation
circuit (OP, 6), is arranged in series with the switch

(7).
Signalling converter according to one of Claims
1 to 3, characterized in that a microprocessor (6),

which is in particular also provided for other
functions of the signalling converter, is part of the

evaluation circuit (OP, 6).
Signalling converter according to one of Claims
1 to 4, characterized in that a control voltage (Us)

generated by the evaluation circuit (OP, 6) is present
at the series circuit of a second resistor (R2), a 

diode (D) and a third resistor (R3), in that the
connection point between the second resistor (R2) and

the diode (D) is connected to the control input of the
switch (7) which is implemented by means of at least

one bipolar transistor (T1, T2), and in that the first
resistor (R1) is arranged on the contact gap side of

the switch (7) facing away from the telephone switching
line (C), and the connection point between the first

resistor (R1) and the contact gap is connected to the
control input of the switch (7).
