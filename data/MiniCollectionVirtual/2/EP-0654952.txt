<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to base stations, to methods
for assigning channels at a base station, and to mobile
switching centers.Wireless communication networks are typically
comprised of a mobile switching center, base stations and
mobile/portable units ("mobile units"). The base stations
are typically hardwired to the mobile switching center
through communication lines such as optical communication
lines. Each base station provides coverage for mobile
units within a specified area called a "cell".When a mobile unit is within a particular cell and
requests access, the base station for that cell assigns a
frequency channel pair to the mobile unit. The frequency
channel pair is comprised of an "uplink" frequency channel
which is used for transmitting signals from the mobile
unit to the base station, and a "downlink" frequency
channel, which is used for receiving signals at the mobile
unit from the base station. The frequency channel pair
assigned to a particular mobile unit can be thought of as
a single frequency channel and is often described as such
by those skilled in the art. A mobile unit, such as a
cellular telephone, can communicate with other mobile
units or hardwired units, through its communications with
a base station.The use of mobile unit wireless communication devices
such as cellular telephones, Personal Communications
Networks (PCN), wireless Private Branch Exchanges (PBX's),
and wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) is rapidly 
increasing. However, the radio frequency spectrum which
is used in wireless communications is essentially
comprised of a finite number of frequency channels.
Various channel allocation techniques have been employed
for the efficient use of this limited resource.Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) is a broad title for
several techniques for efficiently using the radio
frequency spectrum. In DCA techniques, channel pairs are
not preassigned to base stations.Present DCA techniques can be grouped into two
categories: traffic adaption and interference adaptation.
"Timid", "Aggressive", and "m-Persistent Polite
Aggressive" ("m-PPA") systems are examples of interference
adaptation techniques. These techniques are also called
distributed techniques because they allow mobile units to
make decisions concerning channel allocation.In a "Timid" technique a mobile unit measures the
interference signal level on a channel pair and seizes
that channel pair if the level indicates that no mobile
units within a certain area, called a "neighborhood", are
using that channel pair. In an
