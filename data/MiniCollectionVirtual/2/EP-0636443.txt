<ABSTRACT>
An oscillating device (6) is secured 
to the lower end of a column (2) 

in a die sinking electrical discharge apparatus 
(1), and an electrode holder (7) is 

mounted to the oscillating device (6) for 
holding a tool electrode (3). The oscillating 

device (6) comprises a block (8) of a 
material having a suitable elasticity, and 

right and left piezo-electric devices (9a, 
9b) embedded in the block (8) in a pre-loaded 

condition. These piezo-electric 
devices (9a, 9b) are alternately driven to 

impart movements to the tool electrode 
(3) such that it repeats a displacement in 

a predetermined direction and in a substantially 
reverse direction at a substantilly 

short cycle, which displacement is 
substantially smaller than a spacing between 

the tool electrode (3) and a workpiece 
(5) during processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of 
a profiling electrical discharge machining apparatus 
which generates electrical discharge between a tool 
electrode and a workpiece in a machining fluid, thereby 
machining the workpiece by removing the material. Profiling electrical discharge machining is a 
machining method in which machining is carried out with 
electrical discharge generated between a tool electrode 
and a workpiece in a machining fluid while they are 
moved relatively. In this case, tailings, decomposition 
products from the machining fluid or bubbles are 
produced in an electrical discharge gap between the tool 
electrode and the workpiece. These tailings and the 
like cause abnormal electrical discharge, and make it 
hard to maintain a satisfactory electrical discharge 
state, so that they must be quickly removed from the 
electrical discharge gap. Conventionally, these tailings and the like are 
removed by a method in which the tool electrode is 
jumped in order to urge the machining fluid to flow in 
the electrical discharge gap, or by injection of the 
machining fluid or introduction of a jet into the 
electrical discharge gap, or suction of the machining 
fluid existent in the electrical discharge gap. According to a method in which the tool electrode 
is subjected to the jumping motion, the electrical 
discharge machining has to be suspended during the 
jumping motion, which entails a negative effect such as  
 
the slowdown of the machining rate. In the case of the 
method in which the machining fluid is jetted out into 
the electrical discharge gap, the jet flow may be 
uneven, thereby sometimes causing uneven consumption of 
the tool electrode and uneven machining speed for the 
workpiece, which entails poor machining accuracy. As 
the depth of machining increases, moreover, it becomes 
hard to exert the influence of the injection upon the 
whole area of the electrical discharge gap. In the case 
where the jetting or suction of the machining fluid is 
utilized, furthermore, holes for the machining fluid 
jetting or ejection must be formed in the tool electrode 
or the workpiece before starting the electrical 
discharge machining, so that the working conditions are 
adversely restricted. Besides the above methods, there is so-called 
rocking machining process, that is, a method in which 
the tailings and the like are prevented from remaining 
in a specific location by controlling servo feed of the 
tool electrode for movement in multiple directions, that 
is, the
