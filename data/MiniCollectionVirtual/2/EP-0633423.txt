<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a pressure regulator (1) for low pressure delivery of 
gases from a high pressure source. The regulator comprises a gas inlet (2) and 

a gas outlet (3) defining a gas path (4) therebetween. A regulating element (5) 
is disposed downstream of the inlet and remote from the gas path (4). The 

device also includes heat exchange means (15) in the form of a powered heater 
or non-powered ambient heater disposed intermediate the gas inlet (2) and the 

regulating element (5). The regulating element (5) is resiliently displaceable in 
response to gas pressure and mechanically connected to operate a valve (6) at 

the gas inlet (2) to thereby regulate the gas pressure at the gas outlet (3). The 
regulator of the invention can advantageously be used in a gas distribution 

system delivering gaseous fumigant from a high pressure source such as a 
cylinder of fumigant in a liquified COâ‚‚ base, the regulator providing a sensitive 

and accurate pressure regulation that is more robust and less prone to blockage 
than most of the prior art devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas pressure regulators particularly suited for 
low pressure delivery of liquifiable and permanent gases from a high pressure 
source. The invention has been developed primarily for the controlled delivery of 
liquifiable gases or gas mixtures such as CO2 or CO2 based preparations, 
examples of which include CO2 based pesticidal formulations. However, it will 
be appreciated that the invention may be used to regulate the delivery of many 
other types of gases, both liquifiable and non liquifiable. Gaseous pesticidal preparations having a CO2 base are particularly useful for 
fumigating grain storage silos. However, numerous problems have been 
encountered when trying to regulate the delivery of such gas products. One 
reason is because the product is stored in the liquid state under high pressures 
of around 5000 kPa and is preferably delivered at a significantly lower delivery 
pressure of around 10 to 100 kPa. Operational problems are usually encountered when using conventional pressure 
regulating devices to deliver gaseous products of this kind, particularly with 
gases such as CO2. This is due to the severe pressure and temperature changes 
that occur on delivery as well as the associated volumetric expansion caused 
by the resultant gasification of the liquid gas. Whilst the severity of these 
effects will alter with various gases, they will nonetheless be present in the low 
pressure delivery of almost any gas from a high pressure source. In the prior art, pressure regulation of such preparations was usually achieved 
via control valves for high flow rate applications and special purpose regulators 
for lower flow rate installations. However, neither of these devices are generally 
able to maintain an even pressure when regulating liquified gases to a gaseous 
state. In such cases dry ice tends to form at the valve seat causing "spitting" 
and the output tends to fluctuate wildly due to the large gaseous volume 
increases and the irregularity of the flow. It should also be noted that the use of 
control valves with the necessary associated control equipment is a relatively 
high cost option.  
 Furthermore, as these various prior art regulating devices are usually designed to operate 
in-line, the componentry of the device is subjected directly to the variations in temperature 
and volumetric changes referred to above, and as such may have a reduced life span due to 
these changes. Another problem associated with the regulation and delivery of preparations such
