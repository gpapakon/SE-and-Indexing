<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an electric power steering 
device, capable of preventing damage in the power transmission 

path with a simple configuration. 
A power transmission device, having a 
frictional face (133) and a pressure member (131) pressed to 

the frictional face (133), is provided between the rotary 
shaft (130) of a motor (102) and a reducing mechanism (103a,104), so that 

the power transmission is achieved utilizing a 
frictional force generated between the frictional 

face (133) and the pressure member (131), before the output 
torque of the motor (102) is amplified by the reducing 

mechanism (103a,104). Consequently the power transmission 
device can be made simpler and compacter in 

configuration, as it is not necessary to increase 
the pressing force of the pressure member nor to 

increase the area of the frictional face (133).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric
power steering device, and more particularly, but not
exclusively, to an electric power steering device for
a vehicle.An electric power steering device for a vehicle
is known in which the output speed of an electric
motor, providing auxiliary steering torque, is reduced
by means of gears in a power transmission mechanism,
thereby transmitting an appropriate torque at
appropriate speed to an output shaft of the steering
device. While such a device is in use, an abrupt force
received by the wheels from the road may result in an
impact load acting against the output of the electric
motor, and such an impact load may cause damage to the
electric motor or to the power transmission mechanism.For reducing or avoiding such an impact load,
there have conventionally been provided, for example:
1) a slidable friction mechanism provided on
the output shaft of the steering device and serving as
a torque limiter causing a sliding motion under an
excessive torque (Utility Model Application JP-A-475506);
or 2) a magnetic clutch serving as a torque
limiter, provided on a rotary shaft of the electric
motor.However, in such conventional electric power
steering devices;
in the configuration mentioned at 1) above,
because the output of the electric motor is
transmitted to the output shaft ordinarily through a
reduction (torque increasing) gear mechanism, the
frictional force in the slidable mechanism attached to
the output shaft has to be rather large in order to
transmit increased torque. For this reason it is
associated with the drawback of requiring a strict
load control in order to obtain a constant frictional
force; andin the configuration mentioned at 2) above, the
magnetic clutch requires a constant supply of electric
power. For this reason it is associated with drawbacks
in terms of energy saving, and the solenoid of the
magnetic clutch has to be made rather large if the
rated output of the electric motor increases.EP-A-0535422 discloses an electric power steering
device comprising: 
a housing;a motor with a rotary shaft, mounted to said
housing;an output shaft connected to a wheel steering
mechanism;a reduction gear mechanism connected to said
output shaft, and provided with a transmission shaft,
said mechanism being adapted to effect power
transmission from said transmission shaft to said
output shaft; andpower transmission means disposed between the
rotary shaft of said motor and said reduction gear
mechanism;said power transmission means including a
friction plate

<CLAIMS>
An electric power steering device (100)
comprising:


a housing (101);
a motor (102) with a rotary shaft (102c), mounted
to said housing (101);
an output shaft (113) connected to a wheel
steering mechanism;
a reduction gear mechanism (103a, 104) connected
to said output shaft (113), and provided with a

transmission shaft (103), said mechanism being adapted
to effect power transmission from said transmission

shaft (103) to said output shaft (113); and
power transmission means (231, 232, 233, 234)
disposed between the rotary shaft (102c) of said motor

(102) and said reduction gear mechanism (103a, 104); 
said power transmission means including a
friction plate (231) which is incapable of rotation

relative to one of said rotary shaft (102c) and said
transmission shaft (103) but axially moveable relative

thereto, and a pressure member (232) for pressing said
friction plate (231) against a receiving means (233,

234) for receiving a pressing force from said pressure
member, which receiving means is incapable of rotation

relative to the other of said rotary shaft (102c) and
said transmission shaft (103);
power transmission being achieved, in use, by
means of a frictional force generated between said

friction plate and said receiving means (233, 234);

characterised in that said frictional force is
selected so as to be larger than the drive normally

transmitted from said motor (102) but smaller than a
predetermined value of impact load generated between

said output shaft (113) and said motor (102); and
said receiving means (233, 234) includes a
friction plate housing (233) surrounding said friction

plate (231) and said pressure member (232) such that
the pressing force from said pressure member (232) is

not transmitted outwardly from said friction plate
housing (233).
