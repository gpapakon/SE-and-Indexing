<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A bidirectional transceiver arrangement is specified which can be implemented in a more compact manner compared to a bidirectional transceiver arrangement which has already been proposed and which has two optical lenses and a separate wavelength-selective filter. 2.2 For this purpose, the bidirectional transceiver arrangement has, instead of the two lenses and the separate filter, a single plane-convex lens (3) on whose plane lens surface (31) the wavelength-selective filter (5) is arranged in the shape of a dielectric multilayer, which filter does not transmit the first wavelength ( lambda 1) emitted by the transmitter (1) and does transmit the second wavelength ( lambda 2) received by the receiver (2). 2.3 Use in customer access networks.

Bidirectional optical transceiver arrangement,
comprising


an optical transmitter (1) with a transmitter
window (10) for emitting optical radiation of a first

wavelength (λ
1
),
an optical receiver (2) with a receiver
window (20) for receiving optical radiation of a second

wavelength (λ
2
), which eminates from a specific point in
space (40) which is at a distance both from the

transmitter window (10) and from the receiver window
(20), and
a single planar convex optical lens (3) with
a convex lens surface (32) facing both the transmitter

window (10) and the specific point in space (40), and a
plane lens surface (31) facing the receiver window

(20), and
a wavelength-selective optical filter (5)
which is constructed on the plane lens surface (31) and

is opaque to the first wavelength (λ
1
) and transparent
only to the second wavelength (λ

that

the transmitter (1), the specific point in space (40),
the receiver (2) and the lens (3) are arranged relative

to one another in such a way, and the lens (3) is
dimensioned such that


the transmitter window (10) is projected onto
the specific point in space (40) solely by the lens (3) 

with reflection of the radiation of the first
wavelength (λ
1
) at the plane lens surface (31), and
the specific point in space (40) is projected
onto the receiver window (20) solely by the lens (3),

with passage of the radiation of the second wavelength
(λ
2

Arrangement according to Claim 1, in which

the convex lens surface (32) is part of a
spherical surface whose centre (320) lies essentially

on the plane lens surface (31), and in which
the transmitter (1), the receiver (2), the
lens (3) and the point in space (40) are arranged

relative to the one another in such a way that an axial
beam (11) of the radiation of the first wavelength (λ
1
)
emitting from the transmitter window (10), and an axial

beam (21) of the radiation of the second wavelength (λ
2
)
emitting from the point in space (40) in each case

impinge perpendicularly on the spherical convex lens
surface (32).
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, in which
the optical transmitter (1) comprises a laser diode

having a strip-type optical waveguide (122) which is
integrated on a surface (121) of a substrate (12) and

contains lasing material and which has an end face
which faces the lens (3) and defines the transmitter

window (10).
Arrangement according to Claim 3, in which the
surface (121) of the substrate (12) is arranged

perpendicular to a plane containing the axial beam
(11), reflected at the plane lens surface (32), of the

radiation of the first wavelength (λ

Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, in which
the receiver window (20) is arranged in a plane (22)

which is parallel to the plane lens surface (31), and
on which the axial beam (21), refracted at the plane

lens surface (31), of the radiation of the second
wavelength (λ
2

Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, in which
the receiver window (20) is arranged in a plane (22)

which is perpendicular to a plane containing the axial
beam (21) refracted at the plane lens surface (31), of

the radiation of the second wavelength (λ

Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, in which the receiver window (20) is arranged

in a plane (22) which is at an oblique angle to the
plane lens surface (31) and on which the axial beam

(21), refracted at the plane lens surface (31), of the
second wavelength (λ
2
) impinges obliquely.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, in which the lens (3) is fastened on a plate

(7) transparent to the radiation of the second
wavelength (λ
2
) in such a way that the plane lens
surface (31) faces a plate surface (71) of this plate

(7), and the filter (5) is located between this plane
surface (71) of the plate (7) and the plane lens

surface (31), and in that the receiver (2) is arranged
opposite a plane surface (71) of the plate (7) which is

averted from another plane surface (72) of the plate
(7).
Arrangement according to Claim 8, in which the
plate (7) is supported on a housing base (81) of a

housing (8) in such a way that the other plane surface
(72) of the plate (7) faces the housing base (81) and

in space (40), and for passage of the radiation of the

second wavelength ((λ
