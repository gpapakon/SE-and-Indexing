<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for efficient multimedia data 
interchange which utilizes multimedia pacing in a distributed 

data processing system. During a multimedia communications 
session, each of a plurality of receiving stations transmits 

multimedia pacing requests to a sending station at negotiated 
set time intervals. The multimedia pacing request includes 

information on the availability of current storage for 
multimedia data at the receiving station, a minimum data time 

remaining in storage in the receiving station and other 
information pertaining to the interchange of the multimedia 

data. The sending station then allocates various priorities 
to the transmission of data to the plurality of receiving 

stations in an order indicative of the type of data, i.e. 
multimedia or non-multimedia, and the information in the 

multimedia pacing request pertaining to the minimum data time 
remaining in storage at the receiving station. In addition, 

the sending station periodically determines the availability 
of the transmission queue. When the transmission queue is 

not readily available, the sending station transfers only 
high priority multimedia data to the transmission queue; 

however when the transmission queue is available, the sending 
station transfers lower priority multimedia data to the 

transmission queue as well. The sending station can then 
supply a plurality of receiving stations with significant 

multimedia data in advance when the communications interface 
is not overloaded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to improved
methods for interchanging data within a distributed data
processing system and in particular to improved methods for
interchanging multimedia and non-multimedia data within a
distributed data processing system.The interchange of data within a distributed data
processing system is a well known feature of modern state-of-the-art
computer systems. Text and graphics may be
efficiently interchanged between data processing facilities
utilizing well known modem devices or facsimile
devices/cards.Recently, modern computer systems have begun to
experiment in so-called "multimedia" data. That is,
presentations containing audio, video, text, graphics and
image combined into a common presentation. One problem
encountered in the interchange of such multimedia data in a
distributed data processing system is the communications
interface. The communications interface is frequently the
performance constraint in computer systems which support
multimedia sources with multiple communications sessions.
Several types of communications interfaces which may be
utilized in a distributed data processing system include:
Local Area Networks (LAN), Wide Area Networks (WAN), and
System Bus. Examples of each type of communications
interface are listed below. Local Area Networks (LANs): Token Ring, Ethernet, FDDI,
wireless LAN, etc. between the multimedia data sender and the
receiving station.Wide Area Networks (WAN): ISDN, etc. between the
multimedia data sender and the receiving station.System Bus: Multimedia systems store multimedia data on
some type of storage, then when a receiving station requests
multimedia data, the data is retrieved from the storage and
sent across the system bus to some type of communications
interface to the receiving station.Currently, a system which transmits multimedia data to
a receiving station across a communications interface sends
the data at a preselected rate (bytes or frames per second)
based on the type of multimedia data and compression
algorithm. This approach, called isochronous transmission,
will allocate predictable multimedia data transmission rates
for each multimedia session. The receiving station in such
an approach assumes the multimedia data arrives at the same
rate at which it should be presented to the user at the
receiving station.For example, if a receiving station and a remote sending
station choose to communicate with each other across a
communications interface, the receiving station and the
remote sending station negotiate a

A method in a distributed data processing system for the
interchange of multimedia data and non-multimedia data

between a plurality of receiving stations and a sending
station, wherein said sending station contains a

transmission queue, said method comprising the steps of:

transmitting (150, 172) from one of the plurality of the
receiving stations to the sending station, at selected

time intervals, a multimedia pacing request containing a
parameter indicating a minimum multimedia data time

remaining for storing received multimedia data within
said one of the plurality of the receiving stations;
periodically determining (52, 56, 60) an availability of
said transmission queue within said sending station;
allocating (102, 104) a high priority to multimedia data
corresponding to the transmission towards a receiving

station having sent a low value parameter;
allocating (102) lower priorities to multimedia data
corresponding to the transmissions towards a receiving

station having sent a large value parameter;
when said transmission queue is not available,
transferring (54, 112) to said transmission queue the

high priority multimedia; and,
when said transmission queue is available, transferring
(54, 58, 62, 112) to said transmission queue the high

priority and lower priority multimedia data.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of
negotiating said selected time interval between said

sending station and one of said plurality of receiving
stations prior to said interchange of said multimedia

data and said non-multimedia data. 
The method of claim 1 or 2 characterized in that it
further comprises the initial step of creating a buffer

(146) with a predetermined capacity for storing received
multimedia data at one of said plurality of receiving

stations.
A distributed data processing system for the interchange
of multimedia data and non-multimedia data between a

plurality of receiving stations and a sending station,
wherein said sending station contains a transmission

queue, said distributed data processing system
characterized in that it comprises:


transmitting means for transmitting, from one of said
plurality of receiving stations to said sending station,

at selected time intervals, a multimedia pacing request
containing a parameter indicating a minimum multimedia

data time remaining for storing received multimedia data
within said one of the plurality of the receiving

means for periodically determining an availability of
said transmission queue in said sending station;
means for allocating a high priority to multimedia data
corresponding to the transmission towards a receiving

station having sent a low value parameter and for
allocating lower priorities to multimedia data

corresponding to the transmissions towards a receiving
station having sent a large value parameter;
means for transferring to said transmission queue, when
said transmission queue is not available, the high

available, the high priority and lower priority

data.
