<ABSTRACT>
A radiation-source unit is described which produces a radiation beam (30) 
with two components (9, 10) which are polarised perpendicularly relative to one another 

and which have different frequencies. The unit comprises a radiation source, a beam 
splitter (4), an acousto-optical modulation system (13, 18) for generating the frequency 

difference, and a beam combiner (25). Since the beam splitter and the beam combiner 
are transmission elements and their connecting line extends through the centre of the 

modulation system the unit is compact and no alignment problems occur. Moreover, the 
frequency difference is adjustable over a wide range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radiation source unit for producing a radiation beam
having two components which are polarised perpendicularly to one another and which have
different frequencies, which unit comprises a radiation source for producing a radiation beam,,
a polarisation-sensitive beam splitter for splitting said beam in two linearly polarised sub-beams
having mutually perpendicular directions of polarisations, an acousto-optical
modulation system for generating a frequency difference between the sub-beams and a
polarisation-sensitive beam combiner for recombining the sub-beams emerging from the
modulation system to one beam having the said two components.The invention also relates to an interferometer and to a device for detecting
the position of two objects relative to one another, both provided with such a radiation-source
unit. The invention further relates to an apparatus for projecting a mask onto a
substrate, comprising such an interferometer and/or such a position-detection device.The article "Displacement measurement with a laser interferometer" in
"Philips' Technical Review", Vol. 30 (1969), pp. 160-166, describes an interferometric
displacement measuring device whose radiation-source unit is a so-called Zeeman laser.
Such a laser comprises, for example, a single-mode He-Ne laser, across which a magnetic
field is applied in the longitudinal direction. As a result, the laser generates two opposite
circularly polarised modes having different optical frequencies instead of a single linearly
polarised mode.However, a Zeeman laser can deliver only a limited power, which is
particularly disadvantageous in more recent applications in which the laser beam is to be
split into more than two beams. Moreover, a Zeeman laser is comparatively expensive
and very sensitive to optical feedback, which means that radiation reflected into the laser
from the optical measuring system may cause variations in amplitude and frequency of the
emitted laser beam, which may affect the measurement result. In addition, the frequency
difference between the two mutually perpendicularly polarised components is at the most 
2 MHz, so that the Zeeman laser is suitable only for measuring limited distances or
limited speeds.U.S. Patent 5,191,465 describes a radiation-source unit specially intended
for aligning a mask relative to a substrate in an opto-lithographic apparatus for imaging
the mask on the substrate. This radiation-source unit comprises a laser, a neutral beam
splitter, a separate acousto-optical modulator in
