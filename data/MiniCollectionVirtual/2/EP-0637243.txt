<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a substantially pure aminosterol 
antibiotic which can be isolated from the tissues of the common 
dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias.Over the past several years, antibiotic agents have been 
isolated from a wide range of animal species. These agents are 
believed to play a role in the innate immunity of an animal 
(Boman, H.G., Cell65, 205-207 (1991)), and comprise a variety 
of antibiotic substances used in defense against environmental 
microbes. In certain physiological settings antibiotics are 
discharged onto epithelial surfaces (Bevins, C.L. et al., Annu. 
Rev. Biochem.59, 395-414 (1990); Samakovlis, C., et al., EMBO 
J.10, 163-169 (1991); Nicolaides, N., Science, 19-26 (1974)), 
secreted into internal body fluids (Boman, H.G., et al., Annu. 
Rev. Microbial.41, 103-126 (1987)), or utilized within the 
vacuoles of phagocytic defensive cells (Lehrer, R.I., Cell64, 
229-230 (1991)). To date, only a limited number of low 
molecular weight antibiotics have been identified in animals, 
including peptides (Steiner, H. et al., Nature292, 246-248 
(1981); Ganz, T., et al., J. Cin. Invest.76, 1427-1435 
(1985); Zasloff, M., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA84, 5449-5453 
(1987)), bacteriostatic alkaloids (Daly, J.W. et al., Toxicon25, 1023-1095 (1987); Preusser, H.J., et al., Toxicon13, 285-289 
(1975)), and lipids (Kabara, J.J., Lipids12, 653-659 
(1987); Bibel, D.J. et al., J. Invest. Dermatol.92, 632-638 
(1989); Tiffany, J.M. et al., Lipid Res. (eds. Paoletti, R. and 
Kritchevsky, D.) 22, 1-62 (1987); Brissette, J.L. et al., J. 
Biol. Chem.261, 6338-6345 (1986).  
 It has now been found that the stomach of the dogfish 
shark, Squalus acanthias, contains abundant amounts of a non-peptidyl 
broad spectrum antibiotic, active against gram-positive 
and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. 
Structural determination of the antibiotic, 
(3β-[3-[4-amino-n-but-1-ylamino]-n-prop-1-ylamino]-7α, 24ζ-dihydroxy-5α-cholestane 24-sulphate), reveals it to be an amphipathic cationic steroid, 
characterized by a condensation of a bile salt intermediate 
with spermidine, having the structure (in its fully ionized 
form): 
This invention, therefore, relates to substantially 
homogenous compositions of the compound of formula I, to 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of formula 
I, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective 
antibiotic amount of the compound of formula I or a salt 
thereof, and to methods of treating microbial infections in 
human or non-human animals
