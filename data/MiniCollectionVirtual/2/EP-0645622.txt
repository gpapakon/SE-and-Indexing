<ABSTRACT>
The improved DNA base sequencer comprises a flat plate 
type gel electrophoretic means that has a multiple of tracks 

for electrophoresing DNA fragments and which is held in a 
vertical position, a light exciting laser light applying means 

that applies laser light to the respective tracks in said 
electrophoretic means from one lateral side thereof in such a 

way that it crosses said tracks at right angles, and a 
fluorescence detecting means that detects the fluorescence as 

generated from the DNA fragments illuminated with the laser 
light and which converts the detected fluorescence to an 

electric signal, and it is characterized in that the 
fluorescence detecting means comprises an index-distributed 

lens array, a filter and a solid-state imaging device such as 
a CCD line sensor. This apparatus uses light-receiving optics 

that does not include a large and expensive optical device 
such as an image intensifier and which yet is capable of 

efficient fluorescence detection without "smiling" and other 
adverse effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a DNA base sequencer, or an 
apparatus for determining the base sequences of DNA. More 
particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus with 
which the base sequences of DNA can be determined by 
fluorescent labelling in an efficient and rapid manner. Gel electrophoresis is practiced extensively as a 
technique for determining the base sequences of DNA and other 
proteins. Conventionally, the sample to be subjected to 
electrophoresis is labelled with a radioisotope for analysis 
but this method has had the problem of being painstaking and 
time-consuming. Furthermore, the use of radioactive 
substances always calls for utmost safety and management and 
analysis cannot be performed in areas other than facilities 
that clear certain regulations. Under the circumstances, a 
method that uses fluorophores to label the sample and which 
detects fluorescences as emitted upon irradiation with light 
is being reviewed. In this method, fluorophore-labelled DNA fragments are 
caused to migrate through a gel and a light excitation portion 
and a photodetector are provided for each electrophoresis 
track in an area 15 - 20 cm below the start point of 
electrophoresis. The DNA fragments are assayed as they pass 
through the line connecting the light excitation portion and 
the photodetector. A typical procedure of the method is 
described below. First, using as template the DNA chain to be 
determined for its base sequence, DNAs of various lengths with 
known terminal base species are replicated by a method 
involving an enzymatic reaction (the dideoxy method). Then, 
the replicated DNAs are labelled with a fluorophore. Stated 
more specifically, there are prepared a group of adenine (A) 
fragments, a group of cytosine (C) fragments, a group of 
guanine (G) fragments and a group of thymine (T) fragments, 
all being labelled with a fluorophore. A mixture of these 
fragment groups is injected into separate lane grooves in an 
electrophoretic gel and, thereafter, a voltage is applied at  
 
opposite ends of the gel. Since DNA is a chained polymer with 
negative charges, it will move across the gel at a rate in 
inverse proportion to its molecular weight. The shorter the 
DNA chain (the smaller its molecular weight), the faster will 
it move and vice versa; this is the principle behind the 
fractionation of DNA by molecular weight. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (Kokai) No. 
21556/1988 teaches a DNA base sequencer that is adapted in 
such a way that a line on the gel in an apparatus
