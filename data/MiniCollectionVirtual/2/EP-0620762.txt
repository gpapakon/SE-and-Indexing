Size reduction device (10) for all types of 
material, especially wood, 


having a drivable, essentially cylindrical rotor 
device (18) to which objects are fed for size 

reduction and which essentially has a smooth 
surface (26), 
having blade elements (28), 

- - each blade element (28) having an essentially 
triangular peripheral contour and 
- - each blade element (28) being fastenable to a 
blade carrier element (36) fastened on the 

surface (26) of the rotor device (18) and 
- - the blade element (28) having a recess (40) and 
the associated blade carrier element (36) 

having a recess (44), both recesses (40; 44) 
lying in mutual alignment when the blade 

element (28) is mounted on the blade carrier 
element (36), 
 
characterized in that 


the blade elements (28) rest with one side of a 
triangle directly upon the smooth surface (26) of 

the rotor device (18), 
the blade element (28) has in the marginal region 
of the recess (40), at least on one side, an 

annular cross-sectional reinforcement (46) of 
conical outer contour and 
the blade carrier element (36) has a recess (45) 
of conical inner contour, which recess is shaped 

in accordance with the cross-sectional reinforcement 
(46) of the blade element (28). 
Size reduction device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the blade elements (28) are 

configured as equilateral triangular plate elements. 
Size reduction device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the blade elements (28) are disposed 

along at least two opposite-running helixes (S1, 
S2) in the peripheral direction on the rotor device (18). 
Size reduction device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the blade element (28) has a recess 

(40) having an internal thread (42) and the associated 
blade carrier element (36) has a recess (44), both 

recesses (40; 44) lying in mutual alignment when the 
blade element (28) is mounted on the blade carrier 

element (36) and the blade element (28) being detachably 
fastenable to the blade carrier element (36) by a fastening 

screw (48) which can be introduced from the recess 
(44) of the blade carrier element (36). 
Size reduction device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the blade carrier elements (36) are 

fastened to the rotor device (18) by means of a weld 
connection (38). 
Blade element (28) for a size reduction device 
according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, the blade 

element (28) being configured as a triangular plate 
element and such that it is detachably fastenable to a 

blade carrier element (36), characterized in that the 
blade element (28) has in the marginal region of the 

recess (40), at least on one side, an annular cross-sectional 
reinforcement (46) of conical outer contour. 
Blade element according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that 


the blade element (28) has a recess (40) having 
an internal thread (42) and 
the blade element is detachably fastenable to the 
blade carrier element (36) by a fastening screw 

(48) which can be introduced from the recess (44) 
of the blade carrier element (36), the thread of 

the fastening screw (48) engaging in the internal 
thread (42) of the blade element (28).
