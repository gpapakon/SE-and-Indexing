<DESCRIPTION>
 TRAP MICROSTRIP PIFACROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is based on the Swedish patent application SE 9702659-5 Î›Compact Antenna Device' which is hereby incorporated by reference and the international patent application PCT/SE98/00899 'Compact Antenna Device' which is hereby incorporated by reference. Both are having the same applicant as the present invention.TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates in general to an antenna structure and more specifically to a microstrip antenna structure.DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTWith the recent advances in mobile communication, there has been tremendous interest in development of small size and low profile antennas for the further miniaturization of mobile radio communication equipment. Goals include small size, low profile, low cost and ease of manufacturing. Frequencies of interest can for instance be 900 MHz band antennas for applications in cellular handheld radio devices such as GSM (890-935 MHz), indoor cordless telephones such as the European CT1+ (886-931 MHz) and 1.9 GHz band antennas for applications in DECT (1.89 GHz) and PCS (1.8 GHz). These systems have their own requirements in antenna characteristics, such as resonant frequency, bandwidth, gain etc.Existing antennas used in mobile phones include the most common whip antennas (monopole) , microstrip patch antennas and planar inverted-F antennas. Microstrip patch antennas and planar inverted-F antennas are typically low-profile antennas. Although the microstrip patch antenna previously has had the shortcoming 

of narrow bandwidth and low efficiency, its advantages of low profile, small size and light weight are attractive properties.However both planar inverted-F antennas and microstrip patch antennas exhibits size problems when they should be adjusted for the specific frequencies and fit into the newer generation of miniature mobile radio communication devices. This is particular problematic when modern mobile phone design calls for multiple antennas to be placed into one handset to be able to simultaneously communicate in two different systems, in a very broad frequency band or more generally to take advantage of antenna diversity.EP 749 176 'Planar and non-planar double C-patch antennas having different aperture shapes' discloses a patch antenna. The C- patch antenna includes a truncated ground plane, a layer of dielectric material having a first surface overlaying the ground plane and an opposing second surface, and an electrically conductive layer.
