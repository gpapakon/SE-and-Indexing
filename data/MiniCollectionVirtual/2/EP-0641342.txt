<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]-quinoline
compounds. In other aspects, this invention
relates to 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amines,
intermediates for the preparation of such compounds,
pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds,
and pharmacological methods of using such compounds.
This invention also relates to methods of inducing
biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor.The first reliable report of the 1H-imidazo-[4,5-c]quinoline
ring system, Backman et al., J. Org.
Chem. 15, 1278-1284 (1950), describes the synthesis of
1-(6-methoxy-8-quinolinyl)-2-methyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]-quinoline
for possible use as an antimalarial agent.
Subsequently, syntheses of various substituted 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolines
have been reported. For
example, Jain et al., J. Med. Chem. 11, pp. 87-92
(1968), has synthesized the compound
1-[2-(4-piperidyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline as
a possible anticonvulsant and cardiovascular agent.
Also, Baranov et al., Chem. Abs. 85, 94362 (1976), has
reported several 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolines, and
Berenyi et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem. 18, 1537-1540
(1981), has reported certain 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]-quinolines.Certain antiviral 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amines
are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,338
(Gerster). These compounds are substituted on the
1-position by alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, acyloxyalkyl,
benzyl, phenylethyl or substituted phenylethyl, and at
the 2-position with hydrogen, alkyl, benzyl, or 
substituted benzyl, phenylethyl or phenyl.
Furthermore, these compounds are known to induce
interferon biosynthesis. Other antiviral
1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amines, substituted on the
1-position by alkenyl substituents, are described in
U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,624 (Gerster).U.S. Pat. No. 4,698,348 (Gerster) discloses
lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolines that are active as
bronchodilators, such as 4-substituted lH-imidazo-[4,5-c]quinolines
wherein the 4-substituent is, inter
alia, hydrogen, chloro, alkylamino, or dialkylamino,
and the 2-substituent is, inter alia, hydroxyalkyl,
aminoalkyl, or alkanamidoalkyl. Said patent also
discloses 3-amino and 3-nitro quinoline intermediates
substituted at the 4-position by hydroxyalkylamino or
cyclohexylmethylamino, and lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline
N-oxide intermediates substituted at the 2-position
with, inter alia, hydroxyalkyl, aminoalkyl, or
alkanamidoalkyl.Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an endogenic
glycoprotein that has the capability to selectively
destroy tumor cells. For this reason there is
considerable interest in TNF as a cancer
