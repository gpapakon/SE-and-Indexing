<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention is referred to a recovery system for the dissipated 
energy of an engine motor vehicle during its running conditions; such a 

system is substantially formed by the following subsystems: 

subsystem A: primary cooling system 
subsystem B: secondary cooling system 
subsystem C: exhaust gases circuit 
subsystem D: compressed air circuit 
subsystem E: braking circuit having an air compressor 
 
Such a system, wherein the thermal energy dissipated during the cooling 

of the engine motor (1) and the kinetic energy 1/2 mvÂ² dissipated during 
the braking action of the vehicle, are both recovered in form of 

potential energy represented by compressed air, which is stored in a 
suitable storage vessel (11) for its later use to produce mechanical 

energy, implies remarkable advantages, in an absolute sense, for the huge 
saving of fuel an
d also for the absence of pollution of the environmental 
air.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is well known the fact that internal combustion engine vehicles do 
disperse during their running conditions, a high quantity of heat, 
harmful smokes and noise into the surrounding ambient air. The exhaust gases (smokes) discharged by an internal combustion engine 
vehicle in residential districts of geographical areas, having a 
standstill ambient air, are always one of the main components of air 
pollution in urban areas. In the same way, the noise produced by the engines and the vehicles 
during their running conditions, particularly in urban traffic, 
represents one of the main components of environmental acustical 
pollution. As to the heat dissipation, this is due to the fact that only a small 
part of flue heat energy, burnt by internal combustion engine installed 
on vehicles, is converted into a mechanical energy useful for vehicle 
motion itself. Indeed a remarkable quantity of heat is dissipated by the engine cooling 
water system, through the radiator, an equivalent quantity of heat is 
also dissipated by exhaust gases (smokes) at a high temperature, by the 
silencer of running engine vehicle. Another loss of heat is due to the movement of vehicle during its 
braking till stopping situation, when mechanical energy, due to the 
movement of the vehicle mass, is converted into thermal energy in the 
braking system installed on wheels of vehicle same. Up to now there is no notice of particular studies of systems and 
applications able to solve, or at least to reduce such problems of 
environmental pollution and heat dissipation.  The referred applications in this field are above all aiming to improve 
only the combustion control, to use exhaust gases powered turbine, to use 
"clean" fuels, e.g. unleaded petrol, whereas they do not aim to recover 
the heat losses. Therefore, the system described in the following is developing a 
mechanical solution based on a new process to recover the energy 
dissipated in form of heat by a vehicle during its running conditions. 
This recovery is performed by means of compressed air, principally 
generated in two manners by air compressors, and put at disposal in a 
suitable compressed air storage vessel. In the first recovery manner of dissipated energy, the air compressor is 
coupled through the same rotation shaft with a steam turbine operated by 
a suitable fluid which vaporizes at a low temperature value. The air 
compressor is connected with an air storage vessel, which serves as a 
storage unit for the whole energy recovery system. The low
