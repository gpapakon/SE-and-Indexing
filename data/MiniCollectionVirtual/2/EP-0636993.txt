<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image storage
managing apparatus and image storage managing method for
properly retrieving and displaying stored image data.For shops and sales companies which sell
merchandises, sales management of merchandises and customer
management are important management works.Recently, POS (Point Of Sales) management has been
introduced for sales management. With the use of this
POS management, as a bar code affixed to a merchandise
is read out, data on which merchandise has been sold is
registered so that it is possible to discriminate how
well individual merchandises have been sold and this
information can be an index for placing an order for
merchandises or sending back some merchandises.
Accumulating such information provides a way to easily
discriminating which merchandises are sold in which
season, on which day of the week and in which time zone.
It is apparent that sales management has been
computerized significantly.Customer management, however, is often a paper-basis
process involving customer carder or the like.
Further, the contents of the management information contain
only imageless, character information. In some
cases, a silver photograph or Polaroid photograph may
merely be stuck on each customer card.Attempts have also been made on the computerization 
of the customer management. In this computerized
system, ID cards of a credit-card size, such as service
cards and membership cards, affixed with bar codes or
magnetic tapes are issued to individual customers, and
various types of information are data-based for the
individual customers. In this case, however, accumulated
information also consists only character
information.Although the computerization of both the merchandise
sales management and customer management is progressing
gradually, those managements are independent of
each other and are not linked to each other. For
instance, for convenience stores, it is not so important
who bought, i.e., it is not considered so important what
merchandise has been sold to what people.However, there are some fields in which it becomes
very important what merchandise has been sold to what
people. In the apparel field, for example, if information
on what customers whose preferences to clothes are
known bought what merchandises or clothes is known, this
information becomes very effective in planning and selling
clothes. This system requires image data as well as
character data. EP-A-0 368 475 discloses an image storage managing apparatus
comprising customer data storage
