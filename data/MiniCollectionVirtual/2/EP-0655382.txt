A telescopic steering column for motor vehicles with an 
upper steering shaft, which is guided in an outer column and 

at whose end the steering wheel is mounted, a lower steering 
shaft engaging in the steering gear and a telescopic 

intermediate steering shaft, which connects the upper and 
the lower steering shafts together via universal joints, the 

individual steering shaft parts adopting a deflection angle 
in space relative to one another in each position of the 

steering wheel, which angle changes during the telescoping 
procedure, characterised in that a guide means in the 

intermediate steering shaft sets the two shaft parts (1.1. 
and 1.2.) in helical motion. 
A telescopic steering column for motor vehicles 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the guide in the 

intermediate steering shaft is formed by a rod connection. 
A telescopic steering column for motor vehicles 
according to claim 2, characterised in that the rod (2) is 

fixed in the first shaft part (1.1.) and is guided in a slot 
(3) in the second shaft part (1.2.). 
A telescopic steering column for motor vehicles 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the guide means 

is formed by at least one ball track stamped into the shaft 
parts (1.1. and 1.2.), in which ball track at least one ball 

is guided and thereby sets the shaft parts (1.1. and 1.2.) 
in helical motion. 
A telescopic steering column for motor vehicles 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the intermediate 

steering shaft is formed by a serrated shaft connection 
rotated about the centre line.
