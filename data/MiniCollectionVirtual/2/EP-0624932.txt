<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for mounting an electrical 
connector (10) to one side (26) of a panel (28) or other 

planar substrate. The connector includes a housing (12) 
having a mounting face (32) with a mounting boss (30) 

projecting therefrom. The boss includes an enlarged head 
portion (34). The panel includes an aperture (36) shaped 

for receiving the enlarged head portion therethrough such 
that the boss is rotatable in the aperture from a first 

insertion position and a second mounted position of the 
housing whereat the enlarged head portion overlaps the 

opposite side (40) of the panel (28). Resilient detent 
latches (44) on the housing snap into detent recesses (46) 

in the panel automatically when the housing is in its 
second mounted position to lock the housing thereat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a system for
mounting an electrical connector to one side of a panel or
other planar substrate.Panel mounted electrical connectors are well
known in the art, and such a connector generally includes
a housing mounting a plurality of terminals for mating with
a complementary connector. The housing may be mounted to
a generally rigid panel for mating of the connector with
the complementary connector through an opening in the
panel, or the housing may be mounted on the panel simply
for structural or support purposes within a circuit
interconnection system.Various means are used to mount the connector to
a panel. The most prominent mounting means usually
includes mounting clips or brackets operatively associated
between the connector housing and the panel to mount and
hold the connector to the panel. A problem with such
separate mounting components is that they add to the cost
of such panel mounting systems, in both the manufacturing
and assembling of the systems. Other panel mounting
systems have included simple mounting pegs or board locks
which project from the connector housing through holes in
the panel or planar substrate. A problem with simple
mounting pegs or board locks is that they are not
sufficiently sturdy to withstand substantial mating forces
on the mounted connector. There is a definite need for a new and improved
approach to mounting electrical connectors to panels or
other planar substrates, particularly a system which is
inexpensive to manufacture, simple to use and reliable and
sturdy in operation. This invention is directed to
satisfying that need and solving the problems identified
above.US-A-3 523 267 discloses an disengageable electrical
connector for use with a printing circuit board. The
electrical connector comprises an insulating housing
having a locking boss. This locking boss has locking ears
having shoulders which are helically inclined in a common
direction towards the surface of the side of the housing.
Upon insertion of the locking boss through an open in a
printed circuit board and upon rotation of the housing
relative to the board, the ears will prevent axial movement
of the housing away from the printed circuit board.An object, therefore, of the invention is to
provide a new and improved system for mounting an
electrical connector to one side of a panel or other planar
substrate.Systems according to the invention are defined in independent claims 1 and 3.In the exemplary embodiment

<CLAIMS>
A system for mounting an electrical connector

(10) to one (26) side of a panel (23), comprising:

a connector (10) including a housing (12) having
a mounting face (34) with a mounting boss (30) projecting

therefrom, the mounting boss including an enlarged head
portion (34); and
a panel (28) including an aperture (36) shaped
for receiving the enlarged head portion therethrough such

that the boss is rotatable in the aperture from a first
insertion position and a second mounted position of the

housing whereat the enlarged head portion overlaps the
opposite side (40) of the panel (28); and
mounting means (50) on the underside (38) of the enlarged
head portion (34) of the boss (30) for engaging the

opposite side (40) of the panel (23) and drawing the
housing (12) against the one side (23) of the panel in

response to said rotation of the hcusing from the first
position to the second position,

characterized in that said mounting means (50) are wedge means,
comprising a tapered rib (50) having a maximum thickness nearer

the boss (30) and a minimum thickness nearer the periphery of the
enlarged head portion (34).
The system of claim 1, wherein said tapered
rib (50) is of deformable plastic material whereby the rib

can be deformed when the housing (12) is rotated to the
second position.
A system for mounting an electrical
connector (10) to one side (26) of a panel (12),

comprising: 

a connector (10) including a housing (12) having
a mounting face (32) with a mounting boss (30) projecting

therefrom, the mounting boss including an enlarged head
portion (34);
a panel (28) including an aperture (36) shaped
for receiving the enlarged head portion therethrough such

that the boss is rotatable in the aperture from a first
insertion position and a second mounted position of the

housing whereat the enlarged head portion overlaps the
opposite side (40) of the panel ; and
mounting means (50) on the underside (38) of the
enlarged head portion (34) of the boss (30) for engaging

the opposite side (40) of the panel (28) and drawing the
housing (12) against the one side (26) of the panel in

response to said rotation of the housing from the first
position to the second position, characterized in that said mounting means (50) are wedge means

(50) being of deformable plastic material which can deform
when the housing is rotated to the second position.
