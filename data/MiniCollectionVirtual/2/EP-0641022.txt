<ABSTRACT>
A method for creating isolation structures in a 
substrate without having to increase the field implant 

doses to prevent punch through. This particular advantage 
is achieved by first growing a pad oxide on the substrate. 

Polysilicon is deposited on top of the pad oxide layer. 
Next, silicon nitride, used for masking, is deposited on 

the polysilicon layer. An opening, also called an 
isolation space, is etched into the three layers, exposing 

part of the substrate. A first field oxide is grown in the 
opening. This first field oxide layer is etched to expose 

a portions of the substrate along the edge of the field 
oxide region. Then, trenches are etched into the exposed 

portions of the substrate, and field implantation of 
dopants is performed. After implantation, a second field 

oxide layer is grown. The silicon nitride, polysilicon, 
and pad oxide are then removed, resulting in the isolation 

structure of the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated devices and more specifically to isolation structures in semi-conductors.Various isolation structures employing materials such as field oxide have been used to isolate devices. As devices become smaller, such as deep-submicron silicon devices, it is desirable to decrease or reduce the isolation spaces. Reducing isolation spaces with local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) or modifications of LOCOS requires increased field implant doses to prevent punch through. One draw back of increasing the implant dose is that the junction breakdown is reduced and junction leakage is increased.Trench methods of isolation have been used to increase the channel length and therefore reduce the punch through. These methods, however, have some difficulty in filling variable width trenches and are sometimes difficult to process. Double trench isolation is one system used to isolate devices. See Park et al., Double Trench Isolation (DTI): A Novel Isolation Technology for Deep-Submicron Silicon Devices, VLSI Symposium Digest, May, 1993. Presently known methods for creating double trench isolation structures are complex. For example, the Park et al. method requires placement and removal of silicon nitride spacers in the isolation space to provide windows for creating of trenches.Therefore, it would be desirable to have a simple method for producing a uniform trench size at the isolation edge, which increases the channel length and is easy to fill.US-A-4873203 discloses a method for forming an insulation film on silicon buried in a trench is which the thickness of SiO2 on the surface of the peripheral portion of the trench is increased.GB-A-2179788 discloses an isolation structure for MOS devices and a process of preparing the same.EP-A-0111774 discloses a method for manufacturing monolithic integrated circuit structures and more particularly methods for dielectrically isolating regions of monocrystalline silicon from other regions of monocrystalline silicon.The following described embodiments provide a method for creating isolation structures in a substrate without having to increase the field implant doses to prevent punch through. This particular advantage is achieved by creating an oxidation barrier by first growing a pad oxide on the substrate. Next, polysilicon is deposited on top of the pad oxide layer. Then, silicon nitride, used for masking, is deposited on the polysilicon layer. An opening, also called an isolation space, is etched into the three layers, exposing part of the
