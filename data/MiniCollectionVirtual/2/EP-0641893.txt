<ABSTRACT>
A concrete barrier wall for traffic ways comprises interconnectable individual elements (1) which are equipped at their narrow end faces (2) with coupling rails (3) of at least approximately C- or T-shaped cross-section. The coupling rails (3) are connectable directly or via an intermediate member (4) to the coupling rail (3) of the neighbouring individual element (1). The two mutually opposite coupling rails (3) of each individual element (1) are fixedly interconnected by a longitudinal element (5). The narrow sides (6) of the longitudinal elements (5) are formed by profiled rails (7) having a longitudinally oriented web (7') and transversely situated flanges (7''), that is to say for example by I-, C- or T-shaped profiles which are fixedly connected to the coupling rails (3) as reinforcing elements.

Concrete crash barrier for traffic routes, consisting of individual elements (1) 
which can be connected together, wherein each individual element (1) is provided 

on its two narrow end faces (2) with respective coupling rails (3) with an at least 
approximately C-shaped or T-shaped cross section, each coupling rail (3) can be 

connected directly or indirectly by means of an intermediate member (4) to a 
coupling rail (3) of an adjacent individual element (1), and the two opposing 

coupling rails (3) of each individual element (1) are connected together by means 
of a longitudinal element (5) consisting of longitudinal bars (5') and narrow sides 

(6), characterised in that the narrow sides (6) of the longitudinal element (5) 
consist of I-shaped or T-shaped profiled rails (7) with at least one longitudinally 

aligned web (7') and transverse flanges (7"), the coupling rails (3) being welded 
on to the transverse flanges (7") on the rear faces of the profiled rails (7) or being 

integrated into the profiled rails (7) and rigidly connected therewith. 
Concrete crash barrier according to claim 1, characterised in that the profiled rails 
(7) ofthe narrow sides (6) ofthe longitudinal elements (5) have flanges (7") which 

project laterally beyond the associated coupling rails (3) as anchoring or 
reinforcing wings. 
Concrete crash barrier according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the 
longitudinal bars (5') of the longitudinal element (5) are welded on to the upper 

and lower end faces of the webs (7') of the profiled rails (7), the ends of the 
longitudinal bars (5') being at a safe distance (a) from the rear wall of the coupling 

rail (3) and the profiled rails (7) and the associated coupling rails (3) each being 
galvanised in one piece, without longitudinal bars (5'). 
Concrete crash barrier according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the 
profiled rails (7) of the narrow sides (6) of the longitudinal element (5) are divided 

into two or more sections, further longitudinal bars (5') being arranged between 
the upper and lower longitudinal bars, the ends of which are fixed in between the  

 
webs (7') of the profiled rails (7) spaced apart by approximately the diameter of a 

longitudinal bar and are welded to the respective upper and lower sections. 
Concrete crash barrier according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterised in that, in the 
case of coupling rails (3) with an at least approximately C-shaped cross section 

and substantially trapezoidal supporting arms (8), the intermediate member (4) has 
an approximately I-shaped cross section and can be inserted into the coupling rail 

(3), the transverse flanges (4') of the intermediate member (4) being substantially 
adapted to the shape of the supporting arms (8) at the sides directed towards the 

supporting arms (8), resulting in contact between the flanges (4') and the 
supporting arms (8) close to the ends of the flanges or close to the shoulders of the 

supporting arms. 
Concrete crash barrier according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
coupling rails (3) on the narrow end faces (2) of the individual elements (1) are 

situated in vertical slots (9) which are open towards the bottom, but closed 
towards the top, wherein the intermediate member (4) can be inserted from below 

or the individual elements (1) can be placed on the intermediate member (4) from 
above. 
Concrete crash barrier according to claim 6, characterised in that the intermediate 
member (4) is secured in the ground or is driven into the subsoil or is embedded in 

a concrete foundation. 
Concrete crash banier according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that two 
individual elements (1) connected together are kept at a distance from one another 

by means of wedges (10), spacers or the like arranged in the gap between the two 
end faces (2) directed towards one another. 
Concrete crash barrier according to claim 8, characterised in that the wedges (10), 
spacers or the like rest in substantially channel-shaped vertical recesses (11) in the 

end faces (2).  
 
Concrete crash barrier according to claim 9, characterised in that the wedges (10), 
spacers or the like are tubular pieces and the recesses (11) are conical and 

narrower at the bottom.
