<ABSTRACT>
In order to control the access of a number of units (P) connected to a bus (BU), a ring of optical lines is provided in which a pulse generator (IG) and coupling elements (OE) are arranged. The coupling elements (OE) are allocated to the units (P). To control the access, a pulse is fed by the pulse generator (IG) into the ring (RI). This pulse is successively conducted via the coupling elements (OE) to the units which lengthen the pulse when they wish to have access to the bus (BU). The lengthening is done in accordance with the period of the access to the bus. The access to the bus, however, is only allowed when the rear edge of the pulse present occurs at the input of the coupling element (OE) associated with the unit (P). In this manner, the decentralised control of the access of units (P) to a common bus (BU) is possible with the aid of coupling elements and a line ring.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for decentralized control of the
access to a bus (BU) by units (P) connected to the bus,


a) in which a ring (RI) composed of at least one line
is provided,
b) in which a pulse transmitter (IG) in the ring (RI)
feeds a pulse into the ring if the end of a pulse is

present at its entry from the ring,
c) in which at least one coupling element (OE) is
provided in the ring (RI), which coupling element (OE)

has a connection in two directions to at least one unit
(P),
d) in which the interaction between the coupling
element (OE) and unit (P) is designed in such a way that


d1) the pulse is fed to the unit,
d2) when an access request from the unit to the bus is
present, access is started at the end of the pulse,
d3) when the access request is present, the pulse is
extended by the duration of the access and is transmitted

back to the coupling element which feeds this pulse back
into the ring,
d4) when an access request is not present, the pulse is
transmitted on to the output by the coupling element

without being influenced.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 in which connected
to at least one coupling element is a further ring

composed of at least one coupling element which is
assigned to at least one unit or at least one further

ring.
Arrangement according to Claim 2 in which a
further pulse transmitter is arranged in the further 

ring.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims in which the line is an optical waveguide and the

coupling element is an optical element.
Arrangement according to Claim 4 in which in each
case one optical element is assigned to each unit.
Arrangement according to Claim 4 or 5, in which
the optical element (OE) is composed of a photodiode

(PD), an amplifier (R) and a laser diode (LD),

in which the pulse from the preceding optical element or
pulse transmitter in the ring and a pulse (S2) which is

supplied by the unit are present at the photodiode (PD),
and which carries out an OR logical link, and which
carries out an OR link,
in which the laser diode feeds back into the ring the
pulse which is emitted at the output of the photodiode.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, in which the pulse transmitter is a monoflop.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, in which a circuit arrangement is provided in the

processor in order to control the access of the processor
(P) to the bus (BU), said arrangement comprising a D

register (D-FF) and an AND element (UD),

in which arrangement the access request of the processor
is fed to the D input of the register (D-FF), the pulse

(S1) is fed to the C input of the register, and which
emits at the output the pulse (S2) which is extended by

the access duration,
and in which the pulse (S1), in inverted form and the
pulse (S2) emitted at the output of the register (D-FF)

are fed to the AND element (UD) and which generates an
AND logic link for the generation of the permission to

access the bus (BU).
