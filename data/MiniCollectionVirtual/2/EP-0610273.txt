<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
manufacture of fiber reinforced composite bodies of 
a spar and shell construction and, more 
specifically, to the manufacture of lightweight 
propulsor blades, such as propeller blades, prop-fan 
blades, turbo-fan blades and the like constructed of 
a composite load bearing spar supporting a composite 
fiber reinforced shell, by resin transfer molding 
methods. In aircraft applications it is highly desirable 
to minimize the weight of aircraft components as 
every pound saved in aircraft weight translates to 
fuel savings and/or greater payload capacity. With 
respect to propeller, turboprop or turbofan aircraft 
engine components, it is well appreciated that the 
propulsor blades are the most likely candidate for 
weight reduction since the weights of other related 
components, e.g. blade retention means, pitch change 
mechanisms, hub disks, shafts and bearings, are 
typically directly dependent upon the magnitude of 
the blade centrifugal loading borne by these 
components. The propulsor blades per se, however, 
can be made lighter in weight so long as the 
centrifugal pull, bending moments, torsion loads and 
vibratory loads, imposed upon the blades during 
operation are effectively transmitted to the blade 
retention means for distribution to the aforenoted 
load bearing components.  
 It is known in the art to produce lighter 
weight propulsor blades of a built-up construction 
wherein a blade is formed of an outer shell made of 
lightweight composite material, and an internal load 
bearing spar which is bonded to the interior surface 
of the shell and extends from within the shell 
cavity to terminate beyond the shell in a root end 
which is adapted to be mounted to a suitable blade 
retention means. Examples of such composite blades 
are presented in U.S. patents 3,799,701; 4,784,575 
and 4,810,167. It has become conventional practice in the 
aircraft industry to manufacture such blades with a 
shell formed about the load bearing spar as a molded 
fiber reinforced resin body using resin transfer 
molding methods. Such fiber reinforced resin shells 
exhibit high strength and low weight characteristics 
and in aircraft applications typically offer at 
least as high strength as corresponding articles 
made of metal at a substantially lower weight. For, 
example, commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,648,921 
discloses a method of making a fiber reinforced 
airfoil shaped propeller blade assembly wherein 4 to 
7 layers of woven fiberglass cloth are layed up over 
a

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a 
lightweight composite propulsor blade having an 

axially extending load bearing spar disposed within 
a fiber reinforced shell comprising the steps of: 


a. forming a spar subassembly (30) having a 
short metal retention member (10) and a core (20) of 

lightweight cellular material extending axially 
outwardly from the retention member (10); 
b. repeatedly braiding 
structural fibers over the length of the spar subassembly (30) 

to provide a dry wrap (22) about the spar subassembly (30) 
formed of a plurality of layers (26) of angularly woven 

structural fibers; 
c. during said spar braiding step, laying 
up spanwisely extending plies (28) of substantially 

unidirectional structural fibers between successive 
angularly woven layers (26); 
d. forming a first filler body (42) of 
lightweight cellular material on a leading edge of 

the braided spar assembly (40) and a second filler body (44) 
of lightweight cellular material on a trailing edge 

of the braided spar assembly to form a blade subassembly (50); 
e. forming a dry shell wrap (52) of braided 
angularly woven fabric about the blade subassembly (50); 

and 
f. simultaneously impregnating the dry 
braided fiber wrap (22) of the braided spar assembly (40) and 

the dry braided fabric shell wrap (52) about the blade 
subassembly (50) with a curable resin material whereby 

upon subsequent curing of the resin material a blade 
assembly (60) having a composite fiber reinforced load  

 
bearing spar and composite fiber reinforced shell is 

formed. 
A method as recited in Claim 1 wherein the 
step of forming a dry shell wrap (52) of braided 

angularly woven fabric about the blade subassembly (50) 
comprises fitting at least one dry preformed braided 

fabric sock (52) over the blade subassembly. 
A method as recited in Claim 2 wherein the 
step of forming a first filler body (42) of lightweight 

cellular material on a leading edge of the braided 
spar assembly (40) and a second filler body (44) of 

lightweight cellular material on a trailing edge of 
the spar assembly (40) to form a blade subassembly (50) 

comprises: 

a. disposing the braided spar assembly (40) 
into a molding die; and 
b. injecting a lightweight cellular 
material into the molding die to form the leading 

edge foam filler (42) and the trailing edge foam filler (44) 
on the braided spar subassembly (40).
