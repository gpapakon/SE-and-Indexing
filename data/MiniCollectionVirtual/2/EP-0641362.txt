<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to copolymers of ethylene
and branched α-olefins, and more particularly to tough,
high strength copolymers thereof. This invention also
relates to a process for copolymerizing ethylene with
branched α-olefins utilizing certain transition metal
compounds from Group IV B of the Periodic Table of
Elements that produces high molecular weight
copolymers.As far as Applicants are aware, it has not been
possible to prepare ethylene copolymers with many
branched α-olefin comonomers, particularly where the
branch is in the 3-position, with sufficiently high
molecular weight for most applications, using a traditional
Ziegler-Natta catalyst.It has been proposed to use certain metallocenes
such as bis(cyclopentadienyl) titanium or zirconium
dialkyls in combination with aluminum alkyl/water
cocatalyst as a homogeneous catalyst system for the
polymerization of olefins in general. For example:
German Patent Application 2,608,863 teaches the use of
a catalyst system for the polymerization of ethylene
consisting of bis(cyclopentadienyl) titanium dialkyl,
aluminum trialkyl and water; German Patent Application
2,608,933 teaches an ethylene polymerization catalyst
system consisting of zirconium metallocenes of the
general formula (cyclopentadienyl)nZrY4-n, wherein n
stands for an integer in the range of 1 to 4, Y for R,
CH2AlR2, CH2CH2AlR2 and CH2CH(AlR2)2, wherein R stands
for alkyl or metallo alkyl, an aluminum trialkyl
cocatalyst and water; European Patent Application No.
0035242 teaches a process for preparing ethylene and
atactic propylene polymers in the presence of a
halogen-free Ziegler catalyst system of (1) 
cyclopentadienyl compound of the formula
(cyclopentadienyl)nMY4-n in which n is an integer from
1 to 4, M is a transition metal, especially zirconium,
and Y is either hydrogen, a C1-C5 alkyl or metallo
alkyl group or a radical having the following general
formula CH2AlR2, CH2CH2AlR2, and CH2CH(AlR2)2 in which
R represents a C1-C5 alkyl or metallo alkyl group, and
(2) an alumoxane; and U. S. Patent 4,564,647 teaches a
low pressure process for polymerizing ethylene, either
alone or in combination with small amounts of other α-olefins,
in the presence of a catalyst which may
comprise a cyclopentadienyl compound, represented by
the formula (Cp)MR2R3R4 wherein (Cp) represents a
cyclopentadienyl group, M represents titanium,
vanadium, zirconium or hafnium, and R2, R3 and R4 are
each an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a
cyclopentadienyl group, a halogen atom or a hydrogen
atom, an
