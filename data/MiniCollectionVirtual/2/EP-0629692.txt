<ABSTRACT>
Liquid enzyme preparations which contain the enzyme as aqueous enzyme particle suspension, highly disperse fillers and a liquid alkylene oxide polymer based on ethylenediamine with a molecular weight in the range from 500 to 8200 are described. The liquid enzyme preparations may contain all enzymes customary for detergents and cleaning purposes, in particular alkaline proteases. Furthermore, a process for the production of these liquid enzyme preparations and the use thereof in liquid detergents and cleaners are described.
