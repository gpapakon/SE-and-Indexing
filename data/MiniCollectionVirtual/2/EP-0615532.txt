<ABSTRACT>
A lactide polymer composition combining compositional and purity limitations and catalyst optimization or addition of stabilizing agents resulting in a melt-stable polymer is disclosed. The melt-stable lactide polymer comprises a mixture of polylactide material having a number average molecular weight of at least about 10,000, residual lactide in concentration of less than about 2% and water in a concentration no greater than 1000 parts-per-million. A stabilizing agent in an amount sufficient to reduce depolymerization of the lactide polymer during melt-processing or alternatively, control of catalyst level at a molar ratio of monomer to catalyst greater than 3000:1 is also included in the melt-stable composition. A process for manufacture of a melt-stable lactide polymer composition includes polymerizing a lactide mixture and adding stabilizing agents sufficient to reduce depolymerization of the polylactide during melt-processing, followed by devolatilizing the polylactide to remove monomer and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a melt-stable
lactide polymer composition
in the field
of degradable polymers.The continued depletion of landfill space and
the problems associated with incineration of waste have
led to the need for development of truly biodegradable
polymers to be utilized as substitutes for non-biodegradable
or partially biodegradable petrochemical-based
polymers. The use of lactic acid and lactide to
manufacture a biodegradable polymer is well-known in the
medical industry. As disclosed by Nieuwenhuis et al.
(U.S. Pat. 5,053,485), such polymers have been used for
making biodegradable sutures, clamps, bone plates and
biologically active controlled release devices.
Processes developed for the manufacture of polymers to
be utilized in the medical industry have incorporated
techniques which respond to the need for high purity and
biocompatability in the final product. These processes
were designed to produce small volumes of high dollar-value
products, with less emphasis on manufacturing cost
and yield.In order to meet projected needs for
biodegradable packaging materials, others have
endeavored to optimize lactide polymer processing
systems. Gruber et al. (U.S. Pat. 5,142,023) disclose a
continuous process for the manufacture of lactide
polymers with controlled optical purity from lactic acid
having physical properties suitable for replacing
present petrochemical-based polymers for packaging,
paper-coating and other non-medical industry
applications. Generally, manufacturers of polymers utilizing
processes such as those disclosed by Gruber et al. will
convert raw material monomers into polymer beads, resins
or other pelletized or powdered products. The polymer
in this form is then sold to end users who extrude,
blow-mold, cast films, blow films, thermoform,
injection-mold or fiber-spin the polymer at elevated
temperatures to form useful articles. The above
processes are collectively referred to as melt-processing.
Polymers produced by processes such as
those disclosed by Gruber et al., which are to be sold
commercially as beads, resins, powders or other non-finished
solid forms are generally referred to
collectively as polymer resins.Prior to the present invention, it is believed
that there has been no disclosure of a combination of
composition control requirements which will lead to the
production of commercially viable lactide polymer resins
for the melt-processors.It is generally known that lactide polymers or
polylactide are unstable. The concept of instability
though, has both
