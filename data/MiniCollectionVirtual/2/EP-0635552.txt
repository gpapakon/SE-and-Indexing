<ABSTRACT>
A water-borne coating composition contains as one component 
a latex of an epoxidised natural rubber. The composition 

has a low minimum film-forming temperature (MFT), and 
produces films which are hard, durable and display excellent 

adhesion to substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water-borne coating composition
containing as one component an epoxidised natural rubber, to
the preparation of such a composition and to its use.Natural rubber latex was used as a component in oil-based
paints and in water-based distempers in the 1930's. The
compositions current at that time are extensively reviewed
in "The Chemistry and Technology of Rubber Latex" C.
Falconer Flint 581-590, Chapman & Hall Ltd London 1938.
Although such paints were apparently to be found on the
market, it is known that they suffered from substantial
disadvantages in their stability, consistency, and brushing
characteristics. Moreover, the paint films which they form
suffered particular disadvantages in that they underwent
severe yellowing and embrittlement as a result of oxidated
degradation. Further, the coatings tended to peel and show
low resistance to damage from mechanical impact.Accordingly these early compositions failed to achieve
sustained commercial application.Although a later publication "Latex in Industry" 2nd Edition
R.J. Nobel 689-692 Rubber Age New York 1953 reported a
resurgence of interest in rubber latex-based paints, this
was short-lived. Rubber latex systems had been totally
eclipsed by the advent of polybutadiene and butadiene-styrene
systems developed in the 1940's and acrylic latexes
developed from the 1950's onwards. In short, there has been
effectively no interest in natural rubber-based paint
latexes over the past four decades.We have now found that when epoxidised natural rubber is
used as a component in coating compositions, certain
surprising and unexpected benefits are obtained. For
example, as compared with rubber latex-based coatings, the 
films are relatively resistant to yellowing and
embrittlement. Moreover, films are tough and resistant to
mechanical damage. As compared with coatings based on the
most up-to-date acrylic latex systems, the epoxidised
natural rubber systems produce coating films which are
equally mechanically durable but are far more tenacious in
their adhesion to substrate surfaces. Hence, in contrast to
acrylic-based paint systems they can be used as a film-former
in a coating composition without the need for an
adhesion promoter.US-A-3 243 401 is concerned with latexes of epoxidised
conjugated diene polymers having an epoxy equivalent weight
of 2000 to 200. The epoxidised polymers illustrated in the
Examples are synthetic copolymers. The latexes have many
uses as binders in paper and fabric production and
processing. In use these binders
