<ABSTRACT>
A device for the vertical conveyance of coins 2 comprises a lower horizontal guide track 4, a vertical guide track 5 and an upper horizontal guide track 26 as well as deflecting tracks 6, 24 arranged between the guide tracks and taking the form of an arc of a circle. The guide tracks 4, 5 and 26 as well as the deflecting tracks 6 and 24 are assigned a rotating conveyor belt 7, between one strand of which and the guide and deflecting tracks 4, 6, 5, 24, 26 individually separated coins 2 can thus be conveyed vertically upwards in a manner conveyed flat. The upper horizontal guide track 26 is assigned an upper sorting stage 27 with a further conveyor belt 30 which receives the coins 2. Arranged in the region of the lower horizontal guide track 4 and of the upper sorting stage 27 are recognition devices 21, 33 which allow a recognition, counting, presorting and sorting out of foreign coinage in separate systems (Fig. 3).

Coin-inspection and coin-sorting device for the
vertical conveyance of flatly coins, having a lower

horizontal guide track (4), having a vertical guide track
(5) which is connected to the lower horizontal guide

track (4) via an approximately circular-arc-shaped
deflection track (6), having a further approximately

circular-arc-shaped deflection track (6) at the upper end
of the vertical guide track (5), and having devices (33)

for detecting the denomination of coins and having a
device (27) for sorting the coins, a device for

separately feeding the coins conveyed in the flat
position being disposed at the start of the lower

horizontal guide track (4), characterized

in that an upper horizontal guide track (25, 37, 49) is
provided at the end of the upper, approximately circular-arc-shaped

deflection track (24),
in that the lower, the upper and the vertical guide
tracks (4, 25, 37, 49; 5) and the deflection tracks (6,

24) are formed from strip steel having guide rails (8)
which are mounted on either side and whose spacing is

somewhat greater than the diameter of the largest coins
(2) to be conveyed, and from at least one conveyor belt

(7), which is fed round rollers (11) and round deflection
rollers (15, 16) disposed at a distance from the guide

tracks and deflection tracks (4, 5, 6, 24, 25, 37, 49) in
such a way that an essen
tially constant feed gap having
the thickness of the coins (2) to be conveyed is formed

between the guide tracks and deflection tracks (4, 5, 6,
24, 25, 37, 49) and the conveyor belt (7), and
in that devices (21, 33) for detecting the denomination
of and for counting the coins (2) and/or for

preliminarily sorting and conveying the coins (2) 
according to denomination and/or for removing foreign

coins are provided at the beginning of the lower
horizontal guide track (4) and at the end of the upper

horizontal guide track (25, 37, 49).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the upper horizontal guide track (37) is disposed on the

back of a plate (46) at a right angle to the vertical
guide track (5) disposed on the front of a plate (47) and

is provided with upper and lower guide rails (38, 39) and
is connected to two lateral guide rails (42) by means of

a connecting piece (41) disposed at 45Â°, the planes of
the two plates (46, 47) being disposed so as to be offset

from one another by an amount which is greater than the
thickness of the coins (2) to be conveyed, and in that

the upper conveyor belt (30) is fed round deflection
rollers (28) having vertical axes (40) on the back of the

plate (46) and is disposed parallel to the upper
horizontal guide track (37).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the upper horizontal guide track (49) is disposed at a

right angle to the vertical guide track (5) and has the
same guide plane for the coins (2).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that
there is disposed at the start of the upper horizontal

guide track (49) a baffle (53) for the coins (2) which is
formed from a projection (54) in the upper guide track

(51) and a depression (55) in the lower guide track (50).
