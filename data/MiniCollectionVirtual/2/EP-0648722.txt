<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates 
to a process for making alkyl substituted 
cyclopentadienes from cyclopentenones by reacting the cyclopentenone with a Grignard 
reagent followed by the acidification and dehydration of the resulting tertiary alcohol 
with a carboxylic acid. Alkyl substituted cyclopentadienes are used as monomers and in forming 
metallocenes of transition metals such as titanium, zirconium and hafnium. Such 
metallocenes are useful components of olefin polymerization catalysts, as is known in 
the art. The synthesis of 1-methyl-3-alkylcyclopentadienes by the reaction of 3-methyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one 
with alkyl Grignard reagents such as methyl, ethyl or 
isopropyl magnesium halides, followed by alcohol formation and dehydration using 
strong acids such as HCl or p-toluene sulfonic acid is described in the literature. These 
processes give about a 50/50 mixture of endo and exo isomers. The exo isomers are not 
useful in forming metallocenes such that when such isomer mixtures are used in making 
metallocenes, the yield of metallocene is less than 50%. We have now disclosed a 
process which favors the formation of the desirable endo isomers. In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for making 
an alkyl substituted cyclopentadiene, said process comprising reacting a cyclopentenone  
 
with an alkyl magnesium halide and then acidifying and dehydrating the resulting 
tertiary alcohol intermediate using an organic carboxylic acid, so as to form an alkyl 
substituted cyclopentadiene product which contains at least a 1.5/1 ratio of endo to exo 
isomers. Cyclopentenones for use in the process of the invention can be prepared 
from 1,4-diketones by the process described in U.S. Patent 5,276,199. Such diketones 
have the formula CH3COCH2CH2COCH2R where R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group 
which contains 1 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of hydrocarbon groups 
include alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, alkenyl, and substituted alkenyl 
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, 
pentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, pentenyl, benzyl, phenyl, and naphthyl. Preferred 
cyclopentenones for use in the process are 3-alkylcyclopent-2-en-1-ones such as 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one. Examples of alkyl magnesium halides (Grignard reagents) 
include C1 to C10 alkyl magnesium chlorides and bromides. Non-limiting examples of 
alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl and hexyl. Examples of organic carboxylic acids
