<ABSTRACT>
The shaft sequence is formed as link shafts (10) intermediately located on its links. The shaft pieces (10') being releasably connected at their ends with connecting parts of the links, and separately dismantlable between the intermediate bearings. On the machine frame (1) parallel to the shaft pieces of the link shafts, separately applicable and dismantlable bearing shafts can be fitted for the gear components.

<CLAIMS>
Assembly station with 

a stationary machine framework, 
a workpiece mount arranged thereon and preferably 
executed as a rotary plate, 
a plurality of manipulation units mountable on the 
machine framework in ring-formation relative to the 

workpiece mount for processing the workpiece and 
a central drive driving the manipulation units which 
is executed as a multiply angled shaft train arranged 

in the or at the machine framework and surrounding a 
vertical axis of the workpiece mount in arch form and 

carries transmission elements on its shaft parts for 
driving the manipulation units associated with the 

shaft parts 
 
characterised in that
 
the shaft train (10) is executed as a jointed shaft 

intermediately suspended at its joints, with the shaft 
parts (10') of the jointed shaft being provided at their 

ends with connection parts (10'') and being releasably 
connected to the joints and thus separately 

dismantleable between the intermediate bearings (13). 
Assembly station in accordance with claim 1
 
characterised in that
 
separately attachable as well as removable support axles 

(14) for transmission elements are attachable at the 
machine framework (1) parallel to the shaft parts (10') 

of the jointed shaft.  
 
Assembly station in accordance with one of the claims 1 
and 2
 
characterised in that
 
the machine framework (1) has a table plate (4) for the 

mounting of the manipulation units (15). 
Assembly station in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 3
 
characterised in that
 
the shaft train (10) is closed in ring-like manner.
