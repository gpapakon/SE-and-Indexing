A device for changing a couch into a bed, of a kind 
comprising a frame fixed against a wall inside which pivots 

a rigid plate constituting the base of a bed, characterised 
in that it comprises on one of the vertical uprights (2a) of 

the frame (2) a bracket (5) of which one of the arms (5a) is 
fixed relative to the rigid plate (4a) whereas the other arm 

(5b) cooperates with an inclined bar (7b) round which pivots 
a horizontal board (7c) forming the seat of the couch, while 

the back of the couch is realized by two vertical parallel 
sides (6) fixed to the lower outside face of the rigid plate 

(4a). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
arm (5b) of the bracket (5) has a rounded profile reinforced 

by a metallic plate (5c) which is in contact with another 
plate (7e) fixed to the upper rear margin of the board 

(7c). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
plate (4a) is fixed relative to the bracket (5) such that it 

can pivot about the same axis (5d) of rotation. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
arm (5a) of the bracket (5) cooperates with the stem of a 

piston (8a) of a jack (8) of which the body is fixed to the 
vertical uprights (2a) of the frame (2). 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
rounded profile of the arm (5b) of the bracket (5) is in 

permanent contact with the upper rear margin of the board 
(7c) of the couch (7).  

 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
plate (4a) comprises in its upper part and above the couch a 

swivelling foot (4c) permitting the support of the bed (4) 
when it is unfolded. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
plate (7e) and the reinforcement (5c) are provided to 

constitute a sticky or non-slip coupling in order to avoid 
the premature opening of the plate (4a).
