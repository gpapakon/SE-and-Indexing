<ABSTRACT>
To improve a waterproof performance of a front 
surface of a battery storing case in an electric 

vehicle. 
A cover structure for an electric vehicle 
wherein subcovers 54a and 96a are provided between a 

front fender 80 covering a front wheel and a front 
surface of a battery storing case, and a gap generating 

between the subcovers 54a and 96a and the fender 80 or 
the front surface of the battery storing case is formed 

like a maze so as to stop an upward flow of muddy water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric vehicle comprising
a battery storing case and a cover structure for said battery
storing case.The present applicant has already proposed a battery supporting
device for an electric vehicle in Japanese patent laid-open No.
5-112270, in which there is shown a motorcycle having a plurality
of batteries 15 arranged under a step floor 5. The batteries 15
are stored in a battery case 12. The battery case 12 is located
just behind a front wheel, so that muddy water splashed by the
front wheel directly strikes against the battery case 12.
Accordingly, the battery case 12 is required to have a strict
sealing structure.The document EP-A-0 469 995 discloses an electrically powered
vehicle
according to the preamble of claim 1,
wherein a battery frame is arranged behind a front wheel
of the vehicle and is surrounded by a cover. This cover extends
along the rear side of the battery frame, along the whole length 
of the battery frame, and along the front side of the battery
frame and upwards to a vehicle main frame portion located behind
and above the front wheel. Further, the front wheel is covered
substantially at the upper side thereof by a fender.It is an object of the present invention to provide an electric
vehicle comprising a relatively simple cover structure for a
battery storing case, wherein the cover structure prevents water
from entering the battery storing case.According to the present invention, there is provided an electric
vehicle according to claim 1.The subcover functions to receive water splashed by the wheel and
the gap relating to the subcover forms a maze structure; thereby
the water is prevented from entering the battery storing case and
an upward flow of the water splashed by the wheel is stopped
thereby.As described above, according to the present invention, in a cover
structure for an electric vehicle having a battery storing case
provided behind a wheel, a subcover is provided between a fender
covering the wheel and a front surface or front cover of the
battery storing case, and a gap extends between the fender and the
front surface or front cover of the battery storing case, which
is formed like a maze so as to stop an upward flow of water.
Accordingly, the entry of the water splashed by the wheel into the
battery storing case can be effectively prevented. Advantageous developments of the inventive vehicle are given in
the dependent claims.Especially there can be provided an electric vehicle as defined
by claim 6. Accordingly, the muddy water

end (54b) of the subcover (96a, 54a) disposed in said gap is

bent towards the front side of the vehicle.
An electric vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
subcover (96a, 54a) is formed by front portions of battery

side covers (96, 54), which are bent towards the transverse
center of the vehicle and are secured together.
An electric vehicle according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein
said subcover (96a, 54a) comprises a first subcover (96a) and

a second subcover (54a),

said first subcover (96a) being closely mounted on the front
fender (80) and disposed closely before the second subcover

(54a),
 
said second subcover (54a) being disposed just before the

lower end of the battery case front surface or front cover
(55) and having an upper end (54b) extending into the gap.
An electric vehicle according to claim 4, wherein said first
subcover (96a) is overlapped with the lower end of the fender

(80).
An electric vehicle according to any of claims 1 - 5, wherein
said battery storing case (10) comprises a bottom plate (38)

on which a battery (35) is placed, right and left ends of
said bottom plate (38) are in close contact with battery case

side covers (54), a rear end (38a) of said bottom plate (38)
is in close contact with a vehicular frame (2), and a front

end (38b) of said bottom plate (38) is separate from said
vehicular frame (2) to define a passage space therebetween,

said passage space comprising a first passage portion (156)
having one end exposed into said battery storing case (10)

and a second passage portion (157) having one end connected
to another end of said first passage portion (156) and

another end opened to an outside of said battery storing case
(10), said second end of said second passage portion (157)

being directed in rearward direction.
An electric vehicle according to claim 6, wherein said bottom
plate comprises a corrugated plate (38), and a portion (157)

of said passage (156, 157) is formed between a crest and a
trough of said corrugated plate (38).
