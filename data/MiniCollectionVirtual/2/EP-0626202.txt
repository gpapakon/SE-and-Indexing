<ABSTRACT>
A known comminuting device for industrial and/or domestic waste and scrap metal in particular having a casing with a material feeding region and a material discharging region and having a rotor which is provided with comminuting tools and can be rotated about a horizontal spindle which is accommodated by the casing, the comminuting tools interacting with abutments situated on the casing in order to effect comminution, is to be further or additionally developed in such a way that peak power values which occur during the comminution process, are markedly greater than the mean power requirement necessary and cause the device to be overloaded during continuous operation are suppressed as far as possible. To achieve this, the material feeding region (9) is provided beneath the horizontal plane containing the rotor spindle (2), the said region (9) being followed, in the direction of rotation of the rotor (3) at a level which is lower than that of the material feeding region (9), by a material outlet (10) which replaces or complements the material discharging region (12).
