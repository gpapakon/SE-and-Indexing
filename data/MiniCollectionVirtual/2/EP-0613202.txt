<ABSTRACT>
A method for reactivating and recovering electrolyte cells by drilling a hole (14) 
through the battery case (10) and injecting a volume of electrolyte liquid into the case for 

absorption into the cell separator material. The battery is subjected to multiple 
charge/discharge cycles while the cell opening remains unsealed, and is subjected to a 

final charge prior to sealing the drilled hole through the cell outer case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
recovering the recharge life cycle of sealed liquid 
electrolyte batteries. In particular, the invention 
relates to a method for recovering nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) 
cells which have degraded to the point where they no 
longer accept or are capable of holding a voltage charge. 
The preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to 
Ni-Cd batteries, but the principles of the invention are 
equally applicable to other sealed liquid electrolyte 
rechargeable batteries, such as nickel-metal-hydride, or 
rechargeable alkaline batteries. All batteries contain an electrolyte of one form or 
another. The purpose is to provide a medium in which 
ions move freely from one electrode to another, thereby 
allowing current flow. Both the volume and strength of 
the electrolyte are important to the proper operation of 
the battery. As long as the electrolyte parameters stay 
within fairly wide limits, operation is not impaired, but 
if either the volume or strength of the electrolyte move 
outside of these fairly wide limits, the battery 
operation degrades. In a Ni-Cd battery and many other 
batteries, this electrolyte takes the form of a liquid 
solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) which is soaked 
into the insulating material and in contact with the 
battery electrodes. The invention is primarily concerned with 
rechargeable batteries of the general type which may be 
discharged at peak current drains up to 10-20 amps (A) 
but typically operate between 0.05 and 10 ampere hour 
(Ah) capacities. The charging of such batteries is 
typically accomplished at a charge rate of 0.1-1 amps. 
The charge and discharge rate of batteries is frequently 
referred to as the "C-rate," which is defined as the 
current flow out of or into a cell numerically equal to  
 
the cells rated capacity. For example, the C-rate of a 
1-Ah cell is 1 A; the C-rate of a 2.5-Ah cell is 2.5 A. 
The C-rate concept is useful to enable a comparison of 
different size cells on the basis of a scaling of charge 
and discharge rates, for different cells behave similarly 
in terms of their voltage and operation time when they 
are charged or discharged at the same C-rate. The Ni-Cd 
batteries can operate with discharge rates up to 20 C, 
and are typically recharged at rates of 0.02 C - 0.3 C. A Ni-Cd battery is typically constructed of a 
tightly wrapped coil of materials consisting of a cadmium 
plate, a nickel plate and a porous insulating material 
separating the plates, which material is impregnated

<CLAIMS>
A method of reactivating a spent electrolyte battery cell comprising a top (70) and 
a outer case (10) enclosing a cell interior having a original electrolyte capacity, and a 

electrode (72) projecting from the top of the cell, characterised by: 

a) forming an opening into the cell interior and through the outer case of the cell; 
b) injecting a volume of electrolyte into the opening; 
c) absorbing the injected electrolyte into the cell interior for at least six days; 
d) removing accumulated gases from the cell interior by subjecting the cell to 
repeated substantially equal electrical charge/discharge cycles; and 
e) sealing the opening through the outer case of the cell. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the number of charge/discharge cycles is at least 
three. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the step of injecting further comprises 
injecting about 30% of the cell's original electrolyte capacity. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the step of forming an opening further 
comprises drilling. 
The method claim 4, wherein the step of drilling further comprises drilling a hole 
of approximately .020 inch in diameter. 
The method of claim 5, wherein the step of drilling further comprises drilling 
through the cell case at a location substantially near the top of the cell. 
The method of claim 6, wherein the hole is drilled substantially to the centre of 
the cell. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of absorbing 
further comprises periodically turning the cell along its axis. 
The method of claim 8, wherein the step of absorbing further comprises 
absorbing for a period in the range of 6-14 days. 
The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of sealing the 
cell further comprises filling the opening through the outer case with solder.
