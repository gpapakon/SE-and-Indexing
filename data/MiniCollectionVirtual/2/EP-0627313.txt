<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet head includes a plurality of 
electrothermal transducers for producing thermal 

energy contributable to ink ejection; a storing device 
for storing image data for the electrothermal 

transducers; a switching device for switching 
energization periods for the electrothermal 

transducers in accordance with the image data stored 
in the storing device; wherein during recording 

operation using the electrothermal transducers, when 
an image datum stored in the storing device is a first 

datum instructing recording, the switching device 
supplies to the corresponding electrothermal 

transducer a first drive signal for preliminary ink 
heating and a second drive signal for ejecting the 

ink, and when the image datum is a second datum not 
instructing recording, the switching device supplies 

the first drive signal to the corresponding 
electrothermal transducer element and does not supply 

the second drive signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording head for ejecting ink droplet through an
ejection outlet or ejection outlets using thermal
energy and an ink jet recording apparatus using the
ink jet recording head.In an ink jet recording apparatus, droplets
of ink are formed through one of various processes, and
the droplets are deposited on a recording material
such as recording paper or the like to effect the
recording. Among the various processes, an ink jet
recording process using thermal energy for the droplet
formation is advantageous in that multi-nozzle
structure at high density can be easily accomplished,
and therefore, high resolution and high quality image
can be provided at high speed.In one type of ink jet recording apparatus, a
recording head is used in which a plurality of droplet
formation means for electing ink droplets through
ejection outlets by thermal energy applied to the ink,
that is, the droplet formation means having
electrothermal transducer element for heating the ink
by being supplied with current pulses, and integration
circuit (driver IC) for driving the electrothermal 
transducers, are formed on a common substrate.Referring to Figure 8, there is shown an
example of such an ink jet recording head and a
driver. Figure 9 illustrates drive timing therefor.
In Figure 9, designated by a reference numeral 2 are
electrothermal transducers corresponding to ink
ejection outlets 13 (not shown). The same number of
record data (SI) as the number of the electrothermal
transducer 2, are sequentially transferred in
synchronism with data transfer clock (CLK) into shift
registers 4 in the driver IC3 by an image data
generating circuit 22, as shown in Figure 9. The
record data thus transferred are read in a latch
circuit in accordance with input of latch signals
(LAT). Thereafter, in accordance with divided drive
signals (EI) and divided drive signal transfer clock
(CEK), the driver IC3 is sequentially rendered active
in response to flip-flop (F/F) 6. The electrothermal
transducers 2 for which the record data signals for
the driver IC3 are on, are selectively energized in
the order shown in Figure 9, only during on-state of
the pulse width setting signal (ENB), by which the ink
is ejected through the associated ejection outlets 13.In such an apparatus, a bubble is created in
the ink in response to energization of the
electrothermal transducer element, and the pressure
produced by the bubble creation is used to eject the 
ink from the recording head to effect the recording.
Therefore,
