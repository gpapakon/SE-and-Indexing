<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (75) for treating a tissue lining of a mammalian body cavity, particularly a uterine endometrium comprising a pump (38) and a distendable bladder (10) connected to a catheter. The apparatus is introduced into the body cavity and the bladder is distended by introducing a non-toxic fluid under pressure. The fluid is heated by a heating element (20). A pump (38) circulates the fluid within the distendable bladder to help keep the fluid at a uniform temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HEATED BALLOON MEDICAL APPARATUSI FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to an apparatus for treating the tissue lining of a human body cavity, particularly the endometrium of the uterus. More specifically, the apparatus of the present invention may be a self- contained closed- luid system which can minimize the volume of fluid introduced into the area being treated in the event of a distendable bladder rupture or other failure. A heating means and a pump means may be incorporated in a handle portion of the apparatus so- as to provide an improved device for treatment of tissues lining a body cavity without many of the disadvantages and dangerous features of known techniques.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe following terms as used herein have the meaning given below:"Cauterization" means the application of heat to 5 tissue in an amount sufficient to destroy the tissue."Necrosis" means the death of cells in tissue."Endometrium" is that portion of the inner lining of the uterus to which an embryo normally attaches and excludes the portions of the uterine inner lining forming 10 the cervix, to which the embryo usually does not attach.Apparatus and methods for cauterization of the endometrium of a mammalian uterus, useful in sterilization procedures and cancer treatments, are well known. Thermal and cryogenic treatments have been <f| 15 utilized in such cauterization techniques and typically involve either the direct or indirect application of heat or cold to the tissue to be treated.For example, a laser hysteroscope has been used to cauterize the endometrial layer of the uterus. This laser 20 treatment suffers from several disadvantages. It requires the application of a large amount of thermal energy to a 

relatively small area of tissue to produce intense heat even though such a large amount of heat may not be necessary to effectively cauterize the tissue. Further, this laser treatment requires the physician to continually reposition the hysteroscope within the uterus in order to treat the entire endometrium. Such internal manipulation of a laser hysteroscope within the uterus of a patient is both difficult, requiring a significant level of skill to perform, and potentially dangerous. Accidental puncture of the uterine or tissue wall may result from manipulation of the laser hysteroscope within the uterus or body cavity, and tissue layers beneath the endometrium may be burned if the laser's beam is left focused on one area of tissue for too long a period of time.A variety of alternatives to laser
