<ABSTRACT>
An elongated anode structure having multiple points to which electrons are 
attracted is provided. The anode can be constructed of multiple wire brushes 

that are attached to a metal rod. Use of the anode in magnetron systems 
significantly reduces dielectric material build-up and improves film uniformity in 

both dc reactive and non-reactive sputtering. Moreover, the anode reduces 
overheating and increases the operation time of magnetron systems undergoing 

reactive sputtering of dielectric materials. In one embodiment, the magnetron 

system has a cylindrical cathode and a pair of elongated anodes positioned 
parallel to and equidistance from the cathode. The anode structure is particularly 

suited for sputtering uniform films of dielectric materials, including silicon 
dioxide and silicon nitride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus for depositing films
on a substrate, and more particularly to a reactive magnetron sputtering device
for depositing dielectric materials onto substrates in which the
dielectric films have uniform thickness and in which the apparatus can operate
continuously for long periods.Sputtering is the physical ejection of material from a target as a result of ion
bombardment of the target. The ions are usually created by collisions between
gas atoms and electrons in a glow discharge. The ions are accelerated into the
target cathode by an electric field. A substrate is placed in a suitable location
so that it intercepts a portion of the ejected atoms. Thus, a coating of target
material is deposited on the surface of the substrate.In an endeavour to attain increased deposition rates, magnetically enhanced
targets have been used. In a planar magnetron, the cathode includes an array
of permanent magnets arranged in a closed loop and mounted in a fixed position
in relation to the flat target plate. Thus, the magnetic field is caused to travel in
a closed loop, commonly referred to as a "race track", which establishes the
path or region along which sputtering or erosion of the target material takes
place. In a magnetron cathode, a magnetic field confines the glow discharge
plasma and increases the path length of the electrons moving under the
influence of the electric field. This results in an increase in the gas atom-electron
collision probability. This leads to a much higher sputtering rate than
that obtained without the use of magnetic confinement. Further, the sputtering
process can be accomplished at a much lower gas pressure.In dc reactive sputtering, a reactant gas forms a compound with the material
which is sputtered from the target plate. When the target plate is silicon, and
the reactive gas is oxygen, silicon dioxide is formed on the surface of the
substrate. However, because silicon dioxide is such a good insulator, a film
thick enough to cause arcing is rapidly formed in areas of the target plate
outside of the race track. Silicon dioxide is known to be one of the most
difficult dielectric films to deposit by magnetron reactive sputtering because of 
this characteristic. The arcing associated with silicon dioxide has prevented planar
magnetron reactive sputtering from being efficiently utilised to deposit quality silicon dioxide
films.Another technique for coating silicon based compounds onto substrates involves reactive
sputtering with a cylindrical
