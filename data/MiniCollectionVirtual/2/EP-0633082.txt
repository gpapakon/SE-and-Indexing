<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum casting apparatus in which a molding 
cavity (6) is reduced in pressure substantially to a vacuum, 

and upon opening a gate (10), a molten metal which has been 
raised to a molten metal retaining dome (8) is charged into 

the molding cavity (6) via a runner (14) at a high speed. 
The runner (14) has a first portion (50) making a pool of 

molten metal, a second portion (56) connecting the molten 
metal retaining dome (8) to the first portion (50), and a 

third portion (58) connecting the first portion (50) to the 
molding cavity (6). A pin (52) is slidably provided in the 

first portion (50) of the runner (14). An opening of the 
second portion (56) of the runner to the first portion (50) 

is located nearer to the pin (52) than an opening of the 
third portion (58) of the runner to the first portion (50). 

When the pin (52) is moved into the first portion (50) of 
the runner, the pin (52) first closes the opening (60) of 

the second portion (56) and then begins to apply pressure 
the molten metal in the molding cavity (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum casting
apparatus in which a molding cavity is reduced in pressure
substantially to a vacuum and upon opening a gate, a molten
metal is charged into the molding cavity at a high speed due
to the resultant pressure difference.As one example of a casting apparatus capable of
casting products of a high quality and a low cost, a vacuum
casting apparatus (named by the present applicant as a
Vacuum Precharged Closed squeezed casting apparatus) was
proposed by the present applicant in Japanese Patent
Publication HEI 2-155557.The proposed casting apparatus includes a molding
cavity which can be reduced in pressure substantially to a
vacuum, a molten metal supply passage, a gate piston for
opening and shutting a passage communicating the molding
cavity with the molten metal supply passage, and a pressure
pin assembled in the gate piston. In the proposed casting
apparatus, the
pressure in the
molding cavity is reduced to a
vacuum. Then, the gate piston is opened to charge a molten
metal from the molten metal supply passage into the molding
cavity at a high speed. The gate piston is then closed to
shut the molding cavity filled with the molten metal, and 
the pressure pin is operated to pressurize the molten metal
in the molding cavity before the molten metal solidifies.
In this apparatus, since the molding cavity is at a vacuum,
the mixing of air in the molten metal is prevented, so that
casting defects due to bubbles in the metal are avoided.
Further, since the charging speed is high, running of the
molten metal in the molding cavity is improved and the
production of slimmer cast products is made possible.However, the following problems yet remain with
the above-described vacuum casting apparatus:First, since the mechanism for shutting the
molding cavity from the molten metal supply passage and the
mechanism for pressurizing the molten metal in the molding
cavity are separate from each other, provision of both
mechanisms is accompanied by a restriction in space for
providing both mechanisms, an increase in cost, and
complication of structure.Second, since the gate piston shutting process is
not followed by the pressurizing process in a continuous
fashion, it is difficult to properly determine the timing
for initiating the pressurizing step appropriately. For
example, if the pressurizing is initiated too early, the
pressure pin would operate before the molding cavity was
shut, so that pressurization would be impossible. On the
other hand, if the pressurization is
