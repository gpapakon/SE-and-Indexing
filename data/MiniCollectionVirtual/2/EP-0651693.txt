<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for separating individual dies (14) from a wafer (32) in which the wafer is adhered to a plastic film (26) on a film carrier (16) with the circuit side of the wafer facing the film (26). In this manner, the circuitry is protected from dust, and trauma from the sawing and cleaning processes because the circuitry is sealed between the film and the non-circuit side of the wafer. A punching station is programmed to punch holes (28) in the film (26) in a pattern corresponding to the relative positions of the microstructures on the wafer (32). Sets of alignment holes (30a) and (30b) are punched in the film (26) such that they will be beyond the perimeter of the wafer (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a method and apparatus
for separating individual integrated circuit dies from a
wafer containing a plurality of dies. More particularly, the
present invention pertains to a method and apparatus for
sawing a wafer containing extremely fragile componentry.In the fabrication of microchips for use in the
electronics and computer industries, a wafer is typically
fabricated which comprises a plurality of individual dies (or
chips) commonly arranged in a grid pattern. The sections of
a wafer between the individual dies are termed streets.
FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate an exemplary wafer 10. FIG. 1A is
a plan view of a wafer, while FIG. 1B is an enlarged view of
section A in FIG. 1A. Reference numerals 14 denote
individual dies and reference numerals 12 denote the streets
separating the individual dies 14. Streets 12 are simply
areas of the wafer where no componentry has been placed and
which define the boundaries of each individual die 14. The
integrated circuitry and other componentry appears on only
one surface, e.g., surface 15, of the wafer. The opposing
surface (not shown in FIG. 1) is blank.The individual dies 14 comprising a wafer are removed
from the wafer by sawing through the wafer along all of the
streets, thus physically separating the wafer in both axes
into the individual dies.Standard industry practice for separating each wafer up
into individual dies is described below.First, the wafer 10 is placed upside down (i.e., with the
circuit side 15 of the wafer 14 facing downwardly and the
non-circuit circuit side facing upwardly) on a flat surface. 
A metal film frame defining an opening is laid over the wafer
with the wafer being within the perimeter of the opening in
the film frame. A plastic film is then laid over the metal
film frame and back (non-circuit side) of the wafer.
Preferably, the plastic film is coated with adhesive on the
side which contacts the film frame and the back of the
wafer. Force is then applied between the film and the film
frame to cause the film to adhere well to the frame. One
possible technique for applying the force is to pass a
rolling pin over the wafer and film frame to adhere the film
to the back side of the wafer and to the surface of the film
frame. The wafer is now mounted to the film which, in turn,
is mounted to the film frame.The wafer, film, and film frame combination (hereinafter
the film frame assembly) is then turned over so that the
circuitry on the top of the wafer now faces upwards. The
film frame assembly is then placed
