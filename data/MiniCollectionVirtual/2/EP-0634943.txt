<ABSTRACT>
A dilatation balloon catheter (10) includes a shaft (12) having a proximal outer tube section and a distal outer tube section. The proximal outer tube section (40) is formed from a tubular braid of a stainless steel member, which is encased in a polymer material such as polyimide. The pick count of the braid may be increased along the proximal outer tube section toward its distal end in order to increase flexibility. The distal outer tube section (42) is a tube made of a polymer material, such as a high density polyethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dilatation catheter for use in
angioplasty
according to the precharacterizing part of claim 1 as shown from EP-A-0249338.
Angioplasty has gained wide acceptance as an efficient and effective
method of opening stenoses in the vascular system. In the most widely used form of
angioplasty, a dilatation balloon catheter is guided through the vascular system until
a balloon, which is mounted at the distal end of the catheter shaft, is positioned
across the stenosis. The balloon is then inflated to open the artery and reestablish
acceptable blood flow.Dilatation catheters can generally be divided into those which are fed
over a guide wire (i.e., "over the -wire" catheters) and those catheters which serve as
their own guide wire (i.e., "fixed-wire" catheters). Both types of catheters have
advantages and disadvantages.Innerless dilatation balloon catheters have been developed in an
attempt to obtain some of the advantages of a fixed-wire catheter while still retaining
the advantages of an over-the-wire catheter. These innerless catheters feature a shaft
having a single lumen which acts as both an inflation lumen and a guide wire lumen.
A lumen extension extends through the balloon, which is mounted on the distal end
of the shaft. The shaft lumen is in fluid communication with the interior of the
balloon. The guide wire extends through the shaft lumen, the lumen extension and
out the distal end of the balloon.Examples of innerless dilatation balloon catheters are shown in U.S.
Patents 5,032,113 and 5,035,705 by Matthew M. Burns.When used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA),
the dilatation catheter is typically advanced through a guide catheter to the aorta.
Using fluoroscopy, the physician manipulates the catheter until the balloon is located
across the stenosis. This may involve the use of a guide wire over which the
catheter is moved. Alternatively, the catheter may act as its own guide wire,
depending upon the particular design. The manipulation of the dilatation catheter
through the guide catheter and through the coronary arteries to the stenosis requires 
the dilatation catheter to have a number of different, sometimes conflicting,
characteristics.For example, a successful dilatation catheter must offer flexibility so
that the catheter can maneuver through tight curvatures of the vascular system. A
dilatation catheter also must allow the physician to transmit longitudinal force along
the dilation catheter from its proximal end to its distal end so the
