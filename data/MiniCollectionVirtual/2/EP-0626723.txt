<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
device manufacturing method using an encapsulating resin 
sheet, its manufacturing device, encapsulating resin 
sheet using the manufacturing method, and its 
manufacturing method. Conventionally, a semiconductor device of resin 
encapsulating type was encapsulated by a transfer 
molding method. The transfer molding method is explained as 
follows:
 
   More specifically, uncured resin such as epoxy 
molding material mainly containing epoxy resin and 
filler is heated and melted. Then, the melted resin is 
cast into a mold by a transfer molding machine, and 
molded in a high temperature and high pressure state to 
cure resin. Thereby, a semiconductor chip mounted on a 
lead frame is encapsulated. The semiconductor device of resin encapsulating 
type manufactured by the above method has a good 
reliability since the semiconductor chip is completely 
coated with an epoxy resin composition. Also, epoxy 
resin is precisely molded by the mold, a good appearance 
of a package can be obtained. For these reasons, almost 
all the semiconductor devices of resin encapsulating 
type have recently been manufactured by this method. In recent years, the enlargement of the package of  
 
the semiconductor device of resin encapsulating type has 
been developed due to the enlargement of the chip in 
accordance with the high integration of the semiconductor 
device. On the other hand, there is a strong tendency 
that the package will be thinned in accordance with the 
reduction of a mounting space. This tendency is 
considered to be considerably increased in the future. 
Also, since the types of the packages are diversified, 
it will be expected that the manufacture cannot be 
sufficiently performed b the conventional transfer 
molding method. Under this circumstances, there has 
been desired the development of a flexible production 
system, which is the production of the semiconductor 
device of resin encapsulating type in many types and 
small quantities. In consideration of the above point, there has been 
proposed a method for manufacturing a semiconductor 
device of resin encapsulating type using an 
encapsulating resin sheet. FIGS. 10A to 10C are views showing an example the 
manufacturing method using the encapsulating resin 
sheet, and FIGS. 10A to 10C are cross sectional views 
each showing a main process. In FIGS. 10A to 10C, reference numeral 100 is a 
semiconductor chip; 102: a TAB film; 104: a lead formed 
on the film 102, and 106: a bump electrode formed on
