<ABSTRACT>
A detergent composition comprising a salt (A) of an N-acyl derivative of an amino acid selected from glycine, 
clanine and β-alanine and a salt (B) of a higher fatty acid in a weight ratio of component (A) to component (B) of 

99.5/0.5 to 90/10, wherein the acyl residue is a residue of a C₈-C₂₀ (un)saturated fatty acid; and another detergent 
composition which contains a higher alcohol and/or a polyhydric alcohol in addition to the above components. The 

invention serves to improve the performance of N-acylated amino acid salts as the detergent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a detergent composition which
comprises an N-acyl glycine salt, an N-acyl alanine salt and/or
an N-acyl β-alanine salt, together with a higher fatty acid
salt, and to another detergent composition whose use feeling is
improved by incorporating further a higher alcohol and/or a
polyhydric alcohol.N-Acyl amino acid salts are known as surface active agents
generally having high safety, and, particularly, N-acyl glutamic
acid salts, N-acyl sarcosine salts, N-acyl β-alanine salts, N-acyl
methyl taurine salts and the like are broadly used in
detergents. Other N-acyl amino acid salts have also been
studied since considerably old times, and N-acyl amino acids
were actually synthesized from and examined on natural amino
acids and synthetically obtainable amino acids. Especially,
there are a number of reports on the results of studies on N-acyl
derivatives of natural amino acids.Recently, it was reported that scum formed by the reaction
of an N-acyl glycine salt, an N-acyl β-alanine salt or the like
with calcium contained in city water was found to have an
excellent touch (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai)
No. Hei 4-221607). However, the N-acyl amino acid salts 
disclosed in this report and other natural type N-acyl amino
acid salts were not sufficient in their bubble-related
performances in terms of bubble retention, creaminess, lathering
power and sliminess.The firm's brochure "Hampshire Hamposyl Surfactants" by
W. R. Grace Ltd. (1989) shows that N-acyl-N-methylglycine
salts were used as surfactants for a broad range of
applications. The combination of 5 and 10% sodium lauroyl
sarcosinate with 95% and 90% soap respectively has been
described.EP-A-460566 discloses a liquid detergent composition
containing a potassium or alkanol amine salt of β-alanine
(A') and in addition thereto a surfactant (B') in a ratio of
(A')/(B') of 99/1 to 1/1.The object of the present invention is to provide an
excellent detergent composition comprising an N-acyl amino acid
salt, which is highly safe and shows quick, effective and creamy
lathering and reduced slimy touch to the skin.With the aim of achieving the aforementioned object, the
inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive
studies and found as the result that an excellent detergent
composition having the aforementioned properties can be provided
by jointly using a salt of a specified N-acyl amino acid and a
salt of a specified higher fatty acid, or by blending them
further with a specified higher alcohol and/or polyhydric
