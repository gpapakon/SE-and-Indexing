<ABSTRACT>
Intra-aortic balloon catheters for placement using an indwelling guide wire having guide 
structures which reduce the size of the catheter, which can increase distal perfusion and 

facilitate insertion and placement. These guide structures include short internal or 

external lumens, formed from separate guide sleeves (15, 25, 73) or by the method of 
wrapping the balloon membrane (7) itself. The guide sleeves (15, 25, 73) can be 

located on or inside the balloon membrane (7) or can be attached to the balloon tip or 
catheter tube (3), and can be permanent or detachable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intra-aortic balloon ("IAB") 
catheters used to perform intra-aortic balloon pumping 
("IABP"). More particularly, it pertains to novel 
intra-aortic balloon catheters which have a single 
lumen, yet which can still be used with an indwelling 
guide wire. Life-threatening cardiac problems may reduce the 
ability of a patient's heart to pump blood. When the 
heart continues pumping, albeit in a weakened manner, 
the weakened heart may be benefitted by lessening the 
load thereon. One popular support system which can assist a weakened 
heart is intra-aortic balloon pumping ("IABP"). IABP 
is performed using a non-distensible balloon (the 
"IAB") which has been positioned in the patient's 
aorta. By filling the balloon with fluid it can be 
controllably expanded, and by removing the fluid it can 
be deflated. Fluid exchange is accomplished through a  
 
catheter running from the balloon out of the patient's 
body. In many instances, particularly whenever the IAB is to 
be used in a patient suffering from sclerotic disease, 
or a patient in which the blood vessels through which 
the IAB will pass are highly tortuous, a thin, flexible 
guide wire may first be used to negotiate a path to the 
site where the IAB is to be placed, which may be the 
descending aorta. Once the guide wire is properly 
positioned, it serves as a path leading the IAB to the 
proper site. Of course, the catheter must be designed 
to cooperate with the guide wire. Known IAB catheters suitable for use with a guide wire 
are constructed with a second lumen through which the 
flexible guide wire passes, and are commonly referred 
to as "dual-lumen catheters". Examples of dual-lumen 
catheters are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,261,339, 
to Hanson et al. Typically, this second lumen 
communicates with an opening at the distal tip of the 
IAB balloon. The second lumen and guide wire are 
dimensioned to allow relative lengthwise motion 
therebetween. To position this type of IAB, the guide 
wire is inserted into the patient and advanced into the 
patient's aorta, using known medical procedures which 
need not be described. The guide wire is long enough 
so that a length of wire extends outward from the 
patient. Either before or during the medical 
procedure, the proximal end of the guide wire is 
inserted into the guide wire lumen through the opening 
at the distal tip of the balloon. Now, the IAB is 
advanced along the guide wire and into the patient 
through either an insertion sheath located in a 
puncture or
