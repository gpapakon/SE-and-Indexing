<ABSTRACT>
A buffer zone (56) disposed between the TOBI 
discharge cavity (50) and the forward rotor cavity (42) 

of a gas turbine engine serves to maintain the TOBI air 
relatively pollutant free by judiciously controlling the 

flow to maintain the pressure of the buffer cavity (56) 
below the adjacent cavities. The buffer cavity air and 

the forward rotor cavity air are bled to the dead rim 
area (90) of the turbine rotor disk (44) through 

tangentially oriented discharge ports (88) formed in the 
circumferentially spaced plenums (80) formed in the 

stator support. Plates (82) on the bottom of some of 
the plenums (80) bloc
k off the flow from the forward 
rotor cavity (42) and buffer air from the buffer cavity 

(56) flows through these closed off plenums (80) through 
openings (84) to maintain the proper pressure 

relationship amongst the cavities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thrust balancing for gas
turbine engines and particularly to a thrust balancing
system by creating pressurized cavities adjacent the
tangential on-board injector (TOBI) and preventing the
air of the TOBI from becoming polluted.As is well known thrust balancing in a twin spool,
axial flow, gas turbine engine is manifested by
controlling the leakage of certain seals between the
adjacent cavities to attain predetermined pressure
levels. Typically, the cavity adjacent the TOBI is one
of the cavities that is utilized to maintain this thrust
balancing relationship. The TOBI, which sometimes is
referred to by other names, serves to direct accelerated
cooling air tangentially to the turbine for the purpose
of cooling the turbine disks and turbine blades.TOBIs utilized to inject cooling air to the turbine
rotor of a gas turbine engine are aptly described in
U.S. Patent No. 4,822,244 granted to Maier et al on
April 18, 1989 entitled "TOBI" and U.S. Patent No.
4,730,978 granted to Baran, Jr. on March 15, 1988
entitled "Cooling Air Manifold For A Gas Turbine
Engine", both of which are assigned to United
Technologies Corporation, the applicant in this patent
application. Also U.S. Patent No. 3,989,410 granted to
Ferrari on November 2, 1976 entitled "Labyrinth Seal
System" discloses an accelerator (another name for TOBI)
that likewise directs cooling air tangentially to the
turbine rotor. For further details of the TOBI
throughout this patent application reference should be
made to these aforementioned patents.In the engine configuration disclosed in the latter
patent the thrust balancing is occasioned by maintaining 
the pressure level in two adjacent cavities to be
identical and allowing the flow leakage across the seal
between the two cavities to migrate in either direction.
Hence the flow in either cavity can migrate to the other
depending on the pressure levels in these adjacent
cavities. If foreign particles are in the upstream
cavity this foreign matter can flow into the downstream
cavity and ultimately into the internal cooling passages
of the turbine blades. Additionally, this leakage air
could eventually mix with TOBI air so as to cause the
TOBI air to be at a temperature and pressure that is
less than ideal. Additional means would have to be
provided to compensate for this adverse condition which
otherwise would result in a deficit in engine operating
performance.In other engine configurations, specialized and
expensive complex seals were employed adjacent the
engine shaft in
