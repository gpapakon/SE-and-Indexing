<ABSTRACT>
A method of storing liquid in a tank (101), the tank having inlet and outlet ports (117, 127) and a moveable follower (111) carrying one of the ports (117), the liquid being concurrently and continuously fed to and delivered from the tank and the volume of the liquid in the tank varying as the follower (111) moves in response to variations in the rates of supply and demand.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of storing a liquid in a tankField of the InventionThis invention relates to a method of operating storage tanks for liquids, more particularly to a method of continuous operation, and in particular for liquids which have time-dependent properties.Background of the InventionIt is common for liquids in a chemical process plant to be held in and pass through a tank or series of tanks between processing operations. Such tanks may be called (among other names) storage tanks, buffer tanks, intermediate tanks or capacity tanks. They may be operated continuously or discontinuously (batchwise) . In continuous operation, the liquid is substantially continuously supplied to and substantially continuously extracted from the tank. It is common for continuously-operated tanks to be equipped with an instrumental level measurement and control system, so that the volume or the residence time of the liquid stored in the tank can be controlled. The instrumental system may be designed so that normal variations in demand cause a signal to be sent to earlier stages in the process where the signal acts to produce corresponding variations in supply. This is known as feedback control. Continuously- operated storage tanks can also be equipped with control systems which respond to more extreme variations, for example temporary cessation of supply or demand, and therefore act as buffer or surge tanks. If supply is temporarily interrupted, then demand can be fulfilled for a limited time from the volume of liquid stored in the tank. If demand is temporarily interrupted, then supply can continue at the same or a reduced rate using the excess capacity of the tank for storage until demand is restored. 

 Certain liquids have time-dependent properties, and it is desirable to control their residence time in a process plant on the microscopic as well as the macroscopic scale. Examples of such liquids include polymer dopes for the manufacture of regenerated cellulose articles, for example fibres and films. Examples of this type of liquid include solutions of cellulose in tertiary amine N-oxides, for example, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, which are useful in the manufacture of regenerated cellulose articles such as fibres and films. It is desirable to minimise the residence time of these solutions in a manufacturing plant, and to ensure uniform and consistent flow so that stagnation is avoided. Another example of such a liquid is viscose. This is prepared by dissolving sodium cellulose xanthate in aqueous sodium hydroxide; filtered;

CLAIMS
1. A method of storing liquid in a tank, having an end and at least one wall, an inlet port whereby the liquid is fed to the tank from a source of supply and an outlet port whereby the liquid is delivered from the tank to a source of demand, the volume of the liquid being defined by the end of the tank, the at least one wall and a moveable follower within the tank, one of the ports being situate in or near the end of the tank and the other of the ports being attached to and moveable with the moveable follower, characterised in that the liquid is concurrently and continuously fed to and delivered from the tank, the volume of the liquid in the tank varying in response to variations in the rates of the supply and the demand.
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the moveable follower is a piston sealing with the at least one wall of the tank.
3. A method according to Claim 2, characterised in that external pressure is applied to the piston.
4. A method according to Claim 3, characterised in that the external pressure is applied to the piston through a central rod.
5. A method according to any preceding Claim, characterised in that the port attached to and moveable with the moveable follower is connected to the source of supply or to the source of demand by means of telescopic tubing.
6. . A method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the telescopic tubing is immersed in the liquid and passes through the end of the tank.
7. A method according to any preceding Claim, characterised in that the port attached to and moveable with 


the moveable follower is pivotally attached to the moveable follower.
8. A method according to any preceding Claim, characterised in that the volume of the liquid in the tank is controlled by regulation of the rate of supply responsive to movement of the moveable follower.
9. A method according to any of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the rate of supply is regulated by a volumetric metering pump.
10. A method according to any preceding Claim, characterised in that the rate of demand is regulated by a volumetric metering pump.
11. A method according to any preceding Claim, characterised in that the liquid in the tank is in a substantially laminar flow regime.
12. A method according to any preceding Claim, characterised in that the liquid is a polymer dope for the manufacture of regenerated cellulose fibre or film.
13. A method according to Claim 12, characterised in that the liquid is a solution of cellulose in a tertiary amine N-oxide.
