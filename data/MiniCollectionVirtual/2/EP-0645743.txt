<ABSTRACT>
A vend door assembly for a vending machine (10) from 
which articles are selected from a supply area and then 

deposited into a common vending area of the vending machine 
and which provides a customer access opening through which 

articles can be removed. It includes a delivery 
compartment (30) mounted for pivotal movement between a 

receiving position in which articles are received through 
an opening therein from the article supply area, and an 

article retrieving position in which the opening therein is 
pivoted and aligned with the customer access opening in the 

vending area so that a customer can remove the articles 
from the delivery compartment. It further includes an 

anti-pilferage door (52) which is mounted coaxially with 
the delivery compartment (30) for pivotal movement between 

a first position in which it allows articles to be 
deposited in the delivery compartment and a second position 

in which it blocks access to the supply of articles through 
the customer access opening in the vending machine and the 

opening in the delivery compartment, when the delivery 
compartment is in its retrieving position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vending 
machines, and more particularly, to a vend door assembly 
for use therein. Vending machines of the general type to which 
the present invention relates generally have a plurality 
of article storage areas from which individual articles 
can be selected and deposited in a common delivery area 
from which they can be removed by a customer. The 
delivery areas take many forms in the prior art, but are 
essentially compartments into which a customer can reach 
to retrieve the selected article. Although the 
compartment can be open, it is common, for example, to 
provide a hinged door or a sliding door which covers the 
opening and must be displaced in order for the customer 
to remove his chosen article. In addition, because of 
the increase in attempts to pilfer such machines, it has 
become necessary to provide some form of anti-pilferage 
device, such as a sheet metal flap which is moved into 
position between the delivery area and the article 
storage area, at least while the access door is open to 
permit the customer to retrieve his article while 
blocking access to the article storage area. Such anti-pilferage 
devices prevent an individual from reaching 
through the delivery compartment up into the article 
storage area with a wire or some other device to attempt 
to dislodge other articles and cause them to drop into 
the delivery area where they can be retrieved. Because of the need for such anti-pilferage 
devices and the need for a door covering the delivery  
 
area, it is necessary that the delivery compartment be 
formed deeper than would otherwise be necessary, in order to 
allow the door to be swung open above articles deposited 
therein without engaging them. Because of the current 
desire to vend larger products, the use of such prior art 
arrangements has become a limitation on the size of articles 
which may be dispensed from the vending machines because of 
the limited space for expanding the depth of the delivery 
compartment in the lower portion of the machine while 
expanding the customer access opening sufficiently to allow 
retrieval of larger articles. In addition, due to the complexity of the door 
operating mechanisms and anti-pilferage flap operating 
mechanisms, they have become an undesirably expensive and 
complicated portion of the vending machine. US-A-3,957,173 discloses a currency dispensing 
machine from which currency is selected from a supply and 
then deposited in a common access area of the machine 
providing a customer

<CLAIMS>
A vending machine (10) from which articles are 
selected from a supply and then deposited in a common 

vending area of the vending machine, providing a customer 
access opening, through which the article can be removed by 

a customer and including a vend door assembly, said assembly 
comprising:- 


a delivery compartment (30) having an opening 
(32,34) therein and mountable in the vending area for 

pivotal movement between an article receiving position in 
which articles are received through the opening therein from 

the supply of articles and in which it covers the customer 
access opening in the vending area of the vending machine so 

as to block access to the compartment by a customer when in 
this position, and an article retrieving position in which 

the opening therein is aligned with the customer access 
opening in the vending area of the vending machine so that 

an article in the compartment may be removed by a customer; 
an anti-pilferage door (52) mountable coaxially 
with the delivery compartment (30) for pivotal movement 

between a first position in which it provides an opening 
aligned with the opening in the delivery compartment so as 

to allow articles to be deposited in the delivery 
compartment from the article supply when the delivery 

compartment is in its article receiving position, and a 
second position in which it blocks access to the supply of 

articles through the customer access opening in the vending 
machine and the opening in the delivery compartment when the 

delivery compartment is in its retrieving position; and 
means (68,70,72,94-118) for pivoting the delivery 
compartment between its receiving and retrieving positions 

and for pivoting the anti-pilferage door between its first 
and second positions, characterised in that the means 

(68,70,72,94-118) for pivoting the delivery compartment (30)  
 

and anti-pilferage door (52) is adapted to pivot them 
simultaneously. 
A vending machine according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the articles are delivered from the 

article supply to the delivery compartment through a trough 
(26) formed in the vending machine and the anti-pilferage 

door (52) covers the trough when in its second position; and 
in that the anti-pilferage door (52) is disposed adjacent to 

the opening in the vending area and within the delivery 
compartment (30) when the delivery compartment is disposed 

in its receiving position. 
A vending machine according to claim 1 or 2,
