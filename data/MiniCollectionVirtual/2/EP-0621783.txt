<DESCRIPTION>
Pharmaceutical formul ati ons compri si ng a cl avul anic acid sal t and erithromyci n deri ati te.This invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations, in particular to novel uses of formulations in connection with the treatment of infection by 5 intracellular pathogens, in particular microorganisms of the genus Legionella. particularly L. pneumophila.Intracellular pathogens include microorganisms of the genus Legionella. Chlamvdia (e.g. C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae) and Mvcobacterium10 (e.g M.avium. M. fortuitum and M.tuberculosis). Legionella spp. are known to infect the respiratory tract of humans and animals, causing acute and sometimes fatal symptoms. It is known to treat Legionella infection with antibiotics, for example erythromycin. It is an object of this invention to provide alternative and improved pharmaceutical treatments15 for Legionella infection.The invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of clavulanic acid, in combination with erythromycin or a derivative thereof, and optionally one or more other 20 antimicrobial agents.The formulation of the invention is suitable for use in the treatment of infection by intracellular pathogens, e.g. microorganisms of the genus Legionella. in humans or animals.25The present invention also provides a method of use of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of clavulanic acid and erythromycin or a derivative thereof, and optionally one or more other antimicrobial agents, together in combination in the manufacture of a medicament formulation,30 particularly a formulation for the treatment of infection of humans or animals by intracellular pathogens such as microorganisms of the genus Legionella.The present invention further provides a method for the preparation of a 35 pharmaceutical formulation as defined above, which method comprises admixing the combination of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of clavulanic acid, and erythromycin or a derivative thereof and optionally one or more other antimicrobial agents. 

As salts of clavulanic acid are extremely hygroscopic such formulations must be prepared in dry conditions, typically at a relative humidity of 30% or less. All constituents of the formulation should be predried.The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical formulation as defined above for use as an active therapeutic substance, particularly in the treatment of infection of humans or animals by intracellular pathogens, such as microorganisms of the genus Legionella.Further the
