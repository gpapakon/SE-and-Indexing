<ABSTRACT>
Shelves, a shelving or partitioning system are designed so that the individual modular units may be rigidly interconnected both when they are stacked and when they are assembled next to each other. For that purpose, the U-shaped modular units (1) have pocket holes (7) at least approximately centered with respect to the narrow sides (6) of the bearing elements (5). The stacked modular units (1) may be interconnected by linking elements (12) insertable into the pocket holes (7).

<CLAIMS>
Shelves, shelving or partitioning system which 
consists of a number of equal or similar module units (1) 

which may be arranged one above the other and/or in a row 
side by side and are connected detachably together by 

connector elements (12, 18), each module unit (1) being 
constructed as a U-shaped frame part of which the baseplate 

(2) exhibits at each end a bearer-arm (5) set perpendicular 
to the baseplate (2) and exhibiting in its narrow face (6) 

at its free end recesses which correspond with recesses in a 
module unit (1) next to it vertically and in which connector 

elements (12, 18) may be inserted by which module units (1) 
capable of being stacked one above the other are connected 

detachably together and located in position, characterized 
by the following features: 


each recess in the narrow faces (6) at the free ends 
is made as a blind hole (7) which extends 

perpendicularly to the baseplate (2); 
the blind holes (7) are placed centrally or at least 
approximately centrally in the narrow face (6) of 

the bearer-arm (5); 
in prolongation of the centrelines (8) of the blind 
holes (7) present in the narrow faces (6) at the 

free ends of the bearer-arms (5) further blind holes 
(7) are in each case provided in the face (11) of 

the bearer-arm (5) lying opposite the narrow face 
(6) at the respective free end; 
those module units (1) which are to be arranged one 
above the other are connected detachably together 

by connector elements (12) in the form of rods which  
 

are inserted in the blind holes (7) and exhibit in 
the middle region a spacer-collar (15) the outer 

diameter or width (16) of which is equal to or less 
than the wall thickness (17) of the bearer-arms (5); 
those module units (1) which may be arranged in a 
row side by side are connected detachably together 

by H-shaped connector elements (18); 
the arms (19) of the H-shaped connector elements 
(18) exhibit in the middle region spacer-collars 

(15) which are moulded or pushed on and connected 
rigidly together by a spacer-strut (20).

the ratio of 1:1,5 to 1:3. 
Shelves, shelving or partitioning system as in Claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that module units (1) are provided,

(20) in each case, that is, the total length (L+A), 
are in the ratio of 1:1,5 to 1:3.
