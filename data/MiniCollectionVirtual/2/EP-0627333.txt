<ABSTRACT>
This seal comprises an element (1) for fastening onto a projecting part (2) of the frame (3) of a door and two tubular elements (6, 8) made of an elastically deformable material, one (6) of which is contiguous with the second tubular element (8) and with the fastening element (1), these tubular elements (6, 8) being intended to be interposed between the door frame (3) and the associated door (7) when the latter is closed, to provide sealing of the assembly. According to the invention, the tubular elements (6, 8) communicate with one another via at least one orifice (9) or via a continuous passage, so that compressing one of the tubular elements (6) between the door and the door frame results in its deformation and in an inflation of the second tubular element (8) between this same door and the door frame.

<CLAIMS>
A seal for a motor vehicle door (7) comprising an element (1) 
for fixing on a projecting part (2) of the frame (3) of said door and 

tubular elements (6, 8) of an elastically deformable material, the 
tubular elements (6, 8) being intended to be interposed between the door 

frame (3) and the associated door (7) in the closure position thereof to 
ensure sealing of the assembly, the door seal being characterised in 

that it comprises two tubular elements (6, 8) of which the first is 
adjoining the second tubular element (8) and the fixing element (1), 

that said tubular elements (6, 8) communicate with each other by way of 
at least one orifice (9) or by way of a continuous passage so that 

compression of the first tubular element (6) between the door and the 
door frame results in deformation thereof and swelling of the second 

tubular element (8) between said same door and the door frame, and that 

the first tubular element (6) is so disposed as to be compressed by 
the edge of the door (7) while the second tubular element (8) is so 

disposed as to be interposed between the inside face of the door (7) and 
the door frame (3). 
A seal according to claim 1 characterised in that the second 
tubular element (8) is of dimensions such that it is not directly acted 

upon by the door (1) when the door is closed and it comes into contact 
with said door (7) only when it expands under the pressure of the air 

expelled from the first tubular element (6) when the latter is 
compressed.
