<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is an apparatus for guiding 
the edge of a free-falling curtain. The apparatus 

includes first and second slides positioned at the top 
of the curtain which merge. An edge guide (62) is 

positioned at the point where the slides merge. A 
lubricating liquid is provided to each slide surface 

which flows down each slide and the edge guide (62) to guide 
the edge of the free-falling curtain. The present 

invention allows time for surfactant in the lubricating 
liquid time to diffuse to the surface and promotes 

dampening of disturbances in the lubricating liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for coating objects or moving supports
advancing continuously through a coating station with a
free-falling curtain of coating liquid. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a
curtain coating method and apparatus for the
manufacture of photographic film and paper.In a coating apparatus of the curtain coating
type, a moving support is coated by causing a free
falling curtain of coating liquid, referred to
hereafter as simply the curtain, to impinge on a moving
support to form a layer thereon. An apparatus to
perform this method is described in U.S. Patent
3,508,947 to Hughes wherein a multilayer composite of a
plurality of distinct liquids is formed on a slide
hopper and dropped therefrom to form a falling curtain.In the curtain coating process, particularly
as used to manufacture multilayer photographic
materials, the quality of the coating is largely
determined by the properties of the liquid curtain. It
is important to ensure that a stable laminar flow of
coating solution is formed by the slide hopper and that
an equally stable laminar liquid curtain is formed from
that coating solution. To prevent contraction of the
edges of the falling curtain under the effect of
surface tension it is known that the curtain must be
guided at its edges by curtain edge guides.It is well known in the curtain coating art
that introduction of a lubricating liquid between the 
curtain and the edge guide will improve the operation
of the curtain. These improvements include the ability
to maintain the curtain at lower total flow rates with
lubricating liquid than without, and the ability to
maintain curtains of higher viscosity with a
lubricating liquid than without. Typically, the
lubricating liquid is simply water; however, an
alternate liquid of low viscosity may be used for the
same purpose.Surfactants are typically added to the outer
layers of the multiple layer curtain coating
application. As the layers flow down the hopper slide
the surfactant has some time to diffuse from the bulk
of the liquid to the surface and lower the surface
tension of the top layer. When the lubricating liquid
is introduced abruptly its initial surface tension is
unavoidably high compared to the curtain even if there
is surfactant added since there is no time for
surfactant diffusion. This creates a surface-tension-driven
flow which moves some of the high viscosity
curtain solutions to the edge guide. This increases
the effective viscosity near the edge guide and thereby
incr
