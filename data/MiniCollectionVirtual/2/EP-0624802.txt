<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, two unbalanced differential-amplifier stages are supplied by a common signal source delivering an alternating voltage signal, to which source, however, in view of the unbalance, the two differential-amplifier stages are not connected in the same direction. The outputs of the two differential-amplifier stages are, on the other hand, in view of the unbalance, connected in the same direction and are connected to an output circuit forming the load resistances, the output of which circuit delivers the rectified alternating voltage signal which also approximately has a quadratic characteristic.
