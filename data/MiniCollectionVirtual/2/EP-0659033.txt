<ABSTRACT>
A bowlike container has a structure, the whole or part of which includes a single layer of a solid titanium 
alloy, or multiple layers of one or more titanium alloys. The resistivity of the titanium alloy(s) is in a range between 

80x10⁻⁶Ω.cm and 200x10⁻⁶Ω.cm. The container is formed into a desired shape by hot forging or superplastic forming 
of one or more sheets of titanium alloy at 500°C or above. After a long time of use, the container hardly gets fatigued 

and keeps its excellent effect while enduring sufficiently for may years. Accordingly, practical effects are extremely 
great.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a heating container for an electromagnetic
cooking device, in particular, relates to making an
electromagnetic cooking device container, comprising
titanium alloy, by hot forming or superplastic forming.Recently, electromagnetic cooking devices using
electromagnetic induction as an energy source have been
widely utilized for both business and home appliances
instead of gas cooking stoves. A heating principle of such
an electromagnetic cooling device is such that an induction
coil is provided underneath a plate on which cooking
containers such as pans, pots, and cooking skillets are
placed, an alternating magnetic field generated by such
induction coil produces eddy current in the cooking
container, then the eddy current flow in the container
results in generating heat depending on a specific
impedance of material constituting the cooking container.As described above, it has been conventionally
considered that generation of the eddy current in the
cooking container by means of the alternating magnetic
field requires a magnetic material such as stainless steel,
steel or the like (see, Nikkei New Materials, dated March
18, 1991, p.20) for that material of the container.Therefore, the containers for electromagnetic cooking
devices such as pans, pots, and cooking skillets have
generally been made of iron, or made of clad metal which is
superposed with two or more different kinds of metals, for
example, stainless steel and aluminum alloy etc.However in the container made of materials as in the
above, the inventors of the present invention has found
problems in that, where iron is used, the repeated heating
and cooling in the extremely strong magnetic field
disadvantageously provides deformation in the container due
to produced magnetostriction, and in addition, tends to
cause rust, and is more weighty.In a container made of clad metal, repeated heating
and cooking through use produces different thermal 
expansion and magnetostriction between the different kinds
of metals which are superposed each other. This results in
more weight in addition to peeling on bonding of those
different kinds of metals.Furthermore, unitary bonding of different kinds of
metal requires higher costs for scrapping process in
addition to a complicated and therefore expensive
manufacturing process.A drawback is that austenite stainless steel arranged
on the inside surface of the container contacts with meat
or vegetable or the like on cooking so this tends to scorch
and stick
