<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to peptide analogs that are
interleukin-1β protease inhibitors. More particularly, the
invention provides α-substituted methyl ketones derived from
aspartic acid and the closed hemi-ketal forms thereof as
inhibitors of interleukin 1-β protease.Enzymes involved in the catalytic degradation of proteins
by hydrolyzing peptide bonds are known as proteases or
proteinases. Proteinases are believed to be involved in various
disease states including inflammation, metastasis, tissue
damage, bone resorption and muscle degeneration in dystrophic
diseases. Proteinases are divided into classes according to their
catalytic mechanisms, such as serine-, cystein-, aspartic- and
metallo-proteinases. For each class of proteinases, the
catalytic site of the enzyme lies in the cleft on the surface of
the enzymes in which reside the specificity subsites that bind
amino acid side chains and the polypeptide backbone. In
designing proteinase inhibitors, it is important to optimize the
subsite binding characteristics with appropriate amino acid
substrate analogs.This invention relates to peptide substrates modified with
affinity labels that inhibit interleukin-1β protease (hereinafter
IL-1β protease). These inhibitors are thought to act by
alkylating the cysteine sulfhydryl group (cys 285) within the
catalytic site of IL-1β protease. Affinity labelling has been used
since the 1960's to prepare irreversible peptide-based inhibitors
which act to alkylate the active sites of cysteine proteases. A
variety of affinity labels and amino acid sequences have been
synthesized to improve the binding of these modified peptide
inhibitors to the enzyme's active site. These affinity labels
include peptidyl halomethyl ketones, peptidyl diazomethyl 
ketones, epoxysuccinyl peptides and peptidyl methylsulphonium
salts as reviewed by D. Rich in Chapter 4 of "Proteinase
Inhibitors", Barret, A.J. and Salvesen, G., eds., Elsevier, 1986.
More recently, peptide acyloxymethyl and aryloxymethyl ketones
have also been described as affinity lables (Krantz, A. et al.,
Biochemisty, 30, p. 4678-4687, 1991). Current research (see for
example European Patent Application, Pub. No. 01 5,748 A2;
PCT International Publication No. WO 91/15577; Chapman, K.T.,
Biorganic & Medicinal Chem. Lett. 1992, 2, 613-618) has been
directed towards understanding the enzyme binding specificity
requirements in designing novel small molecular weight protease
inhibitors that are efficacious, safe and have specificity for
IL-1β protease which is believed to play
