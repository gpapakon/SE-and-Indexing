<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
accelerating the rate of production of oximes from 
aldehydes or ketones and hydroxylamine. Oximes are important organic derivatives of 
hydroxylamine. The compounds are amphoteric and have 
many uses. For example, the use of 2-hydroxyarylaldoximes 
(salicylaldoximes) as extractants in the 
hydrometallurgical recovery of metals from metal ores is 
well known and has been practiced commercially for a 
number of years. More specifically, the compound 
5-nonylsalicylaldehyde oxime is used in the mining 
industry for the hydrometallurgical recovery of copper 
from crude ores. Oximes are prepared by the direct reaction of 
hydroxylamine with aldehydes and ketones. However, long 
cycle times are required to achieve high yields. 
Exemplary of the present state of the art is the 
oximation reaction of 5-nonylsalicylaldehyde which is 
carried out at 45°C by the addition of sodium carbonate 
to a two-phase system consisting of a toluene solution 
of aldehyde and an aqueous solution of hydroxylamine 
sulfate. Using a feed stock of 90% aldehyde strength, 
cycle times of approximately 8 hours are required to 
convert greater than 98% of the aldehyde to the oxime. 
The long cycle times required to obtain high yields 
significantly slow the overall manufacturing process. 
Thus, it is desirable to reduce the cycle time of the 
oximation process.  
 Attempts have been made to improve the yields 
and increase the rate of oximation reactions. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,133,834 discloses the use of soluble iron 
compounds to accelerate the formation of alpha- and 
beta-hydroxy oximes from the corresponding carbonyl 
compounds. Catalytic amounts of ferrous (Fe2+) and 
ferric (Fe3+) contributing compounds are used. However, 
relatively high levels of catalyst are required and the 
iron compounds impart an objectionable color to the 
oxime product. Another process for producing oximes is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,808,275 in which a 
variety of inorganic tin-containing compounds were used 
to improve the yield of oximations. The tin-containing 
compounds disclosed also include organotin compounds 
such as trialkyl tin, but no examples are given. 
Exemplary of the inorganic tin compounds is the use of 
0.1 g of sodium α-stannate (Na2SnO3·3H2O) in the 
oximation of 91 g of cyclododecanone to cyclododecanoneoxime. 
The conversion of cyclododecanone 
increased to 98.1% as opposed to 94.6% in the absence of 
sodium α-stannate. Yields of the oxime were increased 
from 98.3% to 99.2%.
