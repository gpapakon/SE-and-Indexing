<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device are disclosed, during which a quantitatively proportional analysis sample of less than 50 ml can be taken from a milk flow, even in the case of cows having an expected total milk quantity of up to 30 kg and expected maximum milk flows of 12 kg per minute. The method is in this case distinguished in that, by using a cyclically controlled valve, each cycle comprising a valve open time and a valve closed time, for taking only analysis samples kept below a predetermined maximum quantity of 50 ml, from the empirically determined expected value of the total milk quantity to be milked from the cow in question, a cycle time and a valve open time are determined, the cycle time and the valve open time being in each case selected such that they lie within predetermined value ranges, such that the valve open time or the cycle time are controlled as a function of the milk flow, and such that, in order to avoid values of the valve open time or of the cycle time lying outside the value ranges, as a result of change in the milk flow, the valve open time and the cycle time are changed in the same ratios with respect to the values lying within the value ranges. The device, by means of which such a milk sample collection can be carried out, comprises a milk flow meter, a processor unit and a milk-sampling device which essentially comprises an electrically controllable solenoid, using which a closure member can be moved into a first position which blocks a flow orifice for the sampling flow and a second position which uncovers this orifice.
