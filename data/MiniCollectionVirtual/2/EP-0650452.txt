<ABSTRACT>
Valve assembly (1) for a pressurised aerosol container which has a neutral bias. The valve may be of the metered dose type and is preferably springless. The containers equipped with such valves may be employed in breath actuated dispensing devices with simplified mechanisms since it is not necessary to overcome any biasing force within the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to valve assemblies for 
pressurised aerosol containers according to the preamble of claim 1 
and in particular to valve assemblies capable of 
dispensing metered-doses of the contents of an aerosol 
container. Pressurised fluid containers are in widespread use 
for dispensing a wide variety of materials including 
cosmetic materials, e.g., deodorants, body fresheners 
etc., and domestic cleaning materials, e.g., detergents, 
polishes, waxes etc. Conventional pressurised fluid 
containers are provided with a valve assembly for 
dispensing the container contents comprising a hollow, 
elongate valve member which is movable relative to the 
body of the container between an outer closed position and 
an inner dispensing position. The valve member is biased, 
usually by a spring, to the outer closed position to 
prevent the discharge of material from the container when 
not in use. To actuate the valve assembly, the valve 
member is depressed inwardly by the user to the dispensing 
position allowing material to exit from the container. The use of aerosol devices to administer medicament, 
such as drugs or other therapeutically active compounds, 
by inhalation therapy is commonplace, particularly for the 
treatment of respiratory disorders, such as asthma, where 
it is important that the amount of material dispensed is a 
predetermined, accurate volume each time the valve is 
actuated. The aerosol container is charged with a self-propelling 
liquid composition containing the medicament 
dissolved or dispersed therein and provided with a valve 
assembly capable of dispensing metered amounts of the 
composition. Examples of such valve assemblies are 
disclosed in British Patent Nos. 864694 (which describes a valve 
assembly according to the preamble of claim 1), 1287126, 1336379, 
2004526, 2077229 and 2086845, European Patent No. 191614 
and U.S. Patent Specification Nos. 2,746,796 and 
3,738,542.  
 Many known metering valve assemblies for pressurised 
aerosol containers comprise a metering chamber positioned 
at the outlet of the container which is filled with a 
fresh dose of the material to be dispensed immediately 
after the previous dose has been dispensed. This feature 
is incorporated into the valve assembly to avoid the need 
to prime the assembly before use. A hollow elongate valve 
member is arranged for reciprocal movement through the 
metering chamber between a closed, non-dispensing position 
where the metering chamber is filled with the material to 
be dispensed and a

<CLAIMS>
A valve assembly (1) for a pressurised aerosol 
container comprising: 


a casing (3) adapted to be secured to an aerosol 
container; 
a hollow body (5) secured to the casing (3) and 
defining a metering chamber (7) having a first opening (2) 

communicating with the outside environment and a second 
opening (4) communicating with the interior of the aerosol 

container; and 
an elongate valve member (9) sealingly extending 
through an aperture (11) in the casing and at least the 

first opening (2) of the metering chamber, which elongate 

valve member (9) is reciprocally movable between a 
dispensing position in which there is an open channel (23) 

through the elongate valve (9) member connecting the 
metering chamber (7) with the outside environment and the 

metering chamber is sealed to prevent the passage of 
material from the interior of the aerosol container to the 

metering chamber (7) and a closed, non-dispensing position 
in which the elongate valve member (9) allows the passage 

of material from the interior of the aerosol container to 
the metering chamber (7) but prevents the passage of 

material from the metering chamber to the outside 
environment, 
 
   characterised in that the elongate valve member 

has no net mechanical bias to the dispensing or non-dispensing 
positions. 
A valve assembly as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the casing (3) is adapted to be secured to an aerosol 

container defining a formulation chamber, the hollow body 
(5) defining a metering chamber having a first opening (2) 

communicating with the outside environment and a second 
opening (4) communicating with the formulation chamber, 

and wherein the elongate valve member (9) comprises an 
outlet channel (23) communicating with the outside  

 
environment and an inlet channel (27), which valve member 

is unbiased and reciprocally moveable between: 

(i) a dispensing position, in which the outlet 
channel (23) also communicates with the metering chamber, 

and in which the valve member is in sealing engagement 
with the second opening of the metering chamber to prevent 

the passage of formulation from the formulation chamber to 
the metering chamber (7), and 
(ii) a closed, non-dispensing position, in 
which the inlet channel of the valve member is in open 

communication with the formulation chamber and the 
metering chamber (7), thereby allowing the passage of 

formulation from the formulation chamber to the metering 
chamber (7), and in which the valve member is in sealing 

engagement with the first opening (2) in the metering 
chamber, thereby preventing the passage of formulation 

from the metering chamber to the outside environment. 
A valve assembly for a pressurised aerosol 
container as claimed in Claim 2 in which the elongate 

valve member (9) comprises a discharge orifice (21) 
through which material can be dispensed from the valve 

assembly, an outlet passage (23) through which material 
can pass to the discharge orifice (21) and a transfer port 

(25) through which material can pass from the metering 
chamber to the outlet passage (23), the elongate valve 

member being arranged such that in the non-dispensing 
position material cannot pass through the transfer port 

(25) from the metering chamber (7). 
A valve assembly for a pressurised aerosol 
container as claimed in any preceding Claims in which the 

elongate valve member comprises a filling channel (27) 
disposed on the outer surface thereof along which material 

can pass from the interior of the aerosol container to the 
metering chamber, the elongate valve member being arranged 

such that in the dispensing position material cannot pass
