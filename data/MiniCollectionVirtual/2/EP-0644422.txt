<ABSTRACT>
A yarn package transport system with which sampling of a yarn 
from a yarn package and test knitting are performed 

automatically is provided. 
The yarn package transport system includes a sampling station 

(S2) provided for a transport line (1) along which packages 
(P) are successively transported for sampling a yarn of a 

predetermined length from each package (P). A test knitting 
machine (16) is connected to the sampling station (S2) and a 

yarn splicing apparatus (15) for splicing yarns to be tested 
is provided in the sampling station (S2). When a yarn is 

spliced, the yarn tail (34) produced at one end of the splice 
joint (32) is arranged to be longer than the yarn tail (33) at the 

opposite end of the splice joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a yarn package transport system acc. to the preamble of
claim 1.Automatically operating sampling stations for a yarn package transport system are
known from US-A-4 116 393, CA-A-851 412, CA-A-934 946.On the transport line, inspections for the appearance,
cob-webbing, fluff and so forth are performed while packages
are transported on a conveyor in a condition in which
they are carried on peg trays. Where a sampling station
for drawing out a yarn from each package and successively
splicing the yarns is provided for the transport line
and a test knitting machine is connected to the sampling
station, sampling of a yarn of a predetermined amount
is automatically performed and test knitting by the test
knitting machine is performed subsequently to yarn splicing.
Since a standard package and a color package are installed
at the sampling station such that they can be changed
over, a standard fabric for comparison or a color fabric
for distinction can be automatically knit in intermediately
of test knitting of packages.In particular, when a yarn package is automatically
doffed by an automatic doffer, each time a component
for a doffing operation touches with a yarn, an end of
the yarn is sometimes damaged. If such a damaged yarn
end is sampled and inspected by test knitting or the
like, the yarn cannot be evaluated accurately. Further, on a drawing false twisting machine, oil is
usually applied by an oiling apparatus to a yarn before
it is rewound. However, since a yarn being wound is
cut upon doffing with an automatic doffer and an end
of the yarn is sucked in while doffing is performed,
if the sucking force is weak, then there is the possibility
that the yarn may be entangled with the oiling apparatus,
and accordingly, cutting and sucking are performed after
the yarn is removed from the oiling apparatus. Accordingly,
since a first portion of a yarn on a surface layer is
a yarn which has not been oiled, there is the possibility
that the quality may not be evaluated accurately by test
knitting or the like.The problem underlying the invention is to provide a yarn package transport system
by means of which error-free yarn sampling for quality inspections may be
performed.In accordance with the invention this object is accomplished by a surface layer yarn
releasing station as defined in the characterizing part of claim 1.The invention is based on the fact that irregular yarn which has been damaged
upon doffing by an automatic doffer or to which oil is not applied is only present in
the

A yarn package transport system, including a sampling station (S2; S102)
provided for a transport line (1; 101)along which yarn packages (P) are

successively transported, for sampling a yarn of a predetermined length from each
package (P),
characterized by

a surface layer yarn releasing station (S1; S101) for releasing and removing a
surface layer yarn of the packages (P) which is provided forwardly of that sampling

station (S2; S102).
A yarn package transport system according to claim 1, wherein a yarn splicing
apparatus (15; 119) for successively splicing said sampled yarns is provided in said

sampling station (S2; S102).
A yarn package transport system acc. to claim 2, wherein a test knitting
machine (16; 126) for knitting yarns spliced by said splicing apparatus (15; 119) is

connected to said sampling station (S2; S102).
A yarn package transport system acc. to claim 2, wherein the splicing
apparatus (15; 119) includes means for arranging a tail of spliced yarns to be long

enough so that the spliced joint can be easily and visually found after splicing
operation. 
A yarn package transport system acc. to claim 4, wherein the yarn tail
produced at one end of the splice joint is arranged to be longer than the yarn tail at

the opposite end of the splice joint.
A yarn package transport system acc. to claim 5, wherein the tail on the
downstream side with respect to the advancing direction of the yarn in which the

yarn is fed for testing after yarn splicing is arranged to be longer than another tail
on the upstream side.
A yarn package transport system acc. to claim 3, wherein a standard package
(SP) on which a standard yarn for comparison is wound and/or a color package

(CP) on which a color yarn for distinction is wound are provided at said sampling
station (S2) such that a standard yarn and/or a color yarn can be changed over

between the standard yarn or a color yarn and said sampled yarn.
A yarn package transport system acc. to claim 1, wherein a test machine for
evaluating each yarn sampled from each package (P) is connectd in said sampling

station (S2).
A yarn package transport system acc. to claim 1, wherein the surface layer
yarn releasing station (S1, S102) includes first suction means (suction mouth 13;

suction mouth 113) for sucking in an end of a yarn of a surface layer of a package
(P), means for lifting the thus sucked yarn toward a longitudinal direction of the

package (P), second suction means (pivotal sucker 14; suction pipe 116) for
sucking-in the thus lifted yarn to release the yarn of the suface layer of the package

(P'), and yarn putting aside means (levers 64, 68; lever 118) for introducing the thus
released yarn into a yarn splicing apparatus (15, 119) located at the sampling

station.
