<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a combined cold-air machine cooling and heating process for air-conditioning a space and a device for carrying out the process, in particular for use in driver's cabs of locomotives and similar spaces. The process according to the invention is a combined cold-air machine cooling and heating process which operates in the partial vacuum range in order to air-condition a space, in particular driver's cabs of locomotives or the like, according to which either cooling or heating can be carried out. If the intention is no longer to cool the space but rather to heat it, according to the invention four valves are switched over and the heat exchange which is required for the secondary circuit of the cooling system has the outlet air of the cab flowing through it and operates as a regenerator for the heating process.
