<ABSTRACT>
A method for assembling an optical isolator 
comprises a step for constructing a measuring system 

in which a light source (7), a lens system (6), a 
polarizer (2), an analyzer (4), and a light receiver 

(5) are arranged in this order, and light (10) 
projected from the light source (7) and then 

transmitted through the lens system (6), the 
polarizer (2), and the analyzer (4), is received by 

the light receiver (5); a step for arranging optical 
elements for constituting a main body of the optical 

isolator (1) between the polarizer (2) and the 
analyzer (4); a step for measuring a maximum value 

and a minimum value in levels of the light received 
by the light receiver (5) while the analyzer (4) is 

rotated, thereby calculating a ratio of the minimum 
value to the maximum value; and a step for adjusting 

rotation positions of the respective components for 
constituting the main body of the optical isolator 

(1) in order that the ratio becomes minimal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
assembling an optical isolator in such a way that it 
facilitates easily checking isolation at an assembly 
stage of a main body of an optical isolator which 
can be used in an optical fiber communication and so 
on, and to a method for measuring isolation of the 
optical isolator. Fig. 1 schematically shows an arrangement of one 
example of a typical optical isolator main body. As 
illustrated in Fig. 1, the main body 1 of the 
optical isolator is constructed of a birefringence 
crystal plate 11, a half-wave plate 12, a magneto-optic 
crystal plate having the Farady effect (Farady 
rotator) 13, another birefringence crystal plate 14, 
and a magnet 15. The birefringence crystal plate 
11, the half-wave plate 12, the Farady rotator 13, 
and the birefringence crystal plate 14 are 
sequentially arranged in this sequence is the 
direction, whereas the magnet 15 is arranged in such 
a manner that the Farady rotator 13 is magnetized.  It should be noted that the birefringence 
crystal plate 11 is positioned in such a manner that 
the crystal optic axis thereof is inclined with 
respect to the propagation direction, and light 
incident upon this birefringence crystal plate 11 is 
separated into two types of rays whose planes of 
vibration are located perpendicular to each other 
(namely, ordinary ray and extraordinary ray). 
Within the birefringence crystal plate 11, the 
ordinary ray is advanced along a straight line, 
whereas the extraordinary ray is traveled along an 
inclined line. However, after these rays emanate 
from the crystal plate 11, they are traveled as 
mutually parallel rays along the propagation 
direction. The half-wave plate 12 owns a crystal 
axis along such a direction that is inclined by 67.5 
degrees along the counterclockwise direction (as 
viewed from the left direction in Fig. 1) from a 
direction defined when the optic axis of the 
birefringence crystal plate 11 is projected onto its 
surface (hereinafter referred to as the projected 
direction). Therefore, the vibration planes of the rays 
incident on the half-wave plate 12 are inclined 
around the propagation direction with respect to the 
crystal axis by 67.5 degrees and -22.5 degrees, 
respectively. The rays passed through this half-wave 
plate 12 are rotated by double the angle of 
67.5 degrees and -22.5 degrees, respectively (the 
extraordinary ray is rotated by 135 degrees along 
the counterclockwise direction and the ordinary ray 
is rotated by 45 degrees along the clockwise 
dire
