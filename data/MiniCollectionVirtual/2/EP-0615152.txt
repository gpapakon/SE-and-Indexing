<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to methods for the production of materials having good non-linear optical properties which can be structured, as well as the use of these materials. The method is characterised in that materials having a liquid-crystalline matrix are exposed, below their glass transition temperature, simultaneously to an electric field and unpolarised and/or circularly polarised light. Cyclic polysiloxanes are used as materials having a liquid-crystal matrix. The method enables the production of structured samples having good non-linear optical properties.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of a material having 
large, stable, reversible susceptibility, in which a 

material having a liquid-crystalline matrix and a glass 
transition temperature above room temperature and containing 

at least one chromophoric group which can be 
excited by suitable light and enables, through 

photophysical processes, realignment of the liquid-crystalline 
matrix to give a homeotropic structure, and 

containing at least one chromophoric group of high 
molecolar hyperpolarizability is subjected, at below its 

glass transition temperature, simultaneously to an 
electric field and unpolarized and/or circular-polarized 

light. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the materials having a liquid-crystalline matrix are 

cyclic polysiloxanes. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the materials having a liquid-crystalline matrix are 

cyclic polysiloxanes having cholesteric properties. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the materials having a liquid-crystalline 

matrix are cyclic polysiloxanes containing 4-amino-4′-nitroazobenzene 
or 4-amino-4′-cyanoazobenzene as 

nonlinear-optical groups.
