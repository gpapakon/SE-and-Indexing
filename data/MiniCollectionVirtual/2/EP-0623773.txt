<ABSTRACT>
A control valve comprises a valve body (A) having a fluid 
channel (6) and a valve seat (8); a valve operating part (B); a valve 

stem supporting member (3) having its upper end fixed to the 
valve operating part and its lower end fixed to the valve 

body; a valve stem (4) penetrating the valve stem supporting 
member and having its upper end part connected to the valve 

operating part and its lower end part entering the valve 
body, the valve stem being movable upward or downward by 

the valve operating part; and a valve element (5) attached to 
the lower end of the valve stem. The valve element is 

moved upward or downward by moving the valve stem upward or 
downward, the valve element being brought into contact with 

and seated in the valve seat to close a fluid channel as it 
is moved downward, t
he valve element being detached from 
the valve seat to open the fluid channel as it is moved 

upward. The valve stem comprises an upper bar-shaped 
member (20) of metal connected to the valve operating member and 

a lower bar-shaped member (21) made of a fiber reinforced 
plastic to which the valve element is attached. The upper 

and lower bar-shaped members are movable upward from a 
lower end position where the valve element is in a fully 

open state. The lower bar-shaped member is stop from 
moving upward at an upper end position where the valve 

element is in a fully open state. An uppward moving 
distance of the upper bar-shaped member from a lower end 

position is made longer than a moving distance of the lower 
bar-shaped member from the lower end position to the upper 

end position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control valve. The terms "upward" and "downward" and like terms as 
used herein and in the appended claims are merely intended 
to express the position relation between the components of 
the control valve as arranged in the drawings showing the 
embodiment to be described below. These terms should not 
be interpreted as expressing the absolute "up-down" 
relation in the state in which the control valve is used. The control valve comprises a valve body having a 
fluid channel and a valve seat; a valve operating part; a 
valve stem supporting member having its upper end fixed to 
the valve operating part and its lower end fixed to the 
valve body respectively; a valve stem penetrating the valve 
stem supporting member and having its upper end part 
connected to the valve operating part and its lower end 
part entering the valve body, the valve stem being movable 
upwardly or downwardly by means of the valve operating 
part; and a valve element attached to the lower end of the 
valve stem. The valve element is moved upward or downward 
by moving the valve stem upward or downward. The valve 
element is brought into contact with and seated in the 
valve seat to close the fluid channel as it is moved  
 
downward. The valve element is detached from the valve 
seat to open the fluid channel as it is moved upward. Conventionally, this type of control valve has the 
valve stem integrally formed by metal. However, in the conventional control valve having the 
entire valve stem integrally formed by metal, when a fluid 
in a low temperature or in a high temperature flows through 
the fluid channel of the valve body, heat inflows or 
outflows through the valve stem between the valve operating 
part and the fluid, and consequently entailing a problem 
wherein the fluid alters its temperature. The object of the present invention is to solve the 
above mentioned problem and to provide a control valve 
wherein heat does not inflow or outflow through the valve 
stem between the valve operating part and the fluid. The control valve of the present invention comprises 
a valve body having a fluid channel and a valve seat; a 
valve operating part; a valve stem supporting member having 
its upper end fixed to the valve operating part and its 
lower end fixed to the valve body respectively; a valve 
stem penetrating the valve stem supporting member and 
having its upper end part connected to the valve operating 
part and its lower end part entering the valve body, the  
 
valve stem being
