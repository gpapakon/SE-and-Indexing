<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR REDUCING DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY IN OPTICAL-QUALITY CRYSTALS FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a-process for reducing the .damage susceptibility of optically useful crystals of KTiOP04 and certain of its analogs.EACKGRQUNP The need for optical-quality single crystals of materials exhibiting nonlinear optical properties is well established in the art. Potassium titanyl phosphate (i.e., KTP) is particularly useful in nonlinear optical devices, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,949,323. For many optical applications (e.g., second harmonic and other frequency generation and electro-optic applications) optical- quality crystals having dimensions on the order of one millimeter or more are generally desired. Since KTiOP04 and its analogs are known to decompose upon melting, hydrothermal or flux methods have commonly been used to grow crystals of these compounds. U.S. Patent No. 4,231,838 discloses a method of crystal growth from a nonaqueous flux. U.S. Patent No. 3,949,323 discloses the preparation of crystals of compounds such as potassium titanyl phosphate by hydrothermal methods. Hydrothermal methods of crystal growth are considered particularly advantageous methods of crystal growth for certain applications since they often produce crystals of relatively low damage susceptibility. In part due to the popularity of the hydrothermal process, many improvements have been made in the basic process over the years. 

 U.S. Patent No. 4,305,778 discloses a high temperature hydrothermal process for crystal growth of a group of materials including potassium titanyl phosphate which utilizes a mineralizer solution comprising at least in part a stable glass composition that minimizes the tendency of the seed crystals to dissolve in the aqueous mineralizer solution before nutrient can migrate to'the seed crystals. More recently, U.S. Patent 5,066,356 discloses an improved low temperature hydrothermal process using mineralizers relatively high in potassium which produces potassium titanyl phosphate crystals at relatively low pressures, as well as low temperatures.While the crystals produced by the known hydrothermal processes can have high optical quality, the rigors of certain optical applications, require high resistance to optical damage or lower susceptibility to optical damage than exhibited by most hydrothermally produced crystals. For example, in uses where the crystal is subjected to high electric fields or high power laser radiation, a typical hydrothermal crystal can
