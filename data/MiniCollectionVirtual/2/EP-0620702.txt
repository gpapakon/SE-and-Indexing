<ABSTRACT>
The core according to the invention for electrical interconnection substrates, especially for printed circuit boards and flexible printed circuit boards, has an inner layer (I) having a column structure and metallic covering layers (A, A') on both sides, the column structure of the inner layer (I) consisting of columns (9.1, 9.2) which advantageously arranged regularly, are spaced apart from one another and from the covering layers (A, A'), are directed transversely with respect to the planar extent of the core and consist of an electrically conductive material in a matrix (6) made of an electrically insulating material. The covering layers (A, A') have, for example, electrical connections (16, 16', 17, 17') in the form of through-plated blind holes (13, 14) on selected columns (9) of the inner layer (I) and are structured in such a manner that they have a regular pattern of connections (16, 16') to the opposite covering layer and connections (17, 17') to through-connectors which are insulated from (by) the covering layers. This grid pattern may have a grid size of approximately 0.5mm.

c) the coated metal sheet is wet-etched, in such a
manner that approximately half the metal
