<CLAIMS>
ISDN telecommunications branch exchange having a 
unit (HW-CL) which automatically forms time and/or date 

information and having a Common Control (CC) to which a 
control program is allocated and which is designed in 

such a manner that the unit (HW-CL) which forms time 
and/or date information is synchronized to time and/or 

date information supplied by ISDN transmission paths 
(ISDN-AL) which are connected, characterized in that the 

telecommunications branch exchange has a timer (CL-T) 
which is set by time and/or date information supplied by 

the ISDN transmission paths (ISDN-AL) which are 
connected, and which, for a predetermined time period 

after being set, suppresses synchronization of the unit 
(HW-CL) which automatically forms time and/or date 

information. 
ISDN telecommunications branch exchange according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that the prog
ram which is 
allocated to the Common Control (CC) of the telecommunications 

branch exchange is designed in such a manner 
that, when the unit (HW-CL) which forms time and/or date 

information is brought back into use following a failure 
of said unit (HW-CL) which forms time and/or date information, 

said unit is synchronized, before the originally 
predetermined time has elapsed, to time information 

supplied by the transmission paths (ISDN-AL) which are 
connected.
