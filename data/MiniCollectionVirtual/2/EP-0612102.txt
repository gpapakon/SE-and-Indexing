<ABSTRACT>
Method of fabricating semiconductor devices such as thin- 
film transistors by annealing a substantially amorphous silicon 

film at a temperature either lower than normal crystallization 
temperature of amorphous silicon or lower than the glass 

transition point of the substrate so as to crystallize the 
silicon film. Islands, stripes, lines, or dots of nickel, iron, 

cobalt, or platinum, silicide, acetate, or nitrate of nickel, 
iron, cobalt, or platinum, film containing various salts, 

particles, or clusters containing at least one of nickel, iron, 
cobalt, and platinum are used as starting materials for 

crystallization. These materials are formed on or under the 
amorphous silicon film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for obtaining crystalline
semiconductors for use in thin film devices such as thin film
insulator gate type field effect transistors (Thin Film
Transistors, or TFTs).Conventionally, crystalline silicon semiconductor thin films
used in thin film devices such as thin film insulator gate type
field effect transistors (TFTs) have been manufactured by forming
an amorphous silicon film on an insulating surface such as an
insulator substrate by plasma CVD or thermal CVD and then
crystallizing this film in an electric furnace or the like at a
temperature of above 600°C over a long period of twelve hours or
more. In order to obtain particularly good performance (high
field effect mobility and high reliability), heat treatment for
even longer periods has been required.However, there have been numerous problems associated with
this kind of conventional method. One problem has been that
throughput is low and therefore costs are high. For example, if
24 hours are required for this crystallization process, and if
the treatment time for each substrate is 2 minutes, it has been
necessary to treat 720 substrates at the same time. However, for
example, in a commonly used tube furnace the number of substrates
that can be treated at one time is 50 at the most, and when one
only apparatus (reaction tube) is used the time taken per
substrate has been as long as 30 minutes. In other words, in
order to make the treatment time per substrate 2 minutes, it has
been necessary to use as many as 15 reaction tubes. This has
meant that the scale of the required capital investment has been 
great and that the depreciation on that investment has been large
and has kept the cost of the product high.Another problem has been the temperature of the heat
treatment. Substrates commonly used in the manufacture of TFTs
can be generally divided into those which consist of pure silicon
oxide, like quartz glass, and no-alkali borosilicate glass types,
like Corning Co.'s No.7059 (hereinafter referred to as Corning
7059). Of these two classes, in the case of the former, because
they have excellent resistance to heat and can be handled in the
same way that substrates are handled in ordinary semiconductor
integrated circuit wafer processes, there are no problems
relating to heat. However, they are expensive, and their cost
rapidly increases exponentially along with increases in surface
area. Therefore, at present, they are only being used in TFT
integrated circuits of relatively small surface area.No-alkali glass, on
