<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid separation apparatus, 
particularly to a fluid separation apparatus using hollow-fiber membranes 
having a selective permeability to fluid. More particularly, it relates to 
enlargement of a hollow-fiber membrane apparatus in order to adapt it for 
industrial performance. The fluid separation apparatus for separating components of 
fluid by using a membrane having a selective permeability is applied to 
various techniques such as gas permeation, liquid permeation, dialysis, 
ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, or the like. Recently, attention has been 
particularly given to the reverse osmosis which is especially effective for 
desalination and purification of sea water or brackish water, for recovering 
useful or harmful components from waste water or for reuse of water. 
Membrane separation apparatuses are employed for carrying out these 
techniques and are classified into flat membrane type, tubular type, spiral 
type and hollow-fiber type according to the shape and form of the 
semi-permeable membrane used therein. Among these, a hollow-fiber type 
apparatus has very high membrane separation efficiency per unit volume of 
the apparatus because no substrate for the semi-permeable membrane is 
needed. Hollow-fiber membranes are particularly suited for reverse osmosis 
separations. The reverse osmosis is usually carried out by treating a fluid 
under pressure higher than the osmotic pressure of the fluid, by which the 
components of fluid are separated via a membrane having a selective 
permeability. The pressure may vary with the kinds of fluids to be treated, 
the properties of the selectively permeable membranes, or the like, but is 
usually in the range from 0.28 to 14 MPa (40 to 2000 psi) for hollow-fiber membranes. 
Accordingly, it is very important that the membrane, the supporting material 
and the casing vessel used for the reverse osmosis should have a high 
pressure resistance. There is a tendency in the fluid separation industry to enlarge 
an apparatus to be used in the membrane separation techniques in order to  
 
adapt it for industrial performance. Particularly, enlargement of a reverse 
osmosis hollow-fiber apparatus is of great advantage to adapt it for industrial 
performance because the apparatus has high volumetric efficiency. Be 
larger-size apparatus can feed a much larger amount of fluid than that of a 
conventional apparatus. In comparison with a conventional apparatus, a 
large-size fluid separation apparatus has many advantages

<CLAIMS>
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus which 
comprises:
 
a pressure container (22) composed of a shell and end 

plates (24, 26);
 
a plurality of hollow-fiber bundles (20, 21), each comprising 

a cross-section bundle of hollow fibers having one 
end mounted in a tubesheet (28, 30) and a sealed end, which 

are longitudinally aligned with their sealed ends facing 
each other and placed in the pressure container (22), said 

hollow-fibers having selective permeability to fluid, and 
being further aligned so as to form a first space (60, 61) 

between the outside of the bundles and the inside of the 
pressure container;
 
an elongated feed member (36) through which fluid to be 

treated can flow into and radially through each of the 
hollow-fiber bundles;
 
a first opening (51) in the pressure container which is in 

communication with the elongated feed member (36) through 
which the fluid to be treated is fed;
 
a second opening or openings (52, 53) in the pressure 

container in communication with the open ends of the hollow 
fibers through which the permeate is discharged and
 
a third opening (54) in the pressure container for discharging 

the residue fluid
characterized by
  
 

a second space (64) situated in between adjacent hollow-fiber 
bundles, said space being defined by the facing ends 

of adjacent hollow-fiber bundles and being in communication 
with the first space between the outside of the bundles and 

the pressure container and
 
an elongated discharge member (76) housed inside said 

elongated feed member (36), said elongated discharge member 
being in communication with said second space (64) and said 

third opening (54). 
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus of claim 1 in 
which the pressure container (22) is an elongated cylinder. 
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus of claim 2 in 
which the first space (60, 61) is an annular space. 
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus of claim 1 
containing two hollow-fiber bundles (20, 21). 
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus of claim 4, in 
which the two hollow-fiber bundles (20, 21) are substantially 

identical in size and configuration. 
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus of claim 1 in 
which the hollow-fiber membranes in each hollow-fiber 

bundle (20, 21) has an inner diameter of about 20 µm to 
about 200 µm and a hollow ratio of about 10% to about 50%. 
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus of claim 1 in 
which the hollow-fiber membranes have an inner diameter of 

about 40 µm and a hollow ratio of about 20%. 
A hollow-fiber membrane separation apparatus of claim 1 in 
which the elongated discharge member (76) is concentrically 

housed within the elongated feed member (36).  
 
A process for selectively separating fluids comprising a 
hollow-fiber membrane fluid-separation apparatus according 

to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the feed fluid passes 
into the fluid separation apparatus through the first 

opening (51); the feed fluid is simultaneously distributed 
radially to two or more hollow-fiber bundles (20, 21) 

through the elongated feed member (36); the feed fluid 
selectively permeates the hollow-fiber membranes and the 

permeate flows through the hollow-fibers to the tubesheets 
(28, 30) at the end of each bundle (20, 21) and then being 

discharged from the pressure container through the second 
opening (52, 53); the residue fluid flows radially through 

the hollow-fiber bundles (20, 21) and is collected in the 
first space (60, 61) between each hollow-fiber bundle (20, 

21) and the pressure container (22); thereafter, the 
residue fluid from all hollow-fiber bundles (20, 21) flows 

through second space (64) into the elongated discharge member 
(76) and is discharged 

through the third opening (54) in the pressure container.
