<ABSTRACT>
This mobile radio network consists of a multiplicity of radio base stations which by this means supply a multiplicity of radio cells, mobile stations in the mobile radio network being connected to a radio base station allocated to the respective radio cell by means of a radio link, measurements of received parameters being carried out into the mobile station during the existence of the radio link and the measurement values being transmitted to the mobile radio network in the form of messages and, when certain values of the parameters are reached, the radio link is changed from one radio cell to another one, the mobile station receiving additional information which is provided in a source independent of the mobile radio network and influencing the said messages at a particular time in dependence on the content of this information, in such a manner that the mobile radio network can decide a handover to the cell desired by the mobile station on the basis of these messages.

<CLAIMS>
Method for carrying out location-dependent
handover in a mobile radio network which comprises a

plurality of mobile base stations which service a
plurality of radio cells, mobile stations in the mobile

radio network being connected by means of a radio link to
a mobile base station assigned to the respective radio

cell, measurements of reception parameters being carried
out in the mobile station during the radio link and the

measured values being transmitted to the mobile radio
network in the form of messages and the radio link being

changed from one radio cell to another when specific
values of the parameters are reached, characterized in

that the mobile station receives additional information
which is made available in a source which is independent

of the mobile radio network, and a said mobile station
influences the aforesaid messages at a specific time as

a function of the content of this information in such a
way that the mobile radio network can decide, on the

basis of these messages, to form a handover to the radio
cell requested by the mobile station.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the aforesaid additional information to the mobile

station is generated by means of a local-information
generator which is stationed at a defined location in the

radio cell.
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized
in that the mobile station is equipped with its

own database for carrying out the method.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that all the necessary cell numbers of the mobile radio 

network, the prescribed data telegram and the information
elements which are used for manipulating the messages are

stored in the database.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that a controller which is located in the

mobile station can switch the message generator into two
different modes of operation, the normal mode and the

special mode.
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in
that, in the special mode, the message generator manipulates

the measurement report in such a way that only the
desired cell of the mobile station is specified to the

mobile radio network as the single possible target cell
for a handover.
Device for carrying out a location-dependent
handover in a mobile radio network which comprises a

plurality of mobile base stations which service a plurality
of radio cells (4, 5), mobile stations (3) in the

mobile radio network being connected by means of a radio
link to a mobile base station which is assigned to the

respective radio cell (4, 5), characterized in that a
local-information generator (A) is located at a defined

distance from a static and defined cell boundary (B), and
in that the local-information generator (A) transmits

local information to the passing mobile station (3).
