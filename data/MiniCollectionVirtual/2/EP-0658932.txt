<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic substrate for use with a semiconductor device, 
includes an electrical conductor (2) composed of Ag, a resistor (4) 

composed of oxide, and a barrier layer (3) located between the 
electrical conductor (2) and the resistor (4) and composed of a 

material selected from a group consisting of AgPd and AgPt. The 
ceramic substrate prevents a diffusion of Ag atoms between the 

electrical conductor (2) and the resistor (4), and hence provides a 
stable internal resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a substrate composed of ceramic, on
which a high speed LSI element is to be mounted and which has an
internal resistor.These days, with a requirement of the down-sizing,
lightening, multi-functioning and highly-densifying of a computer and
a communication device, it is also required to highly integrate a
semiconductor chip and down-size electronic parts. In particular, it is
required to improve a packaging technique for electrically connecting
the chip or parts with each other. For instance, a resistor has
conventionally been mounted on a substrate, but a new method has
recently been developed in which a resistor is formed in a substrate
for mounting a larger number of parts such as resistors and electrical
conductors in a smaller area.One of such methods includes the steps of forming an
electrically conductive layer composed of Ag or AgPd on a green sheet
by means of a screen-printing process, and depositing the thus
fabricated green sheets, and then firing the deposited green sheets at
the temperature in the range of 800 to 900 degrees centigrade.However, Ag atoms have a tendency to easily diffuse. Thus,
Ag atoms in electrical conductors diffuse in a resistor at the
temperature in the range of 800 to 900 degrees centigrade, and
accordingly there is posed a problem that a resistance value presented
by a resistor remains quite unstable. To solve this problem, for
instance, JP-A-59-75603
has suggested a resistor being shaped to be concave at a longitudinally
middle portion to thereby increase a resistance at the longitudinally
middle portion which is not affected by a diffusion of Ag atoms. 
JP-A-60-253107 has
suggested forming an intermediate layer composed of an alloy
including Pd, Ru, Ni, Au and Co, for preventing a diffusion of Ag atoms.
JP-A-1-136302 has
suggested a resistive layer disposed between an Ag electrode and an
RuO2 resistor and having no Ag atoms which has a resistivity one-tenth
smaller than that of the RuO2 resistor. According to the
Disclosure, the resistive layer can stop a diffusion of Ag atoms.
However, the Disclosure does not specify a material of which the
resistive layer is to be made.
JP-A-4-342101 has suggested to mix non-electrically
conductive glass and organic vehicle in an electrically conductive
material such as RuO2 to thereby reduce a diffusion of Ag atoms into a
resistor.If a content of Pd in an electrical conductor is increased for
reducing a diffusion of Ag atoms, a resistance of the electrical
conductor is increased. This is not preferable
