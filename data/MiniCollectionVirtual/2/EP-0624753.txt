<ABSTRACT>
The headlight (headlamp) has a reflector (10) into which a light source (12) is inserted. A lens (16) is arranged remote from the reflector (10), seen in the direction (14) of light emission, and a diaphragm (18) is arranged in the beam path between the reflector (10) and the lens (16), which diaphragm has an upper edge (22) which is imaged as light/dark boundary by means of the lens (16). At least one reflection element (38) is arranged in the beam path between the diaphragm (18) and the lens (16), by means of which reflection element part of the light which is reflected by the reflector (10) is deflected in such a manner that it illuminates, after passing through the lens (16), an area which is located in front of the vehicle and above the light/dark boundary and thereby improves the ability of the driver of the vehicle to perceive the traffic situation which is above the light/dark boundary, without dazzling oncoming drivers of vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Headlight for motor vehicles, having a light
source (12), a reflector (10), a lens (16) arranged at a

distance from the reflector (10) in the light exit
direction (14), and having a mask (18) which is arranged

in the optical path between the reflector (10) and the
lens (16) and has a mask edge (22) that is projected by

the lens (16) as the light/dark interface (32, 34; 32,
36) of the light beam output by the headlight, characterized

in that at least one reflection element (38) is
arranged in the optical path between the mask (18) and

the lens (16) and deviates a portion of the light
reflected by the reflector (10) in such a way that, after

passing through the lens (16), it illuminates a region
which is in front of the vehicle and above the light/dark

interface (32, 34; 32, 36), and in that the at least one
reflection element (38) is arranged close to the optical

axis (20) of the reflector (10), below this axis.
Headlight according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the reflection element (38) has a vertical extent

which is substantially less than that of the mask (18).
Headlight according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the reflection element (38) is held

on the mask (18).
Headlight according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the lens (16) is held in a support

(44), and in that the reflection element (38) is held on
the support (44).
