<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel antitumor
agents. More particularly, the present invention relates
to 10-desacetoxytaxol and derivatives thereof.Taxol is a natural product extracted from the
bark of yew trees. It has been shown to have excellent
antitumor activity in in vivo animal models, and recent
studies have elucidated its unique mode of action, which
involves abnormal polymerization of tubulin and disruption
of mitosis. It is currently undergoing clinical trials
against ovarian, breast and other types of cancer in the
United States and France and preliminary results have
confirmed it as a most promising chemotherapeutic agent.
The structure of taxol and the numbering system
conventionally used is shown below; this numbering system
is also applicable to compounds of the present invention.
Among the objects of the present invention,
therefore, is the provision of the novel taxane, 10-desacetoxytaxol,
and derivatives thereof, which exhibit antitumor
activity.In accordance with the present invention, a
compound is provided having the following structural
formula (1):

wherein R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy or a protected hydroxy
group; R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen, hydroxy, a
protected hydroxy group, methyl, -SH, -NH2, or -NR8R9; R5
is R10, or -OR10; R6 and R7 are independently hydrogen,
alkyl, or aryl; R8 and R9 are independently hydrogen,
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or aryl; and R10 is, alkyl,
alkenyl, alkynyl, or aryl; provided that when R2 is hydrogen, R3 and R4
are independently hydrogen, methyl, -SH, -NH2, or -NR8R9.Also provided are the compounds 10-desacetoxytaxol
and 10-deoxytaxotere.Other objects and features of this invention will
be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.As used herein "Ar" means aryl; "Ph" means
phenyl; "Ac" means acetyl; "R" means alkyl; "ll-ene" means 
a double bond between carbon atoms 11 and 12 of a compound
of formula (1); and "10,12-diene" means double bonds
between carbon atoms 10 and 11, and 12 and 18 of a compound
of formula (1). "Hydroxy protecting group" includes, but
is not limited to, ethers such as methyl, t-butyl, benzyl,
p-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, allyl, trityl, methoxymethyl,
methoxyethoxymethyl, ethoxyethyl, tetrahydropyranyl,
tetrahydrothiopyranyl, and trialkylsilyl ethers
such as trimethylsilyl ether, triethylsilyl ether, dimethylarylsilyl
ether, triisopropylsilyl ether and t-butyldimethylsilyl
ether; esters such as benzoyl, acetyl, phenylacetyl,
formyl, mono-, di-, and trihaloacetyl such as
