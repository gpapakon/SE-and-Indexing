<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle slip angle measuring device includes an 
approximate calculation block (26) for deriving an 

approximate value (A) of a vehicle centroid slip angle (β) by 
use of an approximate expression derived from a linear 

two-degree-of-freedom vehicle model. The approximate 
value (A) is derived based on outputs from a steering 

wheel sensor (16), vehicle velocity sensor (18) and yaw angular 
velocity sensor (24). The device further includes a 

preprocessing block (28) for preprocessing outputs from the 
above three sensors, longitudinal acceleration sensor (20) 

and lateral acceleration sensor (22) to create input 
information. Finally, the device includes a learned 

neural network (32) for receiving the approximate value and 
input information and for outputting a correction 

value (C) corresponding to a deviation between an actual 
slip angle and the approximate value. The correction 

value (C) from the neural network is added to the 

approximate value (A) from the approximate calculation 
block to derive a precise vehicle centroid slip angle (β).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle slip angle measuring 
method and a device therefor suitable for a vehicle having a 
four-wheel steering system. A four-wheel steering system for steering the front and 
rear wheels of a vehicle when the vehicle is turning to 
enhance the turning performance and steering stability of the 
vehicle is typically operable to steer the rear wheels by an 
angle corresponding to the vehicle velocity and the steering 
angle of the front wheels. JP-A H3-243411 proposes a four-wheel 
steering system which determines the vehicle centroid 
slip angle, and steers the front and rear wheels to set the 
slip angle to zero. According to the slip angle zeroing 
control, the vehicle can face in its direction of travel even 
when it is turning. This is convenient for driving. Conventionally, for example, an optical non-contact type 
ground speed meter (vector speed meter) is used to detect the 
vehicle centroid slip angle. In that case, the vehicle 
centroid slip angle is derived from the longitudinal velocity 
and lateral velocity of the vehicle measured by the ground 
speed meter. However, the accuracy of the ground speed meter 
may be lowered depending on the road surface condition, and 
the meter large in size and expensive. Therefore, the 
practical applications of the slip angle zeroing control 
using the ground speed meter in commercially available 
vehicles are few. JP-A-4-138 970 (Kayaba) discloses a method for measuring a 
lateral slip angle of a vehicle comprising the steps of 
detecting a steering state of front wheels of the vehicle 
and outputting the steering angle of the front wheels as 
steering information; detecting a motion state of the vehicle and outputting 
longitudinal, lateral and vertical acceleration and vehicle 
speed as motion information; and supplying the front wheel steering information and the 
motion information to a learned neutral network to estimate 
an approximate value of a lateral vehicle slip angle based on  
 
the front wheel steering information and the motion 
information;  
   and an apparatus including a neural network for carrying 
out the method. An object of this invention is to provide a vehicle slip 
angle measuring method and a device therefor capable of 
determining the vehicle body centroid slip angle with high 
precision, without using a special detection device. The invention provides a method of determining a slip angle 
of a vehicle, characterised by: 
(a) detecting a steering state of front wheels of the 
vehicle and outputting
