<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process in which  alpha -, beta - and/or gamma -cyclodextrin are reacted in a suitable base with a suitable O-alkylating agent and subsequently, where appropriate after neutralisation of the reaction mixture, the resulting alkylated cyclodextrin derivatives are removed from the reaction mixture in a manner known per se, characterised in that  alpha -, beta - and/or gamma -cyclodextrin are initially dissolved in part of the base and subsequently the O-alkylating agent and further base are added.

Process in which α-, β- and/or γ-cyclodextrin are 
reacted, in a suitable base, with a suitable O-alkylating 

agent and, where appropriate following neutralization of 
the reaction mixture, the resulting alkylated 

cyclodextrin derivatives are subsequently separated, in 
a manner known per se, out of the reaction mixture, 

characterized in that α-, β- and/or γ-cyclodextrin are 
initially dissolved in from 1 to 5 mol of a suitable base 

in the form of its aqueous solution, in a concentration 
of 5-20% (w/w), per mole of cyclodextrin, and from 15 to 

25 mol of the O-alkylating agent as well as the suitable 
base, up to a maximum base concentration of from 15 to 

25 mol, are subsequently added, either simultaneously or 
in arbitrary sequence, batchwise or continuously. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the O-alkylating agent and the additional base are 

added simultaneously and continuously. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
2, characterized in that potassium and/or sodium 

hydroxide is/are employed as the suitable base. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that methyl chloride, epichlorohydrin 

and/or sodium chloroacetate is/are employed as the 
O-alkylating agent. 
Methyl-γ-cyclodextrin having an average degree of 
substitution (DS), measured by means of 
1
H-NMR 
spectroscopy, of between 1.7 and 1.9 and having an 

average degree of methylation of the O2 and the O6 
positions of from 60 to 70%. 
Methyl-α-cyclodextrin having an average degree of 
substitution (DS), measured by means of 
1
H-NMR spectroscopy, 
of between 1.7 and 1.9 and having an average degree 

of methylation of the O2 position of from 70 to 80% and 
having an average degree of methylation of the O6 position 

of from 60 to 70%. 
Use of methylated cyclodextrin derivatives 
according to one or more of Claims 5 or 6 for solubilizing 

substances which are difficult to dissolve in water.
