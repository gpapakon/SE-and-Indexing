<ABSTRACT>
An electronic camera is disclosed that 
employs a color transformation stage 14 for 

transforming primary color signals into luminance 
and chrominance signals. The luminance signal is 

subjected to a lossy compression in the compression 
stage 16a, and then decoded in the decompression 

stage 32 to generate a feedback signal having lossy 
artifacts. The feedback signal is used in the 

generation of the chrominance signals prior to 
their compression, which causes the 

later-reconstructed chrominance signals to have 
fewer artifacts due to the compression algorithm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
digital image processing in an electronic camera, and 
more particularly to methods and associated apparatus 
for improving the image quality of a color image in a 
processing system including both color transformation 
and image compression. In many digital imaging systems, the input 
color image comprises several digital records, such as 
records composed of the red, green, and blue (R,G,B) 
tri-stimulus values corresponding to the color image. 
It is common for these records to undergo some form of 
a color transformation, and then to undergo some form 
of lossy compression prior to storage or transmission; 
this is followed on the receiving side by 
decompression, and further image processing. At the 
final stage of viewing or printing the image, the color 
components are usually transformed back to their 
original values, e.g., R,G,B. An example of such a 
system is a digital camera in which an image is 
captured using an image sensor covered by a color 
filter array (CFA). The CFA generates a subsampled RGB 
record, in which, depending on the configuration of the 
CFA used, the individual R, G, and B records may be of 
different sizes. The CFA image data, which represents 
the raw image data, is usually subjected to a color 
transformation. A typical color transformation 
provides a green record G in conjunction with two color 
difference records, such as (R-G) and (B-G), or (LogR-LogG) 
and (LogB-LogG), depending on the nature of the 
image capture. To conserve storage space and/or  
 
channel capacity, the transformed image is usually 
compressed prior to storage, using any of several well-known 
compression techniques, such as predictive coding 
or transform coding. In the prior art, it is known to use color 
transforms that are suitable for images captured 
through a CFA, as well as to use transforms that 
optimize the compression performance for a given CFA 
pattern. Of relevance are the following patents:
