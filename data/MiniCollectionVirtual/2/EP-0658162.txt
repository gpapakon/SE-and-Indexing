 CARBAPENEM DERIVATIVES AND PROCESSES FOR PREPARING THE SAMEBackground of the Invention Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to novel carbapenem( 3-pyrrolidinylthio-l-azabicyclo[3,2,0 ]hept-2-ene-7-one-2-carboxylic acid compounds) derivatives, processes for preparing the derivitiveε and antibiotics containing such compounds as active ingredients.Description of the Related ArtThienamycin, (J. Am. Chem. Soc. Vol. 100, p.6491( 1978 ) ) isolated from the fermentation of the soilActinomycets, Streptomyces cattleya has antibacterial activity against gram negative gram positive bacteria.Thienamycin has strong antibacterial activities, however, thienamycin itself is chemically unstable and has been reported to be decomposed in vivo by enzymes such as renal dehydropeptidase I (hereinafter referred to DHP-I), whereby the antibacterial activities decrease, and the urinary recovery is low (Antimicrob.Agents Chemother., vol 22, p.62(1982); ditto, vol. 23, p.300(1983) ) .Merck & Co. Inc. have synthesized many thienamycin analogues to maintain the excellent antibacterial activities of thienamycin and to secure chemical stability. As a result, imipenem obtained by formimidation of the amino group of thienamycin, has been developed as a pharmaceutical product (U.S. Pat. No. 4,194,047). However, like thienamycin, imipenem is 

likely to be decomposed by DHP-I in the human kidney. Therefore, it cannot be used for treatment of infection in the genito-urinary tract. Furthermore the decomposed products are toxic to the kidneys. Therefore, imipenem cannot be administered alone and is required to be used in combination with a DHP-I inhibitor such as cilastatin (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., vol 12 (Suppl. D), p. 1(1983) ) .However, in the 1980'ε, there has been a growing demand for otable carbapenem compounds and, various carbapenem compounds having a 1 β-methyl carbapenem basic skeleton have been developed. Sumitomo Co. has synthesized meropenem which is much more stable against DHP-I than imipenem and has a broad antibacterial spectrum (EP No.126587; Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy vol. 33, No. 7, 1009(1989); Journal of Antibiotics, vol. 43, No. 5, p.519(1990) ) . Further Lederle has synthesized L.J.C. 10627 which shows improved antibacterial activities and stabilities against DHP-I.Prior art disclosed in EP No. 182213, EP No. 243686, and EP No. 411664 is well known. These references disclose carbapenem derivatives having an amidinoalkyl, ureiren alkyl, carbamoyl alkyl, alkyloxy iminoalkyl and
