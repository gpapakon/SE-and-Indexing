<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a bar processing
apparatus (2) which simplify the work operation, has a simple structure and

is highly effective for preventing the vibration of a bar (W). A bar (W) processing
apparatus (2) comprises a collet chuck (8) for chucking a leading end portion of a

bar to be machined, a spindle (6) for rotating the bar at a high speed, a hollow
tube (10) which is arranged coaxilly with the collet chuck (8) and extends from the

vicinity of the collet chuck through the spindle toward an upstream side
with respect to a feeding direction of the bar, the hollow tube being

provided with a first bar passage (12) whose ends are open and whose inner
diameter is of a size which allows to form an oil layer around the outer

surface of the bar (W) by the rotation of the bar accommodated within the bar
passage, an oil injecting inlet (14) which is open toward the inside of the hollow

tube, and oil supply means (16) for supplying oil to the oil injecting inlet (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bar processing apparatus and a bar loader and, in particular, to those which are highly effective for preventing the vibration of a bar.A bar processing apparatus, such as a NC automatic lathe for machining a leading end portion of a bar, is well known. A bar to be machined is supplied to the bar processing apparatus by a bar loader which is arranged adjacent thereto and on an upstream side thereof with respect to a feeding direction of the bar. The bar loader has a guide rail extending straight toward the bar processing apparatus. The bar is moved forward in the bar feeding direction along the guide rail by a feeding rod and is supplied to the bar processing apparatus. The bar processing apparatus has a spindle extending in a longitudinal direction thereof and the bar is fed therethrough. The leading end portion of the bar is chucked by a collet chuck, and the bar is machined by a bite while being rotated at a high speed during a manufacturing process to make products.As described above, since the bar is rotated at a high speed while being machined, the bar may interfere with the guide rail of the bar loader and/or a main shaft of the bar processing apparatus especially when the bar is bent. Such bent or flexure may cause a vibration accompanying a noise.US 5 343 788 discloses an automatic bar loader, for supplying a bar to a bar processing apparatus, having a hollow guide tube filled with a fluid which supports the trailing portion of the bar (furthest from the end to be machined) as it rotates within the tube. The bar is advanced towards the bar processing apparatus by a piston pusher connected to a pump which provides the necessary pressure.US 4 679 470 discloses a bar loader for a multi-spindle lathe which has a plurality of hollow guide tubes filled with a fluid which supports the trailing portion of each bar. The bar is advanced to the lathe by the fluid under pressure acting on a piston pusher.The object of the present invention is to provide a bar processing apparatus which simplifies a worker's operation, has a simple structure and is highly effective for preventing a vibration.The object of the present invention described above can be achieved by a bar processing apparatus, comprising: a collet chuck for chucking a leading end portion of a bar to be machined; a spindle for rotating the bar at a high speed; a hollow tube which is arranged coaxilly with the collet chuck and extends from the vicinity of the collet chuck through the spindle toward an upstream

<CLAIMS>
A bar processing apparatus (2) (30), comprising:

a collet chuck (8) for chucking a leading end portion of a bar (W) to be machined;
a spindle (6) for rotating said bar at a high speed;
a hollow tube (10) which is arranged coaxially with the collet chuck (8) and which extends from the vicinity of the collet chuck (8) through the spindle (6) toward an upstream side with respect to the feeding direction of the bar (W), the hollow tube (10) being provided with a first bar passage (12) whose ends are open and whose inner diameter is of a size which allows an oil layer around the outer surface of the bar (W) to be formed by rotation of the bar within the bar passage (12);
an oil injecting inlet (14) open toward the inside of the hollow tube (10); and
oil supply means (16,26) for supplying oil to the oil injecting inlet (14).
A bar processing apparatus (2) according to claim 1 wherein the hollow tube (10) extends out of the spindle (6) in a backward direction so that an entire bar (W) to be machined is accommodated within the first bar passage (12).
A bar processing apparatus (2) according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the oil supplied into the first bar passage (12) is a cutting oil.
A bar loader (4) (32) to be used in combination with a bar processing apparatus (2) (30) having a collet chuck (8) for chucking a leading end portion of a bar (W) to be machined; a spindle (6) for rotating the bar (W) at high speed; a hollow tube (10) which is arranged coaxially with the collet chuck (8) and which extends from the vicinity of the collet chuck (8) through the spindle (6) toward an upstream side with respect to a feeding direction of the bar (W), the hollow tube (10) being provided with a first bar passage (12) whose ends are open and whose inner diameter is of a size which allows an oil layer around the outer surface of the bar (W) to be formed by the rotation of the bar accommodated within the bar passage (2); an oil injecting inlet (14) which is open toward the
 inside of the hollow tube (10) and oil supply means (16,26) for supplying oil to the oil injecting inlet (14), comprising:

a guide rail member (34) extending straight from the hollow tube (10) toward an upstream side with respect to the said feeding direction and having an upward opening (34a); and a lid member (36) for closing the opening (34a) wherein when the opening (34a) is closed by the lid member (36), a second bar passage (46) having an inner diameter equal to that of the first bar passage (12) and extending coaxially with the first bar passage (12) is formed between the guide rail member (34) and the lid member (36); and
coupling means (88) for coupling the first bar passage (12) with the second bar passage (46) so that a continuous bar passage is formed thereby.
A bar loader (4) (32) according to claim 4 wherein each of the guide rail member (34) and the lid member (36) is adapted to be replaceable with another one having the first bar passage with an inner diameter suitable for an outer diameter of a bar (W) to be machined.
