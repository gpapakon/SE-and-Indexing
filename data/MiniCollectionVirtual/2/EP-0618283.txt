<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a poisoning-preventive 
layer-possessing support for preventing a 
catalyst from poisoning by silicon or phosphorous, and 
also relates to a catalyst having resistance to 
poisoning by silicon or phosphorous, an exhaust gas 
converter device, which employ noble metals, such as Pt 
and Rh, as catalytic components and which are used for 
cleaning automotive exhaust gases or digestion gases 
resulting from sludge digestion (the two kinds of gases 
being hereinafter inclusively referred too as exhaust 
gases), and a poisoning-preventive gasoline composition. Automotive exhaust gas catalytic converters are 
commonly used in automobiles to prevent environmental 
pollution because the catalytic converters greatly 
reduce air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen 
oxides, etc. without lowering the output and fuel 
efficiency of the engines. With recent improvements in the combustion 
systems in engines, the concentrations of unburned 
ingredients in exhaust gases have become low. As a  
 
result, catalytic converters are now mainly employed. 
Catalysts for use in these catalytic converters include 
an oxidation catalyst, a reduction catalyst, and a 
three-way catalyst, each consisting of a ceramic support 
of the pellet or monolith-type and a particular 
catalytic component deposited on the support. Such 
catalytic components include, for example, noble metals 
such as Pt, Rh, etc. Catalytic converters are also used in industrial 
engines (e.g., engines for use with digestion gases 
formed by the digestion of organic sludges such as 
sewage sludges). However, the known catalytic converters have the 
following problem. Silicon (including various Si-containing 
compounds), for example, siloxane gas 
(Si(CH₃)nO or (CH₃)₂SiO) and phosphorus, for example, 
phosphoric acid and phosphate (such as H₃PO₄, HPO₃ and 
H₄P₂O₇) (hereinafter, silicon and phosphorus are inclusively 
referred to as Si etc.) are often present in 
exhaust gases, mainly because silicones or the like are 
used in large quantities as sealing materials, i.e., 
formed in-place gasket (FIPG) for present-day automotive 
parts and phosphorus is contained in oils. Further, 
sand and dust, dispersed in the air, may come into the 
intake air and be introduced into the engine. In the  
 
case of engines used with digestion gases, there are 
also situations where Si etc. enters into the fuel. 
Because of Si etc., the noble metals, such as Pt and Rh, 
used as catalytic components are likely to be poisoned 
or clogged.
