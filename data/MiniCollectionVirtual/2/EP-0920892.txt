<ABSTRACT>
A video game apparatus includes a CPU. The CPU determines straight lines
respectively connecting between the player object and a North Pole, target and marker,

and determines respective directions of a direction pointing mark, target pointing mark
and marker pointing mark to point direction parallel to the straight lines. The player

object or other objects are combined with these pointing marks, and displayed on a
display.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a three dimensional display video game apparatus and memory medium used therefor. There is described herein a novel video game apparatus which is adapted to show on the game screen a direction in which the player object is to move, a particular azimuth and the like, and a memory medium used therefor.In the conventional role playing or action games, a two dimensional size-reduction map is displayed at a corner on the screen through reducing the size of a two dimensional scene as viewed from the above of a map for the game, thereby displaying a position of a player object using points or symbols on the map. Also, some games are adapted to display a destination that a player object is to advance, using a symbol on a size-reduction map.In the conventional technique of displaying symbols or marks on a size-reduction map, there is a necessity to create a size-reduction map in relation to the creation of image or polygon data or background map scenes for the game. Due to this, the background map scene, if changed, causes a requirement to change the size-reduction map in a corresponding manner, thereby complicating programming.With the conventional size-reduction map display technique, the player has to look at both a player object and a size-reduction map simultaneously or sequentially while playing the game. There has been a disadvantage that the player is forced to frequently move his line of sight, leading to fatigue in his eyes.Furthermore, if a size-reduction map be applied to a currently popular game utilizing three dimensional image representation, the size-reduction map is displayed in a two dimensional form, despite the player object or its background scene, etc. being displayed in three dimensions. Accordingly, the player has to ponder on the relationship between a direction or movement of a player object existing in the three dimensional space and its position being displayed on the size-reduction map. This may cause confusion in game manipulation or erroneous finding about a position of the player object in the three dimensional scene. Thus there has been difficulty in operating a three dimensional image displaying video game.A review of a game Golden Gate on the Intemet -'Golden Gate - Main Review' [ONLINE], April 1997 (1997-04), pages 1-3, XP002156671 Retrieved from the Internet:
