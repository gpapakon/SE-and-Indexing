<ABSTRACT>
Device for transmitting television pictures in the form of transform 
coefficients and motion vectors. The motion vectors of a sub-picture are converted (20) 

into a series of difference vectors and a reference vector. Said series is subsequently 
applied to a variable-length encoder (22) which encodes a run of zero values and a 

subsequent non-zero value into a code word of variable length. The variable-length 
encoder may be the same as the encoder which encodes the coefficients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for transmitting television pictures
and to a device for receiving television pictures thus transmitted. Both devices may be
combined in one apparatus, constituting a video recorder.A device for transmitting television pictures of the type described in
the opening paragraph is known from European Patent Application EP 0 556 507. The known
device comprises means for dividing each television picture into blocks; means for forming a
motion vector for selected blocks; means for arranging the motion vectors of contiguous
blocks forming a sub-picture into a reference vector and a plurality of difference vectors, the
motion vector of a selected block constituting the reference vector; and a variable-length
encoder for encoding the reference vector and the difference vectors into code words of
variable length.With the known device, a certain extent of encoding efficiency is
aimed at.It is an object of the invention to further improve the encoding
efficiency of the device.According to the invention the device is therefore characterized in that
the variable-length encoder is of a type which allocates a code word of variable length to
series of zero values and a subsequent non-zero value, the difference vectors of a sub-picture
being applied to said encoder prior to the reference vector of said sub-picture.The invention is based on the recognition that moving objects in a
picture are generally larger than one block. This means that the blocks of a sub-picture
generally comprise the same quantity of motion. The difference vectors then have a value of
zero, whereas the reference vector is often unequal to zero. By applying the motion vectors in
the form of a series of difference vectors followed by the reference vector to a decoder which 
allocates one variable-length code word to a series of zero values and a subsequent non-zero
value, the device will often compress the motion information of a sub-picture to one code
word only.The difference vectors are preferably formed from the motion vectors
of contiguous blocks. The difference in motion of a block with a contiguous block is smaller
than with a more remote reference block because contiguous blocks generally have a larger
extent of corresponding motion. The difference vectors thus more frequently have the value of
zero and are then encoded more efficiently.In a preferred embodiment of the device the variable-length encoder is
constituted by the variable-length encoder for encoding coefficients which are obtained from
picture
