<ABSTRACT>
An optical module comprises an optical connector (R) at the 
receiver side and an optical connector (T) at the 

transmitter side, and hybrid IC's (23, 24) for the receiver 
side and the transmitter side are mounted on a lead frame 

(3). The lead frame (3) comprises a projecting part (3e) 
projecting outside from a part where each hybrid IC (23; 

24) is mounted. Nearby the connection part between the 
optical connector (R; T) and the hybrid IC (23; 24), the 

projecting part (3e) is connected to a ground pattern (S) 
on a surface of the hybrid IC by a bonding wire (4). The 

wire (4) is placed at this location, so that the effect of 
noise caused by an atmospheric electric wave, or GND/power 

lines can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical module 
which is sealed by mold material. In recent years, packaging techniques for semiconductor 
integrated circuits have made great progress and various 
kinds of electronic parts are packaged with high density. 
Therefore, it is an important subject to reduce noises 
caused by the adjacent electronic parts. In general, a 
noise source is an atmospheric electric wave generated by 
the adjacent electronic parts, a noise of power source 
through GND/power lines or others. In particular, 
countermeasure for the noises is important for an optical 
module which converts a feeble optical signal into an 
electric signal. In the conventional optical modules, for certain 
electronic parts installed inside, a metal shielding board 
was installed or instead of the electronic parts, other 
circuit parts for reducing noise were mounted. However, in such shielding structure in which the 
electronic parts were shielded, a shielding member larger 
than the electronic parts was installed, and in particular, 
in a case that shielding was required on a same substrate,  
 
a region occupied by the shielding member on the substrate 
was substantially large. This hindered the advance of 
miniaturizing a module. For the electronic parts, an additional process of 
installing the shielding member was required, which caused 
both an increase of the number of processes of manufacturing the 
optical module and a fall of the productive efficiency. Further, there was a practical problem that in the resin 
molding type products, the shielding member was broken by 
the stress when resin was poured. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
optical module which can reduce the effect of noise caused 
by an atmospheric electric wave or GND/power lines without 
reducing the mounting density of the circuit substrate 
which constitutes the optical module. It is another object of the present invention to provide 
an optical module with a configuration which hardly 
receives the stress when the resin is poured. It is another object of the present invention to provide 
an optical module at low cost and with good productivity. The above and other objects will be apparent from the 
following description. According to the present invention, an optical module 
sealed by mold material is provided. This optical module 
comprises a light receiving device for converting an  
 
optical signal into an electric signal, a first substrate 
comprising a circuit which is electrically connected to
