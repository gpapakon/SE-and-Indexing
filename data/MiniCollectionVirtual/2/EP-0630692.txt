<ABSTRACT>
A sorting machine is disclosed in which a viewing 
window is electro-optically observed using an array of 

photodetectors, each observing a photo site or pixel of the 
viewing window. Each photodetector, and thus each photo site 

can be normalised individually to account for background and 
photodetector sensitivity differences from photo site to 

photo site. The machine can sample the outputs of the 
photodetectors sequentially and, by deriving respective 

binary "pass" and "fail" signals and supplying these 
sequentially to the serial input of shift register 100 

incorporated in processing means can reject products 
affording a series, of more than a predetermined number, of 

"fail" signals and thus reject products that have a larger 
than acceptable number of adjacent defective photo sites. 

Also disclosed is a circuit (Figures 3 and 4) for rejecting 
a defective product based on sensing where its trailing edge 

is or should be if covered up by a successive overlapping 
product. Such detection also allows for rejecting products 

that are either too long or too short. All of this is done 
by digital processing resulting from the digitizing 

permitted by photo site detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION pertains to sorting machines used to sort 
fungible products, such as nuts and many other agricultural 
products, by passing the products along a channel having a 
viewing window and detecting products that are substandard 
in shade from those that are within standard limits and 
rejecting those that are substandard. A typical sorter of fungible products of the type just 
described is comprised of one or more channels that are 
gravity fed with the products from a top loaded hopper, the 
products flowing in the channel in a fairly constant stream 
and sometimes overlapping one another. The channel background 
is electro-optically observed through a viewing 
window, while no products are flowing, by at least one 
photodetector to produce an output that is representative of 
that background. Although only one photodetector is used in 
a very simple machine, it is common to employ multiple 
photodetectors, for example, three, viewing the product 
flow from various different viewing angles. The background 
for each photodetector is separately determined 
for such machines. This process of determining a signal  
 
representative of the background without product flow is 
know as "normalizing". When the product flow is initiated and the actual 
product flow is electro-optically sensed, the background 
signal is subtracted from the total output so that the 
background is discounted in determining whether the product 
flow includes all standard or acceptable products or 
includes a substandard product now and again. Assuming the 
latter, when a substandard product is sensed by an electro-optical 
photodetector by having at least a portion of its 
surface area being either lighter or darker than a standard 
shade, then a reject signal is produced, following a 
suitable delay, to activate a reject mechanism, which 
diverts the substandard product from the channel. The 
delay is necessary for the product to fall below the 
viewing window and be opposite the reject mechanism. The 
reject mechanism is typically a burst or jet of air that 
blows the substandard product out of the ordinary channel 
flow to drop into a reject bin. From time to time, product flow must be suspended for 
the viewing window to be either blown clean or wiped clean 
of dust and to again determine a new "normalizing" value 
for the background shade. Although such prior art sorting machines as generally 
described above have used digital logic in switching from 
sort mode to normalizing mode and for determining the 
timing delay
