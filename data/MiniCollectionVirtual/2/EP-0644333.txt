<ABSTRACT>
A pump control system has a pump unit composed of a 
turbo pump, a motor for operating the turbo pump, and a 

frequency/voltage converter for generating a frequency and a 
voltage to energize the motor. The rotational speed of the 

turbo pump is varied in order to equalize the current of the 
motor to a constant current irrespective of the head of the 

pump. The pump can be operated to take fully advantage of the 
current capacity of the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump control
system, and more particularly to a system for controlling the
operation of either a high-specific-speed turbo pump such as an
axial-flow pump or a mixed-flow pump for use in relatively high
flow rate and low head applications, or a low-specific-speed
pump for use in relatively low flow rate and high head
applications, by adjusting the rotational speed of the pump
operated by a motor with a frequency/voltage converter (static
inverter).For varying performance characteristics of a pump
which is operated by an induction or synchronous motor, there
has heretofore been employed a static inverter to vary the
frequency of the power supply of the motor to adjust the
rotational speed of the pump. To set a rotational speed for
the pump, a manual or automatic setting signal is generated by
a frequency signal generator within the control range of the
inverter which usually ranges from 0 % to 120 % of the primary
frequency of the inverter.Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 57-52396,
for example, discloses an induction motor control apparatus for
equalizing the point of intersection between a load torque
curve and a motor torque curve to the maximum efficiency point
of the motor at a motor input frequency corresponding to the
motor torque curve. With the disclosed induction motor control 
apparatus, the induction motor operates at a maximum efficiency
at all times irrespective of the motor input frequency at which
the induction motor is energized. Regardless of the rotational
speed of a fan coupled to the induction motor, the induction
motor can be operated at the maximum efficiency point which
corresponds to the motor input frequency at the time.Another induction motor control apparatus disclosed
in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 59-44997 has a
circuit for correcting the output voltage of an inverter
depending on the load current of an induction motor so that the
output voltage of the inverter reaches a voltage to maximize
the efficiency of the induction motor. The disclosed induction
motor control apparatus allows the induction motor to be
operated highly efficiently irrespective of the operating head
of a pump driven by the induction motor, simply by adjusting
the primary voltage of the motor depending on the load torque.Still another induction motor control apparatus has
a static inverter for controlling the output power of an
induction motor which operates a pump into a constant level, as
disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No.
