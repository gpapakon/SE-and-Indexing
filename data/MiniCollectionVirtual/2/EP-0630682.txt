<DESCRIPTION>
Plasma polymer membranes, or those prepared by 
plasma polymerization, show great potential for commercial 
fluid separations because they can be made highly 
selective for the permeation of one species over another 
in a mixture. This high selectivity is due to their 
highly crosslinked structure in which intermolecular 
spacings are rigidly maintained--thus creating holes 
through the polymer network of reasonably uniform size. 
Permeating molecules pass through the holes in the polymer 
network and the rate of permeation is greatly 
influenced by the size of the permeating molecules. This 
so-called "sieving mechanism" for molecular permeation is 
believed to be responsible for the very high selectivities 
that have been observed for some plasma-polymerized 
membranes. Plasma polymer membranes are also potentially 
useful as barrier films to provide a seal against fluids 
such as water or air. In such cases, the polymer is 
prepared in such a way to exhibit a very dense and highly 
crosslinked impermeable structure. However, two major 
drawbacks have kept plasma polymer membranes from wide 
commercial application: (1) they tend to be brittle and 
highly prone to fracturing; and (2) they generally have 
low permeabilities and thus must be made exceedingly thin 
to obtain practical fluxes in separation applications. The brittleness of plasma polymer membranes is 
due to their highly crosslinked structure and due to the 
plasma polymerization mechanism itself. This subject is 
discussed in detail by Yasuda in Plasma Polymerization 
Academic Press, New York, New York, 1985, and by Yasuda  
 
et al., in 46 J. Membrane Sci. 1 (1989). During the 
plasma polymerization process internal stresses build 
within the polymer film and increase with increasing film 
thickness. At some point, the internal stress within the 
film exceeds the cohesive strength of the plasma polymer 
and cracking occurs; or the adhesive strength between the 
plasma polymer film and the adjacent polymer film layer 
or a rigid substrate is exceeded and delamination occurs. 
The internal stress of plasma polymer films and their 
tendency to form cracks and other defects can be reduced 
by such factors as reducing the film thickness, the 
proper choice of monomer, and by selection of plasma 
polymerization conditions. In the fabrication and use of practical 
separation devices using plasma polymer membranes, four 
principal modes of failure have been observed: (1) as 
prepared, the membranes contain defects or form cracks 
which result in
