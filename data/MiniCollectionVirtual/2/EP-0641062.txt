<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a small motor (miniature motor) having a two-pole, permanent-magnet rotor (5) and a stator (3) having a U-shaped laminated core, whose limbs (3a, 3b) form magnetic poles (3d) in the end region (3c) for the rotor (5), the limbs (3a, 3b) having two excitation coils (field coils) wound on them, which conduct alternately, three winding layers (7a, 7b, 7c; 9a, 9b, 9c), which are interleaved one above the other, being fitted in two winding groups (7, 9) on both limbs (3a, 3b) as excitation coils, that winding layer which is located entirely on the outside (7c or 9c respectively), firstly, and that winding layer which is located entirely internally (7a or 9a respectively), secondly, of the first and second limbs (3a, 3b) respectively, and the central winding layer (9b or 7b respectively) of the second or first limb respectively, thirdly, being connected in series with one another.

<CLAIMS>
A small motor having a permanent-magnet rotor (5) and a stator (3) 
having a U-shaped lamination assembly having limbs (3a, 3b) whose end portions (3c) 

form magnetic poles (3d) for the rotor (5), the limbs (3a, 3b) carrying two alternately 
conducting exciter coils, 
characterized in that
 the exciter coils on both limbs (3a, 3b) 
comprise three nested winding layers (7a, 7b, 7c; 9a, 9b, 9c) in two winding groups (7, 

9), of which firstly an outer winding layer (7c and 9c, respectively) and secondly an 
inner winding layer (7a and 9a, respectively) of the first limb and the second limb (3a 

and 3b), respectively, and thirdly the central winding layer (9b and 7b, respectively) of 
the second limb and the first limb, respectively, are connected in series with one 

another.
