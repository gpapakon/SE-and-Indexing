<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a plurality of wall elements (1) which can be fitted together to form a mobile partitioning wall. For sound insulation and fixing the wall elements between ceiling and floor, a ceiling seal moulding (8) and a floor seal moulding (9) are provided. These interact with a pneumatic lifting member (20) via a linkage (16, 16'). The lifting member (20) contains a bellows. Compressed-air coupling valves are provided on both narrow sides of the wall element (1). When wall elements (1) are fitted together, the coupling valves are opened for the throughflow of compressed air, and thus for the actuation of the lifting member (20).

<CLAIMS>
A mobile partitioning wall having several wall elements 
(1) suspended on a running rail (2), having sealing 

strips (9) associated with each wall element, with an 
upper sealing strip (8), which is height-adjustable in 

relation to the wall element (1) and can be pressed 
against the running rail (2), and a lower height-movable 

sealing strip (9), which is also height-adjustable in 
relation to the wall element (1) and can be pressed 

against the floor (14), being provided, the two sealing 
strips (8, 9) cooperating with at least one displacement 

device (20) movable in the vertical direction,
characterised in that
 the vertical movement of the 
sealing strips is performed by at least one pneumatically 

operated lifting device (20) and at the two vertical 
narrow sides of the wall elements (1) pneumatic coupling 

valves (30, 32) intended to cooperate are provided, 
which, when two adjacent wall elements (1) are slid 

together, are tightly flow-connected with one another and 
with the at least one lifting device (20) by a compressed 

air line (36),
and in that
 at least one of the coupling valves (30, 32) 
is constructed as a check valve and a manually-operated 

decompression valve (34) is provided in the compressed 
air line (36). 
A partitioning wall according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a two-part rod assembly (16, 16') 
is situated between the upper and lower sealing strips 

(8, 9) in the interior of a wall element (1), and 
cooperates with a common lifting device (20) for moving 

the rod assembly (16, 16') to opposite sides, and a 
return spring (18) is associated with each of the two 

rods (16, 16'), which move the sealing strips (8, 9) into  
 

their non-sealing position when the lifting device (20) 
is unpressurised. 
A partitioning wall according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the lifting device (20) is a pair 
of bellows made of elastic material, against the end 

sides of which the two-part rod assembly abuts (16, 16').
