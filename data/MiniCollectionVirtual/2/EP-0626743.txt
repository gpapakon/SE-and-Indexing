<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a line fault monitor 
for detecting a short circuit in a terminal-side loop line and 

disconnecting the short-circuit portion from a power supply, so 
that the position of the short circuit can easily be specified. 

The line fault monitor includes at least one of a mid-point 
line monitoring device and a beginning/end line monitoring 

device. The mid-point line monitoring device has a first 
fault indicator lamp for indicating a fault in a line connected 

to one terminal, and a second fault indicator lamp for 
indicating a fault in a line connected to the other terminal. 

The beginning/end line monitoring device in the side of a 
receiver has a first fault indicator lamp for indicating a 

fault in a line connected to a beginning terminal, a second 
fault indicator lamp for indicating a fault in a line connected 

to an end terminal, and a representative fault indicator lamp 
for representatively indicating a fault in any one of the lines 

connected to the beginning and the end terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a line fault monitoring
apparatus as indicated in the precharacterizing part of
claim 1.
Such a line fault monitoring apparatus is disclosed in US-A-5 097 259.A conventional line fault monitoring apparatus, which is
called a short-circuit isolator, is also disclosed in
Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO. 63-19098.In such a line fault monitoring apparatus, lines in a terminal side
are connected to a receiver in a loop manner, and one or more
short-circuit isolators are provided in the loop lines. If a
short circuit occurs in the lines, the short-circuit isolators
positioned in both sides of the short-circuit portion
disconnect the short-circuit side. Then, the power is supplied
to the remaining normal lines so that the monitoring condition
is maintained.As shown in Fig. 15 which is a system explanation
diagram of the Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO.
63-19098, the line fault monitoring apparatus includes the following elements.
A receiver 301 stores a power source and receiving circuit 301a
therein. A pair of power/signal lines 302a and 302b
extend from the receiver 301 from terminals 311, 312. The lines are
returned to the receiver 301 in a loop form. Between the lines 
302a and 302b connected to the receiver 301 in a loop form,
terminal loads 303 which are a relay, sensor or the like is
connected in parallel, and further, line fault monitors 304a
and 304b are inserted and connected in each group in which a
predetermined number of the terminal loads 303 are provided.
According to the insertion and connection of the line fault
monitors, the loop connected lines 302a and 302b are separated
into sections of L1, L2, and L3. Further, the receiver 301 is
provided with a pair of line fault monitors 315a and 315b, each
having power source side terminals 309 and 310, and which are
connected with each other and a receiver circuit 301a,
and having respective load side terminals 311 and 312 of the line fault
monitor 315a and 315b as loop connection terminals to the
receiver 301.Further, Japanese Patent Publication No.
SHO. 62-73400 discloses an alarm apparatus in which a pair of
lines which are power line and power/signal line are separated
in a plurality of sections and an isolating circuit is provided
in each section. If a short circuit occurs in one section,
the section is isolated by the isolating circuit so as to
prevent shutting down the system. In addition, the isolating circuit
includes a latching relay having an isolation contact inserted
in the line. Furthermore, the
