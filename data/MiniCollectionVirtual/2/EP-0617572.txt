<ABSTRACT>
A data bus coupler includes a plated composite housing and a plurality of twin 
axial contacts, the shielding portions of each contact being connected to the housing 

by a conductive insert which serves to retain the contacts in the connector. The 
coupler also includes a printed circuit board carrying transformers and isolation 

resistors for providing stub connections to a data bus line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors, and more particularly to a
shielded electrical connector including data bus coupling circuitry.A data bus coupler is an electrical connector which permits splitting of data
signals without attenuation of the signal strength. The data bus typically includes a
single, twisted, pair of wires and a cable shield which protects transmitted data from
magnetic and electrostatic interference. The coupler typically includes a bus line
which connects an input contact to an output contact, and a number of branch or stub
contacts tapped into the bus line via transformers. The resulting multiplexed data bus
coupler enables the use of smaller and lighter twinaxial cables instead of complicated, 
heavy and dedicated cabling. Desirable qualities in a data bus coupler are that the
coupler be compact, lightweight, electromagnetically sealed, and able to withstand
severe environmental conditions.One such data bus coupler is disclosed in Patent No. 4,720,155. The coupler
of Patent No. 4,720,155 includes a metallic shell, an apertured ground plate to
connect the shields of the contacts to the shell, a dielectric contact retention member,
and a circuit board which carries a transformer and isolation resistors. The ground
plate fits between the main housing and a rear can enclosure which encloses the
circuit board.The coupler disclosed in Patent No. 4,720,155 provides a compact and
effectively shielded structure. However, for many applications, it would be desirable
to reduce even further the weight, number of parts, and size of such a coupler,
without reducing its shielding effectiveness.From US-A-4611873 there is further known an insert assembly that enables more than one coaxial contact to be mounted within and grounded to a connector housing.It is an objective of the invention to provide a less complex shielded
electrical connector in which a ground plane and dielectric contact retention member
are replaced by a conductive insert assembly which serves as both a contact retention
member and as a ground path between the housing and the contacts.This objective is achieved, according to the
invention, by (1) providing an electrical connector as defined in claim 1.Figure 1 is a side view, partially in cross section, showing a twinaxial data bus
coupler connector arrangement according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.Figure 2 is an end view of the data bus coupler connector of Figure 1. Figure 3a is a cross-sectional side view of a conductive insert for use in the
data
