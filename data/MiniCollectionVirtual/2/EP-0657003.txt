<ABSTRACT>
A valve with presetting facility has a valve housing (1) with a rotatable sleeve (12). To form a preset throttle (35), a control opening (33) at the base (14) of the sleeve co-operates with a control opening (34) at a base face (8) of the valve housing (1). The control opening (34) in the base face (8) is formed by an eccentric bore (9). The control opening (33) in the end face (15) of the base (14) is formed by a channel (31) which extends over a circular arc of less than 360 , is connected at one end by way of an eccentric bore (18) to the inner space (21) of the sleeve (12) and has a cross section that reduces towards the other end. That allows presetting to be very precise and manufacture to be inexpensive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a valve with presetting 
facility, having a valve housing, which has an inlet 
nipple and an outlet nipple, a valve shaft, the closure 
member of which co-operates with a valve seat, and 
a cylindrical sleeve arranged concentrically about the 
valve shaft, which sleeve has a substantially closed 
base lying with its end face against a base face fixed 
with respect to the housing, spaced therefrom the valve 
seat, and in its circumferential wall at least one 
through-flow opening leading to one of the nipples, and, in 
order to adjust a preset throttle that is formed by 
eccentrically arranged overlapping control openings in 
the end and base faces, the sleeve is arranged to be 
rotated and be fixed in position. A valve of that kind in the form of a radiator 
valve is known from DE-PS 22 53 462. The presetting 
serves to limit the maximum flow of heating medium 
through the associated radiator. The two control 
openings are half-moon shaped openings in the base and 
in a plate set in the valve housing. The sleeve is 
coupled with a bushing that guides and seals the valve 
shaft, and can therefore be externally adjusted. 
Maximum flow volume is produced when the two control 
openings coincide with one another exactly. By 
rotating the sleeve the overlap region is reduced and 
thus a limit on the amount flowing through is set. The plate set in the housing is required because 
it is difficult to create a half-moon shaped opening 
inside the valve housing. This is an expensive 
solution, however, because the plate has to be secured  
 
against rotation, and for that reason has a pin-like 
member which engages in an extra bore in the valve 
housing. In addition, it is difficult to set the 
desired flow rate exactly. That applies particularly 
when the flow rate is to be restricted to small amounts 
and in so doing the required setting tolerances are to 
be observed. These are as follows: 
in the range from 0-10 kg/h the flow rate is +/- 3 
kg/h, in the range from 11-33 kg/h the flow rate is +/- 
6 kg/h. The invention is based on the problem of providing 
a valve of the kind mentioned in the introduction which 
can be manufactured at less expense and, with a simple 
setting procedure, allows an exact limitation to be set 
even at low flow rates. This problem is solved according to the invention 
in that the base face is integral part of the valve housing, the 
control opening in the base face is formed by an 
eccentric bore that is connected by way of a transverse 
bore to the other of
