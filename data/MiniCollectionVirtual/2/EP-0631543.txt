<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a vehicle wheel rim and to a method of manufacturing the wheel rim. The wheel rim is comprised of an outer hub (10), an inner hub (12) and a rim base (14), and the outer hub (10) includes a first male-type snap coupling means (16) and the inner hub (12) includes a female-type snap coupling means (22) for locking the inner hub (12) to the outer hub (10). The outer hub (10) also includes a second male-type snap coupling means (18) and the rim base (14) includes a female-type snap coupling means (24) for locking the outer hub (10) to the rim base (14). The space formed between the inner hub (12), the outer hub (10) and the rim base (14) is filled with foam (34), to obtain a strong sandwich construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle wheel rim 
and to a method for its manufacture. One of the aims of present day car manufacturing 
industries is to reduce the total weight of cars, by 
reducing the weight of car components. This is 
achieved by optimizing existing constructions, choosing 
lighter materials, finding new material combinations 
(composites), or using different manufacturing methods 
(see for instance the document SE-B-370 357). 
At the same time, the car industry is extremely 
sensitive with regard to product design and consequently 
methods which enable design changes without 
incurring too much expense are often chosen. Normally, solely steel rims are used as standard on 
the wheels of private cars. Although these rims can be 
produced relatively cheaply, they greatly limit design 
possibilities. In order to satisfy customers who 
desire a special rim design, special rims made of 
aluminium or magnesium are available instead. These 
rims, however, demand a much higher price and are just 
as heavy as corresponding steel rims. Furthermore, 
more energy is consumed in the manufacture of magnesium 
or aluminium rims and the manufacture of such 
rims creates a dirtier environment than the manufacture 
of corresponding steel rims. These special design 
rims are also susceptible to damage from external 
mechanical sources and create many problems when 
attaching balancing weights to the rims. These problems are solved by means of an inventive 
wheel rim having the characteristic features set forth 
in the characterizing clause of the following Claim 1 
and by a method for the manufacture of the wheel rim, 
in accordance with the characterizing clause of Claim 
5. The lightness and mechanical strength of the  
 
inventive wheel rim is achieved in that the rim includes 
an outer hub, an inner hub and a base, wherein 
the inner hub and the outer hub include respectively 
male and female type snap coupling means which function 
to lock the inner hub to the outer hub, and 
wherein the outer hub and the rim base include respectively 
male and female type snap coupling means which 
function to lock the outer hub to the rim base. The 
space defined between the inner hub, the outer hub and 
the rim base is filled with foam and glue, so as to 
obtain a strong and light sandwich construction. The invention will now be described in more detail 
with reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof 
and also with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
in which 
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle wheel rim, particularly a car wheel rim, 
comprising an outer hub (10), an inner hub (12), and a 

rim base (14), wherein the outer hub (10) and the 
inner hub (12) have a number of holes (28) for receiving 

through-passing wheel bolts (30), 
characterized
 
in that the inner hub (12) and the 

outer hub (10) include female and male type snap 
coupling means (22, 16) for locking the inner hub (12) 

to the outer hub (10); in that the outer hub (10) and 
the rim base (14) include male and female type snap 

coupling means (18, 24) for locking the outer hub (10) 
to the rim base (14); and in that the space defined 

between the inner hub (12), the outer hub (10) and the 

rim base (14) is filled with foam (34) to obtain a 
strong sandwich construction. 
A wheel rim according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the snap coupling means (16, 

22) of the inner hub (12) and the outer hub (10) are 
arranged at the centre (32) of the hub; and in that 

the space defined between the inner hub (12), the 
outer hub (10) and the rim base (14) is filled with 

two-component glue and polyurethane foam (34). 
A wheel rim according to Claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that the locking effect of the snap 

coupling means (16, 22; 18, 24) is achieved by virtue 
of the fact that the cross-sectional shapes of respective 

male and female snap coupling means (16, 22; 18, 
24) are mutually the same but of mutually different 

size; in that the inner hub (12) is welded firmly to 
the rim base (14); and in that the outer hub (10) is 

also glued to the rim base (14). 
A wheel rim according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the inner hub (12) and the rim 

base (14) are manufactured from boron steel; and in  
 

that the outer hub (10) is manufactured from either 
boron steel, aluminium or a plastic material. 
A method of manufacturing a wheel rim according to 
Claim 1, comprising: 


pressing an inner hub (12) including a female snap 
coupling means (22) from steel plate; 
pressing an outer hub (10) including a first male snap 
coupling means (16) and a second male snap coupling 

means (18) from steel plate; 
roll-forming and welding from steel plate a rim base 
(14) which includes a female snap coupling means (24); 
fitting the inner hub (12) to the rim base (14) and 
welding said hub and said base together to form a sub-assembly; 

heating the sub-assembly (12, 14) to the 
requisite tempering temperature; 
placing the sub-assembly (12, 14) in a fixture and 
cooling said sub-assembly; 
fitting the outer hub (10) to the sub-assembly (12, 
14) and gluing said hub to said sub-assembly, said 

outer hub being fitted so that the female snap coupling 
means (22) of the inner hub lock to the first 

male snap coupling means (16) of the outer hub and so 
that the female snap coupling means (24) of the rim 

base lock to the second male snap coupling means (18) 
of the outer hub; and 
injecting glue and foam (34) into the space defined 
between the inner hub (12), the outer hub (10) and the 

rim base (14), to form a strong sandwich construction. 
A method according to Claim 5, 
characterized
 
by placing the sub-assembly comprised 

of the mutually welded inner hub (12) and rim base 
(14) in a fixture and calibrating the measurements of 

the unit; and subjecting the sub-assembly in said 
fixture to a heat treatment stage;
 
wherein the heat treatment stage is effected in a tempering 

oven; and
 
wherein cooling in the cooling stage is effected with  

 
water. 
A method according to Claim 6, 
characterized
 
in that the glue and foam (34) used in
