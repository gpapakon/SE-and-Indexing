<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating a concrete or other non-metallic surface 
contaminated with embedded radionuclides to reduce the total 

level of radioactivity in a concrete or other hydraulically 
bonded material body is described. The method comprises the steps 

of producing relative mutual movement between the surface to be 
removed and a laser heat source such that a layer adjacent the 

surface is caused to be detached from said concrete body. The 
surface may be detached as a vapour, in flakes or as a sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of treating a non-metallic
surface, particularly a contaminated surface having
embedded contaminants in the surface layer or layers, and more
particularly, though not exclusively, a surface contaminated with
radionuclides.In the nuclear industry surfaces of objects such as mechanical
components and constructional features become contaminated with
radionuclides. Common contaminants include uranium oxide,
plutonium oxide, strontium-90, caesium-137 and cobalt-60. These
contaminants may be present in the form of fine particulates or
originate from solutions containing them. Where such contaminants
are deposited on concrete structures, the porous nature of
concrete means that the contaminants may be present up to a
considerable depth. However, the principal proportion of the
contaminants, about 90%, are situated within a few millimetres
of the surface. Hence, the safe removal of the surface layer or
layers can greatly reduce the degree of radioactive contamination
present.Various techniques have been proposed for the decontamination of
surfaces. However, due to the embedded nature of the
contaminants, the prior art techniques of chemical washing, fluid
shear blowing and paste/stripping have not been entirely
successful. Furthermore, these prior art methods have the
disadvantage of producing secondary waste problems due to mixing 
of the additional materials with the removed contamination and
most importantly, they only remove surface contaminants, not
contaminants embedded below the surface.JP 3002595 describes the removal of a concrete surface layer by
crushing due to the heat generated by the use of microwaves to
irradiate the contaminated surface layer.DE 3500750 describes inductively heating steel reinforcing bars
within a structure to cause the removal of contaminated concrete
therefrom.In our co-pending patent application number PCT/GB90/02404, we
describe the use of an intense heat source passed across a
contaminated surface to fix or seal the radioactive contaminants
therein.In all of these prior art treatments the radioactive contaminants
remain in large pieces of material which require disposal in
large pieces, or which require further processing, or the
contamination is sealed into the structure body, thus not
decreasing the total level of radioactivity of the body or
structure in question. One of the principal problems of the prior
art methods described is that they produce large pieces of
concrete which have a very high proportion of relatively
uncontamin

bonded material body (20; 40), the method comprising the
steps of producing relative mutual movement between the

surface to be removed and a laser heat source (24; 50), the
method being characterised in that a layer (22; 62)

adjacent the surface is caused to be detached from said
