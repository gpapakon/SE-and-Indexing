<ABSTRACT>
A slurry containing a precursor fiber convertible to carbon fiber 
and/or a carbon fiber and a thermosetting resin is processed into 

a random web. The web is hot-pressed between a pair of belts while 
curing of the resin is inhibited to prepare a prepreg sheet. 

The sheet is disposed, leaving a clearance, in a mold having ribs 
on a molding surface and heated over the melting point of the resin 

for expansion and complete cure to provide a porous composite sheet 
equipped with grooves. This porous composite sheet is carbonized 

or graphitized to produce a porous carbonaceous material for use 
as a fuel cell electrode material and so on. This porous carbonaceous 

material has high homogeneity, gas permeability, electrical 
conductivity, heat conductivity and mechanical strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a porous carbonaceous 
material which can be used in the manufacture of 
electrodes for the phosphoric acid electrolyte fuel 
cells, electromagnetic shields, electrically conductive 
sheets, carbonaceous cushioning materials, high-temperature 
vacuum furnace refractory wall or insulating wall 
materials, etc., a method for producing a porous composite 
sheet useful for the production of the porous 
carbonaceous material, and a method for producing the 
porous carbonaceous material. Because of their good heat resistance, corrosion 
resistance, electrical conductivity and mechanical 
strength, carbonaceous materials are in broad use as 
fuel cell electrode materials, electromagnetic shielding 
materials and so on. Among carbonaceous materials, 
materials in the film or sheet form, such as graphite 
sheets, can be bonded to, for example, a wall surface 
to impart heat resistance, corrosion resistance and 
electromagnetic shielding properties. However, since a graphite sheet is generally produced 
by a method which comprises subjecting naturally-occurring 
graphite serially to acid treatment and heat  
 
treatment, mixing the thus-treated graphite with a 
binder, and compression-molding the mixture into a film 
or sheet, it is not only non-porous but also is fairly 
low in electrical conductivity, heat conductivity, 
mechanical strength and cushioning characteristics, 
thus being seriously restricted in application. Meanwhile, a carbon plate can be produced by a 
process which comprises mixing a textile fiber which 
can be carbonized or graphitized and/or a carbon fiber 
with a particulate binder which can be carbonized or 
graphitized, forming the mixture into a plate under the 
application of heat and pressure and subjecting the 
plate to carbonization or graphitization. This kind of 
carbon plate can be used as, for example, a fuel cell 
electrode material. Unlike other kinds of power generating devices, 
the fuel cell mentioned above is characterized in that 
the evolution of pollutants such as SOx, NOx and dust 
is minimal and, moreover, in that it is scarcely a 
source of noise. Among the known types of fuel cells, 
the phosphoric acid electrolyte fuel cell comprises a 
stack of separator-isolated unit cells each comprising 
a porous negative electrode and a porous positive electrode 
as disposed on respective sides of the electrolyte. 
For the provision of gas passageways, usually 
the surfaces of the negative and positive electrodes 
are formed with grooves by
