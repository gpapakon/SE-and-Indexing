<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disubstituted polycyclic compounds,
to pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods of use in
mammals to treat cognitive disorders, neurological dysfunction, and/or
mood disturbances such as, but not limited to degenerative nervous
system diseases. Additionally, these compounds can be used as
reagents in studies on the biochemical mechanism of neurotransmitter
based diseases.Increasingly there is a need for effective treatments for
nervous system disorders and neurological deficiencies. Many of these
diseases correlate with increasing age due mainly to degenerative
changes in the nervous systems. Although in early stages of some
diseases, certain systems are rather specifically affected (e. g.,
cholinergic systems in Alzheimer's Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, the
dopaminergic system in Parkinson's Disease, etc.), multiple
neurotransmitter system deficiencies (acetylcholine, dopamine,
norepinephrine, serotonin) are generally found at later stages of
disease such as senile dementia, multi- infarct dementia, Huntington's
Disease, mental retardation, etc. This explains the generally observed
multiple symptomatology that includes cognitive, neurological, and
effective/psychotic components (see Gottfries, Psychopharmacol., 1985,
86, 245). Deficits in the synthesis and release of acetylcholine in the
brain are generally thought to be related to cognitive impairment (see
Francis, et al., New England J. Med., 1985, 7, 313) whereas
neurological deficits (e. g. Parkinsonian symptoms) and mood/mental
changes may be related to impairment of dopaminergic and
serotonergic systems, respectively. Other neurological deficits (e. g.
Myasthenia Gravis) are related to cholinergic deficiencies in the
peripheral nervous system.Treatment strategies employed previously encompass
vasoactive drugs like vincamine and pentoxifylline; metabolic 
enhancers like ergoloid mesylates, piracetam, and naftidrofuryl;
neurotransmitter precursors like I-DOPA, choline, and 5-hydroxytryptamine;
transmitter metabolizing enzyme inhibitors such as
physostigmine; and neuropeptides like adrenocorticotropic hormone
and vasopressin-related peptides. Except for I-DOPA treatment for
Parkinson's Disease and cholinesterase inhibitor treatment for
Myasthenia Gravis, these treatment strategies have generally failed to
enhance the residual function of the affected systems by enhancing the
stimulus-induced release of neurotransmitters. Theoretically, such an
enhancement would improve the signal-to noise ratio during chemical
trans
