<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a guiding and protecting system particularly for the safety of traffic routes, the guiding and protecting system having a plurality of identically constructed interconnected guiding bases (1) arranged in a row and capable of being arranged at an obtuse or flat angle relative to one another, each guiding base being provided in the region of one end with a first projection (2) and in the region of the opposite end with a second projection (3), and the connection of neighbouring guiding bases being effected in overlapping fashion in the region of the projections of the guiding bases. So that the guiding and protecting system can be assembled in a structurally simple manner and at the same time is fashioned to be visually attractive and, in addition, exhibits a high stability under the effect of impact, irrespective of the material used, the invention proposes that the first projection (2) of one guiding base (1) is provided with a peg (5), the peg axis (12) of which runs perpendicularly to the supporting plane (4) of the guiding base (1) on the ground, and the second projection (3) of the neighbouring guiding base (1) is provided with a recess (8) for receiving the peg (5) in the latter in a manner free from play, and also the neighbouring end faces of neighbouring guiding bases (1; 1) have curved faces (14, 17; 15, 16), the centre of curvature of which coincides with the longitudinal axis (5; 8) of the assigned peg (5) and of the assigned recess (8), respectively.

Routing-protection system, especially for the 
securement of traffic routes, the routing-protection 

system having a plurality of identically configured, 
interconnected routing pedestals (1), which are arranged 

in a row and can be disposed at an obtuse or flat angle 
to one another, the respective routing pedestal being 

provided in the region of one end with a first protrusion 
(2) and in the region of the opposite end with a second 

protrusion (3) and the adjacent routing pedestals being 
joined in overlapping arrangement in the region of the 

protrusions of the routing pedestals, characterized in 
that the first protrusion (2) of the one routing pedestal 

(1) is provided with a lug (5), the lug axis (12) of 
which runs perpendicular to the bearing plane (4) of the 

routing pedestal (1) on the ground and the second 
protrusion (3) of the adjacent routing pedestal (1) being 

provided with a recess (8) for the play-free reception of 
the lug (5) therein, and the adjacent end sides of 

adjacent routing pedestals (1; 1) having complementarily 
curved faces (14, 17; 15, 16), the midpoint of curvature 

of which coincides with the longitudinal axis (12; 13) of 
the associated lug (5) and associated recess (8) 

respectively. 
Routing-protection system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the first protrusion (2) is formed 

by a protrusion portion (2a) and the lug (5). 
Routing-protection system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the second protrusion (3) rests on 

the ground and the protrusion portion (2a) of the first  
 

protrusion (2) is disposed at a distance from the ground 
in accordance with the height of the second protrusion 

(3). 
Routing-protection system according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the cross-section of the 

routing pedestal (1) is tapered in the direction of the 
end (7) facing away from the ground. 
Routing-protection system according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the lug (5) is configured 

as a truncated cone, which ends at a distance from the 
bearing plane (4) of the routing pedestal (1). 
Routing-protection system according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the second protrusion (3) 

of the one routing pedestal (1) and that region of the 
adjacent routing pedestal (1) which interacts therewith 

have the complementarily curved faces (16; 17). 
Routing-protection system according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the routing pedestal (1) 

consists of recycled plastics material.
