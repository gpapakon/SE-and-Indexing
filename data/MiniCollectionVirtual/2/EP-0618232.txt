<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a highly viscous 
polysaccharide produced by a microorganism belonging to the 
genus Klebsiella which is useful as a stabilizer for a heat-resistant 
oil-in-water (hereinafter abbreviated as O/W) 
emulsion and as a stabilizer for a water-rich water-in-oil 
(hereinafter abbreviated as W/O) emulsion, a process for 
producing the polysaccharide, a method for preventing oxidation 
of fats and oils in an emulsion by addition of the 
polysaccharide, and an analgesic composition containing the 
polysaccharide as an active ingredient. A method for preventing fats and oils from oxidation is 
applicable to wide fields using fats and oils in an emulsified 
state, for example, foodstuffs, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, 
agricultural chemicals, and industrial products such as 
coatings. A number of polysaccharides produced by microorganisms 
are known. Typical examples of the polysaccharides include 
xanthan gum produced by Xanthomonascampestris, dextran 
produced by Leuconostocmesenteroides, pullulan produced by 
Aureobasidiumpullulans, and curdlan produced by Alcaligenesfaecalis. 
These polysaccharides have found broad application 
as, for example, food additives, such as thickeners,  
 
dispersants, quality modifiers, emulsion stabilizers, etc. in 
the field of food; concrete fluidizing agents in the field of 
construction industry; and a plasma substitute in the medical 
field. Among known polysaccharides produced by microorganisms 
belonging to the genus Klebsiella is substance BS-1 produced by 
Klebsiellapneumoniae disclosed in JP-A-4299986, Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi 1988, 54(10), 1817-1821 (Japan) and U.S. Patent 4,975,371 
(corresponding to JP-B-2-19121, the term "JP-B" as used herein 
means an "examined published Japanese patent application"). 
US-4,286,059 discloses a process for preparing a heteropolysaccharide 
from Klebsiella pneumoniae.Of these polysaccharides, xanthan gum and pullulan have 
high viscosity at room temperature and inhibit agglomeration of 
emulsion particles and are therefore widely utilized as an 
emulsion stabilizer. However, when they are exposed to high 
temperatures, the viscosity thereof is reduced, unavoidably 
causing emulsion break, i.e., phase separation into oil and 
water. Accordingly, they have difficulty in maintaining 
emulsion stability when they are added to foodstuffs subject to 
heat sterilization, such as retorted foods. In the field of 
emulsified fat and oil foodstuffs, it is known to use an 
emulsifying agent in combination with a stabilizer
