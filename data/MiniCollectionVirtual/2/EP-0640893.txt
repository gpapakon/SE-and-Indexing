<ABSTRACT>
Shock absorbing members (70) are attached to an 
outer rim of a back surface of a wristwatch case body 

(55) at 6- and 12-o'ciock positions thereof, and they 
extend outward and curve downward. Each of the absorbing 

member has rising portions (70a) extending from its 
both side ends under wrist bands (71) freely swingably 

attached to the case body to a circumferential surface 
of the case body. A part of a front surface and the 

circumferential surface of the case body are covered by 
a first cover (61) made of soft synthetic resin, and 

the first cover is partly covered by a metal-made second 
cover (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wristwatch
case having a shock resistant structure.As the shock resistance structure, it is well known
that a cover made of soft synthetic resin is attached to
the wristwatch case. This cover decorates the
wristwatch case and also serves to resist any shock
applied to front and circumferential surfaces of the
wristwatch case.No shock resistance structure is provided on a back
surface of the wristwatch case because the back surface
contacts directly a wrist of an user.In some of wristwatches, a pair of wrist bands
are attached to the wristwatch case at 6- and 12-o'clock
positions thereof and are curved backward at all times
to fit an outline of the wrist.In the case of wristwatches having these wrist
bands, the wrist bands serve as a cushion to absorb any
shock applied to the back surface of the wristwatch case
when the wristwatch is dropped on the floor, for
example. However, the wrist bands themselves must be
curved backward and unswingable at any time. Therefore,
an attaching structure of the wrist bands to the
wristwatch case, material of the wrist bands, and design
thereof are limited. In US 1,378,747 it is described to provide a protector or
case for a pocket watch made of rubber. The entire area of
the outer face of this protector is formed without standing
projections, to prevent the watch from falling easily from
the wearer's pocket and to constitute a cushion when the
watch is accidentally dropped.From US 3,149,452 it is known to attach to the rear of a
watch case a cushioning device to cushion or protect the
watch. Such a device mainly comprises a sheet of foam
material, preferably a synthetic resin foam, such as
polyester, polyurethane, vinyl foam.CH-A-193 967 describes means to keep a wristwatch away from a
wearer's arm, in order to protect the watch from
disadvantageous effects of body heat and perspiration. Such
distance keeping means is stated to be a punctured plate of
metal or plastic.An object of the present invention is therefore
to provide a wristwatch case having a shock resistant 
structure to resist any shock applied to a back surface
of the wristwatch case but having no limitation in an
attaching structure of wrist bands to the wristwatch
case and being comfortable to wear. This is achieved
by a wristwatch case according to claim 1.This invention can be more fully understood from
the following detailed description when taken in conjunction
with the accompanying drawings, in which:
