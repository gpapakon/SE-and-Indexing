<ABSTRACT>
A picture display device has a vacuum envelope and is provided with a face plate whose inner side supports a luminescent screen, a rear wall situated at a short distance therefrom, and the space inbetween accommodating a plurality of electron sources which cooperate with a plurality of electron transport ducts with walls which comprise a dielectric material for transporting, through vacuum, produced electrons towards positions at a small distance from the luminescent screen. Means for reducing the effects of undesired charge transfer of the duct walls are provided to improve the start-up and/or steady state electron transport conditions. In a practical embodiment the outer sides of the duct rear walls are provided with a (start-up) conductor means to which an initiation potential is applied, which is equal to or higher than the potential applied for producing the electron transport field.

<DESCRIPTION>
Flat-panel type picture display device.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to a picture display device having a vacuum envelope which is provided with a transparent face plate with a luminescent screen for displaying pictures composed of pixels and with a rear wall, which display device comprises a plurality of sources for emitting electrons, electron transport ducts cooperating with the sources and having walls of a dielectric material for transporting, through vacuum, emitted electrons towards positions at a short distance from the luminescent screen, and means for accelerating the electrons towards the luminescent screen.The display device described above is of the flat-panel type, as disclosed in EP-A-436997. Display devices of the flat-panel type are devices having a transparent face plate and, arranged at a small distance therefrom, a rear plate, with the inner surface of the face plate being provided with a pattern of phosphor dots or stripes. Electrons impinging upon the luminescent screen may be controlled to form a visual image which is visible via the front side of the face plate. The face plate may be flat or, if desired, curved (for example, spherical or cylindrical).The display device described in EP-A-436997 comprises a plurality of juxtaposed sources for emitting electrons, local electron-propagation means cooperating with the sources and each constituting electron transport ducts, each having walls of a dielectric material having a secondary emission coefficient suitable for propagating emitted electrons, and an addressing system with electrodes (selection electrodes) which can be driven row by row for withdrawing electrons from the propagation means at predetermined extraction locations facing the luminescent screen, further means being provided for transporting extracted electrons towards the luminescent screen for producing an image composed of pixels.The operation of the picture display device disclosed in EP-A-436997 is 

based on the recognition that electron propagation is possible when electrons impinge on a wall of a high-ohmic, substantially electrically insulating material (for example, glass or synthetic material) if an electric field of sufficient power is generated over a given length of the wall (by, for example, applying a potential difference across the ends of the wall). The impinging electrons then generate secondary electrons by wall interaction, which electrons are propagated towards a further wall section and in their turn generate secondary electrons
