<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
an apparatus and a method for
removing contaminants from a surface
according to the preambles of claims 1, 5 and 29 (see US-A-5 024 968).
More particularly, the invention relates to the removal of contaminants from a
substrate surface by irradiation that does not alter the molecular crystal structure
of the treatment surfaces.Surface contaminants include discrete pieces of matter that range
in size from submicrons to granules visible to the unaided eye. Such
contaminants may be fine dust or dirt particles or unwanted molecules
comprised of elements such as carbon or oxygen. Contaminants frequently
become adhered to a surface by weak covalent bonds, electrostatic forces, van
der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, coulombic forces or dipole-dipole
interactions, making removal of the contaminants difficult.In certain instances, the presence of surface contaminants renders
the contaminated substrate less efficient or inoperable for the substrate's
designated purpose. For example, in certain precise scientific measurement
devices, accuracy is lost when optical lenses or mirrors in the devices become
coated with microfine surface contaminants. Similarly in semiconductors, surface
defects due to minor molecular contaminants often render semiconductor masks
or chips worthless. Reducing the number of molecular surface defects in a 
quartz semiconductor mask by even a small amount can radically improve
semiconductor chip production yields. Similarly, removing molecular surface
contaminants, such as carbon or oxygen, from the surface of silicon wafers
before circuit layers are deposited on the wafer or between deposition of layers
significantly improves the quality of the computer chip produced.Moreover, a significant portion of the debris that ultimately
contaminates silicon wafers during production emanates from production
apparatus such as process chambers in which the wafers are placed and pipes
that conduct processing gas to the chambers. Accordingly, the level of wafer
contamination experienced during the course of production can be significantly
reduced by the periodic cleaning of such apparatus.The need for clean surfaces free of even the finest contaminants
has led to the development of a variety of surface cleaning methods. These
known methods, however, each have serious drawbacks. For example, wet
chemical cleaning eliminates metal ions and soluble impurities, but fails to
remove particulate. Conversely, scrubbing techniques eliminate particulate, but
employ devices that require
