<ABSTRACT>
A console for a display unit work station comprises at least one visual display unit, processors for controlling the visual display unit and an associated control board (operator desk) for interactive communication with the visual display unit, as well as a power supply unit, which are all accommodated in a console housing which is closed off at least to the control board. A housing opening allows a view of the screen of the at least one visual display unit, and the control board is arranged on the outside of the console housing underneath the housing opening. To prevent a long-term loss of display quality of the screen due to mechanical wear of its surface, the housing opening is completely covered by at least one transparent panel which is hermetically sealed along its four lateral edges on the one hand with respect to the front housing wall and on the other hand with respect to the screen of the visual display unit.
