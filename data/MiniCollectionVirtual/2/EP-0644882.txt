The compounds of formula (I) are preferably prepared from diaminomonochloropyrimidine compounds and a corresponding piperazine component. The compounds of formula (I) have a pharmacological activity in themselves; it is more important, however, that they can be used as substituents in the preparation of lipid peroxidation-inhibiting substances.
