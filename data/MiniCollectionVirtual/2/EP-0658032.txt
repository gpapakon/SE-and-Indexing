<ABSTRACT>
A monitor probe (21) for a communications signalling network, such as an SS7 
network, is arranged to determine its own location on the signalling network by 

watching for a particular type of message which carries the required information in its 
routing label. The routing label of a message is the part of the message indicating the 

source and destination points for the message as well as providing link-related 
information for cases where more than one link connects two signalling points. Whilst 

the routing label of most messages on an SS7 network does not give a reliable 
indication of the absolute identity of the link on which the message was monitored, in 

the case of signalling link test messages, the routing label contains the identity of the 
two points (20) at the end of the link on which the message was monitored as well as 

the identity of the link as between that link (18A) and any other parallel link (18B, C); 
these items of information form an absolute identifier for the link (18A) which the 

message was monitored.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to location identification in a communications signalling
network, and in particular, but not exclusively, to a monitor probe that automatically
identifies its location in a signalling network operating substantially in accordance with
Signalling System N.7, as specified by the CCITT, such a network being herein
referred to as an SS7 network. The CCITT Signalling System Number 7 is specified in
Recommendations Q.700-Q.716 CCITT Volume VI - Fascicle VI.7, Geneva 1989,
ISBN 92-61-03511-6.In modern communications technology it has become common practice to provide two
related but separate network infrastructures: a transmission network for carrying end-user
data traffic, and a signalling network for controlling operation of the transmission
network in accordance with control signals transferred through the signalling network.
In practice such signalling networks comprise high-speed computers interconnected by
signalling links; computer programs control the computers to provide a set of
operational and signalling functions in accordance with a standardized protocol. One
example of such a signalling protocol is the aforementioned Signalling System No. 7
(SS7) which is being extensively deployed for control of telephone and other data
transmission networks. An SS7 network basically comprises various types of
signalling points, namely, signalling end points (SEPs) and signalling transfer points
(STPs) interconnected by signalling links, the SEPs being associated for example with
respective service switching points (SSPs) of the transmission network, and service
control points (SCPs). The large size and complexity of the transmission network entails a correspondingly
large and complex signalling network, controlled by very sophisticated computer
programs. The complexity of signalling networks is increased by the need to provide
redundancy to ensure that failure of a single component of the network does not cause
failure of the entire network, and thus of the associated transmission network. Thus,
for example, it is common in SS7 networks to provide each SSP or SCP with at least
two signalling links to respective members of a pair of geographically-separated STPs.In order to be able to carry out independent monitoring of the signalling network,
monitor probes may be temporarily or permanently installed on one or more links to
monitor messages flowing on the link or links. By monitoring these messages it is
possible to gain an insight into the behaviour of the network and to detect faults.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus intended for connection to a telecommunications signalling
network (10), said network having a plurality of signalling points (11,13)

interconnected by signalling links (18), the network being arranged to carry messages
of several different types with each message including both message type

information as well as routing information (42), said routing information identifying
for at least one message type, but not all said types, the signalling points directly

connected by the link carrying the message concerned and the identity of that link,
said apparatus having interface means (22) for interfacing the apparatus with a said

signalling link and being 
characterised by
:

   monitoring means (23) connected to the interface means for monitoring
messages on the link to which the apparatus is interfaced, said monitoring means

including link-identity detector means (30) responsive to the presence of a message
of said at least one message type on said link, to read and store the routing

information contained in the message of said at least one message type.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said network (10) is an SS7 network.
The apparatus of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein at least certain of said signalling
points (11,13) are directly interconnected by more than one link (18) in parallel and

said routing information (42) identifies each said link as between that link and any
other parallel link.
The apparatus of any one on the preceding claims, including reporting means
(25) for reporting the stored routing information (42) to a remote management station

(17).
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the apparatus includes means (32) for
storing apparatus identification information relating to the apparatus, said reporting

means (25) sending said apparatus identification information to the remote
management station (17) along with said stored routing information (42) whereby to 

enable the management station to associate the apparatus with the link (18) identified
by said stored routing information.
The apparatus of claim 4 or claim 5, wherein the monitoring means (23) is
operative to collect data on messages carried by said link, said reporting means sending

this data to said remote management station (17) along with said stored routing
information.
