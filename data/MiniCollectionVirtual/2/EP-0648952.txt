<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an air operated disc brake with a brake caliper (2) which surrounds a brake disc (1) and on one side of which is arranged an application device with a pivotably mounted lever (4) which rests approximately in a longitudinally central position by means of an eccentric on a crossmember (7) which extends parallel to the axis of rotation, is guided in a manner which allows it to be displaced relative to the brake disc and is screwed adjustably into the actuating spindle (70, 71), of which there is at least one, which acts via a pressure piece seated on its brake-disc end on a brake shoe (10) mounted in the brake caliper on the application side in such a way as to be displaceable relative to the brake disc, an adjusting device acting in such a way on the actuating spindle(s) (70, 71) that the release clearance, which changes as a result of lining wear, remains essentially constant. In order to ensure that no change in the release clearance occurs under imposed vibrations, the proposal is to provide a device which prevents any turning of the threaded spindle(s) (70, 71) up to a certain torque. An alternative proposal is to lock the synchronisation device in the released condition of the brake. Another solution is to provide each actuating spindle at its brake-disc end with spur toothing which engages in corresponding mating toothing on its pressure piece.

Air-operated disc brake comprising a brake calliper
including a brake disc (1), with a brake application

means with a pivotally supported rotating lever (4)
being disposed on one side of the calliper, which

rotating lever bears against a cross arm (7) extending
in parallel with the axis of rotation by means of an

eccentric (6) in an approximately longitudinally central
position, which cross arm is guided so as to be

displaceable relative to the brake disc (1) and in which
at least one adjusting spindle (70, 71) is screwed so as

to be adjustable, the latter acting via a thrust member
(72, 73) located at its end which is on the brake disc

side on a brake shoe (10) which is supported so as to be
displaceable relative to the brake disc (1) in the brake

calliper (2) on the brake application side, wherein a
regulating means acts on the adjusting spindle(s) (70,

71) in such a way that the venting clearance, which
varies as a result of wear of the lining, remains

substantially constant,
characterised in that

a means (80, 800, 810, 815) is provided which prevents
any rotation of the adjusting spindle(s) (70, 71) up to

a specified torque, wherein the said means is a
resilient element formed as a friction ring and acting

directly on the thread surface of the adjusting
spindle(s) (70, 71).
Disc brake according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the friction ring (80) consists of rubber or a
similar material, is fastened to the end of the relevant

threaded bore in the cross arm (7) that faces and/or
faces away from the brake disc and has an internal

diameter which is smaller than the external diameter of
the adjusting spindle(s) (70, 71) (Figs. 1A, 1B).
