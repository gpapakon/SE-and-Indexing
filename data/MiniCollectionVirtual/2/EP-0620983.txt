<ABSTRACT>
On a filter assembly machine (1), a succession of 
groups (8), each consisting of two cigarette portions, a 

double filter between the two cigarette portions, and a 
gummed strip (9) connected integral with and projecting 

from the group (8), is fed by an input conveyor (19) to 
a transfer station (7) where each group (8) is 

transferred into a respective seat (31, 32) on a rolling 
device (3) with multiple rolling channels (34); each 

gummed strip (9) being fed on to the respective group 
(8) so as to project forwards from the group (8) in the 

traveling direction of the input conveyor (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing filter-tipped cigarettes. Filter-tipped cigarettes are normally produced 
from double cigarettes, each formed by rolling a gummed 
strip of paper material about a group consisting of two 
cigarette portions separated axially by a filter twice 
as long as that of a finished filter-tipped cigarette. The strips are normally rolled about said groups 
by means of a rolling device to which the groups are 
normally fed by an input roller with a number of 
peripheral seats. Each seat receives and retains by 
suction both a respective group, and a respective gummed 
strip with one end connected to the group, along a 
generating line of the group opposite the seat, and 
projecting rearwards from the group in relation to the 
rotation direction of the input roller. US Patent n. 4,848,371 relates to a so-called 
"multiple-channel" rolling method. Here and hereinafter, the term "multiple-channel 
rolling" is intended to mean a rolling method whereby  
 
each group is fed to a respective transfer conveyor by 
which it is fed along a respective rolling channel in 
turn traveling along a given path. More specifically, as described in US Patent 
n. 4,848,371, the input roller transfers the groups 
successively to a central rolling device or drum 
substantially tangent to the input roller at a transfer 
station, and rotating, at a first given speed equal, at 
the transfer station, to that of the input roller, about 
an axis parallel to the rotation axis of the input 
roller. The central drum comprises a ring of peripheral 
transfer rollers, each mounted on the drum so as to 
rotate, in relation to the drum, about a respective axis 
parallel to the rotation axis of the drum, and so as to 
define, with a peripheral portion of the drum, a 
respective rolling channel moving at said first speed 
along a circular path. Each transfer roller presents a 
respective peripheral seat which, by virtue of the 
central drum and the respective transfer roller rotating 
about their respective axes, travels through the 
transfer station together with and at the same speed as 
a corresponding seat on the input roller, and is 
supplied by the input roller with a respective group and 
strip, which it feeds along said respective rolling 
channel. At the end of the rolling operation, said seat 
receives the newly formed double cigarette and, in the 
same way as for pickup but in reverse, transfers it to a 
seat on an output roller.

A method of producing filter-tipped cigarettes, 
the method comprising stages consisting in feeding, by 

means of an input conveyor (19) and in a given direction 
along a first given path (P1), a succession of groups 

(8), each comprising two cigarette portions, a double 
filter between the two cigarette portions, and a gummed 

strip (9) connected integral with, along a generating 
line of, and projecting from, said group (8); and 

successively transferring said groups (8) into 
respective seats (31, 32) on a rolling device (3) of the 

type presenting multiple rolling channels (34); the 
rolling device (3) feeding said seats (31, 32) along a 

second path (P2) tangent to the first path (P1) at a 
transfer station (7); characterized by the fact that 

each said gummed strip (9) is fed on to the respective 
group (8) along a third path (P3) tangent to the first 

path (P1), and in such a manner as to project frontwards 
from the group (8) in said given direction. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that it comprises a further stage consisting 

in retaining by suction the front portion of each said 
strip (9) as the strip (9) travels along said first path 

(P1). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by the fact that the front portion of each 

said strip (9) is removed pneumatically from said first  
 

path (P1) at said transfer station (7). 
A method as claimed in any one of the foregoing 
Claims, characterized by the fact that said first path 

(P1) is circular. 
A method as claimed in Claim 4, characterized 
by the fact that each said group (8) is fed 

precessionally by the rolling device (3) along said 
second path (P2) which is substantially circular. 
A method of producing filter-tipped cigarettes, 
the method comprising stages consisting in successively 

feeding respective transfer conveyors (30) with groups 
(8), each comprising two cigarette portions, a double 

filter between the two cigarette portions, and a gummed 
strip (9) connected integral with, along a generating 

line of, and projecting from, said group (8); winding 
each strip (9) about the respective group (8) by feeding 

the group (8) along a respective rolling channel (34) by 
means of the respective transfer conveyor (30) moving at 

a first speed (V3); and feeding each rolling channel 
(34) along a given path at a second speed (V2); each 

transfer conveyor (30) presenting a seat (31, 32) for a 
respective said group (8); and each group (8) being 

transferred into the respective said seat (31, 32) off 
an input conveyor (19) substantially tangent to said 

path at a transfer station (7); characterized by the 
fact that each said gummed strip (9) is fed on to the
