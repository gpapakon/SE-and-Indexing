<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-ended low-pressure discharge lamp 
comprising a discharge tube filled with gas and additive and sealed 

in a gas-tight manner and provided with electrodes connected to 
current conductors at its ends, and an electronic unit provided with a 

support board and circuit components for operating the discharge 
tube, and a housing having a base for insertion into a lampholder, 

and the discharge tube is composed of tube members connected to 
each other in a way to allow the passage of the discharge. The 

housing has a hollow base supporting part to accept the electronic 
unit and a discharge tube supporting part fixed to the base 

supporting part and holding the discharge tube, and the discharge 
tube supporting part has a connection portion and a mantle placed 

around the connection portion, and the mantle is provided with 
primary adapter members and the base supporting part, with 

secondary adapter members fitting to the shape of the primary 

adapter members. 
The characteristic feature of the invention is that the inside 
surface 21e of the mantle 21b of the discharge tube supporting part 

21 is, in the neighborhood of at least a portion of the primary adapter 
members 22, provided with support extensions 23 serving for  

 
accepting and fixing the support board 14a and made from the 

material of the discharge tube supporting part 21, while the 
longitudinal axes 23a of the support extensions 23 are preferably 

parallel to the axis 21g of the discharge tube supporting part 21.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a single-ended low-pressure discharge lamp comprising a 
discharge tube filled with gas and additive and sealed in a gas-tight manner and 
provided with electrodes connected to current conductors at its ends, and an electronic 
unit provided with a circuit board and circuit components for operating the 
discharge tube, and a housing having a base for insertion into a lampholder, and the 
discharge tube is composed of the tube members connected to each other in a way to 
allow the passage of the discharge, and the housing has a hollow base supporting part 
to accept the electronic unit and a discharge tube supporting part fixed to the base 
supporting part and holding the discharge tube, and the discharge tube supporting part 
has a connection portion and a mantle placed around the connection portion further 
the mantle is provided with primary adapter portions and the base supporting part 
with secondary adapter portions fitting to the shape of the primary adapter portions, 
the primary adapter portions are lugs forming the continuation of the mantle of the 
discharge tube supporting part and protruding from the edge of the mantle, while the 
secondary adapter portions are slots sunk into the wall of the base supporting part, 
further the circuit board is positioned parallel to axis of the discharge lamp. Nowadays, energy-saving light sources are being more and 
more extensively used worldwide. Their popularity is due to the 
favorable light output and illumination properties as well as the long 
life combined with the low energy required. Of the light sources of 
this kind, perhaps the so-called "compact" fluorescent lamps enjoy 
the highest popularity. Their essential feature is that they have a 
discharge tube composed of several tube members placed parallel to 
each other.  
 Compact fluorescent lamps, although having favorable 
illumination and economical features, suffer from the disadvantage 
that - due to the constructional features of these light sources - they 
are difficult to fit to luminaires designed for conventional 
incandescent lamps. The problem has become even more severe with the 
widespread use of electronically operated versions. The reason for 
this is that in the case of these versions the housing supporting the 
fluorescent lamp must Incorporate the operating electronic unit as 
well and the latter requires accessory components for being placed 
and fixed inside the housing and also needs a substantial amount of 
space. A solution for placing the circuit
