<ABSTRACT>
Ski boot comprising a shell (2) with overlapping flaps 
(3,4) and improved watertightness. An elastically deformable 

tab (6) is in fact provided on the lateral edge (5) of at 
least one of the flaps (3) and is partially or fully folded 

toward the other flap (4). This allows optimum tightness 
when the shell is secured and equally optimum tightness 

while walking, once sports activity has ended.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved watertight
ski boot comprising a shell with overlapping flaps and in
which watertightness is improved.The problem of reducing the infiltration of water in
the ski boots during sports practice is strongly felt: in
the ski boot shells, the overlap of the flaps in fact does
not eliminate the possibility of water infiltrations inside
the boot.The flaps are in fact made of relatively rigid
material, and during use undergo mutual sliding movements
that lead to the forming of small openings, especially along
the edges of the flaps.As a partial solution to these drawbacks it is known to
apply a rubber or plastic block, especially at the
transverse edges of the flaps, which has the purpose of
creating a mechanical obstacle against the flow of water
from the toe to the flaps during sports practice.Watertight sealing devices are also known which are
constituted by two separate inserts applied separately on
different edges of the flaps of the shell; one of the two
inserts is arranged at a longitudinal edge of a flap.The second insert is in turn constituted by two parts:
one is inserted at the transverse edges of the flaps of the
shell, whereas the other one is associated transversely to
the first one toward the toe of the ski boot.Even this known solution, illustrated in Italian patent
no. 1,039,942 filed on 18 July 1975, has drawbacks: first of
all there are three components which must be partially
assembled to one another and to the shell, and secondly the 
interaction of all these components with one another and
with the flaps still does not ensure optimum watertightness
between them.In any case, all these solutions have the additional
drawback of allowing considerable water infiltration once
the shell closing levers have been disengaged, for example
to allow the skier to walk.In such conditions, the flaps no longer interact with
one another, thus forming wide gaps for water infiltration.EP-A-0 572 775, which is a document within the meaning
of Article 54(3) EPC, discloses a ski boot with a pair of
overlapping flaps, and a flexible sheath connected over the
flaps for preventing moisture from entering between the
flaps. The flexible sheath has a folded portion between the
edges of flaps for allowing such flaps to be opened.An aim of the present invention is to solve the
described technical problems, eliminating the drawbacks of
the prior art and providing a ski boot which allows optimum
tightness against water infiltrations in ski boots that
comprise a shell with

Improved watertight ski boot, comprising a shell
(2,102,202) with overlapping flaps (3,103,203,4,104,204,

304,404,504,604,704,303,403,503,603,703), at least one of
said flaps having an elastically deformable tab (6,106,206,

306,406,506,606,706) that is at least partially folded
toward the other flap such that a free end or edge of said

tab interacts with the other one of said flaps when the
flaps are mutually open and such that the tab deforms

elastically when the flaps are mutually closed.

said tab (6) is formed on the lateral edge (5) of said first

flap (3) and can be folded in an elastically deformable
manner inside said shell toward said second flap (4).
Ski boot according to claim 3, characterized in that
said tab (6) forms an acute angle with the inner lateral

surface (7) of said first flap (3).
Ski boot according to claim 4, characterized in that
the free end of said tab (6) interacts in an elastically

deformable manner with the outer lateral surface of said
second flap (4).
Ski boot according to claim 5, characterized in that
when the flaps are secured, said tab can be partially or 

fully accommodated within an adapted seat (8) formed
longitudinally with respect to said second flap (4).
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in that
the tab (106,206) is formed on the lateral edge (105,205) of

said second flap (104,204) and can be folded in an
elastically deformable manner outside said shell (102,202)

toward said overlying first flap (103,203).
Ski boot according to claim 7, characterized in that
said tab (106) forms an acute angle with the outer lateral

surface (109) of said second flap (104) and its outward edge
interacts with the inner lateral surface (107) of said first

flap (103).
Ski boot according to claim 7, characterized in that
said tab (206) forms an obtuse angle with the outer lateral

surface (209) of said second flap (204) and its outward edge
interacts with the inner lateral surface (207) of said first

flap (203).
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in
that said flaps (303,304,403,404,503,504,603,607) are

associated with said shell (302,502,602) by means of
fastening means (333,433,533).
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in
that said tab (506,606) is provided at said flap (503,604)

at a distance from the edge (605) of said flap.
Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in
that said tab (6,106,206,306) is provided at the edge

Ski boot according to claim 1, characterized in
that said first flap (703) has said tab (706), said second

flap (704) having an edge (705) provided with a border 
member (707).
