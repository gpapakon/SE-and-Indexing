<ABSTRACT>
Cathode ray tube (electron beam tube) (1) with an input cavity resonator (2), through which a radio-frequency control voltage is applied between cathode (15) and grid (17) of the electron tube (1), an annular electrode (ring electrode) (8), which is connected in an electrically conductive way to the grid (17) of the tube, being located opposite a metal wall (9) of the input cavity resonator (2) and being connected to a DC voltage feed line (11). Undesired oscillations (parasitic oscillations) are suppressed in that radio-frequency attenuating material (14) is assigned to the DC voltage feed line (11) on a section of length located near the annular electrode (8).
