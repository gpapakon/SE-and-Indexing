<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a co-extruded, biaxially oriented film which comprises a base layer essentially containing a polypropylene or a polypropylene mixture, and at least one outer layer containing olefinic polymers. The outer layer contains a combination of inorganic and/or organic particles and tertiary aliphatic amine of the formula I

 alkyl radical.
An opaque film according to claim 1, characterised in that the inorganic and/or
organic particles have a mean particle size of 2 to 5 µm.
An opaque film according to claim 1 and/or 2, characterised in that the outer layer
contains 0.05 to 2% by weight of tertiary aliphatic amine of Formula I.
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
R
1
 denotes an unsaturated aliphatic radical with 18 to 30 carbon atoms.
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
R
1
 denotes a saturated alkyl radical having 12 to 18 carbon atoms. 
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the base layer contains 3 to 20% by weight of fillers in relation to the weight of

the base layer.

the base layer contains 10 to 15% by weight of fillers in relation to the weight of

the base layer.
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that
the film contains 5 to 25% by weight of inorganic and/or organic particles and

fillers, the weight indication being related to the total weight of the film.
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that
the filler of the base layer is the same compound as the inorganic and/or organic

particles of the outer layer.
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that
the filler in the base layer is calcium carbonate while the particles in the outer layer

are calcium carbonate.
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that
the outer layer has a thickness of 0.5 to 2 µm.
An opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that
the outer layer is sealable.
Use of a multi-layer film according to one or more of claims 1 to 12 in the
production of in-mould labelling labels. 
A label characterised in that it contains a film according to one or more of claims
1 to 12.
A method of producing an opaque film according to one or more of claims 1 to
