<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing receptacle for machine washing of clothes by means of a detergent 
in the form of tablets which are placed in the interior of the receptacle 

prior to placing the latter in the drum of the washing machine and the washing 
process is started, said receptacle comprising a flexible liquid permeable 

sleeve (2) arranged in an enclosing manner about a comparatively rigid 
hollow body (1) to form an annular chamber (3) between the body and the 

sleeve (2). The body (1) has an inlet opening (5) for inserting a tablet (7) into 
the interior of the body and means for transferring the tablet from the interior 

of the body to the annular chamber (3). The transfer means comprises a 
transfer slot (6) formed in the lateral wall of the tubular body (1). Adjacent 

to the slot (6) a transversal wall (4) is provided in the interior of the tubular 
body (1). The dispensing receptacle according to the invention is easy to use 

and ensures a fast and efficient disintegration of the tablets inserted therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dispensing receptacle for machine washing of 
clothes by means of a detergent in the form of tablets which are placed in the 
interior of the receptacle prior to placing the latter in the drum of the washing 
machine and the washing process is started, said receptacle comprising a 
flexible, fluid permeable sleeve being arranged in an enclosing manner about 
a comparatively rigid hollow body to form an annular chamber between the 
body and the sleeve, said body having an inlet opening for inserting a tablet 
into the interior of the body. DK-B 165.759 discloses a dispensing device of the above type, wherein the 
hollow body having the shape of an essentially tubular body is formed of a 
mouthpiece and a closing part being at their inner ends in releasable engagement 
with each other. When the two parts are brought out of engagement with 
each other, the annular chamber formed between the tubular body and the 
sleeve communicates directly with the inlet opening in the mouthpiece. As a 
result, a tablet may be inserted into the annular chamber, and when the two 
parts are brought into engagement with each other again, the tablet is prevented 
from leaving the annular chamber in its entirety, as said chamber is 
closed. The tablet may then as intended only leave the annular chamber in 
dissolved or pulverized form through the liquid permeable sleeve or through 
openings in the tubular body. This dispensing device thus requires considerable 
handling of the two parts for inserting a tablet into the annular chamber. The object of the invention is to provide a user-friendly dispensing receptacle 
of the type stated above ensuring a fast and efficient dissolution and disinte 
gration of the detergent tablets.  The dispensing receptacle according to the invention is characterised in that 
a transversal wall is arranged the interior of the hollow body and a transfer 
slot is formed adjacent thereto in the lateral wall of the hollow body allowing 
transfer of a tablet from the interior of the hollow body to the annular chamber. Consequently, a tablet may be placed into the annular chamber in an easy 
manner by introducing it through the inlet opening of the body, whereby it 
falls down onto the transversal wall. Depending on the inclination of the 
inclined wall relative to vertical and relative to the adjacent transfer slot 
formed in the lateral wall of the body, the tablet is guided into the annular 
chamber, either on its own or by suitable orientation of the body. When the

A dispensing receptacle for machine washing of clothes by means of a 
detergent in the form of tablets which are placed in the interior of the receptacle 

prior to placing the latter in the drum of the washing machine and the 
washing process, said receptacle comprising a flexible liquid permeable sleeve 

(2,52) placed in an enclosing manner about a comparatively rigid hollow body 
(1,51) to form an annular chamber (3, 53) between the body and the sleeve, 

said body (1,51) having an inlet opening (5) for inserting a tablet (7,57) into 
the interior of the body, characterised in that a transversal wall (4,54) is 

provided in the interior of the hollow body (1,51) and a transfer slot (6,56) 
is formed adjacent thereto in the lateral wall of the hollow body (1,51), said 

slot enabling transfer of a tablet from the interior of the hollow body to the 
annular chamber. 
A receptacle according to claim 1, characterised in that the hollow body 

(1,51) is an essentially tubular body. 
A receptacle according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that when seen 
in direction from the inlet opening (5) to the transfer slot (6,56) the transversal 

wall (4,54) is downwardly inclined in the direction towards the latter. 
A receptacle according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the lateral wall of the hollow body is provided with openings (9). 
A receptacle according to 1 or 3, characterised in that the transversal 
wall (4,54) is provided with openings (8). 
A receptacle according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises a 
closing member (17,30,31,32) intended to close the transfer slot (6,56) for 

 
preventing a tablet (7,57) inserted into the annular chamber (3,53) from 

returning to the interior of the body and thus to the surroundings. 
A receptacle according to claim 6, characterised in that the closing 
member is formed by a slide (17) slidably arranged relative to the body (1) 

between an exposed position and a closed position of the transfer slot (6). 
A receptacle according to claim 7, characterised in that the slide (17) is 
arranged axially displaceable on the inner face of the body (1). 
A receptacle according to claim 6, characterised in that the closing 
member is formed of a flap (30,31,32) hinged to the body, said flap being 

pivotal between a position, in which it extends across the slot (56) and closes 
it and a position, in which the slot (56) is exposed. 
A receptacle according to claim 7, characterised in that the closing 
member (17) is provided with openings (19).
