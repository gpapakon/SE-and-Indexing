<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a heating device (1) with a solid-fuel stove body (4) consisting of a plurality of sheet-metal components (6, 10) and has at least one stoking aperture (15) and an outlet for flue gases, takes the form of a heating module (30) and is made up substantially of two sections (31, 32) consisting of bevelled plate components. Here, one section (32) is U-shaped and the other (31) L-shaped in cross-section. The two arms (37, 38) projecting from the web (36) of the U-shaped section (32) and one arm (33) is U-shaped and of the other section (31) face one another and are arranged in mutually perpendicular planes. The front edges of one section (32) are secured, and especially welded, to the arm (33) of the other section (31). The longer arm (33) of the L-section (31) forms a front wall (34) and its shorter arm (35) a cover plate (16) for the heating module (30), whereas the two arms (37, 38) of the U-section (32) form sidewalls (8, 9) and its web (36) a rear wall (7) of the heating module (30), and the width (39) of the front wall (34) is greater than the outside width (40) of the U-section (32).

Heating device with a stove body composed of several sheet metal components 
with a furnace for solid fuels, which comprises at least one filling opening and an 

outlet for flue gases and is designed as a heating module and is composed 
essentially of two sections formed by flanged sheet steel blanks, of which one 

section has a roughly U-shaped cross section and the other section has an L-shaped 
cross section, wherein the two arms projecting from the bridge of the U-shaped 

section and an arm of the other section face one another and are 
arranged in planes perpe
ndicular to one another, and the bridge of the U-shaped 
section and the additional arm of the L-shaped section are arranged in parallel 

planes and front edges of one section are connected, in particular welded, to the 
arm of the other section, characterised in that the longer arm (33) of the L-shaped 

section (31) forms a front wall (34) and the shorter arm (35) thereof forms a cover 
plate (16) of the heating module (30), whilst the two arms (37, 38) of the U-shaped 

section (32) form side walls (8, 9) and the bridge (36) thereof a rear wall (7) of the 
heating module (30) and a width (39) of the front wall (34) is greater than an 

exterior width (40) of the U-shaped section (32), and in that the L-shaped and/or 
the U-shaped section (31, 32) are designed in one piece. 
Heating device according to claim 1, characterised in that on the shorter arm (35) 
of the L-shaped section (31) an extension is provided which projects over the 

shorter arm (35) parallel to the longer arm (33) in the same direction as the 
former. 
Heating device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that side edges of the 
arms (37, 38) of the U-shaped section (32) and of the bridge (36) rest on the 

facing surfaces of the arms (33, 35) of the L-shaped section (31) and are joined 
together by moulded welds (48).  

 
Heating device according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that on 
the exteriors (43, 44) of the side walls (8, 9) of the heating module (30) coupling 

devices (67) for lining element carriers (68, 93) are arranged. 
Heating device according to claim 4, characterised in that lining element carriers 
(68, 93) are furnished with coupling elements (66) of the coupling device (67) 

diametrically opposed to the heating module (30) and comprise holding devices 
for the lining elements (22, 23) made of different materials, e.g. tiles, sheet metal, 

glass fibre reinforced plastic or the like, whereby preferably the lining elements 
(22, 23) are joined together in longitudinal direction by detachable coupling 

elements or hinge arrangements (91). 
Heating device according to claim 5, characterised in that the lining elements (22, 
23) and the lining element carriers (68, 93) are inserted between a sheet metal 

frame (13) rotating in the region of a base plate (12) and the side walls (8, 9) of 
the heating module (30). 
Heating device according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that in 
the corner region a cut-out (17) is arranged between the short and long arm 

(33,35) of the L-shaped section (31). 
Heating device according to claim 7, characterised in that the sides of the cut-out 
(17) parallel to the side walls (8, 9) and to the rear wall (7) are welded to arms 

(50, 51) of a C-shaped section (20) arranged on the inside of the L-shaped 
section (31). 
Heating device according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the opening of the 
cut-out (17) parallel to the base plate (12) is sealed by a hotplate (19), in 

particular a screwed down cast iron plate.
