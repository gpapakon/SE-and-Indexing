<ABSTRACT>
An acidic cleaning process for aluminum, especially aluminum cans, that includes a pre-cleaning washing stage followed by an acid cleaning stage is improved by including in the pre-cleaning washing solution both of (i) a component of polyalkoxylated straight or branched chain alcohol surfactant and (ii) a component of polyalkylene glycol-abietic acid surfactant, which are maintained during the process in a ratio of component (i) to component (ii) within the range from 0.4:1 to 3.0:1. The method is particularly useful when the acid cleaning stage also contains both these types of surfactants, but at a lower ratio. A pre-cleaner replenisher composition comprising water, sulfuric acid, and polyalkoxylated straight or branched chain alcohol surfactant is advantageously used in the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
After can formation by cold forming, aluminum fines, lubricating oils and 
other contaminants remain on the surface. It is necessary to clean the surface 
thoroughly prior to the further treatment which often includes the application of one 
or more surface coatings. Early cleaning compositions for aluminum surfaces proposed the use of aqueous 
acidic compositions either alone or with added fluoride at temperatures in the 
range of 185 to 200 째 F (85 to 93 째 C). In US-A- 4,009,115 and its 
Re-Issue No. 32,661, the addition of 0.05 to 0.1 grams per liter of 
hydrofluoric acid as a means of reducing the processing temperature to within the 
range of 90 to 135 째 F (32 to 57 째C) is proposed. The compositions 
preferably contain 0.1 to 10 grams per liter of a surfactant which could be anionic, 
cationic or nonionic. US-A-3,969,135 proposes the use 
of an aqueous acidic cleaning composition containing a blend of two surfactants. This 
composition was also suitable for relatively low temperature use and preferably contained 
0.01 to 0.4 weight percent of a fluoride accelerator. The surfactants proposed 
were a polyalkoxylated 
straight chain alcohol and a polyalkylene glycol-abietic acid surfactant. The 
compositions are currently used in one or more, preferably at least two, cleaning 
stages in the commercial production of aluminum cans, but not usually in the first 
stage. Normal current practice is to provide most of the acidity in the precleaning 
stage, immediately before washing the cans with a cleaner composition as taught herein 
, by directing part of the acid cleaner washing solution into the pre-cleaner washing 
solution, which otherwise consists largely of tap water, with optional additions  
 
of acid. When a second stage acid washing solution as taught herein is used in this 
manner, the ratio between the two kinds of surfactants normally will be the same in 
the first stage as in the second, if nothing else is added to the first stage solution, 
inasmuch as no preferential dragout of one type of surfactant has been observed. Washing operations with solutions that include nonionic surfactants are normally 
conducted at or slightly below the cloud point of the washing solution, which 
is the temperature at which the surfactant comes out of or goes into aqueous solution 
with changing temperature. It is a characteristic of most nonionic surfactants, including 
those as noted above, that they become less soluble in water as 
the temperature of an aqueous surfactant composition is raised. At

aluminum cans through 


a) an acidic pre-cleaner washing stage that comprises 
both of (i) a component of polyalkoxylated straight or
