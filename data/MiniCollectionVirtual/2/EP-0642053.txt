<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surveillance assemblies and, in
particular, to surveillance assemblies which are adapted to
accommodate environmental conditions.Surveillance assemblies are known in which the surveillance
assembly comprises a dome-shaped support housing to which is
joined or attached a dome-shaped cover member or "bubble". The
support housing and cover member define an enclosed space for
receiving a camera and lens assembly which views outward of the
surveillance assembly through the cover member. Usually, the
camera and lens assembly is supported in the surveillance
assembly so as to be rotational about a vertical axis for
effecting a panning movement and to be pivotable about a
horizontal axis to effect a tilting movement.When the surveillance assembly is intended to be used in
environments in which there are wide variations in temperature
(as, for example, when it is to be used outdoors), various
additions have been made to the assembly in an attempt to reduce
any adverse effects which might result from the wide temperature
changes. These additions have sought to cool the assembly to
compensate for high environmental temperatures and to heat the
assembly to compensate for low environmental temperatures. In
this way, overheating of the electrical components of the
assembly, fogging within the assembly and/or icing of the dome-shaped
cover member are avoided.A surveillance assembly having such compensation for 
environmental conditions is disclosed in U.S. patent 4,320,949.
In a first embodiment of the surveillance assembly of the '949
patent, a thermostatically controlled fan is disposed in the side
wall of the upper support housing. This fan provides forced air
circulation in the housing to cool the housing when the
temperature in the housing reaches a predetermined level. Also
included in this embodiment of the surveillance assembly are
thermostatically controlled heaters. The latter are brought into
operation when the temperature in the housing approaches freezing
so as to heat the air in the housing.In a second embodiment of the surveillance assembly of the
'949 patent, air is brought into the assembly by natural
circulation. In this embodiment, a space or inlet area is
provided at the interface of the support housing and cover member
so that air can naturally enter the support housing about the
circumference of the housing. This air is circulated downward
adjacent the inner wall of the cover member and then proceeds
upward into the support housing where it is exhausted through an
air
