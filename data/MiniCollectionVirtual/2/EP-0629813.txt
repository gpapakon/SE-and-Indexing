<ABSTRACT>
A sports lighting fixture having improved light delivery 
characteristics includes an elongated bare arc tube, high intensity 

discharge lamp disposed near the apex of a parabolically shaped reflector 
member. The reflector is constructed of a non-metallic material and by 

the orientation and positioning of the lamp within the reflector, an 
essentially oval shaped light pattern is generated. A light transmissive 

cover is disposed over the open end of the reflector. When projected 
onto the playing surface of a sports field, the oval shaped light pattern 

translates to an essentially circular shaped pattern which allows for a 
more uniform and efficient overlapping of the multiple light outputs at the 

playing field level. Louvers can be disposed within the reflector to further 
redirect any high angle light output into a lower angle which is more 

useful at the playing surface level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sports lighting luminaire having low glare 
lighting characteristics. More specifically, this invention relates to such a 
sports lighting luminaire as exhibits improved photometric performance so 
as to achieve a more efficient and uniform light delivery configuration to 
a large area such as a playing surface of a sports field or arena. In the past, when architectural lighting designers were faced with 
the task of uniformly illuminating the playing surface of a sports field while 
minimizing the amount of light spilled into the seating portion of the sports 
field, the individual lighting fixtures at their disposal would be of a type that 
utilized such light delivery techniques as glare shields and louvers. The 
aim of such a designer is to substantially reduce or even eliminate the 
amount of light that extends above the playing surface and into the eyes 
of the spectators and even above the confines of the field so as to 
adversely affect the surrounding homes and/or businesses. It is known 
that though such glare shields and louvers can be effective to direct light 
output in a desired pattern, in doing so, these devices contribute a 
measurable amount of light loss that therefore requires an increased 
amount of light output from the light source. In addition to resulting in 
light loss, a typical sports lighting fixture provides such shield and louver 
devices in an external manner to the reflector portion so as to adversely 
contribute to the wind loading characteristics of such light fixture. An 
example of a light fixture having external glare shield and louver elements 
is found in US Patent No. 4,725,934 issued to Gordon on February 16,  
 
1988. Given that each louver results in a specific amount of light loss and 
that external light directing elements increase wind loading of the fixture, 
it would therefore be advantageous that if further light directing elements 
were needed to direct light output so as to minimize spill light above the 
necessary playing surface, that the number of such devices be minimized 
and that they reside within the reflector configuration rather than on the 
outside thereof. The number of louvers that are needed to redirect light output is 
directly related to how large of an upper light output angle there is relative 
to the longitudinal axis of the reflector of the fixture. The larger the angle 
of light output from the reflector, the greater the amount of louver area is 
needed to redirect such light to the specific location
