<ABSTRACT>
The movement of first and second sliders on a user interface 
of a data processing system is loosely coordinated by 

way of pusher member. The pusher is coupled to one of the 
sliders and extends over to the other slider, where it is 

adapted to contact a side of the other slider. The sliders 
move independently of each other if the pusher does 

not contact the other slider, as in for example, the sliders 
moving apart. If the pusher does contact the other 

slider, then both sliders become ganged and move in unison.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sliders, such as slider 
bars or slider boxes, on graphical user interfaces of data 
processing systems. Sliders are used on visual interfaces, such as computer 
screens. Sliders allow a user to adjust a parameter or 
property on a data processing system. A slider typically 
includes a movable object such as a bar (or a box) that is 
located on a track. The slider bar can be moved along the 
track to adjust the parameter. The track typically represents 
a scale. Thus, any movement of the slider bar can 
be visualized relative to the scale. Sliders frequently operate in isolation so that if plural 
sliders are displayed, movement of one slider bar has no 
affect on the others. When one parameter directly affects 
another parameter, it is desirable to adjust both parameters 
together. In the prior art, this is accomplished by 
providing that the motion of one slider bar controls the 
motion of the other, so that both slider bars can move up 
or down (or right or left) in unison. However, there is no satisfactory manner in which to display 
partial dependencies among plural parameters. For 
example, a first parameter may be partially dependent upon 
a second parameter, wherein if the first parameter drops 
below a certain setting or value, then the second parameter 
will also drop to a lower setting. Thus, if both 
parameters have a scale of 1-10 and the second parameter 
is set to 5, moving the first parameter below 5 results in 
the second parameter being lowered. The setting of the  
 
first parameter is independent of the second parameter, as 
long as the first parameter is 5 or greater. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
method and apparatus for displaying such partial dependencies 
among parameters. It is a further object of the present invention to provide 
a method and apparatus for loosely ganging sliders on a 
user interface of a data processing display. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, 
first and second sliders are displayed on a user interface 
of a data processing system, with the first and second 
sliders each being capable of being moved along a respective 
path. A member that is coupled to the first slider 
is displayed. The member extends toward the path of the 
second slider so as to contact a portion of the second 
slider when one of the sliders moves with respect to the 
other slider in a predetermined direction along the respective 
slider path. In another aspect of the present invention, it is determined 
if

<CLAIMS>
A method of displaying related parameters on a user 
interface of a data processing system, comprising the 

steps of: 

a) displaying first and second sliders, said first 
and second sliders each being capable of being 

moved along a respective path; 
b) displaying a member coupled to said first slider 
and extending toward said path of said second 

slider so as to contact a portion of said second 
slider when one of said sliders moves with respect 

to the other of said sliders in a predetermined 
direction along said respective slider 

path. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps 
of: 


a) determining if either said first slider or said 
second slider is moved along said respective 

slider path; and 
b) determining if said movement causes said second 
slider to contact said member and if so then 

moving both of said first and second sliders 
together. 
The method of claim 2 wherein said step of moving 
both of said first and second sliders together further 

comprises the step of pushing said respective 
nonmoving slider with said member and said respective 

moving slider. 
The method of claim 2 wherein said step of determining 
if said movement causes said second slider to 

contact said member further comprises the step of 
moving said respective moving slider without moving 

said respective nonmoving slider if said second slider 
does not contact said member. 
An apparatus for displaying related parameters on a 
user interface of a data processing system, comprising: 


a) means for displaying first and second sliders, 
said first and second sliders each being capable 

of being moved along a respective path; 
b) means for displaying a member coupled to said 
first slider and extending toward said path of 

said second slider so as to contact a portion of 
said second slider when one of said sliders 

moves with respect to the other of said sliders 
in a predetermined direction along said respective 

slider path. 
The apparatus of claim 5, further comprising: 

a) means for determining if either said first slider 
or said second slider is moved along said 

respective slider path; and 
b) means for determining if said movement causes 
said second slider to contact said member and if 

so then for moving both of said first and second 
sliders together. 
The apparatus of claim 6 wherein said means for determining 
if said movement causes said second slider 

to contact said member and if so then for moving both 
 

of said first and second sliders together further 
comprises means for pushing said respective nonmoving 

slider with said member and said respective moving 
slider. 
The apparatus of claim 6 wherein said means for determining 
if said movement causes said second slider 

to contact said member further comprises means for 
moving said respective moving slider without moving 

said respective nonmoving slider if said second slider 
does not contact said member.
