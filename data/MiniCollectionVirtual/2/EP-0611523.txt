<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a microbial natural enemy of nematodes by utilizing a whole plant body, which comprises making 
plant parasitic nematodes bearing the adherent microbial natural enemy invade a whole plant body, thereby efficiently producing 

an obligate parasite acting as a natural enemy of nematodes in the whole plant body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing an 
absolute parasitic microorganism which is natural enemy to 
plant parasitic nematode which brings about damages to crop 
plants. To avoid damages caused by nematode, it has been common 
to employ a chemical control method or a field husbandly 
control method. From an economical background such that 
profitable crop plants have to be cultivated by continuous 
cropping, a convenient inexpensive chemical control method 
has been widely used. However, in view of a concern about 
environmental pollution due to treatment with large amounts 
of a chemical agent, a study is also being made on a method 
of employing a natural enemy microorganism as one of new 
control methods An attention has been drawn particularly to Pasteuria 
spp. i.e. a group of bacteria which are absolute parasites 
to nematode, since they are parasitic specifically to 
certain specific nematodes and have relatively high 
resistance against heat and chemical substances and thus can  
 
be stored for a long period of time, and thus they are 
highly safe and easy to use. However, it has been extremely 
difficult to parasitize them efficiently on nematode and 
multiply them in a large amount, because they are absolute 
parasites and have no motility. For multiplication of the 
microorganism of this type it has been common to employ a 
method wherein nematode parasitized with such a 
microorganism is inoculated in the vicinity of the soil on 
which a crop plant is cultivated, followed by cultivation 
for a long period of time of at least two months, whereupon 
the multiplied microorganism is recovered from the root. 
However, the method is low in productivity, and is thus 
hardly practicable for actual agricultural production. In 
addition, it is possible that a plant root transformed by 
agrobacterium or a simple root system is aseptically 
cultured on a culture medium such as an agar medium, and 
then nematode parasitized with the microorganism is 
aseptically inoculated thereto and multiplied under a 
controlled environment. However, the productivity is not 
better than the method using the soil. Furthermore, multiplication of plant parasitic nematode 
in the past has been conducted only with the root, and 
naturally the bacterium parasitic to nematode has been 
multiplied only using the plant root. In general, penetration of nematode into a plant is  
 
limited in the vicinity of the growth point of root, and 
thus can limitedly be controlled by the cultivation area, 
plant type, or the
