<ABSTRACT>
A method for the production of lined panels comprising the 
simultaneous coupling and injection molding of the panel support (8) 

with the relevant lining (1) in tape or sheet introduced between two 
half-molds (2,3) of matching shape that are approached as far as a 

preset distance ranging between 70% and 80% of the thickness of the 
lining. The subsequent injection of the thermoplastic material is 

performed at low pressure in more points of the mold by means of 
injectors (7) independently controlled in temperature and flow rate. 
The invention also concerns a device for carrying out the method that 
envisages a dispensing unit (5) of the thermoplastic material positioned 

between the press (6) and a plurality of injectors (7) independently 
controlled in temperature and flow rate, as well as means to keep the 

half-molds (2,3) appropriately spaced during injection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method and a
device for the production of lined panels by means of
low pressure injection.In particular the invention concerns a method and a
device for the production of lined panels wherein a
sheet of lining material is introduced into a mold and
shaped simultaneously with the thermoplastic material
injected at the fluid state and constituting the panel support.Panels of this type find application in the motorcar
sector to obtain inside door coverings, sun screens,
posts covers, back and front shelves and the like, as
well as in the furniture sector to cover furniture, chairs,
complementary items and the like.Methods and processes wherein it is envisaged to
shape a flat lining sheet made of deformable material by
directly introducing it into the mold where a thermoplastic
material is subsequently injected, are already currently
known.In particular the patent application N. Ml
91A000257 corresponding to EP-A-0 497 335, filed by
the same Applicant, concerns a method for the production
of lined panels that envisages the positioning of a
lining made of shapable material inside a mold, the
mold sealing and the subsequent injection of a thermoplastic
material into the mold itself that shapes the lining
and matches therewith to form the finished panel. The
injection is preferably performed in more points of the
mold and at high pressure to allow a more rapid and
homogeneous distribution of the material, moreover
avoiding the premature cooling of the thermoplastic
material getting in contact with the surfaces of the mold
and the lining.The European application N. EP 320925, filed by
BMW AG and Dynamit Nobel AG, concerns a method
for the production of lined panels that envisages the
positioning of a lining made of shapable material, preshaped
or in a flat form, inside a mold. The mold is then
sealingly closed in a way that the subsequent injection
of thermoplastic material and inert gas into a single
point of the mold itself allows the shaping of the lining
and the formation of an internally hollow product.A series of sucking channels are provided that
allow to create depression in the space comprised
between the external surface of the lining and the internal
surface of the mold facing thereto, in order to
improve the adhesion of the lining sheet to the mold surface.
Through a series of channels provided inside the
mold a refrigerating fluid is circulated to allow the rapid
cooling of the thermoplastic material injected and therefore
the improvement of the production rate. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of lined panels, of the
type comprising the steps of positioning a lining (1)

of shapeable material, in tape or sheet, between
two half molds (2,3), injection molding a thermoplastic

material (8) to form the support of said
panel, and cutting the formed panel in correspondence

to its border before its removal from said half
molds, 
characterized in that
 it further comprises the
steps of approaching said half molds (2,3) as far as

a preset distance having a value within the range of
70 % to 80 % of the thickness of the lining material

(1) and injecting said thermoplastic material (8) at a
pressure below 50 bar in more points of the mold

(3) by means of injectors (7) independently controlled
in temperature and flow rate, the sealing

between said half molds (2,3) being performed by
said sheet or tape of lining material (1).
A method according to claim 1, wherein said injection
of thermoplastic material (8) is carried out at a

pressure of about 20 bar.
A device for the production of lined panels by
means of injection of a thermoplastic material (8)

on a lining material (1) in sheet or tape, of the type
comprising a mold formed by two half molds (2,3) of

matching shape, a dispensing unit (5) of said thermoplastic
material (8) to said mold and a plurality of

injectors (7) for the injection of said thermoplastic
material, 
characterized in that
 it further comprises
spacing means (4) adjustable to space said half

molds (2,3) at a preset distance; 
in that
 said injectors
(7) are located at different points of the mold

and independently controlled in flow rate; and 
in
that
 said dispensing unit (5) and said injectors (7)
are independently controlled in temperature.
A device according to claim 3, wherein said spacing
means (4) are adjustable to space the half molds

(2,3) to a distance within the range of 70% to 80%
of the thickness of said lining material (1).
A device according to claim 3 or 4, wherein said
spacing means (4) rest on the opposite half mold

(3) surface to allow feeding of said lining material
(1) during said injection of thermoplastic material

(8).
A device according to any claim 3 to 5, wherein said
half molds are provided with means (10) for their

heating or cooling.
