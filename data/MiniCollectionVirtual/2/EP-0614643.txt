<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In the case of a shower partition having a plurality of sliding-door wings (21), the intention is to achieve accessibility to the mutually facing surfaces of the horizontal profiled rails (13) and the respective crossmembers (10) of the sliding-door wings (21). 2.2 According to the invention, each sliding-door wing (21) is assigned two disengaging arms (14) which are fixed by one end, in a catching but rotatable manner, into an open groove of the respective crossmember (10) of the surrounding frame. The other ends engage in a groove (13) of the profiled rail (11). As a result, each sliding-door wing (21) can be deflected from a sliding position into a cleaning position parallel to and at a distance from the sliding position. At the end region assigned to the respective crossmember (10), each disengaging arm (14) is equipped with a moulded-on cantilever (19). At its free end, the cantilever (19) bears a catch lug. In the sliding position, the latter engages in the groove (12) of the crossmember (10). During the transfer to the cleaning position, the catch lug (20) jumps over a web bounding the groove and bears externally against said web.

A shower partition comprising a sliding door which is formed 
from sliding door leaves which each have a respective enclosing frame 

whose upper and lower frame members are slidably guided in horizontal 
profile rails, characterised by at least one extension arm (14) which is 

associated with each sliding door leaf and which with one end is fixed 
retainingly but rotatably into a groove (12) in the frame member (10) of 

the enclosing frame of the respective sliding door leaf and which with 
the other end engages into a groove (13) in the profile rail (11) so 

that the associated end region of the sliding door leaf is deflectable 
fro the sliding position into a cleaning position which is spaced from 

and parallel thereto. 
A shower partition according to claim 1 characterised in that 
two extension arms (14) which are arranged in an end region are 

associated with each sliding door leaf. 
A shower partition according to claim 1 characterised in that 
formed on the end region of the extension arm (14), which is associated 

with the respective frame member (10), is a cantilever portion (19) 
which at its free end has a retaining projection (20) which in the 

sliding position engages into the groove (12) of the frame member (10) 
and which in the course of transfer of the respective sliding door leaf 

into the cleaning position jumps over a limb defining the groove (12) of 
the frame member (10) and bears against the limb on the outside thereof. 
A shower partition according to claim 1 characterised in that 
an insert portion (18) which is of flat cross-section is fixedly fitted 

into the groove (12) of the frame member (10), which insert portion is 
provided with an opening in which a locking tongue (15) of the extension 

arm is clamped fast.  
 
A shower partition according to claim 1 characterised in that 
at the end region remote from the sliding door leaf the extension arm 

(14) has an upstanding guide projection (16) which engages into a groove 
(13) in the profile rail (11). 
A shower partition according to claim 4 characterised in that 
the opening (17) of the insert portion (18) is of a polygonal and 

preferably quadrangular configuration and that the locking tongue (15) 
engaging therein is of a hexagonal configuration with unequal edge 

lengths. 
A shower partition according to claim 3 characterised in that 
the extension arm (14) and the cantilever portion (19) are in the form 

of a one-piece plastics member.
