<ABSTRACT>
According to the method, the filter (2) is placed in the middle of the confinement space (5, 5a) in such a way that the large faces of the filter (2) are parallel to the axis of centrifugation (3), and bags (1) are placed on either side of the said filter (2) so that they are in contact with the latter.

Method for treatment by centrifuging of a liquid packed
in bags with flexible walls (1) connected by means of a

flexible tube to at least one filter (2) of a
substantially flat shape, according to which the bags (1)

are placed with the filter (2) in a containment space of a
specific shape (5, 5a) which is caused to rotate at high

speed about a specific axis (3) passing through the centre
of said space, characterised in that the filter (2) is

placed in the centre of the containment space (5, 5a) such
that the large faces of the filter (2) are parallel with

the centrifugation axis (3), and the bags (1) are placed
on either side of said filter.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that,
during centrifuging, the lower edge (2a) and the lateral

edges (2b) of the filter are kept positively in a position
constant with respect to the containment space (5, 5a).
Method according to one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that firstly the bags (1) are placed in

said containment space (5, 5a), then the filter (2) is
positioned between the bags (1) such that it is in contact

with a bag (1) with each of its large faces. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3 and according
to which a plurality of filters (2) are treated,

characterised in that the filters (2) are disposed in the
centre of the containment space (5, 5a) in a condition

stacked on one another by their large faces.
Device for putting into effect the method according to
one of the preceding claims, and comprising a centrifuging

support in the form of an upwardly open container (5)
having a vertical central axis (3), capable of being

rotated at high speed about said axis (3), the support(5)
comprising means (7; 9,11; 9,14) of supporting and

positioning at least one filter (2), characterised in that
the filter constitutes with said support a vertical

partition of a generally flat shape, through the median
plane of which the said central axis (3) substantially

passes, subdividing the interior volume of the support
into two compartments (6) intended to contain the bags

(1).
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that the
supporting and positioning means comprise housing means

(8,8a; 11,11a; 14,14a) for at least one filter (2),
defined towards the foot and laterally by a surface (8a;

11a; 14a) whose contour substantially conforms to the
shape of a filter (2). 
Device according to one of claims 5 and 6,
characterised in that the said supporting and positioning

means comprise a solid partition (7) with substantially
parallel faces (7), integral with said support (5), and in

that the housing means are constituted by an aperture (8)
produced in said partition (7), preferably from the upper

edge (7a) of the latter, and whose contour (8a)
substantially conforms to the shape of a filter (2).
Device according to one of claims 5 and 6,
characterised in that said housing means comprise an

insert in the general shape of a clamp (11, 14) which is
capable of accommodating at least one filter (2), and the

internal surface (11a; 14a) of which has a contour
substantially conforming to the shape 
of a filter (2), and
in that means (12, 13) are provided for movably mounting

the insert (11; 14) in the support (5).
Device according to one of claims 5 to 8, characterised
in that said support (5) has an elongate shape, preferably

an ovoid shape, in horizontal cross-section, and in that
the said partition (2,7; 2,9,11; 2,9,14) extends in

accordance with the small dimension of this horizontal
cross-section.
Device according to one of claims 5 to 9,
characterised in that each compartment (6) is shaped and 

dimensioned such that one single bag (1) or assembly of
bags disposed inside the latter is in contact with all the

partitions (5a,2,7; 9,11; 9,14)of said compartment (6)
