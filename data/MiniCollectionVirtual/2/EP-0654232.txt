<ABSTRACT>
A toothbrush having a block head with bristles embedded in 
tuft holes by flat bars, a block handle for holding said toothbrush, 

and an elongated neck portion connecting said block head with said 
block handle, wherein said block head is at least 3 mm but at most 

4 mm in thickness, the length from the bottoms of said tuft holes to 
a reverse surface of said block head is at least 0.2 mm but at most 

2.2 mm, said tuft holes are 1.8 mm or more in depth and said 
toothbrush is formed of a polyacetal resin. 
Since a polyacetal resin is used as a material of a handle, 
a block head of a toothbrush is not broken or cracked even if a 

thickness of the block head is decreased. Resiliency of the 
material has made the use of the toothbrush in the mouth more 

convenient, provided good handleability in brushing, and improved 
the effect of cleaning the mouth. Owing to high mechanical 

strength, the handle is hardly broken or destroyed, and safety is 
secured. Owing to excellent chemical resistance, the material is 

not deteriorated by a flavor in a dentifrice or the like. Moreover, 
heat sterilization is possible, which is hygienically desirable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a toothbrush, and more
specifically it relates to a toothbrush formed of a polyacetal
resin, having a thin block head, excelling in mechanical strength,
fatigue strength and durability and having good oral handleability.With increasing interest in oral hygiene in recent years,
a toothbrush has been required which is so excellent in oral
handleability as to be able to thoroughly clean the inside of the
mouth including portions that have been so far hardly brushed, such
as insides of molars, etc. in particular. To meet this requirement,
such a tendency has been predominant that a block head is rendered
thinner and smaller in a designing idea of a toothbrush as well.In producing the toothbrush, a method of embedding bristles
which is one of the important steps, i.e., a method of fixing plural
filaments in tuft holes to form tufts, includes a method using flat
bars, a method of embedding the filaments with a resin, and so
forth. Of these, the method using flat bars has been widely 
employed because the embedding operation is simple, the tufts can
surely be fixed, and so forth. The flat bars here referred to are
bar-like or nearly rectangular metallic members which are made of
a harder metal than a material of a toothbrush handle and have a
size being a bit larger than a diameter of the tuft holes. The
method using such flat bars is a method in which the plural
filaments being embedded are bent into two, and the flat bars are
placed into the bent portions and fixed by being inserted into the
tuft holes together with the filaments by a strong force, thereby
fixing the bundle of the filaments in the tuft holes. Since such
step is employed, scar given when inserting the flat bars remains
in walls of the tuft holes. The scar is considered to cause
breakage of the block head in the toothbrush in the embedding step
or breakage of the block head during brushing.For this reason, if the thickness of the block head is
forcibly decreased, there is a likelihood that problems occur, such
as breakage of the block head in embedding, breakage of the block
head during brushing due to fatigue of the material in long-term
use, and the like. When the toothbrush is broken during brushing,
fingers or the oral cavity seems likely to be damaged; it is thus
dangerous. Moreover, when the block head is cracked and split in
embedding, decrease in yield of the product is undesirably invited.
Consequently, in selecting the material of the toothbrush and
designing the shape of the block head, especially the
