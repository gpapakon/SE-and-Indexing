<ABSTRACT>
The sea hare 
Dolabella
auricularia
 has yielded many 
structurally distinct peptides which possess 

antineoplastic activity. Presently the compound 
denominated "dolastatin 10" represents the most 

important of such peptides because of its 
demonstrated potential as an anticancer drug. 
The present invention relates to the systematic 
creation of five unique pentapeptides by selectively 

coupling a tripeptide - trifluoro-acetate salt with 
a preselected dipeptide-trifluoroacetate salt which 

provide active molecules capable of emulating the 
measured therapeutic effect of dolastatin 10. The 

pentapeptides hereof have the structure shown below: 

wherein R is selected from the following group of 
substituents:

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
anti-neoplastic compounds, and more particularly to 
the elucidation and synthesis of selected 
pentapeptides prepared by coupling dipeptide salts 
with the known tripeptide-trifluoroacetate salt. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to 
the synthesis of five pentapeptides by the coupling 
of a tripeptide-trifluoroacetate salt with the 
respective dipeptide-trifluoroacetate salt, which was 
itself prepared by the coupling of dolaproine with 
the respective amino acid. This coupling results in 
compounds which are found to exhibit effective 
antineoplastic activity against various human 
cancerous tumor cell lines. Ancient marine invertebrate species of the Phyla 
Bryozoa, Molluska, and Porifera have been well 
established in the oceans for over one billion years. 
Such organisms have undergone trillions of 
biosynthetic reactions in their evolutionary 
chemistry to reach their present level of cellular 
organization, regulation and defense. For example, marine sponges have changed minimally in 
physical appearance for nearly 500 million years. 
This suggests a very effective chemical resistance to 
evolution in response to changing environmental 
conditions over that period of time. Recognition of 
the potential for utilizing this biologically potent 
marine animal for medicinal purposes was recorded in 
Egypt about 2,700 BC and by 200 BC sea hare extracts  
 
were being used in Greece for their curative affect. 
This consideration along with the observation that 
marine animals, e.g. invertebrates and sharks, rarely 
develop cancer led to the systematic investigation of 
marine animal and plant anticancer compounds. By 1968 ample evidence had been obtained, based on 
the U.S. National Cancer Institute's (NCI) key 
experimental cancer study systems, that certain 
marine organisms could provide new and antineoplastic 
and/or cytotoxic agents and might also lead to 
compounds which would be effective in the control 
and/or eradication of viral diseases. Further, these marine organisms were believed to 
possess potentially useful drug candidates of 
unprecedented structure which had eluded discovery by 
other methods of medicinal chemistry. Fortunately, 
these expectations have been realized, e.g. the 
discovery of the bryostatins, dolastatins and 
cephalostatins, many of which are now in preclinical 
development or human clinical studies. Those researchers presently involved in medicinal 
chemistry know well the time lag between the 
isolation
