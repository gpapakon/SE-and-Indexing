<ABSTRACT>
A drawer mechanism for enabling a drawer to slide 
into and out of a cabinet has guide rails 2 to be fixed 

to wall surfaces of the cabinet to guide movement of 
the drawer, sliders 5 adapted to move along the guide 

rails; and drawer support members 7 on both sides of 
the drawer and moving forward and rearward along with 

the sliders as the drawer is opened or closed. The 
guide rails 2, sliders 5 and support members 7 include 

gravitational locking means such that in the closed 
configuration of the drawer the weight of the drawer 

acts constantly to exert a force maintaining this 
closed configuration. The locking means includes 

sloping parts 2a, 7a on the relevant guide surfaces and 
rollers 4 on the sliders 5, the rollers resting between 

the sloping surfaces when the door is closed. This 
system dispenses with magnetic seals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
device for opening and/or closing a drawer such as a
vegetable box of a refrigerator.Generally, a vegetable box 6 is formed in the
lower part of the main body 1a of a conventional
refrigerator, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. A user may
open and close the vegetable box 6 using a door 3a of
the vegetable compartment in the manner of a drawer.When the user pushes the door 3a of the vegetable
compartment into the main body 1a of the refrigerator,
an attraction is produced between a magnetic material
attached to a door gasket (not shown) and an iron
plate. Accordingly, the door 3a of the vegetable
compartment is attached to the main body 1a of the
refrigerator, so that the heat insulation is maintained
between the magnetic material attached to the door
gasket and the iron plate. A magnetic seal is shown,
for instance, in CH-A-665472.However, the magnetic force of the door gasket
tends to weaken after a long period of use, so that the
door 3a of the vegetable compartment is no longer
satisfactory sealed to the main body 1a of the
refrigerator. This means that cool air leaks outside
the main body 1a of the refrigerator. As a result, the
conventional refrigerator has the disadvantages of a
loss of power in the refrigerator and a drop in
efficiency.The object of the present invention is to overcome
the problems and disadvantages of the conventional
device, that is, to provide a mechanism for opening and
closing a vegetable box of a refrigerator to or from
which a user can easily place or get food such as
vegetables and fruit without the seal being subject to
deterioration over time. According to the invention there is provided a
drawer mechanism for enabling a drawer to slide into
and out of a cabinet, comprising: guide rails to be
fixed to wall surfaces of the cabinet to guide movement
of the drawer; sliders having rollers adapted to move
along the guide rails; and drawer support members on
both sides of the drawer and moving forward and
rearward along with the sliders as the drawer is opened
or closed; wherein the guide rails, sliders, rollers
and support members are so arranged that in the closed
configuration of the drawer the weight of the drawer
acts constantly to exert a force maintaining this
closed configuration, by virtue of the device including
on the one hand upward projections of the guide
rails at their front ends and the rollers on
the front of the sliders, and on the other hand an
upwardly projecting portion and a slanting surface
at the front end of the

<CLAIMS>
A drawer mechanism for enabling a drawer to
slide into and out of a cabinet, comprising:


guide rails (2) to be fixed to wall surfaces of
the cabinet to guide movement of the drawer;
sliders (5) adapted to move along the guide rails,
each having near its front end a roller (4) running on

the respective guide rail (2); and
drawer support members (7) on both sides of the
drawer and moving forward and rearward along with the

sliders as the drawer is opened or closed;
wherein the guide rails (2), sliders (5) and
support members (7) include gravitational locking means

(2a, 4, 7a) such that in the closed configuration of
the drawer the weight of the drawer acts constantly to

exert a force maintaining this closed configuration;
characterised in that the gravitational locking
means includes on the one hand upward projections (2a)

of the guide rails (2) at their front ends and the
rollers (4) on the front of the sliders, and on the

other hand an upwardly projecting portion and a
slanting surface (7a) at the front end of the movement

surface of each support member (7), corresponding to
the projections (2a) of the guide rails, in such a way

that in the closed position the weight of the drawer is
transmitted obliquely from the slanting surface of the

support member (7) through the roller (4) to
slanting surfaces of the upward projections (2a) of the guide rails (2), thus exerting

a closing force on the drawer as aforesaid.
A mechanism according to claim 1, in which
the drawer has a front panel (3) which in the closed

position abuts against the cabinet via a seal (10), and
in which the supporting members (7) in the upper part

of their forward ends have stops (9) for pushing the
sliders (5) inwards when the drawer is closed.
A refrigerator cabinet including a drawer
mounted on a mechanism as claimed in any preceding

claim.
