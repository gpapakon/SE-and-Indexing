<ABSTRACT>
Piston/cylinder arrangement as a drive, in particular for welding devices, consisting of two cylinder spaces (31, 9, 12) which are arranged concentrically to one another and in which a piston (6) and a preliminary piston (10) are displaceably guided. An overflow valve (10, 15, 21, 27) is opened as a function of the position of the preliminary piston (10), so that a pressure medium can flow from the inner admission-pressure space (9, 12) allocated to the preliminary piston (10) into the outer main-pressure space (31) allocated to the piston (6), the overflow valve (10, 15, 21, 27) being formed concentrically to the preliminary piston (10) inside the same.
