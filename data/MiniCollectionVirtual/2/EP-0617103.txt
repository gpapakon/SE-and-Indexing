<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous dispersions comprising a polyurethane and from 5 to 60% by weight, based on the polyurethane, of a polymer which improves the adhesion, the polyurethane being composed essentially of     (a) organic polyisocyanates (b) dihydroxy compounds having a molecular weight of more than 500 to 5000 g/mol, which contain no ionic groups or groups which can be converted into ionic groups (c) compounds having at least one functional group which is reactive towards isocyanate, and at least one group which is ionic or can be converted into an ionic group (d) if desired, compounds which are different from (c), contain at least two functional groups which are reactive towards isocyanate, and have a molecular weight of from 60 to 500 g/mol and the polyurethane or its prepolymer is prepared in a water-miscible solvent and, after addition of the polymer which improves the adhesion, is dispersed in water and, in the case of the prepolymer, is then reacted further to form the polyurethane, characterised in that the polymer which improves the adhesion is a condensation product of a compound (I) selected from aromatic compounds having one aromatic ring, two condensed aromatic rings or two aromatic rings which are linked by a C1-C8-alkylene group, which on at least one ring are substituted by at least one hydroxyl group and, on the aromatic rings, if desired, by from 1 to 3 C1-C12-alkyl or C1-C12-alkoxy groups, or mixtures of these compounds, with a compound (II) selected from compounds having 2 to 20 carbon atoms and at least one keto or aldehyde group, a C4 to C16-diolefin, compounds having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one triple bond, mixtures thereof or mixtures thereof with formaldehyde, not more than 70 mol % of the compound (II) comprising formaldehyde.

An aqueous dispersion containing a polyurethane 
and from 5 to 60% by weight, based on the polyurethane, 

of an adhesion-improving polymer, the polyurethane 
essentially comprising 


(a) organic polyisocyanates, 
(b) dihydroxy compounds which have a molecular weight of 
from more than 500 to 5,000 g/mol and contain no 

ionic groups or groups convertible into ionic 
groups, 
(c) compounds having at least one functional group 
reactive toward isocyanate and at least one ionic 

group or group convertible into an ionic group and 
(d) if required, compounds which differ from (c) and 
have at least two functional groups reactive toward 

ioscyanate and a molecular weight of from 60 to 
500 g/mol, 
 
and the polyurethane or the prepolymer thereof being 

dispersed in water after the addition of the adhesion-improving 
polymer and, in the case of the prepolymer, the 

further conversion to the polyurethane then being effected, 
wherein the adhesion-improving polymer is a reaction 

product of a compound (I), selected from aromatic compounds 
having one aromatic ring, two fused aromatic rings 

or two aromatic rings bonded by a C

-C
8
-alkylene group, 
which are substituted in at least one ring by at least 

one hydroxyl group and may be substituted in the aromatic 
rings by from 1 to 3 C
1
-C
12
-alkyl or C
1
-C
12
-alkoxy groups, 
or mixtures of these compounds with a compound (II) 

selected from compounds having 2 to 20 carbon atoms and 
at least one keto or aldehyde group, a C

-diolefin,  
 

compounds having 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one 
triple bond, mixtures thereof or mixtures thereof with 

formaldehyde, not more than 70 mol % of the compound (II) 
being formaldehyde. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein compound I is α- or β-naphthol, bisphenol A or 

phenol which is unsubstituted or substituted by from 1 to 
3 C

-C
12
-alkyl or alkoxy groups. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein compound II is a compound having 2 to 14 carbon 

atoms and an aldehyde or keto group, a C

-diolefin, 
acetylene, a mixture thereof or a mixture thereof with 

formaldehyde, not more than 70 mol % of the compound (II) 
being formaldehyde. 
An aqueous dispersion as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 3, additionally containing from 0.1 to 20% by 

weight, based on the polyurethane, of a water-emulsifiable 
isocyanate curing agent, wherein the curing 

agent has an isocyanate functionality of at least 2.0 and 
an isocyanate content of at least 10% by weight. 
A process for the preparation of an aqueous 
dispersion as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polyurethane 

or the prepolymer thereof is prepared in a 
water-miscible solvent boiling below 100°C and, after the 

addition of the adhesion-improving polymer, is dispersed 
in water, and, in the case of the prepolymer, the further 

conversion to the polyurethane is then carried out. 
Use of a dispersion as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 4 as an adhesive. 
An adhesive coating obtainable by using a dispersion 
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4.
