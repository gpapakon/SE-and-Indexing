<ABSTRACT>
A method for inhibiting in a mammal the accelerated growth of a solid primary or metastatic tumor resulting from tissue trauma caused surgically, non-surgically, or by tissue ulceration, which method comprises the step of administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of somatostatin or a somatostatin agonist.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a therapeutic method for
inhibiting tumor growth.Cytoreductive surgery has been used as adjuvant
treatment for cancer patients whose tumor is believed to
be too extensive for cure by either drugs or surgery
alone. Accelerated growth of metastases following
surgical excision or debulking of a primary tumor is a
recognized clinical problem, and has been noted, in
particular, in osteogenic sarcoma and testicular cancer.The phenomenon of accelerated growth of metastases
has been attributed to release of viable cells resulting
from the manipulation of the tumor during surgery, or to
acceleration of growth of metastases which originates
before surgery on the tumor occurred. Accelerated growth
of pre-surgical metastases has been attributed to changes
in the immune status of the host secondary to removal of
a major portion of the tumor or to other direct or
indirect effects of the surgical procedure. It has been
postulated that microscopic tumor remaining after surgery
is able to grow more rapidly than is the primary tumor
because the former is not subjected to factors
restricting its growth, e.g., anatomical boundaries,
anoxia, and nutritional deficiencies.Enhanced growth of metastases following partial
excision of implanted tumors in mice was first reported
by Marie and Clunet in 1910, and by Tyzzer in 1913.
These workers stated that partial removal of implanted
tumors made available larger supplies of some "nutritive
substances" to enhance the growth of metastases. This
theory was a modification of Ehrlich's hypothesis that an 
actively growing tumor removed certain specific growth
substances from a host animal.More recently, Simpson-Herren et al. [Cancer
Treat. Rep. 60:1749 (1976)] described a study in which a
surgical procedure which was designed to simulate tumor
excision but which left both the primary tumor and its
spontaneous metastases undisturbed (a sham procedure)
resulted in a slight increase in the thymidine index of
Lewis lung tumor pulmonary metastases, and a decrease in
the animals' life-spans.Other investigators have reported similar enhanced
growth of metastases as a result of surgical or non-surgical
trauma or stress. Of particular note, Fisher et
al. [Cancer Res. 49:1996 (1989)] evaluated the effect of
removal of a primary tumor on the kinetics of cells in
the metastasis of six different tumors. They found an
increase in the labelling index of distant tumor focus
(metastasis) associated with the removal of each of the
tumor types. Serum, obtained from mice
