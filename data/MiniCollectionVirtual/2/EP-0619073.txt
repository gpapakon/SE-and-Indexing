<ABSTRACT>
The pourability of pesticide-containing solid 
microcapsules suspended in a water-based carrier is 

enhanced by the presence of an effective amount of a 
solubilized potassium polyphosphate salt, such as 

tetrapotassium pyrophosphate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to microencapsulated 
pesticidal compositions for agricultural 
use and more particularly relates to water-based 
herbicidal formulations with improved pourability, 
excellent compatibility with standard sprayable fluid 
fertilizers, and reduced antagonism in mixtures of other 
herbicides, especially glyphosate. Agricultural chemicals, particularly herbicides, 
are sold and delivered to applicators in a wide variety 
of formulations, including solid formulations, such as 
powders, dusts and granules and time-release microcapsules, 
liquid formulations, such as solutions and 
emulsions, and suspensions of solids in liquid carriers. 
The choice of which type of selected formulation is 
generally governed by many considerations, such as the 
physical characteristics of the active ingredients, the 
crop or weed species to which the formulation is to be 
applied, and whether the application is better made 
postemergence or preemergence. Delayed-release formulations are chosen to 
provide pesticidal efficacy over an extended period of 
time. Microencapsulation of the pesticide is a delivery 
form often selected for providing the desired delayed-release. 
Applying microencapsulated pesticides in solid 
formulations has several drawbacks in terms of 
convenience of handling and distributing the same in an  
 
environmentally acceptable way, particularly in bulk 
quantities. In recent times it has been found to be 
advantageous from handling and distributing standpoints 
to formulate microencapsulated pesticides in water 
suspensions. Another advantage of formulating pesticide 
containing microcapsulates is the ability to produce a 
product package containing a plurality of pesticides, 
wherein antagonistic action between the pesticides is 
reduced by means of the capsule shell. In such mixtures the effectiveness of the 
plurality of the herbicides is attained at different 
time frames after application. Unfortunately, water-based 
pesticidal formulations containing a high loading 
of pesticide-containing microcapsules and an effective 
suspension system have relatively high viscosities and 
are retained to an undesirable extent on the container 
walls from which the formulation is being drained or has 
been drained. One can reduce the viscosities and the 
retention of the formulation by simply adding more water 
to the formulation. However, the addition of water 
tends to destabilize an otherwise stable formulation and 
obviously reduces its loading of the pesticide in the 
containe
