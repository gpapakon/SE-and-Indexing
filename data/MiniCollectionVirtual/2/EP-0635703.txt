in the strain generating region (55), and the displacement sensor (S) 
includes a fixed rigid component (10), a movable rigid components (11) forming

opposite ends to the fixed and movable rigid components (10, 11), respectively, 

so as to extend between the fixed and movable rigid components (10, 11), and a 
displacement detecting element (23) mounted on the elongated beam member (20)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a weighing cell suited particularly
for use in association with a weight checker and/or a combinational weighing
apparatus, which cell is equipped with a displacement sensor designed to detect
a vibratory component such as, for example, floor vibration, and also to a weighing
apparatus utilizing such weighing cell equipped with the displacement sensor.It is well known that a so-called floor vibration, that is, a low frequency
vibration, harmful to a weighing cell (a load detector) is often generated at
the site where there is installed a weighing apparatus such as, for example, a
weight checker operable to detect the individual weight of articles being transported
by means of a conveyor and/or a combinational weighing apparatus operable to
measure a target weight by means of a combinational calculation of respective
weights of articles detected by a plurality of weighing devices. This floor vibration
causes the weighing cell to give rise to an erroneous weight measurement,
and therefore, the error in weight measurement that is brought about by the floor
vibration has to be compensated for in order to secure a correct result of weight
measurement.For this purpose, this type of weighing apparatus employs not only
one or more weighing cells operable to provide a weight signal proportional to the
weight of an article to be weighed. but also a displacement sensor mounted on the
same base on which the weighing cell or cells are installed, so that an output
signal outputted from the displacement sensor and subsequently inverted may be
summed together with the weight signal to remove an undesirable signal
component representative of a vibration of the base from the weight signal (See
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 3-233327, published October 17,1991,
EP-A-0 129 249 or EP-A-0 122 796). It has however been found that, since the position of the
displacement sensor on the base and the position of the weighing cell on the same
base are necessarily offset relative to each other, there is a problem in that an
accurate detection by the displacement sensor of a vibration acting on the
weighing cell through the base is not ensured.The present invention has been devised with a view to substantially
eliminating the above discussed problems and is intended to provide a combined
weighing and displacement sensor of a type in which a weighing cell and a
displacement sensor designed to detect a vibratory component such as, for
example, floor vibration acting on the weighing cell are
