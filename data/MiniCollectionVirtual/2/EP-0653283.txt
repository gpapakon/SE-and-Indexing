<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a heated assembly according to the prior art portion of claim 1.
Such an
arrangement is used in an injection molding machine,
especially in an injection molding machine of the hot runner
type, particularly useful in securing a heater element in a
desired position around a nozzle body for feeding liquified
plastic to an injection gate of a mold cavity.To maintain the fluidity of the resident plastic
material during closure of the injection gate, enabling its
use in a following molding cycle, it is desirable to form a
terminal part of the sprue channel as an axial bore of a
nozzle of good thermal conductivity closely surrounded by an
electrical heating element. Some nozzle manufacturers go
through costly processes to integrate heaters into the
nozzle body. The primary disadvantage with this approach
however is that should the heater get damaged the nozzle is
lost as well. Thus, it is preferred that the heating
element be removably mounted onto the nozzle body for ready
replacement. One of the primary challenges associated with
this technique is holding the heating element firmly against
the external surface of the hot runner nozzle housing so as
to maximize heater performance.To obtain effective and efficient heat transfer from
the heater to the heated part, it is necessary to have close
contact between them. This is generally accomplished by use 
of a clamping device such as a metal shroud which
encompasses the heater body and is screwed together at its
ends to draw the heater tighter against the nozzle to be
heated. This method has an advantage of being simple, using
common tools such as a screw driver to tighten or loosen the
heater. However, in cases where the heater must be
installed in a confined area it can be difficult to access
the screw head for tightening purposes once it is in its
correct orientation in the molding machine. Typically, the
obstruction is the mold plate adjacent to and surrounding
the heater. In such cases, additional clearance is often
machined into the plate to permit the tightening tool to
reach the screw head.In situations where it is prohibitive to add clearance
machining because it will compromise the strength of the
mold plate or reduce the plate material available to back-up
and support other mold components, a design as shown in U.S.
Patent No. 4,968,247, issued November 6, 1990, permits
tightening of the heater by way of a cam actuated clamp
housing. This design permits a tool to approach from the
axial direction of the heater, thus

<CLAIMS>
A heated assembly for use in plastic molding, including:
a channel means (14,72) or nozzle assembly (26,70) for

transferring molten plastic; an electrically activated
band heater (50) having an outside diameter around at

least a portion of said channel means (14,72) or nozzle
assembly (26,70) for heating said channel means or

nozzle assembly and molten plastic, and including means
placing continuous pressure on said heater (50) to urge

said heater towards said channel means or nozzle
assembly,

characterised in that

said continuous pressure means (56,86,60,80,81)

continuous pressure means is in the form of a separate
sheet-like material strip (56,86), a bar (80) or a rod

(81) adjacent said heater (50) and wherein the
continuous pressure means is formed with a diameter less

than the outside diameter of said heater and such that
said continuous pressure means places continuous

pressure on said heater.
Assembly according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the continuous
pressure means is at least one of the outside (53) and

inside wall (51) of the heater (50).
Assembly according to one of the claims 1 to 3 wherein the
continuous pressure means includes strengthening ribs (85). 
Assembly according to one of the claims 1 to 4 wherein
said channel means is at least one of an injection nozzle

(70) and a hot runner channel (72).
Assembly according to one of the claims 1 to 5, wherein
the heater (50) has an inside surface (51) and an outside

surface (53), wherein the continuous pressure means
engages the outside surface, surrounds at least a

portion thereof, places the heater under continuous
tension and presses the heater towards the channel

means, said heater and continuous pressure means
preferably having an annular shape.
Assembly according to one of the claims 1 to 6 wherein
said continuous pressure means being a metal spring clip

(56), preferably of high carbon steel.
Assembly according to claim 7 wherein said clip (56) is
0.1 - 4 mm thick and said heater is 0.1 - 20 mm thick, and

the heater (50) is thicker than the clip (56).
Assembly according to claim 7 or 8 wherein the heater
(50) includes leads (62) extending therefrom and the

continuous pressure means (56) includes end portions
(58,60) spaced from each other to form a gap (59) with the

leads extending through the gap.
