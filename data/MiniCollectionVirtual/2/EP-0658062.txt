<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for pooling service circuits (16,18) so that they become 
available to a plurality of switching systems (12,14) in a telecommunications 

network includes a regional control node (1) which receives a request for a service 
circuit to be connected to a call (e.g., 10). The regional control node maintains the 

availability status of the service circuits in a pool for the region. In response to a 
request for a service circuit, the regional control node selects an appropriate circuit 

(16,18) and transmits orders to the switches and the circuit to establish the proper 
connections among these units in order to associate the service circuit with the 

requesting call. Advantageously, such an arrangement permits a large pool of 
individually expensive service circuits to serve a large number of switching systems, 

thus, increasing the efficiency of utilization of these service circuits. The 
arrangement is also used for controlling the allocation of transmission resources to 

any call, thus optimizing the use of the regional transmission resources.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to arrangements for pooling and allocating service 
circuits to telecommunication calls, especially those calls requiring service circuits 
which are not available at the switches used in the primary connections. As telecommunication services become increasingly complex, they 
frequently require the use of one or more auxiliary service circuits. Examples of 
such service circuits are conference bridges for voice, for video, broadcast bridges 
for one-way video, for facsimile, or control circuits and data links for accessing 
value added servers for network based services using layers 4-7 of the International 
Standards Organization (ISO) protocol stack; the latter would include access to 
Library of Congress data, electronic newspapers, shop at home networks, etc. In the 
past, this type of situation has not been a problem since the service circuits were 
sufficiently inexpensive that a group of such circuits adequate to serve the needs of a 
switching system were normally provided in that switching system. However, some 
of the service circuits discussed are quite expensive (for example, High Definition 
Television (HDTV), video conference bridges) so that it is necessary to have 
especially efficient use of such circuits, an efficiency usually obtainable only through 
the use of large groups of these circuits. Individual switches cannot use such large 
groups economically. More generally, the allocation of transmission resources 
(bandwidth, individual trunks) even for calls not requiring the use of specialized 
expensive service circuits is not optimum in prior art telecommunications networks. In accordance with the principles of our invention, service circuits are 
available to a group of switching systems through a mechanism which offers a 
centralized control of the allocation of these service circuits. In one specific 
embodiment of the invention, a regional master allocator and control, known as a 
Regional Control Node (RCN), receives requests for these service circuits and 
allocates individual service circuits to the requesting calls for all calls in that region 
comprising a plurality of switching systems. The RCN relies on a topology manager 
and a resource manager to select an available service circuit. The resource manager 
is informed when a service circuit becomes available, initially when the circuit is 
placed in service, thereafter because of a completion of a communication or because 
the service circuit is no longer needed in a particular communication, and
