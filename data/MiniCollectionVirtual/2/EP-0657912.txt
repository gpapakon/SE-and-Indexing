<ABSTRACT>
A process for connecting a molybdenum foil to a lead portion with 
sufficient strength and reliability in which an expensive binder, such as 

platinum, platinum clad molybdenum or the like, is not used. According 
to the invention, a carbon containing or coated molybdenum part is placed 

between the molybdenum foil and the molybdenum lead portion and then 
resistance welding the two to one another. Furthermore a hermetically 

enclosed part of a lamp can be produced by this process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for connecting a molybdenum foil
to a molybdenum lead portion. The invention furthermore relates to a
production process for producing a hermetically enclosed part of a lamp
using the resultant connected foil and lead part.Conventionally, quartz glass is often used as lamp material;
however, it has a coefficient of expansion significantly different from that
of the tungsten or molybdenum of which the lead pin is normally made.
Therefore, to form a hermetically enclosed part, a direct hermetic
enclosure of the quartz glass on the lead pin is not used, and instead, a
welding of the lead pin to a molybdenum foil is performed. In this
way, an electrical connection can be maintained inside and outside of the
lamp. Fig. 5 illustrates a hermetically enclosed part of a conventional
filament lamp. In the representation, numeral 1 references a bulb made of
quartz glass; on an end, a hermetically enclosed part 11 is formed in which
molybdenum foil 4 is placed. An inner lead 3 is connected to filament 2
and the inner lead 3 and an outer lead 5 both resistance welded to
molybdenum foil 4 for providing an electrical connection enabling an
external source of power to be applied to the filament. Tungsten or
molybdenum is used for these leads.The molybdenum foil 4 is resistance welded to an end 31 of inner
lead 3 and an end 51 of the outer lead 5 with either platinum of a relatively
low melting point or molybdenum with platinum coating (platinum clad
molybdenum) being disposed therebetween as a binder 7. In this binder 7,
for example, the platinum clad molybdenum is formed such that a
molybdenum foil 71 is coated with a platinum film 72 as shown in Fig. 6.
Molybdenum foil 71 has, for example, a thickness of 28 microns, and the
platinum film 72 has a thickness of 1 micron.When, in this case, the leads and the molybdenum foil are
temporarily welded directly to one another, as a result of their temperature
increases, oxidation and nitration occur, and mechanical strength decreases
even if welding is achieved. In particular, in the molybdenum foil, due to
a small tensile force, holes can be formed since its temperature rises
slightly due to its small thickness.The molybdenum and the tungsten which comprise the leads are
formed as pins of sintered metals and consist of fine crystal grains which
adhere to one another when they are exposed to a high temperature. This
phenomenon is usually called recrystallization, by which the lead pins
consisting of the fine crystal grains change into lead
