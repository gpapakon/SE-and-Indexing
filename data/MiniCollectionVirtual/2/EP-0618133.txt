<ABSTRACT>
The thermal protection device is formed by a plurality of juxtaposed elemental modules, each including a fairing (streamlining) element (20) fitted with fastening tabs (30) and with a thermal insulation integrated with the fairing element. The gap between neighbouring fairing elements is limited to the minimum value necessary for taking up their thermal expansions. The connection means (40) which releasably join the fastening tabs to a primary structure to be protected comprise a ball joint (44) fixed adjustably to the fastening tab and capable of being locked inside a corresponding housing of a reception part (60) fixed to the primary structure. The ball joint (44) is locked in its housing by means of a finger which can be released by an action exerted against an elastic return force (80).

A thermal protection device, in particular for an aircraft or a 
space vehicle, the device comprising a plurality of juxtaposed unit modules 

(10) each comprising a fairing element (20; 320) provided with fixing tabs 
(30; 330), a thermal insulator (16) integrated in the fairing element, and rigid 

connection means (40; 340) for releasably connecting the fixing tabs to a 
primary structure that is to be protected (12),
 
the device being characterized in that the gap between neighboring fairing 

elements (20; 320) is limited to a value substantially equal to the minimum 
value necessary for accommodating thermal expansion of the fairing 

elements, and the rigid connection means for connecting a fixing tab (30; 
330) of a module to the primary structure comprise a ball (44; 144;
 244) 
fixed to the fixing tab in adjustable manner and capable of being locked 

inside a corresponding socket (62; 162; 262) of a retaining part (60; 160; 
260) fixed to the primary structure (12), the ball (44; 144; 244) being locked 

in its socket by means of a finger (70; 170; 270) capable of being released 
by action exerted against a resilient return force. 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that the locking 
finger (70; 170; 270) is movable in a direction substantially perpendicular to 

the direction of the resilient return force, which force acts on a part (76; 176; 
276) having a face that forms a self-locking ramp against which the locking 

finger bears. 
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that the locking 
finger (70) is released by applying traction on said part (76) from outside the 

thermal protection device through a gap between neighboring unit modules. 
The device according to claim 3, characterized in that the traction 
is exerted by means of a wire (88) permanently fixed to said part (76) and 

extending through said gap. 
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that the locking 
finger (170) is released by applying thrust on said part (176) from outside 

the thermal protection device through a gap between neighboring unit 
modules. 
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that the locking 
finger (270) is released by acting on said part (276) from inside the primary 

structure (12).  
 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the ball (44; 144; 244) is fixed to the fixing tab (30) in a manner that 

is adjustable by screwing or unscrewing a part carrying the ball, thereby 
enabling the distance between the fixing tab and the ball to be varied so as 

to adjust the position of the fairing element as a function of the desired 
aerodynamic shape independently of dimensional faults in the fairing 

element, in the primary structure, and in the connection means. 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that each fairing element (20) is in the form of an open box having an 

outside face (22; 322) and flanks (24; 324) perpendicular to the outside 
face. 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that each fairing element (20) has a polygonal outside face (22) and the 

fixing tabs (30) are situated in the middles of the sides of the fairing 
elements. 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the each element (320) has a four-edged outside face and the fixing 

tabs (330) are situated in the corners of the fairing elements and extend 
away from the outside face, being perpendicular to planes that are normal 

to the outside face and that contain the diagonals thereof.
