<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic structure defining a cavity (20) includes a first member (30) of high permeability material having a flat surface defining a first wall of the cavity, and a member of permanent magnet material (10) spaced from the flat surface and producing a uniform field in the cavity. The permanent magnetic material member may have two or more layers, with the layers outward of the cavity being of a material having a remanence that is no greater than the adjacent inner layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the provision of a magnetic
structure for producing a uniform field in a cavity. While the
invention is especially adapted for use in NMR imaging, it is
not limited to this field of application.NMR breast imaging, for example, can be performed with
whole body scanners by positioning the region of interest on
the chest wall near the center of the imaging region. In
traditional scanners, the imaging region is usually defined as
a quasi-spherical volume, concentric with the center of the
scanner, where the field satisfies the uniformity levels
dictated by the diagnostic requirements. If such a scanner is
used for breast imaging, the off-center position of the body
results in a very inefficient use of a scanning instrument
whose cavity has been designed to be large enough to
accommodate the whole body of a patient.In principle, any magnet can be designed to generate a
field whose center is arbitrarily chosen within its cavity.
Usually a shift of the center of the field away from the 
geometrical center of the cavity results in a lower figure of
merit, i.e. more energy is required to generate the same
field. If the magnet cavity were closed, the shifting of the
field center would not necessarily affect the uniformity of
the field. In a practical situation, however, if the cavity
must be open, the figure of merit and the uniformity of the
field both deteriorate rapidly as the field center approaches
the magnet opening. In order to maintain the same value of the
field and the same dimension of the imaging region, the size
of the magnet must consequently be increased.An example of this phenomena is a flat bed
superconductive magnet where the coil system is below a flat
platform 3.9 meters in diameter and the imaging region is
above the platform at about 15 cm from its surface. The stray
field of such a magnet is quite large, with the 5 Gauss line
at more than 10 meters from the center of the structure when
the field within the imaging region is 0.2T (See "New Magnet
Designs for MR", D. Hawksworth. Magnetic Resonance in
Medicine, Vol. 9, pp 27-32, 1991)A yoked open structure for generating a uniform field in
a cavity is described in "IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,
Vol.28, No.1, January 1992, pages 931-934". A different
example of a magnetic structure including conical sections for
generating a uniform field in a cylindrical cavity,
particularly for focusing electron beams in electron tubes,
is disclosed in US-A-3,227,931.Briefly stated, the present invention is directed to the
