<ABSTRACT>
A video source (202) provides a temporally interpolated 
video signal (YT), a spatially interpolated video signal (YS) and a 

motion indicating signal (MOT). A difference signal (DIFF), derived 
from the temporally and spatially interpolated signals, is 

symmetrically limited (252) as a function of the motion signal 
amplitude and then combined with the temporally interpolated 

signal to form a motion adapted video output signal (Yest) having (1) 
reduced motion artifacts such as smearing and loss of fine detail; (2) 

reduced noise sensitivity; and (3) enhanced low-contrast motion 
rendition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to television apparatus
and particularly to motion adaptive video signal processing systems.
Motion adaptive video signal processing systems are useful in a
variety of applications. Examples of such uses include interlace-to-progressive
scan converters, standards converters, luminance and
chrominance signal separators and the like. In such systems a motion
signal is generated and used to control a parameter of the processed
video signal such as, for example, the selection, mixing or blending of
two or more processed video signals so as to produce a combined
signal in which visual artifacts due to scene motion are reduced.In a typical application, motion is detected by measuring
the difference in the (luminance) signal level of corresponding pixels
(picture elements) on successive video frames. The absolute value of
this difference produces an estimate of the presence and amount of
motion at that position of the image. Unfortunately, the value of the
frame difference signal at a given picture location is also dependent
on the amount of contrast. As the contrast decreases the value of the
frame difference decreases also. In order to ensure that low contrast
moving pixels are detectable as well as higher contrast moving
pixels, it is conventional practice to compensate for contrast
variations by limiting the frame difference signal to a relatively
narrow range of values.Typically, the absolute value of the frame difference
signal is "clipped" or limited to a relatively small amplitude (e.g., 7
quantization steps) which is then considered to represent full motion.
Since the motion signal thus produced has only 7 quantization levels,
it can be represented by a relatively small word size ( e.g., 3 bits)
and so memory storage requirements for the motion signal are
relatively modest as compared with storage of a "full resolution" (e.g.,
255 levels, 8 bits) motion signal.After motion signal generation and compensation for
contrast variations as noted above, it is conventional practice to
additionally subject the motion signal to motion "spreading" in a
motion signal processor. The term "spreading" refers to the process of
adding to the motion signal motion samples from pixels surrounding 
the pixel being interpolated. In a sense, this process "spreads" or
"expands" the motion detection area so as to be larger than the
particular pixel whose motion is being measured. The advantage of
including a larger number of pixels in the motion determination is
that the probability of
