<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of burning a hydrocarbon fuel in a combustion system includes burning the fuel in a main burner under fuel-lean conditions to produce a main flame and burning a low heating value fuel in a pilot burner to stabilize the main flame and limit the amount of NOx produced in the pilot burner. The pilot fuel can inherently have a low heating value, can be diluted high heating value fuel, or can be made by partially oxidizing a high heating value fuel. An improved combustion system for burning a hydrocarbon fuel with limited NOx emissions has a main burner (2), a pilot burner (10), and a partial oxidation stage (4) capable of converting a high heating value fuel to a low heating value fuel in a partial oxidation reaction. The system also has means for burning the low heating value fuel in the pilot burner. The system can include means (16) for removing heat from the partial oxidation stage or low heating value fuel to lower the temperature of the pilot flame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the combustion 
of hydrocarbon fuels with low NOx emissions. Hydrocarbon fuels have long been known to produce 
atmospheric pollutants when burned. The pollutants 
typically include nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2), frequently grouped together as nitrogen oxides or 
NOx, unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), carbon monoxide (CO), 
and particulates, primarily carbon soot. NOx is of 
particular concern because of its role in forming ground 
level smog and acid rain and in depleting stratospheric 
ozone. Hydrocarbon combustion forms NOx by several 
mechanisms. The high temperature reaction between 
atmospheric oxygen and atmospheric nitrogen, particularly 
at flame temperatures above about 1540째C (2800째F), forms 
NOx through the thermal or the Zeldovich mechanism 
("thermal NOx"). The reaction between atmospheric 
nitrogen and hydrocarbon fuel fragments (CHi), 
particularly under fuel-rich conditions, forms NOx through 
the prompt mechanism ("prompt NOx"). The reaction between 
nitrogen released from a nitrogen-containing fuel and 
atmospheric oxygen, particularly under fuel-lean 
conditions, forms NOx through the fuel-bound mechanism 
("fuel-bound NOx"). Typically, atmospheric oxygen and 
nitrogen are readily available for the NOx-forming 
reactions in combustion air that is mixed with the fuel.  
 To limit NOx formation, many modern combustors burn 
fuel that has little or no nitrogen and operate at 
uniformly fuel-lean conditions. Burning low nitrogen 
fuel reduces or eliminates the formation of fuel-bound 
NOx. Operating under uniformly fuel-lean conditions, for 
example, by using a lean premixed/prevaporized system, 
reduces the formation of NOx by the thermal and prompt 
mechanisms. The excess air used to achieve fuel-lean 
conditions reduces thermal NOx formation by acting as a 
diluent to decrease flame temperatures. The excess air 
also decreases the concentration of CHi available to react 
with atmospheric nitrogen, thereby reducing the formation 
of prompt NOx. The amount of excess air needed to reduce 
thermal and prompt NOx formation can, however, cause the 
combustor to operate near its lean combustion limit, 
resulting in flame instability. Flame stability can be 
improved by supplementing the main flame with a pilot 
flame to ensure that the main flame remains lit, even at 
very lean conditions. For example, JP-A-02 259 331 (as 
shown in Patent Abstract of Japan, vol. 15, no. 008 (M-1067)) 
discloses a method of burning a hydrocarbon fuel 
that
