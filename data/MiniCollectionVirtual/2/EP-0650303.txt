<ABSTRACT>
In a paging system control apparatus that employs a 
POCSAG signal consisting of a plurality of batches each 

consisting of a plurality of groups, it is intended to 
improve the efficiency of using the batches by reallocating 

existing call signals in storing call signals of randomly 
input calls in a queue buffer for the POCSAG signal. The 

apparatus has first and second queue buffers that 
alternately serve as a current-use queue buffer and a 

waiting queue buffer. When it is found that the current-use 
queue buffer has no empty area for accommodating a call 

signal of a new call, all of the call signals stored in the 
current-use queue buffer are transferred to the waiting 

queue buffer so as to be reallocated in sequence from the 
head of the waiting queue buffer and so that empty areas 

are minimized. The reallocation-completed waiting queue 
buffer is changed to a new current-use queue buffer, and 

the new call signal is stored therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paging system
control apparatus and, more specifically, to a paging
system control apparatus which performs a queuing operation
which arranges the call signals of randomly input calls
into a prescribed transmission signal format.Among the transmission signal formats of a call signal
in conventional paging systems is a format arranged in
accordance with the international standard signal scheme
known as the POCSAG signal (CCIR Recommendation 584-1
(1982-1986), Standard Codes and Formats for International
Radio Paging).As shown in FIG. 1, the transmission signal format of
the POCSAG signal scheme consists of a plurality of
batches. Each batch is divided into 8 groups (group 0 to
group 7), and each group is further divided into 2 code
words (hereinafter referred to as CWs). Each of the 8
groups corresponds to the 3 least significant bits of an
identity assigned to each pagers (i.e., 000 = group 0, and
111 = group 7), and all of the pagers used in a paging
system are distributed to the 8 groups.Call data input to a paging system control apparatus 
is converted to a call signal having a paging signal
format. The call signal is constituted of an address CW of
one CW when it does not includes a character display
(messages), and of an address CW of one CW and one or more
message Cws that correspond to the length of the character
message to be displayed. An arrangement is so constituted
that the address CW is necessarily placed in the group
corresponding to the 3 least significant bits of a pagers
address in a call. The message CW(s) occupies the CW next
to the address CW and, if necessary, Cws in subsequent
group or groups accordance with the length of the message.To transmit a POCSAG signal as described above, the
conventional paging system control apparatus has one queue
buffer having a configuration as shown in FIG. 2, and
stores the call signals of the randomly input calls in
their sequence of arrival and sequentially transmits those
in a cyclical manner. In FIG. 2, batch n and batch n+1
denote memory areas of the queue buffer corresponding to
the nth and (n+1)th batches, respectively, and G0-G7
represent memory areas for the respective groups of each
batch and have a memory capacity of 2 Cws.The above-described conventional paging system control
apparatus stores the call signals of input calls in the
queue buffer while queuing those in their sequence of
arrival. Therefore, when call signals are stored in the
queue buffer, for instance, as shown in FIG. 3(b), the
control

<CLAIMS>
A paging system control apparatus which has two queue buffers (1,2) for
temporarily storing a transmission signal format that includes a plurality of batches

each including a plurality of groups that are related to identification numbers of
respective pagers, and which stores randomly input call signals in a said queue buffer

(1,2) and later transmits these together, characterised in that:

two queue buffers (1,2) are alternately used as a current-use queue buffer and
a waiting queue buffer;
by a reallocation section (5) for transferring all of the call signals stored in the
current-use queue buffer to the waiting queue buffer while reallocating the call

signals, when it is found that no empty area is available for a new call during a
queuing operation on the call signals in the current-use queue buffer; and
by a means (4,5) for changing the waiting queue buffer to which the call
signals have been reallocated completely to a new current-use queue buffer and the

current-use queue buffer to a new waiting queue buffer, and then making the queuing
operation on the call signals continue.
The paging system control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
reallocation section (5) reallocates the call signals so that they are sequentially

arranged from a head section to an end section of the waiting queue buffer by
sequentially retrieving, from the current-use queue buffer, call signals that can be

accommodated without being overwritten over a call signal that has already been
transferred. 
The paging system control apparatus according to claim 2, further comprising:

an origination pointer (6) for indicating an original location of an existing call
signal;
a destination pointer (7) for indicating a destination location of the existing call
signal; and
a group number storage section (8) for storing a group number of an existing
call signal to be transferred,

wherein the reallocation section (5) comprises:

a group number writing means for determining the destination group
number based on the destination pointer (7), and for writing the determined group

number to the group number storing section (8);
a retrieving means for retrieving, from the current-use queue buffer, an
existing call signal that belongs to a group of the destination group number stored in

the group number storage section (8);
an original location of a call signal location writing means for writing
positional information for the existing call signal retrieved by the retrieving means to

the origination pointer (6);
a call signal transferring means for transferring the call signal indicated
by the origination pointer (6) to a location of the waiting queue buffer indicated by the

destination pointer (7);
a next code word positional information writing means for writing
positional information for a code word next to, on the waiting queue buffer, that of the

call signal that has been transferred by the call signal transferring means;
a next group positional information writing means for changing positional 
information for the destination pointer (7) to that of a next group when no existing call

signal is detected by the retrieving means; and
a judging means for judging the completion of reallocation when the
destination pointer (7) indicates the last positional information and the next positional

information cannot be set therein in the next code word positional information writing
means or the next group positiona
l information writing means.
