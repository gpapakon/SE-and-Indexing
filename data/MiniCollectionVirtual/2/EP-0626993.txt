<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel additive composition. More
particularly, this invention relates to a fuel additive
composition containing a poly(oxyalkylene) hydroxyaromatic
ether and a poly(oxyalkylene) amine.It is well known that automobile engines tend to form
deposits on the surface of engine components, such as
carburetor ports, throttle bodies, fuel injectors, intake
ports and intake valves, due to the oxidation and
polymerization of hydrocarbon fuel. These deposits, even
when present in relatively minor amounts, often cause
noticeable driveability problems, such as stalling and poor
acceleration. Moreover, engine deposits can significantly
increase an automobile's fuel consumption and production of
exhaust pollutants. Therefore, the development of effective
fuel detergents or "deposit control" additives to prevent or
control such deposits is of considerable importance and
numerous such materials are known in the art.For example, aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenols are
known to reduce engine deposits when used in fuel
compositions. U.S. Patent No. 3,849,085, issued November
19, 1974 to Kreuz et al., discloses a motor fuel composition
comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling
range containing about 0.01 to 0.25 volume percent of a high 
molecular weight aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol in
which the aliphatic hydrocarbon radical has an average
molecular weight in the range of about 500 to 3,500. This
patent teaches that gasoline compositions containing minor
amount of an aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol not
only prevent or inhibit the formation of intake valve and
port deposits in a gasoline engine, but also enhance the
performance of the fuel composition in engines designed to
operate at higher operating temperatures with a minimum of
decomposition and deposit formation in the manifold of the
engine.Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,134,846, issued January 16,
1979 to Machleder et al., discloses a fuel additive
composition comprising a mixture of (1) the reaction product
of an aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol,
epichlorohydrin and a primary or secondary mono- or
polyamine, and (2) a polyalkylene phenol. This patent
teaches that such compositions show excellent carburetor,
induction system and combustion chamber detergency and, in
addition, provide effective rust inhibition when used in
hydrocarbon fuels at low concentrations.Poly(oxyalkylene) amines are also well known in the art as
fuel additives for the prevention and control of engine
deposits. For
