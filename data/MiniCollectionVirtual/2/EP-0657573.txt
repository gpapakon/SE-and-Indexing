<CLAIMS>
Safety closure device for the drum door-flaps (1,
3) of a laundry washing machine, of the type with two

parts (13, 16-18, 20-22, 23) with mutual snap-fitting,
one (13, 18, 22) of which is integral with one of the

door-flaps (1) and the other (16, 20, 23) of which is
integral with the second door-flap (3), characterized in

that at least one of the door-flaps (1) includes a part
(11) in relief which, when the drum is closed, masks the

closure device, and in that the end (2) of this door-flap
covers over the end of the other door-flap when the drum

is in the closed state.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the part in relief is a convex part obtained by

drawing a delimited zone (11) of the door-flap which
partially covers over the other (1) when the drum is

closed.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the part in relief is a concave part obtained by

drawing a delimited zone of the door-flap (3) which is
partially covered over by the other when the drum is

closed.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the part in relief is a convex part of the end of

the door-flap which partially covers over the other, and
a concave part of the end of the other door-flap, these

concave and convex parts being obtained by bending the
ends of the two door-flaps.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the part in relief is an attached piece masking an

opening made in the door-flap, one of the two parts of 
the closure device, fastened on this door-flap, partially

penetrating into the opening.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the door-flap which partially

covers over the other includes a concave zone (4) which
serves as a support zone for closing the two door-flaps.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the support zone is substantially centred with

respect to the width of the door-flap and in that its
width is less than that of the door-flap, and in that the

door-flap includes other concave drawn zones (8, 9) on
either side of the support zone in order to prevent the

ejection of objects between the two door-flaps.
