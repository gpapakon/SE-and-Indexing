<ABSTRACT>
A low pass filter (14) is provided between an input buffer (19) and 
an input resistor (22) succeeding a first input terminal (16) to which a 

sound signal converted from digital format to analog format is 
inputted. After its digital noise is removed by the low pass 

filter, the sound signal is added to analog sound signals 
inputted from second and third input terminals (17,18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for generating 
a sound based on a D/A converted analog signal such as a 
game apparatus and an audio apparatus. Conventionally, an adding circuit for adding a plurality of 
analog signals, which is used, for example, in an audio apparatus 
for karaoke, is designed as shown in Fig. 1 such that an 
internal analog sound signal obtained through a reproduction of 
a cassette tape is mixed with external analog sound signals 
inputted from external microphones, and outputted after amplified 
by an amplifier 1. Fig. 2 shows a more specific example of a circuit arrangement 
of such an adding circuit. External analog sound signals 
inputted to first and second input terminals 2 and 3 and an 
internal analog sound signal inputted to a third input terminal 
4 are inputted through buffers 5, 6 and 7 and input resistors 8, 
9 and 10, respectively, to an inverting input terminal of an 
operational amplifier 11, so that these analog sound signals are 
mixed and amplified. Then, the signals are outputted to a 
succeeding sound outputting circuit from an output terminal 12 
and released as a sound from a speaker. Reference numeral 13 represents a feedback resistor having 
a resistance value R20. In this case, the voltage gain is  VOUT/VIN = -R20/R10  
, where R10 represents the resistance value 
of the input resistors 8, 9 and 10, and VIN and VOUT represent 
input and output voltages, respectively, . In recent years, apparatuses of a type are increasingly 
used which process a sound signal after converting it into 
digital format and thereafter output a sound signal converted 
from digital format to analog format (this sound signal will 
hereinafter be referred to as "digital processing sound signal"). 
For this reason, it is desired that adding circuits used 
for such apparatuses are capable of adding analog and digital 
processing sound signals excellently. However, the digital processing sound signal converted from 
digital format to analog format is not a smooth sine wave but 
includes noise caused by the digitization in its high frequency 
band (hereinafter referred to as "high band"), and the waveform 
is distorted in a high-frequency region. Therefore, if such a digital processing sound signal 
including noise and wave distortion is inputted to the conventional 
adding circuit and added, the output sound signal will be 
distorted and includes high-band digital noise. This is 
undesirable. An object of the present invention is to provide a sound 
generating apparatus
