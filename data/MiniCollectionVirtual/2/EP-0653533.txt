<ABSTRACT>
Lock for a key-operated locking of the espagnolette of the fitting of a slide-and-tilt window, consisting of a lock case which is inserted in the window casement and which has a bolt which is displaceable at right angles to the direction of displacement of the espagnolette and which, in the locking position, projects with a stepped extension out of the lock case and engages positively into a perforation of the espagnolette and which can be actuated by means of the key-operated locking bit of a built-in profiled cylinder, the built-in profiled cylinder being pushed longitudinally displaceably into the lock case and being lockable by means of a screw extending transversely to its longitudinal extension and parallel to the direction of displacement of the bolt and engaging into a threaded hole of the built-in profiled cylinder, the screw which serves for locking the built-in profiled cylinder being formed by a grub screw actuable by means of a spanner with inner engagement, and the spanner being capable of being introduced into the corresponding recess of the grub screw solely through a perforation in the espagnolette transferred into the closed position.

A lockable fitment for tilt-slide windows (13), 

having a drive bar (11) which is displaceable and which by virtue of 
displacement thereof moves the window leaf (14) into various positions 

which include a closed position, 
and having a key-operable lock (10) for fixing the drive bar (11), 
comprising a lock housing (15) fitted in the frame of the window 
leaf (14), 
an installation profile cylinder (20) which is fitted in the lock 
housing (15) and which has a locking bit (19) operable by the key, 
and a lock bolt (16) which is movable at a right angle relative to 
the drive bar (11) 
and which is operable by the locking bit (19) of the installation 
profile cylinder (20) and which in its locking position projects with a 

reduced projection portion (17) out of the lock housing (15) and 
positively lockingly engages into an opening (18) in the drive bar (11), 
wherein the installation profile cylinder (20) is fixed in the lock 
housing (15) by a screw which extends in fact transversely to the 

longitudinal extent of the installation profile cylinder (20) but 
parallel to the direction of movement of the lock bolt (16) and engages 

into a screwthreaded hole (23) in the installation profile cylinder (20), 
 
   characterised in that 


the screw serving to fix the installation profile cylinder (20) is 
formed by a screwthreaded pin (24) which is operable by a screw spanner 

with internal engagement and which has a corresponding recess (26) for 
engagement of the screw spanner, and 
the drive bar (11) has an opening (25) through which the screw 
spanner can be fitted into the recess (26) in the screwthreaded pin (24) 

only when the drive bar is in the displacement position characterising 
the closed position of the window leaf (14). 
A fitment according to claim 1 characterised in that in its 
tightened position the screwthreaded pin (24) bears in force-locking 

relationship with its free end (27) against an abutment (28) of the lock 
housing (15).  

 
A fitment according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the screwthreaded pin (24) is guided with its end (29) towards the screw 

spanner in a securing portion (30) which is fitted in the lock housing 
(15). 
A fitment according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
screwthreaded pin (24) cuts its own screwthreaded hole (31) into which it 

is screwed in the securing portion (30) which comprises plastics 
material. 
A fitment according to one or more of claims 1 to 4 characterised 
in that for assembly and removal the screwthreaded pin (24) can be 

unscrewed until it comes out of the installation profile cylinder (20) 
and then engages with its outer end (29) into the opening (25) in the 

drive bar (10) which has been moved into the closed position. 
A fitment according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that 
the screwthreaded pin (24) has a recess in the form of a hexagonal 

recess.
