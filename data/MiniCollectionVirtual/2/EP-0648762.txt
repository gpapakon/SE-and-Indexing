<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel bicyclic
compounds which are antagonists of excitatory amino acids at
excitatory amino acid receptors, to pharmaceutical
compositions containing them and to intermediates useful in
their preparation.In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the
transmission of nerve impulses is controlled by the
interaction between a neurotransmitter, that is released by a
sending neuron, and a surface receptor on a receiving neuron,
which causes excitation of this receiving neuron. L-Glutamate
is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the CNS,
and mediates the major excitatory pathway in mammals.
Glutamate is referred to as an excitatory amino acid (EAA).
The receptors that respond to glutamate are called excitatory
amino acid receptors (EAA receptors). See Watkins and Evans,
Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.,21, 165 (1981); Monaghan,
Bridges, and Cotman, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.,29, 365
(1989); Watkins, Krogsgaard-Larsen, and Honore, Trans. Pharm.
Sci., 11, 25 (1990). The excitatory amino acids are of great
physiological importance, playing a role in a variety of
physiological processes, such as long-term potentiation
(learning and memory), the development of synaptic
plasticity, motor control, respiration, cardiovascular
regulation, and sensory perception.Excitatory amino acid receptors are classified into two
general types. Receptors that are directly coupled to the
opening of cation channels in the cell membrane of the
neurons are "ionotropic" excitatory amino acid receptors.
This type of receptor has been subdivided into at least three
subtypes, which are defined by the depolarizing actions of
the selective agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
acid (AMPA), and
kainic acid (KA). The second general type of receptor is the
G-protein or second messenger-linked "metabotropic" 
excitatory amino acid receptor. This second type is coupled
to multiple second messenger systems that lead to enhanced
phosphoinositide hydrolysis, activation of phospholipase D,
increases or decreases in cAMP formation, and changes in ion
channel function. Schoepp and Conn, Trends in Pharmacol.
Sci., 14, 13 (1993). Both types of receptors appear not only
to mediate normal synaptic transmission along excitatory
pathways, but also participate in the modification of
synaptic connections during development and throughout life.
