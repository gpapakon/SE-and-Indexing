<ABSTRACT>
A fixing apparatus includes a heating member (6); 
a temperature detecting member (4) for detecting the 

temperature of the heating member (6); a power supply 
controller for controlling the power supply to the 

heating member (6) so that the temperature detected by the 
temperature detecting element (4) during a fixing 

operation is maintained substantially constant at a 
predetermined fixing temperature; and temperature 

selecting means for selecting a fixing temperature in 
response to both the temperature or the heating member 

before beginning of the fixing temperature control and 
a rate of the temperature change of the heating member 

upon supplying a predetermined amount of power to the 
heating member or upon turning it off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fixing
apparatus
according to the
preamble of claim 1.In the past, a heat roller system as shown in
Figure 2 has been widely in use as the fixing system
for fixing thermally a toner image onto the recording
material.In this system, a fixing roller 9 comprising
a metallic core made of aluminum or the like material
and a heat resistant separating layer made of PFA or
the like is heated from within by a heater 10. The
temperature of the fixing roller 9 is read by a
temperature detecting element placed in contact with
the surface of the fixing roller and is sent to an
unshown control circuit, which turns on or off the
heater 10 so that the fixing roller temperature is
maintained at a predetermined one. The fixing roller
9 forms a nip in cooperation with a pressure roller 2,
and through this nip, a sheet of paper P carrying a
toner image T is passed, whereby the toner image T is
fused to the sheet of paper P; in other words, it is 
fixed.However, in this system, the temperature of
the fixing roller 9 had to be kept high even during
the standby period, for the reason that it took a relatively long time
for the heat from the heater 9 to reach the fixing
roller surface.Such a system is disclosed in JP-A-57 70575 where a predetermined
fixing temperature is set and the electric power supplied to
the heating means is controlled according to the temperature
change rate.Therefore, in order to minimize the warmup
time as well as to save entirely the power consumed
during the standby period or reduce it to a minimum, a
fixing apparatus of a different type has been devised,
which comprises a heater, which has an extremely small
thermal capacity and whose temperature quickly rises,
and a film which slides on this heater.In such an apparatus in which the high
temperature is not under control during the standby
period, the fixing performance is greatly affected by
the apparatus temperature at the time when the fixing
operation begins; for example, the high temperature
off-set is caused by the toner melted excessively, or
on the contrary, under fixation is caused by the lack
of heat.Therefore, another type of fixing apparatus,
disclosed in US-A-5 266 774 corresponding to EP-A-0 436 955, has been
devised. From document EP 0 436 955 A3 a fixing apparatus is known
comprising a heater maintained at a control temperature by a
controlling device. A film is provided being in contact with the
heater and movable together with and in sliding contact with a
recording material carrying a visualized
