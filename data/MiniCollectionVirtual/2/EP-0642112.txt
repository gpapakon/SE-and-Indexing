<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drive voltage generating circuit employed
in a drive unit such as a liquid crystal display or the like, and particularly to a
drive voltage generating circuit suitable for providing integrated circuitry,
which changes a drive voltage to adjust contrast.As a drive voltage generating circuit used in a liquid crystal panel,
there is known one described in Japanese Patent Application No. 4-54815,
for example. Since a bias potential control circuit is added to the drive
voltage generating circuit, the drive voltage generating circuit eliminates the
need for provision of contrast adjusting variable resistors which have
heretofore been used as external parts. Further, temperature coefficients of
resistors forming a bias circuit of the drive voltage generating circuit can be
made identical to those of resistors of the bias potential control circuit so as
to cancel variations in resistor, which take place according to temperatureHowever, the above drive voltage generating circuit causes a trade-off
between power consumption and the quality of a reproduced image if
one attempts to make improvements in the two.EP-A-0,479,304 discloses a power source apparatus for driving liquid crystal
display. A plurality of resistors are serially connected with each other between a
maximum voltage level "V" and a minimum voltage level "0" in order to provide for
the generation of voltage-divided intermediate voltage levels. These are supplied
to a first group of operational amplifiers, whose first stage input portions are formed
of N-channel MOSFETs and a second group of operational amplifiers whose first
stage input portions are formed of P-channel MOSFETs. Transistor circuits are
connected in parallel to resistors of the voltage divider such that applying a logical
"1" to one of the transistor circuits causes a short circuit to occur between the two
ends of a respective resistor of the voltage divider.It is an object of the present invention to provide a drive voltage
generating circuit having low power consumption and achieving high quality
of image reproduction.To achieve this object the present invention provides a drive voltage generating circuit as defined in independent claim 1. The dependent claims define particular embodiments of the invention. A drive voltage generating circuit according to an
embodiment of
the present invention comprises drive output terminals for outputting drive
signals having voltage levels, a bias circuit having a first voltage terminal to
be applied to a first voltage
