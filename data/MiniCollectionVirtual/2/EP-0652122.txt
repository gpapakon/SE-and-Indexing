<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydropneumatic suspension device for a motor vehicle. The device is of the type comprising at least one suspension actuator (10) for one wheel (8) of the vehicle, a pump (4) for supplying the actuator with liquid from a reservoir (5) of the said liquid, a valve (17) actuated by a mechanical control for correcting the height of the body of the vehicle, so as to isolate the actuator (10) or alternatively connect it to the said pump (4) or to the said reservoir (5), and an anti-sinking (anti-fade) valve (25) placed between the valve (17) and the suspension actuator (10) and capable of being opened by means sensitive to the pressure of the liquid upstream of the valve (17) when this pressure exceeds a predetermined threshold. The device is characterised in that the valve (17) is contrived so that in the neutral position when the body of the vehicle is in the normal state, it establishes between the pump (4) and the reservoir (5) a flow path for fluid (44) at low pressure, and in that a pressure limiter (22) is placed upstream of the valve (17) to ensure, when the latter is in the position for exhausting the suspension actuator, in which it closes off the arrival of liquid, a continuous return flow to the reservoir and the maintaining of a pressure higher than the abovementioned threshold on the means (26, 29) for opening the anti-sink valve (25). The invention can be used in motor vehicles.

Hydropneumatic suspension device for an automotive vehicle, 
of the type comprising at least one suspension jack (10) for 

one wheel (8) of the vehicle, a pump (4) for feeding the jack 
with liquid from a tank (5) for the said liquid, a valve (17) 

actuated by a mechanical control for the correction of the 
heigth of the vehicle body, so as to isolate the jack (10) or 

to connect it alternately to the said pump (4) or to the said 
tank (5) and an anti-sagging valve (25) placed between the 

valve (17) and the suspension jack (10) and adapted to be 
opened by means sensitive to the pressure of the liquid 

upstream of the valve (17) when this pressure exceeds a 
predertermined threshold, characterized in that the valve (17) 

is arranged so that in the neutral position when the body of 
the vehicle is in the normal state, it provides between the 

pump (4) and the tank (5) a low pressure fluid flow way (44) 
and in that a pressure limiter (22) is placed upstream of the 

valve (17) to ensure, when the latter is in the position of 
exhausting the suspension jack wherein it shuts off the liquid 

feed, the continuous return flow to the tank and the keeping 
of a pressure higher than the aforesaid treshold upon the 

opening means (26, 29) of the anti-sagging valve (25). 
Suspension device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a flow restriction (34) is provided on the return circuit 

(33) to the tank (5) of the liquid coming from the suspension 
jack (10) through the valve (17) being in the eduction 

position. 
Suspension device according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the anti-sagging valve (25) and the 

pressure limiter (22) are integrated into the body (40) of the 
valve (17).
