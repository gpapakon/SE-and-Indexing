<ABSTRACT>
A simple refill container for holding a refill detergent, which is 
capable of being displayed plurally in a small space, carrying out the refilling 

of the content simply and reliably, and being discarded simply. 
The container consists of a thermoformed container body, and a seal 

film with which an opening at the lower end of the container body is 
sealed. A tapering cylindrical shoulder portion is joined to an upper 

edge of the trunk portion of the container body, and a nozzle tube (4) 
the upper end of which is closed with a top plate portion (21) extends 

upward from the central part of the shoulder portion. When a material 
is packed in the container body, and, when the refill containers are displayed 

after they have been refilled with a material, the shoulder portion 
is depressed into the interior of the trunk portion. In order to pack 

the content of a refill container into another refill container, the shoulder 
portion is projected outward from the trunk portion, and the free 

end portion of the nozzle tube is cut off to form an injection port.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a simplified refilling
container for use in containing detergents, shampoos and the
like.Containers for containing detergents, shampoos and the like
are required to satisfy the conditions such as (1) being able
to fully contain a content, (2) being able to open and close
repeatedly, (3) being able to inject a content stably and
without trouble, and (4) being easy to handle. As such a
container, bottle containers are generally employed in the
prior art.Containers capable of satisfying said conditions are
complicated in structure; they require many processes
in the production thereof and a comparatively great deal of a
material in molding the material into one container to thereby
increase a unit price of production.While, said containers can be reused sufficiently without
any inconvenience since said conditions are not lost even
after the content of the containers was exhausted. However,
these containers have hitherto been disposed. As above-mentioned,
disposal of the containers does not meet with a
requirement to nurse resources and it is difficult to burn
the containers, because they are made of a
comparatively great deal of a synthetic resin material.In order to eliminate these disadvantages, a consuming
cycle gains public favor, in which a content such as 
detergents, shampoos and the like is contained in a simplified
refilling container and the content contained therein is
refilled in said exhausted bottle container to use the same
content.Conventional refilling containers broadly used include
self-standing containers molded in the form of a bag. Such
a refilling container has the superior advantages that a unit
price of production is extremely low and also it can be
easily disposed.Though said conventional bag-shaped refilling container is
opened by cutting the corner thereof with scissors and the
like, the shape of the opening can not be constant in such a
manner. When the shape of the opening is not constant as such,
a content in the refilling container is spilt outside another
container upon refilling it in this other container.
Particularly, in case said other container is a container
having a small-sized opening such as a bottle container, the
content is easy to be spilt. Further, the refilling
container is soft in its entirety and lacks in self-shape
holdability, so that the entire container should be supported
by both hands during refilling operation. Thus, when the
refilling work is effected by one person, the other container to
be refilled can not be
