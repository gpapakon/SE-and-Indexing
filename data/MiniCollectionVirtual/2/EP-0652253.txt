<ABSTRACT>
The cycloolefin resin compositions of the present 
invention comprise a thermoplastic resin containing an olefin 

polymer having an alicyclic structure, specific stabilizers 
selected from phenolic stabilizers, organic thioether 

stabilizers, organic phosphite stabilizers, UV-ray absorbers 
and hindered amine stabilizers. The cycloolefin resin 

compositions show excellent thermal aging resistance and 
weathering resistance by the use of specific stabilizers, and 

therefore they are favorably used for forming optical 
instrument parts. Furthermore, the thermoplastic resin may 

be prepared from an olefin polymer having an alicyclic 
structure and a flexible polymer or flexible polymers. The 

incorporation of the flexible polymer especially improves the 
mechanical strength of the resultant products, and therefore 

the resin compositions are favorably used for machine parts, 
electronic parts, automobile parts, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cycloolefin resin
compositions having excellent thermal aging resistance and
weathering resistance as well as excellent heat resistance,
chemical resistance, solvent resistance, dielectric
characteristics, rigidity characteristics, dimension
stability and impact resistance. The present invention
further relates to cycloolefin resin compositions suitable
for producing resin molded products having high transparency
such as optical instrument parts.Polyolefin resins which are widely used as general
purpose resins are excellent in heat resistance, solvent
resistance and dielectric characteristics. After further
improving the heat resistance, rigidity, dimension stability,
impact resistance, etc. of the polyolefin resins having such
excellent characteristics, the present inventors once
proposed novel cycloolefin random copolymers (for example, in
Japanese Patent L-O-P Nos. 168708/1985 and 120816/1986)
having alicyclic structures, and prepared from ethylene and
bulky cycloolefins. The inventors further proposed a method
for blending the cycloolefin random copolymers with specific
polymers (for example, Japanese Patent L-O-P Nos. 163236/1989 
and 163241/1989) to improve the impact resistance of the
cycloolefin random copolymers. Though these resin
compositions have excellent characteristics under ordinary
using conditions, the resin compositions tend to be oxidized
under severe conditions at alicyclic structures, that is, the
constituent units derived from cycloolefins, because the main
component of the resin compositions is an olefin resin having
an alicyclic structure. Such resin compositions gradually
deteriorate in their excellent characteristics that alicyclic
structure olefin resins such as cycloolefin random copolymers
have as inherent properties when exposed to an environment at
high temperature over a long period of time. The resin
compositions also tend to be deteriorated when irradiated
with such light having a short wavelength as an UV-ray, and
show lowering of physical properties when exposed to sunlight
in the open air over a long period.Synthetic resins are often used for manufacturing
optical instrument parts such as optical lenses, optical disc
substrates and optical fibers in place of conventionally used
glass.It is desirable that optical instrument parts
manufactured from such synthetic resins have high
transparency, rigidity and impact resistance.As the resins having such excellent properties, there
have been conventionally used transparent resins such as
