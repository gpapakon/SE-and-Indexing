<ABSTRACT>
Isotropic hot-pressed iron-rare earth metal 
permanent magnets are provided wherein the hot-pressed 

permanent magnets exhibit magnetic remanences of at 
least 9 kG, and most typically about 10 kG. Preferred 

compositions include a relatively low rare earth 
content coupled with an optimal amount of boron. The 

preferred composition is, on a weight percent basis, 
from about 5 to about 25 percent rare earth, most 

preferably about 10 to about 20 percent rare earth, 
from about 0.5 to about 4.5 percent boron, most 

preferably from about 0.8 to about 4.0 percent boron, 
wherein the total combination of the rare earths and 

boron ranges from about 9 percent to about 26 percent 
of the composition, most preferably from about 12 

percent to about 22 percent, and optionally from about 
2 percent to about 16 percent cobalt, with the balance 

being essentially iron.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
the making of high remanence hot-pressed permanent 
magnets based primarily on iron, rare earths such as 
neodymium and/or praseodymium and/or dysprosium, and 
boron, as specified in the preamble of claim 1 More 
specifically, this invention concerns the forming of 
such magnets having magnetic remanences of at least 
9 kiloGauss (kG), and most typically about 10 kG, by 
hot-pressing permanent magnet particles having, in 
weight percents, a rare earth level of from about 5 
percent to 25 percent, cost preferably from about 10 
percent to about 20 percent, and preferably combined 
with a boron content of from about 0.5 percent to 
about 4.0 percent, most preferably from about 0.8 
percent to about 4.0 percent, wherein the total amount 
of the rare earth constituent and boron ranges from 
about 9 percent to about 26 percent, most preferably 
from about 12 percent to about 22 percent. Permanent magnets based on compositions 
containing iron, neodymium and/or praseodymium, and 
boron are known and in commercial usage. Such 
permanent magnets contain as an essential magnetic 
phase grains of tetragonal crystals in which the 
proportions of, for example, iron, neodymium and boron 
are exemplified by the empirical formula Nd2Fe14B. 
These magnet compositions and methods for making them 
are described by Groat in US Patent No. 4,802,931 
issued February 7, 1989. The grains of the magnetic 
phase are surrounded by a second phase that is 
typically rare earth-rich, as an example 
neodymium-rich, as compared with the essential 
magnetic phase. It is known that magnets based on 
such compositions may be prepared by rapidly 
solidifying, such as by melt-spinning, a melt of the  
 
composition to produce fine-grained, 
magnetically-isotropic platelets of ribbon-like 
fragments. Magnets may be formed from these isotropic 
particles by practices which are known, such as 
bonding the particles together with a suitable resin. Although the magnets formed from these 
isotropic ribbons are satisfactory for some 
applications, they typically exhibit an energy product 
(BHmax) of about 8 to about 10 megaGaussOersteds 
(MGOe), which is insufficient for many other 
applications. To improve the energy product, it is 
known to hot-press the isotropic particles to form 
magnets having an energy product of about 13 to about 
14 MGOe and magnetic remanences of the order of about 
8 kG. However, there are applications when it 
would be desirable that such hot-pressed magnets 
should have
