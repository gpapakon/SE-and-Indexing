<ABSTRACT>
In a device for adjusting the narrow sides of a continuous casting mould for the purpose of adjusting the width and taper of the casting format of a continuous casting mould during casting, one narrow side (2) of the mould can be adjusted by means of an upper and a lower spindle drive (8, 9). To provide a simple, operationally reliable and space-saving device, the upper spindle drive (8, 9) has an upper guiding axle (5) on which an eccentric pin (20) connected in articulated fashion to a girder (4) of the narrow side (2) of the mould is rotatably mounted, the rotational position of the pin being determined by the position of the guiding axle (5).

Device for the adjusting of chill mould narrow side walls for width 
and conicity adjustment of the casting format of a continuous casting 

chill mould during the casting, wherein a chill mould narrow side wall is 
adjustable by an upper and a lower spindle drive, which are driven in 

common by a motor and connected with the chill mould narrow side wall, 
characterised thereby that the upper spindle drive (8, 9) has an upper 

guide axle (5), at which an eccentric pin (20), which is articulatedly 
connected with a support (4) of the chill mould narrow side wall (2), is 

rotatably mounted, and gearwheels (22), which are each in rolling 
engagement with a respective rack (23) fastened to a frame (7), are 

fastened to the eccentric pin (20). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the upper 
spindle drive (8, 9) is connected with a motor shaft (15) by way of a 

bevel gear drive (11) and the bevel gear drive (11) is connected with a 
bevel gear drive (12) of the lower spindle drive (8, 9) by way of a 

connecting shaft (14), wherein the connecting shaft (14) consists of two 
portions connected by an adjustable coupling (13).
