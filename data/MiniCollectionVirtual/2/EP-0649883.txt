<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pigment compositions, their preparation and their use.In GB 2 160 212A there are described azo pigment compositions comprising a compound
obtained by coupling a diazonium salt of a benzene- type amine having a carboxyl group
or sulphonic group at the meta or para position with respect to the amino group and
beta-naphthol or beta-hydroxynaphthoic acid, or a metal or organic amine salt of this
compound, and a naphthol-type azo pigment. Such compositions are said to improve the
stability of the pigment against recrystallisation. It is stated that when a beta-naphthol
coupling component used in the preparation of such compositions is replaced by a mixture
of 97.5 mole % of beta-naphthol and 2.5 mole % of 2-naphthol-5-sulphonic acid, the
resulting pigment composition has inferior colouring power (colour strength).GB-A 1,313,417 discloses pigment compositions comprising a laked azo dyestuff
and a water-soluble reaction product of an amine having at least 8 carbon
atoms with a water-soluble dyestuff. The azo dyestuff can be derived from any
diazotised aromatic amine mono- or di-sulphonic or mono- or di-carboxylic acid
coupled with a α- or β-naphthol or a sulphonated derivative thereof. No specific
dyestuffs derived from a diazotised amine or sulphonated acid group meta or
para to the amino group coupled with a naphtholsulphonic acid are disclosed.It has now surprisingly been found that pigment compositions having excellent colour
strength, as well as very good transparency and flow properties, which are particularly
useful in the formulation of printing inks, especially publication gravure inks, can be
obtained by preparing an azo pigment modified by a product obtainable by coupling a
diazonium salt of an aromatic primary amine having a carboxyl group or a sulphonic acid
group meta or para to an amino group with naphtholic coupling component comprising at
least 50 mole % of a naphtholsulphonic acid, particularly when the thus modified pigment
is also resinated with organic resins conventionally used for the resination of pigments.Accordingly, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a pigment composition
comprising (A) an azo pigment, (B) an azo reaction product of (i) a diazonium salt of a
primary aromatic amine having a carboxyl group or suiphonic acid group meta or para to
an amino group with (ii) a coupling component comprising one or more unsubstituted or
substituted naphthols, at least 50 mole % of said coupling component being a
naphtholsulphonic acid, or a salt of said

A pigment composition comprising

(A) an azo pigment, wherein (A) is derived from a diazonium salt of a primary aromatic
amine substituted on the aromatic nucleus ortho to the amino group by an acidic
