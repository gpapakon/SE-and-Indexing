<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for assisting in reversing and coupling trailers to motor vehicles, having ultrasonic sensors which are attached to the motor vehicle, are constructed as transmitter and receiver units and are connected to a control and display device with which, using only one medium, a precise determination of the position of a coupling unit which is arranged between the motor vehicle and has one coupling device is to be realised. For this purpose, there is provision for one trailer which has a coupling device, preferably a shaft, to be assigned to the motor vehicle, the shaft having a further ultrasonic sensor (SD) which is constructed as transmitter and receiver unit.

<CLAIMS>
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers, which device is mounted on a motor vehicle

and on a shaft of a trailer, sensors (S1, S2, S3), a
control unit (10) and a display (12) being provided on

the motor vehicle, and a sensor (SD) being provided on
the shaft, characterized in that the sensors are

designed as transmitting and receiving units (S1, S2,
S3, SD), and in that these are ultrasonic sensors.
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to Claim 1, characterized in that

the ultrasonic sensor (SD) on the shaft has a time
controller and its own power supply.
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that, in the device for assisting in
hitching up trailers the direct (shortest) path of the

pulse (I') between the ultrasonic sensor (SD) on the
shaft and the ultrasonic sensors (S1, S2, S3) attached

to the motor vehicle is used.
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the motor vehicle has three
ultrasonic sensors (S1, S2, S3), of which one

ultrasonic sensor (S2) precisely in the centre of the
vehicle is assigned to a coupling jaw (16).
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that the motor vehicle has five 
ultrasonic sensors (S1 to S5), of which one ultrasonic

sensor (S2) precisely in the centre of the vehicle is
assigned to a coupling jaw (16).
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the ultrasonic sensors (S1, S2,
S3) on the motor vehicle are designed in such a way

that they simultaneously transmit at a time (t
s
) a pulse
(I) which the ultrasonic sensor (SD) replies to at a

time (t
shaft
).
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the pulse (I') of the ultrasonic
sensor (SD) on the shaft triggers a new pulse of the

ultrasonic sensors (S1, S2, S3) on the motor vehicle in
each case.
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the ultrasonic sensors (S1, S2,
S3) on the motor vehicle automatically transmit a

synchronization pulse at specific time intervals.
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the ultrasonic sensors (S1, S2,
S3) on the motor vehicle are arranged at a constant

distance (x) from one another.
Device for assisting in reversing and hitching
up trailers according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the control device (10) is
configured in such a way that it assesses the

plausibility of the signals of the ultrasonic sensors
(S1, S2, S3) on the motor vehicle.
