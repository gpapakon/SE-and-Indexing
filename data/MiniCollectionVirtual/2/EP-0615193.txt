<ABSTRACT>
Under the condition where write defect is detected in blocks of a data region of an EEPROM (16), the data, which should 
be written into the defective block, is written into an empty block of a relief region. If the relief region becomes full and write defect 

is detected in the blocks of the data region, the data, which should be written into the defective block, is written into an empty 
block of the data region. When an empty block is secured in the relief region due to erasure of the data under the state where the 

blocks of the data region are used for relief, the data of the block used for relief in the data region is transferred to this empty 
block.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a memory card device 
using an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable 
Read Only Memory) as a semiconductor memory and, more 
particularly, to a memory card device suitably used for 
an electronic still camera apparatus or the like for 
converting an optical image of a photographed object 
into digital image data and recording the image data in 
a semiconductor memory. As is well-known, an electronic still camera apparatus 
for converting an optical image of a photographed 
object into an electrical image signal using a solid-state 
imaging device, converting the image signal into 
digital image data, and recording the data in a semiconductor 
memory, has been developed. In this type of 
electronic still camera apparatus, a memory card including 
a semiconductor memory in a card-like case is formed 
detachably from the body of the camera apparatus so that 
the memory card can be handled in the same way as a film 
of a normal camera is. At present, the memory card of the electronic 
still camera apparatus is being standardized, and 
a large memory capacity semiconductor memory for  
 
recording a plurality of items of digital image data is 
required as the semiconductor memory included in the 
memory card. For example, an SRAM (Static Random Access 
Memory), a mask ROM, an EEPROM capable of electrically 
writing and erasing data, and the like are taken into 
consideration, and a memory card using the SRAM has been 
already commercialized. While the memory card using the SRAM has advantages 
wherein it can be adapted to a data structure of whatever 
format and the data write/readout speed is high, it 
has drawbacks wherein a backup battery for holding the 
written data has to be put into the memory card and thus 
a memory capacity is reduced by the space for the backup 
battery and the cost of the SRAM itself is increased 
uneconomically. In order to eliminate the drawbacks of the SRAM, 
the EEPROM has attracted attention as a semiconductor 
memory used in a memory card. More specifically, the 
EEPROM attracts attention as a recording medium in place 
of a magnetic disk, and has the advantages of requiring 
no backup batteries and decreasing the cost of a chip 
which are different from those of the SRAM. Therefore, 
the EEPROM is greatly improving in using as a memory 
card. FIG. 1 shows the merits and demerits of a memory 
card using an SRAM (SRAM card) and a memory card using 
an EEPROM (EEPROM card). With respect to the backup 
battery of item 1 and the cost of item 2

   EEPROMs each having a data area and a save area 

including a plurality blocks each having a fixed 
capacity; 

   save means for, when one of the blocks of the data 
area is detected as a defective block in writing, 

searching the save area for a vacant block and writing 
data, which is to be written to the defective block, to 

the vacant block and, when the save area is occupied and 
one of the blocks of the data area is detected as a 

defective block in writing, searching the data area for 
a vacant block of the data area and writing data, which 

is to be written to the defective block, to the vacant
