<ABSTRACT>
A helmet system incorporating:
 

   a non-rigid helmet (100);
 

   a relatively stiff mounting bracket (110) mounted on the 
helmet;

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to helmets.Helmet mounted displays provide convenient and quick
means for accessing vital flight information, particularly
for fighter pilots where reaction time in response to
certain stimuli is extremely important. Helmet mounted
displays typically include an image source which is mounted
on a helmet and projects an image onto a visor also mounted
on the helmet. Such displays are described, for example, in
U.S. Patent 3,923,370 and in U.S. Patent 4,761,056.The helmet of a fighter pilot is generally intended to
protect his head from dangerous impact in situations such as
a crash or circumstances of wind blast arising from a
broken canopy. Typical helmets are constructed from a thin
lightweight shell and a transparent polycarbonate visor. The
helmet shell is relatively flexible to allow for comfortable
donning and doffing.In modern helmet mounted displays, the visor is an
optical component whereby an image generated by an optical
module is projected onto the visor and reflected towards the
pilots eye. Hence, preventing visor deformation is critical
for achieving good optical performance. Furthermore, visors
used in such helmets are apt to lift upwards under strong 
wind pressure against the visor, experienced for example,
when the aircraft's canopy is ruptured. Needless to say, it
is important for visors to remain in place in the face of
strong wind pressure.One method of helmet construction which achieves a
stable non-deforming visor uses a rigid shell as an optical
platform, where both the visor and an optical module are attached
to the shell. The rigidness of the shell prevents any
deformations of the visor from arising. However, such a
solution makes donning and doffing of the helmet inconvenient.
Furthermore, the rigidness of the shell is achieved at
the expense of extra, otherwise unnecessary weight that
makes the helmet uncomfortable to wear for extended periods
of time. EP-A-0290293 discloses an aircrew helmet which has a rear part and a front
part. The rear part comprises a shell shaped to extend partially over the top of the
wearer's head and to each side of the head. The front part is shaped to fit against the
rear part to complete the shell of the helmet, and is detachably connected to the rear
part. The front part is shaped to accommodate equipment for optical protection or
enhancement, such as a visor or night vision goggles. A single helmet may have two
or more interchangeable front parts with different optical equipment. The front part
may be connected to

<CLAIMS>
A helmet comprising a helmet shell (100) and a visor (114) rotatably mounted
on the helmet shell (100), characterised by a support bracket (110) mounted on the

helmet shell (100), on which the visor (114) is rotatably mounted, and formed with an
extension (108) operative to obstruct upward rotary movement of the visor (114)

when the visor (114) is deformed towards the helmet shell (100) by wind pressure
resulting from a wind in the range of 134 m/s to 268 m/s (300 to 600 miles per hour) but being inoperative

during normal rotary movement of the visor (114) in the absence of such deformation.
A helmet according to claim 1, characterised by a display image source (112)
which is attached to the support bracket (110) and which projects images onto the

visor (114) and in that the position of the projected images is adjustably changed by
changing the mounting position of the bracket (110) on the helmet shell (100).
A helmet according to claim 2 characterised in that an adjustment in said
mounting position results in a vertical movement of the image on the visor (114).
A helmet according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that an adjustment

in said mounting position results in a horizontal movement of the image of the visor
(114).
A helmet according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the visor
(114) is constructed out of a relatively shape retaining material.
A helmet according to claim 5, characterised in that the relatively shape
retaining material is polycarbonate plastic.
A helmet according to any preceding claim, characterised by visor fasteners.
