<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve operating 
device for use in an internal combustion engine for 
varying operating characteristics of a pair of engine 
valves in multi-stages depending upon operating conditions 
of the engine. Such valve operating devices have been already known, 
for example, from Japanese Utility Model Publication 
No. 6801/91. In the above prior art device, four cams having 
different profiles are provided to come into sliding 
contact with four rocker arms disposed adjacent one 
another, including two rocker arms independently operatively 
connected to a pair of intake valves, so that the 
connection and disconnection of adjacent rocker arms can 
be switched from each other, and the operating characteristics 
of the pair of intake valves can be switched 
through at least four or more stages. However, the rocker 
arm corresponding to the high-speed cam having the profile 
corresponding to the high-speed operating range of the 
engine is disposed at one end of the arrangement of 
adjoining rocker arms. For this reason, in opening and 
closing the intake valves by the high-speed cam with all 
the rocker arms connected to one another, the driving 
force from the high-speed cam is applied so that the 
rocker arm in sliding contact with the high-speed cam and 
the rocker arm adjacent such rocker arm are moved away  
 
from each other at their connected portions, resulting in 
a problem in the rigidity of all the rocker arms connected 
to one another and in a risk that the driving force from 
the high-speed cam is not transmitted equally to the 
intake valves. Document GB-2197686-A discloses a valve operating mechanism for 
an internal combustion engine. In this valve operating mechanism 
a cam shaft is provided with four cams provided successively in 
a longitudinal direction of the cam shaft. Each of the cams is 
associated with a rocker arm for controlling the movement of two 
valve bodies. One of the cams is provided for a high speed 
operational region of the engine, one is provided for a medium 
speed one and one is provided for a low speed one. However, the 
cams provided in this valve operating mechanism are not disposed 
symmetrically with respect to the two valve bodies which are to 
be operated. Thus, there arises the problem that, due to an 
asymmetric arrangement of the cams and the frictional forces 
occurring upon actuation by that asymmetric arrangement, the 
respective valve bodies are not correctly actuated. The present invention has been accomplished with such 
ci
