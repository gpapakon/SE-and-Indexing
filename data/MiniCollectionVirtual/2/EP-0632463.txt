<ABSTRACT>
An electronic device uses a pseudo-SRAM (14) having 
a self-refreshing function, as a memory, and a refresh 

timing signal having a predetermined period is supplied 
to the pseudo-SRAM in the operation state of the electronic 

device. When no key operation is performed with 
a keyboard (17) for a predetermined period of time, the 

electronic device switches a mode into an idle mode to 
stop supply of an operation clock to a CPU (11) and to 

stop supply of the timing signal to the pseudo-SRAM. 
When the supply of the timing signal to the pseudo-SRAM 

is stopped, the pseudo-SRAM operates the self-refreshing 
function for holding data with low power consumption. 

When a key operation is detected in the idle mode, a 
refresh timing signal having a high frequency is supplied 

to the pseudo-SRAM for a predetermined period of 
time. Thereafter, the supply of a clock to the CPU is 

restarted, and the state of the electronic device is 
returned to a normal operation state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
device such as an electronic notebook or a compact electronic
calculator which is driven by a battery power
supply and uses a pseudo-SRAM, having a self-refreshing
function, as a data memory.In a conventional electronic device such as an
electronic notebook or a compact electronic calculator
driven by a battery power supply, when a DRAM which must
be refreshed is used as a memory, refresh pulses must be
supplied to the DRAM at a predetermined interval. In
addition, even in a device using a pseudo-SRAM having a
self-refreshing function, although the self-refreshing
function is used in a power-off state, the self-refreshing
function is not used in a power-on state
because timing control is complicated in a normal
operation state. Therefore, in the normal operation
state or use of the device, refresh pulses are always
supplied to the DRAM or the pseudo-SRAM at a predetermined
interval.However, in such an electronic device using a
battery power supply, as in a case wherein a key input
operation or communication is not performed for a long
period of time in a normal operation state, even when a
CPU is not actually operated, clocks and refresh pulses
are kept supplied to the CPU and a memory. For this
reason, the power of the battery power supply is 
wasted.WO-A-90 16029 discloses a computer wherein power is saved by setting the computer in a "sleep
mode". In this mode, the system clock is suspended from being supplied to the CPU (50) during
periods in which the computer is not used (cf p.1,1.15-22). In an alternative arrangement (fig.3A),
power is saved by setting the computer in a "standby or low-power mode". In this mode, the
computer is disconnected, excepted the system-RAM (67), from the power supply during periods
when the computer is not used, and wherein the loss of the refresh timing signal for the system-RAM
is compensated for by realising the system-RAM in form of a pseudo-SRAM (cf fig.7: U26, U27,..
and p.20,I.18- p.21,I.10; cf also p.11.I.14-17) having its own internal refresh timing. A combination
of the "sleep mode" and the "standby mode" is not suggested: Due to hardware details of the CPU
(50), the operation in the "standby mode " requires that the "sleep mode" is disabled (cf p.9, I.9-25).The present invention has been made in consideration
of the above circumstances, and has as its object
to provide an electronic device capable of preventing
power consumption from being wasted in a state in which
a CPU waits for a key input operation for a long
