<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a femoral stem prosthesis 
but more particularly relates to a surface hardened highly 
polished femoral stem prosthesis. Recently, femoral hip stems have been developed and 
patented for improving implant fixation in a cemented use 
which calls for the implant to be highly polished. The 
highly polished implant is designed to subside within a 
hardened cement mantle to improve fixation during use. The 
highly polished surface of the implant prevents or 
substantially prevents the implant from bonding with the 
bone cement so that it may shift relative to the cement 
without abrasion. Preferably, the implant is made from a 
high strength forged Co-Cr-Mo alloy (ASTM designation F-799) 
which has its surface polished to a high degree (also 
known as color buff finish) to provide for a smoothness 
having a target surface roughness of four microinches. A 
more thorough understanding of this type of hip stem may be 
had by a reading of United States Patents 5,171,275 and 
5,171,288 issued on December 15, 1992, to Ling et al and 
Mikhail et al respectively. United States Patents 
5,171,275 and 5,171,288 are incorporated herein by 
reference. The femoral hip stem of this invention calls for a 
geometry substantially similar to the implants of the 
incorporated reference 5,171,275. The implant of the 
invention however is formed from a titanium alloy 
(preferably Ti-6Al-4V) which has been surface hardened and 
the color buffed to a smoothness similar to the 
incorporated references. If a titanium alloy implant were 
merely buffed, as is taught by the incorporated reference, 
microabrasion between the implant and the cement mantle 
would rough the surface of the implant. The roughened 
surface of the implant would become abrasive to the cement  
 
mantle and thereby generate wear debris with relative 
movement between the implant and the cement mantle. Accordingly the invention provides a femoral hip joint 
prosthesis for insertion into a prepared intramedullary 
canal with cement comprising an elongated stem extending 
from a proximal end to a distal end and defining a first 
axis, said proximal end having a neck region which joins 
the stem at a juncture, said stem having anterior, 
posterior, medical and lateral surfaces and said surfaces 
tapering downwardly from said juncture to said distal end;
 
   said neck region defining a second axis disposed at an 
obtuse angle with the first axis, and
 
   said medial surface defining a smooth arcuate path 
from the stem across the juncture
