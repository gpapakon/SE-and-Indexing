<CLAIMS>
Natural or artificial seeds intended for sowing
and treated, characterized in that they contain a

nonphytotoxic labelling quantity, detectable by analysis,
of a combination of at least two rare earths, in a

concentration ratio which is significantly different from
those found naturally in the soil, the quantity of rare

earths, expressed as weight of metal, being from 0.1 to
1000 ppm, and preferably from 0.1 to 100 ppm, by weight

relative to the seed.
Seeds according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the concentration ratio differs by a factor of at least

2 in relation to that found naturally in the soil.
Seeds according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the concentration ratio differs by a factor of between 2

and 100 in relation to that found naturally in the soil.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that they contain two rare earths.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that they contain three rare earths.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the rare earths are chosen from the

group including neodymium, terbium, europium, lanthanum,
samarium, lutetium, yttrium and ytterbium.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the treatment is a treatment with

a spraying mixture or a powder.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the treatment is a coating.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the treatment is a dressing. 
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the treatment is a pregermination

treatment.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that they are cereal seeds.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that they are maize seeds.
Seeds according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that they are sunflower seeds.
Process for obtaining seeds according to one of
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that seeds are treated

with a spraying mixture or a powder or a coating,
dressing or pregermination treatment formulation

containing a combination of at least two rare earths, the
quantity of rare earths, expressed as weight of metal

relative to the seed, being as defined in Claim 1.
Process for preparing plants, characterized in
that the said plants result from the germination or

propagation of the seeds obtained according to the
process of Claim 14.
Process for obtaining seeds according to Claim
14, characterized in that the formulation additionally

contains at least one agrochemical active substance.
Process for the identification of the source and
the date of treatment of natural or artificial seeds for

sowing and treated, which consists:

in introducing a combination of at least two rare
earths on to the seed, the quantity of which, expressed

as weight of metal relative to the seed, is as defined in
Claim 1,
and in analysing the concentration ratio of these
rare earths in the seed residue.
Process according to Claim 17, characterized in
that the analysis is performed after the seed has

sprouted.
Process according to either of Claims 17 and 18,
characterized in that, between the treatment and the

analysis, the seed is sown.
Process according to one of Claims 17 to 19, 
characterized in that two rare earths are introduced.
Process according to one of Claims 17 to 19,
characterized in that three rare earths are introduced.
Composition for the treatment of natural or
artificial seeds for sowing and treated, characterized in

that it contains a nonphytotoxic labelling quantity,
detectable by analysis, of a combination of at least two

rare earths, in a concentration ratio which is
significantly different from those found naturally in the

soil, the quantity of rare earths, expressed as weight of
metal relative to the seed, being as defined in Claim 1.
Composition according to Claim 22, characterized
in that it additionally contains at least one

agrochemical active substance.
