<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing cycloolefin polymers from 
cyclic and acyclic olefin monomers using a catalyst 

system in a reaction space, which comprises 
separating the residence time of the monomers in the 

reaction space from the residence time of the 
catalyst system in the reaction space, wherein the 

separation of the residence times of the monomers 
and of the catalyst system is achieved by fixing the 

catalyst system on a support and by installing a 
porous partition in the reaction space. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
fixing of the catalyst and/or of the cocatalyst on 

the support is carried out under the action of 
microwaves. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
average porosity of the partition lies between 0.1 

and 50 µm, preferably between 0.25 and 20 µm and 
particularly preferably between 2 and 10 µm. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
support materials used are silica gels, aluminum 

oxides, solid aluminoxane or other inorganic support 
materials such as, for example, magnesium chloride 

or a partly crystalline polyolefin powder which is 
insoluble under the polymerization conditions and is 

in finely divided form.  
 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
catalyst system comprises at least one metallocene 

catalyst and at least one cocatalyst. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
monomers used are from 0.1 to 99.9% by weight, based 

on the total amount of monomers, of at least one 
monomer of the formulae I, II, III or IV
