<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for data and image processing, having a processing equipment. The object on which the invention is based consists in providing a novel method and a corresponding equipment for data and image processing which, inter alia, overcomes the disadvantages of recording tapes which can only be played linearly or the complicated change between various recording media from tape, via hard disk, to once-only writeable CD (compact disc) etc. According to the invention, this is achieved in that in combination of loss-free and also loss-affected methods, items of data for describing images and sequences of images and also images and sequences of images for describing items of data are generated and are stored and used in a multidimensionally constructed or multidimensionally organisable memory system for further processing. A better registration, evaluation, transmission, reproduction and storage of data and images, preferably for the audio-visual human perception system is hence possible. The invention can be applied particularly in image-producing systems of all types and also in other systems for processing large quantities of data from measured values, signals and data of the most diverse kind.
