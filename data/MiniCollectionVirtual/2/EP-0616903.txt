<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cap for a writing instrument on which is fixed a clip with a retaining eyelet projecting approximately at right angles, through which a pin engages inside the cap. This cap (2) has a lateral recess (3) into which the retaining eyelet (6) can be pushed. The special design of the pin and clip (4) permits easy exchange of the clip (4) for another clip.

Top for a handwriting device on which a clip with a 
projecting, approximately rectangular eyelet-holder is 

attached and which is passed through by a pin, 
wherein
a top (2) has a recess (3) into which an eyelet-holder 
(6) can be slid, 
a pin concerned has a main section (14) and a section 
(12) which has a reduced extension, in relation to a main 

section (14), transverse to a lengthwise direction of a 
said pin, and a said pin can move in a lengthwise 

direction such that either a main section (14) or a 
section (12) with reduced cross-sectional extent passes 

through an opening (5) of an eyelet-holder (6), 
an eyelet-holder (6) has an open clearance (7, 7'), on 
an area of its periphery facing away from a clip (4), 

width of which is greater than cross-sectional extent of a 
section (12) and smaller than that of a main section (14) 

of a said pin, and 
a pin concerned has spring tension applied to it which 
brings a said pin into an idle position in which a main 

section (14) lies in an opening (5) of an eyelet-holder 
(6). 
Top in accordance with claim 1, 
wherein
 a main section 
(14) and a section (12) of a pin concerned are 

cylindrically developed and disposed coaxially in relation 
to each other and an opening (5) of an eyelet-holder (6) 

is circular. 
Top in accordance with claim 2, 
wherein
 an outer diameter 
of a main section (14) is only slightly shorter in  

 
extension that an inner diameter of an opening (5) of an 

eyelet-holder (6), such that an eyelet-holder sits on a 
pin with play. 
Top in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 a 
pin guided in a central boring (8, 10) in a said top and a 

head (10), which projects from a tip of a top (2), is 
attached onto a said pin. 
Top in accordance with claim 1, 
wherein
 
a section (12) with a reduced cross-sectional extent 

borders on a head (16) and a main section (14) adjoins an 
end of a section (12), which faces away from a head (16), 

and a helical spring (20) is applied between a head (16) 
and a contact surface (11) in a boring of a top concerned, 

this helical spring forcing a head (16), and a pin 
connected to it, outwards.
