<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to new and useful
improvements in clsoures for containers, particularly
containers which have a tubular body and an open end
which is to be closed by a closure such as an end unit.There have been developed closures for containers,
particularly cans, which include removable end panels.
These closures include a peripheral frame having peelably
bonded thereto an end panel. When containers
incorporating such closures are subjected to post-filling
treatment including retorting or high vacuum, positive or
negative pressure is built up within the container with
the result that the end panel flexes axially outwardly or
inwardly and has a tendency to internally initiate
peeling from the frame. This can result in improperly
sealed containers.WO91/08958 on which the preamble of claim 1 is based
describes a closure of the type described above.Another problem with closures of this type is the
securement of the closure to the container. There is a
great need for a closure which can be tightly sealed and
permanently attached to a container by merely applying
heat and an axial pressure on the closure after it has
been seated on the container. According to the present invention there is provided a
closure for a container, the closure comprising an open
frame and a closure panel having a peripheral portion,
said open frame defining a generally inflexible inner
peripheral ledge for receiving in sealed relationship
said peripheral portion of said closure panel by being
seated on said ledge and bonded thereto, said closure
being characterised by said frame having a radially
inwardly projecting flexible flange forming an extension
of said generally inflexible ledge, said peripheral
portion of said closure panel being also seated on and
bonded to said flexible flange.One feature of the invention is the forming of a closure
which includes a frame, formed of thermoplastic material,
defining an axially outwardly facing ledge on which there
is seated a peripheral portion of an end panel with that
peripheral portion being peelably bonded to the ledge.
The end panel is formed of a flexible material and should
there be internal pressure different from atmospheric
pressure, such as during pressure cooking or vacuum
processing, the end panel will bulge either outwardly or
inwardly. During any outward bulging of the end panel,
such as during a retort operation, there was 
a tendency for the end panel to begin peeling from
the ledge at the inner edge of the ledge. In
accordance with this invention, the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A closure (10) comprising an open frame (14) and a
closure panel (16) having a peripheral portion, said open

frame defining a generally inflexible inner peripheral
ledge (28) for receiving in sealed relationship said

peripheral portion of said closure panel (16) by being
seated on said ledge (28) and bonded thereto, said

closure being characterised by said frame (14) having a
radially inwardly projecting flexible flange (36) forming

an extension of said generally inflexible ledge (28),
said peripheral portion of said closure panel being also

seated on and bonded to said flexible flange (36).
A closure according to claim 1 wherein said
peripheral portion of said closure panel (16) is in

sealed peelable relationship with said ledge (28) and
flange (36).
A closure according to either claim 1 or claim 2
wherein said closure panel is subjectable to axial

bowing, said flexible flange (36) being bowable with said
closure panel (16) for preventing internally initiated

peeling of said closure panel from said generally
inflexible ledge (28).
A closure according to any one preceding claim
wherein said closure panel (16) has a pull tab (30) for

peeling said closure panel from said ledge and said
flexible flange. 
A closure according to any one preceding claim
wherein said flange (36) is an integral part of said

frame (14).
A closure according to any one preceding claim
wherein said end panel (16) has a free outer peripheral

edge (40).
A closure according to any one preceding claim
wherein said frame (14) has means (64, 20) for sealing

attachment to an open ended container (12).
A closure according to any one preceding claim
wherein said frame (14) is of a molded plastic

construction.
A closure according to either claim 7 or claim 8
wherein said frame is particularly shaped (64, 20) for

receiving a reversely and radially outwardly turned curl
(52) of a container (12) in sealed relation.
A closure according to any one preceding claim from
7 to 9 wherein said frame is particularly shaped (64, 20)

for receiving a reversely and radially outwardly turned
curl (52) of a container (12) in mechanically interlocked

(66, 68) sealed (64) relation.
A closure according to any one preceding claim from
7 to 10 wherein said frame configuration includes a

downwardly opening groove (64) in an underside of said 
frame, said groove being in part defined by an outer

depending skirt (20) depending beyond said groove.
A closure (10) and container (12) assembly, said
assembly comprising a container (12
) having an open end
defined by a reversely turned curl (52) terminating in an

outermost raw edge (54), and a closure (10) including a
peripheral plastic frame (14) formed of heat-softenable

plastic, said frame being of a configuration including a
downwardly opening groove (64) receiving said curl (52),

said groove being in part defined by a downwardly sloping
plastic skirt (20) forming part of said plastic frame,

means usable for inductively heating and softening said
plastic skirt, and said raw edge (54) being embedded in

said plastic skirt (20), said frame defining a radially
inwardly positioned ledge (28) which faces axially

outwardly, a flexible end panel (16) seated on said ledge
and sealed to said ledge in inwardly peeling relation, a

pull tab (30) carried by said end panel (16) for peeling
said end panel from said ledge (28) characterised by said

frame having a flexible flange (36) with an axially
outwardly facing surface forming a continuation of said

ledge (28), said flexible flange (36) being bonded to
said end panel (16) and being capable of flexing with

said end panel without internally initiated peeling.
