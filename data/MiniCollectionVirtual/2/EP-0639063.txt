<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
medical tympanic
infrared thermometers,
more particularly to a
medical tympanic
infrared thermometer which uses an
optical waveguide.Sensing of infrared emission to measure temperature can
be undertaken by one of many sensors known to the art, such
as thermopiles, pyroelectrics, bolometers, and active
infrared sensors. An infrared sensor generates an electrical
signal which is representative of two temperatures. One is
the surface temperature of the sensor Ts, and the other is
the temperature of the object or target Tb. The relationship
between these temperatures and the response of the sensor is
governed by Stefan-Boltzmann law,
V = kεbεs(Tb 4-Ts 4)
where V is the output signal of the sensor, εb and εs are
emissivities of the target and sensor respectively, and k is
a constant.The ultimate goal of non-contact temperature measurement
as in an optical infrared thermometer is to determine the
temperature Tb of the target. It is seen from equation 1,
that to calculate Tb, one must first determine two numbers,
a reading V from the infrared sensor, and the surface
temperature Ts of the sensor.The term "surface temperature" means a surface
temperature of a sensing element positioned inside the
sensor's packaging.Obtaining the surface temperature of the sensor is not
easy. An infrared sensor with a good response speed is
generally fabricated in the form of a thin flake or membrane. 
The surface temperature is not only difficult to measure, but
changes upon exposure to a target. Inaccurate determination
of the surface temperature Ts of a sensor results in an
erroneous temperature measurement.In order to overcome the problem, an alternative method
of measuring temperature Tb was developed. Instead of
measuring the temperature of surface Ts, temperature Ta of a
reference target is employed. Usually, measurement of Ta can
be performed with better accuracy. Therefore, equation 1 is
modified to be:
V = kεbεs(Tb 4-Ta 4)In some inventions, such as the one described in U.S.
patent No. 4,005,605 patented by Michael, the reference
target is a cavity inside the thermometer. In U.S. patent
No. 4,797,840, patented by Fraden, a fast moving shutter
which occludes the sensor's field of view before measurement,
serves as a reference target.In any case, temperature of a reference target Ta must
be measured with high accuracy before it can be fed into
equation 2 for calculating Tb. Since that equation demands
measurement of two independent variables V and Ta, at least
two sensors must be used in
