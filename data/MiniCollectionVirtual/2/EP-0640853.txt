<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated
optical device, and more particularly to a hybrid type
integrated optical device having optical components such as
laser diodes, photo-isolators, and photodiodes, respectively
integrated on a single substrate; also, to a method of manufacturing
such a device.Fig.16 shows a conventional transceiver for optical
communications. A laser diode chip 1⊘3 is fixed to a subcarrier
1⊘1, with a heat sink 1⊘2 being interposed
therebetween. Lenses 1⊘5 and 1⊘8 are fixed to lens holders 1⊘4
and 1⊘7. An optical fiber 11⊘ is fixed by an optical fiber
holder 111.A laser beam emitted from a laser diode chip 1⊘3 is
collimated by the lens 1⊘5, passes through an optical member
1⊘6 such as a optical-isolator, is converged by the lens 1⊘8,
and guided to the optical fiber 11⊘.For the alignment of an optical axis, the sub-carrier
1⊘1, lens holders 1⊘4 and 1⊘7, optical member 1⊘6, and optical
fiber holder 111 are all placed on a fine positional adjuster
to precisely align the optical axes with one another. This alignment is performed by measuring the
intensity of a laser beam emitted from the laser diode chip
1⊘3, entering the optical fiber 11⊘, and outputted therefrom.
After the optical axis alignment, the holders and carriers are
fixed to a substrate 1⊘⊘, for example, by laser welding.With this method, it is necessary to use an assembly
apparatus equipped with a fine adjuster which performs a
precise position alignment. It takes a long time to finish optical
axis alignment. As a result, manufactured optical devices
become expensive.It is difficult to make optical components compact
because these components are required to be mounted on the
assembly apparatus. It is also necessary to change the
structure of the assembly apparatus each time the structure of
an optical device is changed. This method therefore is not
suitable for manufacturing a small number of, and a variety of,
optical devices.Fig.17 shows the structure of an integrated optical
device eliminating the above disadvantages, as proposed in the
Proceedings of the 1992 IEICE Autumn Conference, page4-235.Lenses 121 arid 124 are fitted in lens guide holes 127
and 128 formed on a single crystal silicon substrate 12⊘ to fix
the lens positions. As the lens guide holes, via holes may be
used which are of an upside-down pyramid shape surrounded by
the (1 1 1) planes exposed by anisotropically etching a silicon
substrate having the (1 ⊘ ⊘) plane. To eliminate a so-called "eclipse" (occlusion) of a laser
beam at the surface of the
