<ABSTRACT>
A film feed device for feeding films (F) connected to a 
leader (L) to a negative carrier (22) one after another. A guide 

block (27) is provided at a film inlet side of the negative 
carrier provided along the exposure axis (X). Film feed units (30) 

having film passage thereon are provided on the guide 
block. A feed unit having a pair of pulleys and a timing 

belt is mounted under the guide block to move the guide 
block in a direction perpendicular to the feed direction of 

the films. Ahead of the guide block is provided a cutter 
device (60) to cut the two films when the rear end of the leader 

reaches the cutter device. The film aligned with the film 
inlet of the negative carrier is supplied thereto and 

printed. Then, by moving the guide block until the other 
film is aligned with the film inlet of the negative 

carrier, the other film can be printed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a film feed device for use 
in a film printing apparatus, by which a developed film 
attached to a leader is fed to a negative carrier provided 
along the exposure axis. In an automatic film developing machine, when a film 
is developed, two films F are usually connected to a leader 
L and fed to the automatic film developing machine with the 
leader L ahead (Fig. 11). After developed in the automatic film developing 
machine, the films are fed to a film printing apparatus for 
printing. In such a conventional film printing apparatus, since 
the roll of developed film was developed one by one, the 
film F was usually cut off from the leader L and fed to the 
film printing apparatus one after another to be printed. 
Therefore, the printing was troublesome. Also, each of the 
films F cut off from the leader L had to be stored. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
film feed device which can obviate abovesaid problems and 
which can feed the developed films to the film printing 
apparatus with the film connected to the leader. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a film feed device for use in a film printing apparatus for  
 
feeding films attached to a leader to a negative carrier 
provided along an exposure axis, the film feed device 
comprising a guide block provided at a film inlet side of 
the negative carrier and formed on top thereof with two 
film passages extending toward the negative carrier, a 
plurality of feed units for feeding the films connected to 
the leader to the guide block, a cutter device for cutting 
off the films from the leader when the rear end of the 
leader has passed the guide block, a leader discharge 
means for discharging the leader cut off from the films 
from a film path, a film feed means for feeding the film 
from the film passage to the negative carrier, and a 
transfer means for moving the guide block in a direction 
perpendicular to the feed direction of the film to align 
one of the two film passages with the film inlet of the 
negative carrier. In the film feed device according to the present 
invention, the leader as well as the films connected 
thereto are fed to the guide block. After the rear end of 
the leader has passed the guide block, the front ends of 
the two films are cut off from the leader by the cutter 
device. Next, the leader is discharged from the film 
transfer path by the leader discharge means. Then, one of 
the films on the film passage aligned with the film inlet 
of the negative
