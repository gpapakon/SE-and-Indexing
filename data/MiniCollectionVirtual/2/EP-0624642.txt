<ABSTRACT>
A novel thrombolytic agent which can be obtained from a cell-free 
culture filtrate of fermentations of Bacillus Sphaericus 

Serotype H5a and H5b by a process which comprises obtaining a 
cell-free culture filtrate from the known culture broth of 

the fermentation of Bacillus Sphaericus Serotype H5a and H5b, 
subjecting said cell-free culture filtrate to a step of ultrafiltration 

in order to obtain a concentrated retentate, 
followed by salting out substantially all protein from said 

concentrate using a salting agent such as ammonium sulphate, 
converting the salted out protein into an aqueous solution 

and subjecting said solution to decolourization using a modified 
cellulose, subjecting the decolourized fraction to 

dialysis and lyophilization to obtain a crude powder of said 
protein, followed by preparing a solution of said crude 

powder und subjecting same to a chromatographic treatment to 
obtain a purified material, and finally lyophilizing said 

purified material to obtain the thrombolytic agent, said 
process as well as the use of the agent for preparing a 

thrombi dissolving medicament.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of
thrombinase. Thrombinase is a thrombi dissolving agent containing
a fibrinolytic enzyme having an advantageous application for the
treatment of cerebral thrombosis, myocardial infarction, deep
vein thrombosis and in the prevention of post surgical adhesion.Streptokinase (from Streptococci), Urokinase (from human urine)
and Tissue Plasminogen Activator, (TPA, from human tissue
culture) are the main thrombolytic agents currently known in the
art. Streptokinase-aspirin combinations provide a significant
relief even if the treatment is commenced 24 hrs after a heart
attack. Prourokinase, also known as kidney plasminogen activator,
is designed to dissolve clots in the blood without interfering
with the body's normal blood clotting process. Beecham Laboratories
clot dissolving product, an isolated plasminogenstreptokinase
activator complex, trade named, Eminase, is claimed to have
reduced the death rate in heart attack victims by 50%. Genentech's
TPA (Activase) is also highly effective in dissolving
blood clots. Urokinase, Streptokinase and TPA, the first
plasminogen activators available for clinical use, activate the
plasminogen to active plasmin. The actual clot lysis is carried
out by the active plasmin. The action of plasmin, however, is not
restricted to the lysis of fibrin present in thrombus; plasmin
also attacks fibrinogen and other clotting factors, which can
lead to severe bleeding. Fibrinolytic potency and specificity of
these agents are markedly enhanced by covalently linking them to
a fibrin specific antibody. This type of targetting the fibrinolytic
agent to the site of thrombi opens up the possibility of
using direct acting fibrinolytic enzymes in the place of
plasminogen activators.It is an object of this invention to propose a novel process for
the preparation of thrombinase.It is another object of this invention to propose such an
improved process which will utilize material now discarded as 
waste in the known fermentation processes of Bacillus Sphaericus
Serotype H5a and H5b.It is a still further object of this invention to propose such
a process which will employ the waste or discarded material in employ
the above conventional process to produce useful chemicals as a
by-product in an economical manner so that the known main
fermentation itself becomes more economical and productive.It is thus a still further object of this invention to propose
an improved process for the production of biopesticide.In known fermentations of

<CLAIMS>
A thrombolytic agent which can be obtained from a
cell-free culture filtrate of fermentations of Bacillus

Sphaericus serotype H5a and H5b and which has an optimum
enzymatic activity range from pH 7 to 9 and a molecular

weight (gel filtration) of about 18.500.
A process for the preparation of a novel thrombolytic
agent according to claim 1, which comprises


obtaining a cell-free culture filtrate from the
known culture broth of the fermentation of Bacillus

Sphaericus Serotype H5a and H5b,
subjecting said cell-free culture filtrate to a step
of ultrafiltration in order to obtain a concentrated

retentate,
followed by salting out substantially all protein
from said concentrate using a salting agent such as

ammonium sulphate,
converting the salted out protein into an aqueous
solution and subjecting said solution to decolourization

using a modified cellulose,
subjecting the decolourized fraction to dialysis and
lyophilization to obtain a crude powder of said protein,
followed by preparing a solution of said crude powder
and subjecting same to a chromatographic treatment

to obtain a purified material, and
finally lyophilizing said purified material to obtain
the thrombolytic agent.
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the modified
cellulose is a commercially available product called

"DE52" supplied by Whatman Biosystems Ltd., England. 
A process as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein the dialysis
and lyophilization of the cellulose treated fraction

is carried out by using a semi-permeable membrane (10000
daltons cut off) and a lyophilizer respectively to obtain

said crude powder of the protein.
A process as claimed in any of the claims 2 to 4, wherein
the chromatographic treatment is carried out in two stages

v.i.z. a first stage of ion exchange chromatography
and a second stage of gel filtration chromatography.
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the first stage
of ion exchange chromatography is carried out by subjecting

a solution of the crude powder to Q Sepharose (Pharmacia
Ltd., Sweden) anion exchange chromatography using

0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 0.001 M CaCl
2
 and
stepwise elution using the same buffer containing 0.1 M

NaCl and 0.5 M NaCl respectively.
A process as claimed in claim 5 or 6, wherein the second
stage gel filtration chromatography is carried out by gel

filtration on Sephacryl S3000 (Pharmacia Ltd., Sweden)
using 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 M

NaCl.
A process as claimed in any of the claims 2 to 7, wherein
