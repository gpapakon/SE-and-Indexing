<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a frustum-shaped braking body 
(12) that has a continuous circular shape and is supported 

in front of, and coaxially to, the drum (T) of the feeder 
(10) in order to engage the thread (F) that runs between 

the braking body and the drum. The braking body (12) is 
subjected to the electrodynamic action produced by a 

modulated energization current (I) that circulates in an 
energization coil (17) that is rigidly coupled to the 

braking body and interacts with the field of a permanent 
magnet. The energization coil (17) is arranged on the 

frustum-shaped braking body (12) at the region of tangent 
contact with the drum (T), and the magnetic interaction 

field is produced by an annular magnet (18) which is 
substantially toroidal and is arranged so as to face the 

coil (17) at the outer face or at the inner face of the 
frustum-shaped braking body (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the
positive modulated braking of thread for devices for feeding
weft to shuttle-less looms, particularly to gripper looms,
projectile looms, and air-jet looms.In the present description, the term "positive braking"
is used to define the modulated braking of the thread
produced by the action of an electric energization current
which is modulated so as to match the variations in the
mechanical tension of said thread during the weaving
process.More specifically, the present invention relates to a
device for the positive modulated braking of thread of the
type comprising a braking body having a continuous circular
shape, typically the shape of a frustum. The braking body is
supported by elastic means frontally and coaxially with
respect to the drum of the feeder
and is actuated into elastic contact engagement with its lager cross-section against the drum along a tangency circumference of the drum in order
to engage the thread that
runs between said braking body and said drum, and the
braking body is subjected to the electrodynamic action
produced by the interaction of an energization current that
circulates in a coil associated with the braking body and of
the magnetic field of a permanent magnet that is fixed with
respect to said braking body.A positive modulated braking device of this type is
disclosed in EP-A-0 536 088 and is referenced to hereinafter
simply as the known device. In said known device, a
cylindrical portion is rigidly coupled to the frustum-shaped
braking body at its 
smaller cross-section; said portion lies within the annular
gap of the skirt of a permanent magnet and is provided with
a coil that is supplied with the energization current,
which is modulated so as to match the variation in the
mechanical tension of the thread.This known configuration of the braking body provides
an effective modulated braking device but has some
constructive and functional drawbacks. The efficiency of
the device in terms of intensity of the braking action on
the thread in fact increases as the annular airspace of the
gap in which the coil moves decreases and as the intensity
of the current that concatenates with the flux of the
permanent magnet increases. Accordingly, it is necessary to
make a compromise between two contrasting requirements,
since reducing the gap airspace entails the adoption of
coils formed with thin conductors, and this limits the
intensity of the current that circulates in the coil and
ultimately limits the electrodynamic action applied to
