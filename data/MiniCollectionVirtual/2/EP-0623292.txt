<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to helmets, and especially to helmets designed to carry 
equipment forming part of a head-up display system. Such systems normally 
incorporate an optical unit arranged to display to an observer an image of display 
material superimposed on a direct view of the surroundings, and are commonly used 
in aircraft, the display material being, for example, instrument readings, radar 
presentations, maps or possibly an intensified image of the scene viewed by the 
observer, as well as other information. In the case of helmet mounted displays the display equipment carried by the 
helmet can be bulky and somewhat heavy, which could make the helmet 
uncomfortable for the wearer. An object of the invention is to provide means of alleviating this problem, 
although the invention has other advantages as will be apparent from the following 
description. Moreover the invention is not restricted to use with helmets forming part 
of helmet mounted displays but could have application to helmets employed for other 
purposes. According to the invention in its broadest aspect a helmet comprises a helmet 
shell, and a suspension arrangement for supporting the helmet shell on a wearer's 
head, the suspension arrangement comprising a light-weight relatively stiff ring, having 
an internal surface which is matched to, so as to fit closely around, the wearer's head, 
and an external surface which engages a co-operating part of the surface of the  
 
helmet shell, and means for detachably securing the ring to the shell. The ring is preferably formed of expanded polystyrene or polypropylene or 
similar low density plastics material, and conveniently carries on its internal surface 
a layer of soft padding material, for example a foam rubber or plastics material, to 
form a cushion against the wearer's head may be accomplished either by custom 
trimming the inner surface of a common ring blank, or by selection from a number of 
differently sized rings. By arranging for the ring, which may be termed a form fitting ring, to be 
detachably secured to the helmet shell, a ring individual to a particular wearer may be 
attached to any helmet shell he is required to wear. Conversely, any one helmet 
shell may be used by any individual wearer by fitting that wearer's ring in the helmet 
shell. The ring may be secured to the helmet shell by means of a hook and loop 
fastener system, that is to say a fastening system as commonly known under the trade 
name Velcro, although other forms of releasable securing means may

<CLAIMS>
A helmet comprising a helmet shell (3), and a suspension arrangement for 
supporting the helmet shell (3) on a wearer's head (2) characterised in that the 

suspension arrangement comprises a light-weight relatively stiff ring (1), having an 
internal surface which is matched to, so as to fit closely around, the wearer's head (2), 

and an external surface which engages a co-operating part of the surface of the 
helmet shell (3), and means (12, 13) for detachably securing the ring (1) to the shell 

(3). 
A helmet according to Claim 1 wherein the ring (1) is formed of a low density 
plastics material. 
A helmet according to Claim 2 wherein the ring (1) is formed of expanded 
polystyrene or polypropylene. 
A helmet according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the ring (1) 
carries on its internal surface a layer of a soft padding material (11) to form a cushion 

against the wearer's head. 
A helmet according to Claim 4 wherein the padding material (11) is a foam 
rubber or plastics material. 
A helmet according to any one of the preceding claims wherein said means (12, 
13) for securing comprises a hook and loop fastener system (12, 13). 
A helmet according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the ring (1) has 
fitted to it a suspension means (4) of a flexible material which fits over the top of the 

wearer's head (2). 
A helmet according to Claim 7 wherein the suspension means (4) incorporates 

means (6) for adjustment of the size of the suspension means (4), to provide height 
adjustment for the ring (1) and consequently the helmet. 
A helmet according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the ring (1) 
supports ear cups (8) for accommodating earpieces of an intercommunication/radio 

equipment. 
A helmet according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the ring (1) 
supports a nape pad (7). 
A helmet according to Claim 9 or Claim 10 incorporating means (9, 10) for 
adjusting the position of said ear cups (8) and/or nape pad (7) to suit the wearer. 
A suspension arrangement for supporting a shell (3) of a helmet on a wearer's 
 

head (2) comprising a light weight relatively stiff ring (1) having an internal surface 
matched to, so as to fit closely around the wearer's head (2), and an external surface 

shaped to engage and arranged to be detachably secured to a part of the internal 
surface of the helmet shell(3). 
A method of adapting a helmet to fit a particular wearer's head (2) comprising 
providing a light-weight relatively stiff ring (1) having an internal surface matched to, 

so as to fit closely around, that particular wearer's head (2), and detachably securing 
the ring within the helmet. 
A method according to Claim 13 wherein matching of the internal surface of the 
ring (11) to the head (2) of the particular wearer is accomplished by custom trimming 

the inner surface of a common ring blank. 
A system according to Claim 13 wherein matching of the internal surface of the 
ring (1) to the head (2) of the particular wearer is accomplished by selection from a 

number of differently sized rings. 
A method according to any one of Claims 13 to 15 wherein the ring (1) is 
formed of a plastics material. 
A method according to Claim 16 wherein the ring is formed of expanded 
polystyrene or polypropylene.
