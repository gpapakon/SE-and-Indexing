<ABSTRACT>
A composite, non-electrically conductive, non-sparking, 
non-magnetic and lightweight cutter/plier hand tool has two 

pivotally interconnected lever members, each of unitary, 
one-piece construction and formed by compression molding of 

multiple plies of a discontinuous random glass fiber-reinforced 
plastic sheet molding compound. Fixed to the jaw 

of each lever member is a ceramic insert made of 
transformation toughened zirconia, formed by dry compression 

and then sintering of a powdered form of the ceramic 
material. Each insert has a serrated gripping portion and a 

cutting portion, with cutting surfaces on the opposed 
inserts operating in shearing relationship. Three versions 

of the inserts are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plier/cutter hand tools,
in particular, to
tools such as lineman's tools which are designed for use in
applications where they may be exposed to high electrical
voltage or current.It is important in certain electrical applications that
hand tools, such as pliers, cutters and the like, be
electrically non-conductive to protect the user from
electrical shock and to prevent short circuitry of
electrical circuits. It is well known to provide
electrically insulating sheaths or coatings on the handles
of such tools, but such coatings provide limited electrical
protection, being unsuitable for use in very high-voltage or
high-current environments, such as may be encountered by an
electrical utility lineman. Furthermore, such sheathing or
coating can be degraded by cutting, scratching and the like,
which seriously impairs its electrical insulating
efficiency.It is known to provide hand tools with handle portions
formed entirely of electrically non-conductive or insulating
materials, such as plastics and the like. Such tools have
worked effectively in protecting the user from shock
resulting from electrical conductivity through the handle.
However, it has been typically necessary that the working
portions, such as the jaws of pliers, cutters and the like,
be formed of metal in order to provide the requisite
strength, hardness and toughness for the particular tool
application. Such metal working parts are subject to
sparking and/or to magnetization, which renders them
unsuitable for certain applications.Another difficulty with cutter tools is that the
cutting edges tend to wear and dull with use, necessitating
reconditioning. It is known to provide hand tools such as 
pliers, cutters and the like, with replaceable metal jaw
inserts, but this does not avoid the sparking and
magnetization problem.Various types of cutting tools have been provided
heretofore with blades formed of material, such as ceramic,
which has excellent wear-resistance characteristics.
However, most ceramic materials are less tenacious than
metals and have a tendency to chip or crack and, because of
their hardness, once chipped, they are difficult to
recondition. Furthermore, previous attempts at ceramic
cutter design have proved to be difficult and expensive,
since cutting edge and platen designs cannot be molded
directly and require expensive machining.US-A-4023450 discloses pliers made from a plastic
material which is preferably reinforced with glass fibers,
the pliers including crossed levers with handles on
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A non-electrically conductive and non-sparking
pivoting plier/cutter hand tool including first and second

lever members (21, 21A) respectively having cooperating jaws
(30, 30A) at adjacent ends thereof and each formed entirely

of plastic material, a pivot mechanism (50) having no
exposed metallic portions pivotally interconnecting said

lever members in intersecting relationship for pivotal
movement between open and closed conditions of said jaws,

and first and second ceramic inserts (40, 40A) respectively
fixedly secured to said jaws in opposed relationship,

each of said inserts having a serrated
gripping portion (44) and a cutting surface (49, 49A; 73,

74, 78, 79), said cutting surfaces being substantially
parallel and disposed for movement in shearing relationship

with each other when said jaws are moved from the open to
the closed condition thereof.
The hand tool of claim 1, wherein each of said
lever members is formed of a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic

material.
The hand tool of claim 1, wherein said inserts are
respectively adhesively secured to said jaws.
The hand tool of claim 1, wherein each of said
inserts is formed of transformation toughened zirconia

(TTZ).
The hand tool of claim 5, wherein said TTZ is
partially stabilized with magnesia.
The hand tool of claim 1, wherein each of said
inserts has a retaining surface (67; 71, 76) disposed

substantially perpendicular to the associated cutting
surface and intersecting same at a cutting edge.
The hand tool of claim 6, wherein said retaining
surface (47, 47A) is disposed at an acute angle with respect

the associated cutting surface.
The hand tool of claim 1, wherein one of said
inserts (75) has a groove (77) formed therein substantially

rectangular in transverse cross section and defining a pair 
of substantially parallel first cutting surfaces (78, 79),

the other of said inserts (70) having a tongue (72)
projecting therefrom substantially rectangular in transverse

cross section and defining a pair of substantially parallel
second cutting surfaces (73, 74), said tongue being

receivable in said groove for movement of said first and
second cutting surfaces in shearing relationship with each

other when said jaws are moved from the open to the closed
condition thereof.
A method of making the non-electrically conductive
and non-sparking pivoting plier/cutter hand tool of claim 1 comprising

the steps of: molding two composite plastic lever members
(21, 21A) each having a jaw (30, 30A) at one end thereof,

the molding of each lever member including preparing a mold
charge (82) of a congruent stack of a plurality of layers

(83) of glass fiber reinforced plastic sheet material each
having the general shape of the outline of the lever member,

and subjecting the mold charge to heat and pressure in a
compression molding apparatus (80, 85) for a predetermined

period of time; making two jaw inserts (40, 40A), the making
of each insert including dry compressing a powdered ceramic

material (92) in a die cavity (91) to form a body in the
shape of the outline of the insert, and sintering the

pressed ceramic body; fixedly securing the inserts
respectively to the jaws of the lever members; and then

pivotally interconnecting the lever members in intersecting
relationship for pivotal movement between opened and closed

conditions of the jaws with the inserts in opposed
relationship.
