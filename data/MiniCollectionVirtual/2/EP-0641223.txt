<ABSTRACT>
A living skin replacement for the treatment of partial- and full-thickness skin injuries, such as burns and other wounds, consists of a slurry of cell-coated microspheres which can be applied to the skin injury in much the same manner as a paste or salve. The skin implant can accommodate contour variations across the often extensive area of a skin injury and does not require the use of stapling, suturing, or other attachment methods. The microspheres can be formed of a variety of materials that are biocompatible and resorbable in vivo.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of tissue
implants and more particularly to the application of skin
implants for the treatment of full- and partial-thickness skin
injuries, such as burns and other wounds.Full-thickness and partial-thickness skin injuries,
such as burns and other wounds, represent a significant cost
to health care systems. For example, about 2 million people
in North America suffer from burns each year. Of these about
200,000 people are hospitalized, 15,000 of which die of burn-related
causes. The overall hospital cost for treating these
patients is in the order of $1000/percentage burned area
($U.S., 1992) so that the average burn patient with burns to
20 to 30% of their body generates initial hospital care costs
of about $25,000, not including the cost of further treatment
and potential loss of productivity and income. For instance,
McMillan etal (J Burn Care Rehab 6:444-446; 1985) have
demonstrated that operating room expenses increase
logarithmically with the percent of body surface area burned.
Clearly, there is a requirement for advances in technology to
mitigate these costs and to reduce the suffering of the
patients.Skin consists of a dermal layer which underlies an
epidermal layer. The dermal layer consists mostly of
fibroblasts and is about five times the thickness of the
epidermal layer. The epidermal layer of intact skin,
consisting mainly of keratinocytes and immune cells such as
dendritic Langerhans cells, normally prevents water loss and
microbial invasion, so that full- and partial-thickness skin
injuries can be life-threatening. The rate of wound closure
to prevent the escape of essential body fluids and the invasion
of bacteria is therefore a vital factor in the recovery of the
patient. Accordingly a wide array of wound coverings has been
developed to expedite wound closure. An existing treatment of burns and wounds includes
the use of the patient's own skin, or cadaver- or porcine-derived
tissue for grafting onto the wound of the patient.
Traditional patient-derived skin graft (autograft) techniques
are generally very painful to the patient who is already
suffering from the burn or other wound. An autograft is
comprised of a substantial thickness of both the epidermal and
dermal layers of the skin taken from another site on the body.
In an attempt to limit the amount of skin taken and therefore
the size of the new wound, the autograft is treated to form a
lattice pattern across the skin injury. However, the lattice
pattern in the dermis layer of the
