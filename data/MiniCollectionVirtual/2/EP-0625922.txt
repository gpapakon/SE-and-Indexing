A process for the spray-drying and/or fluidized-bed 
drying of water-containing useful materials or mixtures of 

useful materials, which are suitable for use as and/or in 
wetting agents, detergents and/or cleaning products and 

which may even be present as agueous preparations, using 
superheated steam as the drying gas which is recycled to 

the drying stage after removal of the evaporated water, 
characterized in that, to obtain a high-quality and, in 

particular, light-coloured dry material and/or one free 
from carbonate deposits, the energy required for the 

evaporation of water is supplied to the circulating steam 
at least by far predominantly by indirect heat exchange; in 

the case of spray drying, this introduction of energy takes 
place at least predominantly outside the drying zone 

whereas, in the case of fluidized bed drying, heat-exchange 
surfaces integrated into the fluidized bed may also be 

used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the steam-filled system operates under internal pressures 

around normal pressure, but preferably under such elevated 
pressures that air is prevented from entering the system, 

for example in damaged areas, excess pressures below about 
50 mbar being preferred. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that fluid and sprayable aqueous solutions, emulsions 

and/or suspensions of the useful materials or mixtures of 
useful materials are subjected to spray drying with the 

circulating steam. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the temperature of the gas circulation phase is 

kept at a value in the range from about 100 to 450°C and 
preferably at a value in the range from about 115 to 350°C. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the steam leaves the spray drying zone with temperatures  

 
of at least 150°C and preferably with temperatures 

of at least about 180°C. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that drying of the particulate material is terminated 

before it is endangered by heat, the long-term pourability 
and free flow of the material thus partly dried being 

established if necessary by addition of mixture constituents 
which are capable of binding limited quantities of 

water and/or by an aftertreatment to homogenize the residual 
moisture content in the particulate material and/or 

by after-drying of the particulate material under conditions 
which do not affect the useful material. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized 

in that aqueous preparations of water-soluble and/or insoluble 
organic and/or inorganic useful materials from wetting 

agents, detergents and/or cleaning products, such as surfactants 
and emulsifiers, inorganic and/or organic builders 

or builder components, washing alkalis, fillers or neutral 
salts, fabric softeners, bleach activators, auxiliaries for 

improving soil suspending power, such as redeposition 
inhibitors and abrasives, are subjected to the process. 
A process as claimed in claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that auxiliaries in the form of particulate solids which 

are capable of fixing water, for example by binding as 
water of crystallization or by absorptive binding, are used 

to bind the residual water and, in one embodiment, are used 
in quantities at least sufficient to ensure the pourability 

and storability of the dry material. 
A process as claimed in claims 6 to 8, characterized 
in that the auxiliaries used to bind the residual water are 

at least partly and preferably at least predominantly added 
to the aqueous preparations of useful material before they 

are dried with superheated steam. 
A process as claimed in claims 6 to 9, characterized 
in that the auxiliaries used to bind residual water are  

 
useful materials from the field of wetting agents, detergents 

and/or cleaning products, for example inorganic 
useful materials which bind water of crystallization from 

the classes of builder components, washing alkalis and/or 
fillers, or organic useful materials capable of absorptively 

binding water. 
A process as claimed in claims 6 to 10, characterized 
in that a material containing residual water from the spray 

drying process with superheated steam is subjected to an at 
least one-stage aftertreatment which results in homogenization 

of the residual moisture in the material initially 
accumulating and removed from the spray drying zone and/or 

which is carried out in the form of after-drying, the 
aftertreatments preferably being carried out in fluidized 

beds which in turn are operated with superheated steam as 
the hot gas stream. 
A process as claimed in claims 6 to 11, characterized 
in that the drying step with superheated steam is terminated 

at residual moisture contents of about 0.5 to 20% by 
weight and preferably of the order of 1 to 12% by weight 

and, more particularly, the content of free water which is 
not bound as water of crystallization is limited to values 

of at most about 10% by weight, based on the weight of the 
fine-particle material removed from the drying zone. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that individual components of organic or inorganic 

character selected as useful materials, preferably from the 
classes of surfactants or emulsifiers or builders or 

builder components, more particularly from the field of 
useful materials for laundry detergents, are obtained as 

the free-flowing dry material and may even be subjected to 
the process in the form of mixtures with water-soluble 

salts capable of binding water of crystallization for 
ensuring pourability and storability and/or adjusting 

apparent density.  
 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 13, characterized 
in that mixtures of useful materials for the production of 

laundry detergents, which preferably contain surfactants 
together with builders or builder components and optionally 

washing alkalis and/or neutral salts, are dried. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 14, characterized 
in that superheated steam with an entry temperature of at 

least about 200°C and preferably of, or above, 250°C is 
used as the hot gas stream in the drying zone. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 15, characterized 
in that the heat of condensation of the steam removed is at 

least partly recovered and the fractions of material 
removed are returned to the primary circuit at least 

substantially or practically free from waste gases and 
wastewater. 
The use of the process claimed in claims 1 to 16 for 
the production of free-flowing surfactant solids which are 

present in particular in admixture with soluble inorganic 
salts for ensuring free flow and/or apparent density. 
The use of the process claimed in claims 1 to 17 for 
the production of dried silicate-based useful materials 

which may be used in particular in laundry detergents and 
which comprise corresponding swellable and/or non-swellable 

representatives, such as layer silicates, for example bentonites, 
and/or zeolite compounds, more particularly detergent-quality 

zeolite NaA. 
The use of the process claimed in claims 1 to 18 for 
the production of laundry detergent heavy powders or 

granules to which temperature-sensitive and/or steam-volatile 
components are added for the production of the 

final laundry detergents.
