<ABSTRACT>
Method for obtaining injection-molded elements having 
a selected opacity or transparency. The method includes a 

first step for mixing a thermoplastic material, such as a 
polyurethane, a ionomeric resin or a EVA copolymer with 

colors that are preferably soluble in organic solvents, 
followed by a second step for the thermoplastic injection of 

the mixture into a mold. The method allows to obtain an 
injection-molded element having regions with different 

thickness that have different degrees of opacity or 
transparency. In particular, the thinner portions are 

transparent. The method thus provides products such as for 
example a flap (1) for a shoe in which it is possible to 

visualize underlying parts besides creating shading effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for obtaining 
injection-molded parts based on thermoplastic materials such 
as polyurethanes, ionomeric resins or EVA copolymers having 
a selected opacity or transparency. Currently, it is known to manufacture many products by 
using methods that entail the injection-molding of plastics, 
which is given a certain coloring to aesthetically improve 
the product or to allow to visually appreciate a certain 
function or application thereof. Thus, for example, it is known to manufacture sports 
shoes, and particularly ski boots, with a molding method for 
both the shell and any quarters or flaps associated 
therewith. The various components obtained by injection-molding a 
thermoplastic material usually have a preset coloring, and 
accessories such as levers, cables, bands, pressers and 
other items, used to improve the skier's comfort or 
performance, are added to said components at a later time. These accessories are usually fully or partially 
concealed in most cases and thus do not allow the user to 
assess their technical content. Furthermore, the uniform coloring of the various 
components of, for example, a shoe, severely limits the 
color differentiation thereof, making the various 
productions very similar to one another. As a partial solution to these drawbacks it is known to 
manufacture components for ski boots in which a seat is 
formed after or during a first molding operation. A  
 
transparent or semitransparent element, that allows to 
partially view the items that will be arranged below it, 
must subsequently be placed at said seat. However, this solution is expensive, because it is 
necessary to perform additional methods and because the 
applied element can be dislodged from its seat during sports 
practice. The optional fixing of these applied elements by means 
of adhesives has not proved to be risolutive. As a partial solution to this drawback, it may be 
thought of molding the applied element on the semifinished 
item, in which an appropriate seat has been formed 
beforehand. However, even this solution is expensive, because it 
requires two different molds and therefore subsequent 
assembly, increasing the overall costs of the product. A principal aim of the present invention is therefore 
to eliminate the described technical problems, solving the 
drawbacks of the prior art and thus providing a method for 
obtaining injection-molded elements based on thermoplastic 
materials, such as polyurethanes, ionomeric resins, or EVA 
copolymers

Method for obtaining injection-molded elements based 
on thermoplastic materials, such as polyurethanes, 

ionomeric resins, or EVA copolymers having a selected 
opacity or transparency, characterized in that it comprises: 


mixing said thermoplastic material with colors that are 
soluble in organic solvents or with previously dispersed 

organic pigments or with fluorescent pigments to obtain a 
mixture; 
injecting said mixture into at least one mold to obtain 
said injection-molded elements which have regions with 

different thickness, the thinner regions being transparent. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
it comprises: mixing said thermoplastic material with colors 

of the type that is soluble in organic solvents and 
therefore such as liquid colors obtained by dispersing 

anthraquinone colors in a plasticizing vehicle, said colors 
being commercially known by the trademark "LIQUI-KOLOR". 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said colors are constituted by fluorescent pigments in 

powder form such as Perylen or Naphtalimid, commercially 
known by the trademark "LUMOGEN". 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said colors are constituted by normal organic pigments, 

commercially known by the trademark "LIQUI-KOLOR", 
previously dispersed in liquids. 
Method according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that mixing said thermoplastic 

material with said colors entails percentages by weight that 
 

can vary between 0.01% and 1%. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
mixing said thermoplastic materials with said colors is 

performed with equipment normally used for injection-molding, 
such as screw mixers, drum rotators, or with 

peristaltic or volumetric pumps for direct dosage on 
injection presses. 
Method according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, in order to improve the 

dispersion of said colors in said thermoplastic material, 
especially if a small dosage percentage is used, said colors 

are diluted in a supporting vehicle prior to, or during, 
said mixing. 
Method according to claim 7, characterized in that

liquids or by "UV absorber" liquids such as a sterically 
hindered amine commercially known by the trademark "TINUVIN 

765".

the thermoplastic injection of said mixture into at least 
one mold, said mold being finished by polishing, sanding or 

photoengraving, said at least one mold having one or more 
regions with different thickness. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said injection-molded element has regions with different 

thickness in order to obtain first opaque regions, second 
semitransparent regions or third transparent regions in the

Method according to claim 10, characterized in that 
 

the transparency of said third regions is obtained by 
varying the thickness of said injection-molded element in a

Method according to claim 11, characterized in that 
by using decreasing or tapered cross-sections for said 

injection-molded element one obtains effects ranging from an 
almost opaque or fully opaque tint for said first regions, 

which have a significant thickness, to said second
