<DESCRIPTION>
 PYRROLO( 1 ,2-B)-( 1 ,2)-BENZ0THIAZIN-10-0NE AND ITS USE AS AN ANTIMICROBIALBackground of the Invention This invention relates to the compound pyrrolo-(1,2-b)-(1,2)-benzothiazin-10-one and its use as an antimicrobial agent.US-A-3492299 discloses the preparation of compounds of the formula:wherein R is ethyl and n is 2 or 3. These compounds are disclosed as being useful as ultra-violet light absorbers.The desirability of identifying or discovering new antimicrobial agents is widely recognized. New antimicrobial agents are desired for several reasons; these include, but are not limited to, responding to the problem created by the development of microbe strains resistant to known antimicrobials, the occurrence of undesirable interactions of certain known antimicrobials with the medium or product in which the antimicrobial is used, and high toxicity of certain known antimicrobials to certain non-target organisms such as mammals.The present invention solves these problems by disclosing a new compound which may be employed as an antimicrobial. Summary of the InventionThe present invention is directed to the compound pyrrolo-(1 ,2-b)-(1 ,2)-benzothiazin-10-one which corresponds to the formula:The present invention is also directed to an antimicrobial composition comprising an antimicrobially-effective amount of the compound 

pyrrolo-(1 ,2-b)-(1,2)-benzothiazin-10-one, as the active material, in intimate admixture with an inert diluent.The present invention is further directed to a method for inhibiting microorganisms in a microbial habitat which comprises contacting said microbial habitat with an antimicrobial composition comprising an antimicrobially-effective amount of the compound pyrrolo-(1 ,2-b)-(1 ,2)-benzothiazin-10-one, as the active material, in intimate admixture with an inert diluent.In addition, the present invention is directed to the use of pyrrolo-(1 ,2-b)-(1,2)-benzothiazin-10-one as a microorganism inhibitor. Detailed Description of InventionThe compound of the present invention, pyrrolo-(1 ,2-b)-(1 ,2)benzothiazin-10-one, corresponds to the formula:and ma be prepared by the following general reaction sequence:In a first step, 2-(2-ethylthio)benzoyl pyrrole is prepared by reacting ethyl 2-(ethylthio)benzoate and chloromagnesium pyrrole. See, for example, the general procedure of K. C. Nicolaou et al. . Org. Chem., 1985, 50, p. 1440-1456. The ethyl 2-(ethylthio)benzoate reactant is known in the art and can be prepared by procedures such as taught in S. Oae and T. Naurata, Tetrahedron, 1974,
