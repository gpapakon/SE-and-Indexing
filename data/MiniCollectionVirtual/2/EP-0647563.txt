<ABSTRACT>
The sealing machine comprises at least one taping device 
(11) comprising a unit (17) for supporting a roll (14) of tape 

(13) of adhesive paper, a unit (21) for feeding the tape (13) 
and a contrasting unit (22) co-operating with the unit (21) 

feeding the tape (13); the machine also comprises sensor means 
(M1, M2) for the activation and disactivation of the feeder 

unit (21) and of the contrasting unit (22). The roll (14) is 
mounted in the supporting unit (17) in a freely rotatable 

manner so that, following the activation and subsequent 
disactivation of the feeder unit (21) and of the contrasting 

unit (22) for unwinding the initial section (T) of the tape 
(13) from the roll (14), the roll (14) continues its rotation 

due to inertia so as to obtain, between the supporting unit 
(17) and the feeder unit (21), a section (205) of loose tape 

that is subsequently recalled by the advancing box (3) without 
opposing any resistance, said supporting unit (17) also 

comprising braking means (98, 95) controlled by said sensor 
means (M1, M2) to stop the inertial rotation of the roll (14) 

of tape (13) when the operation of sealing a box (3) has been 
completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adhesive paper sealing 
machine for parallelepiped boxes with turn-down flaps. It is known that ecological problems have caused a return to 
favour of adhesive paper sealing tapes (paper tapes provided 
with a small layer of adhesive applied to one of the faces), 
that for years had been abandoned in favour of plastic adhesive 
tapes. In the European patent application No. 0558122 a sealing 
machine was described using an adhesive paper taping device 
that comprises a plurality of individual separately dismantable 
units, among which a unit for supporting a roll of adhesive 
paper tape, units for controlling, centering and feeding the 
tape itself, a contrasting unit co-operating with the feeder 
unit, a unit for shearing and a unit for moistening the tape, 
and lastly a unit for applying the tape to the top of the box 
to be sealed. A similar taping device can also be provided for 
sealing the bottom of the box. During the operation of such a machine, a box to be sealed 
is made to advance by a pair of lateral belts along a set of 
rollers, and it presses in sequence a first and a second 
microswitch.  
 The operation of the first microswitch determines the 
operation of the tape feeder unit of each taping device, that 
causes the tape itself to advance, unwinding it from the roll, 
by an amount of a predetermined length; during the tape 
advance, its surface provided with glue is made to become 
adhesive through the action of the moistening unit, so that, 
when the box arrives, it can glue itself on the front surface 
of the same box, by exploiting the pressure of a roller forming 
part of the tape application unit. The further advance of the 
box determines the operation of the second microswitch, that 
releases the movement of the tape inside the machine, so that 
the advance of the box causes the free unwinding of the tape 
from the roll, to allow the tape to be glued on the upper 
surface of the box and possibly also the lower one. At the end 
the tape is sheared off, and the machine is ready to start a 
new cycle. The problem exhibited by the described machine is linked 
with the fact that, especially with tapes whose adhesive is of 
poor quality, the resistance offered to the action of unwinding 
the tape could, during the advancement of the box, cause the 
section of the tape that is not yet perfectly glued on the 
front surface to come unstuck, determining the failure of the 
entire sealing operation. In view of the described state of the art, the object of

respect to said supporting base (1) and at least one taping 

device (11) supported by said head (8) and comprising a unit 
(17) for supporting a roll (14) of tape (13) of adhesive paper, 

a unit (21) for feeding the tape (13), a contrasting unit (22) 
serving to determine the intermittent advancement of the tape in 

relation to the operating cycle 
co-operating with the unit (21) feeding the tape (13), a unit 

(23) for shearing the tape (13), a unit (24) for moistening the 
tape (13) and a unit (25) for applying the moistened tape (13) 

on the box (3) to be sealed, said machine also comprising

the supporting unit (17) in a freely rotatable manner so that, 
following the activation and subsequent disactivation of the 

feeder unit (21) and of the contrasting unit (22) for unwinding 
the initial section (T) of the tape (13) from the roll (14), 

the roll (14) continues its rotation due to inertia so as to
