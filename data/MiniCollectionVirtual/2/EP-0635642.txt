<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a blower unit with an electric drive for use in a vacuum cleaner, with the combination of the following, partially known features:   1) the drive consists of an electromagnetic stator (3) and of an electromagnetically active compressor impeller (1) with a radial air gap between the stator (3) and the compressor impeller (1), 2) the compressor impeller (1) has, at the air gap, a conductive baseplate (7) which carries the fan blades (9) on the radial face remote from the air gap and of which the radial face (8) confronting the air gap is located opposite the stator poles (18) at the air gap (11), 3) the stator poles (18) adjacent to the air gap (11) and located opposite the radial face (8) are worked out from a radial end face (12) of an iron sleeve (15) by the provision of radially fashioned grooves (17), into which coils (20) are wound, 4) the drive acting as axial-flow motor (4) is fed by means of a frequency converter (29), the rotational-speed setting being derived from process-dependent desired values and adjustable regulating quantities.

<CLAIMS>
An electrically driven fan unit for use in a vacuum cleaner, characterised 
in that 


1.) the driving mechanism is composed of an electromagnetic stator (3) and an 
electromagnetically active impeller wheel (1) having a radial air gap between 

the stator (3) and the impeller wheel (1), 
2) the impeller wheel (1) has a conductive basic disc (7, 13) adjacent the air gap, 
which basic disc carries the impeller vanes (9) at the side of the radial surface 

facing away from said air gap and is situated opposite the stator poles (18) at 
the side of the radial surface (8) facing the air gap (11), 
3) the stator poles (18) which are adjacent the air gap (11) and opposite the radial 
surface (8) are formed from a radial end face (15) of an iron cylinder by the 

provision of radial slots (17) in which coils (20) are arranged, 
4) the axial-flow motor (4) which serves as the driving mechanism is energised by 
means of a frequency changer (29), the speed setting being derived from 

process-dependent nominal values and adjustable set-point values. 
A fan unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the set-point 
values are the primary frequency and the stator current or the stator voltage. 
A fan unit as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the actual speed 
value is a measurement value or is derived from electrical parameters. 
A fan unit as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that, 
the operating speed of the turbine wheel is set at 25,000 - 50,000 r.p.m.
