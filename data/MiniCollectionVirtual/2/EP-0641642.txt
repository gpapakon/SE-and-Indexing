<ABSTRACT>
The procedure, comprising the application of laths (8) and a resin-based laminated material, uses a mould in two complementary sections (3, 10), fitting the laths onto the first section (3) and the laminated material to the second section (10), after which they are pressed together in a vacuum formed between one section (10) of the mould and a layer of impermeable film material (4) covering the other, the film being joined and sealed to the edge of the second mould section (10). The laths (8) are made from a relatively supple material, such as wood, fitted on top of a model (3) which forms the first section of the mould and is equipped with guides (9) for lugs (9') on the second section. The film layer can be of an elastic material.
