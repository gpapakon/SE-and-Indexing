<ABSTRACT>
The method of the invention is applied to a signal with a plurality of phases which consists of two data trains in phase quadrature supplying, at each symbol time, a received sample the position of which in the constellation is defined by its coordinates (In, Qn) obtained by quantisation of these data trains. It consists in:   - determining the number of received samples, called erroneous samples, during a defined time interval, the coordinates of which correspond to those of specimen samples, the coordinates of the specimen samples being different from those of samples received in optimal transmission conditions, called optimal samples; - calculating the ratio between the number of erroneous samples and the total number of samples received during this defined time interval, this calculated ratio being inversely proportional to Eb/No.

Process of determining the ratio of the energy per bit to the noise spectral density
Eb/No of a digital transmission, said process being applied to a signal having a

plurality of phases made up of two data streams in phase quadrature providing
in each symbol time (Ts) a received sample whose position in the constellation is

defined by its coordinates (In, Qn) obtained by quantizing said data streams
(I, Q), characterized in that the process consists in:


determining the number of erroneous samples received (NBEE) during a given
time period whose coordinates correspond to those of indicative samples, the

coordinates of said indicative samples being different from those of optimum
samples received under optimum transmission conditions; and
calculating the ratio between said number of erroneous samples (NBEE) and
the total number of samples received (NBET) in said given time period, the

calculated ratio being inversely proportional to the Eb/No ratio.
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that said indicative samples form
collection areas (30 through 34), one of said collection areas (30) being situated

at the centre of said constellation, the other collection areas (31 through 34)
each being between two of said optimum samples, and in that said calculated

ratio crossing a predetermined threshold value (REF) generates an alarm signal
(ALARM) indicative of carrier frequency loss.
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that said indicative samples form a
single collection area (30) at the centre of said constellation and in that said

calculated ratio crossing a predetermined threshold value (REF) generates an
alarm signal (ALARM) indicative of remote carrier frequency loss.
Process according to claim 1 characterized in that said indicative samples are all
the samples of said constellation with the exception of said optimum samples.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 4 characterized in that it is applied to a
phase modulated (MDP-M) signal with M = 2, 4, 8 or more phase states.
