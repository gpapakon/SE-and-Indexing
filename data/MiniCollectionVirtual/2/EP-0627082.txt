<ABSTRACT>
A method for antenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities in which maternal blood from a pregnant woman is measured for levels of free beta hCG and at least a second serum marker and/or precursors and metabolites of these markers and the measured levels of these markers together with the gestational age of the pregnant woman are compared to reference values at various gestational ages of the levels for free beta hCG and the second serum marker in (a) pregnant women carrying foetuses having the abnormalitie(s) subject to the screen and (b) pregnant women carrying normal foetuses, the comparison being indicative of the risk of the pregnant woman carrying a foetus with an abnormality subject to the screen characterized in that the second serum marker is pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPPA) and the screen is carried out by the end of the thirteenth (13th) completed week of pregnancy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for antenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities and in particular to a method for antenatal screening for Down's Syndrome.The risk of Down's Syndrome and some other chromosomal abnormalities in a foetus is known to increase with the age of the mother and it is this knowledge which forms the basis for selection of pregnant women for further investigation. Further investigation for instance in the case of Down's Syndrome involves sampling of the amniotic fluid by amniocentesis, a procedure which itself carries a risk for the mother of the foetus, induction of a miscarriage being a recognised hazard of this procedure.Maternal serum markers for Down's Syndrome are widely used for antenatal screening for this chromosomal abnormality,the most common of these markers being alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) - either the intact molecule thereof or its beta subunit - and unconjugated estriol (uE). Disclosures relating to the use of these markers in antenatal screening for Down's Syndrome include US Patent 4,874,693, WO 89/00696 and WO 90/08325. US Patent 5,100,806 discloses the use of the beta subunit of hCG as a marker in antenatal screening for Edwards Syndrome.Maternal serum screening is based on selecting a subgroup of women who are at the greatest risk of giving birth to a child with an abnormality, in whom the risks of an invasive diagnostic procedure are considered to be outweighed by the risk of the abnormality. The risk is calculated by multiplying the a priori age related risk by the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is calculated from the relative heights of the multivariate Gaussian distribution functions of marker analytes in affected and unaffected pregnancies, corresponding to the value of the individual serum marker concentrations.Since the concentrations of the various analytes vary normally with gestational age, the analyte concentrations must be corrected. Correction is performed by dividing the concentration of the analyte by the median concentration expected for that particular gestational age in women with unaffected pregnancies. This is termed the multiple of the median (MoM).The use of two or more markers together in antenatal screening can be advantageous. For example the markers AFP, hCG and uE can be used together. The combination of marker analytes gives significantly more information than is given by any single marker alone, or by the group of markers when used sequentially. The use of likelihood ratios derived

<CLAIMS>
A method for antenatal screening for a chromosomal abnormality in a foetus, comprising:

(A) calculating a pregnant woman's 
a priori
 age-related risk of carrying a foetus having said chromosomal abnormality,
(B) measuring said pregnant woman's blood by the end of the thirteenth (13th) completed week of pregnancy for a concentration of free beta hCG, its precursors and metabolites,
(C) measuring said pregnant woman's blood by the end of the thirteenth (13th) completed week of pregnancy for a concentration of pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), its precursors and metabolites,
(D) calculating a normalized value for each of said concentrations from steps (B) and (C) by dividing said concentrations by a median value found in a population of women with unaffected pregnancies and same gestational age as said pregnant woman,
(E) calculating a first probability that the normalized values are part of a bivariate Gaussian distribution of values found in pregnancies with said chromosomal abnormality,
(F) calculating a second probability that the normalized values are a part of a bivariate Gaussian distribution of values found in unaffected pregnancies,
(G) calculating a likelihood ratio, said likelihood ratio being the ratio of said first probability and said second probability, and
(H) modifying the 
a priori
 age-related risk by the likelihood ratio.
The method of claim 1 wherein the chromosomal abnormality is Down's Syndrome.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the chromosomal abnormality is selected from the group consisting of Edward's Syndrome, Pateaus Syndrome, Turner Syndrome, Monosomy X and Kleinefelter's Syndrome, and any combination thereof.
