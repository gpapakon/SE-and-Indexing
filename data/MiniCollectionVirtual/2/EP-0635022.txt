A process for preparing alkyl glycosides by 
reaction of aqueous glycoses having a water content of 

10 - 80% by weight with aliphatic primary alcohols having 
from 8 to 30 C atoms, which comprises 


(a) employing the alcohols and the glycoses in a molar 
ratio of 2:1 - 10:1, 
(b) using 0.1 - 5% by weight, based on the amount of the 
glycoses employed, of the acidic form of an anionic 

surfactant as the acidic catalyst having emulsifying 
properties, 
(c) using 1 - 30% by weight, based on the amount of the 
glycoses employed, of alkyl glycosides as a further 

emulsifier, 
(d) preheating the aqueous glycose to 50 - 90°C and 
metering the preheated aqueous solution of the 

glycose with effective mixing into the reaction 
mixture of alcohol, acidic catalyst and emulsifier 

in such a manner that an emulsion is formed, 
(e) carrying out the reaction in emulsion at from 100 to 
150°C and from 10 to 100 mbar, the water introduced 

into the reaction mixture and the water formed by 
the reaction being continuously removed by distillation, 
(f) after the reaction has ended, neutralizing the 
acidic catalyst by addition of a base such that the 

resulting mixture has a pH of 8 - 10, then 
(g) removing the excess alcohol by distillation at from 
0.01 to 10 mbar down to a residual content of less 

than 5% by weight, based on the amount of alkyl 
glycoside present, and  

 
(h) bleaching the reaction mixture at pH 8 - 10, after 
conversion into an aqueous paste having a content of 

30 - 70% by weight of alkyl glycoside, using a 
compound eliminating active oxygen. 
A process for preparing alkyl glycosides as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein the aqueous glycose employed 

is a solution which mainly contains glucose as the 
glycose. 
A process for preparing alkyl glycosides as 
claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the alcohols employed 

are aliphatic primary alcohols having from 8 to 
20 C atoms. 
A process for preparing alkyl glycosides as 
claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the acidic 

catalysts used are alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, alkylsulfonic 
acids, sulfosuccinic acid mono- and diesters, 

sulfoalkylcarboxylic acids and -carboxylic acid esters 
and also mono- and dialkylnaphthalenesulfonic acids.
