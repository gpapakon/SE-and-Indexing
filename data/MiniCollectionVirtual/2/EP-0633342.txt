<ABSTRACT>
A method for automatically optimizing the use of detergent in a 
washing machine, washing-drying machine, dishwasher or the like 

comprising a usual detergent container or drawer (35), said method 
consisting of monitoring, at least at the commencement of a 

machine wash cycle, the conductivity of the water entering the 
machine and hence its hardness, and on the basis of this feeding a 

suitable quantity of detergent into the wash tub or environment, 
this quantity being proportional at least to the measured water 

hardness. A device for implementing the aforesaid method 
comprises water conductivity measurement means (1) connected to 

means (3) for evaluating the measured conductivity value and which 
control selector means (30) for feeding a suitable quantity of 

detergent into the wash tub or environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a washing domestic appliance,
i.e. washing machine, washing-drying machine, dishwasher
or the like, which automatically optimizes the use of
detergent by measuring the hardness of the wash water.
Hardness is known to be an intrinsic characteristic of
water and is due mainly to the presence of magnesium and
calcium salts. In general, using a given detergent in
said machine, the harder the water (i.e. its richness in
said salts) the lesser the washing efficiency of the
detergent.US-A-3 223 108 discloses a washing machine with three
sensing cells. The detergent quantity can be
automatically adjusted according to water hardness. The
control system used in such machine is a feedback system
in which one of the three cells senses the conductivity
of the washing solution with consequent problems in term
of contamination of the cell.An object of the invention is to provide a washing
domestic appliance in which the automatic optimization of
detergent on the basis of the particular hardness of the
wash water is highly reliable with time.A further object is to provide a washing domestic
appliance which is of simple construction and low cost.
These and further objects which will be apparent to the
expert of the art are attained by a washing domestic
appliance in accordance with the appended claims. The present invention will be apparent from the accompanying
drawing, which is provided by way of non-limiting example and in
which:
Figure 1 is a block diagram of the device of the present
invention; Figure 2 is a circuit scheme of part of the device of the
invention, this scheme comprising usual electrical and/or
electronic components which are of clear understanding to the
expert of the art and are hence not described in detail; andFigure 3 is a front view of part of the scheme of Figure 2 when
implemented.With reference to said figures, the device of the invention
comprises a conductivity sensor 1 positioned in a pipe 2 through
which water enters the tub for example of a washing machine (not
shown). The sensor is associated with a unit 3 for evaluating the
conductivity measured by the sensor 1. For this purpose, the
evaluation unit 3 cooperates with a memory 4 containing
conductivity reference values. The unit 3, which is connected to
the usual washing machine timer 5, controls the feed of detergent
into the said tub in a quantity proportional to the measured
conductivity value.More specifically, the sensor 1 is a conductivity cell and
measures the conductivity or impedance between two flat
