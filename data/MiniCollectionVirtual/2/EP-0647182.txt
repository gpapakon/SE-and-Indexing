<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a composite material comprising a
web shaped material, which is impregnated with curable resin
and which contains thermoplastic particles distributed in the
web shaped material. In addition, the invention relates to use
of such a composite material for producing laminates by warm
pressing and also a method for producing the composite material.It is known to produce a semi-manufacture of composite material
in a first operation and then, in a second operation, to
combine this with further material layers so as to achieve a
laminate in a pressing procedure. The thermoplastic particles
have been present in the semi-manufacture in expanded state,
and the resin has been present in B-stage. In this connection
it is to be pointed out that a curable resin, which is in
A-stage, is meltable, cross-linked to a small degree and
soluble in acetone and other solvents. A resin in C-stage is
unmeltable, entirely cross-linked and insoluble. The B-stage is
a stage between the A- and C-stages.On production of the semi-manufacture the web shaped material
is impregnated with the impregnation solution containing the
curable resin and the thermoplastic particles. The semi-manufacture
is thereafter obtained by heat processing so that the
same obtains the character of a foam composite material. This
semi-manufacture is then pressed into a laminate in a final
pressing operation. On the heat processing to obtain the foam
composite material, that means the semi-manufacture, 
substantially simultaneous expansion of the thermoplastic
particles and drying occur, which means that considerable
volumes of solvent are evaporated from the impregnated web
shaped material. Simultaneously there is also a change of the
curable resin from A-stage to B-stage. It has turned out that
the simultaneous emission of solvent and expansion of the
thermoplastic particles involve the disadvantage that it is
very difficult to achieve a good uniformity of the foam composite
material and, accordingly, also of the final laminate.
This is due to the fact that the expansion of the thermoplastic
particles causes a disturbance and an irregularity as far as
the solvent emission and the curing of the curable resin are
concerned. Furthermore, it has been found that this prior art
involves a great sensitivity to area weight variations since
such variations in turn give rise to variations in the degree
of curing of the curable resin. The simultaneous expansion of
the thermoplastic particles and the solvent emission may,
furthermore, give
