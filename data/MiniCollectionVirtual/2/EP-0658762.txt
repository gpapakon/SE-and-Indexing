<ABSTRACT>
An automatic clinical analyzer for measurement of electrolytes in a 
fluid sample comprising a flow cell (17) means (65) for passing a fluid 

sample through flow cell means (66,72;67,73;68,74) for different fluid 
sources (53,54,55) to be selectively reactive to the fluid sample 

passing through the flow cell thereby to permit sample analysis, wherein 
the internal referen
ce for the flow cell is a pH reference (26), and 
wherein a solution ground (93) is provided for the system, the solution 

ground being on a fluid line (27) from a fluid source, the fluid source 
being a diluent fluid.

these patent applications are filed contemporaneously 
with the present application and the contents of them 
all are incorporated by reference herein. This invention relates to the field of 
automatic analytical instruments. More particularly, 
the invention is concerned with automatic chemistry 
analyzer instruments for clinical use. In such  
 
instruments, there are sample carousels and sample 
handling systems. Different clinical analyzers for automatic 
chemistry analysis are known. One particular kind uses 
a plurality of individual analysis modules having open 
reactional sample cups. An automated sample probe 
withdraws sample fluid from samples in the reaction cup 
carried on a carousel. Selected volumes of the sample 
are distributed to analysis modules in accordance with 
the tests selected by the instrument operator. A different kind of analyser uses a flow cell 
through which diluent flows together with samples for 
determination of electrolytes in the fluid sample. 
Usually, four electrolytes, namely, sodium, potassium, 
chloride, and CO₂ are measured. In such analyzers, a 
pick-up probe extends vertically through a shear valve 
to aspirate the fluid sample from a sample cup aligned 
with the probe. The probe is withdrawn into the valve 
and the lower portion of the valve closes. Diluent 
from a diluent source flows into the valve, is mixed 
with the sample from the probe and flows to a flow 
analysis module. Each of these different kind of analyzers 
have their unique advantages in analysis of fluid 
samples. The flow cell analyzer provides simplified 
fluid handling and minimizing reagent consumption. The present invention is particularly 
concerned with flow cell analyzer systems and means for  
 
improving the operation and movement of the various 
components. One of the difficulties in flow cell 
analyzers is the problem in monitoring the flow stream 
through the flow cell. Moreover, the flow cell is 
often located in a manner that is not easily physically 
accessable or visible which causes difficulty in 
increased costs and operation. Moreover, another 
difficulty associated with the flow cell is the 
difficulty of injecting sample from the reaction cup 
into an injection cell and draining fluid from the flow 
cell
