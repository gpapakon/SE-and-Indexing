<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to improvements in 
platform lifts which can be used to raise a load, 

such as a handicapped person, to a higher level to 
enable them to enter a vehicle or for raising goods 

for loading light-van lifts and the like. The 
invention therefore provides a platform lift (10) 

comprising platform support means (11,14,15,17,18), 
first actuation means for raising and lowering said 

platform support means, a platform (19) pivotally 
attached to said platform support means, and second 

actuation means for opening and closing said 
platform, said second actuation means (26,27) 

comprising a cam (27) mounted on said platform 
support means and a cam follower (26) mounted on an 

articulated connecting rod (22,24), said connecting 
rod being pivotally connected at opposite ends 

thereof to the platform support means and the 
platform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improvements in 
platform lifts which can be used to raise a load, 
such as a handicapped persons to a higher level to 
enable them to enter a vehicle or for raising goods 
for loading light-van lifts and the like. For handicapped persons with limited mobility or 
those confined to wheelchairs, it is particularly 
difficult to climb steps or enter and exit vehicles. 
A number of lifts particularly for vehicles, have 
therefore been devised which lift the passenger from 
ground level to the level of the floor of the vehicle 
so that the wheelchair can be pushed into the vehicle 
or the passenger can walk therein. Similar lifts 
have been designed to facilitate the loading of vans. One such lift is described in EP-A1-0119914. 
This prior art device utilises a parallelogram which 
is deformable under the action of a hydraulic drive 
piston. As the parallelogram is deformed under action 
of the piston, the arms of the parallelogram 
supporting the platform are lowered. The platform 
itself is caused to pivot from a stowed vertical 
position to an open horizontal position under the 
action of a connecting rod of variable length. As the connecting rod of this device is a lost 
motion type of device, it relies on gravity or spring 
means to open the platform. There is a significant 
danger with such a device in that if it is 
accidentally prevented from opening as it is lowered, 
say by a handbag strap or the edge of a door, once 
the obstruction is removed, the platform would fall 
open out of control. Obviously, if there are 
handicapped people or people in wheelchairs in the 
vicinity of the platform, this could be potentially 
dangerous.  Again, platform opening and closing motions with 
these prior art devices are characterised by very 
high accelerations and decelerations at either end of 
the travel. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a platform lift which overcomes 
these disadvantages and has improved safety features. According to the invention there is provided a 
platform lift comprising platform support means, 
first actuation means for raising and lowering said 
platform support means, a platform pivotally attached 
to said platform support means, and second actuation 
means for opening and closing said platform, said 
second actuation means comprising a cam mounted on 
said platform support means and a cam follower 
mounted on an articulated connecting rod, said 
connecting rod being pivotally connected at opposite 
ends thereof to the platform
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A platform lift (10) comprising platform support 
means (11,14,15,17,18), first actuation means for 

raising and lowering said platform support means, a 
platform (19) pivotally attached to said platform 

support means, and second actuation means for opening 
and closing said platform, characterised in that said 

second actuation means (26,27) comprise a cam (27) 
mounted on said platform support means and a cam 

follower (26) mounted on an articulated connecting 
rod (22,24), said connecting rod being pivotally 

connected at opposite ends thereof to the platform 
support means and the platform. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in claim 1 in 
which the cam (27) is a double acting cam. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2 in which the cam (27) has a cam profile (28) 

which accelarates the opening of the platform (19) as 
it leaves its closed position. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims in which the cam (27) has a cam 

profile (28) which decelarates the opening of the 
platform (19) as it nears its opened position. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims in which the cam follower (26) 

always remains in engagement with the cam (27). 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims in which the first actuation 

means comprise a hydraulic piston and cylinder 
 

arrangement. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims in which the platform support 

means (11,14,15,17,18) comprise a pair of side arms 
(14,15) pivotally connected at first ends thereof to 

a base (14), and at opposite ends thereof to an upper 
arm (17). 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in claim 7 in 
which the said upper arm (17) is extended beyond the 

pivotal connection (16b) with one of said side arms 
(15) to form an extended arm (18), said platform (19) 

being pivotally attached to said extended arm. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in claim 7 or 
claim 8 in which the cam (27) is attached to, or 

forms an extension of, one of the side arms (15). 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in claim 8 or 
claim 9 in which a s
top (21) is mounted on said 
extended arm (18) to prevent the platform (19) from 

pivoting more than substantially 90Â° to the 
extended arm. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims in which articulated members of 

said connecting rod (22,24) remain in a substantially 
fixed position relative to each other as the open 

platform (9) is raised or lowered between ground 
level and floor height. 
A platform lift (10) as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims in which articulated members of 

said connecting rod (22,24) pivot relative to each 
other as the platform (19) is opened or closed, the 

 
distance between the end pivot points of the 

actuation means decreasing to cause the platform to 
pivot closed.
