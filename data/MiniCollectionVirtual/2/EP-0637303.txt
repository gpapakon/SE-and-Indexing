<DESCRIPTION>
N-ARYLOXY(THIO)ALKYL-AZACYCLOALKANES USEFUL AS CALCIUM CHANNEL ANTAGONISTSThe present invention relates to aiyloxyalkylamino and arylthioal ylamino derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy, in particular in the treatment of ischaemic stroke.Stroke is reportedly the third most common cause of death in the developed world. Current therapies for ischaemic stroke are limited and have a number of disadvantages, such as the risk of exacerbating haemorrhage. There is therefore a need for new and improved treatments for ischaemic stroke. EP-A-103252 discloses a broad class of aryloxyalkylamino derivatives. These compounds are said to have utility as herbicides.French Patent Application No. 1601591 describes a class of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds derived from phenoxyalkyl alcohols, which are said to be cholesterol-lowering agents. We have now found that certain aryloxyalkylamino and aryltWoalkylamino derivatives exhibit activity as calcium channel antagonists.The present invention therefore provides, in a first aspect, use of a compound of formula (I):(CH2)n N-(CH2)q-X-ArFormula (I)in which n is 3 to 8; q is 5 to 11;R1 represents Cι_6alkyl or Ci.galkoxy; s is zero, 1 or 2; X represents oxygen or sulphur, andAr represents phenyl optionally substituted by 1-3 substituents selected from halo, Ci.galkyl, Ci.galkoxy, Cι_2--lkylenedioxy e.g. methylenedioxy, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethyloxy, or a group Ph-(CH2)m"Y"(CH2 p" where Ph is optionally substituted 

phenyl, m and p are independently 0 to 4 and Y is a bond, O, S, or CH=CH, provided that m + p is not greater than 4, or Ar is an optionally substituted tricyclic heteroaryl group:in which Y* is Y(CΗ )X where x is 0 or 1 and Y is O, S or NR where R is hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl, Z is (CH^ or -CH=CH-, r is 0, 1 or 2 or Ar is the corresponding tricyclic dehydro ring system, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions related to the accumulation of calcium in the brain cells of mammals.Preferably n is 4, 5 or 6, most preferably 5.Preferably q is 6 to 9, most preferably 7.When s is other than zero R* preferably represents Cj_6alkyl, such as methyl.X preferably represents oxygen.When Ar is substituted by a group Ph(-CH2)mY(CH2)p-, Y is preferably oxygen or a bond. WhenY is oxygen p is preferably zero and mis preferably zero or 1. WhenY is a bond the sum of m+p is preferably 1 or 2. When Y represents CH=CH, m and p are
