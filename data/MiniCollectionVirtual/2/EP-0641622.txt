<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of electric arc 
welding with filler wire and more particularly to a method and 
system for measuring or determining the operating characteristics 
of an arc welding wire of the type sold on a spool, reel, coil or 
drum. The invention is particularly applicable for use with filler 
wire for arc welding of the type provided on spools or reels and 
used for automatic or semi-automatic arc welding processes. 
Indeed, the invention is most applicable for use with filler wire 
sold in large spools or reels and used for robotic, automatic 
welding and it will be described with particular reference to this 
specific type of filler wire used for mass production; however, it 
should be appreciated that the invention has broader applications 
and can be used to predict and/or determine the quality of the 
filler wire and to future operating characteristics of a filler 
wire. The invention uses predictive or indirect testing procedure 
for filler wire. When employing robotic welding equipment for mass producing 
repetitive welds, the manufacturing facility obtains filler wire 
normally having a low carbon content and supplied to the 
manufacturing facility in large coils or reels. The reels are 
loaded onto the welding machine, which welding machine has been set 
to a preselected wire feed speed, applied voltage levels and other 
process parameters. At the end of a reel, a replacement reel of 
filler wire is loaded onto the machine. In some instances, the end 
of the wire on the first reel is spliced to the beginning of the 
wire on the second reel. In this manner, the mass produced 
repetitive welding operations are performed continuously and 
economically to reduce the cost of the product being manufactured. 
This high production arc welding procedure requires a consistent 
filler wire and, more for cosmetic purposes, the filler wire should 
create a low amount of spatter, or no spatter, during the welding 
process. The requirements of consistency and low spatter are 
universal requirements for mass producing welds of the type 
employing filler wire in an arc welding process. If the filler 
wire is not consistent, the subsequent reels of wire require 
readjustment of the speed and electrical characteristics of the 
welding machine. Consequently, if the filler wire is not  
 
consistent from reel-to-reel for day-after-day, the filler wire is 
generally considered unacceptable and does not command commercial 
allegiance. Not only must the wire from reel-to-reel be 
consisten
