<ABSTRACT>
A travelling rail hanging device comprising a pair of longitudinal travelling 
rails (1) and a transverse travelling rail (2). The longitudinal travelling 

rails (1) are supported from, for example, a ceiling via connecting members 
(3) having eyenut at the opposed ends thereof. Free running trolleys (5) are 

arranged in the longitudinal travelling rails, and the transverse travelling 
rail (2) is swingingly supported by the longitudinal travelling rails (1). 

A free running trolley (7) for hanging a hoist is arranged on the transverse 
travelling rail (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
hanging travelling rails. In a known crane, the crane comprises a pair of 
stationary longitudinal travelling rails extending in 
parallel to each other, a movable transverse travelling 
rail supported at the opposed ends thereof by the 
longitudinal travelling rails, and a hoist movably hung 
on the transverse travelling rail. Each of the 
longitudinal travelling rails has a trolley which is 
moved along the longitudinal travelling rail by a motor, 
and the opposed ends of the transverse travelling rail 
are rotatably and slidably supported by the corresponding 
trolleys (Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
No. 50-33291). As mentioned above, in this crane, the trolleys 
are driven by motors. However, there is a requirement 
for a crane in which a hoist can be manually moved to a 
target position. In this required crane, the motor 
driven trolleys cannot be used, and free running trolleys 
are used. In a crane such that a hoist can be manually 
moved to a target position, the most important point 
resides in how smoothly and easily a hoist can be 
manually moved to a target position. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
travelling rail hanging device capable of smoothly and 
easily moving a load such as a hoist, by a manual 
operation, to a target position. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a device for hanging travelling rails  
 
comprising: a pair of longitudinal travelling rails 
substantially horizontally extending in parallel to each 
other; a pair of at least two connecting members normally 
vertically extending above the corresponding longitudinal 
travelling rails for hanging the corresponding 
longitudinal travelling rails, each connecting member 
having an upper end which is loosely coupled to a fixed 
member via a first flexible joint and having a lower end 
which is loosely coupled to the corresponding 
longitudinal travelling rails via a second flexible 
joint; a pair of first free running trolleys each 
supported by the corresponding longitudinal travelling 
rail to travel in a longitudinal direction of the 
corresponding longitudinal travelling rail; a transverse 
travelling rail substantially horizontally extending in a 
transverse direction with respect to the longitudinal 
travelling rails below the longitudinal travelling rails 
and pivotally connected to the first free running 
trolleys; and a second free running trolley for hanging a 
load, the second free running trolley being supported by 
the
