<ABSTRACT>
An optical communication system for compensating 
dispersion of an optical fiber serving as a transmission 

path is provided. In its simplest form of configuration, 

a dispersion compensating fiber having a sufficient 
length to compensate the chromatic dispersion of the optical 

fiber (100a) is divided into portions (200a, 200b) each having a 
length to maintain a linear characteristic of a relative 

intensity noise of the dispersion compensating fiber, and 
the divided portions (200a, 200b) of the dispersion compensating fiber 

are inserted in the path of the optical fiber while they 
are optically separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
communication system according to the preamble of claim 1. A
system of this kind is known from EP 0 464 812 A1.In the optical communication system, an optical
fiber is used as a transmission path and a signal light
outputted from an optical transmitter is propagated in
the optical fiber to conduct the optical communication.
In the past, a laser diode which emits a laser beam having
a center wavelength of 1.3 µm was used as the optical
transmitter and an optical fiber for a 1.3 µm band was
installed as the transmission path to conduct the digital
transmission (optical communication). Thereafter, it has
been found that the wavelength existing a minimum
transmission loss of the glass used as the material of the
optical fiber is at 1.55 µm and it has been discussed to
propagate a laser beam having a center wavelength of 1.55
µm through the existing optical fiber in order to attain
the communication over a longer distance. However, the
laser diode has a specific spectrum width (Δω) in its
oscillation wavelength. The propagation speeds in the
optical fiber are different between a short wavelength 
component and a long wavelength component contained in
the signal light (dispersion characteristic of the
optical fiber). Thus, when the laser beam having the
center wavelength of 1.55 µm is propagated through the
optical fiber optimized for the 1.3 µm band, the optical
signal is distorted so that the transmission distance,
the transmission band and the bit rate are limited.In order to compensate the dispersion characteristic
of the optical fiber, dispersion compensation techniques
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 62-65529
and Conf. on Optical Fiber Comm. 1992. PD-14, PD-15
have been proposed. An optical fiber having an opposite
sign of dispersion characteristic to that of the optical
fiber used as the transmission path is inserted to
compensate the dispersion characteristic.On the other hand, the inventors of the present
invention have proved that the longer the optical fiber
is, the longer is the dispersion compensating fiber and a
carrier to noise ratio (CNR) is deteriorated, which
impedes good optical communication. From US 4,261,639 an optical pulse equalization
technique for minimizing pulse dispersion in a single mode
fiber transmission system is known which uses the positive
and negative dispersion characteristics of single mode fibers
on both sides of the zero total dispersion wave length. The
transmission fiber and the equalizer fiber known from
