<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine for grinding the rails of a railway track, advantageously a self-propelled machine. The machine is of the type comprising a chassis (4) supported by flanged wheels (2) bearing on the rails (3) of the railway track, at least one grinding unit (6) provided with a grinder (7) and with a device for driving the grinder in rotation, means for lowering and raising the grinding unit relative to the rail, means for pivoting the unit around the rail (3) to be ground, in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the latter, and means for displacing the unit laterally, forming a means for avoiding obstacles, as well as a device for supporting the grinding unit on the chassis. The machine is characterised in that the means for lowering and raising, the means for pivoting and the means for laterally displacing the grinding unit (6) are incorporated with the said support, so as to form a compact subunit (22) with relatively small dimensions. The invention can be used for treating the rails of a railway track.
