<DESCRIPTION>
 URACIL DERIVATIVES AS ENZYME INHIBITORSThe present invention relates to certain enzyme inhibitors which are especially useful for co-administration with other therapeutic compounds such as antiviral compounds in order to provide an improved therapeutic effect including reduction in toxic side-effects.A therapeutic nucleoside that has been found to have a particularly beneficial clinical effect against a spectrum of conditions associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), ATDS-related complex (ARC) and asymptomatic infections, is the compound 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine(AZT) having the approved name zidovudine. This compound at low doses is generally very well tolerated by patients and is now widely used in the treatment of HIV infections. However, in certain patients treated with zidovudine, some haematological suppression including anaemia and neutropenia may be observed, presumably arising from a certain limited level of toxicity of zidovudine observed towards stem cells. Other less commonly observed side-effects have been described such as myopathy which may be related to intracellular activity of zidovudine.Recently, it has been found that uridine and cytidine could reverse the toxic effect of zidovudine in yitro(Sommadosi, et al., Antimicrobial Agents Chemo., 1987, 31 :453- 454). However, uridine is toxic to humans when given via continuous infusion in vivo. When uridine is administered to a patient in an intermittent schedule, it is rapidly eliminated from the plasma(van Groeniger, et al., 1986, Cancer Treatment Rept. 70:745-750).US patent 4,874,602 describes the use of 5-benzylacyclouridine(BAU) for the reduction of the severity of anemia induced by the administration of zidovudine. This compound has been described as an inhibitor of the enzyme uridine phosphorylase which is responsible for the cleavage of uridine to uracil(Niedzwicki, et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1982, 31:1857-1861). Several derivatives of BAU have been shown to be superior to BAU in their ability to inhibit uridine phosphorylase(Naguib, et. al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987, 36:2195-2201). Certain 5-benzyl barbituate compounds have been described as uridine phosphorylase inhibitors which are useful for reducing 

the toxicity and anemia induced by antiviral drugs, such as AZT, as well as for potentiating anticancer drugs and combatting their host-toxicity(PCT Publication No. WO 91/16315). Furthermore, benzyloxy derivatives of BAU have been reported to decrease the
