 COFOLYMERS OF OLEFINS AND AROMATIC OLEFINS AND OF OLEFINS AND POLYMERIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to selectively fh 5 halogenated copolymers containing at least one polymerized α-olefin and an monomeric or polymeric alkylbenzene containing comonomer and to the preparation of crosslinked compositions therefrom. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION10 Amorphous copolymers containing ethylene and at least one other C2-C8 α-olefin comonomer are well known materials which exhibit elastomeric properties and exceptional resistance to oxidative degradation. Crosslinked ethylene/α-olefin copolymers are15 particularly useful in applications such as moldings, coatings, tires, and other shaped articles where good ozone resistance and weatherability are particularly desirable.Crosslinking of such copolymers containing no20 ethylenic unsaturation can be carried out through radical formation induced by peroxides or other free radical generators used alone or in conjunction with crosslinking agents such as sulfur or polyfunctional electrophilic reagents. Terpolymers containing25 minor amounts of a diene monomer such as alkylidene norbornene, 1,4-hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene and the like are sulfur curable as a consequence of the availability of a double bond not incorporated into the polymer chain which acts as a cure site in30 sulfur curing.For example, sulfur curable elastomeric terpolymers comprising ethylene, propylene and a substituted norbornene such as 5-phenyl-2-norbornene are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,478,002. 

 U.S. Patent No. 3,506,627 discloses the preparation of copolymers of ethylene, propylene and allyl benzene (optionally with some incorporated diene) which may be cross linked using a free radical system if the polymers are saturated, or with conventional sulfur where the polymer is unsaturated in the polymer backbone.In addition, Holmquist et al., J. Appl. Poly . Sci., 1971, p. 2103-2114, teach the curing of terpolymers containing ethylene, propylene and 4- alkyl-1-butenes, e.g., 4-phenyl-l-butene, using a polyfunctional electrophilic crosslinking agent such as a bis benzylic halide. Crosslinking is said to occur by reaction at aromatic ring sites present along the polymer chain.Organolithium initiators containing vinyl unsaturation have been used to initiate polymerization of anionically polymerizable monomers to produce vinyl terminated macromolecules which may be then used as a macromeric component in the preparation of copolymers by ionic or free radical
