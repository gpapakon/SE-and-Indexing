<ABSTRACT>
The present invention aims, in a large sized wood made building or 
other wood made member using field, to provide an adhereing and joining 

technique of the wood member which is excellent in strenght, beautiful 
outlook and workability. 
In joining one side wood (1) and another side wood (2), a plurality 
of slits (S₁,S₂) are respectively formed to the end portions 

of the wood desired to be joined such that each corresponding slits of 
both sides make same surface upon abutting said both end portions, and 

each other of the wood end portions formed with said slits are fixed by 
the temporary fixing means to a desired joining state and then an 

adhesive agent is applied into the interior surfaces of the slits, and 
the connecting plate (CP) made of reinforced plastic material applied 

with the adhesive agent on the surfaces thereof is inserted into a gap 
formed to same flat surfaces by slits of one side wood end portion and 

slites of another side wood end portion corresponding to this so as to 
cover over said both slits end then the adhesive agent is hardened 

whereby each other of the wood end portions are joined and fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a joining technique by
adhering of wood, and more particularly to a joining
technique by adhering method especially exerting an effect
in joining toward lengthwise direction or multiple
directions of long size material or else in joining toward
perpendicular direction.The wood has been widely used from old days as an
optimum material for a building material and furniture from
many advantages such as beauty of quality sense, easiness of
working, or easiness of obtaining, and capableness of
recycling as resources.And, in case of intending to utilize the wood as
described above, a matter which has been always a problem
from old days to nowadays is a problem of handling how to
handle a joining portion between members, in other word, a
handling capable of bearing against a stress operating to
the joining portions.For instance of building material, nails or metal 
fittings have been used for the joining of column or girder
in a small size house, and bolts, lug screws, drift pins
have been used for the joining of trass of a large size
building.GB-A-2 245 676 describes also a method for joining a pair of mitred members
by forcing a metal connector into preformed slots adjacent the mitred ends.However, in order to join the members without
decreasing of strength by these methods, a number of joining
materials or large sized metal fittings are required. As
a result, problems are occurred that its cost is increased
and beautiful appearance is decreased.On the other hand, in accordance with an adhering
method, the joining portion can be processed in small and
beautiful, but this method is limited to a material that the
member size is small as a furniture and a stress for
transferring is not so big.In a utilization of an adhering joining in a large
wooden building, a great expectation has been had until now,
but for a realization of this, an inducement of higher and
newer adhesive agent in an adhering strength and a fireproof
characteristic and a development of simple and reliable
processing technique are indispensable.The present invention aims to solve above-described
conventional problems and to this end it is proposed a joining method
according to appending claims 1 and 11. FIG.1 is a perspective view showing a slit formation in
a first preferred embodiment of the present invention,FIG.2 is a perspective view showing a state that two
members are temporarily fixed by facing the slit portions
each other,FIG.3 is a perspective view showing a process for
inserting the connecting plate
