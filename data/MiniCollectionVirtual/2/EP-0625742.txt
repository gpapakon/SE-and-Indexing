<ABSTRACT>
A constituent unit for an optical information 
processing system comprises an input information 

displaying device (2), which one-dimensionally, two-dimensionally, 
or three-dimensionally displays presented 

information as an optical pattern. Each of optical 
correlation operation devices (1,3) located close to the input 

information displaying device detects only an optical 
pattern falling within a predetermined range among the 

optical pattern displayed on the input information 
displaying device, and carries out an optical correlation 

operation in order to calculate correlation between 
information representing the detected optical pattern and 

predetermined information having been stored in each 
optical correlation operation device. Each optical 

correlation operation device thereafter feeds out the 
results of the correlation operation. Each of electric 

operation devices (4) receives the results of the correlation 
operation from a predetermined number of the optical 

correlation operation devices, carries out a 
predetermined operation on the results of the correlation 

operation, and feeds out the results of the predetermined 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a constituent unit
for an optical information processing system,
particularly for an optical information processing system
wherein light is utilized as a medium carrying
information, and a constituent unit group for such an
optical information processing system. This invention
also relates to an optical information processing system
which utilizes the constituent unit or the constituent
unit group.A typical approach in the fields of optical
computing and optical information processing is to carry
out large-scaled parallel processing on two-dimensional
patterns by utilizing the characteristics that the light
can travel quickly and can be processed in parallel. In
such cases, predetermined optical parallel processing is
often carried out by simultaneously forming multiple
images from an input pattern and carrying out a different
image operation on each of the multiple images. Examples
of such processing include parallel operations for
calculating the sum of products of a matrix and a vector,
which operations form the foundation of a neural network,
and parallel operations for calculating the levels of
correlation between an input image and comparative images 
in pattern recognition. By way of example, a multiple
imaging optical system shown in Figure 18 is one of basic
components in optical parallel processing.Various multiple imaging optical systems have
heretofore been proposed with respect to each of
incoherent illumination and coherent illumination. For
the processing under incoherent illumination, the image
forming performance is rated with respect to a multiple
imaging optical system which utilizes a lens array. For
the processing under coherent illumination, various
devices, such as a Dammann grating, a two-dimensional
phase grating, a hologram device, and a pinhole array
self-imaging device, have heretofore been proposed. The
multiple imaging optical systems are applied to parallel
operations for calculating the sum of products of a
matrix and a vector, parallel optical connection
utilizing the operations for calculating the sum of
products of a matrix and a vector, parallel matched
filtering, and the like.Also, application of a multiple imaging optical
system, which utilizes a microlens array, to optical
parallel processing has been proposed by Hamanaka, et al.
