<ABSTRACT>
The process serves for making twin plain tiles after basic moulding and before firing, the two plain tiles being connected to each other by two end connecting webs and at least one intermediate web. For this purpose, the strand or the blank cut off to tile length is directed into a separating device. At a virtually constant feed rate, the lugs (49, 50) are separated from the two end connecting webs (51, 52) of the blank. Furthermore, for a reliable separating of the two plain tiles in the longitudinal direction, a predetermined breaking notch (53) is formed in each. The separating operations are performed by cutting and/or punching, the punching operations being executed in a single working step. This process is not only very inexpensive, but also extremely reliable and easily adjustable, catering for the requirements of the operator.

A process for manufacturing twin raw plain tiles
after base shaping and before burning, whereby both plain

tiles are connected to each other by means of two end
connecting ribs and at least one intermediate rib,

characterized in that the string or the raw tile cut off to
a tile length is fed into a separating device, studs (49, 50)

are separated from both end connecting ribs (51, 52) with the
twin raw tile being fed at a substantially constant speed,

and at least one breaking notch (53) is formed in a
longitudinal direction for said ribs, whereby the separating

operations and the forming of said breaking notches are
performed by cutting with separating pins (10, 17).
The process according to claim 1, characterized
in that the separating of said studs from both end connecting

ribs as well as the forming of said breaking notches are
performed by setting said cutting pins in two working

positions in said end connecting ribs, whereby in the one
working position a continuous separating line is produced in

said connecting rib while in the other working position said
connecting ribs are separated on a large portion of their

thickness to form said breaking notches.
A device for manufacturing twin raw plain tiles
after base shaping and before burning, characterized in that

at least one pair of separating pins (10, 17) facing each
other is provided as cutting members, whereby said pins

execute substantially a synchronized movement in the feeding
direction of said string of twin raw tiles during

manufacturing, thereby cutting the raw tile, and then go back
to the starting working position with a backward movement

without working.
The device according to claim 3, characterized
in that said separating pins have a shank (67) and a head

(66).
The device according to claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that said separating pins are clamped with

a lengthwise adjustability in clamping members (68). 
The device according to any one of claims 3 to
5, characterized in that control means are provided to

control separating members (10, 17) individually.
The device according to any one of claims 3 to
6, characterized by a circular cutting element with no

template.
