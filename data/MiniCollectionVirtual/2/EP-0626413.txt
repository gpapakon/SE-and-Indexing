<ABSTRACT>
A method for the high-purity synthesis of a 
diorganopolysiloxane having a functional group at only one 

molecular chain terminal, that is characterized by the preliminary 
silylation with a silylating agent of the silanol group-containing 

impurity present in the cyclic trisiloxane, and that is 
characterized by preliminarily converting the silanol group-containing 

impurity in the cyclic trisiloxane into a lithiated 
material by lithiation with an organolithium compound and then 

silylating this lithiated material using a silylating agent that 
contains silicon-bonded halogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
the preparation of diorganopolysiloxane that yields a 
very pure diorganopolysiloxane which bears a functional 
group at only one end of the molecular chain. 
Hereinafter this diorganopolysiloxane is identified as 
monoterminal-functional diorganopolysiloxane. The functional group reactivity of 
monoterminal-functional diorganopolysiloxane can be 
used as a starting material for graft organic polymers 
having diorganopolysiloxane chain branches. 
Diorganopolysiloxane of this type has the general 
formula 
R(R2SiO)pB 
in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, p is an 
integer with a value of at least 1, and B is hydrogen 
atom or a group with the general formula 
-SiR2R1 
in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group and R1 is 
the hydrogen atom or an organofunctional group. JP-A 
59-78236 [78,236/1984], 1-131247 [131,247/1989], and 2-92933 
[92,933/1990] teach the preparation of this type 
of diorganopolysiloxane by first subjecting cyclic 
trisiloxane with the general formula 
(R2SiO)3 
in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group to 
nonequilibration polymerization, optionally in the 
presence of silane or siloxane with the general formula 
R(R2SiO)mH 
in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group and m is 
an integer with a value of at least 1, under the effect 
of a lithium polymerization catalyst with the general 
formula 
R(R2SiO)nLi  
 
in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group and n is 
an integer with a value of at least zero, and by 
subsequently terminating this nonequilibration 
polymerization with acid or halosilane with the general 
formula 
R1R2SiX 
in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, R1 is 
hydrogen atom or an organofunctional group, and X is a 
halogen atom. However, several drawbacks are associated with the 
preparation of graft organic polymer using diorganopolysiloxane 
synthesized by the method described above. Thus, the viscosity of 
the graft organic polymer product undergoes a sharp increase as 
the molecular weight of the diorganopolysiloxane increases. 
Moreover, the graft organic polymer product gels when 
diorganopolysiloxane is used that has a number-average molecular 
weight above 10,000. The present inventor undertook various analyses of 
monoterminal-functional diorganopolysiloxane and its cyclic 
trisiloxane precursor. Using a Fourier-transform infrared 
spectrophotometer, the inventor confirmed that a silanol-containing 
impurity was present in the starting cyclic 
trisiloxane. Gel permeation chromatographic
