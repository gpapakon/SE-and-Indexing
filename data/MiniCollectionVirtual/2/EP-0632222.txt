<CLAIMS>
Holding device (1) made of plastic for fastening 
at least one tubular object (2) on a support (3), having 

a holding region (5) and a fastening region (6) which is 
of strip-like design, has a plurality of catches and, 

after being bent round the tubular object (2), can be 
connected to a mating latch (7) arranged on the holding 

region (5), the mating latch (7) consisting of a 
thickened element (9) and the respective catch of the 

fastening region (6) having at least two resilient webs 
(10; 12; 13) which engage behind the thickened element 

(9), characterized in that the webs (12) are of tongue-like 
design and are directed radially to the centre point 

of the mating latch (7).
