<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to: a chip package,
a chip carrier, and a method for producing the same; a
terminal electrode for a circuit substrate and a method
for producing the same; and a complex including the
above-mentioned chip package mounted on a circuit substrate
(hereinafter, such a complex will be referred to
as a "chip package-mounted complex").In recent years, the integration degrees of LSIs
(Large Scale Integrated Circuits) have remarkably imprcved,
and, accordingly, the number of pins included in
one LSI chip has been increasing. As for electronic
equipment incorporating LSI chip packages, the size and
the thickness thereof have been desired to be reduced.
Accordingly, a number of high-density mounting techniques
for mounting LSI chips on a circuit substrate at a high
density have been developed. A variety of shapes and
structures have been proposed for such LSI chip packages
(NIKKEI ELECTRONICS 1993. 8.2, No. 587, "LSI package
frontier, prompting high-density mounting", pp 93 to 99).In the present specification, the term "chip
carrier" refers to a substrate including terminal electrodes
(which are to be connected to electrodes of an LSI
chip) and contact electrodes (which are to be connected
to a circuit substrate). The term "chip package" refers
to a chip carrier with an LSI chip mounted thereon. The
chip package, as a whole, is to be mounted on a circuit
substrate so as to form a "chip package-mounted complex". Hereinafter, a method for mounting a conventional
chip package onto a circuit substrate will be briefly described.First, a chip carrier is formed in the following
manner. Via holes are formed in a printed circuit board
by using a laser beam or by a mold punching technique.
A ceramic board may be used instead of a printed circuit
board. Terminal electrodes are previously formed on both
faces of the printed circuit board. Thereafter, an
internal conductor in the printed circuit board is electrically
connected to the terminal electrodes by a
plating technique or the like. Next, an LSI chip is
adhered to an upper face of the above-mentioned chip
carrier in a face-up state by using a die bond. Thereafter,
electrode pads of the LSI chip are connected to the
terminal electrodes present on the upper face of the chip
carrier by a wire bonding technique. On the resultant
composite, a mold resin is applied so as to cover the LSI
chip and the wire bonding, thereby sealing the composite.Next, a solder layer is formed on the terminal
electrodes provided on a lower face (i.e., the face which
