<ABSTRACT>
A charging device for firing furnaces is described, having firing aids which receive the articles to be fired in at least two planes above one another on supporting surfaces and which can be set together with the articles to be fired onto a transporting unit which conveys at least one firing aid together with the articles to be fired into the firing furnace. The invention is distinguished in that, for charging and/or discharging the firing aids (14, 16), provision is made for a rotating unit (26) which receives at least two firing aids and moves the latter at least between a charging station (34) and/or a discharging station (30),   in that there is provided at least one pusher (60) which, in the charging station, pushes the articles (18) to be fired from a supply unit (44) onto a supporting surface of the firing aid located in the charging station and/or, in the discharging station, pushes the fired articles from the supporting surface of the firing aid onto a take-over unit (42 or 62), and in that a transfer unit (8) transfers the firing aids between the transporting unit and the rotating unit.
