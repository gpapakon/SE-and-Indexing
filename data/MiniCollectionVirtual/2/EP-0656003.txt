<DESCRIPTION>
 Condensed I ndol e derivatives as 5HT2o and 5HT2β antagoni stsThis invention relates to compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in the treatment of mammals.P. Fludzinski et. al., J. Med. Chem. 1986 292415-2418 describes N-(l,2-dimethyl-3-ethyl-lH-indol-5-yl)-N - (3-trifluoromethylphenyl)urea which shows selectivity for the rat stomach fundus serotonin receptor. WO 92/05170 describes certain urea derivatives which are described as possessing 5HTιc receptor antagonist activity. The 5HTi£ receptor has recently been reclassified as the 5HT2C receptor [P. Hartig et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences (TIPS) 1993].A structurally distinct class of compounds has now been discovered, which compounds have been found to have 5HT2 receptor antagonist activity. Certain compounds of the invention also show 5HT2B receptor antagonist activity, the 5HT2B receptor being previously known as the fundus receptor [P.Hartig et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences (TIPS) 1993]. 5HT2C 5HT2B receptor antagonists are believed to be of potential use in the treatment of CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, anorexia, Alzheimers disease, sleep disorders, bulimia, panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol. nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus.Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:
 wherein:P represents a quinoline or isoquinoline residue, or a 5- or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring containing up to three heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur; R1 is hydrogen or C\. alkyl; 

R2, R3, R!0 and R11 are independently hydrogen or C g alkyl, or R ~ and R11 together form a bond, or R2 and RlO or R3 and R^ together form a C2-6 alkylene chain; R4 is hydrogen, C g alkyl, halogen, NR8R9 or OR12) where R8, R9 and R12 are independently hydrogen or C g alkyl; R-5 is hydrogen or C 1. alkyl;R7 is hydrogen, C\. alkyl, OR12 or halogen, where R12 is hydrogen or C g alkyl; and n is 2 or 3; and the groups R-~ and R14 are independently hydrogen or Cj.g alkyl.Cι_6 alkyl moieties can be straight chain or branched and are preferably Cμ3 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n- and iso- propyl.Suitable R4 and R7 halogens include chloro and bromo.Suitably R is hydrogen or C 1.5 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl or propyl.
