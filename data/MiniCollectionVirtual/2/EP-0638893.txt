<ABSTRACT>
A thin film read-write magnetic head useful in a tape 
apparatus includes a magnetic circuit consisting of two thin 

film magnetic layers (P1, P2) which form a magnetic yoke 
that is divided into three closely spaced sections (22, 24, 

26), the central section (24) of at least one of the 
magnetic layers (P1, P2) containing an interspace in which a 

flux sensing element (199), such as a magnetoresistive 
device or Hall effect device, is located. The three section 

yoke forms a continuous magnetic circuit, except for the 
transducing gap (G), which circuit consists of three 

sections corresponding to the three sections (22, 24, 26) of 
the yoke. The total gap width determines the width (Ww) of 

the data track (30) being recorded. During the write mode, a 
magnetic valve (18) including an electronical conductor 

provides a shunt path to bypass the flux sensing means (19) 
so that all three sections (22, 24, 26) of the head operate 

for recording. During the read mode, only the central yoke 
section (24) and its transducing gap (G) portion sense the 

data signal recorded on the magnetic tape, and the read 
element detects the sensed signal. A saturation current is 

directed to the valve conductor (18) during the read mode so 
that the shunt path is open, thereby allowing the flux 

sensing means (19) to operate and sense the readout signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
U.S. patent application Serial Number 07/807,194 filed December 
16, 1991 on behalf of E. Valstyn et al., and assigned to the same 
assignee, discloses a read-write magnetic head which incorporates 
a thin film inductive write head and a flux sensing read element. 
The subject matter of this copending patent application is 
incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to a thin film magnetic head useful in 
tape storage apparatus and in particular to a magnetic head 
assembly incorporating an inductive write head and a flux sensing 
read element. Thin film magnetic heads or transducers typically employ 
inductive elements for recording and reading data. As is well 
known, thin film magnetic heads comprise a first magnetic layer, 
designated as P1, and a second magnetic layer, designated as P2, 
both preferably made of Permalloy. The P1 and P2 layers make 
contact at a back closure to form a magnetic yoke having a 
continuous magnetic path with a transducing gap between the P1 
and P2 layers. During the recording or write mode, electrical 
signals representative of data are directed to the transducer and 
are recorded as magnetic flux signals on an associated surface of 
a magnetic disk or tape. During the read mode, the recorded 
magnetic flux signals are sensed and transduced by the transducer 
to produce electrical signals which are read out as data for 
further utilization. It is known that magnetoresistive (MR) and Hall effect devices 
may be used as flux sensing elements to implement the readout 
function. Flux sensing elements can be used in disk drives or  
 
with tape storage apparatus. In a conventional recording head 
having an MR read transducer, the write and read sections of the 
head must be carefully aligned with each other to effectuate 
proper track following for writing and reading data. The lateral 
region of sensitivity (which is the read width) is determined by 
the length of the MR transducer. This transducer length must be 
approximately equal to the width of the data track to be read. 
In contrast, in the MR head disclosed in the aforementioned 
copending patent application, the MR element is positioned in a 
space between portions of the P2 layer. Magnetic heads are used extensively in disk drives with rigid or 
flexible disks and in tape storage apparatus having flexible 
tape. Flexible tape tends to wobble or deviate from a precise 
straight linear motion as the tape is transported from the supply 
reel to the takeup reel in a tape apparatus. Magnetic tape also 
is
