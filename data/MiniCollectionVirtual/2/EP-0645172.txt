<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a catalyst comprising a first 
catalyst ingredient comprising at least one component 

selected from the group consisting of Pt, Pd and Ir and 
oxides thereof. It may further comprise at least one 

component selected from the group consisting of Au, Ag, Cu, 
Fe, Sb, Se, Te and Ta and oxides thereof as a second 

catalyst ingredient. These are supported on at least one 
component selected from silica-boria-alumina composite 

oxides or zeolites with a silica-to-alumina molar ratio of 
more than 30, in an amount from 0.1 to 10 g of the first 

catalyst ingredient and from 0.01 to 5 g of the second 
catalyst ingredient, each per one litre of the catalyst, 

with the second to first ingredient weight ratio being less 
than 1. 
The catalyst is used for treating exhaust gases by 
bringing the exhaust gases containing HCl and dioxines into 

contact with the catalyst thereby eliminating dioxines 
contained in the exhaust gases by oxidative decomposition 

while suppressing additional formation of dioxines from 
precursors for dioxines present in the exhaust gases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for the
elimination of dioxines in exhaust gases, a production
process for this novel catalyst and a method of treating
exhaust gases to eliminate dioxines using the catalyst.
The catalyst acts by oxidatively decomposing to reduce
polychlorobenzo-para-dioxines and polychlorobenzo-furans.Exhaust gases generated, for example, from incineration
facilities for disposing of industrial wastes and
municipal wastes, steel making plants and metal refining
industries contain a slight amount of toxic organic chloro
compounds such as dioxines, PCB and chlorophenol in
addition to toxic substances such as SOx NOx, HCl and cyan,
and a technique for removing them has now been under
development with view points of human health and
environmental protection.The substances referred to as dioxines are compounds
of polychlorodibenzo-para-dioxines (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans
(PCDFs) and include from dichlorides to
octachlorides depending on the number of chlorine atoms and
their isomers include as many as 75 kinds for PCDDs and 135
kinds for PCDFs. Among them, tetrachlorodibenzo dioxines
(T4CDDs) are known as the most toxic substance. Further,
since dioxines are highly stable water insoluble substances
and their toxicity is substantially permanent, they are
considered to be the most significant chemical substance
that causes environmental pollution, being coupled with
their strong toxicity.It is known that dioxines are formed by reaction of
unburnt residual carbon, oxygen and chlorides (such as
metal chlorides) in exhaust gases and that they are formed
in a certain temperature range from organic chlorine compounds
such as chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols. These are
present in exhaust gases discharged from incinerators as 
precursors and the dioxines are formed therefrom under the
catalytic effects of various elements in fly ashes in
incineration plants. However, all of discharged compounds
are effects of the fly ashes present together in the
exhaust gases and it has not yet been reported that the
dioxines are formed by the effect of catalysts disposed in
facilities for treating the exhaust gases.In the present specification, various substances
contained in the exhaust gases to be treated and having a
possibility of being converted into dioxines are
collectively referred to as precursors for the dioxines.A guideline regarding the operation of incineration
plants was issued from the Ministry of Health and Welfare
of Japan (referred to herein as "Ministry of Health and
Welfare")
