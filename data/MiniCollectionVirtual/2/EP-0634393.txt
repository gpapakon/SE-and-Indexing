<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel polymerizable compounds which, in addition to an enamine function, contain at least one polymerizable ethylenic group in the molecule and are distinguished by the fact that they result in a new class of monomers, prepolymers or polymers which can be functionalized or matched to the desired area of application with respect to their properties through slight variations in the production process according to the invention. Such enamines are suitable, inter alia, in composite materials for the production of materials having elastomeric properties, for example casting materials or filling materials in the dental sector. Furthermore, this new class of compounds is used for the preparation of solid plastic matrices and for the simple synthesis of homopolymers and copolymers for a wide variety of applications.
