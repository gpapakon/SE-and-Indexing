<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a beauty unit for 
applying an asbsorbing action and a pressing action to 

the skin. The beauty unit comprises an electromagnet 
excited by a commercial power supply, an air pump having 

an absorbing opening portion for guiding negative pressure 
air and a discharge opening portion for guiding a pressing 

opening portion, operating members associated with the 
exciting action of the electromagnet to apply amplitude 

motion to diaphragms of said air pump, a control circuit 
for controlling the exciting action of the electromagnet, 

a main body having an inserting opening portion connected 
to the absorbing opening portion and the discharge opening 

portion, respectively, and an manipulating member comprised 
of a flexible introducing tube provided at one end with 

a rear connector capable of being inserted into the inserting 
opening portion and at the other end with a skin contact 

appliance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a beauty unit for 
applying an absorbing action and a pressing action to the 
skin. There is known a conventional beauty unit in which 
an absorbing action and a pressing action are applied to 
the skin so as to rise stains, makeup dregs or the like 
adhered to a sweat gland and a sebaceous gland to the skin 
surface or a massage is given to the skin so as to facilitate 
the circulation of the blood. Such a beauty unit as described 
has a body capable of being carried by hand. The body 
is interiorly provided with a motor, a motion conversion 
mechanism for converting rotation of the motor into reciprocating 
motion, and an operating body in which a diaphragm 
is operated by the motion conversion mechanism to alternately 
form a negative pressure state and a pressing state. A 
skin contact portion is provided on the outside of the body. 
This skin contact portion is brought into pressure contact 
with the skin surface to thereby apply the absorbing action  
 
and the pressing action to the skin surface. In the conventional beauty unit as described above, 
its relatively heavy body which encases therein the motor 
and the motion conversion mechanism is carried by hand for 
use. Accordingly, not only there occurs an inconvenience 
of giving the hand fatigue but also the maniputability is 
poor since the body is large. There are another disadvantages 
that a motor having a large capacity cannot be used, and 
since the unit has a rotating part, the using life thereof 
is short. An object of the present invention is to improve the 
above-described disadvantages of the prior art and to provide 
a beauty unit whose portion carried by hand is light in 
weight and manipulatability is excellent. A beauty unit according to the present invention 
comprises an electromagnet excited by a commercial power 
supply, an air pump having an absorbing opening portion 
for guiding negative pressure air and a discharge opening 
portion for guiding a pressing opening portion wherein a 
negative pressure state and a pressing state are alternately 
formed in an internal chamber by amplitude motion of diaphragms, 
operating members associated with the exciting 
action of the electromagnet to apply the amplitude motion 
to the diaphragms of the air pump, a control circuit for  
 
controlling the exciting action of the electromagnet, a 
body having inserting opening portions connected to the 
absorbing opening portion and the discharge opening portion, 
respectively, and an manipulating member
