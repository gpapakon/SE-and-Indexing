<ABSTRACT>
The bridge has lugs forming hinge eyes on a horizontal spindle on the ramp, and a folding or telescoping extension at the free end, by which it rests on the lorry platform. A detachable stop (23,24) holds the lugs (14) in the horizontal position while the bridge plate (1) is being installed. There may be a recess in the plate at its ramp end and in which the lugs are accommodated, and they can fit between the top plate (2) and a cross-member (15) with no free movement. The member can be fixed at its ends to bottom flanges (3) on the plate. There can be bottom protrusions (23) on the lugs, bearing against a removable bar (24) on the ramp.

Transfer bridge for platforms (4), having a bridge 
plate (1) which is pivotable at the platform end about a 

horizontal axis, and an extension member (5) which is 
disposed so as to be retractable and extendable or 

respectively inwardly pivotable and outwardly pivotable on 

the free end of the bridge plate for support on the 
platform to be loaded or unloaded, the bridge plate (1) 

being provided with one or more lugs (14) on its end facing 
the platform to form a pivotal location, the eyelet (13) of 

said lugs surrounding a pin (6), which forms the horizontal 
axis and is mounted on the platform (4), characterised in 

that a detachable closure (23,24) is associated with the 
lugs (14), and the lugs (14) are lockable by said closure 

in an at least substantially horizontal position for the 
period of time during which the bridge plate (1) is 

mounted. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the bridge plate (1) is provided on its end facing the 

platform with a pocket-like receiving means for the lugs 
(14). 
Bridge according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the lugs (14) are disposed in a virtually clearance-free 

manner between a cover plate (2) of the bridge plate (1) 
and a cross-piece member (15) of the bridge plate (1). 
Bridge according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the ends of the cross-piece member (15) are securely 

connected to support members (3) of the bridge plate (1). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the lugs (14) are provided, on their underside, with a 

projection member (23) supported on a removable bar (24), 
which abuts against the platform (4).  

 
Bridge according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the projection member (23) has a hook-like configuration 

and grips the bar (24) when the lugs (14) are in their 
locked position. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a screw-connection (16,21) serves to secure the lugs (14) 

on the bridge plate (1), and said screw-connection is 
actuatable from the upper side of the bridge plate (1) 

through an opening (22) situated in the cover plate (2) of 
the bridge plate (1). 
Bridge according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that two lugs (14) are provided, 

which are distributed over the bridge width, a pin (6) 
being associated with each lug.
