<ABSTRACT>
A rotary compressor comprising two rotors 
(18a,18b) which have inter-engaging lobes and which 

rotate in a housing (10) having two laterally 
intersecting bores defining variable volume 

compression chambers (12a,12b) which merge cyclically 
into one as the rotors rotate, one chamber (12b) 

containing an inlet port (16) adapted to be coupled to 
a suction pipe and the other chamber containing an 

outlet port arrangement. The outlet port arrangement 
comprises at least one exit passage (20) controlled by 

a valve means (22) whose operation is responsive to 
the gas pressure across it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rotary 
compressors of the type comprising two rotors which 
have inter-engaging lobes and which rotate in a 
housing having two laterally intersecting bores 
defining variable volume compression chambers which 
merge cyclically into one as the rotors rotate. During the compression part of the cycle of known 
compressors of the latter type, one of the two rotors 
covers up an outlet port in one of the two bores until 
the pressure reaches approximately two-thirds of the 
design pressure. The outlet port is then 
progressively uncovered and the compressed gas 
contents of the chamber are discharged via the outlet 
port into a delivery pipe. A disadvantage of the known compressors of this 
type is that the built in compression is essentially 
fixed. When the pressure in the delivery pipe is 
high, the gas expands back into the compression 
chamber; When the pressure in the delivery pipe is 
low, the gas in the compression chamber expands into 
the delivery pipe. Both cases of over or under compression result in 
a substantial deviation from the desired polytropical 
compression cycle and thus in an increase in power 
consumption and an increase in gas outlet temperature. Furthermore, the delivery pipe is not 
hermetically sealed from the compression chamber when 
the rotor covers the outlet port because of necessary 
running clearance. This causes flow-back of gas from 
the delivery pipe to the suction (inlet) pipe.  It is an object of the present invention to 
achieve a true polytropical compression cycle and to 
keep the delivery (outlet) port hermetically sealed 
from the delivery pipe when covered by said one of the 
two rotors. In accordance with the present invention, there 
is provided a rotary compressor of the type comprising 
two rotors which have inter-engaging lobes and which 
rotate in a housing having two laterally intersecting 
bores defining variable volume compression chambers 
which merge cyclically into one as the rotors rotate, 
one chamber containing an inlet port adapted to be 
coupled to a suction pipe and the other chamber 
containing an outlet port arrangement comprising at 
least one exit passage controlled by a valve means 
whose operation is responsive to the gas pressure 
across it. In one embodiment, there is a plurality of such 
exit passages each of which has a respective valve 
means associated therewith. Preferably, the or each said valve means 
comprises a reed valve, or the like, having a flexible 
strip what normally covers the

A rotary compressor of the type comprising 
two rotors (18a,18b) which have inter-engaging lobes 

and which rotate in a housing (10) having two 
laterally intersecting bores defining variable volume 

compression chambers (12a,12b) which merge cyclically 
into one as the rotors rotate, one chamber (12b) 

containing an inlet port (16) adapted to be coupled to 
a suction pipe and the other chamber (12a) containing 

an outlet port arrangement, characterised in that the 
outlet port arrangement comprises at least one exit 

passage (20) controlled by a valve means (22) whose 
operation is responsive to the gas pressure across it. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein there is a plurality of such exit passages 

(20a,20b), each of which has a respective valve means 
(22) associated therewith. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 1 or 
2, wherein the or each said valve means comprises a 

reed valve, having a flexible strip (22) which 
normally covers the associated exit passage (20) but 

which can be deformed by differential gas pressures 
thereacross whereby to undercover that exit passage 

(20) and allow gas to pass through it. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 3, 
in which the reeds (22) associated with several valves 

are commonly connected at one end to an integral 
common portion which is fixed rigidly to the 

compressors housing. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein the exit passages (20) are arranged in two or 

more groups, with the exit passages in one said group 
lying along a first arc centred on the axis of that 

one of the two housing bores containing the inlet 
 

port, and with the exit passages (22) in a second 
group lying along a second arc centred at a point in 

the other housing bore but spaced laterally of the 
longitudinal axis of that bore. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the outlet port arrangement comprises an 

outlet valve (30) disposed on the rotational axis (34) 
of the rotor (18c) which rotates in the compression 

chamber (12a) containing said outlet port arrangement. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 6, 
wherein the outlet valve (30) is a circular plate 

valve having mutually opposed discs (36,40) which are 
spring biassed together but which can be relatively 

displaced axially by a predetermined gas pressure 
therecross to permit gas flow from the outlet chamber 

(12a) to the exit passage (33). 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 6 or 
7, wherein in order to provide a gas passage to the 

valve (30), the rotor (18c) in the outlet chamber 
(12a) has a cut-out portion (56) at its one end 

adjacent the valve (30). 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 6, 7 
or 8, wherein the face (44) of the outlet rotor (18c) 

opposed to the housing has a peripheral groove (46) 
containing a sealing strip (48) which engages a 

surface (47) of the compressor housing. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in claim 9, 
wherein there is disposed within the peripheral groove 

(46), beneath the sealing strip (48), a flexible tube 
(50) which energises and biasses the sealing strip 

(48) towards said surface (47) of the housing. 
A rotary compressor as claimed in any of 
claims 6 to 10, wherein the inlet port is disposed on 

the rotational axis of the rotor which rotates in the 
compression chamber containing said inlet port.
