<ABSTRACT>
A gravel pack well tool comprised of a workstring (18) having a gravel pack screen (21) thereon wherein the workstring (18) can be rotated without applying any substantial torque to the screen jacket (41) which forms part of the gravel pack screen (21). This allows the workstring (18) to be rotated in either direction during installation or removal of the gravel pack screen (21) without damaging the screen jacket (41). The gravel pack screen (21) is comprised of a fluid-permeable base pipe (40) having a screen jacket (41) rotatably mounted thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gravel pack
screens for use in well completions and in one of its
preferred aspects relates to a gravel pack screen adapted
to be rotated into a column of pre-placed gravel by a
workstring wherein the screen is comprised of a base pipe
having a screen jacket rotatably mounted thereon whereby
said workstring and base pipe can be rotated without
applying torque to the screen jacket.In wells which produce fluids from incompetent
subterranean formations (i.e.formations formed of an
unconsolidated matrix such as loose sandstone or the like)
or from formations which have been hydraulically-fractured
and propped, it is not uncommon for large volumes of
particulate material, e.g. sand, to dislodge from the
formation and be produced with the formation fluids. These
produced particulate materials are highly detrimental to
the operation of the well and cause erosion, plugging, etc.
of the well equipment which, in turn, leads to high
maintenance costs and considerable downtime of the well.
Accordingly, sand control methods are routinely employed in
these producing wells.One of the best known of these sand control
methods is one which is commonly referred to as "gravel
packing";see PETROLEUM PRODUCTION ENGINEERING, Oil Field
Development, L.C. Uren, Third Edition, McGraw-Hill Book
Co., N.Y., 1946, pps.575-588. Basically, a typical gravel
pack completion is comprised of a fluid-permeable liner
which is positioned in the wellbore adjacent the producing
formation and an aggregate or particulate material 
(collectively called "gravel") which fills the annulus
between the liner and the casing or the wall of the
wellbore. The gravel particles are sized to block or
filter out the formation particulates from the produced
fluids while the openings in the liner are sized to block
both the gravel and the particulate material from flowing
into the liner with the fluids.A variety of fluid-permeable liners are available
for used in gravel pack completions. One of the more
widely-used of these is commonly referred to as a "gravel
pack screen" or a "screened pipe". A typical, early gravel
pack screen was comprised of a perforated base pipe having
wire wrapped around and fixed thereto. The wire was coiled
around the outer periphery of the pipe in the form of a
spiral which, in turn, had a prescribed space between the
coils depending on the size of the gravel to be used in
forming the gravel pack. While these screens offered
little resistance to fluid flow, they were structurally
weak and susceptible

<CLAIMS>
A gravel pack screen (21) for use in well completions,
said screen comprising:


a fluid-permeable base pipe (40); and
a screen jacket (41) mounted on said base pipe (40),

characterised in that said screen jacket (41) is rotatable relative to said base pipe (40).
The gravel pack screen of claim 1 including;

a fluid-permeable, torque sleeve (55) positioned over said
screen jacket (41) and affixed to said base pipe; and
an auger blade (33) affixed along the external surface of
said torque sleeve.
A gravel pack screen as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said fluid-permeable
base pipe comprises;


a perforated pipe; and

   wherein said screen jacket (41) comprises:

wire formed in a spiral wherein the individual coils
of wire forming the spiral are spaced from each other by a

prescribed distance to thereby provide flow passages through
said screen jacket.
A gravel pack screen as claimed in claim 3 including:

a respective terminal (47,48) affixed to each end of said wire
forming said spiral, each terminal having a sliding seal (50,51) which

cooperates with said base pipe to prevent longitudinal flow
between said screen jacket (41) and said base pipe (40).
A gravel pack screen as claimed in any preceding claim including:

an upper and lower collar (43,44) affixed to said base pipe (40)
above and below said screen jacket (41), respectively, to fix said

screen jacket against longitudinal movement on said base pipe.
A gravel pack screen as claimed in claim 5 including:

a fluid permeable, torque sleeve (55) affixed to said upper and lower collars;
and
an auger blade (33) affixed to the external surface of said torque sleeve.
A gravel pack well tool comprising:

a workstring (18); and

   an auger-liner assembly connected at one end to said workstring (18), said
auger-liner assembly comprising:


a fluid-permeable liner in the form of a gravel pack screen (21) as claimed in
any one of claims 1 to 6;
a nose sub (26) affixed to the lower end of said fluid permeable liner; and
an auger blade (33) secured to and extending along said fluid-permeable liner
and said nose sub.
A gravel pack well tool as claimed in claim 7 including:

a bit (28) affixed on said leading edge of said nose sub (26).
A gravel pack well tool as claimed in claim 8 wherein said bit comprises:

a fish-tail bit (28).
A gravel pack well tool as claimed in claim 7, claim 8 or claim 9
including:


a blank tubular section (35) in said workstring above said auger-liner assembly;
and wherein
said auger blade (33) extends along and is affixed to said blank section (35).
