<ABSTRACT>
In order to seal telescopically nestable hydraulic cylinders which may only receive water as pressure medium, two sealing rings (12, 13) superimposed in the axial direction and having a circular cross-section are arranged in an annular groove (9) open towards the outer circumference of the cylindrical pressure piston (5), thus ensuring an optimal tightness without wearing. The groove (9), whose horizontal width is larger than the diameter of the sealing rings (12, 13), receives the water which serves as hydraulic liquid through channels (15, 16) which extend across the pressure piston (5), so that the sealing rings (12, 13) are pressed by the water pressure against the inner wall of the outlying hydraulic cylinder (2).
