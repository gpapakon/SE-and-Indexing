<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal cracking, and in 
particular to the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons 
containing 2 or more carbon atoms, eg ethane, propane, butane, 
LPG, and naphtha are generally cracked to produce olefins by 
passing a mixture of the hydrocarbon and steam through tubes, 
free of internal packing, heated to a high temperature in a 
furnace in the absence of a catalyst. The tubes typically have 
an inside diameter of 25 to 100 mm or more and the feedstock/ 
steam mixture passes through the tubes at a high flow rate so 
that the flow through the tubes is extremely turbulent so as to 
obtain good heat transfer. Typically the flow rate corresponds 
to a Reynolds No. of the order of 500,000 or more. The WO-A90/15119 describes a 
process for the cracking of hydrocarbons comprising 
passing a hydrocarbon feedstock and steam 
through an externally heated catalyst-free reaction 
zone having a heated surface to volume ratio above 3 cm-1. The presence of steam aids transfer of heat from the 
furnace walls to the hydrocarbon: the temperature of the tube 
walls in contact with the process stream is typically 100°C or 
more above that of the gas. The steam also decreases the 
formation of coke and acts as a diluent to decrease the partial 
pressure (since the cracking reaction to olefins is favoured by 
low hydrocarbon partial pressures). Typically 0.3 to 0.5 tonnes 
of steam are employed per tonne of hydrocarbon feedstock and the 
outlet pressure is typically below 2.5 bar abs, for example in 
the range 1.7 to 2.1 bar abs. However the use of steam is thermally inefficient and 
poses environmental problems. Thus steam is not completely inert 
under the conditions employed: normally the cracker effluent 
contains a small proportion of organic oxygenated compounds such 
as acetaldehyde, acetone, carboxylic acids, and phenols resulting 
from the reaction of steam with the hydrocarbon. After the 
cracking reaction, the effluent gas is cooled to condense the 
steam and as a result some of such compounds pass into the liquid 
water phase. While most of the water is recycled to form more 
steam, the presence of such compounds necessitates the addition 
of basic materials such as ammonia to the water to minimise 
corrosion. Also some of the water is bled off as a purge to  
  
 
avoid a build up of undesired components. This purge, typically 
amounting to about 10% of the condensed water, must be treated 
before disposal in order to avoid environmental problems. The tubes of the cracker are

hydrocarbons containing 2 or more carbon atoms and that 
contains less than 0.1 part by weight of steam per part by

A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the reactant stream 
passed through the reaction zone contains hydrogen or 

methane as a diluent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 the surfaces of 
the reaction zone exposed to the gas undergoing cracking 

exhibit essentially no catalytic activity for the reactions 
of hydrocarbons at the reaction temperature.

reaction zone exposed to the gas undergoing cracking are 

constructed from, or have a non-porous coating, of silica, 
silicon carbide, or copper. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
the reaction zone is heated by passing a heating medium 

through a heating zone separated from the reaction zone by 
a thin wall. 
A process as claimed in claim 5 wherein the heating zone 
has a coating of a combustion catalyst on its surfaces and 

a fuel/air mixture is passed through the heating zone so 
that at least part of the heat is produced by combustion 

occurring in the heating zone.

A process as claimed in claim 7 wherein reaction and heating 
zones are alternately provided by the spaces between 

adjacent plates of an assembly of parallel plates separated 
by spacers. 
A process as claimed in claim 8 wherein the plates, and 
hence reaction and heating zones, are of an elongated 

rectangular configuration, with the inlets and outlets for 

the reactant stream and heating medium positioned at 
diagonally opposed corners of their respective zones, and 

the inlets are at adjacent corners of one of the shorter 
rectangle sides. 
A process as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9 wherein the 
assembly is clamped together with inlet and outlet 

ducts and enclosed in a vessel to which a gas is charged at 
a pressure above the reaction pressure.
