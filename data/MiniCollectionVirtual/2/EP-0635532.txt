<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a polycarbonate which 
comprises performing a transesterification and a 

polycondensation reaction with a diarylcarbonate and 
dihydroxyaryl compound, in a reaction apparatus composed of 

stainless steel comprising at least 12 % by weight of Ni, 
and at least 22 % by weight of Cr, and having Fe as the 

remaining main component. A polycarbonate which has a good 
color, is stable to hydrolysis and resistant to heat-yellowing 

is the resulting product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for
preparing polycarbonates using a transesterification
process. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a method for preparing polycarbonates having a good
color and excellent physical properties, such as stability
to hydrolysis and heat yellowing resistance, etc.The transesterification process in which a
polycarbonate is prepared by reacting a diester carbonate
with a dihydroxyaryl compound, has rather simple
preparation steps, and is superior to the phosgene method
with respect to operation and cost. Further, the
transesterification process has recently been appreciated
from an environmental aspect since phosgene and methylene
chloride, which have strong toxicity, are not used.However, the transesterification process has not been
adopted in a large scale industrial process. The greatest
reason for this is that the physical properties, such as
color, stability to hydrolysis and heat yellowing
resistance of polycarbonate, prepared by using the
conventional transesterification process are inferior to
the properties of polycarbonate prepared by the phosgene 
process. There are several reasons for that these physical
properties are not good. One of the reasons is the
influence of the material of the reactors.To solve the problem, for example, U.S. Patent No.
4,383,092 describes a method for inhibiting color
development in a polymer by using a special material of
non-ferrous or non-stainless steel materials, such as
tantalum, chrome and nickel for the material of the
reactor. However, these metals are expensive, and do not
easily work, so the problem with the method in U.S. Patent
No. 4,383,092 is that the reactors are very expensive to
make. Further, in U.S. Patent No. 4,383,092, there is no
description of the physical properties, such as stability
to hydrolysis and heat yellowing resistance, etc., of the
resulting polymer.JP-A-4-72327 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application")
describes a method in which a metal material having a
copper and/or nickel content of 85 % by weight or more is
used as the surface which contacts the reaction mixture.
However, it has a problem that the reactors become
expensive. Also, there is no description of the physical
properties, such as stability to hydrolysis and heat
yellowing resistance, etc., of the resulting polymer.Further, there are descriptions of a method in which 
a material having a nickel and/or aluminum content of 60 %
by weight or more is used as the
