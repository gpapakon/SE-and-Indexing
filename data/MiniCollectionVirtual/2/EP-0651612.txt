<ABSTRACT>
A chewing gum base is provided which is free of wax as well as a method for producing same. In an embodiment, a wax-free gum base is provided having flavor release characteristics at least as good as similar bases including wax comprising an elastomer, polyvinyl acetate, an elastomer plasticizer, and a sufficient amount of oil to achieve flavor release characteristics that are at least as good as a similar gum base including wax.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved chewing
gum bases of the type which do not contain wax, and to
methods of preparing chewing gum bases which do not
contain wax.Recently, in the United Kingdom, the use of wax,
especially mineral hydrocarbon wax, in gum bases, has
come under scrutiny. There is a perception in the
United Kingdom that it may not be desirable to use wax
in gum bases. This perception could result in
possible regulatory issues, in the United Kingdom,
concerning the use of wax in gum base.Unfortunately, one cannot merely remove wax from
a gum base without possibly compromising certain
desirable characteristics of the resulting chewing gum
product. Wax provides a number of functions in the
gum base. For example, wax can influence the release
of flavor from the gum product. Furthermore, wax aids
in the curing of the finished gum product that is made
from the gum base. Additionally, wax contributes to
the shelf-life of the finished gum and its texture.Although some gum bases are known that do not
contain wax, they, the inventor believes, typically do 
not have the chew characteristics, in addition to
other characteristics, of typical chewing gums that
are created from wax containing gum bases.
Heretofore, gum bases without wax were not created in
response to any regulatory concerns, but rather, were
merely created as part of bases to achieve other ends,
for example, a non-tack gum. Therefore, in certain
instances, compromises with respect to certain
characteristics may have been made to achieve other
results, e.g., non-tack, reduced calories, etc.U.S. Patent 3,984,574, issued to Comollo,
discloses an abhesive chewing gum base in which the
non-tack properties were achieved by eliminating
conventional chewing gum base ingredients which were
found to contribute to chewing gum tackiness, and by
substituting non-tacky ingredients in place of the
conventional ingredients. Specifically, it was
discovered that three classes of materials account for
conventional chewing gum tackiness. These materials
are elastomers, resins, and waxes.In US-A-5023093, there is disclosed a
chewing gum base with reduced calorie content. The
central components of that gum base are 10-25%
polyvinyl acetate having a medium molecular weight of
about 35,000 to 55,000, 4.5% to about 10% acetylated
monoglyceride.In US-A-4387108, there is described a non-adhesive
chewing gum composition which does not adhere
to dentures, fillings or natural teeth consisting
essentially of an elastomer, at least one emulsifier
including
