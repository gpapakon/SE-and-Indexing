<ABSTRACT>
By a method and a plant according to the invention for the 
specific-gravity screening, especially of stone materials 

(12), the material (12) is dosed to the sieve (1) in such a 
manner that the heavy fraction (14) removed constitutes a 

predetermined part of the supplied material (12), and with 
an overflow plate (4) which separates the light fraction 

(13) together with the flushing water, and with a bulkhead 
(5) for the determination of the level of the water (15) in 

the vessel (6), specific-gravity screening can be carried 
out with a hitherto-unknown high degree of precision, and 

this is achieved even though the differences in the grain 
size and/or the specific gravity of the component parts are 

minimal. 
Aggregate material can hereby be screened for concrete 
mixtures which are completely free of the quality-decreasing 

types of flint which are of lower specific 
gravity than the preferred types of stone, and which can 

thus be screened out by means of the plant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for screening, especially
of stone material, where the material is supplied to the
uppermost end of an inclined sieve, said sieve being submerged
in a water-filled vessel, and where the water has a
pulsating movement through the sieve and also flows towards
the lowermost end of the sieve so that the material on the
sieve is fluidized by the upwardly-directed flow and
stratified on the sieve in a subsequent order by the
downwardly-directed and the longitudinal flow, and in such
a manner that the lightest particles lie uppermost and the
heaviest particles lowermost, whereby the material to be
separated as well as the heavy fraction are dosed and
whereby an overflow plate screens out the light fraction.The invention also relates to a plant for the execution of
the method.Methods of this kind following the density-screening
principle are known among other things for the screening of
stone materials which can be used as aggregate material in
concrete.For use in concrete, the stone material must be of very
high quality if damage due to so-called concrete deterioration
is to be avoided. It has been known for several years
that a content of flint, especially the lime chalco and
lime chalcedon types of flint, in stone materials for concrete,
causes a great deal of concrete deterioration,
which arises as a result of the porosity of the relevant
flint material. Lime chalco flint and lime chalcedon flint
are to be found in varying amounts in more or less all 
gravel and sand deposits both on land and at sea.A method for the removal of the relevant undesired components
from stone material is screening according to
specific gravity, in that the specific gravity is less for
flint than for "healthy" stone such as granite and quartz.Stone materials from 0-50 mm can be screened according to
specific gravity. It will always be advantageous, and in
many cases necessary out of regard for the classification,
to carry out the screening of size-screened stone materials,
which can be from 0-4 mm, 4-8 mm, 8-16 mm and 16-32
mm. Many earth stones and most of the sea stones can be
improved by screening so that they fulfil the requirements
for stone in material class M, which contains a max. of 5%
light particles, and others so that they fulfil the requirements
for material class A, which contains a max. of
1% light particles.A method as described in the initial part of the description
is known from GB-A-615 321, but the known method is not
satisfactory since it cannot separate the lighter

Method of the screening of especially stone material,
where the material is supplied to the uppermost end of an

inclined sieve, said sieve (1) being submerged in a water-filled
vessel (6), and where the water (15) has a pulsating

movement through the sieve (1) and also flows towards the
lowermost end of the sieve (1) so that the material on the

sieve (1) is fluidized by the upwardly-directed flow and
stratified on the sieve (1) in a subsequent order by the

downwardly-directed and the longitudinal flow, and in such
a manner that the lightest particles (13) lie uppermost and

the heaviest particles (14) lowermost, whereby the material
(12) to be separated as well as the heavy fraction (14) are

dosed and whereby an overflow plate (4) screens out the
light fraction (13)
, characterized
in that the heavy fraction (14) is dosed such that this
fraction (14) constitutes a predetermined part of the

supplied material (12), and
in that the level of the water (15) in the wessel (6) and
the water discharge via the overflow are regulated by a

bulkhead (5) above the overflow plate (4).
Screening plant for the execution of the method according
to claim 1, said plant comprising a sieve (1) being

submerged in a water-filled wessel (6), and where a
pulsating movement of the water (15) through the sieve (1)

is generated by compressed air, and the water (15) also
flows towards the lowermost end of the sieve (1), whereby

the material (12) to be separated as well as the heavy
fraction (14) are dosed, whereby an overflow plate (4)
