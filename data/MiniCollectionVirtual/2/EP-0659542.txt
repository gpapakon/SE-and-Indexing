<ABSTRACT>
A transfer device (1) for the second stage 
assembly (2) of a radial tire; the device presenting two 

pairs (33) of horizontal-axis rollers (37) defining a 
saddle (29) for supporting a toroidal body (4) 

positioned with a first axis (5) parallel to the axes 
(35) of the rollers (37) and housing the second stage 

assembly (2); the pairs (33) of rollers (37) being 
mounted on a platform (25) for rotating the toroidal 

body (4) about a second vertical axis (20), being 
operable for rotating the toroidal body (4) about the 

first axis (5), and being located an adjustable distance 
apart for moving the toroidal body (4) along the second 

axis (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transfer device 
for a radial tire second stage assembly. According to European Patent Application 
publication n. 0540048 filed by the present Applicant, a 
radial tire is produced by forming the second stage 
assembly of the tire on the inner surface of a toroidal 
body; separately forming the first stage assembly of the 
tire on inner rings supporting the bead portions of the 
first stage assembly; placing the first stage assembly 
inside the toroidal body and on the inner surface of the 
second stage assembly; forming the sidewalls of the 
tire, which are placed on the first stage assembly; and 
assembling annular walls for connecting the toroidal 
body and inner rings and so forming a mold suitable for 
use as a curing mold. The above assembly process involves continual, 
exact displacement of the second stage in relation to 
the first stage assembly. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a straightforward, low-cost, and at the same  
 
time relatively accurate, flexible device for performing 
all the above displacements. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a transfer device for the second stage assembly 
of a radial tire; the device comprising a carriage; a 
toroidal body supported on the carriage and housing said 
second stage assembly; and means for guiding said 
carriage; characterized by the fact that the carriage 
comprises a saddle for supporting the toroidal body with 
a first axis arranged substantially horizontally; a 
platform rotating about a second substantially vertical 
axis and supporting the saddle; and adjusting means for 
varying the width of the saddle and moving the toroidal 
body along the second axis. According to a preferred embodiment of the above 
device, the saddle comprises two roller means rotating 
about respective third substantially horizontal axes, 
and located a given distance apart; said adjusting means 
adjusting said distance within a given range. Preferably, at least one of said roller means is 
powered; and each of said roller means comprises two 
coaxial rollers; the toroidal body presenting two outer 
annular flanges; and each roller being engaged by a 
respective said outer annular flange. A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention 
will be described by way of example with reference to 
the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a side view of a preferred  
 
embodiment of the device according to the present 
invention; Figure 2 shows a partially sectioned plan view,
