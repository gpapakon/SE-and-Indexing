<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mold for molding a multi-stacked 
circular plate fan which is capable of producing a precise 
multi-stacked circular plate fan made of a multiplicity of fine and 
thin circular plates and a method for producing a multi-stacked 
circular plate fan using the above mold. In this specification, the fan means any fan which is applicable 
to various fluid machines for carrying out the treatment of a fluid 
such as air or water. The fluid machine is a concept which includes an 
air fan, a blower fan, a pump and a compressor. Conventionally, there is known a fan structure called a multi-stacked 
circular plate fan. The fan is made by stacking a multiplicity 
of thin circular plates with a fine gap therebetween and is featured by 
its excellent fan characteristic, namely, its extremely silent rotation 
during a fan operation. To explain the construction of such a fan concretely in view of 
Fig. 45 and Fig. 46, a multiplicity of thin annular circular plates 304 
are stacked on a circular mounting plate 306 with a desired gap to 
provide a multi-stacked circular plate fan F. The multi-stacked 
circular plate fan F produced in this manner can be used, for example, 
in a following way. The multi-stacked circular plate fan F is connected to the  
 
output shaft of a power-operated motor 300 mounted on one side of a fan 
casing 110 by way of a mounting plate which forms a part of the fan. The multi-stacked circular plate fan F is encased in a fan 
casing 310 which is provided with an air inlet opening at a portion 
thereof which faces a central hollow portion of the multi-stacked 
circular plate fan F and an air outlet opening at a side portion of the 
multi-stacked circular plate fan F. Due to such a construction, upon rotation of the multi-stacked 
circular plate fan F with the actuation of the power-operated motor 
300, the air is sucked into the fan casing 310 through the air inlet 
opening and then an air flow is generated within the multi-stacked 
circular plate fan and the air is charged through the air outlet 
opening. Since the multi-stacked circular plate fan F generates an air 
flow making use of a centrifugal force of air generated by a shearing 
force caused by a rotation of annular thin circular plates 304, the fan 
operation becomes extremely silent. Furthermore, by interposing a 
multiplicity of spacers between annular circular plates 304 in a 
circumferentially spaced apart manner, the blow-off amount of air can be 
increased. The manufacturing of the multi-stacked
