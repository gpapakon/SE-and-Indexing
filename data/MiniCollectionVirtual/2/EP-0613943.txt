<ABSTRACT>
A detergent additive for textile-softening detergents based on agglomerates of a smectic sheet silicate which are covered with fine particles is described. The detergent additive is characterised in that the agglomerates are at least partially covered with particles of a cation exchanger which pass through a screen with a mesh width of 45  mu m and which have an average particle size of less than 10  mu m, where the amount of the cation exchanger particles is 2 to 30% by weight (based on the dry weight of the uncovered agglomerates). The detergent additive can be used in conventional detergent formulations.

Detergent additive for fabric-softening detergents that 
is based on agglomerates of a smectite-type laminar silicate 

that are coated with fine particles, characterized in that the 
agglomerates are coated with particles of a cation exchanger 

that pass through a screen with a mesh size of 45 µm and have 
an average particle size of less than 10 µm, the amount of 

cation exchanger particles used being 2-30 wt-%, calculated on 
the dry weight of the uncoated agglomerates. 
Detergent additive as in Claim 1, characterized in that 
the cation exchanger particles have a degree of whiteness of 

75-96% (R 457, Elrepho). 
Detergent additive as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the agglomerates contain 5-20 wt-% and preferably 7-13 wt-% 

of residual moisture. 
Detergent additives as in any one of Claims 1-3, 
characterized in that the cation exchanger particles are used 

in an amount of 5-15 wt-%, calculated on the dry weight of the 
uncoated agglomerates. 
Detergent additive as in any one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that the cation exchanger has a calcium 

binding capacity of 120-200 mg of CaO per gram. 
Detergent additive as in any one of Claims 1-5, 
characterized in that the cation exchanger is a sodium 

aluminium silicate and preferably a zeolite.  
 
Detergent additive as in any one of Claims 1-5, 
characterized in that the cation exchanger is a synthetic 

sodium silicate that has a laminar structure. 
Process for the preparation of a detergent additive as in 
any one of Claims 1-7, characterized in that a smectite-type 

laminar silicate in powder form is agglomerated by adding to 
it enough water to make the total water content about 20-40 wt-%, 

calculated on the dry powder, the wet agglomerate is dried, 
if appropriate, to a residual moisture content of about 5-20 

wt-% and preferably 7-13 wt-%, and the agglomerate is mixed - 
essentially without any further comminution - with the cation 

exchanger in powder form until the latter has been completely 
deposited on the surface of the agglomerates, after which the 

mixture is dried, if this has not been done before. 
Detergent containing a detergent additive as in any one 
of claims 1-7, prepared by the process described in Claim 8.
