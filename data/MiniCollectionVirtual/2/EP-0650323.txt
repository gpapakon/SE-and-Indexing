 ADHERENT STARCH GRANULESDescriptionCross-Reference to Related ApplicationThe present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/730,763, filed July 16, 1991, the disclosure of which i incorporated herein by reference.Technical Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to adherent starch-based granules, a proce of incorporating a biological or chemical substance such as a pest control agent into such a granule and the use of adherent granules to decrease the populatio of a pest of a living organism.Background of the InventionMyriad approaches have been pursued to control pests. Many of these methods and compositions are directed to control of pests that attack plants, m notably commercially valuable plants. Although much current agricultural research has pest control as its objective, pest destruction of plants and plant products is still a major problem.Pesticides, biological or chemical agents that kill pests, have been encapsulated in starch which was crosslinked with borate, calcium, or xanthide, thereby producing a matrix that can be processed into granules of desired sizes and densities (Shasha et al., 1984; Trimnell et al., 1982; Wing et al., 1983).However, these methods cannot be used for most living organisms because the reagents and conditions are too harsh for their survival.Controlled release by means of starch-based encapsulating materials can also be accomplished without the use of chemical crosslinking reactions. In U. Patent No. 2,876,160, Schoch et al. disclose such a method which employs modified, amylose-free starches at concentrations up to 65% solids for embedd water-insoluble materials. 

 In PCT Int. Appl. WO 85/04074, Flashinski et al. disclose two methods o preparing a starch gel matrix containing an insecticide. The insecticide is either coextruded with a dilute, aqueous dispersion of starch, or the starch is first partially cooked in an extruder prior to cold-blending with the insecticide. In either case, the product is recovered and used as an aqueous gel.In U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,687, Sair et al. disclose the application of shearing stress, vigorous mechanical working, and heat to distribute an active agent into a enveloping matrix of chemically modified starches, gums, and proteins in the presence of a limited quantity of water. Proteins are used for slow-release matrices; modified starches are used for rapid release.Similarly, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,922,354, Galuzzi et al. disclose the use of hig shear mixing to incorporate active
