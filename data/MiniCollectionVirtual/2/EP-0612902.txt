<ABSTRACT>
The present application relates to an interior actuation mechanism for vehicle doors, with an actuating lever (4) mounted pivotably in a bearing part (2) via a pivot mounting (8) and operatively connectable to a door lock for opening the door, whilst the bearing part (2) is to be fastened especially unreleaseably to a door interior trim. The actuating lever (4) is releaseably connected or connectable to the bearing part (2) via catch means (22) resiliently movable in the axial direction of the pivot mounting (8) and forming integral parts of the pivot mounting (8).

<CLAIMS>
An internal actuating device for vehicle doors, with an 
actuating lever which is mounted by way of a pivot bearing so as 

to be pivotable in a bearing part and which is capable of 
operative connection to a door lock for opening the door, wherein 

the bearing part is to be fixed, particularly non-releasably, to 
an interior lining of the door, characterized in that the 

actuating lever (4) is or can be releasably connected to the 
bearing part (2) by way of stop means (22) which are resiliently 

movable in the axial direction of the pivot bearing (8) and which 
form components of the pivot bearing (8). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
pivot bearing (8) has as its pivot axis two axially spaced 

journals (26, 28) which are connected to the bearing part (2) and 
which each engage in a bearing opening (24) in the actuating 

lever (4), wherein as stop means (22) at least one of the 
journals (26) is disposed so that it is resiliently movable in 

the axial direction in such a way that it can be moved out of its 
position where it engages in the bearing opening (24) into an 

installation or dismantling position outside the bearing opening 
(24). 
A device according to Claim 2, characterized in that one 
journal (28) is rigidly connected to the bearing part (2) and the 

other journal (26) is disposed on a resiliently flexible spring 
arm (30) connected to the bearing part (2), the journals (26, 28) 

preferably being disposed facing one another. 
A device according to one or more Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the resiliently movable stop means (22) can 

be locked by a locking part (34) in a position where they retain 
the actuating lever (4), the locking part (34) preferably being 

capable of being releasably connected to the bearing part (2),  
 

particularly capable of being fitted thereon by way of stop 
connections (36). 
A device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that 
the locking part (34) has a receiving part (38) for the free end 

of the spring arm (30) having the movable journal (26) in such 
a way that the spring arm (30) is locked against resilient 

bending. 
A device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that 
the locking part (34) is a component of a cover part (6) which 

can be connected by way of the stop connections (36) to the 
bearing part (2), covers the bearing part (2) on the inner face 

of the internal lining of the door and has a trough-like 
depression (42) in the region of a gripping portion (14) of the 

actuating lever (4). 
A device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that at least one of the journals (26, 28) has 

a conically tapering shape, and the associated bearing opening 
(24) also preferably has a correspondingly conical construction. 
A device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that the actuating lever (4) has an inclined 

run-on surface (48) in a region arranged, in the installation 
direction, before the bearing opening (24) for the movable 

journal (26), and/or that at least the movable journal (26) has 
an inclined run-on surface for the actuating lever (4) in such 

a way that during the installation of the actuating lever (4) an 
automatic movement of the resilient journal (26) over the 

inclined run-on surface(s) (48) is effected. 
A device according to one or more of Claims 3 to 8, 
characterized in that the spring arm (30) has on its free end an 

actuating portion (50) for application of a tool, e.g. a 
screwdriver.
