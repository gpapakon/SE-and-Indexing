<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cartoning machine for large-format cuboid bundles (10), with an elevator conveyor (1), drivable in steps and passing through a plurality of successive standstill positions, for the reception of erected carbon blanks (4) open on both sides and having flaps (6, 7, 8, 9) projecting laterally on both sides, with folders, arranged adjacent to the conveyor (1), for folding round the flaps (6, 7, 8, 9), with a pushing-in device for pushing in the bundles (10) on the head side, and with a glue-coating device (12), the conveyor (1) comprising two mutually opposite groups of rotating belts (2) which carry holding fences (5) for holding the erected carbon blank (4) on the topside and underside.

Cartoning machine for cuboidal, large-format 
bundle packs (10), having a conveyor (1) which can be 

driven in a stepwise manner, runs through a plurality of 
successive standstill positions and is intended for 

receiving assembled carton blanks (4) which are open on 
both sides and have flaps (6, 7, 8, 9) projecting laterally 

on both sides, having folding means which are 
arranged adjacent to the conveyor (1) and are intended 

for folding over the flaps (6, 7, 8, 9), having a push-in 
device for pushing the bundle packs (10) into the head 

side of the assembled carton blank, and having a glueing 
device (12), the conveyor (1) having retaining elements 

for the carton blanks (4), characterized in that the 
conveyor (1) comprises two groups, arranged opposite one 

another, of circulating belts (2) which each bear, as 
retaining elements, retaining bars (5) for retaining the 

assembled carton blank (4) at the front and rear, the 
retaining bars (5) which act at the rear of the carton 

blank (4) being located in the deflection region of the 
belts (2) in the push-in position of the assembled carton 

blanks (4), and the retaining bars (5) which act at the 
front of the carton blank (4) not being located in the 

deflection region of the belts (2) in this push-in 
position. 
Cartoning machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the belts (2) are toothed belts. 
Cartoning machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the glueing device (12) is arranged 

between two standstill positions of the conveyor (1).  
 
Cartoning machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that pressure-exerting plates (15) 

for the flaps (6, 7, 8, 9) are provided in that standstill 
position of the conveyor (1) which follows the 

glueing device (12). 
Cartoning machine according to any of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that, between two standstill positions 

of the conveyor (1), in each case one adhesive-tape 
means (16) opens on either side of said conveyor. 
Cartoning machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that assembled carton blanks (4) 

and/or bundle packs (10) can be fed from opposite sides. 
Cartoning machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that there is provided a film-welding 

device for producing bundle packs (10) welded in a 
section (24) of a tubular film (20). 
Cartoning machine according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the film-welding device has a welding and 

cutting station (23) for a flat tubular film (20) for 
producing a film section (24) which is closed at one end. 
Cartoning machine according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterized in that the film-welding device has a 

turret (27) which can be driven in a stepwise manner and 
has receiving means for an open film section (24) which 

is closed at one end by a weld seam, the receiving means 
being formed by bars (30) which bound the receiving space 

for a bundle pack (10). 
Cartoning machine according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that there are provided suckers (26) for 

opening at the non-welded end the film sections (24) 
which are closed at one end by a weld seam and for 

pushing these onto a receiving means of the turret (27). 
Cartoning machine according to Claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in that the bars (30) are angle bars. 
Cartoning machine according to one of Claims 9 to 
11, characterized in that the bars (30) are spreading 

bars. 
Cartoning machine according to one of Claims 7 to 
12, characterized in that provided in a welding station  

 
for closing the non-welded end of the film sections (24) 

which are closed at one end by a weld seam and are filled 
with the bundle pack (10) are tensioners (35) which 

engage in a film projection (24a), at opposite sides 
thereof, and can be moved apart.
