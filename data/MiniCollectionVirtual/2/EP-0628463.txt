<ABSTRACT>
A truck is described having wheels (4) that are fixed to the 
front part of a bed (1) with arms (3) interposed therebetween 

so freely as to move up and down and designed to roll backwards 
and forwards in the longitudinal direction when in contact with 

the ground, wheels (5) that are fixed to the arms (3) with 
bearing arms (30) interposed therebetween so freely as to move 

up and down and designed to roll right and left in the lateral 
direction when in contact with the ground, and a rear wheel 

that is fixed to the bed (1) with a hydraulic pressure cylinder 
interposed therebetween and capable of changing its direction 

by the turning of a pumping handle which works the cylinder. An 
arm (40) of which one end is rotatably joined to the bed (1) 

with a fulcrum link (42) interposed therebetween is provided to 
the inside of the bed (1) and joined to one end of a swiveling 

arm (45), of which the other end is rotatably joined to one of 
the arms (3) so that the wheels (4) can be raised up from the 

ground by the movement of the arm (40) in association with the 
rising movement of the bearing arms (30) coupled with the 

movement of the arms (3) to lower the wheels (5) back down onto 
the ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a truck which has front
wheels provided to under the front part of a forked bed
and a rear wheel provided to under a hydraulic pressure
cylinder for raising or lowering the bed.As disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application
Publication No. 58-23740 (JP-U-83-23740), a truck that can be
moved backward and forward in the longitudinal direction by
a pair of wheels or right and left in the lateral direction
by another pair of wheels both the pairs of which are
rotatably fixed to under the front part of the bed of
the truck with arms put in between and is provided with
a rear wheel which is fixed to under a hydraulic pressure
cylinder and capable of turning to the right and the left
with a pumping handle which also works the hydraulic
pressure cylinder has been known prior to this invention.In the prior art, the paired wheels of the truck 
which roll in the lateral direction are raised up from
the ground by the force of a spring connecting the bed
and the arms when the other paired wheels come in touch
with the ground. However, the spring is put in so narrow
space between the side of the bed and the arms that its
size and length have to be limited per se. Briefly, a
stronger spring with greater diameter and greater number
of turns is in fact needed but cannot be used in such
a conventional truck due to the narrow space. Since the
spring has to be smaller and weaker than it should be,
it cannot bear long hard works and sometimes is liable
to break down by oxidation corrosion. Therefore, more
than one springs are actually needed to raise the wheels
and, accordingly, there are problems in safety as well
as in its structure.These disadvantages are overcome by the truck defined
in claim 1. As the truck of this invention is designed
in the above mentioned way, the arm and the swiveling
arm can be put even in narrow space between the side of
the bed and the bearing arms and both the wheels are moved
for sure, which should improve the durability of the truck
and the safety of workers to operate the truck more widely
than before.An example of this invention will be described below
in more detail with reference to the attached drawing,
in which:-

<CLAIMS>
A truck, comprising:

a bed (1) having downwardly extending sides,
a rear wheel (10) capable of changing its direction by the
turning of a pumping handle (21),
a hydraulic pressure cylinder located between the rear
wheel (10) and the bed (1) being worked by the pumping handle

(21), and
at least one lifting mechanism located at a front part of
the bed (1), comprising:


a first wheel (4) for movement of the truck in a first
direction parallel to the bed's (1) extension from the rear

wheel (10),
first arms (3) pivotably joined to the bed (1) are
provided, to which the first wheel (4) is rotatably connected,
bearing arms (30) pivotably joined to the axis (29) of the
first wheel (4),
a second wheel (5) for movement of the truck in a direction
substantially perpendicular to the first direction, which is

rotatably connected to the bearing arms (30),
characterized by
a second arm (40) that is inside the bed by being provided
between an inner face of a side of the bed (1) and one of said

bearing arms (30); one end of said second arm (40) being
joined to the bed (1) with a fulcrum link (42) said second arm

(40) being further joined to one end of a swiveling arm (45)
of which the other end is pivotably joined to the wheel axis

(29) or one of said first arms (3),

   wherein the lifting of the bed with the first wheel (4)
touching the ground lowers the second wheel (5) towards the

ground, and further lifting leads to engagement of the first
arms (3) with the bearing arms (30) to lift the first wheel

(4) from the ground, while the second wheel (5) touches the
ground.
A truck as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the bed (1) is a
forked bed, which is provided with two lifting mechanisms.
A truck as claimed in one of the above claims, wherein
the lifting mechanism is operated by connecting rods (26)

which are connected to the hydraulic pressure cylinder and
pivotably joined to the first arms (3) at a location above the

first arms' (3) joints to the bed (1).
A truck as claimed in one of the above claims, wherein
a stopper (35) is provided to the first arms (3) to be engaged

with one end (34) of the bearing arms (30) when the second
wheel (5) touches the ground.
A truck as claimed in one of the above claims, wherein
a bolt (47) is provided to the bearing arms (30) to be engaged

with a cam recess (40a) of the second arm (40) while only the
first wheel(s) 4 touch(es) the ground.
A truck as claimed in one of the above claims, wherein
a generally square freame (31) is pivotably joined to the

bearing arms (30) and wherein the second wheel (5) is
rotatably connected to the inside of the square frame (31).
A truck as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the bearing arms
(30) comprise stopper bolts (36, 37) for restricting the

rotational movement of the square frame (31).
