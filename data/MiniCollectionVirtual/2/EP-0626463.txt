<ABSTRACT>
The heat- and creep-resistant steel has a martensitic microstructure obtained by a tempering treatment process. The composition of the steel in percent by weight is as follows: 0.001 - 0.05 of carbon 0.05 - 0.5 of silicon 0.05 - 2.0 of manganese 0.05 - 2.0 of nickel 8.0 - 13.0 of chromium 0.05 - 1.0 of molybdenum 1.00 - 4.0 of tungsten 0.05 - 0.5 of vanadium 0.01 - 0.2 of niobium 2.0 - 6.5 of cobalt 0.1 - 0.3 of nitrogen the remainder being iron and unavoidable impurities. Such a steel can be produced by forging, casting or powder-metallurgical means. Components fabricated from this have a high strength and ductility at room temperature and are distinguished at temperatures of 600@C and higher by a very high creep resistance and an unusually high oxidation resistance. They can therefore be employed with advantage as components, which can be subjected to high mechanical and thermal stresses, in steam power stations and/or gas power stations.
