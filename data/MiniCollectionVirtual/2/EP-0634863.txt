<ABSTRACT>
Thin film coating that may be applied to various optical elements and a method for 
controlling the size of the imaging spot from multiwavelength sources in an optical path 

A selective optical element (40) made in accordance with the principles of the present 
invention comprises an optical surface. Upon the surface, thin film coatings (44-50) are 

deposited that define zones (Zone 1-Zone 4) of transmission, each zone transmits a desired 
wavelength band Beyond this zone (Zone 1), the surface is effectively opaque (42) to a 

specified wavelength band. The zones (Zone 1-Zone 4) for each wavelength are 
individually calculated to give an effective aperture for each wavelength such that the spot 

size for all wavelengths meet user specifications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to optical elements for electronic print heads
having multi-wavelength operation, such as for use in full color xerographic printing
systems, and in particular, to selective optical elements that create spot sizes of specified
areas for various wavelengths focused on the surface of a photoreceptor.The fundamental techniques of xerographic printing are established and well known
in the art. Basically, a latent image is formed on a charged photoreceptor by sweeping a
modulated laser beam across the surface of the photoreceptor. This latent image is then
used to create a permanent image by transferring and fusing toner, that is electrostatically
attracted to the latent image, onto a recording medium, usually plain paper.Extending xerography to include full color printing presents a set of unique problems.
For example, the xerographic system must "know" which colors to apply to the recording
medium in response to particular laser markings. Many methods have been devised in the
current art to overcome this problem.For example, some xerographic systems apply only one wavelength of light to the
surface of the photoreceptor apparatus. The photoreceptor, in turn, interprets the single
wavelength as a different color to be applied to the recording medium depending on the
particular time or location the light reaches the photoreceptor. A typical system of this
type uses a multi-pass method of producing full color prints. The system produces a single
wavelength of light that passes across the surface of the photoreceptor several times -
each
pass interpreted as a separate color. To supply a different color per pass, a different
colored toner is applied to the surface of the photoreceptor which is then transferred to
the recording medium. This procedure is repeated until each desired color is laid down.The main disadvantage of this system is speed. Executing multiple passes over the
photoreceptor to produce one page of print is slow. Theoretically, if all the different colors
could be laid down on the recording medium in one pass, then printing could be sped up
by a factor equal to the number of passes.Accordingly, there are xerographic systems, called "tandem" systems, that lay down
all desired colors in a single pass over the surface of the photoreceptor. The architecture of
a typical tandem system comprises several independent optical/xerographic subsystems
running concurrently Generally, there are as many subsystems as there are desired colors
for printing. In a typical
