<ABSTRACT>
The process is intended for data transfer between two interrogation and response stations (Q,R) usually having a high relative speed, in which at least the reply station (R) has a delay line with reflection points, preferably a surface wave component (OFW). The component (OFW) has a substrate suitable for conducting surface waves on which there are an interdigital transducer (IDW) and at least one reflector (RFT). Here, interrogation pulses are transmitted from the interrogation station (Q) to the response station (R). The modulation of these interrogation pulses in the interrogation station (Q) and the corresponding response pulses in the response station (R) result in the transfer between the interrogation and response stations (Q, R) not only of identification signals but also of variable data. The use of expansion and compression processes thereby permits data transmission with low transmission power and greater freedom from interference. It is particularly advantageous to equip the reflectors (RFT) with variable and/or connectable complex resistors. This makes it possible to control and optimise the reflection behaviour of the reflectors (RFT) as desired.

Method of data transmission between an interrogator (Q) from which
interrogation signals are transmitted, and a transponder (R) from which, on

receipt of an interrogation signal, a reply signal is transmitted onto which a
code word used to identify the transponder (R) is imprinted, said code word

being decoded in the interrogator (Q) after demodulation of the reply signal,
whereby at least the transponder (R) has a SAW delay line (OFW) provided

with a substrate suitable for conducting surface acoustic waves, said delay line
being provided with reflection points (IDW; IDWa, ..., IDWd; RFT) of which

at least one reflection point (IDW, IDWa, ..., IDWd) is used to inject
interrogation signals and at least one reflection point (IDW) is used to couple

out reply signals which are transmitted, in the form of a pulse sequence, back
to the interrogator (Q) where they are demodulated or decoded, 
characterised in
that
 the interrogation signals transmitted to the transponder (R) are phase- or
frequency-modulated and that the transponder (R) is fed variable data (vd-b)

which is imprinted on the reply signal in addition to the code word so that, in
addition to a first data channel for transmitting permanently allocated code

words, a second data channel is created for transmitting variable data (vd-b).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the pulse sequence
transmitted back to the interrogator (Q) is coded or modulated in the

transponder (R) as a function of the data (vd-b) to be transmitted to the
interrogator (Q).
Method according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the pulse sequence
coupled out at the delay line (OFW) is phase-modulated in a modulator (PM)

as a function of the data to be transmitted (vd-b) and transmitted back to the
interrogator (Q), whereby all or only individual pulses of the pulse sequence 

coupled out at the SAW delay line (OFW) are phase-modulated, and
unmodulated pulses are if necessary used as a reference for demodulation of

the transmitted pulse sequence.
Method according to Claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the reflection

varying a connected ohmic or complex impedance (IMP1, ..., IMP5; SW1, ...,
SWn; IMPC-I) as a function of the data (vd-b) to be transmitted, such that a

sequence of pulses of identical or differing intensity is produced in response to
an interrogation signal.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that

expanded carrier-frequency interrogation pulses are used whose expansion

direction is selected such that, for a data bit "1" to be transmitted, the
expansion is from a frequency f1 to a frequency f2 and, for a data bit "0" to be

transmitted, the expansion is from the frequency f2 to the frequency f1, or that
b) the expanded pulse is subdivided into several areas (B1, ..., Bn) of which at
least one is marked as a function of the variable data (vd-b) to be transmitted,

phase-modulated at the corresponding positions and that the signals are

decoded after transmission.
Method of data transmission between an interrogator (Q) from which
