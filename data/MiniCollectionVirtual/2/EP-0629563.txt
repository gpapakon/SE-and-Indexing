<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for dispensing articles. According to one aspect of the invention a device for 
dispensing articles comprises a store for articles, and 
dispensing means operable to dispense an article from the store, 
operation of the dispensing means being arranged to move an 
article from a holding position to a dispensing position. The dispensing means may comprise first and second parts 
between which the article is received in the holding position, 
movement of the first and second parts moving the article to the 
dispensing position. There may be a lost motion connection between the first and 
second parts so that dispensing movement of the first part only 
moves the second part when an article is in the holding 
position. There may be means for disturbing articles in the 
store. The disturbing means may be operated by the dispensing 
means. There may be a connection between the disturbing means and 
the dispensing means arranged to operate the disturbing means on 
operation of the dispensing means to dispense an article and on 
movement of the dispensing means to a position to receive the 
next article to be dispensed. The connection may comprise a 
rack and a toothed wheel. The store may comprise a storage region with an outlet 
passage leading to the holding position and arranged to receive 
articles in a desired orientation. The disturbing means may 
comprise rotary means having elements extending into the store. 
The rotary means may have elements extending into the store 
region adjacent an inlet to the outlet passage. The store 
region may comprise walls inclined towards the inlet, and the 
elements move in the store region adjacent the walls. The device may have a housing having a periphery defining 
corners, and the dispensing means comprises an operating member  
 
at a corner. There may be security means movable between an 
operative position in which operation of the dispensing means is 
resisted to an operative position in which operation of the 
dispensing means is permitted. There may be means for releasably holding the security 
means in the inoperative position. There may be means for 
releasably holding the security means in the operative position. 
The device may comprise a housing, the security means comprising 
a member movably supported in the housing and may be sized to be 
hand-held. According to another aspect of the invention a device for 
dispensing articles comprises a store for articles, means 
operable to dispense an article from the store, and

<CLAIMS>
A device for dispensing articles comprising: 

i) a container for articles, 
ii) a housing for receiving the container comprising a 
storage region for articles, 
iii) dispensing means operable to dispense an article from 
the storage region, operation of the dispensing means being 

arranged to move an article from a holding position to a 
dispensing position, 
iv) means responsive to operation of the dispensing means 
for counting the number of operations, the counting means being 

operable only when an article is dispensed, and 
v) means for resisting removal of the container from the 
housing until all the articles have been dispensed. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the dispensing 
means comprises first and second-parts between which the article 

is received in the holding position, movement of the first and 
second parts moving the article to the dispensing position, and 

including a lost motion connection between the first and second 
parts so that dispensing movement of the first part only moves 

the second part when an article is in the holding position. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the storage region 
has an outlet passage leading to the holding position, the 

outlet passage being arranged to receive articles in a desired 
orientation. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, comprising means operated 
by operation of the dispensing means for disturbing articles in 

the storage region, the disturbing means comprises rotary means 
having elements extending into the storage region adjacent an 

inlet to the outlet passage. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, including security means 
movable between an inoperative position in which operation of 

the dispensing means is resisted to an operative position in 
which operation of the dispensing means is permitted. 
A device as claimed in Claim 5, including means for 
releasably holding the security means in the inoperative 

position or in the operative position. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the dispensing 
means comprises first and second parts between which an article 

to be dispensed is received in the holding position, and a lost 
motion connection between the first and second parts so that the 

second part moves with the first part only when an article is 
received between the first and second parts, the counting means 

being responsive to movement of the second part. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, in which the means for 
resisting removal comprises cooperable means of the housing and 

container responsive to receipt of the container by the housing, 
wherein first and second formations on the container cooperate 

respectively with first and second formations in the housing, 
engagement of the first formations on receipt of the container 

moving the second housing formation to cooperate with the second 
container formation to resist removal of the container, 

operation of the dispensing means to dispense all the articles 
moving the second housing formation out of cooperation with the 

second container formation. 
A device as claimed in Claim 8, in which the first 
container formation is carried by bi-stable means so as to be 

movable between an operative position in which the first 
container formation can cooperate with the first housing 

formation and an inoperative position, the first container 
formation being moved to the inoperative position prior to 

removal of the container from the housing. 
A device as claimed in Claim 8 comprising eject means 
operable to eject the container from the housing when the 

resisting means is rendered ineffective on dispensing of all the 
articles. 
A device as claimed in Claim 8, in which the eject means 
comprises spring means energised by receipt of the container by 

the housing. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the container for 
articles has an outlet, a closure for the outlet, the housing 

and container having cooperable means which open the outlet on 
receipt of the container by the housing. 
A device as claimed in Claim 12 in which the closure is a 
flexible membrane, and the housing comprises means operable on 

insertion of the container into the housing to cut the membrane 
and to move the cut membrane from the outlet, the cut membrane 

being pushed into a recess in the container. 
A device as claimed in Claim 13, in which the outlet has 
four sides and the membrane extends beyond the sides of the 

outlet and the means cuts the membrane along and outside three 
sides and pushes the membrane along and outside the fourth side 

to move the cut membrane into the recess.
