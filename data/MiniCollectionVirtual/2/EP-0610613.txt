<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in fire 
hydrant apparatus of the type which are installed on 
building walls and which are utilized for fire 
fighting activity. One type of fire hydrant apparatus incorporating a 
hose is described in Japanese Utility Model 
Application Laid-Open No. 57-165154 and has been 
developed and commercially applied. This hose reel-type fire hydrant apparatus is of the 
type in which the fire hose by virtue of its 
construction is self-supporting in a circular 
cross-section (hereinafter called a shape-retaining 
fire hose) and is wound on a hose reel mounted 
rotatably on a supporting frame. The base end of said 
fire hose is connected to a rotary joint of the hose 
reel.  
 In fire fighting a hydrant valve is first opened to 
cause water to be supplied through a conduit pipe to 
the rotary joint of the hose reel. Then, the fire 
hose is drawn by pulling the hose while holding a 
discharge nozzle connected to a head of the fire hose, 
and discharging toward a fire point is performed. Said hose reel-type fire hydrant apparatus has many 
advantages in that pulling the fire hose allows the 
hose reel to be rotated and the fire hose to be very 
smoothly drawn, whereby discharging can be started 
promptly, and in that using the shape-retaining fire 
hose allows a smooth discharging to be performed even 
in a condition that part of the hose is wound on the 
hose reel. However, said hose reel-type fire hydrant apparatus 
has a problem that the conduit pipe fixed to the wall 
of a building must be connected to the base end of the 
fire hose rotating with the hose reel, thereby 
requiring a rotary joint with a complex structure of 
increased cost.  
 The water discharged from the fire hydrant valve flows 
through the conduit pipe and the rotary joint into the 
base end of the fire hose, so that the water flowing 
pass becomes complex compared with a case where the 
base end of the fire hose is connected to the outlet 
of the fire hydrant valve. This causes a problem that 
the installing of fire hydrant apparatus and the 
assembling of water pass require much labour. Further, in a fire hydrant apparatus in which a hose 
reel is mounted to a horizontally rotatable supporting 
arm so as to move the hose reel from the inside to the 
outside of the wall in performing fire fighting 
activity, there is a problem that part of the passage 
(for instance, the corridor) is blocked by the hose 
reel in performing fire fighting activity, thereby 
obstructing fire fighting activity and

<CLAIMS>
A fire hydrant apparatus comprising a 
coiled shape-retaining hose (3), the inner end of the 

hose being connected to the hydrant (2) wherein the 
hose is wound as an unsupported spiral so that the 

nozzle end is withdrawable axially characterised in 
that a holder (4) for supporting the front of the hose 

comprises spaced vertically extending rollers (4(a)) 
between which the hose is withdrawn. 
A fire hydrant apparatus according to 
Claim 1 wherein the hose spiral is contained within a 

separate box (16) removably located within the 
apparatus, the front of the box having an aperture 

(17) through which the hose is withdrawn characterised 
in that the vertical side edges of the aperture (17) 

are defined by the rollers (4(a)) between which the 
hose is withdrawn.
