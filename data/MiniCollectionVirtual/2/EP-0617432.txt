<ABSTRACT>
A composite electrical insulator includes a 
metal fitting (3, 4) fixedly secured to a fiber-reinforced 

plastic rod (1) at one end thereof. The rod 
has a stress-relieved zone (8) situated opposite to the 

metal fitting (3, 4), and formed by a heat treatment of 
the rod (1) after an end portion of the rod (1) has been 

inserted into a bore (5) in the metal fitting (3, 4) and 
the metal fitting (3, 4) fixedly secured to the rod (1). 

The heat treatment of the rod (1) is performed at a 
temperature which is not lower than a heat transition 

temperature of a matrix resin of the fiber-reinforced 
plastic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
composite electrical insulator wherein a metal fitting 
is fixedly secured to a fiber-reinforced plastic rod at 
one end thereof. A composite electrical insulator with such a 
constitution is known, e.g., from U.S. Patent 
No. 4,654,478, wherein one end portion of the fiber-reinforced 
plastic rod is inserted into the bore in a 
sleeve portion of the metal fitting and the metal 
fitting is then fixedly secured to the plastic rod. 
To this end, the metal fitting is compressed radially 
inwardly onto the plastic rod so as to firmly clamp the 
rod. That is to say, by compressing the metal fitting 
radially inwardly, that region of the plastic rod 
situated opposite to the metal fitting is uniformly 
clamped to integrally connect the metal fitting with the 
plastic rod and prevent withdrawal of the plastic rod 
from the fitting even under a large tensile force. In order to satisfy a severe requirement for a  
 
high tensile strength, the metal fitting is usually 
comprised of a high tension steel or ductile cast iron. 
However, due to the rigidity of the metal fitting which 
is considerably higher than that of the fiber-reinforced 
plastic rod, even a slight unevenness in the outer 
surface of the rod end portion or the inner surface of 
the bore in the metal fitting may cause a local 
deformation in adjacent outer surface region of the rod, 
thereby giving rise to a considerable residual internal 
stresses. In this instance, when the insulator is 
applied with an external force, typically an axial 
tensile force, the internal stress is multiplied in the 
end portion of the rod which is clamped within the 
sleeve, causing a high degree of stress concentration 
and thereby giving rise to damages or breakage of the 
rod within a relatively short period. It has thus been 
considered necessary to perform highly accurate and 
precise machining with respect to the inner surface of 
the bore in the metal fitting and the outer surface of 
the rod end portion. Needless to say, such machining 
often makes it difficult to improve the manufacturing 
productivity and reduce the cost of the insulators. Similar problems may arise also when the 
radially inwardly directed compression of the fiber-reinforced 
plastic rod exhibits a non-uniform 
distribution in the circumferential direction of the rod  
 
in any cross-section of the metal fitting. Therefore, 
it has been considered an indispensable condition for 
the insulators to have a structure wherein the plastic 
rod is
