<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes antagonists for PDGF. The antagonists contain amino acids, and may be monomers or dimers. Especially preferred are dimers which bind the PDGF receptors, but prevent dimerization of the bound receptors. Dimerization is necessary for PDGF effect, hence the antagonistic effect. Also described are nucleic acid sequences for making the antagonists, as well as cell lines transfected with the material. The figure sets forth amino acid sequences for peptides eluted from PDGF-A HPLC experiments.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PLATELET DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR ANTAGONISTS RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial Number 883,949 filed on May 15, 1992. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to antagonists of the molecule known as platelet derived growth factor, or "PDGF". More particularly, it refers to amino acid containing antagonists, both monomers and dimers, for PDGF-BB. Also described are various nucleic acid based materials useful in preparing the antagonists, as well as uses therefor. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTPDGF was first recognized as a component of platelet a granules, which had growth promoting activity for smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (Heldin and Westermark, Cell Regul 1: 555-566 (7-90)). It has also been implicated in the stimulation of connective tissue - derived cells in vitro (Ostman et al. , J. Biol. Chem. 263(31): 16202-16208 (11-88)), as the major itogenic protein for mesenchymal cells (Murray et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,889,919 and 4,845,075), and as an inducer of cell multiplication and DNA synthesis in cultured muscle cells, fibroblasts and glial cells (Kelly et al, PCT Application WO90/14425 (11-29-90)) . It has also been shown to be involved in the wound healing response (Ross et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 295: 369 (1976)), and may be involved in a causative role for the development of proliferative lesions of artherosclerosis (Ross) supra. Others have suggested that this molecule may be a mediator of tumor development as well as in non alignant proliferative disorders (Heldin et al., supra) .The PDGF molecule has been very well characterized. It is known to exist as a heterodimer of an "A" chain and a "B" chain, connected to each other via disulphide bonds. The dimer, sometimes referred to as "PDGF-AB", has a molecular mass of about 30 KDa. Amino acid sequences are known for both the A and B chains, as shown, e.g., by Murray et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,889,919 and 4,845,075, the disclosures of which 

are incorporated by reference. The mature chains contain slightly more than 100 amino acids, and are about 60% homologous. Heldin et al., supra.Dimers PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB have been prpduced via recombinant means, and have also been isolated from natural sources (see Murray et al., supra; Heldin et al., supra) . The various dimers, or "isoforms" differ in functional properties and secretory behavior.The mechanism by which PDGF acts on cells has received intensive scrutiny, and it has been established that there are two receptors for PDGF, the "Î±" apd
