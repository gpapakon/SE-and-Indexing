<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to semiconductor device
manufacturing and in particular to systems for in-situ
measurements of defects such as slip dislocation patterns and warpage
as defined in the precharacterizing portions of claim 1 or claim 7. Stress in thin layers of dielectrics, metals, and
other thin material layers deposited on a semiconductor
wafer is an important parameter in semiconductor device
fabrication. Thin film stress can result in warpage of
the wafer which can affect device performance,
reliability, and line-width control during various
microlithographic patterning steps. In extreme cases,
the warpage resulting from thin film stress can present
problems in securing and handling the wafer during device
processing.Additionally, various high temperature (e.g. above
850Â° C) processes such as rapid thermal processing (RTP),
epitaxial growth, thermal oxidation, thermal annealing,
and some low-pressure chemical-vapor deposition (LPCVD)
processes can result in the formation of slip dislocation
lines on the wafer surface and mostly at the wafer edge.
The slip dislocations are the result of crystal
dislocations in the semiconductor substrate due to
temperature non-uniformities causing thermally induced
mechanical stresses. Such slip dislocations can reduce
device fabrication yield and interfere with
microlithography process steps. It is important to have
in-situ measurement capability to characterize and
quantify stress and slips in order to optimize
process/equipment parameters.Available systems for evaluating thin film stress
usually employ a laser beam to measure the wafer warpage
(radius of curvature) in order to extract thin film
stress values. These systems, however, usually rely on
large optical components requiring the systems to be
separate from the semiconductor processing equipment.
These systems, therefore, cannot be used for in-situ
sensing and measurement applications such as those 
desired for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and
process/equipment control and diagnostics. These stress
measurement systems are also rather expensive and have
been designed exclusively as ex-situ stand-alone
measurement and inspection tools. Moreover, the
available stress measurement tools only provide an
average film stress value for the entire wafer surface
and do not provide information on stress distribution.X-ray topography has been the primary semiconductor
characterization technique used for slip dislocation
mapping. X-ray topography, however, is an ex-situ
material evaluation
