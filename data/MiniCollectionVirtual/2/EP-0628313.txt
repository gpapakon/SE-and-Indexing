<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical 
composition for angiotensin II-mediated diseases, which 

comprises a compound having angiotensin II antagonistic 
activity of the formula 


wherein R¹ is H or an optionally substituted 
hydrocarbon residue; R² is an optionally esterified 

carboxyl group; R³ is a group capable of forming an 
anion or a group convertible thereinto; X is a covalent 

bond between the 2 phenyl rings or a spacer having a 
chain length of 1 to 2 atoms as the linear moiety 

between the adjoining phenylene group and phenyl group; 
n is 1 or 2; the ring A is a benzene ring having 1 or 2 

optional substituents in addition to R²; and Y is a 
bond, -O-, -S(O)m- (wherein m is 0, 1 or 2) or -N(R⁴)-(wherein 

R⁴ is H or an optionally substituted alkyl 
group), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof 

in combination with a compound having diuretic activity 
or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical
composition
for the treatment of hypertension which
comprises a compound having angiotensin II antagonistic
activity or a salt thereof in combination with
a compound having
calcium antagonistic activity, and to a method of its
use.While calcium antagonists have been used as therapeutic
agents of circulatory diseases such as hypertension,
cardiac diseases, cerebral apoplexy, nephritis and
arteriosclerosis, it has also been known that they tend
to cause such undesirable side effects as tachycardia,
hypotension, erythroprosopalgia and encephalagia, which
are considered to be due to their abrupt vasodilative
action.On the other hand, it is disclosed in EP-0425921,
EP-0459136 and EP-0520423 that benzimidazole
derivatives have angiotensin II antagonistic
activities and are useful for the therapy of
circulatory diseases including hypertension, cardiac
diseases (cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction,
etc.), cerebral apoplexy, nephritis and
arteriosclerosis. The mechanism of the action is
considered that the benzimidazole derivatives inhibit
the binding of angiotensin II having a strong
vasoconstrictive action to an angiotensin II acceptor. In EP-A-0 400 835 and JPA H5(1993)-132467,
it is disclosed that an imidazole derivative
having angiotensin II antagonistic action is
administered together with a diuretic agent or a
calcium antagonistic agent.The invention is intended, by combination of a
compound having angiotensin II antagonistic action or a
salt thereof with
a compound having calcium antagonistic activity, to
perform especially remarkable effects, to reduce
undesirable side effects and to cover up defects
observed in administration of a medicine consisting of
a single component.Circumstances being such as above, the present
inventors have made extensive and intensive studies on
the effects of co-use of a benzimidazole derivative
having angiotensin antagonistic activity with
a compound having
calcium antagonistic activity, and, as a result, they
have found that the co-use performs especially
remarkable effects which were not observed in the
administration of the respective compounds singly, thus
accomplishing the present invention.More specifically, the present invention relates
to
(1) the use of a combination of (±)-1-(cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy)ethyl
2-ethoxy-1-[[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl]-1H-benzimidazole-7-carboxylate
