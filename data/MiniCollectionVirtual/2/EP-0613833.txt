<ABSTRACT>
An outlet stopper comprises a cap part (2) made of a resin and having 
a cylinder (22) which has a screw thread (24) on a side face, an outlet 

part (1) made 
of a resin and having a disk flange (11) which has a bottom face coated 

with 
an adhesive (15) and a hole (14) at the center and a cylinder (12) which 

is placed on 
top of the disk flange and has a screw thread (13) on the side face which 

fits 
the screw thread on the cylinder in the cap part, an opening blade (23) 

fixed 
to the inside of the cap part, and a stopping ring (3) which has a 

protrusion (31) 
projected outward, has a break (32) for opening the ring and stops 

insertion 
of the cap part and the outlet part into each other before reaching the 

fully inserted position. The outlet stopper can be easily attached to a 
package commercially available in a pouch form. By attaching the outlet 

stopper, packages of soft plastic bags can be handled in the same manner 
as packages having an outlet stopper, such as hard bottles. Thus, the 

major drawback of packages of a pouch form can be eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel outlet stopper which can be 
attached to a package made of a plastic bag used for containing 
commercial products. Commercial products which have heretofore been sold in bottles of 
glass or hard plastics, such as milk, soy sauce, oil, cosmetics and other 
like products of a fluid or slurry form, are recently sold in packages of 
paper cartons, bottles of thin plastic sheets and bags of plastic films 
(pouches). Outlet stoppers are attached to paper cartons and thin plastic 
bottles. A necessary amount of the content is taken out each time from 
the package through the outlet stopper and the remaining amount is 
kept in the package by closing the outlet stopper. However, no outlet stopper is attached to plastic film bags of a 
pouch form. A pouch is opened by a consumer by tearing the film at a 
small cut made at an upper part of the pouch or by cutting an upper part 
of the pouch with scissors and the content is poured out from the package for 
use. When not all the content in the pouch is used but some amount is 
left unused in the pouch, the opening has to be closed with a clip or the 
like. This causes inconvenience for the consumer. To get rid of such inconvenience, pouches attached with an outlet  
 
stopper are sometimes used. However, this practice has drawbacks that 
a process of attaching a hard outlet stopper to a soft bag causes difficulty, 
that an outlet stopper attached to a bag causes problems in the process of 
packaging of commercial products by an automatic packaging machine 
and that an outlet stopper causes problems in transportation and 
packing of bags because of its shape projected from the bag. An outlet stopper for a packaging bag of pouch form 
recently became known (JP-A-1990-127254 and 
JP-U-1990-108872). 
This outlet stopper has a structure comprising a cylinder 
having a flange and can be attached to the surface of a pouch at the 
bottom of the flange with a pressure-sensitive adhesive by a consumer 
who has purchased the pouch. Part of the film of the pouch exposed to 
the inner part of the flange is then cut to open the pouch. The cylinder is 
closed with a cap into which an opening blade for cutting open the pouch can be inserted. The difficulty during production of a pouch, the difficulty 
during automatic packaging and the inconvenience on packing 
of bags can be eliminated by using an outlet stopper which can be 
attached to a bag by a consumer. However, this type of outlet stopper has 
the drawback that additional work, such as

Outlet stopper for pouch-like packaging bags, comprising a cap part 
(2) made of resin and having a cylinder (22) which is closed with a 

roof (21) at the top and a screw thread (24) on the inner side face, 
an outlet part (1) made of a resin and having a disk flange (11) 

which is coated with an adhesive (15) on the bottom face and has a 
hole (14) at the center and having a cylinder (12) which is placed 

on top of the disk flange (11) and has on the outer side face a 
screw thread (13) which fits the screw thread (24) on the inner side 

face of the cylinder (22) in the cap part (2), an opening blade (23) 
which is fixed downward at the center of the inner face of the roof 

(21) of the cylinder (22) in the cap part (2) and has blade tips 
(27) projecting belo
w the bottom face of the disk flange when the 
cap part is fully screwed into the outlet part,
characterized in that,
 
a removable stopping 

ring (3) wound round the outer face of the cylinder (12) of the 
outlet part (1) is positioned between the lower end of the cap part 

(2) and the top face of the disk flange (11) of the outlet part, 
keeping the blade tips (27) at a position not reaching the bottom 

face of the disk flange (11) of the outlet part (1) to stop 
insertion of the opening blade (23) of the cap part (2) through the 

outlet part (1) before reaching the fully inserted position of the 
cap part (2), the stopping ring (3) having a protrusion (31) 

projecting outward and a break (32) to open the ring (3).
