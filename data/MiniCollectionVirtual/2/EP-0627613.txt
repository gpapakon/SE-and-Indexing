<ABSTRACT>
A method of magneto-optically modulating light comprises 
the steps of linearly polarizing the light on its transmission path 

(TP), placing a magnetooptic effect element (120) on the transmission 
path (TP) of the polarized light with the spontaneous magnetization 

direction (M₁, M₂) of the element being parallel with the 
transmission path (TP), the polarized light being modulated into a 

first light component when the plane of polarization of the polarized 
light is rotated to assume the first rotational position (P₁) 

by the magnetooptic effect element (120) in the absence of the applied 
magnetic field (Ha), applying the magnetic field (Ha) to the 

magnetooptic effect element (120) with the internal magnetization of 
the element (120) being oriented in a direction (M₃) perpendicular 

to the transmission path (TP), the polarized light being modulated 
into a second light component when the plane of polarization of the 

polarized light is shifted to a second rotational position (P₂) by 
the magnetooptic effect element (120) in the presence of the applied 

magnetic field (Ha). According to the method, the light is modulated 
under the condition that the transmission path (TP) is perpendicular
 
to the applied magnetic field (Ha), thereby making it possible 

to direct the transmission path (TP) in one of a variety of different 
directions respectively perpendicular to the direction of the 

applied magnetic field (Ha).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optically
modulating system, and more particularly to a method of and apparatus
for magneto-optically modulating light by utilizing a magnetooptic
effect element which is capable of rotating the plane of polarization
of the polarized light while the polarized light passes through the
magnetooptic effect element.There has so far been proposed a wide variety of optical
modulating systems which can be adopted, for example, to position
sensing apparatus such as linear scales or linear/rotary encoders.
A typical prior art position sensing apparatus utilizing the optical
modulation comprises a light source element for emitting light beam,
a light receiving element placed in opposite relationship to the light
source element so as to receive the light beam from the light source
element, and an encoder plate formed with a plurality of slits and
disposed between the light source element and the light receiving
element. The encoder plate is adapted to be movable in a direction
perpendicular to the propagation direction of the light beam emitted
from the light source element with respect to the light source element
and the light receiving element. The encoder plate is moved
with respect the light source element and the light receiving element
alternately to allow the light beam emitted from the light source
element to be received by the light receiving element through the
slits of the encoder plate and to prevent the light beam emitted from
the light source from being received by the light receiving element,
thereby producing the optical signal based on the movement of the
encoder plate with respect to the light source element and the light 
receiving element.The prior-art position sensing apparatus thus
constructed, however, has a drawback in that the light
beam is apt to be interruptted between the light source
element and the light receiving element, since the
light beam is propagated in the air between the light
source and the light receiving element and accordingly
interrupted by dew and dust in the air, particularly
under a coarse environment.To avoid such a drawback, there have been proposed
improved position sensing apparatuses disclosed in US
Patent No 4947035 and US Patent No 5042905.US Patent No 4947035 discloses an optical transducer
comprising a Faraday rotor material, a first permanent
magnet adjacent to the Faraday rotor material, a second
permanent magnet located in the vicinity of the first
permanent magnet and the Faraday rotor material.US Patent No
