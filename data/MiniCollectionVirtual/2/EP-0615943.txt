<ABSTRACT>
Of the two bobbins (1, 2) arranged next to one another, only one is being wound at any given time. When this is full, a thread guide (5) has to transfer the thread to the adjacent empty bobbin. So that the thread wound on the full bobbin does not become unwound, it is held by a pressure device (10), such as a brush (10), against the directly adjacent bobbin flanges (8, 9) until the loop between the bobbins is severed by a cutting device (7).

<CLAIMS>
Two-spool arrangement for the continuous winding 
of threads or the like onto two spools, which are 

axially in alignment with each other, are disposed 
adjacent each other and rotate in an axially driven 

manner, only one spool at a time being wound, said 
arrangement having a changing device, which is 

displaceable parallel to the spool axes for the forward 
and backward guidance of the thread during the winding 

process in a direction parallel to the spool axis, and 
having an auxiliary winding device associated with the 

spools, said auxiliary winding device gripping the 
thread during the changeover from the full spool to the 

empty spool and retaining the thread on the spools at 
least until it is severed by means of a cutting device 

disposed on the machine, characterised in that the 
auxiliary winding device is configured as a pressing 

device such as a brush (10) or a roller, which extends 
over only the width of the immediately adjacent spool 

flanges (8, 9) and only abuts against the peripheral 
faces of the spool flanges which protrude radially 

outwardly. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the pressing device is disposed on the two-spool 

arrangement so as to be displaceable forwardly and 
backwardly (11).
