<ABSTRACT>
A spray device for liquids in printing machines, having a piston pump (2) for supplying liquid, in a metered quantity depending in each case on the suction stroke path of the piston, to a nozzle device (8) by means of which the liquid is sprayed onto a part of the printing machine. Means (54) for delaying closure are provided for an outlet valve (22) and means (16) for delaying opening are provided for an inlet valve (14) of the piston pump (2).

Part of a printing press, which has a liquid sprayer with the following 
features: a piston pump (2) for the supply of a dosed liquid quantity, dependent 

on the piston suction stroke path, such as e.g. water, detergent, solvent, 
wetting agent or a mixture thereof or printing process liquid to a nozzle 

device (8), with which the liquid is sprayed onto a printing press part such 
as e.g. a rubber blanket cylinder, printing plate cylinder, impression cylinder, 

inking attachment roller, water ductor roller or a washing cloth for 
washing such cylinders or rollers or the print carrier; a pump inlet valve 

(14) in a suction line (12), which flow-connects a liquid container (4) to a 
suction inlet (10) of the piston pump (2); a pump outlet valve (22) in a 

pressure line (20), which flow-connects a pressure outlet (18) of the piston 
pump (2) to the nozzle device (8); in which during a suction stroke of the 

pump piston (38) the inlet valve (14) is open and the outlet valve (22) 
closed and during the compression stroke the inlet valve (14) is closed and 

the outlet valve (22) open, characterized in that closure delay means (54) 
are provided through which the outlet valve (22) is kept in the open position 

at the start of the suction stroke of the pump piston (38) during a predetermined 
suction stroke initial path (56) and only then does it completely 

close and opening delay means (16) are provided, through which the inlet valve 
(14) at the start of the suction stroke and approximately to the end of the 

predetermined suction stroke initial path (56) is kept in the closed position 
and is only completely opened when the pump piston (38) is moved in the suction 

stroke direction (46) beyond the end of the suction stroke initial path 
(56) and that the opening delay means (16) are spring means (16), whose valve 

closing force is higher than the suction force produced by the pump piston 
(38) during the initial suction stroke path (56) with the pump outlet valve 

(22) open, but lower than the suction force produced by the pump piston (38) 
during a suction stroke movement extending beyond the initial suction stroke 

path (56) and with the pump outlet valve (22) closed. 
Liquid sprayer according to claim 1, characterized in that the closure 
delay means (54) are mechanical forced control means between the pump piston 

(38) and the outlet valve (22).  
 
Liquid sprayer according to claim 2, characterized in that the forced control 
means is constituted by a tappet (54) operated by the pump piston (38) 

and acting on the outlet valve (22). 
Liquid sprayer according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the outlet valve (22) is a check valve opening in the flow direction away 

from the piston pump (2). 
Liquid sprayer according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that spring means (16) can be set to a given valve closing force. 
Liquid sprayer according to claim 5, characterized in that the spring 
means (16) of the inlet valve (14) are set to a closing force corresponding to 

a pressure between 0.3 and 1 bar, and preferably approximately 0.6 bar. 
Liquid sprayer according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the pump inlet valve (14) is a spring-loaded check valve opening in the 

flow direction towards the piston pump (2). 
Liquid sprayer according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that upstream of the pressure outlet (18) is provided a valve seat (36) at an 

upstream point in the compression stroke direction and which is closed by the 
pump piston (38) at the end of the compression stroke. 
Liquid sprayer according to claim 8, characterized in that the valve seat 
(36) connected upstream of the pressure outlet (18) is in the form of an 

annular rib and that part of the pump piston (38) acting as a valve disk forms 
a disk valve with the valve seat (36). 
Liquid sprayer according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the suction stroke of the pump piston (38) is adjustable (44). 
Liquid sprayer according to one of the preceding claims, characterized by 
a control device (44), which ensures that when the pump piston (38) reaches 

its compression stroke end, it immediately performs in the opposite direction 
a suction stroke movement at least over said suction stroke initial path (56).  

 
Liquid sprayer according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the pump inlet valve (14) and pump outlet valve (22) are integrated into 

the piston pump (2).
