<ABSTRACT>
During the evaporation of a sample substance consisting of large molecules, in particular for mass spectroscopy investigations, the energy supplied for the evaporation can bring about a thermolytic decomposition of the sample substance. According to the invention, in order to prevent such a decomposition, the sample substance is mixed, before irradiation, with a matrix material which consists of a compound which readily decomposes into gaseous molecules on exposure to the laser beam. This material may be one which absorbs the radiation, readily decomposes thermolytically or, alternatively, is transparent to the laser radiation but is mixed with a metal powder. If the mixture is exposed to laser beam pulses, the unstable matrix material first decomposes and thereby releases the embedded molecules of the sample substance. In particular, in combination with a cooling gas jet, a destruction of the molecules of the sample substance can be avoided almost completely in this way. Suitable compounds for the matrix are, in particular, sugar, cellulose and NH4NO3, and polyethylene with gold or silver dust added.

Method for the evaporation of a sample substance 
comprising large molecules with which the sample 

substance is subjected to high energy laser beam pulses 
to desorb molecules located on the surface of the 

sample substance with the energy of the laser beam 
pulse,
 
characterized in that
 
the sample substance is mixed prior to irradiation with 

a matrix material which easily decomposes under the 
influence of the laser beam pulse and which contains at 

least one compound absorbing light at the wavelength of 
the laser beam pulse and the mixture comprising the 

sample substance and the matrix material is exposed to 
the laser beam pulses, whereby neutral molecules are 

desorbed and mixed with a carrier gas jet and, at a 
later point in time, an ionization of the sample 

molecule necessary for mass spectroscopy 
investigation is carried out within the carrier gas jet. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
matrix material is utilized which comprises at least 

one compound which easily decays thermolytically into 
gas molecules. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
a mixture is utilized in which the number of matrix 

material molecules is larger than the number of sample 
substance molecules.  

 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
fraction of sample substance in the mixture assumes a 

value of 10 to 40 % per weight. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a sugar, in particular, a pentose 

or hexose, is utilized as a compound forming the matrix 
material. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 through 4, 
characterized in that a polysaccharide, in particular 

cellulose, is utilized as a compound forming the matrix 
material. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 through 4,

polyethylene is utilized as a compound forming the 

matrix material. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that pellets are formed from the 

matrix material, the sample substance and possibly the 
metal dust and subjected to laser beam pulses.  

 
Method according to the claims 8 through 10, 
characterized in that the pellets are produced from 

spectroscopic polyethylene transparent to radiation in 
the wavelength region of 10 µm having a fraction of 

approximately 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁵ by weight of the sample 
substance and approximately 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁵ by weight of 

gold or silver dust which are subjected to CO₂-laser 
radiation.
