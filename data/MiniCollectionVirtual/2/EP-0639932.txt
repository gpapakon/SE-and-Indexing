<ABSTRACT>
The hearing aid has a support hook (2) incorporating a sound channel (3) attached to the hearing aid housing (1) via a tubular projection (4) of the latter coupled within the housing to an acoustic transducer (6) via a sound line (5). The projection has a multi-sided end piece fitting into an opening provided in the end face of the support hook with a front section having a similar oval or circular cross-section to the remainder of the projection. The projection has at least one seal cooperating with the attached support hook.

Hearing aid to be worn behind the ear, having
a carrier hook (2) which has a sound channel (3) and

can be placed in a detachable manner against a tubular
connection piece (4) which is fastened in the hearing-aid

housing (1) and protrudes from the housing, with
the connection piece in the housing being connected to

a sound transducer (6) by means of a sound line (5),

   characterised

in that for-torsion-proof connection to the
carrier hook (2), the connection piece (4) has an end

piece (7) in the shape of a polygon,
in that connected to the end piece (7), on the
side of the connection piece that faces the housing, is

a cylindrical or oval connection-piece section (8),
in that this connection-piece section (8), in
connection with the free carrier-hook connection end

(12), forms at least one locking and sealing means,
in that in the end section of its sound channel
(3), the carrier hook (2) has a recess (11) as

receiving means for the polygon (7) of the connection
piece (4), and
in that in the direction of the free carrier-hook
connection end (12), this recess (11) turns into a

cylindrical or oval opening section (13) for receiving
the corresponding connection-piece section (8).
Hearing aid according to claim 1,

characterised in that the connection-piece section (8)
has at least one circumferential bead (9) as locking

and sealing means, and in that provided in the carrier-hook
opening section (13) is at least one corresponding

circumferential groove (10).
Hearing aid according to claim 1,

characterised in that the connection-piece section (8)
has at least one circumferential groove as locking and

sealing means, and in that provided in the carrier-hook 
opening section (13) is at least one corresponding

circumferential bead.
Hearing aid according to claim 1,

characterised in that the end piece (7) of the
connection piece (4) has a rectangular, square or

triangular cross-section or is constructed as a hexagon
or octagon.
Hearing aid according to claim 4,

characterised in that the recess (11) in the carrier-hook
end section forms a torsion-proof receiver for the

insertable end piece (7) of the connection piece (4).
Hearing aid according to claim 2,

characterised in that between its polygon (7) and the
bead (9) of the cylindrical or oval connection-piece

section (8), the connection piece (4) forms a limit
stop (14) which is supported against the transition

(15) of the recess (11) of the carrier hook (2) to the
cylindrical or oval opening section (13) thereof, with

the bead (9) and the groove (10) being able to
interlock.
Hearing aid according to claim 1,

characterised in that the end piece (7) of the
connection piece (4) has a bevelled end (16).
Hearing aid according to claim 6,

characterised in that the carrier hook (2) and the
connection piece (4) consist of plastics, and in that

on the basis of the elasticity of the material, the
bead (9) of the one portion (8) can engage in the

groove (10) of the counter piece (13), with there being
formed simultaneously as a result of the bead resting

in the groove and as a result of the limit stop (14)
resting against the transition (15) and also as a

result of the polygon (7) being inserted into the
recess (11), a torsion-proof interlocking and sealing

between the tubular connection piece (4) and the sound
channel (3) of the carrier hook (2).
