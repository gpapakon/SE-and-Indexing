<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an insulation support for busbars having a foot part and a support arm for the busbar itself. In this case, the foot part and the support arm form a retaining holder for the retaining region of the busbar. The busbar is covered by busbar protection boxes which are at a defined distance from one another. The busbar protection boxes are fixed by spacers which are arranged on the busbar itself. The defined distance between two adjacent busbar protection boxes is covered by a collar-like covering element. In this case, the lengths of the individual busbar protection boxes (3, 4, 5) are matched to the distance between adjacent insulation supports (1, 2). A stop limit (12, 22) is integrally formed for this purpose on at least one of the outsides (11, 21) of the insulation support (1, 2) which are directed towards the free ends (31, 32) of the adjacent busbar protection boxes (3, 4 and 3, 5). This stop limit (12, 22) projects into the gap, which is covered by the collar-like covering element (6, 7), between two adjacent busbar protection boxes (3, 4 and 3, 5).

Insulation support for live rails with one base plate and one bracket for the live rail, whereby 
the base plate with the bracket constitutes a retaining assembly for the retention area of the 

live rails, whereby the live rail is covered by live-rail protective casings (3,4,5) which are a 
defined distance from one another, which are fixed over the live rail which they are covering 

by the distance spacers which are arranged over the live rail, whereby the defined distance 
between the 
two neighbouring live-rail protective casings (3,4,5) is covered by a coupling 
type cover element (6,7) whereby on at least one of the external faces (11,21) of the 

insulation support (1,2) directed to the free ends (31,32) of the live-rail protective casings 
(3) a stop limiter (12,22) is formed, which rises into the gap covered by the coupling type 

cover element (6 and 7) between the two neighbouring live-rail protective casings (3,4) and 
(3,5), whereby the given distances between the free ends (31,32) of one of the live-rail 

protective casings (3) and the two assigned stop limiters (12,22) are chosen in such a way 
that the coupling type cover element (6,7) covers all axial covering areas of the live-rail 

protective casings (3).
