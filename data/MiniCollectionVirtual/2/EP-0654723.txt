<ABSTRACT>
A coupling (1) for quick attachment of a thermostatic body (20) to 
a valve (3) at a heating or cooling element (2) shows a connecting 

part (18) with a first connecting end (19) for attachment at the 
thermostatic body (20) and with a second connecting end (23) for 

grasping around a connector (8) of said valve (3). Furthermore, 
there are means (31; 34) for securing the assembled position of the 

connecting part (18) at said connector (8), which means (31; 34) 
comprise eccentrical surfaces (31; 35), which are provided to become 

efficient when turning the coupling parts (18; 34) in relation 
to each other. Said other connecting end (23) of the connecting 

part (18) is designed as a claw shaped sleeve part with four claw 
parts, which are separate by axial gaps (25), and which at both 

axial ends are terminated by radial parts (22; 24) for co-operation 
with the connector (8) without play. The claw parts form together 

on the inside (27) a circular cylindrical surface and on the outside 
in the same circumferential direction eccentrically displaced 

outer surfaces (31) for cooperation with an outer locking ring (34) 
with a contour following design on the inside (35). The locking 

ring (34) is provided to be pressed radially inwardly by turning in 
relation to the claw parts in the one direction to achieve frictional 

locking of the other connecting end (23) of the connecting 
part (18) on the connector (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a coupling, particularly for connecting 
a thermostatic body to a valve at a heating or cooling element, 
which coupling is more closely defined in the initial part of 
claim 1. Areas of use of such couplings are primarily quick connection of 
thermostatic bodies to radiator bound valves and connection of 
hosing and piping without the aid of tools. By GB-A-2 251 487, there is previously known a coupling for connecting 
a thermostatic body to a valve. This coupling is very complicated 
and space demanding with two clamping devices opposing each 
other, the one leg of which is guided in an eccentric groove for 
each leg. By turning the coupling parts in relation to each other, 
said clamping devices are moved roughly in radial direction outwardly 
and release finally an axial space for spring biased 
snapping in of a locking ring. Because of the great number of 
parts, which have to be produced separately, and their time and 
cost consuming assemblage as well as liability to breakdowns, such 
a coupling is disadvantageous. Neither does it seem to offer any 
substantial protection against disassembling or manipulating by 
unauthorized persons. The objective of the present invention is to develop a quick coupling 
of the afore-mentioned kind with a considerable simplification 
and reduction of the number of coupling parts, at the same time as 
the coupling should offer great retaining safety and protection 
against unauthorized manipulations. The coupling shall have a practically 
unlimited lifetime and shall in spite of the aforementioned 
safety and protection be simple and fast to assemble and disassemble, 
respectively, by authorized personnel. It shall be able to 
offer the coupling at a very advantageous price and it shall further 
techniques in this area in various further respects. These objectives are achieved according to the present invention in 
that a coupling of the initially defined kind substantially is designed 
as stated in the characterizing clause of claim 1.  Further characteristics of and advantages with the invention are 
revealed by the following specification with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, which represent some non-limiting embodiments 
of the invention.
