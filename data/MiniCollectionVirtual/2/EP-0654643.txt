<ABSTRACT>
In order to regenerate the adsorbent which is used for purifying compressed air with regard to water and carbon dioxide, use is made of the residual gas of the air distillation apparatus (10), heated to a substantially constant moderated regeneration temperature, in particular between the temperature of the air entering the mass of adsorbent and a temperature which is at most approximately 50 DEG C higher, preferably approximately 10 to 20 DEG C higher, than this temperature of the entering air. This gas is then fed to a tower (16) for cooling the water for cooling the compressed air.

Process for the distillation of air, of the type in
which air is compressed (in 1); the compressed air is

cooled (in 5) by heat exchange with cooling water
previously cooled (in 16) by heat exchange with waste gas

from the air distillation apparatus (10); the compressed
and cooled air is purified of water and carbon dioxide (in

6), by adsorption in a mass of adsorbent; the mass of
adsorbent is regenerated (in 7) by means of waste gas from

the air distillation apparatus; and at least a part, and
preferably all, of the gas which has carried out this

regeneration is used to cool (in 16) the cooling water of
the compressed air, and the adsorbent is regenerated by

means of waste gas brought to a substantially constant,
moderate regeneration temperature, characterized in that

the regeneration temperature is inclusive between the
temperature of the air leaving the mass of adsorbent and a

temperature which is higher by approx. 50 °C maximum,
preferably approx. 10 to 20 °C, than the temperature of the

air entering the mass of adsorbent and in that the gas
which has carried out the regeneration is never cooled

before it is used to cool the cooling water of the
compressed air.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
adsorbent is regenerated in a single step by means of waste

gas at a substantially constant temperature, the adsorbent
being returned to adsorption phase immediately after this

single step.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the waste regeneration gas is brought to the said

moderate temperature by heat transfer (in 14) starting from
the compressed air which has not yet undergone the said

cooling. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
said heat transfer is conducted in indirect manner (in 14),

by means of a transfer fluid taking heat (in 3) from the
compressed air which has not yet undergone the said

cooling.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the waste regeneration gas is brought to the said

moderate temperature by heat exchange (in 27) with a
fraction of the compressed air which has also undergone a

boosting (in 26).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the remainder of the waste gas from

the distillation apparatus is also used to cool (in 16) the
cooling water of the compressed air.
Air distillation installation, of the type comprising:
an air distillation apparatus (10); a main air compressor

(1); a first heat exchanger (5) which places the
compressed air in heat exchange relationship with cooling

water; a water cooling tower (16) which places the cooling
water, upstream of the said heat exchanger, with waste gas

purifying air of water and carbon dioxide which comprises

at least two adsorption bottles (6, 7) and means for
putting these bottles alternately in adsorption phase and

regeneration phase of the adsorbent; means (11) for
supplying the bottle (6) in regeneration phase with waste

gas from the distillation apparatus; and means (13; 27)
