<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a cathodic 
electrocoating composition and in particular to a cathodic 
electrocoating composition containing zinc hydroxyphosphite 
pigment as a corrosion inhibitive pigment and a 
supplementary catalyst. The coating of electrically conductive substrates by 
an electrodeposition process (also called an electrocoating 
process) is a well known and important industrial 
process. Electrodeposition of primers to automotive 
substrates is widely used in the automotive industry. In 
this process, a conductive article, such as an autobody or 
an auto part, is immersed in a bath of a coating 
composition containing an aqueous emulsion of film forming 
polymer and acts as an electrode in the electrodeposition 
process. An electric current is passed between the 
article and a counter-electrode in electrical contact with 
the aqueous emulsion until a desired coating is deposited 
on the article. in a cathodic electrocoating process, the 
article to be coated is the cathode and the counter-electrode 
is the anode. Resin compositions used in the bath of a typical 
cathodic electrodeposition process also are well known in 
the art. These resins typically are made from a 
polyepoxide which has been chain extended and then an 
adduct is formed to include amine groups in the resin. 
Amine groups typically are introduced through reaction of 
the resin with an amine compound. These resins are 
blended with a crosslinking agent and then neutralized 
with an acid to form a water emulsion which is usually 
referred to as a principal emulsion. The principal emulsion is combined with a pigment 
paste, coalescent solvents, water and other additives to 
form the electrocoating bath. The electrocoating bath is 
placed in an insulated tank containing the anode. The 
article to be coated is the cathode and is passed through  
 
the tank containing the electrodeposition bath. The 
thickness of the coating that is deposited on the article 
being electrocoated is a function of the bath 
characteristics, the electrical operating characteristics, 
the immersion time and the like. The resulting coated article is removed from the bath 
after a set period of time and rinsed with deionized 
water. The coating on the article is cured typically in 
an oven at a sufficient temperature to produce a 
crosslinked finish on the article. Cathodic electrocoating compositions and resin 
compositions, coating baths, and cathodic electro-deposition 
processes are disclosed in Jerabek et al US
