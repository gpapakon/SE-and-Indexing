<DESCRIPTION>
Weeds cost farmers billions of dollars annually in crop losses and in the expense of
keeping weeds under control. Much of the cost of intertillage of row crops, maintenance of
fallow, seedbed preparation, and seed cleaning is chargeable to weed control. Suppression of
weeds along highways and railroad right-of-ways, and in irrigation ditches, navigation channels,
yards, parks, grounds, and home gardens also is expensive. Ragweed pollen is the source of
annual periodic distress to several million hayfever sufferers. Poison ivy, poison oak, poison
sumac, nettles, thistles, sandburs, and puncturevine also bring pain to millions. Weeds also serve
as hosts for other crop diseases as well as for insect pests.The losses caused by weeds in agricultural production environments include decrease in
crop yield, reduced crop quality, increased irrigation costs, increased harvesting costs, decreased
land value, injury to livestock, and crop damage from insects and diseases harbored by the weeds.Chemical herbicides have provided an effective method of weed control; however, the
public has become concerned about the amount of residual chemicals which might be found in
food, ground water, and the environment. Stringent new restrictions on the use of herbicides and
the elimination of some effective herbicides from the market place could limit economical and
effective options for controlling costly weeds. Additionally, the visually apparent phytotoxic effects
of some systemic herbicides appear very slowly on the target weeds, so pesticide users often seek
methods by which the apparent speed of action of the herbicide is increasedRecently, salts of fatty acids, primarily sodium or potassium fatty acid salts, have been
used commercially as pesticides. Compositions having excellent pesticidal properties which exploit
these salts are available commercially from Safer, Inc., under the trademark SAFER
INSECTICIDAL SOAP. A herbicidally active composition utilizing partially saponified fatty acids
as the active ingredient is sold by Safer, Inc. under the trademark SHARPSHOOTER. These fatty
acid compositions are effective, naturally occurring pesticides which have no known long term
environmental effects. Although fatty acid salts have herbicidal activity, it would be desirable to
provide a alternative composition having a unsaponified active ingredient while maintaining the
environmental compatibility of the pesticide and reducing the eye and skin irritancy of the
product.U.S. Patent Nos. 2,626,862; 4,975,110; and 5,035,741

5
-
11
 hydrocarbon group
optionally including an epoxide and/or cyclopropane ring,

and optionally substituted by one or two OH groups; and
R
2
 is a saturated or unsaturated C
1-13
 divalent
hydrocarbon group.
A method according to claim 1, wherein R
1
