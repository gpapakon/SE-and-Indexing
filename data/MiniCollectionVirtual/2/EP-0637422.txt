<ABSTRACT>
A freestanding modular furniture arrangement is 
provided to create workstations in open office plans, 

and other similar applications. Each furniture unit 
includes a worksurface (5) with cutouts (6) having caps 

(77) in the rear corners to mount overhead cabinets 
(7), privacy screens (8), and other furniture 

accessories. A mounting rail (12) extends continuously 
along the rearward edge of each work-surface, and is 

capable of removably supporting therein a plurality of 
different amenities, such as bookshelves, CRT stands, 

fans, task lamps, etc., so as to permit a worker to 
personalize his or her own workstation. A removable 

stanchion (171) permits certain convertible amenities 
to be supported either freestanding on the worksurface, 

or along the rear of the worksurface on the mounting 
rail. An L-shaped intermediate leg (14) is available 

to support the worksurface in a cantilevered fashion to 
facilitate unfettered task chair movement along the 

forward edge of the worksurface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to furnishings for
offices and the like, and in particular to freestanding
modular furniture arrangements for open office plans,
and other similar applications.Open office plans are well known in the art, and
generally comprise large, open floor spaces that are
partitioned off into individual workstations by movable
panels. Such partition panels often include an
electrical raceway along the bottom of the panel to
provide electrical power to the various workstations.
Two examples of such open office plans are described in
US-A-4235495 and US-A-4135755.Partition panels in such open office plans are
typically configured to receive hang-on furniture
units, such as worksurfaces, overhead cabinets,
shelves, etc., so that the panels become an integral
part of the workstation furnishings. One example of
such a partition panel arrangement is described in
US-A-3916972.The above-noted partition panels and hang-on
furniture arrangements are usually known in the office
furniture industry as "systems furniture. Such
systems furniture arrangements have some inherent
restrictions in versatility, since each workstation
must necessarily include certain types of partition
panels in order to support the hang-on furniture units.
Furthermore, the hang-on furniture units can generally
be assembled only in a rather limited number of
different arrangements.The present invention overcomes these
disadvantages by providing a unique alternative 
arrangement.The invention is set out in the accompanying claims.Thus the invention provides a modular furniture arrangement having an
amenity mounting rail system. The modular furniture unit preferably comprises
the additional features set out below including at least one worksurface panel,
having supports connected at opposite ends thereof to form a modular,
freestanding furniture unit. A plurality of different 
amenity units are provided, each of which has a lower
end adapted for mounting the same on the furniture
unit, and an upper end adapted to equip the furniture
unit. A mounting rail is connected with and supported
by the furniture unit, and extends generally
continuously along the rearward edge of the worksurface
panel. The mounting rail includes a plurality of
substantially identical apertures spaced generally
regularly along the length of the mounting rail. The
apertures are shaped to closely receive therein the
lower ends of any one of the amenity units to securely
yet removably mount the same therein, whereby one or
more of the amenity units can be
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A modular furniture arrangement, comprising a
worksurface panel (5), a back panel (35) disposed

forwardly of the rearward edge of the worksurface
panel, at least two supports (14,28) connected with the

worksurface panel and the back panel to form a modular,
freestanding furniture unit supported by the supports

on a floor surface (3), characterised by a plurality of
different amenity units (13), each having a lower end

thereof with first mounting means (170) for mounting
the same on said furniture unit, and an upper end

thereof with means for equipping said furniture unit, a
mounting rail (12) connected with and supported by the

furniture unit, and extending generally continuously
along the rearward edge of the worksurface panel, the

mounting rail including a plurality of substantially
identical second mounting means (148) spaced generally

regularly along the length of the mounting rail, and
positioned fore-to-aft between the back panel (35) and

the rearward edge of the worksurface panel (5); the
second mounting means selectively mating with the first

mounting means on the lower ends of any one of said
amenity units to securely yet removably mount the same

therein, whereby one or more of the amenity units can
be arranged and detachably mounted in the mounting rail

substantially anywhere along the rearward edge of said
worksurface panel, wherein the back panel (35) and the rearward edge of said

worksurface panel (5) define an access channel (141) therebetween through
which the lower ends of said 

amenity units pass during mounting of the same in said
mounting rail.
An arrangement according to claim 1 which includes
a wireway (90) adapted to receive and retain wiring

therein, the wireway being connected with the furniture
unit and communicating with an associated portion of

said access channel, whereby power cords associated
with the amenity units can be inserted through the

associated portion of the access channel into the
wireway and routed therethrough to a source of

electrical power.
An arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2
which includes a flexible cover (153) positioned over

the associated portion of said access channel to
selectively close the same; the cover being locally

deformable to permit wiring to be inserted into, and
withdrawn from said access channel.
An arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 3
in which the second mounting means comprise a first set

of preferably obround mounting apertures (148) disposed
adjacent an upper portion of the mounting rail and a

second set of preferably circular mounting apertures
(149) disposed adjacent a lower portion of the mounting

rail and arranged generally vertically in line with the
first set of mounting apertures, the first mounting

means comprising preferably circular prongs (170) each
of which is received within a generally vertically

aligned pair of said mounting apertures to securely
support the associated amenity unit. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 in which said second mounting
means comprise a plurality of substantially identical apertures spaced generally

regularly along the length of said mounting rail; said apertures being shaped to
closely receive therein the first mounting means on the lower ends of any one of

said amenity units to securely yet removably mount the same therein, whereby
one or more of said amenity units can be arranged and detachably mounted in

said mounting rail substantially anywhere along the rearward edge of said
worksurface panel to personalize said furniture unit.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 in which said worksurface panel
(5) has a forward edge, a rearward edge, opposite side edges, and forward and

rearward corners; the arrangement further comprising at least one privacy
screen (8) having first fastener means (134) positioned adjacent opposite sides

thereof for mounting said screen on said furniture unit; first and second
mounting apertures (6) disposed through said worksurface panel adjacent the

rearward corners of said worksurface panel; second fastener means (71)
connected with said furniture unit, and positioned underlying said first and

second mounting apertures, and releaseably engaging said first fastener means
to detachably mount said privacy screen on said furniture unit in a generally

vertical orientation adjacent the rearward edge of said worksurface panel; at
least two caps (78), each being shaped to close at least a portion of an

associated one or said mounting apertures; and means for detachably supporting
each of said caps on said worksurface panel over an associated one of said

mounting apertures, whereby to mount said privacy screen on said furniture

unit, said caps are removed from said worksurface panel, said first and second
fastener means are detachably interconnected, and said caps are reattached to

said worksurface panel. 
An arrangement according to claim 6 wherein the first fastener means is
spring biased to facilitate vertical adjustment of the privacy screen.
