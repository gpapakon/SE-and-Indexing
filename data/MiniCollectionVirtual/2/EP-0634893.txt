<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for developing plants of novel type being capable of nitrogen-fixation also in their leaves. The process of the invention comprises inoculating plant protoplasts, cells, tissues, embryos or organs grown and/or treated under in vitro conditions with bacteria belonging to the family of Azotobacteraceae, then cocultivating the thus-obtained culture at a temperature of 15 to 35  DEG C and, if desired, propagating and/or regenerating the whole plant under in vitro conditions on or in a culture medium containing nitrogen and main carbon source(s) utilizable only by the plant cells as well as optionally other additives. The process of the invention ensures a well-balanced growth of the plant together with the bacteria.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for developing
novel type of plants which are capable of fixing nitrogen
also in their leaves.It is known that nitrogen is the main limiting
factor of agricultural plant cultivation since the supply
of nitrogen by fertilization is albeit efficient but very
expensive and is accompanied by an extreme environmental
pollution. The worldwide spreading conception of cultivation,
the conception of "sustainable development" gives
preference to the production based on internal resources
instead of using external ones. Accordingly, it is suitable
to provide the nitrogen supply of plants by utilizing
the possibilities implied in the biological nitrogen-fixation
instead of employing fertilizers [Plant and Soil
141, 1-12 (1992)]. However, only some procaryotes (diazotrophs)
are able to fix the atmospheric nitrogen gas.The so-called aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the
members of genera Azomonas, Azotobacter, Beijerinckia and
Derxia belonging to the family of Azotobacteraceae
[Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacterology, 8th ed.,
Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, page 253 (1974)], which
are capable of an efficient nitrogen-fixation even at atmospheric
oxygen levels, are unable in the nature to be
incorporated into the inner tissue spaces of plants
[Azotobacteraceae: the Taxonomy and Ecology of the
Aerobic Nitrogen-fixing Bacteria, Academic Press, New York
(1979)] and to spread in the intercellular spaces
although it could be proven that, when settling down on
the roots or on the outer surfaces of leaves, these species
are capable to provide the nitrogen demand of some
plants to a significant or whole extent [J. Gen. Microbiol.
71, 103-116 (1972); J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 25, 
261-271 (1979); Can. J. Bot. 69, 2296-2298 (1991)]. The
so-called microaerophilic diazotrophs, fixing the
nitrogen at low oxygen levels, are only able to form
intercellular endosymbioses [Nitrogen-fixing Bacteria in
Nonleguminous Crop Plants, Sci. Tech. Publishers/Springer-Verlag,
Madison, WI, pp. 84-88 (1987)] which, however,
can fix nitrogen gas only in the roots, i.e. far
from the site of photosynthesis.From US-A-3,704,546 there has been known a process for
synthetic, aseptic, symbiotic fixation of gaseous nitrogen
consisting essentially in the steps of
a. providing a liquid nutrient culture medium consisting
essentially of live undifferentiated plant
cells from the family Leguminosae;b. aseptically inoculating the undifferentiated plant
cells in the liquid culture medium with live symbiotic
microorganisms

<CLAIMS>
A process for developing plants of novel type
being capable of nitrogen-fixation in their leaves,

which 
comprises
 inoculating plant protoplasts,
cells, tissues, embryos or organs grown and/or treated

under 
in
vitro
 conditions with bacteria belonging to the
family of Azotobacteraceae, then cocultivating the thus-obtained

culture at a temperature of 15 to 35 Â°C and,
propagating and/or regenerating the whole plant

under 
in
vitro
 conditions on or in a culture medium
containing nitrogen in optimum amount and main carbon source(s)

utilizable only by the plant cells,
which are less favourable carbon nutriment supply than the

practically used optimum carbon nutriment supply, as well as
optionally other additives.
A process as claimed in claim 1, which 
comprises

using the species of the genera Azotobacter,
Azomonas, Beijerinckia or Derxia belonging to the

family of Azotobacteraceae.
A process as claimed in claim 2, which 
comprises

using for inoculation the vegetative cells,
cysts or forms partially or totally deprived of their

cell wall of bacteria.
A process as claimed in claim 1, which 
comprises

using lactose, maltose, galactose, cellobiosa,
starch, raffinose and/or sorbitol as main carbon

source(s) being utilizable only by the plant cells.
A process as claimed in claim 1, which 
comprises

adding the main carbon source(s) in a concentration
of at least 10 g/litre, preferably 20 to 40

g/litre, to the culture medium. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, which 
comprises

adding the main carbon source(s) in a concentration
of 0.35 to 0.75 M to the culture medium for

bacteria partially or totally deprived of their cell
wall.
A process as claimed in claim 1, which 
comprises

maintaining the pH value of the culture
medium between 5.5 and 9.5 for bacteria belonging to the

genera Azotobacter, Azomonas or Derxia and between 3 and

9.5, respectively, for bacteria belonging to the genus
Beijerinckia.
A process as claimed in claim 1, which 
comprises

using 0 to 0.5 g/litre of calcium carbonate
and/or 0 to 0.2 g/litre of calcium chloride as other

additives when Azotobacter or Azomonas genera are
employed.
A process as claimed in claim 1, which 
comprises

using "supplementary" carbon source(s), preferably
sucrose or glucose, furthermore vitamins, amino

acids and growth-promoting agents as other additives.
