<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic device comprising at least two cylinder-piston assemblies (8, 10) which are each of the double-action type with a front chamber (17, 20) and a rear chamber (18, 19) on either side of a piston (16, 21) and wherein the chambers of the cylinder-piston assemblies (8, 10) are connected in series in a hydraulic control circuit such that the front chamber (20) of a first assembly has a direct connection to a rear chamber (18) of a second assembly. At least one of the cylinder-piston assemblies (8, 10) is provided herein with valve means (31, 32) which open a bypass bypassing the piston of the assembly when the piston is situated close to the direct connection at the end of its stroke and the effective piston surfaces are the same in the chambers mutually connected by the direct connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydraulic device as defined 
in the introductory part of claim 1. Such a device is known from FR-A-2 380 218. Because the effective piston surfaces are the same in 
the chambers mutually connected by the direct connection, 
the quantity of oil displaced from the one chamber will 
provide in the other chamber an equal displacement of the 
relevant piston. The valve means bring about a synchronous 
adjustment of the pistons at the end of each stroke. Any 
leakage of oil from the two chambers mutually connected by 
the direct connection would normally result in a non-synchronous 
position of the pistons, although the movements 
continue to proceed at exactly the same speed. Use of the 
said valve means results in the oil that may be lost through 
leakage being supplemented via the bypass at the end of each 
stroke. Due to the non-return valves oil under pressure can 
only be fed in one direction, in the shown embodiment in the 
direction in which the pistion rod extend. The ingoing 
stroke occurs due to external force. The invention has for its object to provide a device of 
the kind set forth above in which the cylinder-piston 
assemblies can be fed with oil under pressure in two 
directions, such that the piston rods can be extended as 
well as retracted by oil under pressure. In a hydraulic device according to the invention this 
object is achieved with the characterizing measures of claim 
1. With the step of claim 2 easily available identical 
cylinder-piston assemblies can be used. The effective piston  
 
surfaces are the same in all chambers of these assemblies so 
that in a random series connection the desired synchronous 
operation is automatically obtained. In applications wherein it is not possible to work with 
cylinder-piston assemblies with a continuous piston rod the 
step of claim 3 can be applied. Also in this case the same 
effective piston surface of the mutually communicating 
chambers is obtained, which ensures the desired synchronous 
operation. With the measure as characterized in claim 4, a simple 
and reliable construction is achieved. A further favourable development is characterized in 
claim 5. In the relevant end position both valve means are 
opened so that hydraulic oil fed from a pressure conduit can 
flow through the chambers connected in series of the 
cylinder-piston assemblies. Venting of the cylinders hereby 
takes place automatically and after a possible disassembly 
the system can in this manner be filled with oil very 
rapidly, wherein any
