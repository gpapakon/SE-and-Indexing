<ABSTRACT>
Rotational (torsional) vibration damper with an outer ring and an inner ring, one surrounding the other, which are connected and supported on one another in a torsionally elastic manner by spokes that can be deflected in the circumferential direction. The spokes are of undeformable design and are connected to the inner ring, on the one hand, and to the outer ring, on the other hand, by interlayers of rubber.

<CLAIMS>
A torsional vibration damper having an outer and 
an inner ring (1, 2) which surround one another and are 

connected in a rotationally elastic manner and supported on 
one another by spokes (3) deflectable in the peripheral 

direction, characterized in that the spokes (3) are of 
undeformable design and are vulcanized by intermediate 

coatings (4) of rubber directly to the inner ring (2) on one 
side and directly to the outer ring (1) on the other side . 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the spokes (3) on the sides facing the 

inner and the outer ring (2, 1) end in convex surfaces (5) 
which extend parallel to the rotation axis (6). 
A torsional vibration damper according to either 
of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the outer ring (1) 

is formed by a belt pulley. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the spokes (3), cut 

along a plane constructed in the rotation axis (6), have a 
profile open axially in a C-shape at least in one direction. 
A torsional vibration damper according to any of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the spokes (3), cut in 

a plane constructed transversely to the rotation axis (6), 
have a dumb-bell profile.
