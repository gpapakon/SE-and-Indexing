<ABSTRACT>
Device for holding a boot on a snowboard, especially, but not exclusively, a snowsurfing board. The device includes a longitudinal shaped support bar (6a, 6b), a support runner (12), and holding means (14) for the end of the boot. The slide (12) is slidingly mounted along the support bar (6a, 6b) which includes a rack (18a, 18b) extending along at least part of its length. The device is characterised by a pushing device (34) with teeth (30, 31), which is guided in a vertical receptacle of the slide (12) and which cooperates with the notches of the rack (18a, 18b) to stop the slide in a predetermined longitudinal position. When the pushing device (22) is in a raised position, it prevents engagement of the boot.

Device for retaining a boot on a gliding board 
comprising a longitudinal support section (5, 55) extending in 

an approximately horizontal plane, a support carriage (12, 13, 
62) with an upper support surface for at least one part of the 

sole of the boot, a retention means (14, 15, 16) to link the 
end of the boot to the support carriage at least along a 

longitudinal direction and a vertical direction, the support 
carriage (12, 13, 62) being slidably mounted along the section 

(5, 55), the section further having at least one rack (18a, 
18b, 19, 61) on at least one portion of its length, the 

carriage (12, 13, 62) being equipped with a thrustor (22, 23, 
72) to cooperate with the rack of the section and to enable 

immobilization of the carriage in various longitudinal 
positions of the section, the thrustor being movable between 

a lowered position where it is located beneath the upper 
support surface of the carriage and a raised position where it 

protrudes partially with respect to this surface,
 
   characterized by the fact that the carriage has, in its 

central portion, a housing that opens on its upper surface, 
that the movable thrustor (22, 23, 72) is slidably mounted in 

the housing, and that it has, in section, dimensions which 
correspond to the dimensions of the housing. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the thrustor (22) has gripping means (33, 34) to be 

able to manually pull it into a raised released position. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by thefact 
that the thrustor (22) has abutments (28, 29, 39, 40) that 

cooperate with the carriage (12) and/or the section (5) to 
limit the vertical upward and downward course of the thrustor.  

 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the toothing (30, 31) of the 

thrustor (22) is mounted on at least one of the lateral faces 
(28, 29) of the thrustor (22), and that the rack (18a, 18b, 

19) extends laterally in two parts on each side of the 
thrustor. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized by the 
fact that the thrustor (22) has a width approximately equal to 

the space between the two parts (18a, 18b, 19) of the rack. 
Device according to claim 5, characterized by the 
fact that the toothing (30, 31) extends in the upper part of 

the lateral faces (28, 29) of the thrustor at a height close 
to the diameter of the arms (6, 6, 7, 7) that constitute the 

section (5) and that under the toothing (30, 31) the thrustor 
has exposed lateral faces at a height close to the diameter of 

the arms (6, 6, 7, 7) of the section (5). 
Device according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized by the fact that the toothing (80) of 

the thrustor (72) is mounted on the lower face of the 
thrustorand that the rack (78) is situated under the thrustor, 

in the median part of the section (55). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the 
fact that the gripping means of the thrustor (22, 23, 62) are 

two edges (33, 34) situated in the upper part of the thrustor, 
whose width is close to the thickness of the wall of the 

carriage at this level.
