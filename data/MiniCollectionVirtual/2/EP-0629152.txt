<DESCRIPTION>
 LAMINATED METAL SHEETFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a process for producing polymer film coated metal sheet and to can ends of polymer film coated metal sheet.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONMetal materials coated with thermoplastic polymer film are well known. The use of such materials for rigid metal packaging has been widely described.Simultaneous lamination of polyester and polyolefin films to metal sheet is disclosed in EP-A-0312302. This specification is primarily concerned with lamination to steel sheet of a composite polyester film on one major surface and a polyolefin containing film on the other major surface. The polymer film coated steel sheet was found to be useful in the production of can ends.Simultaneous lamination of a polyester/metal/polyester laminate is also disclosed in EP-A-0312303 in which a composite coextruded polyester film is adhered to steel sheet. Good corrosion resistance was imparted by the use of an outer polyester layer having a crystallinity greater than 30% as measured by density.EP-A-0312304 describes a polymer film coated metal sheet to which is adhered an amorphous polyester. The polymer film coated metal sheet was found to be particularly useful in the formation of drawn and wall ironed cans made from aluminium 3004 alloy. 

JP 58-25591 describes a process for the production of a metal substrate coated with a thermoplastic polyester resin using low crystallinity starting film material. It was found that a crystallinity range of5 to 50% for the polyester in the laminate was useful because the forming and processing properties of coated metals and the corrosion resistance of the formed, processed products were dramatically increased by maintaining the degree of crystallisation of the resin layer to within the specified limits.GB-A-2123746 discloses a method of producing a metal sheet laminated with, a polyester resin film by coating the metal with a crystalline and oriented polyester resin film. Laminates of" steel or aluminium were produced by a controlled single step, metal heating process, film application and then without reheating, quenching.Techniques for the manufacture of beverage can ends are well established.EP-A-0153115 discloses a method of making a can end. According to this method, a disc is blanked and a shallow drawn cup is formed from the disc. The shallow drawn cup is reformed into a shell by forming a centre panel, allowing the wa'll of the cup to fold and producing a countersink or reinforcing channel. The presence of the
