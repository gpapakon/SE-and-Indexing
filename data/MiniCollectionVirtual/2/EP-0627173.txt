<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a preparation for dietetic use or as a food 
supplement, characterised by comprising a nucleus or an assembly 

of nuclei, each comprising one or more nutritional substances such 
as vitamins, mineral salts, oligoelements, enzymes, amino acids,
 
phospholipids, fatty acids or constituent elements of 

physiological bacterial flora, the nucleus being coated with at 
least one covering layer of a macromolecular substance consisting 

of cellulose or a derivative or analogue thereof, for the 
substantially total release of said nutritional substances into 

the colon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The colon is known to be the seat of the final stage of metabolic-catabolic 
processes, and being an organ very rich in 
microorganisms and responsible for forming the fecal mass must be 
able to operate constantly at optimum level because otherwise it 
could frequently become the seat of heterogeneous and sometimes 
very serious proteiform pathological symptoms, such as functional 
alterations, constipation or diarrhea symptoms, polyposis, 
diverticulosis, local or diffuse ectasia, dysplasia, carcinoma, 
IBD etc. The relationship between colon functionality/intestinal 
transit/physiological fecal mass formation and the problematic 
biochemistry and metabolism which govern the terminal part of the 
digestive tract is very close, to the extent that often the type 
of food determines the appearance or persistence of alterations of 
various kinds. The colon is not only the terminal organ of transit in the 
digestive tract, but is also the main metabolic organ of the body, 
because of the presence of intestinal bacterial flora very rich in 
different kinds of biological activity.  Because it is also a metabolic organ, the colon represents the 
seat of production of an important quota of free radicals and a 
obligatory crossing path for entry into the body of catabolic 
toxic products or the refuse from the metabolism of different 
nutrients. It is known that specific acaloric micronutrients (vitamins, 
oligoelements, enzymes, nucleotides etc.) or certain elementary 
compounds (such as essential amino acids) exercise key roles (of 
essential type) in determined stages of metabolic processes in 
general, and it is also known that many metabolic processes take 
place in the colon. The metabolic processes which take place in the colon (lumen and 
colocolic mucosa) are of various types, but they can be divided 
essentially into two large groups, namely: metabolic processes 
regarding hydroelectrolytic lumen/tissue liquid/blood interchange, 
and the absorption of terminal fractions of the various primary 
metabolisms (glucides, protides, lipids) or the reabsorption of 
substances concerning entero-hepatic circulation (such as 
metabolized bile salts), with significance as detoxication 
processes; and the production of toxic factors and systems for 
their elimination, in which context the production of ammonium 
radicals (highly damaging to cerebral structures) as the terminal 
process in nitrogenated metabolism and the production of 
potentially carcinogenic substances etc. are particularly 
important in relation

phospholipids, fatty acids or constituent elements of 
physiological bacterial flora, the nucleus being coated with at 

least one covering layer of a macromolecular substance consisting 
of cellulose or a derivative or analogue thereof, for the 

substantially total release of said nutritional substances into 
the colon. 
A preparation as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said nutritional substances included in said nucleus are chosen 

from the following: vitamins A, C, E B-group vitamins, 
pantothenic acid, vitamin complexes; mineral salts and 

oligoelements such as zinc, copper, iodine, manganese, selenium, 
chromium; brewers yeast; lactic ferments; amino acids; aspartame; 

butyric acid. 
A preparation as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said macromolecular substance in the covering layer is chosen from
