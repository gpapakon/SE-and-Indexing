<ABSTRACT>
A rotary adsorption/desorption gas treating 
apparatus includes a rotary drum (1) rotatable along a 

rotation axis (P) and having a plurality of gas passage 
compartments (4) arranged in a peripheral direction of the 

drum. The apparatus further includes an adsorbing 
element cassette (8) mounted inside each of the gas 

passage compartments and including a gas-permeable 
adsorbing mat (7). The rotational range of the rotary 

drum is divided between an adsorption zone and a 
desorption zone. In the adsorption zone, a treatment 

subject gas (G) is allowed to pass the gas passage 
compartments in the direction along the rotation axis 

of the rotary drum. In the desorption zone, a 
refreshing gas (H) is allowed to pass the gas passage 

compartments in the direction along the rotation axis 
of the rotary drum. The adsorbing mat, when mounted 

in the compartment, includes a portion thereof 
oriented normal or inclined relative to a side end 

face of the rotary drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary
adsorption/desorption type gas treating apparatus for
eliminating a target substance from treatmemt subject
gas containing the substance by adsorbing the
substance and then desorbing the same. The apparatus
is used, for instance, for separating and eliminating
a paint solvent from atmosphere containing the solvent
exhausted from a painting factory.Figs. 8 and 9 show a known apparatus of the
above-described type. As shown, this apparatus
includes a rotary drum 1' having a plurality of gas-passage
compartments 4' arranged side by side along
the peripheral direction of the drum and defines, in
the peripheral direction, an adsorption zone X' for 
allowing passage of treatment subject gas G through
the compartment(s) 4' in the radial direction of the
drum and a desorption zone Y' for allowing passage of
refreshing gas H through the compartment(s) 4' in the
generally opposite radial direction. At each gas-passage
compartment 4', there is provided a gas-permeable
adsorbing element 7', in the form of a flat
plate element, with an inclination relative to the
radial direction of the drum.In operation, in accordance with rotation of the
rotary drum 1', the respective compartments 4' are
alternately brought into registered relationship with
the adsorption zone X' and the desorption zone Y'. In
the adsorption zone X', as the subject gas is passed
through the adsorbing element 7', the target substance
contained in the gas is adsorbed on the adsorbing
element 7'. Then, in the desorption zone Y', the
substance on the element 7' is desorbed to the
refreshing gas H, such that the element 7' becomes
refreshed to be ready for a next adsorption/desorption
cycle. In this manner, the apparatus can treat the
subject gas G continuously.Further, each gas-passage compartment 4' includes 
a partition wall 3' which serves to separate this
compartment 4' from another compartment adjacent
thereto. In operation, when the compartment 4' is
placed between the adsorption zone X' and the
desorption zone Y', the partition wall 3' serves as an
inter-compartment partition for partitioning between
the adsorption zone X' and the desorption zone Y' in
order to prevent gas leakage therebetween.According to the above-described conventional
construction, the adsorbing element 7' in the form of
a flat plate is disposed with an inclination relative
to the radius of the rotary drum 1', thereby to reduce
the diameter of the drum 1' while maximizing the gas
passage area of the adsorbing element 7'. However,
