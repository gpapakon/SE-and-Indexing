<ABSTRACT>
A package structure, in which a drug-containing 
pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet comprising a support, a drug-containing 

pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, and a separator 
in this order is packaged and sealed in a packaging material, 

is disclosed, wherein unevenness is provided on at least one of 
the surface of the support on the side in contact with the 

inside of the packaging material, the surface of the separator 
on the side in contact with the inside of the packaging 

material, and the inside surface of the packaging material. 
The unevenness reduces the contact area between the packaging 

material and the sheet so that an adhesive, a plasticizer or 
any liquid component of the adhesive layer is prevented from 

adhering to the inside of the packaging material. Therefore, 

the sheet can easily be taken out of unit package on use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package structure
comprising a drug-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet
for percutaneously administering the drug, packaged with a
packaging material.Percutaneous absorption has recently been adopted as a
means for administering a drug into a living body, which
comprises adhering a drug-containing pressure-sensitive
adhesive sheet to a skin of a living body. The drug-containing
pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet generally comprises a support
made of a synthetic resin, such as polyester or polyethylene,
having formed on one side thereof a pressure-sensitive adhesive
layer containing a drug for percutaneous absorption, with the
surface of the adhesive layer being covered with a separator.
Such a drug-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet is
usually packaged with an individual packaging material
impermeable to moisture so as to prevent volatilization of the
drug contained therein and to prevent the influences of
moisture on the drug.In the case of individually packaging the drug-containing
pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet as above, if the
adhesive is squeezed out from the extremities of the sheet, the 
adhesive squeezed out adheres to the inside of the packaging
material, making it difficult to take out the drug-containing
pressure adhesive sheet from the packaged body.Where the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer contains a
plasticizer, a tackifier or a liquid component, there is a
tendency that these substances ooze out from the extremities of
the sheet, go around to the back of the support or separator,
and adhere to the inside of the packaging material, and as a
result, the drug-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet
is adhered to the inside of the packaging material, making it
difficult to take out the sheet from the packaged body at the
use thereof.Further, in packaging the drug-containing pressure-sensitive
adhesive sheet cut into a predetermined size, if the
sheet cut are temporarily piled, a problem occurs that the
slippability between the sheets deteriorates due to the
squeeze-out of the pressure-sensitive adhesive or the go-around
of the plasticizer as same as above, and the workablility of
the packaging is greatly reduced.In order to overcome these problems, it has been
proposed to (1) use an oversized separator or (2) to provide
projections serving as a spacer on the periphery of an
oversized separator as disclosed in JP-B-U-4-51782 (the term
"JP-B-U" as used herein means an "examined published Japanese
utility model application").
