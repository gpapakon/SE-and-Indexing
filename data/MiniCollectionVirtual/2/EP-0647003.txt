<ABSTRACT>
A wiring patch panel cabinet (10) accommodates plural 
termination devices (28). A cabinet support structure 

includes spaced apart top and bottom walls (12,14) and 
opposed sidewalls (16,18). The cabinet support structure 

secures a plurality of individual patch panels (24). Each 
patch panel accommodates termination devices (28) of a given 

type. The termination devices of one patch panel may be 
different from the termination devices of another patch 

panel supported by the cabinet structure. The patch panels 
(24) are supported by the cabinet in side-by-side vertical 

orientation to facilitate removal and repair of an 
individual patch panel without disturbing adjacent patch 

panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a wiring 
cabinet for connecting patch and line cords. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a wiring 
cabinet which supports elongate patch panels in vertically 
oriented side-by-side disposition. When wiring a building so as to permit transmission of 
data between various work stations or between work stations 
and a host system, the wiring between such equipment is 
typically interconnected at a patch panel. Each patch panel 
may include a plurality of termination devices, each 
representing either a work station location or a host 
connection. The patch panel permits interconnection of line 
cords, which are attached to work stations or the host 
system. The patch panels themselves may be interconnected 
by patch cords. The patch cords and line cords may be 
collectively referred to as patch cables. Typically, a plurality of patch panels are supported by 
a patch panel cabinet in a wiring closet where one or more 
of the cabinets are used to connect various components 
together using the patch cables to form physical networks. 
A patch panel would support plural termination devices at a 
front face thereof along a horizontally extending row with 
the associated wiring terminated by the termination device 
extending behind the panel itself. Plural of these panels 
would be stacked above one another in the cabinet to 
facilitate the interconnection between various patch panels. Often, it is necessary to replace one of the patch 
panels in the cabinet so as to upgrade, change or otherwise 
conduct maintenance on the devices contained therein. In 
the normal horizontal orientation of the patch panels, in 
order to access the patch panel to be changed, it may be 
necessary to remove adjacent panels to gain access to the 
patch panel to be changed. Further, when disposing the  
 
elongate patch panels in a horizontal disposition, patch 
cables extending from the front face of the panel have a 
tendency, due to gravity, to "droop" and to become tangled 
with other patch cables extending from the patch panels 
extending above and below the panel. Accessing certain 
patch cables becomes time consuming and costly. This makes 
it difficult for the installer to readily make changes in 
the wiring cabinet. It is desirable to provide an arrangement of patch 
panels in a wiring cabinet which would permit the more 
efficient distribution of such patch cables and the easy 
removal and reinsertion of patch panels in the cabinet. It is an object of the present

<CLAIMS>
A wiring patch panel cabinet for connecting plural 
patch cables to termination devices comprising: 

   a support structure having spaced apart top and bottom 
walls and opposed side walls; and 

   a plurality of elongate patch panels supported by said 
support structure, each said patch panel accommodating said 

termination devices of a given type along a longitudinally 
extending row, the given type of termination devices of one 

said patch panel being of a different termination type from 
said termination devices of another patch panel; 

   said plurality of patch panels being supported by said 
support structure with one end of each said patch panel 

being secured to said top wall, and said other end of each 
said patch panel being supported by said bottom wall, said 

longitudinally extending row of termination devices 
extending in vertical orientation; 

   whereby said patch cables connected to said termination 
devices of one said patch panel do not become intertwined 

with said patch cables terminated to said termination 
devices of an adjacent patch panel. 
A wiring patch panel cabinet of claim 1 wherein 
said patch panels are accommodated by said support structure 

in side-by-side orientation. 
A wiring patch panel cabinet of claim 1 or claim 
2 wherein said patch panel includes a panel face for 

supporting said termination devices. 
A wiring patch panel cabinet of claim 3 wherein at 
least one of said panels includes a panel platform extending 

perpendicularly from said face for supporting wires 
terminated to said termination devices. 
A wiring patch panel cabinet of any one of claims 
1 to 4 wherein each said patch panel is removably secured 

to said cabinet for removal therefrom without disturbing 
the remaining said patch panels in said cabinet. 
A wiring patch panel cabinet of any one of 
claims 1 to 5 further including securement elements for 

removably securing said panel one end to said top wall. 
A wiring cabinet for supporting plural patch 
cables comprising: 

   a cabinet support structure having a top wall and a 
bottom wall, and 

   a plurality of elongate patch panels, each patch panel 
accommodating said patch cables; 

   said plurality of patch panels being supported by said 
support structure with one end of each said patch panel 

being secured to said top wall and said other end being 
supported by said bottom wall, said patch panels extending 

in vertical orientation; 
   whereby said patch cables supported by one said patch 

panel do not become intertwined with said patch cables 
supported by an adjacent said patch panel. 
A wiring cabinet of claim 7 wherein said each 
patch panel includes means for accommodating plural 

termination devices. 
A wiring cabinet of claim 7 wherein one of said 
patch panels of said plurality includes an elongate front
