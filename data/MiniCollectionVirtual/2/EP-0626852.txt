<ABSTRACT>
Transplantation antigen-depleted cells and methods for making such cells from a target cell are provided. The transplantation antigen-depleted cell is made by exposing a target cell to an oligonucleotide capable of binding to a transplantation antigen nucleotide sequence. The oligonucleotide is capable of binding to the nucleotide sequence according to Watson-Crick or triplex binding rules. Preferred transplantation antigens are the MHC class I or II antigens. Oligonucleotides useful in practicing this method are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR MAKING UNIVERSAL DONOR CELLSTechnical FieldThis invention is related to therapeutics, transplantation and immunology. More specifically, it relates to a method for making cells that are more easily transplanted into a recipient host using oligonucleotides that interact with genes and gene products relating to transplantation antigens expressed on the cell surface of transplanted cells.Background Art Anti-gene code molecules are short RNA or DNA transcripts that are "antisense" (i.e., complementary to a DNA or RNA strand in a Watson-Crick pairing manner) to a portion of the normal RNA and are not translated. Regulation of expression of genes by anti-gene code RNA, one of the natural modes of gene regulation, was first recognized in prokaryotes. Green, P.M. et al., Ann. Rev. Bioche (1986) 5_5:569. Natural anti-gene codes and artificial anti-gene codes have been used in prokaryotes to downregulate prokaryotic proteins. Simmons, R.w. et al., Cell (1983) 3.4:683; Mizuno, T. et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1984) 8J.:1966; Okamoto, K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1986) 3:5000; Pestka, S. et al., Proc. 

Natl. Acad. Sci. (1984) 8JL:7525; Coleman, J. et al. , Cell (1984) 37:429; Farnham, P'.-J. et al. , Proc. Nat1. Acad. Sci. (1985) 82.:3978; Kindy, M.S. et al. , Mol. Cell. Biol. (1987) 1:2857. Artificial anti-gene codes have also been synthesized and used to regulate eukaryotic gene expression. Microinjection or transfection of thymidine kinase (TK) anti-gene codes has been shown to inhibit expression of the TK protein. Izant, J.G. et al., Cell (1984) 3_6:1007; Kim, S.K. et al., Cell (1985) 42:129. Additionally, short anti-gene codes to the 5 r untranslated region of the thymidine kinase gene successfully downregulates protein expression. Izant, J.G. et al. , Science (1985) 229:345. Other examples of the regulation of εukaryotic gene expression by anti-gene codes are the pp66 c-src gene (by transfected full length anti-gene codes) , and the c-fos gene (by an anti-gene code spanning the 5' untranslated region of the first exon) . Amini, S. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. (1986) j5:2305; Holt, J.T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1986) 83.:4794. These anti-gene codes have been introduced under constitutive or heterologous inducible promoters.Synthetic oligomers have also been used to downregulate the expression of c-myc in promyelocytic leukemia cells, and T-lymphocytes. Wickstrom, E.L. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1988) 8_5:1028; Heikkila, R. et al.. Nature (1987) 328:445. C-myc anti-gene code
