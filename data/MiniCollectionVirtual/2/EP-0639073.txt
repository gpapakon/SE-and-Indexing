<DESCRIPTION>
"BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE UREIDO DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS ANTI- METASTATIC AGENTS"The present invention relates to the use of ureido derivatives of substituted pyrroles as antimetastatic agents.As known, malignancy of cancer is mainly due to metastasis. Because therapy usually fails to destroy multiple secondary tumors, their uncontrolled growth leads to death of patients. Only very few patients die from complications directly arising from the primary tumor. Accordingly, there is a need in therapy of drugs able to prevent and/or block the metastatic spread. WO 91/10649 provides ureido derivatives of poly-4-amino- 2-carboxy-l-methyl compounds which have angiogenesis inhibitor activity and have TNF-α neutralizing activity. Accordingly, these prior art compounds can be useful in treating several pathological conditions in mammals where the growth of new blood vessels is detrimental and in which TNF-α is known to play a detrimental role.Now we have found that a selected class of compounds previously disclosed in the above mentioned international application are able to prevent and/or block the metastatic spread of tumors in mammals, including humans.Accordingly, the present invention provides the use of 

a compound of formula ( I )wherein each of m and n, being the same, is an integer of 1 to 3; and each of the R groups, which are the same, is a naphthyl group substituted by 1 to 3 sulfonic groups, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for use in preventing and/or treating the metastatic spread of tumors. The present invention also provides a compound of formula (I), as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in preventing and/or treating the metastatic spread of tumors. The substituted naphthyl group is preferably a 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-naphthyl group, typically a 7- or 8-naphthyl group. When the naphthyl group is substituted by three sulfonic acid groups, the sulfonic acid substituents are preferably in the 1-, 3- and 5- or 1-, 3- and 6- positions. When it is substituted by 2 acid groups, the sulfonic acid substituents are preferably in the 1- and 

 3-, 1- and 5-, 3- and 5- or 3- and 6-positionε. When it is substituted by one acid group the sulfonic acid substituent is preferably in the 1-, 3- or 5-position. The invention also includes within its scope all the possible isomers, stereoisomers and their mixtures and the metabolites and the metabolic precursors or bioprecursors of the compounds of formula (I). As already said, the invention
