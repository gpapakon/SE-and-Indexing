<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides processes for producing a polyolefin at pressures substantially below conventional high pressure conditions in two-phase conditions below the cloud point. The invention may involve a continuous system with optional recycle. It can be used to produce ethylene copolymers at below 500 bars.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to processes for polymerising olefinic 
feeds using metallocene based catalyst systems under pressure. 
The olefinic feeds may contain ethylene, propylene, higher 
olefins and polyenes such as butadiene as well as vinyl 
compounds and copolymerisable aromatic compounds such as styrene 
and copolymerisable other cyclo-olefins such as norbornene. The 
term metallocene refers to compounds containing a coordination 
bond between a transition metal and at least one (generally one 
or two) cyclopentadiene ring structures. The term 
cyclopentadiene ring structure includes polycyclic structures 
such as indenyl or fluorenyl which incorporate a five-membered 
ring. DE-A-2608933 (BASF) discloses a low pressure (e.g. 9 bar), 
metallocene catalysed polymerisation step for ethylene. The 
temperature may be varied to control molecular weight. Lower 
temperatures provide higher productivity and higher molecular 
weights. There is no suggestion of pressure as a major 
influence on the polymerisation process. EP-A-69593 (Mitsui) performs a special form of solution 
polymerisation with phase-separation using non-metallocene 
Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems. Significant amounts of solvent 
are present. A solution is formed having an upper cloud point 
for the polymer/monomer mixture in the reaction medium, such as 
an inert hydrocarbon, which is liquid under the prevailing 
conditions. Polymerisation is carried out above a so-called 
upper cloud point. EP-A-109530 (EC Erdölchemie) discloses a low to medium pressure 
(up to 400 bar) gas phase polymerisation conducted above the 
melting point of the polymer with ethylene feed gas and molten 
polymer flowing in opposite directions. Particulate catalyst 
systems are used including metallocene-type  
 
transition metal components and alumoxane co-catalyst 
components. There is no agitation by mechanical means or 
turbulence of the molten polymer and a settling step is not 
necessary to coalesce the discontinuous polymer-rich phase. EP-A-260999 (Exxon) discloses a high pressure ethylene 
polymerisation process at temperatures over 120°C and at 
least 500 bar using a bis cyclopentadienyl-transition metal 
compound and alumoxane as a catalyst system. Zirconocenes 
are used in the Examples. The Al/Zr ratio varies widely in 
the Examples (See Table 4). Example 18 uses 200°C and 500 
bar for homopolymerisation of ethylene. The experiments are 
performed in 100 ml steel autoclaves in a batch procedure. 
The productivity of the catalyst system cannot be estimated
