<ABSTRACT>
A polypeptide which specifically binds to the helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper domain of either the Myc gene product or the Max gene product so as to prevent Myc:Max heterodimerisation under physiological conditions. The polypeptides have diagnostic and therapeutic applications in relation to tumours associated with overexpression of the Myc gene product. Candidate therapeutic agents may be screened by a process which comprises contacting cells with the candidate therapeutic agents or, when the candidate therapeutic agent is a peptide, optionally expressing the peptide in the cells, which cells contain a reporter gene the expression of which is enhanced or reduced by agents which interfere with Myc:Max heterodimerisation, and observing the level of expression of the reporter gene by the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Leucine ZippersThe present invention relates to peptides which inhibit the binding of proteins via helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper domains (HLH-Z) to related products, to processes for their production and their use in medicine.Overexpression of the myc gene product has been associated with a variety of tumours including pro-myelocytic leukaemia, colon carcinomas, large and small cell lung carcinoma and breast carcinoma. The Myc gene product is known to be involved in driving the cell cycle but the mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated. The Myc gene product is also known to contain a HLH-Z motif and to have the ability to bind to DNA. The sequence specific binding of the Myc gene product to DNA was first noted by Blackwell, T.K. et a_l. in 1990 (Science, 2_5_0, 1149-1151) who postulated that this binding might be responsible for some of the biological functions of the Myc gene product.Leucine zippers and helix-loop-helix domains are two classes of peptide sequences each of which permit hetero- or homodimerisation of polypeptide chains by specific interactions, such as that of GCN4 (a leucine zipper protein) , the crystal structure of which has been described by O'Shea, E.K. et al [Science, 254, 539-544 (1991) ] and Myo D, a helix- loop-helix protein (Tapscott, S.J., Science, 24.2, 405-411 (1988)) . In Myc and Max gene products, adjacent helix-loop- helix and leucine zipper domains form a contiguous structure (HLH-Z) and a short basic region (B) , located just upstream of the HLH-Z domain is involved in DNA binding. 

 More recently it has been found that the Myc gene product can bind, via the HLH-Z domain to the product of the Max gene [Blackwood, E.M. et al., Science, 251. 1211-1217(1991)]. The present inventors have demonstrated that Max:Max homodimerisation is possible whereas Myc:Myc homodimerisation is not possible under physiological conditions.The present inventors have surprisingly established that it is Myc:Max heterodimerisation which leads to the oncogenic effect of Myc and that this interaction can be disrupted by peptides containing an appropriate HLH-Z domain thereby reducing or abolishing the transformation of cells into tumour cells normally associated with overexpression of Myc.The present invention therefore provides polypeptides which specifically bind to the HLH-Z domain of either the Myc gene product or the Max gene product so as to prevent Myc: ax heterodimerisation under physiological conditions.In a particular aspect, the polypeptides of the invention contain a HLH-Z
