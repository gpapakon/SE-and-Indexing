<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a self-assembly bed designed to contain an articulated bed base made up of several sections capable of being moved between a horizontal position and various inclined positions. This self-assembly bed comprises at least two lengthwise members 10 and at least two crosswise members 11, 12; articulated uprights 20; 21, 22; 23, 24 forming the lengthwise edges of the various sections which are to be formed; mechanisms for moving the uprights 21, 22 of the chest section and mechanisms for moving the uprights 23, 24 of the leg section; drive members acting on said mechanisms; and mattress supporting means such as slats. According to the invention, each of the lengthwise members 10 forms, with the corresponding uprights 20; 21, 22; 23, 24 and with the associated mechanisms, a preassembled unit. The self-assembly bed also comprises means for assembling the preassembled units and the crosswise members.
