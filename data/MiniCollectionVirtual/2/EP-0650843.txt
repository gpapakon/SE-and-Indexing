<ABSTRACT>
A multiple-function printing device provides for picking pages 
from a stack of sheets in a sheet feeder (26) for roller-driven 

movement along a first path through a printing station 
(24) to an output (44), and for picking pages from a stack of 

documents in a document feeder (28) for roller-driven movement 
along a second path through a scanning station (22) to the 

output (44), with at least a portion of the first and second 
paths being commonly shared, and with common mechanisms being 

used for various steps such as for picking, providing roller-driven 

movement through the processing stations, and for actuating 
a pressure plate (34) in the input feeders.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to printers and facsimile 
devices, and more particularly to printers and facsimile devices 
which are combined together to form a multiple-function product. Facsimile devices (i.e., fax machines) have been used for many 
years to transmit documents containing text or graphical images 
through a modem via telephone lines through another modem to a 
remote destination. In its basic form, a conventional fax machine 
is used for three separate functions: sending a first document; 
receiving a second document; and producing a hardcopy printout of 
the second document. Of course the hardcopy printout is not the 
actual second document but rather a close facsimile thereof. Thus, 
sending the contents of the second document via fax avoids going to 
the trouble, expense and delay of actually delivering the second 
document to a remote destination. An enhanced fax machine can also be used to perform two 
additional functions: producing a hardcopy printout of the first  
 
document; and producing a hardcopy printout of a cumulative report 
showing an itemized listing of date, time, and destination for 
first documents send from the fax machine. It is therefore apparent that a fax machine acts primarily as 
both a sender (i.e., scanning and transmitting) and receiver of 
documents, and that the fax machine also acts secondarily as a 
printer (i.e., printing a facsimile of a second document, printing 
a copy of a scanned first document, or printing an itemized report) 
and secondarily as a convenience copier (i.e., scanning/printing a 
first document). Both the basic fax machine and the enhanced fax machine just 
described have used two separate paper paths. One path is 
dedicated to the first document and typically includes document 
feeder tray, document paper pick/paper drive system, document 
scanning station, and document output. Another path is dedicated 
to the printout (originally roll-fed, now sheet-fed) and typically 
includes sheet feeder tray, sheet paper pick/sheet drive system, 
sheet printing station, and sheet output. As a result, a fax 
machine is a bulky, expensive multiple-function device which 
retires a large number of parts for duplicate paper handling 
functions. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fax 
machine with common feeder/output mechanisms for documents passing  
 
through a scanning station and for sheets passing through a 
printing station. Another important object is to provide a multiple-function 
printer/fax machine which is

to be processed at a scanning station (22) during a scanning 

operation for particularly scanning a document to be 
sent by facsimile transmission; 
a sheet feeder (26) for holding a stack of sheets to be 
processed at a printing station (24) during a printing 

operation; 
common path means connected to both said document feeder 
(28) and said sheet feeder (26) for receiving individual 

document pages and individual sheet pages; and 
common mechanism means (32, 34, 40, 42) for operatively 
interacting with said common path means to move said individual 

document pages past said scanning station (22) 
to an output (44) and to move said individual sheet pages 

past said printing station (24) to an output (44). 
The multiple-function printer of claim 1 wherein said 
common mechanism means includes a single pick means (32) 

for picking a page from said document feeder (28) during 
said scanning operation as well as for picking a page 

from said sheet feeder (26) during said printing operation.  
 
The multiple-function printer of claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said common mechanism means includes a single pressure 

plate feeder means (34) for holding the stack of documents 
against said single pick means (32) during said 

scanning operation and for holding the stack of sheets 
against said single pick means (32) during said printing 

operation. 
The multiple-function printer of one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein said common mechanism means includes a single 

drive motor (40) for driving said pick means (32) to move 
said individual document pages past said first station 

(22) during said scanning operation as well as to move 
said individual sheet pages past said second station (24) 

during said printing operation. 
The multiple-function printer of claims 3 and 4 wherein 
said single drive motor (40) is connected to said pressure 

plate feeder means (34) in order to change the position 
of said pressure plate feeder means. 
The multiple-function printer of one of the preceding 
claims wherein said common path means includes a common 

output (44) for documents processed at said scanning station 
(22) and for sheets processed at said printing station 

(24) and further includes a path for allowing a document 

during said scanning mode of operation to be actively 
processed at said scanning station (22) and to passively

said sheet feeder (26) and said document feeder (28) each 

include an input slot integrated into the multiple-function 
printer for manual loading of the stack of 

sheets and the stack of documents, respectively, without 
having to remove any input tray; and 


wherein separate pressure plates (62, 66) are provided 
for said document feeder (60) and said sheet fedder (64), 

respectively. 
A method of performing multiple functions in a 
printer, comprising the steps of: 


automatically feeding pages from a first input stack of sheets 
into a first processing path by picking a sheet during a printing 

operation; 
moving the sheet along the first processing path past a 
printing station where text or graphics are created on the sheet to 

form a printout; 
delivering the printout to a first output area; 
placing documents to form a second input stack;  
 
automatically feeding pages from the second input stack of 
documents into a second processing path by picking a document
