<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical recording
materials. The materials are particularly useful in
making recordable compact disks.There are many types of optical recording
materials that are known. In many of the materials,
the mode of operation requires that the unrecorded
material have a high absorption and that the recorded
areas, often referred to as pits, have low optical
density or high reflection. The high reflection pits
are made by ablating away the high absorption recording
material, usually exposing an underlying reflective
support.One of the currently popular forms of optical
storage of information is the compact disk or CD.
Digital information is stored in the form of high
optical density marks or pits on an otherwise
reflective background, the exact opposite of the above
described optical recording materials. In this format,
the optical information is most often in the form of
read only memory or ROM. Optical information is not
usually recorded in real time but rather is produced by
press molding. In a typical process, the optical
recording substrate is first press molded with a master
containing the digital information to be reproduced.
The thus formed information is then overcoated with a
reflective layer and then with an optional protective
layer. In those areas having the deformations or pits,
the optical density is higher than in those areas not
having the deformations. EP-A-0 483 387 discloses a dye composition and an
optical recording medium. The optical recording medium shall
have an improved light fastness and the recording layer
contains cyanine dye and an azo metal chelate compound.It is desirable to produce optical recording media
which, when recorded in real time, produces a record that
mimics the conventional CD on read out. Read out is at 780
nm. In this manner, information can be added 
to the CD and the CD can be used on a conventional CD
player.One recently disclosed system of this type is the
so called "Photo CD". In this system, conventional
photographic film is first processed in a conventional
manner. Then, the images from the film are digitized
and the digital information is recorded in a CD
readable form on an optical recording material. Images
can then be played back on a CD type player into a
conventional television. Since a CD has a capacity for
a number of digitized images that is greater than the
typical roll of consumer film, it is anticipated that
the user will want to add images to a preexisting CD.
Thus the need for recordable, CD compatible optical
