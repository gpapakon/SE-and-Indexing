Process for allotting transmission time slots for 
a transmission system having a plurality of subscriber 

stations which are connected via optical fibres and 
passive couplers to a head end common to all subscriber 

stations, in which 

the data supplied to a subscriber station or output 
by one are transmitted in message cells in the 

course of a virtual connection in accordance with an 
asynchronous transmission method, 
each message cell has a payload section of constant 
length for accommodating the data and a message cell 

header of constant length preceding the payload 
section, 
a message cell rate is specified for each virtual 
connection, characterized in that 
the counter reading of a counter provided on the 
head end side for each virtual connection is 

incremented regularly depending on the specified 
message cell rate, 
a status character is set for a counter whose 
counter reading has exceeded a predetermined counter 

reading, 
the counters are interrogated for the presence of 
set status characters, 
a subscriber station whose associated counter has a 
set status character during the interrogation 

receives a transmit authorization for the largest 
possible number of message cells corresponding to 

the respective counter reading, the counter reading  
 

of said counter being decremented by an amount 
corresponding to said number and the status 

character being reset once the reading falls below 
the predetermined counter reading, and 
a subscriber station that has received a transmit 
authorization transmits a sequence of calibrating 

characters and directly following that a number of 
message cells corresponding to the respective 

transmit authorization to the head end. 
Process according to Claim 1, wherein the largest 
possible number of message cells is limited by a defined 

maximum value. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
counters are interrogated cyclically. 
Process according to Claim 3, wherein no set 
status character was found, starting from the counter for 

whose subscriber station a transmit authorization was 
issued last, given a single cyclical interrogation of all 

other counters, a transmit authorization is issued for an 
additional message cell for said subscriber station 

without the associated counter reading being decremented 
accordingly. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the predetermined counter reading corresponds to 

the time interval between two successive message cells at 
the respective message cell rate. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein a subscriber station-specific delay device is 

calibrated for each subscriber station at regular time 
intervals comprising a multiple of the transmission 

duration of a message cell. 
Process according to Claim 6, wherein the delay 
device is calibrated at regular time intervals of the 

order of one second. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein a subscriber station in which a number of message 

cells filled with data corresponding to the transmit 
authorization is not ready transmits a number of empty  

 
cells calculated from the difference between the number 

according to the transmit authorization and the number of 
message cells filled with data. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the transmission system forwards message cells to 

a switching system that connects through message cells at 
the same transport bit rate in accordance with an 

asynchronous transmission method. 
Process according to Claim 9, wherein the sum of 
the specified message cell rates is less than the maximum 

possible sum of all such message cell rates. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the incrementing and the decrementing of the 

counter readings of the individual counters is effected 
by two mutually independent procedures.
