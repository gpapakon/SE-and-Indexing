<ABSTRACT>
An electronic device operating in the microwave frequency 
range has components disposed in a plurality of planes (44 - 60), 

wherein the planes (44 - 60) are stacked vertically. The 
electronic device is a T/R module or element (62) forming a 

part of a subarray used in an active array radar. The T/R module 
or element (62) comprises a transmit chip, a receive chip, low 

noise amplifiers, a phase shifter, an attenuator, switches, 
DC power supply, interconnects that interconnect the foregoing 

components and logic circuits to control the foregoing components. 
The components when stacked in a 3-D package are disposed 

behind a radiator (44) or antenna, which transmits and receives 
the microwave signals. Behind the T/R module or element (62) 

is a manifold which provides input and output to and from the 
T/R module or element (62). The microwave chips of the T/R module 

are monolithic microwave integrated circuit chips and control 
logic, which are disposed in an aluminum nitride substrate and 

coated with a conformal hermetic coating. The 3-D chip package 
can optionally include microwave channel (58) cooling by adding 

additional layers (48). The integrated circuits also employ 
a flip design for mounting to the wafers. Optional photonic 

interconnects could be used for communication between levels 
in the 3-D package and can be used between subarrays as a 

manifold (Fig. 2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a subarray in an active
array used for transmission and reception of a microwave signal,
comprising an antenna for interfacing said microwave signal,
means for amplifying said microwave signal from said antenna
and means for phase-shifting said microwave signal from said
means for amplifying, wherein said antenna, said means for
amplifying and said means for phase-shifting are disposed on
a plurality of planes stacked in an overlying relationsship.The present invention further relates to a method for
building such a subarray.Such a subarray is known from "Conference Proceedings 22nd
European Microwave Conference 92, Vol. 2, August 1992, Helsinki,
Finland, pp. 888-893, Razban et Rubert "Weather Forecasting
Radar Antenna: An Application of Active Microstrip Antennas"".The present invention generally relates to electronics
packaging technology. More specifically, the present invention
relates to a three-dimensional ("3-D") multi-chip package that
operates in the microwave frequency range.One common application for microwave signals was in the
field of radar. In earlier radars, the antenna was in the form
of a dish, which was mechanically rotated to perform the scanning
function. An exciter generated an RF microwave signal which
was transmitted through a travelling wave tube, where the RF
signal was then amplified to a high level signal and finally 
radiated out through the mechanical antenna. Rotating the antenna
effectively pointed the signal in various directions in the
sweeping mode.The next generation of radars employed phase shifters,
no longer relying on the use of a mechanical antenna that needed
to be physically rotated in order to sweep an area. In this
design, a fixed antenna array was used, and the phase shifter
changed the beam direction by shifting the phase of the RF
energy. Accordingly, the device electronically steered the beam
out of the antenna array.In the next generation of radar, a concept called an active
array transformed the formerly passive fixed antenna into an
active radiating mechanism. In such a radar, a plurality of
transmit and receive modules ("T/R module or element"), each
of which constitutes a subarray, sometimes were arranged on
a stick or similar configuration. Each T/R module or element
was in fact a transmitter and a receiver for the radar all in
one. Usually, the T/R module or element included a transmit
chip, a receiver chip, a low noise amplifier, a phase shifter,
an attenuator, switches, electrical interconnects to connect
