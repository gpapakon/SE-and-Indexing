<ABSTRACT>
An electric motor (10) has a microprocessor (18) with a reset input (24). It furthermore has a device (25, 26) which produces signals (R) while the motor is running, which signals (R) depend on the rotation of the rotor (14). These signals (R) can be supplied to the reset input (24) and result in the microprocessor (18) being cyclically reset to defined initial conditions, controlled by the rotation of the rotor (14).

Electronically commutated electric motor with a
rotor (14; 33), with a microprocessor (18; 40)

serving for control of the electric motor and
comprising a reset input to which a power-on reset

signal can be fed after the motor is switched on,
with a device (35) for production of reset signals

(R) which depend on the rotor position and are
controlled by the rotary position of the rotor (14;

33) and can also be fed to the reset input, and with
a storage element (66) the state of which can be

changed by a reset operation triggered by the power-on
reset signal in order to permit discrimination

between a power-on reset signal and a reset signal
(R) depending on the rotor position by interrogation

of this state and, controlled by the rotation of the
rotor, to reset the microprocessor to defined

starting conditions (fig. 5: A) through the reset
signals (R) depending on the rotor position.
Motor according to claim 1, with which the reset
signal (R) depending on the rotor position is

derived from a rotor position signal (KOMM) of the
motor (30).
Motor according to claim 1 or 2, with which a
differentiating member (26; 56) is provided in order

to differentiate the rotor position signal (KOMM)
and convert it into a reset signal (R) depending on

the rotor position.
Motor according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
with which a power-on reset signal triggers a basic 

initialisation operation (S72) and a reset signal
(R) depending on the rotor position triggers a

different initialisation operation (S84).
Motor according to one or more of claims 1 to 4,
with which the state of the storage element (66) can

be refreshed periodically when the rotor turns, and
in the pause between refreshing operations allows

discrimination between a power-on reset signal and
reset signals (R) depending on the rotor position.
Motor according to one or more of claims 1 to 5,
with which the storage element comprises a capacitor

(66) with which is associated a discharging member,
in particular a discharging resistor (67).
Motor according to claim 6, with which the capacitor
(66) can be charged through the microprocessor (40)

during certain calculation steps (fig. 8: S106 to
S126), and th
is charging is interrupted at least
during the discrimination of reset signals in order

to allow sampling (fig. 6: 69) of the state of
charge of this capacitor (66).
Motor according to one or more of claims 1 to 7,
with which a reset signal (R) depending on the rotor

position causes an interruption in a programme
running at that moment.
Motor according to one or more of claims 1 to 8,
with which a reset signal (R) depending on the rotor

position at least almost coincides with a
commutation point of the motor (fig. 4: 0° el., 360°

el.). 
Motor according to one or more of claims 1 to 9,
with which for production of a power-on reset signal

a capacitor (58) is provided which can be charged
through a charging circuit (48, 59) when the motor

(30) is switched on, and whose charging voltage is
effective as a power-on reset signal at low values.
Process for an electronically commutated motor which
comprises a rotor (14; 33) and a microprocessor (18)

serving for programme-controlled feeding of power to
the motor and having a reset input, for

discrimination between

a power-on reset signal fed to the reset input and
a reset signal (R) depending on the rotor position
which is fed to the reset input and is produced in

at least one predetermined rotary position of the
rotor while in operation,

with the following steps:

a) the state of a storage element (66) associated
with the motor is changed by a power-on reset

signal appearing when the motor is switched on
such that following reset signals can be

recognised as reset signals (R) depending on the
rotor position through this changed state;
b) with each reset signal the state of this storage
element (66) is sampled by the microprocessor

(18) (S70; S102);
c) depending on this state, when a reset signal
appears at the reset input of the microprocessor

(18), a power-on reset signal is distinguished
from a reset signal (R) depending on the rotor

position;
d) different operations (S72, S84; S104, S128) are
carried out in the microprocessor (18) depending 

on the discrimination result.
Process according to claim 11, with which the
changed state of the storage element (66) is

refreshed after each sampling of the storage element
(S73; S106).
Process according to claim 11 or 12, with which the
reset signals (R) depending on the rotor position

are derived from a signal (KOMM) serving for
commutation of the motor.
Process according to claim 13, with which the reset
signals (R) depending on the rotor position are

produced by differentiation of a signal (KOMM)
serving for commutation of the electric motor.
Process according to claim 13 or 14, with which a
new commutation cycle of the electric motor is

initiated after recognition of a reset signal (R)
depending on the rotor position.
Process according to one or more of claims 11 to 15,
with which the programme is divided into modules

(S74, S76) each of which are associated with a
particular range of rotary position of the rotor

(fig. 4),

and with which the rotary position of the rotor (33)
in which a reset signal (R) is emitted coincides

with a range of rotary position in which a module
(S76) runs which can be interrupted by a reset

operation.
Process according to one or more of claims 11 to 16, 
with which the reset signal supplied in a

predetermined rotary position of the rotor (33)
essentially triggers the same action as a

commutating signal (KOMM) which would cause
commutation in the range of this predetermined

rotary position of the rotor during normal programme
operation.
