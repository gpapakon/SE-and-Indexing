<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a nail clamp (1) for fastening cables and other lines on a surface. In the nail clamp (1), there is provided, in a foot part (2) which exhibits a bearing surface (4) on its underside and a planar clamp surface (5) on its upper side, parallel to the bearing surface, a nail-guiding tube which is perpendicular with respect to the bearing surface (4) and has a nail-guiding duct (7) formed therein. The upper opening of the nail-guiding duct (7) is widened in the form of a flat funnel to form a nail seat (8). In the immediate vicinity of the nail seat there is formed on the foot part (2), on the clamp surface (5), a web-like elevation (12) which, when the nail has been driven in to the full extent, absorbs the majority of the drive-in action and distributes it over the entire foot part. By virtue of this damping of the drive-in action, the nail clamp (1) can be fastened on a surface by nailing without the nail clamp being destroyed. A line grip (3) which is formed on the nail clamp (1), and partially encloses a line and exhibits pointed-cone teeth distributed non-uniformly on its inner side (15), serves for the non-slip connection between nail clamp and the line retained by it.

Nail clamp for fixing cables and other lines to a surface, with a base 
part (2) having a bearing surface (4) and, substantially parallel thereto, a 

clamp surface (5), with a nail guide (7) constructed in the base part (2) 
for guiding a nail to be used for fixing the nail clamp (1) to the surface 

and a cable clamp (3) constructed on the base part (2), open in the line 
direction and at least partly open on the side remote from the clamp surface 

(5), characterized by damping means (12) for damping the impact action with 
driven in nail, the damping means (12) being constructed as at least one 

straight damping web (12) running substantially over the entire width of the 
nail clamp (1). 
Nail clamp according to claim 1, characterized in that there is only one 
damping web (12) oriented parallel to the line direction. 
Nail clamp according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the damping 
means (12) are constructed as elevations, which are placed on the clamp 

surface (5) in the vicinity of an upper opening of the nail guide (7) and are 
in particular in one piece with the base part (2). 
Nail clamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the damping means (12) have a height substantially corresponding to the 

height by which a head of a completely driven in nail projects over the clamp 
surface (5). 
Nail clamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the base part (2) is constructed as an inwardly partly hollow part open 

towards the vicinity of the bearing surface (4), bounded by side walls (6, 
10, 21, 22) and substantially closed in the vicinity of the clamp surface 

(5), on which is constructed in one piece the cable clamp with a free end 
(14). 
Nail clamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that on the base part (2) a rear wall (10) facing the cable clamp (3) is 

substantially planar and converges with the at least zonally planar  
 

clamp surface (5), accompanied by the formation of a sharply curved edge (11), 
under an angle only slightly exceeding 90Â°. 
Nail clamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the nail guide (7) is constructed as a nail guidance channel (7) passing 

from the clamp surface (5) to the bearing surface (4) with its longitudinal 
axis substantially perpendicular to the bearing surface (4). 
Nail clamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the cable clamp (3) has line holding means, which are constructed on an 

inside (15) of the cable clamp (3) as inwardly directed, particularly pointed 
cone-shaped teeth (18, 19, 20). 
Nail clamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that on the inside (15) of the cable clamp (3) are constructed at least one 

and preferably two holding webs (16) perpendicular to the line direction 
and preferably the line holding means (18) are located on holding webs (16). 
Nail clamp according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the line holding means (18, 19, 20) are distributed with unequal mutual 

spacings on the inside (15) of the cable clamp (3) and preferably two rows 
of in each case three line holding means are provided, whereof in each row 

one line holding means (19) is substantially perpendicular to the bearing 
surface (4), a second line holding means (20) is inclined towards the base 

part (2) and a third line holding means (18) is directed towards the free 
end (14).
