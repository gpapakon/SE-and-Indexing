<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the clustering of firework bombs, employing for this purpose a device comprising a base plate (1) provided with cells (20) each of which is capable of receiving a free end (10) of a wick (9) and, in the case of one of them, a free end (57) of an igniter cord (58). Between two consecutive cells (20) a channel (33) is arranged, in the base plate (1), capable of receiving a pyrotechnic delay (3) ensuring the transmission of firing between the cells (20). Means forming a lid (2) retain on the base plate (1) the free ends (10, 57) of the wicks (9) and of the igniter cord (58) and the pyrotechnic delays (3). The clustering operation is made easier thereby and its result is made more reliable thereby. Changes in delay on firing ranges are made considerably easier.

Device for grouping fireworks (8) together in
clusters, each of which fireworks has a fuse (9)

comprising a baseplate (1) in the form of a strip
capable, on the one hand, of being fixed along a

battery (4) of mortars (5) each of which is intended to
take a respective firework (8) and, on the other hand,

of being secured to a free end (10) of each fuse (9),
pyrotechnic delays (3) connecting the free ends (10) of

the fuse (9) in pairs and a free end (57) of an igniter
cord (58) for igniting the fireworks (8) via the delays

(3) and the fuses (9),

characterized in that the baseplate (1) has a number of
transverse cavities (20) for housing a respective free

end (10) of a fuse (9), these cavities being spread out
longitudinally to the extent of one cavity (20) per

free end (10) of fuse (9) and opening into one same
longitudinal face (16) of the baseplate (1),

longitudinal channels (33) for housing a respective
pyrotechnic delay (3) connecting the cavities (20) in

pairs and opening into the said face (16), and means
(71, 18) for attaching lid-forming means (2) onto the

said face (16), in that there are also provided
lid-forming means (2) comprising fixing means (70, 74)

capable of collaborating with the said fixing means
(71, 18) belonging to the baseplate (1) so as to allow

the lid-forming means (2) to be fixed to the said face
(16) in a position in which they define, with the

cavities (20) and the channels (33), an assembly which
is closed while still leaving a respective passage for 

the fuses (9) and the igniter cord (58), and in that
the cavities (20) and the channels (33) and/or the

lid-forming means (2) are shaped in such a way that
when the lid (2) is fixed onto the said face (16), it

securely traps a free end (10) of a fuse (9) in each
cavity (20), a pyrotechnic delay (3) in each channel

housing (33) and a free end (57) of an igniter cord
(58) in one of the cavities (20), in a relationship

such that there is pyrotechnic continuity.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cavities (20) are identical.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the channel housings (33) are

identical.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the lid-forming means (2)

comprise one lid (2) per cavity (20).
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the lids (2) are all identical.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the fixing means (71, 18, 70, 74)

are reversible.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the fixing means (71, 18, 70, 74)

comprise clip-fastening means (71, 18, 70, 74).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the channel housings (33) and/or

the lid-forming means (2) comprise mutually opposed
transverse shoulders (40, 50) for the longitudinal

abutment of the pyrotechnic delays (3).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the cavities (20) and/or the

lid-forming means (2) comprise means (26, 69) forming a
chicane for retaining the respective free end (10) of

fuse (9).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the channel housings (33) are

placed in one same longitudinal alignment (37). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the said face (16) and/or the

lid-forming means (2) have transverse deflecting
reliefs (72) between the cavities (20) outside the
