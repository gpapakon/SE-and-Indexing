<ABSTRACT>
A means is provided to eliminate ink trajectory 
errors when an inkjet printhead (14) is fabricated as 

described below. In a preferred embodiment, a nozzle 
member (104) containing an array of orifices (17) is 

affixed to a barrier layer (30) formed on a substrate 
(28/120), the substrate having heater elements (96/98) 

formed thereon. The nozzle member is affixed to the 
barrier layer using heat and pressure. Each orifice in 

the nozzle member is associated with a single heating 
element formed on the substrate. The back surface of the 

nozzle member extends beyond the outer edges of the 
substrate. During the heating and pressure step used to 

affix the nozzle member to the barrier layer, the nozzle 
member undesirable bends over the outer edges of the 

barrier layer, causing the nozzles to be tilted outward. 
In one embodiment to prevent this bending from skewing the 

nozzles, the nozzles are initially formed at a slight 
inward angle to compensate for the subsequent bending of 

the nozzle member. In another embodiment, the barrier 
layer is formed with one or more trenches (144) parallel 

to the long edges of the barrier layer to cause the nozzle 
member to dip and bend over the trenches. The nozzles are 

located at the crest of the nozzle member and, thus, 
remain normal to the surface of the printhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to inkjet and
other types of printers and, more particularly, to a means
to eliminate ink trajectory errors when the ink is
expelled from an inkjet printhead.Thermal inkjet print cartridges operate by rapidly
heating a small volume of ink to cause the ink to vaporize
and be ejected through one of a plurality of orifices so
as to print a dot of ink on a recording medium, such as a
sheet of paper. Typically, the orifices are arranged in
one or more linear arrays in a nozzle member. The
properly sequenced ejection of ink from each orifice
causes characters or other images to be printed upon the
paper as the printhead is moved relative to the paper.
The paper is typically shifted each time the printhead has
moved across the paper. The thermal inkjet printer is
fast and quiet, as only the ink strikes the paper. These
printers produce high quality printing and can be made
both compact and affordable.In one prior art design, the inkjet printhead
generally includes: (1) ink channels to supply ink from an
ink reservoir to each vaporization chamber proximate to an
orifice; (2) a metal orifice plate or nozzle member in
which the orifices are formed in the required pattern; and 
(3) a silicon substrate containing a series of thin film
resistors, one resistor per vaporization chamber.To print a single dot of ink, an electrical current
from an external power supply is passed through a selected
thin film resistor. The resistor is then heated, in turn
superheating a thin layer of the adjacent ink within a
vaporisation chamber, causing explosive vaporization, and,
consequently, causing a droplet of ink to be ejected
through an associated orifice onto the paper.One prior art print cartridge is disclosed in U.S.

Inkjet Head", issued February 19, 1985 and assigned to the
present assignee.Canadian Patent Application No. CA-2084344A, in the
name of Hewlett-Packard Company, discloses a method of
bonding printhead conductive leads to electrodes on
substrate-aligning orifices and heating elements which
inherently aligns electrodes with exposed ends of
conductive traces.In one type of prior art inkjet printhead, disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,683,481 to Johnson, entitled "Thermal
Ink Jet Common-Slotted Ink Feed Printhead", ink is fed
from an ink reservoir to the various vaporization chambers
through an elongated hole formed in the substrate. The
ink then flows to a manifold area, formed in a barrier
layer between the substrate and a

A method of forming an inkjet printhead
comprising the steps of:


forming a nozzle member (104) having a plurality
of nozzles (17) with a first tilt angle; and
affixing a substrate (28/120) containing a
plurality of ink ejection elements (96/98) to a back

surface of said nozzle member using heat and

more outer edges of said substrate, wherein said step
of affixing causes said nozzles to be tilted with
