<ABSTRACT>
A process is specified for manufacturing a device for the transmission of signals between two terminals, of which at least one is movable in relation to the other and between which there is arranged a line running in turns, forming a wound body and accommodated in a substantially circular cartridge, to which line the continuing lines on the two terminals are connected. The cartridge comprises two parts, a stator and a rotor, which is rotatable about the axis of the cartridge and about the stator. The two parts of the cartridge are captively interconnected by injection moulding in such a way that the rotor is rotatable in the stator about a common axis.

Method for manufacturing a device for the 
transmission of signals between two terminals, at least 

one of which terminals can be moved in relation to the 
other and between which terminals a line which runs in 

turns, forms a winding body and is accommodated in an 
essentially circular cassette is arranged and to which 

terminals lines which lead on are connected at the two 
terminals, in which the cassette comprises two 

components, a stator and a rotor which can be rotated 
about its axis and about the stator, characterized in 

that both components of the cassette (K) are connected to 
one another in a captive manner by means of injection-moulding 

such that one component can be rotated in the 
other about a common axis. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that both components of the cassette (K) are manufactured 

by means of injection-moulding as an annular disc (RI) 
with a cylindrical tubular element (RO) which protrudes 

on one side and whose clear width is equal to the clear 
width of the central opening of the annular disc (RI) and 

whose axial height corresponds approximately to the 
height of the cassette (K). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 

in that initially the first component (12) of the 
cassette (K) is manufactured with at least one 

peripheral projection (14) on the inner surface of 
its tubular element (RO2), 
in that subsequently the second component (11) of 
the cassette (K) is injection-moulded around the  

 
first component (12) in such a way that its tubular 

element (RO1) lies inside the tubular element (RO2) 
of the first component (12) separated from it by a 

narrow air gap and engages around the projection 

(14) of said first component with a peripheral 
depression (15) and 
in that finally the winding body of the line (10) is 
inserted into the annular space (13) between the two 

components (11, 12) of the cassette (K). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that both components (11, 12) of the 

cassette (K) are manufactured in pivotable moulds of the 
same injection-moulding device in one work cycle. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that different materials are used for 

the two components (11, 12) of the cassette (K). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that for the component of the cassette 

(K) which is injection-moulded as the second component 
(11) a material is used which has a lower melting point 

than the material used for the first component (12).
