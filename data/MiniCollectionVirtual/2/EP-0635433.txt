<ABSTRACT>
A bag, in particular made of plastic, has a press strip closure which consists of a female closure part and a male closure part, whose backs are connected (18, 17), preferably welded, to opposite walls (16, 19; 15) of the bag. In order that such a bag can be opened and closed easily and nevertheless counteracts an opening force exerted by a pressure of the contents located in the bag with great resistance, the connection (18) between the back of the female closure part and the bag wall (16, 19) begins at a point outside the centre of the female closure part and extends from there to the bag opening.

<CLAIMS>
Bag, in particular made of plastic, having a
press-strip closure which comprises a female closure part

(2) and a male closure part (1), of which the spines (4,
3) are connected (18, 17), preferably welded, to opposite

walls (16, 19; 15) of the bag, the connection (18)
between the spine (4) of the female closure part (2) and

the bag wall (16, 19) starting at a location outside the
centre of the female closure part (2) and extending from

there to the bag opening, characterized in that the
connection (17) between the spine (3) of the male closure

part (1) and the bag wall (15) starts at a location in
the region of the web of the hook (6) of the male closure

part (1), preferably in the centre of this web, and
extends from there to the bag opening, and in that the

connection (18, 17) between the spine (4, 3) of the
female and/or male closure part (2, 1) and the associated

bag wall (16, 15) terminates before the outer end of the
respective spine (4, 3).
Bag according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the connection (18) between the spine (4) of the female

closure part (2) and the bag wall (16, 19) starts in the
region of the outer hook (9) or web of the female closure

part (2), preferably on that side of the web of said hook
(9) which is directed towards the interior of the female

closure part.
Bag according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the bag wall (16, 15) projects

beyond the spine (4, 3) of the female and/or male closure
part (2, 1).
Bag according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, on the side which is directed away

from a hook tip (7), the hook (6) of the male closure
part (1) has a convexity (8), which is in the form of the

back of a head.
Bag according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, on their insides and/or outsides,

the hook spines (4, 3) have extensions (13, 14; 2, 1),
preferably short extensions.
Bag according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the vertical dimension of the hooks

(9, 10; 6) is two to three times the thickness of the
hook webs.
Bag according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the ratio of the length of the hook

tips (11, 12; 7) to the thickness of the web is 0.4 to 1.
