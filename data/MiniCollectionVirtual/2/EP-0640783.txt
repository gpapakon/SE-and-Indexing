<ABSTRACT>
In a high-pressure check valve (shut-off valve), particularly in a hydraulic pressure system with a high fluid delivery capacity, the pressure device for the valve element has a number of pressure rings, which are arranged as a stack and can be moved essentially in the axial direction, i.e. in the direction of the shut-off pressure pressing the valve element onto the valve seat, in such a way that, when adjacent pressure rings rest upon one another, the valve element is raised from the valve seat, while, in the shut-off position, the adjacent pressure rings are situated at a small distance from one another, within the hydraulic system subject to the high shut-off pressure.

<CLAIMS>
A check valve (6) for liquids being subjected to high pressure 
of more than 1000 bar, particularly, in a pressure system, 

comprising a valve body (7) shutting off the through opening on 
a valve seat under a shut-off pressure by means of a pressure 

means pressing against the valve body in the locking position 
until the liquid pressure directed from the valve seat for 

lifting off the valve body is higher than the shut-off pressure,
characterized in
 
that the pressure means comprises, instead of a pressure 

spring, a number (n) of separate thrust collars (14) being disposed 
as a stack adjacent or, respectively, on top of each 

other so that the axial direction (R) of the stack or the 
thrust collars (14), respectively, substantially corresponds to 

the direction of the shut-off pressure (P2) of the liquid under 
pressure on the valve body (7) against valve seat (8) and that 

said collars may substantially be moved in said axial direction 
(R) such that they permit the valve body (7) to be lifted off 

the valve seat (8) in the case of adjacent thrust collars, but 
are at substantially at a small spacing (H) from each other in 

the locking position. 
A check valve according to claim 1,
characterized in
 
that the maximum distance (Dmax) corresponds to the sum (m) of 

the individual spacings (H) of the thrust collars (14) in the 
locking condition of the valve body (7).  

 
A check valve according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in
 
that the thrust collars (14) are disposed in a pressure chamber 

(11) of a receiving sleeve (12) at whose outer free end (13) 
the valve body (7) is situated whereas the inner end of pressure 

chamber (11) serves as a stop (31) for the innermost 
thrust collar (14) and communicates with the liquid under the 

shut-off pressure (P2) by means of a through channel (15). 
A check valve according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in
 
that a ball is used as the valve body (7). 
A check valve according to claim 3 or 4,
characterized in
 
that the receiving chamber (12) comprises a diameter increasing 

towards the free end (13) such that the thrust collars (14) 
comprise a radial spacing against the chamber wall whereas the 

valve body (7) may penetrate into the receiving chamber (11) 
over just a small distance only and closes it in a pressed-back 

position. 
A check valve according to any of claims 3 - 5
characterized in
 
that the receiving sleeve (12) comprises detour channels (20) 

for the liquid outside the pressure chamber (11) from the outer 
free end thereof (13) up to the through channel (15). 
A check valve according to claim 6,
characterized in
 
that the receiving sleeve (12) comprises openings (17) leading 

from an outer groove (18) through the receiving sleeve (12) 
into an inner space (16) which is situated at the end of receiving 

sleeve (12) facing away from the outer free end (13) of 
the pressure chamber (11).  

 
A check valve according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in
 
that the valve seat (8) is situated on a pressure plate (10) 

comprising a recess (21) for receiving at least one aperture 
(22, 23) limiting the through cross-section of liquid to the 

valve seat (8). 
A check valve according to claim 8,
characterized in
 
that the aperture (22) comprises an aperture opening (22a) having 

a diameter of about 0.65 to 0.8 % of the diameter (Da) of 
the valve seat (8). 
A check valve according to claim 9,
characterized in
 
that the diameter of the aperture opening (22a) is about 0.7 to 

0.75 times the valve seat diameter (Da). 
A check valve according to any of claims 8 to 10,
characterized in
 
that the aperture (22, 23) is disposed within the recess (21) 

between the recess bottom (31) and an annular recess (26) on 
the front face of an extension of a distributor piece (24) 

whose axial inner bore (28) constitutes a through opening for 
liquids, and that the annular recess (26) communicates with the 

outer jacket of the distributor piece (24) and a suction pipe 
(2) via connecting channels (27).
