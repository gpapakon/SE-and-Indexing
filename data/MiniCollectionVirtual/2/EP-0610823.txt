<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat exchanger (20) having hollow profile plates (21) which are arranged at a distance from one another and are inserted with their ends into slots (31) of two retaining frames (30) and fixed therein, especially for laundry (linen) dryers (10). A permanent joint having a high withdrawal strength is achieved between the retaining frames (30) and the profile plates (21) with a low outlay on assembly by fixing the retaining frames (30) on the profile plates (21) by means of pegs (dowels) (40). The dowels (40) are inserted with their expanding elements into the hollow profile plates (21) and are clamped against the inner walls of the profile plates (21) by means of expanding pins driven into their dowel bore.

<CLAIMS>
A heat exchanger with hollow profile plates arranged spaced apart from 
each other, which are introduced by their ends into slits of two holding frames 

and are secured therein, in particular for laundry driers,
 
characterised in that
 
the holding frames (30) are secured by means of dowels (40) on the profile 

plates (21), in which the dowels (40) are introduced with their straddling 
elements (42, 43) from the exterior through the holding frames (30) into the 

hollow profile plates (21) and are braced against the inner walls of the profile 
plates (21) by means of straddling pins (45) driven into their dowel bore (41). 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the dowels (40) are separate from the holding frame (30) and rest with a collar 

or the like against the outer sides of the holding frames (30). 
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the dowels (40) are formed in one piece on the holding frames (30). 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
for each holding frame (30) four dowels (40) are provided, which are arranged 

in the end regions of the first and last slit (31) of the holding frames (30). 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the slits (31) of the holding frames (30) are provided in the region of the outer 

side with flanges (35), which serve as stops for the profile plates (21).  
 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the inner sides of the holding frames (30) are provided with an elastic covering 

which seals externally the introduced ends of the profile plates (21). 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the holding frames (30) carry cross-pieces formed on the inner side between the 

slits (31), which cross-pieces are likewise provided with elastic coverings. 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that
 
the profile plates (21) are divided into chambers by cross-pieces (22) and 

in that the dowels (40) are matched in cross-section to the cross-section of a 
chamber of the profile plates (21). 
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that
 
the dowel bores are constructed so as to narrow conically.
