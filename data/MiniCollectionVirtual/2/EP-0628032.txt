<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a series of quinazolin-4-ones, 
which are potent and selective inhibitors of 
cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase 
(cGMP PDE), having utility in a variety of therapeutic 
areas including the treatment of cardiovascular 
disorders such as angina, hypertension, heart failure 
and atherosclerosis. The compounds of the invention exhibit selectivity 
for inhibition of cGMP PDEs rather than cyclic 
adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterases (cAMP 
PDEs) and, as a consequence of this selective PDE 
inhibition, cGMP levels are elevated, which in turn can 
give rise to beneficial anti-platelet, anti-neutrophil, 
anti-vasospastic and vasodilatory activity, as well as 
potentiation of the effects of endothelium-derived 
relaxing factor (EDRF) and nitrovasodilators. Thus the 
compounds have utility in the treatment of a number of 
disorders, including stable, unstable and variant 
(Prinzmetal) angina, hypertension, pulmonary 
hypertension, congestive heart failure, 
atherosclerosis, conditions of reduced blood vessel 
patency e.g. post-percutaneous transluminal coronary 
angioplasty (post-PTCA), peripheral vascular disease, 
stroke, bronchitis, allergic asthma, chronic asthma, 
allergic rhinitis, glaucoma, and diseases characterised 
by disorders of gut motility, e.g. irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS). European patent application EP-A-0371731 discloses 
a group of quinazolin-4-ones as selective cGMP PDE 
inhibitors with bronchodilator and vasodilator activity 
of value in combatting asthma, bronchitis, angina, 
hypertension and congestive heart failure, but they are 
less potent as cGMP PDE inhibitors than those compounds 
hereinafter described. The compounds of the present invention have the 
formula (I):

alkyl, or together with the nitrogen atom to
