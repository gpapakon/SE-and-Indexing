<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method 
for making a higher moisture, reduced fat natural 

cheddar-type cheese product from partially or wholly fat 
reduced milk. The cheddar-type cheese product of the 

present invention has from about 45% to about 58% 
moisture and from about 1.3% to about 15% butterfat. In 

the method of the invention for making a reduced fat 
natural cheddar-type cheese, milk is standardized in fat 

content to produce a milk substrate having from about 
0.05% to about 2% milkfat. A culture system is added to 

the standardized milk. The culture system comprises a 
lactic acid starter culture and a ropy culture. 

Thereafter, the milk is fermented and set with a milk 
coagulating enzyme. The coagulum is cut to provide curd 

particles and whey and the curd particles are cooked in 
the whey at a temperature below the optimum growth 

temperature of the ropy culture. The whey is drained 
from the curd and the curd is rinsed, salted and filled 

into containers. The curd is pressed and vacuumed to 
remove additional whey, the container is sealed and the 

curd is cooled in the container. Thereafter, the curd 
blocks are cured to provide a natural cheddar type cheese 

product having a reduced fat level which is from about 
40% to about 60% of the fat level of conventional 

cheddar-type cheese products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
method for making a reduced fat or low fat natural cheese 
from reduced fat milk or skim milk. More particularly, 
the present invention is directed to producing a natural 
cheese product having from about 40% to about 98% reduced 
fat as compared to conventional cheddar cheese type 
products. The health advantages in reducing the fat 
content of various food products has long been 
recognized. When fat in cheese is reduced significantly, 
the composition of cheese changes and the body, texture 
and flavor are negatively impacted. A reduced fat 
cheese has higher protein and moisture and the incidence 
of bitterness in such a product is higher. Even with the 
higher moisture in lower fat cheese, the mouthfeel and 
texture is coarse and dry. Natural cheese made from skim 
milk is very firm, inelastic, has a dry mouthfeel and 
does not dissolve in the mouth. American style cheese, such as cheddar cheese 
and colby, is a particularly popular cheese and vast 
quantities of cheddar cheese are produced and sold each 
year. It would be highly desirable to produce a reduced 
fat natural cheddar cheese type product which has a body, 
texture and flavor comparable to natural, full-fat 
cheddar cheese. When the fat content of milk is reduced 
to a level such that a 33% reduction of fat in the 
finished cheese is attained, the body, texture and flavor 
of the natural cheese produced from the milk is not too 
severely compromised. At levels of fat reduction above 
about 40%, however, the deterioration in body, texture 
and flavor and the increase in bitterness is readily 
noticeable.  The present invention is directed to producing 
a natural American style cheese product from milk which 
has a reduced level of fat such that the final natural 
cheddar-type cheese product has less than about 40% of 
the normal fat content of cheddar cheese and has up to 
about 98% less fat content than the normal fat content. There are several known methods for producing 
cheddar-type cheese products. In one method for the manufacture of cheddar 
cheese, a batch of milk is placed in a cheese vat and is 
inoculated with a lactic acid starter. After the desired 
degree of lactic acid development has been attained, 
rennet is added to set or coagulate the milk. When the 
resulting curd has attained the proper degree of 
firmness, the curd is cut into cubes with curd knives. 
The curd is then agitated in the whey and heated to a 
temperature of about 100°F to about 105°F (about 37°C to about

<CLAIMS>
A method for making a reduced fat natural cheddar-type 
cheese comprising: 


(a) providing milk having from about 0.05% to about 
2.0% milkfat; 
(b) adding a culture system to said milk, said 
culture system comprising a lactic acid starter culture and 

a ropy culture, and fermenting said milk; 
(c) setting said milk with a milk coagulating 
enzyme; 
(d) cutting said milk to provide curd particles in 
whey; 
(e) cooking said curd particles in said whey at a 
temperature below the optimum growth temperature of said 

ropy culture, and 
(f) draining whey from said curd, knitting said 
curd, milling said knitted curd, forming said milled curd 

into blocks, pressing said blocks to remove additional whey 
and curing said blocks to provide a reduced fat natural 

cheddar-type cheese with improved flavor and texture. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said ropy 

culture is selected from the group consisting of 
Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and 

Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus 
lactis ssp. hollandicus and Leuconostoc mesenteroidis ssp. 

dextranicum
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
ropy culture is a thermophilic species and said cook of said 

curd particles in whey is at a temperature below the optimum 
growth temperature of said ropy culture. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said ropy 
culture is a mesophilic species. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said ropy 
culture is a thermophilic species. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein 
proteolytic and lipolytic microorganisms are added to said 

milk prior to setting said milk. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein 
said natural cheddar-type cheese product is a reduced fat
