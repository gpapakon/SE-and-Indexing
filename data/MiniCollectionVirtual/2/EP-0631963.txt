<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides spirally wound paperboard 
cores (10) for winding of textiles and other materials 

and which have enhanced high speed winding capability. 
The spirally wound paperboard plies (32,34,36,38,40,42; 

Fig. 2) forming the body wall (12) of the paperboard core 
(10) have a predetermined spiral winding angle (!5) with 

respect to the axis (20) of the cylindrical body wall 
(12) of greater than about 71 degrees. In winding cores 

having a relatively large ID of between about 4.8 in. 
(120 mm) and 6 in. (150 mm), the paperboard plies forming 

the spirally wound cores have a winding angle of greater 
than about 74 degrees. In winding cores having a lower 

ID of less than about 4.8 inches (120 mm), all of the 
paperboard plies have a width of about 3.5 in. (89 mm) or 

less and a spiral winding angle of greater than about 71 
degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to paperboard 
winding cores for textiles and other materials and 
which have improved capabilities for withstanding high 
winding speeds. More specifically, the invention is 
directed to spirally wound paperboard winding cores 
having a high spiral winding angle for enhancement of 
high speed winding of textile filaments and yarns and 
other materials. Spirally wound paperboard tubes are widely 
used in textile and other industries as cores for 
winding of filaments, yarns, and other materials such 
as films as they are produced. Although paperboard is 
relatively weak on a single layer basis, a tube 
constructed from multiple spirally wound paperboard 
layers can attain substantial strength. In the textile industry, yarn winding speeds 
have increased dramatically in recent years. Currently 
available textile winders are capable of operating at 
winding speeds of up to 8,000 m/min. High winding 
speeds result in the application of significant forces 
to the textile cores as is well known in the art. For 
example, U.S. Patent 3,980,249 to Cunningham et al., 
issued in 1976, reported the phenomena of 
disintegrating and exploding high speed textile cores 
with winding speeds of 3660 m/min (12,000 feet per minute). 
The significant increases in textile winding 
speeds since that time have worsened the known 
problems.  
 Winders can be drum driven or spindle driven. 
Drum driven winders employ a driven winding drum having 
a drive land which circumferentially contacts the 
surface of the textile core curing start up and rapidly 
increases the surface speed of the textile core to the 
desired winding speed. Currently available drum winders 
are capable of accelerating the speed of the textile 
core from rest to 6,000 m/min in as little as five 
seconds. Spindle driven winders accelerate the textile 
core from rest to the desired winding speed at a much 
lower rate of acceleration using a driven spindle 
supported coaxially within the interior of the textile 
core. These winders include a bail roll having a drive 
land which contacts the surface of the rotating tube 
under pressure. The forces exerted on the textile cores 
particularly during start up of a high speed winding 
operation thus include compressive forces (head 
pressure) such as are exerted by contact between the 
drive land and the face of the textile core; shear and 
abrasive forces such as are exerted by the driven 
winding drum during initial acceleration of the textile 
core surface; tensile forces resulting from
