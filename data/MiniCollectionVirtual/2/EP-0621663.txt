<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an optical fiber amplifier 
including an amplification optical fiber (22) doped with an 

active material for the optical amplification for 
amplifying signal light by applying the signal light and 

pumping light to the amplification optical fiber to amplify 
the signal light. The optical fiber amplifier comprises 

optical coupling/dividing means (28) for coupling pumping light 
emitted from a plurality of light sources for optical 

pumping (25,27), and branching the coupled light into output 
forward pumping light and backward pumping light, a first 

optical coupler (20) for coupling the forward pumping light with 
signal light to apply the coupled light to the input 

terminal of the amplification optical fiber, and a second 
coupler (23) for coupling the backward pumping light with the 

amplified signal light to apply the coupled light to the 
output terminal of the amplification optical fiber, whereby 

stable amplification and a good redundancy can be provided 
by the forward and the backward pumping light incident both 

on the input and the output terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
For the realization of longer-distance transmission and 
super-capacities of optical transmission systems, 
developments and studies on repeaters, booster amplifiers, 
etc. using optical fiber amplifiers in place of EO/OE 
conversion have been recently noted. An optical fiber 
amplifier uses as an amplification medium an amplification 
optical fiber having the core doped with a trace of a rare 
earth element an active ions, and does the optical 
amplification by stimulated emission when signal light is 
incident simultaneously with the pumping light. To fulfil longer-distance transmission and super-capacities 
of the optical transmission systems, stable 
amplifying ratios and high reliability are required. The 
prior art of the optical fiber amplifier relevant to these 
requirements are U.S. Patent Nos. 5138621, 4723804, 4674830 
and 5125066. A conventional optical fiber amplifier has the 
structure of, e.g., FIG 22. This conventional optical 
fiber amplifier comprises an optical amplification passage 
including an optical isolator 1, an optical coupler 2, an 
amplification optical fiber 3, an optical isolator 4, and 
a monitor coupler 5 inserted in an optical fiber for signal 
light to be incident on the input terminal thereof in the  
 
stated order, whereby the signal light is amplified by the 
amplification optical fiber and outputted through the 
output terminal. There are further provided a pair of light 
sources for optical pumping 7, 8 for generating pumping 
light (laser beams) by an electric power supplied by an 
automatic electric power control unit 6, and an optical 
switch or a polarization multiplier 9 for applying the 
pumping light to the optical coupler 2. The monitor coupler 5 branches a part of the amplified 
signal light supplied by the optical isolator 4 and 
propagates the name to a photoelectric device 10, such as a 
photodiode or others. The monitor unit 11 amplifies a 
photoelectric signal from the photoelectric device 10 to 
supply the same to the automatic electric power control unit 
6. The automatic electric power control unit 6 feedback-controls 
electric powers to the light sources 7, 8 so that 
the photoelectric signal from the monitor circuit 11 always 
have a constant level, whereby the pumping light to the 
amplification optical fiber 3 always has a constant 
intensity and a constant amplifying ratio. In the case that the optical switch 9 is provided by an 
optical fiber amplifier, in a normal operation the optical 
switch 9 operates to apply only the pumping light
