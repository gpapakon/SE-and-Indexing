<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cyanate resin 
composition. The cyanate resin of this invention is 
particularly useful as a resin for laminates in the 
electric and electronic fields in which low-dielectric 
property is required, and is also applicable to uses of 
sealing and molding. Among the thermosetting resin compositions 
which have heretofore been used in the electric and 
electronic fields, the materials for printed wiring base 
board are mainly combinations of bisphenol type epoxy 
resins with dicyandiamides and adducts of bismaleimide 
compounds and amine compounds. Recently, accompanying 
the multilayering of printed wiring boards, the resins 
therefor have seen required to have low-dielectric 
property mainly for the purpose of increasing the signal 
transfer rate. In the conventional thermosetting resin 
compositions, it is wellknown to add a low-dielectric 
thermoplastic resin thereto for meeting such requirements. 
However, according to this method, such a 
disadvantage has been pointed out that the heat 
resistance of the thermosetting resin is impaired, and 
hence, the resulting resin composition has not 
sufficiently satisfied the requirement of a low-dielectric 
resin withstanding practical use.  
 Under such circumstances, a cyanate resin has 
been developed and is disclosed in German Patent No. 
2533122, WO 88/05443 and the like. Cyanate resins which 
are now generally used are dicyanates of bisphenol A 
which have a relatively low-dielectric property. 
However, the enhancement of computer technique results in 
a requirement for much lower-dielectric property. The present inventors have conducted extensive 
research on the skeleton of a cyanate compound, and have 
consequently found that an increase of molecular volume 
due to the bulkiness of t-butyl group and an increase of 
nonpolarity due to a large hydrophobic group contribute 
greatly the low-dielectric property and a composition of 
a specific cyanate having the t-butyl group and the large 
hydrophobic group can solve the problems of prior art. An object of this invention is to provide a 
cyanate resin composition which is excellent in low-dielectric 
property and give a cured product having heat 
resistance withstanding practical use. Another object of this invention is to provide 
a copper-clad laminate using the cyanate resin 
composition. Other objects and advantages of this invention 
will become apparent from the following description. According to this invention, there is provided  
 
a cyanate resin composition, which
