<ABSTRACT>
An agitator blade (2) comprises a plurality of local 
agitators (22) mounted on a mounting frame (21), which in turn 

is secured to an agitator shaft (12). The agitator shaft (12) 
is rotated by a motor (13) to drive the local agitators (22) to 

mix the fluid thoroughly. When applied for agitation 
and mixing processes, the agitator blade (2) of this 

invention can realize a high degree of mixing easily 
and reliably in a short period of time and with a 

small driving power. Further, the construction of 
this agitator blade (2) is simple.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agitator
blade and more particularly to an agitator blade
which is capable of mixing fluids efficiently and
reliably.Among widely used agitator blades are turbine
blades, oar blades, marine blades and ribbon blades.
When these conventional agitator blades are used for
agitating and mixing within small equipment or
tanks, a high degree of mixing close to 1 can be
reached in a relatively short time without trouble
with a single agitator blade.When such agitator blades are used in large-scale
tanks in plants, however, the use of only one agitator
blade may result in an unexpected dead space being
formed in the tanks, taking a protracted length of
time to mix fluids at a sufficiently high degree of
mixing. Even after many hours of mixing operation,
it is often not possible to achieve a high degree of
mixing that is easily realized for small-scale
equipment and tanks.One possible way to cope with such a situation
is to increase the number of agitator blades. There
is, however, a limit on the number of agitator blades
that can be used in the tank. Even if the number of
agitator blades is increased to as many as is allowable
in the tank, the degree of mixing does not increase in
proportion to an increase in the number of agitator
blades. The additional agitator blades on the other
hand require additional driving power, significantly
increasing the operation cost. After having conducted research on ways to
eliminate aforementioned drawbacks experienced with
the conventional agitator blades, the inventors of
this invention have developed an agitator blade which
is simple in construction and can achieve a high
degree of mixing easily and reliably and with a
minimum amount of driving power, and which comprises
a plurality of local agitators for simultaneous
agitation at multiple locations. DE-U-85 28 381 discloses an agitator blade being mounted on a rotatable
agitator shaft. The agitator blade comprises a mounting frame on which radially oriented
hollow cylinders are mounted. The hollow cylinders have upwardly inclined inner edges.
The outer axial ends of the cylinders lie in a plane which is oriented perpendicularly to the
central axis of the cylinders."Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook", 6th Edition, pages 19-5, 19-6,
discloses several types of radial-flow impellers having marine-type mixing propellers or
being provided in the form of turbines with pitched, curved or flat plates.SU-A-1 278 010 discloses an industrial mixer which comprises a vertical
rotating shaft carrying

<CLAIMS>
An agitator blade comprising:

a mounting frame having opposing sides and being secured to a rotatable
agitator shaft,
at least one local agitator having cylinders mounted on said mounting frame,
said at least one local agitator being arranged radially in relation to said
agitator shaft, and having first and second axial ends, the first and second ends both being

open with respect to said mounting frame and spaced from said agitator shaft, the first
axial end being disposed closer to the agitator shaft and the second axial end being

disposed more remote from the agitator shaft,
each of the first and second axial ends having a leading edge and a trailing
edge in relation to the direction of rotation, and
the radial distance from said leading edge of the second axial end to said
agitator shaft being greater than the radial distance from said trailing edge of the second

axial end to the agitator shaft.
An agitator blade as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cylinders are square
cylinders.
An agitator blade as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein each local agitator
internally contains at least one plate.
