<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a filler nozzle (pipe) for a fuel tank, particularly for a motor vehicle, of the sort including a tubular body (2) of frustoconical shape, a fastening assembly for securing to the filler mouth of the tank, the tubular body (2) having a moving flap (4) at its downstream end, the moving flap being held at rest in the closure position by an elastic means. The tubular body (2) is extended downstream of the movable flap (4) by a semi-cylindrical gutter section (6) whose axis of revolution extends the axis of symmetry of the frustoconical tubular body (2).

Filler pipe for a fuel tank, in particular for a motor 
vehicle, of the type having a tapered tubular body (2), a fixing 

assembly for connection to the filling orifice of the tank, the 
tubular body (2) having at its downstream end (3) a movable flap 

(4) held at rest in the closure position by an elastic means, the 
tubular body (2) being extended, downstream of the movable flap 

(4), by a semi-cylindrical channel (6) whose axis of revolution 
extends the longitudinal axis (7) of the tapered tubular body 

(2), characterised in that the said channel (6) has a cross 
section in the shape of a semi-circle of 180 degrees, the said 

channel being symmetrical with respect to a plane perpendicular 
to the pivot axis (5) of the closure flap (4) and passing through 

the longitudinal axis (7) of the body (2). 
Filler pipe for a fuel tank according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the channel (6) has at its downstream end 

a stop extending transversely. 
Filler pipe for a fuel tank according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the said stop is formed by two wings (8, 

9) extending radially towards the longitudinal axis (7), along 
the lower edge of the channel (6). 
Filler pipe for a fuel tank according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the said stop is formed by a transverse 

bar. 
Filler pipe for a fuel tank according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the said stop is formed by an annular ring 

coaxial with the axis of the pipe.
