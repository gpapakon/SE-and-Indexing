<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chair assembly 
designed to be of maximum comfort and sturdiness in a 
vehicle such as a locomotive, which shakes and vibrates 
when in motion. Heavy vehicles, particularly locomotives of the 
type in use today have limited space in the cabin. Thus it 
is not easy for the driver or other personnel to get into 
or leave the driver's seat. In addition, it is sometimes 
necessary for the locomotive driver to look out the side 
window for some railroad work such as yard stitching. Accordingly, it is known to provide a seat which 
is slidably mounted on a rail so that the seat can slide 
forwardly or rearwardly in the cabin. For example, U.S. 
Patent no. 5,118,062 issued on June 2, 1992 to one of the 
instant inventors, Mr. Archambault, teaches the use of a 
seat attached to the side wall of a locomotive driver's 
cabin in a cantilever manner. The seat that can be easily 
adjusted horizontally along a rail attached to the side 
wall of the cabin, is pivotally mounted on a vertical axis 
by means of a threaded shaft extending into a threaded 
sleeve which allows the seat to be raised or lowered by 
turning the same. It has been found that such a mounting of the 
seat with a threaded shaft extending into a threaded sleeve 
is unsatisfactory. Over a period of time, the threaded 
shaft and threaded sleeve tend to wobble and become loose 
due to the movement of the locomotive described above. 
This becomes a major source of discomfort and back pain 
especially when a train is on a long trip.  Moreover, for the yard switching mentioned above, 
the seat disclosed in the above patent cannot be moved 
laterally. As a matter of fact, it is mounted at a fixed 
distance from the side wall of the locomotive. This 
results in an undesirable stretching and twisting of the 
back when the driver wants to look out of the side window. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a chair assembly for use in the driver's cabin of a 
locomotive although the invention is not exclusively 
restricted to that application, which obviates at least 
some of the above-mentioned disadvantages. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
chair assembly of the above mentioned type, which is 
comfortable for drivers of varying physical proportions. The chair assembly according to the invention as 
it is broadly claimed hereinafter, basically comprises:
 
   a chair having a seat and a backrest; and
 
   a chair supporting height-adjustable base including 
mounting means to provide rotation, smooth
