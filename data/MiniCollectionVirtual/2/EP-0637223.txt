<ABSTRACT>
A first inflatable retraction device has a first inflatable chamber (5) and a non-pressurized chamber (13) inside the main chamber. The non-pressurized chamber is expanded by inflating a second inflatable chamber (25). The non-pressurized chamber enables the main chamber to remain inflated when an aperture is cut in the envelope of the main chamber, through which treatment is carried out. A second inflatable retraction device has an inflatable retractor (103) and a maintainer (107). The inflatable retractor retracts the organ and the maintainer maintains the organ in its retracted condition after the inflatable retractor is deflated. The maintainer can be inflatable, and can be inside or outside the inflatable retractor. A self-retracting endoscope (201) has an optical assembly with an expandable retractor (211) fitted to its distal end. The distal end of the endoscope is inserted into the body with the retractor in a collapsed condition. The retractor is then expanded to retract organs that would otherwise obstruct the view from the distal end of the optical assembly. After observations are complete, the retractor is returned to its collapsed condition. An insertion tube (243) enables cylindrical objects, such as packaged inflatable retraction devices, to be pulled, instead of pushed, into the body. The additional chamber of an inflatable retraction device having two inflatable chambers is filled with a slurry of a particulate solid in a liquid. The liquid is removed and the additional chamber evacuated to consolidate the particulate solid. This increases the retracting strength of the additional chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an apparatus for retracting
an organ inside the body to gain access to an adjacent tissue
according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1.The invention relates to devices for use in laparoscopic surgery, in particular, to
devices that provide retraction of an organ to gain access to treat or observe a tissue.Laparoscopy dates back to the turn of the 20th Century. Early laparoscopic
techniques were used primarily for diagnostic purposes to view the internal organs,
without the necessity of conventional surgery. Since the 1930s, laparoscopy has been
used for sterilization and, more recently, for suturing hernias. US-A- 4,919,152
and 4,944,443 are concerned with techniques for suturing hernias. Another recent
innovation is the use of laparoscopic surgery for removing the gallbladder.Published International Application No. WO-A 92/21291, which was published on 10.12.92 and
is thus not to be considered as prior art, describes an apparatus and method wherein the
abdominal wall is lifted away from the underlying abdominal organs by an inflatable
device which is introduced laparoscopically and, once in place, inflated to engage and
lift an extensive area of the abdominal wall.Even when such lifting techniques are used, it is still necessary to retract other
organs to gain access to the organ or tissue to be treated or observed. In other
procedures, to gain access to the organ or tissue to be treated or observed, the organ to
be treated must be separated from tissue surrounding it. To obtain the necessary
retraction, current laparoscopic procedures use several small metal or plastic retractors
inserted through a plurality of incisions. Because such retractors have a relatively small
surface area, they tend to damage and/or cause trauma to the retracted organs or tissue.
Moreover, the requirement for a plurality of incisions to heal may delay the patient's
recovery.Published International Application No. WO-A 92/21293 (the "prior application"), which was
published on 10.12.92 and is thus not to be considered as prior art, describes a number of
retraction 
devices that are introduced into the body in a collapsed condition and, once in place, are
expanded by inflating a main inflatable chamber, to retract organs or tissues and to
provide access to the organ or tissue being treated. The retraction devices described in
the application provide a relatively large surface area to the organ or tissue being
retracted so that retraction can take place with a minimal risk of damage to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (1) for retracting an organ (L)
inside the body to gain access to an adjacent tissue (GB),

the apparatus comprising:

a first inflatable means (5) for retracting the organ
when the first inflatable means is inflated to an expanded

condition, the first inflatable means having a first
envelope (3), and
means (7) for selectively inflating the first
inflatable means into an expanded condition when in place

in the body; characterized by:

a non-pressurized chamber (13) inside the first
inflatable means, the non-pressurized chamber having a

second envelope (11), part of the second envelope being
attached to part of the first envelope;
a second inflatable means (25); operably associated
with the non-pressurized chamber, for expanding the non-pressurized

chamber into an expanded condition when the
second inflatable means is inflated;
means (35) for selectably inflating the second
inflatable means, and
means (31) for providing a substantially gas-tight
passage for an instrument to pass into the non-pressurized

chamber.
The apparatus of claim 1, further characterized in
that the second inflatable means (25) has a cage structure.
The apparatus of claim 1, further characterized in
that the second inflatable means includes a toroidal

balloon (43).
The apparatus of any of claims 1 through 3,
further characterized in that the means for providing a

substantially gas-tight passage for an object to pass into
the non-pressurized chamber comprises a gas-tight port (31)

between the first inflatable chamber (3) and the non-pressurized

chamber (13).
The apparatus of claim 4, further characterized in
that: 


at least part of the second envelope (11) comprises
an elastomeric material (29), and
the elastomeric material forms the gas-tight port

inserted into the gas-tight passage, and
b) a substantially gas-tight seal when the object is
not inserted in the gas-tight passage.
