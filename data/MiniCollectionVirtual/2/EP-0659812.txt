<ABSTRACT>
Low thermal conductivity insulation for 
refrigerators and the like is produced by blowing a resinous 

foam in an inert (e.g., nitrogen) atmosphere with a mixture 
of carbon dioxide and a low thermal conductivity inert gas 

such as krypton or xenon. The foam is then sealed in a gas-impervious 
enclosure and carbon dioxide is removed 

therefrom, typically by inclusion in said enclosure of a 
solid material reacted therewith such as an alkaline 

reagent. The final partial pressure of the low thermal 
conductivity gas in the enclosure is in the range of about 

20-200 torr, and the total pressure is up to 110% of said 
partial pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to insulating foams, and
more particularly to foams having unusually low thermal
conductivity.Insulating foam, particularly polyurethane foam,
is an indispensable constituent of many refrigerators and
similar cooling units. By reason of increasingly strict
Federal Government energy conservation standards, it is of
interest to develop foams having substantially lower
thermal conductivity than those presently available.Conventional insulating polyurethane foam is
generally prepared by the reaction of at least one polyol
with at least one diisocyanate in the presence of suitable
catalysts, surfactants and blowing agents. Among the
blowing agents employed are halogenated compounds, which
may be halocarbons such as monofluorotrichloromethane
and/or halohydrocarbons such as 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane.
They remain in the cell voids of the foam
after blowing, and their presence therein is beneficial since
they have low thermal conductivity and thus contribute to
the insulating quality of the foam.Also usually present in the reaction mixture is
water, which serves at least three purposes. First, in small
quantities it is effective to improve the flow properties of
the mixture. Second, it reacts with a minor proportion of
the diisocyanate to form carbon dioxide, which is also
effective as a blowing agent. Third, it reacts to form
substituted urea crosslinking moieties, thus stabilizing the
foam as it is produced. The use of many halocarbons is now severely
restricted and will soon be prohibited by reason of their
property of depleting the stratospheric ozone layer.
Halohydrocarbons are an interim solution but their use will
ultimately also be prohibited. It is therefore necessary to
develop methods for blowing insulating foam which do not
require the use of halogen-containing blowing agents. At
the same time, however, a high degree of insulating power
is more necessary than ever to decrease energy
consumption. An additional desirable factor is suppression
of the "greenhouse effect" which promotes global warming.Carbon dioxide has a high thermal conductivity,
on the order of 17 milliwatts/m-Â°K. Thus, a foam prepared
with the use of a blowing agent combination including 15%
and 50% (by volume) carbon dioxide with the balance being
monofluorotrichloromethane has a thermal conductivity
approximately 5% and 15%, respectively, higher than a
corresponding foam prepared without the use of carbon
dioxide.It would thus be of considerable interest to
devise methods for producing insulating foam which
