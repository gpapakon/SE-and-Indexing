<ABSTRACT>
The production method relates to a contact hole which exposes an underlying first conducting layer (2) which is insulated with respect to an overlying second conducting layer (4) which is covered with a second insulating layer (5). According to the invention, after etching the second insulating layer (5), the second conducting layer (4) is isotropically etched so that a gap (7) results below the second insulating layer (5), this gap being filled by producing insulating spacers (9) on the side walls of the contact hole. Since only thin spacers (9) are required, the contact surface (8') is enlarged in comparison with known methods. Using the method particularly advantageous bit-line contact holes can be produced in the case of DRAM memory cells having a bit line arranged on the capacitor.
