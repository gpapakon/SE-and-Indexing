<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling carrier concentration at 
the interface of oppositely doped regions of a 

semiconductor device is provided. According to a 
preferred method, the threshold voltage of a graded 

channel field effect device is thereby controlled. 
Preferably, spacers (80,82) are provided adjacent a gate 

electrode (56) to offset the location of the extent 
(88,90) of source/drain regions (84,86) within graded 

channel regions (60,62). The extent (88,90) of the 
source/drain regions (84,86) are thereby located at a 

desired point of the carrier concentration profile of the 
graded channel regions (60,62).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor 
devices, and more particularly, to controlling the 
carrier concentrations of doped regions at their 
interfaces. It is often desirable to control the carrier 
concentration profiles of various doped regions of a 
semiconductor device, with respect to one another. For 
example, double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (DMOS) 
devices present a particular problem which requires 
controlling the carrier concentration profile of various 
doped regions with respect to one another. The well-known techniques for fabricating DMOS 
devices have been found very useful in the past for a 
variety of reasons. For example, in the case of field 
effect devices, diffused channel and source/drain regions 
result in self-alignment of the respective active 
regions. The self-alignment provides simplified 
processing and more dense device packing. Additionally, 
diffusing channel regions under the gate results in 
varying carrier concentrations across the length of the 
gate. This is known as a graded channel, and provides 
advantages such as higher carrier mobility, and 
consequently better device performance. FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-section view of a DMOS 
field effect device of the prior art. FIG. 1 shows one 
of many substantially identical devices which may be 
found on a chip (die). Semiconductor substrate 10 is 
provided. Oxide insulating layer 12 lies on top of the  
 
substrate. Gate electrode 14 lies on top of the 
insulating layer 12. Channel region 16 comprises the 
diffused graded channel portions 18 and 19 and a well 
portion 20. Graded channel regions 18 and 19 have been 
implanted and diffused both vertically and laterally 
beneath gate electrode 14, resulting in respective graded 
carrier concentration profiles, described in more detail 
below. The prior art device further comprises source/drain 
region 22 and source/drain region 24. Source/drain 
regions 22 and 24 are also implanted and diffused beneath 
gate electrode 14, as is well known in the art. The 
resultant DMOS field effect device provides the above 
discussed advantages associated with the self-aligned 
process. However, the DMOS field effect device of the 
prior art presents a particular disadvantage with regard 
to controlling the threshold voltage of the device. The threshold voltage (Vth) relates to the voltage 
at which a device turns on. It is highly desirable to 
control the Vth so that it's value is consistent for any 
particular product. Vth affects critical performance 
parameters
