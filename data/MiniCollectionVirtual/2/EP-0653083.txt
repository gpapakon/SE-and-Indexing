<ABSTRACT>
A time recording device (10) includes a bar code reader (11), a display (12), an internal, programmed microprocessor with real-time clock and associated memory, and menu control means (13). When a bar code carried, for example, by a case file is scanned by the device, the latter immediately starts to allocate time to that case and displays this time on the display (12); any previously-current case has its timing frozen and is no longer displayed. Against the current case can be set in specific time and disbursement items, preferably by scanning in appropriate bar codes. The total time spent in a current working session may also be timed. An interrupt button (14) enables a user to immediately start timing and interrupt with timing of the current case being temporarily suspended.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ΗME RECORDING DEVICEThe present invention relates to a time-recording device for use in particular, but not exclusively, in an office to record time and disbursements incurred against particular cases (for example, client patent application files in a firm of patent attorneys).It is known to provide a programmable, hand-held bar-cod reader device with a display, internal microprocessor, memory and real-time clock, an example of such a device being the Microwand II E produced by Hand Held Products Inc. of Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. A typical example of the use of such a device would -be to track actions on objects that carry identifying bar codes. Each scanning of the code on an object is arranged to create an internal record including a time stamp. These time-stamped records are subsequently used for monitoring and analysis purposes.Existing devices do not, however, provide for the ready monitoring of time spent on a succession of cases such as may be worked on in an office; furthermore, there is no provision to associate both time and disbursement items with the same case. 
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a time-recording device comprising: case control means responsive to user input to provide a case record that is thereupon taken as the current case record to the exclusion of other case records previously provided by the device, timing means for timing at least one period relevant to the current case-record , display means for enabling the current value of a said at least one period being timed by the timing means to be displayed, - user-controlled ID reading means for reading in case identities (IDs): and association means for associating a case ID read in by the ID reading means with a particular said case record.The said user input to which the case control means is responsive to provide a case record, is preferably the reading in of a case ID in which event the said association means is arranged to associate a read-in case ID with the case record provided by the case control means in response to the reading in of that case ID. Thus, for example, if case files fat an office have identifying bar codes that can be read in by the ID reading means, a αser simply needs to scan the identifying bar code of each file as h is picked up to be worked on, and the time spent on the file is automatically noted and displayed.An alternative arrangement for starting a case would be to provide user-operable start means, such as a posh button, shich when operated caused the

 CLAIMS
1. A time-recording device comprising: - case control means responsive to user input to provide a case record that is thereupon taken as the current case record to the exclusion of other case records previously provided by the device, timing means for timing at ieast one period relevant to the current case- recoid, - display means for enabling the current vaiue of a said at least one period being timed by the timing means to be displayed, user-controlled ID reading means for reading in case identities (IDs); and association means for associating a case ID read in by the ID reading means with a particular said case record.
2. A time-recording device according to Claim 1, wherein the said user input to which the case control means is responsive to provide a case record, is the reading in of a case ID; said association means being operative to associate a read-in case ID with the case record provided by the case control means in response to the reading in of that case, ID.
3. A time-recording device according to Claim 1. wherein said case control means includes user-operable start means for providing, independantly of said ID reading means, the said user input to which the case control means is responsive to provide a case record ; the association means being operative to associate a read-in case ID with the current case record.
4. A time-recording device according to Claim 1. wherein said case control means includes teπmnation means responsive to user input to terminate timing in respect of the said current case record without initiating timing for another case. 


5. A time-recording device according to Claim 1. wherein said at least one period timed by the timing means includes the total period for which a said case record is the current case record.
6. A time-recording device according to Claim 1 , wherein the device is of stand
¬
 alone, hand-held form with memory means for storing said case records, ώe device being operative to create and store a new case record for each new case ID read during a working session, and die device further comprising download means for enabling the case records stored during a working session to be downloaded to other apparatus.
7. A time-recording device according to Claim 1 further comprising:
D-Item selection means operative when a case record is current to enable a user to select a disbursement item (D-Item) ID, - D-item control means responsive to selection of a D-Item ID to provide a corresponding item record associated with the case record forming the current case record, and input means for inputting a measure and storing it with said item record.
B. A time-recording device according to claim 7, wherein said D-Item selection means is constituted by said ID-reading means adapted to read D-Item IDs and to distinguish them as such from case IDs.
