<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the use of new and improved
antiviral, nucleosides and
nucleotides.The immune system is an inherently complex system that
serves its host by providing natural resistance and recovery
against both pathogens of an external source as well as
aberrant 'self' cells, i.e. tumor growth. It provides both
'natural', i.e. inborn and unchanging, or 'acquired' , i.e.
adaptive immune response.For the most part the immune system is innocuous to
'self.' The immune system is able, in most instances, to
recognize 'self,' its host, and differentiate between 'self'
and non-self. That is the immune system is 'self tolerant.'
In certain instances, however, the immune system does attack
its host as if it were foreign resulting in autoimmunity or
autoimmune disease or hypersensitivity expressed in the form
of allergies, certain forms of kidney disease and the like.While for the most part an effective and active immune
system confers biological advantages for the host, modern
medicine has sought in certain instances to repress the
immune system because of autoimmunity hypersensitivity in
graft or organ transplant and in other instances stimulate
the immune system by immunization. It is therefore advantageous
in certain instances to attempt to stimulate the
immune system against pathogen or tumor attack and in other
instances to repress the immune system when it becomes self 
destructive to the host or for organ transplant or the like.While most molecular entities either synthetic or
natural which are known to stimulate the immune system are
large molecules such as interferon, poly I:C or large
messenger proteins, certain small molecules have also been
shown to modulate the immune system as well. Of the small
molecular entities the nucleoside 3-deaza-adenosine has been
indicated in U. S. Patent 4,309,419 to Walberg, et al.,
which issued January 5, 1982, as being an inhibitor of the
immune response. Other nucleosides, most notably 8-bromoguanosine,
8-mercaptoguanosine and 7-methyl-8-oxoguanosine
have been noted as showing stimulation of the immune system.Certain components of the immune system are cellular in
nature while others are humoral, that is they exist free in
serum or other body fluids. Adaptive immunity is based upon
special properties of lymphocytes. The lymphocyte populations
are generally divided between T lymphocytes commonly
called T cells and B lymphocytes commonly called B cells.
The T lymphocytes undergo a maturation processing in the
thymus whereas the B lymphocytes are
