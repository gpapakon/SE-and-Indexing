<ABSTRACT>
Surgical sewing machine for suturing of tissue edges (A, B), which comprises an oscillatingly driven needle (1) and a shuttle hook (2) interacting with the needle (1) for making the stitches. In order to support the tissue edges (A, B) in the region of the movement path of the needle (1) extending transversely through the tissue edges (A, B), there is a forceps (32) having two legs (33, 34) which can be moved into a closed position before each insertion of the needle (1) into the tissue edges (A, B) in order to hold the tissue edges (A, B) together and which can be moved into an open position after the subsequent emergence of the needle (1) from the tissue edges (A, B) in order to release the tissue edges (A, B). Furthermore, there may be an advance forceps (120) having two legs (121, 122) which can be moved into a closed position for gripping of the tissue edges (A, B) immediately beyond the forceps (32) and into an open position for release of the tissue edges (A, B), and which can be moved from an initial position during each opening phase of the forceps (32) in the closed position in the advance direction (29) and counter to the advance direction back into the initial position during each closing phase of the forceps (32) in the open position.
