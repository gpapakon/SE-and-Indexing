<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fouling control of harmful aquatic organisms
which adhere to various water-exposed articles. The term "water-exposed articles" is
used herein to cover marine vessels, buoys, littoral industrial plants, inlet channels for
cooling water in thermal or nuclear power stations, drilling rigs for submarine oil fields, and
harbor facilities and sea pollution preventive bands for ocean civil engineering works.As there can be found many kinds of animals and plants living in the sea,
various organisms may often adhere to water-exposed articles and have adverse effects
thereon. The adhesion of such harmful aquatic organisms will cause a decrease in the
service speed and an increase in the fuel consumption of marine vessels, and a decrease in
the carrying capacity of inlet channels of cooling water.BE-A-766,264 (corresponding to Japanese Patent Publication
No. 51-113/1976) discloses that certain benzisothiazoline-3-ones
have antibacterial and antifungal properties.FR-A-2,359,188 discloses 3-isothiazolone derivatives which
do not have a fused ring system in their structure.To control these adhering organisms, various antifouling agents such as
cuprous oxide have hitherto been used; however, their efficacy is not sufficient.In view of the above, it is the object of the invention
to provide methods of more effectively preventing and inhibiting
various organisms adhering to water-exposed articles.This object has been achieved by the surprising
finding that particular N-phenylbenzoisothiazolone
denvatives have an effect on the prevention and inhibition of adhesion of harmful
aquatic organisms, for example, harmful aquatic animals such as barnacles and sea
mussels; harmful aquatic plants such as algae and diatoms; and harmful aquatic objects
such as slime, thereby completing the present invention.  Thus, the present invention provides a controlling agent and an antifouling
coating against harmful aquatic organisms, which comprise an N-phenylbenzoisothiazolone
derivative of the formula:

wherein R's are the same or different and are independently halogen, C1-C10 alkyl or C1-C10 alkoxy; n is
an integer of 0 to 5; X's are the same or different and are independently halogen, nitro,
C1-C10 alkyl or C1-C10 alkoxy; and m is an integer of 0 to 4; with the proviso that when R's are all alkyl
or all alkoxy, n is an integer of 1 to 3, and when all of the R's are different, n is an integer
of 2 or 3.The present invention also provides a method for preventing and inhibiting
the adhesion of harmful
