<ABSTRACT>
A novel subfamily (PTP-D) of protein tyrosine phosphatases is identified. Included in this family are PTP-D proteins or glycoproteins having one, two, or three identified amino acid changes in previously defined consensus sequences in the catalytic phosphatase domains of known protein tyrosine phosphatases. The PTP-D proteins or glycoproteins may be produced by recombinant means. Antibodies to PTP-D proteins or glycoproteins and nucleic acid constructs coding therefor, and methods for screening molecules which can bind to PTP-D proteins or glycoproteins and inhibit or stimulate their enzymatic activity, are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the field of biochemistry and cell and
molecular biology. The invention relates to PTP-D proteins or glycoproteins
that are members of a novel subfamily (PTP-D) of protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPases), nucleic acid constructs coding for PTP-D proteins or
glycoproteins, recombinant expression vectors carrying the nucleic acid
constructs, cells containing the recombinant expression vectors, methods for
production and identification of PTP-D proteins and glycoproteins and DNA
constructs coding therefor, antibodies specific for PTP-D proteins and
glycoproteins, and methods for screening compounds capable of binding to and
inhibiting or stimulating protein tyrosine phosphatase enzymatic activity of
PTP-D proteins or glycoproteins.Phosphorylation of proteins is a fundamental mechanism for regulating
diverse cellular processes. While the majority of protein phosphorylation
occurs at serine and threonine residues, phosphorylation at tyrosine residues
is attracting a great deal of interest since the discovery that many oncogene
products and growth factor receptors possess intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase
activity. The importance of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in growth factor
signal transduction, cell cycle progression and neoplastic transformation is now
well established (Hunter et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 54:987-930 (1985),
Ultrich et al., Cell 61 :203-212 (1990), Nurse, Nature 344:503-508 (1990),
Cantley et al., Cell 64:281-302 (1991)).Biochemical studies have shown that phosphoryiation on tyrosine
residues of a variety of cellular proteins is a dynamic process involving
competing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. The regulation 
of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by the reciprocal actions of
protein tyrosine kinases (PTKases) and protein tyrosine phosphatases
(PTPases). The tyrosine phosphorylation reactions are catalyzed by PTKases.
Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins can be specifically dephosphorylated through
the action of PTPases. The level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of
intracellular substances is determined by the balance of PTKase and PTPase
activities. (Hunter, T., Cell 58:1013-1016 (1989)).The protein tyrosine kinases (PTKases) are a large family of proteins
that includes many growth factor receptors and potential oncogenes. (Hanks
et al., Science 241:42-52 (1988)). Many PTKases have been linked to initial
signals required for induction of the cell cycle (Weaver et al., Mol. and Cell.
Biol. 11(9):4415-4422 (1991)). PTKases comprise
