Chassis for a utility vehicle, especially for agricultural 
and forestry uses, encompassing a front frame (1) and a rear 

frame (2) joined to the former by articulation (3) with vertical 
swiveling axle (5), whereby two unconnected raising and 

lowering wheel units (6,9,10,11,14,17,18,19,22) are provided at 
the sides of the front and rear frames and an essentially 

centered support unit (25,41) is provided in each case, while 
these support units encompass support elements (28-36), each of 

which has a continuous surface equipped with cleats (36), 
characterized by the fact that each support unit encompasses a 

lift device (26,38), by means of which the associated support 
element can be both lowered and raised into a posztion, in 

which the continuous surface rolls on the ground, while the two 
lift devices are so dimensioned that they can together bear at 

least half of the total weight of the vehicle. 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that each support element encompasses a cleated roller (63). 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that each support element encompasses at least two rollers or 

wheels (30) with an encircling cleated track (32,33,36). 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that two position sensors are provided for detecting the transverse 

and the longitudinal cant of the chassis, which are 
connected with a position regulator, which controls the lift 

devices of the wheel units in such a way that the chassis is 
maintained in a horizontal position. 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that at least one bearing component is driven via a motor.  

 
Chassis according to Claim 5, characterized by the fact 
that both bearing components are driven via a motor and coupled 

with each other in such a way that the cleats (36) of both 
bearing components consecutively penetrate into the identical 

depressions in the soil while the vehicle is in motion. 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the cleats (36) are arranged on the bearing components in 

an exchangeable fashion. 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the height of the cleats may be adjusted, namely at least 

within the regions of the bearing components with which the 
cleats contact the ground. 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the rear of the rear frame is provided with a soil 

loosening device, the operating width of which essentially 
corresponds with the width of the bearing components. 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the wheel units are provided with bogie axles with wheels 

of different radii. 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that a front vehicle which is designed as the driving unit (T) 

is arranged on the front frame (1). 
Chassis according to Claim 11, characterized by the fact 
that the driving unit (T) is guided such that it may be moved 

independently on support arches (48) which are connected with 
the wheel swing arms (6) or the bearing swing arms (26) of the 

front frame (1). 
Chassis according to Claim 11, characterized by the fact 
that the front vehicle (1) is provided with a crane (K) having 

a harvester accessory, and that a rear vehicle which is provided  
 

with a timber transport device (47) is arranged on the rear 
frame (2), whereby the load of both utility devices is transferred 

directly onto the bearing components (25,41). 
Chassis according to Claim 13, characterized by the fact 
that the crane (K) braces itself on a load bridge (54) which is 

guided on support arches (48) that are arranged on the front 
bearing swing arms (26). 
Chassis according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that at least the upper bearing crossbeams (4Z) of the front or 

the rear frame (1;2) merge into bearing arches (43), the axes 
of curvature of which coincide with the pivoting axis (7;15) of 

the bearing swing arms (26) of the corresponding bearing unit 
(25,41), and that support arches (48) which rest on the bearing 

arches (43) are connected with the bearing unit swing arms (26) 
of the corresponding bearing units. 
Chassis according to Claim 10, characterized by the fact 
that the front ends of the rear wheel tie bars (17) are provided 

with guide plates (60) having webs (61), and that guide 
grooves (62) which accommodate and guide the webs are provided 

on the rear frame.
