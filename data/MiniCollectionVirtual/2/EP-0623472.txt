<ABSTRACT>
In the ink jet printing system described in the specification, 
a hot melt ink jet printhead (16) having two ink reservoirs (58,60) 

is coupled through an ink supply line to a remote hot 
melt ink supply and a temperature controller (22) is arranged to 

control the temperatures of the ink in the remote ink supply, 
the supply line, the ink reservoirs (58,60) in the printhead 

and passages leading from the reservoirs to the ink jet orifices 
at selected temperature levels to inhibit high-temperature 

degradation of the ink while permitting the ink to be 
jetted at the desired jetting temperature. In addition, a 

pressure control system (18) controls the pressure of the ink in 
the printhead (16) at one or more selected levels to permit the 

printhead (16) to be used at different orientations and to permit 
purging of air bubbles and contaminants from the orifice 

passageways and to supply a relatively 
high vacuum to a de-aerator (64) 

in the printhead to extract dissolved air from the 
ink. A check valve in the ink supply line permits the 

printhead to be positioned at different elevations with respect 
to the remote ink supply without causing any undesired 

flow of ink between the reservoir and the printhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink jet printing apparatus
and, more particularly, to a new and improved ink jet
printer having a printhead capable of ink jet printing in
different orientations and relative positions.Ink jet printing systems include a printhead having
small orifices through which ink is ejected in a
controlled manner to form an image on an adjacent
substrate. To counteract the effect of capillary action
in the small orifices which would otherwise cause ink to
seep out of the printhead when not in use but, at the
same time, prevent air from being drawn into the
printhead through the orifices, the ink in the printhead
must be maintained at a selected negative pressure which
is dependent upon the orifice size and the ink
characteristics and may be, for example, about 2 to 3
inches of water. In ink jet printing systems having a
remote ink supply connected to the printhead through a
supply line, however, the pressure of the ink in the
printhead can be affected by the relative vertical
positions of the printhead and the remote ink supply.
Moreover, many ink jet printers are designed to operate
only in one orientation of the printhead, which limits
the manner in which the ink jet system can be used.U.S. Patent No. 4651161 is concerned with the
problem of causing a "drop on demand" ink jet printer to
eject drops of constant volume despite changes in time
elapsing between successive actuation. A circuit is
provided which varies the pressure of writing fluid, such
as pigmented ink, supplied to the ink jet printer head in
response to timing pulses from a controller or other
device in which circuit the timing pulses are associated
with the instantaneous actuation frequency of the printer
head and correspond to the desired ink pressure at the
head required to eject ink drops of consistent volume. 
Ink is supplied to the ink jet head from a fluid chamber
having pressure producing means for changing the pressure
of the ink in the chamber and ink is fed to the chamber
under pressure from an ink source. A pressure sensor is
located between the fluid chamber and the ink jet head
and senses the pressure of ink at the head. The sensor
produces a signal representative of the sensed pressure
at the head and the sensed pressure is compared to the
desired pressure to produce a pressure modulating signal.
The pressure modulating signal is used to excite drive
means coupled to the fluid chamber pressure producing
means to vary the pressure of ink in the fluid chamber.
The fluid chamber ink pressure is related to the
