<ABSTRACT>
Colour display tube having a display screen with a pattern of phosphor 
elements. To reduce mislanding errors of the electron beams, particularly in the y-direction, 

the colour display tube is arranged within an external magnetic shield which 
is constituted by an open arrangement (frame) of bars of a soft-magnetic material. The 

bars jointly constitute, for example the ribs of a block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a colour display tube having an envelope and 
comprising means for generating electrons, a transparent display window, a display 
screen having a pattern of phosphor elements on the inner surface of the window and 
means for directing electrons onto the display screen. Such a colour display tube may be, for example of the box-shaped type or 
of the type in which the display window is connected by means of a funnel-shaped 
envelope portion having a neck portion accommodating the means for generating 
electrons, a colour selection means arranged opposite the display screen and an internal 
magnetic shield arranged within the funnel-shaped portion and having two long side 
walls parallel to the long axis of the display screen (the x-axis), two short side walls 
parallel to the short axis of the display screen (the y-axis), and a gun-sided open end 
which extends transversely to the longitudinal axis of the display tube. A colour selection means is herein understood to mean, for example, an 
apertured shadow mask sheet or a wire mask. In a colour display tube the earth's magnetic field deflects the electron 
paths, which without any measures may be so large that the electrons impinge upon the 
wrong phosphor element (mislanding) and produce a discolouration of the picture. 
Particularly the component of the earth's magnetic field in the axial direction of the 
display tube (referred to as the axial field) plays an important role in this respect, which 
may become manifest as a lack of colour or even as a colour impurity in the corners of 
the display screen. A known measure of reducing mislandings due to the earth's magnetic 
field is the use of an internal magnetic shield which, together with the similarly 
ferromagnetic shadow mask, partially shields the earth's magnetic field. The shape of 
such a shield roughly follows the contours of the envelope of the display tube. This 
means that the funnel-shaped shield has two long, trapezoidal sides which are parallel  
 
to the long axis (the x-axis) of the display screen and two short, trapezoidal sides which 
are parallel to the short axis (the y-axis) of the display screen. The short sides of the shield are often provided from the gun-sided 
aperture (17, Fig. 3) with triangular recesses (18, 19, Fig. 3) so as to reduce 
mislanding in the corners due to the axial field. If relatively small tubes and a relatively 
large pitch of the elements of the phosphor pattern on the display screen are used, an 
acceptable result may be achieved
