<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an oscillator with first frequency-determining elements provided for a first frequency of oscillation. To create, particularly for use in video signal processing, an oscillator which can be switched and tuned to at least two frequencies of oscillation, at least a second frequency-determining element is provided which can be added to the first frequency-determining element for setting the oscillator to a second frequency of oscillation.

An oscillator having first frequency-determining elements provided for a

first oscillation frequency and at least a second frequency-determining element which
can be connected to the first frequency-determining elements for adjusting the oscillator

to a second oscillation frequency, characterized by an amplifier element whose gain
factor, jointly with the connection of at least one of the second frequency-determining

elements, is switchable and via which an adjusting signal can be applied to the first
frequency-determining elements.
An oscillator as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the first
frequency-determining element comprises a first capacitance which can be connected in

parallel with a second capacitance as the second frequency-determining element.
An oscillator as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the second
frequency-determining element can be connected via at least a switching diode.
An oscillator as claimed in claim 3, characterized by a supply circuit
which comprises at least a controllable current source by which the switching diode is

fed and which is optionally switchable between the conducting or the blocked state.
An oscillator as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that the supply circuit
comprises a (first) driver stage for controlling the controllable current source(s).
An oscillator as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the supply
circuit comprises a device for tuning the second frequency-determining element.
An oscillator as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the second
frequency-determining element comprises at least a capacitance diode and the device for

tuning the second frequency-determining element comprises a second driver stage for 
generating a bias voltage for this capacitance diode.
An oscillator as claimed in claim 7, where appendant to claim 5,
characterized in that the driver stages comprise a differential amplifier each, in that the

differential amplifiers are controlled by a common control signal at one of their inputs
and in that their second inputs receive threshold values of different levels which are

dimensioned in such a way that the threshold value applied to the first driver stage
limits a control range of the second driver stage fixed by the threshold value applied to

the second driver stage.
An oscillator as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the gain factor
for each of the oscillation frequencies is chosen to be such that adjusting characteristics

having at least substantially corresponding slopes result for the adjustment of the
oscillator to all adjustable oscillation frequencies by the adjusting signal.
