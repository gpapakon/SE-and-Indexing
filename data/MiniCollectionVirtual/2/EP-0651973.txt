<ABSTRACT>
A surgical router for cutting anatomical tissue includes an 
outer tubular member (12) and an inner member (14) 

rotatably disposed in said 
outer member and having a pair of router blades (70) disposed distally 

of a distal end of the outer member and equally spaced about a 
longitudinal axis of the inner member and a pair of flutes (72) disposed 

between the router blades. The flutes have bottoms (74) and sides (76) 
transverse to the flute bottoms, with the flute bottoms angularly 

intersecting a passage (62) in the inner member to form aspiration ports 
(104) within and integral with the flutes. The router blades have 

leading walls (80), trailing walls (82) and clearance walls (86) 
with a width 

between the trailing walls that is tapered in a distal direction. 
The leading walls correspond to the flute sides and are curved 

about the inner member axis in the direction of rotation of the 
inner member in the outer member. End and side cutting edges are 

disposed along the leading walls with the end cutting edges being 
curved about the inner member axis in accordance with the curvature 

of the leading walls, and the side cutting edges extending 
longitudinally, helically along the inner member. Center cutting 

surfaces join the clearance walls and the leading walls at notches (98) 
at the inner member distal end, and the junctures of the center 

cutting surfaces with the clearance walls define center cutting 
edges angled from the end cutting edges in the direction of 

rotation of the inner member in the outer member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical cutting instruments
and, more particularly, to surgical routers having cutting blades
for cutting anatomical tissue, aspiration ports for aspirating
tissue cut by the cutting blades and flutes for carrying cut tissue
toward the aspiration ports.Surgical instruments for cutting various types of anatomical
tissue have become extremely popular for use in many surgical
procedures and, particularly, in joint surgery such as surgery of
the knee and shoulder. Surgical cutting instruments for cutting
anatomical tissue have been designed with cutting blades to perform
various diverse cutting functions, such as resection, shaving and
abrading, on various diverse types of anatomical tissue, such as
bone and cartilage. GB 2 234 906-A- concerns a nuclectomy instrument
for the removal of nuclear material from an intervertebral disc.
The instrument comprises a tube with blades at the distal end to
engage the nuclear material and deposit it in the tube for removal
by a source of suction. 
Such surgical cutting instruments have also
been designed with flutes to facilitate cutting by the cutting
blades and with suction holes to aspirate tissue cut by the cutting
blades via the surgical cutting instrument. One of the
disadvantages of many presently available fluted surgical cutting
instruments is that the structure and arrangement of the cutting
blades and flutes with respect to one another fail to produce
aggressive cutting and efficient resecting action in diverse types
of anatomical tissue. Other disadvantages of fluted surgical 
cutting instruments are that the geometry of flutes and/or
aspiration ports is not capable of accommodating relatively large
quantities of tissue cut by the cutting blades and is not effective
in carrying the cut tissue toward the suction holes, such that the
instrument can become clogged during use. An additional drawback
of many fluted surgical cutting instruments is that the suction
holes are located away from the flutes with the result that the cut
tissue can build up and clog the instrument prior to reaching the
suction holes. Clogging of the surgical cutting instruments during
use is highly undesirable in that impairment and/or interruption of
surgical procedures, as well as damage to the cutting instruments,
can result. In this regard, clogging of the surgical cutting
instruments is particularly disadvantageous in endoscopic or closed
surgery arthroscopic procedures. An additional disadvantage of
such prior art instruments is that the surgical
