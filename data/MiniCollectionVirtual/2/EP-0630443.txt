<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a so called unit injector for supplying fuel to a 
combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, and of the kind 
comprising a body part to which is secured a fuel injection nozzle which 
defines an outlet orifice, a pumping plunger slidable within a bore in the 
body part, the plunger extending from one end of the bore and being 
movable inwardly into the bore to displace fuel from the bore to the 
injection nozzle, by an engine driven cam and a valve operable to 
control the amount of fuel delivered through the nozzle. GB-A-2131873 discloses a unit injector of the aforesaid kind in which 
the longitudinal axis of the pumping plunger extends more or less at 
right angles to the axis of the fuel injection nozzle. The axial force 
which is applied to the plunger to achieve delivery of fuel through the 
injection nozzle is resisted by the fact that the main structure of the unit 
injector is secured to and partly in the cylinder head of the associated 
engine. The object of the invention is to provide a unit injector of the kind 
specified in a simple and convenient form in which the axial force 
applied to the pumping plunger to achieve fuel delivery is substantially 
balanced. According to the invention in a unit injector of the kind specified an 
additional plunger is provided, the additional plunger being slidable 
within and extending from the other end of the bore for actuation by a 
further engine driven cam.  
 An example of a unit injector in accordance with the invention will now 
be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- 
Figure 1 is a side elevation of the unit injector, Figure 2 is a view taken at right angles to Figure 1, and Figures 3 and 4 are views similar to Figure 1 showing modifications. Referring to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, the unit injector comprises 
a body part 10 from which extends a cylindrical screw threaded 
extension 11. Located in sealing engagement against the end face ot the 
extension 11 is one end of a cylindrical distance member 12 against the 
other end of which is located in sealing relationship, a distance piece 
13A against which is located a fuel injection nozzle 13. The injection 
nozzle body, the distance piece 13A, the distance member 12 and the 
extension 11 are held in assembled relationship by means of a cap nut 
14. The fuel injection nozzle 13 includes the nozzle body and a valve 
member (not shown) which is slidable within the nozzle body in known 
manner. The valve member defines an annular

<CLAIMS>
A unit injector for supplying fuel to a combustion chamber of 
an internal combustion engine comprising a body part (10) to which is 

secured a fuel injection nozzle (13, 53) which defines an outlet orifice, a 
pumping plunger (22) slidable within a bore (21) in the body part, the 

plunger (22) extending from one end of the bore and being movable 
inwardly into the bore to displace fuel from the bore to the fuel injection 

nozzle, by an engine driven cam (26, 50) and a valve (35) operable to 
control the amount of fuel delivered through the nozzle characterised by 

an additional plunger (22) slidable within and extending from the other 
end of the bore (21) for actuation by a further engine driven cam (26, 

50). 
A unit injector according to Claim 1 characterised by hollow 
guide sleeves (24) formed integrally with the body part (10), a pair of 

tappets (23) slidable within the sleeves respectively, said tappets carrying 
rollers (25) respectively for engagement with the engine driven cams, 

means coupling the outer ends of the plungers to the tappets respectively 
and spring means (27) for biasing the tappets and plungers outwardly. 
A unit injector according to Claim 2 including means (29,30) for 
limiting the extent of outward movement of the tappets. 
A unit injector according to Claim 1 in which the injection 
nozzle (13, 53) is secured to an extension (75) of the body part (10) 

characterised in that the extension is formed in two parts (76, 77) with 
one part (76) being integral with the body part (10) and the other part  

 
(77) having the injection nozzle mounted thereon, passage means 

extending between the two parts, said passage means acting to convev 
fuel from the bore (21) to the injection nozzle, and resilient means (82) 

acting between the parts whereby when the body part (10) is clamped to 
the cylinder head of the engine the resilient means (82) will yield and 

impose an axial thrust on the other part (77) thereby to establish a gas 
seal between a part (84) associated with the fuel injection nozzle and a 

surface defined by the cylinder head.  
 
A unit injector according to Claim 4 characterised by a recess 
(78) formed in the one part (76) and a spigot (81) defined by the other 

part (77), which locates in said recess to allow the rocking movement 
between the parts, and means (79) acting to prevent separation of the 

two parts whilst allowing said rocking movement. 
A unit injector according to Claim 5 characterised in that said 
resilient means comprises a stack (82) of Belleville washers which are 

located about said spigot (81). 
An internal combustion engine including a cylinder head in 
which is defined a plurality of bores opening into the combustion 

chambers of the engine respectively, a pair of engine driven cam shafts 
mounted on the cylinder head for actuating the inlet and exhaust valves 

of the engine, and unit fuel injectors mounted in said bores respectively, 
characterised in that each unit injector is constructed in accordance with 

Claim 1. 
A unit injector according to Claim 1 in which the body part (10) 

is of generally cylindrical form with the fuel injection nozzle (13, 53) 
being secured at one end thereof characterised in that the bore (21)  

 
extends transversely to the longitudinal axis of the body part (10) 

intermediate the ends of the body part. 
A unit injector according to Claim 8 characterised in that the 
valve (35) is located at the other end of the body part (10). 
A unit injector according to Claim 9 characterised in that the 
body part (10) defines integral hollow guide sleeves (24) which surround 

in spaced relationship, the extending portions of the plungers (22), said 
guide sleeves having tappets (23) slidable therein and which are coupled 

to the plungers respectively, the tappets carrying rollers (25) for 
engagement with the engine driven cams (26).
