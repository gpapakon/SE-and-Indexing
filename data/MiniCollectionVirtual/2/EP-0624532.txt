<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for sorting bottles, having at least one two-track sorting region (3) which is followed in a direction of transport, in alignment with the two tracks, at least two respective transport regions (4-6) for discharging the sorted bottles (2). There are provided on an auxiliary transport apparatus (11a, 11b) push-over elements (25) having headpieces, by means of which, during sorting, the bottles can be pushed respectively over onto a track of the sorting region corresponding to the type of bottle. The push-over elements (25) form a first and a second group of such elements, in such a way that these groups are located opposite one another in respect of their headpieces (30) transversely relative to the direction of transport (A), during the pushing-over of a bottle (2) the latter being arranged between mutually opposite and equidirectionally moved headpieces (30) of at least one push-over element of the first group and one push-over element of the second group.
