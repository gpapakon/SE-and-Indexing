<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catheter needle
having surface indication thereon.Intravenous catheters come substantially in two types of
products. The first type is a through-the-needle catheter
product wherein the catheter that is to be disposed within
the vein is inserted through a sharpened cannula and the
cannula is used to pierce the skin and insert the catheter
and later is removed. However, this type of catheter has
not met with much commercial success do to inherent flaws
in the through-the-needle type delivery system. For
example, the needle must be larger in diameter than the
catheter being inserted. Therefore, the needle creates a
larger opening on insertion than the catheter requires and
creates a greater chance of leakage. Furthermore, it is
difficult to remove and dispose of the needle or cannula
once the catheter has been inserted.The second and more common type of intravenous catheters
is the over-the-needle catheter. In this type of product
a needle or cannula has disposed thereover a catheter.
The catheter is disposed such that the sharpened tip of
the needle is extending from the catheter product and is
used to pierce the patient's skin and insert the catheter.
Once the skin and vein have been pierced, the catheter is
threaded off of the needle and the needle is removed from 
the catheter product.In order to ease the insertion of the over-the-needle type
catheter products, it has long been known to bevel the tip
of the catheter to provide a smooth transition between the
surface or outer diameter of the needle or cannula and the
surface or outer diameter of the catheter itself during
the insertion process. There have been many methods
developed for beveling the tips of catheters. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,661,300 to Daugherty entitled
"Method and Apparatus for Flashless Tipping of an I.V.
Catheter" discloses a process which was used in the early
1980's to mold a beveled tip on a catheter while
simultaneously trimming the flash in order to provide a
clean edge to the tip. This process, however, requires a
high cost in retooling because of the wear interface
between the two tool members and the cleaning necessary to
unclog the mold from the trimmed flash.Catheters have also been provided with what is actually a
duel bevel. The bevel begins gently at approximately 3°
and then is sharper right at the tip, for example 27°. The
sharper bevel is provided to ease the transition to the
initial OD of the catheter, while the softer bevel eases
the opening to the final OD of the

<CLAIMS>
A catheter assembly (1, 3) comprising:

an insertion needle (1) having a sharpened point (2) and a
passage defined therein;
a catheter (3) having a hub and a distal portion (5) of tubular
material disposed over said needle (1) and ending in a distal

tip (4);

characterized in that
said needle (1) has a first surface
portion having a finish of a first visual

quality over a major portion thereof and a second visual
characteristic (7) immediately adjacent the distal tip (4) of said

catheter (3) indicating the tip of the catheter on the surface
of the needle.
The catheter assembly of claim 1 wherein said second
portion (7) is approximately 1 mm wide.
The catheter assembly of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said
second visual portion (7) is a modified surface finish which is

more reflective than the remainder of the surface finish of
the needle (1).
The catheter assembly of claim 3 wherein said second
portion (7) is formed of a higher concentration of chromium at

the surface of said second portion (7) than is present at the
surface of the remaining portion of said needle (1).
The catheter assembly of claim 3 wherein the needle (1) has
an at least partially oxidized outer layer and said second

portion (7) is defined by removal of said oxidized outer layer
of said needle (1).
The catheter assembly of any one of claims 1 to 5
wherein the catheter (3) is made of a substantially optically

clear material.
The catheter assembly of any one of claims 1 to 6
wherein the tubular material of said catheter (3) is

polyurethane.
