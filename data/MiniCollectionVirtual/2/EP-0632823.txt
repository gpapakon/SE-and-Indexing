A liquid cleaner for hard surfaces based on preferably 
aqueous solutions of surfactants, detergency boosters, 

optionally builders, water-soluble solvents or solubilizers 
and other typical constituents of such cleaners, 

characterized in that it contains 0.001 to 0.2 % by weight of 
practically uncrosslinked copolymers of 80 to 20 and 

preferably 60 to 40 % by weight of esters of acrylic and/or 
methacrylic acid containing 1 to 4 and more particularly 1 to 

2 carbon atoms in the alcohol component and b) 20 to 80 and 
preferably 40 to 60 % by weight of acrylic acid and/or 

methacrylic acid with an intrinsic viscosity [η] of ≥ 400 ml 

g
-1
, as determined in THF at 20 °C, as the detergency 
booster with the proviso that the ratio of surfactants to 

polymers is at least 10:1. 
A cleaner as claimed in claims 1 to 2, characterized in that 
the copolymers consist of 55 % by weight of ethyl acrylate, 

35 % by weight of methacrylic acid and 10 % by weight of 
acrylic acid and have an intrinsic viscosity [η]
 of ≥ 200 and 
preferably ≥ 400 ml ·g
-1
, as determined in THF at 20 °C. 
A cleaner as claimed in claims 1 to 2, characterized in that 
it contains 0.05 to 40 % by weight and preferably 5 to 30 % 

weight of surfactants and surfactant mixtures, 0 to 10 % by 
weight and preferably 1 to 6 % by weight of organic and/or 

inorganic builders, 0.001 to 0.2 % by weight of detergency 
boosters and up to a total of 100 % by weight, based on the 

total weight, of other typical constituents and quantities of 
such cleaners and water.
