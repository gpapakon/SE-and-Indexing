<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a sheet sorting 
and containing apparatus for conveying thin sheets or 

thick sheets to a plurality of containing portions and 
for sorting such sheets into the containing portions. 

The apparatus comprises a first path for distributing 
the thin sheet to the containing portion, and a second 

path for distributing the thick sheet to the containing 
portion. The first path or second path is selected in 

accordance with a thickness of the sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet sorting 
and containing apparatus, and more particularly, it 
relates to a sheet sorting and containing apparatus 
connected to a copying machine having a reading 
apparatus, a facsimile machine (communication system) 
or a printer as a terminal device for a computer, or 
connected to a stapling device (stapler or bonding 
device) to sort and contain sheets outputted from such 
a copying machine and the like, and also relates to an 
image forming apparatus having such a sheet sorting and 
containing apparatus. In the past, as sheet sorting and containing 
techniques for sorting sheets discharged from an image 
forming apparatus and for containing the sorted sheets 
in containing portions such as trays, there have been 
proposed sheet sorting and containing apparatuses 
wherein the discharged sheets are lifted or lowered by 
means of an ascent/descent convey device to introduce 
the sheets to desired trays or sheet sorting and 
containing apparatuses wherein the discharged sheets 
are directed to desired trays through a plurality of 
branch paths disposed at heights of the respective trays.  
 However, among the above-mentioned conventional 
apparatus, in the sheet sorting and containing 
apparatuses for sorting the sheet only by the 
ascent/descent convey device, when the sheets are 
continuously discharged from the image forming apparatus, 
the ascent/descent convey device must catch the 
preceding sheet and be lifted to send the sheet to 
the desired tray and then must be lowered to the 
initial position until the next sheet is discharged. 
Accordingly, the ascent/descent convey device must be 
operated at very high speed, it is practically 
impossible. On the other hand, in the sheet sorting and 
containing apparatuses for sorting the sheet only by 
the convey vertical path (branch paths), in order to 
change a direction of a sheet bundle having a thickness 
greater than a predetermined thickness by a branching 
means, the sheet bundle must be passed through a 
reverse rotation path having great radius of curvature. 
Thus, since the installation space for the branching 
means is greatly increased, the entire apparatus 
becomes bulky, thereby reducing the space utilizing 
efficiency. The present invention aims to eliminate the 
above-mentioned conventional drawbacks, and has an  
 
object of the present invention to provide a sheet 
sorting and containing apparatus which can sort various 
sheets and sheet bundles (single sheet having a thickness 
smaller than a
