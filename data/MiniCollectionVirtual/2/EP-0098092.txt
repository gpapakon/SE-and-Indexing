<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a succession of lithographically-­
printed self-adhesive labels (32) on a length of release 

backing material (16), which method comprises the steps of:
 

(a) producing by lithographic printing a plurality of 
sheets (4) carrying a desired image,

 
(b) adhering each of the lithographically-printed sheets 

(4) successively to a support web (6) comprising a self-­
adhesive backed material (14) carried on a release material 

(16), the printed sheets (4) being adhered to the upper 
surface of the adhesive backed material (14),

 
(c) cutting through the adhered lithographic sheets (4) 

and through the adhesive-backed material (14) as far as the 
release material (16) thereby to form the required labels (32), 

and
 

(d) removing the unwanted portions (28) of the printed 
sheets (4) and the adhesive-backed material (14) adhered 

thereto from the release material (16).
