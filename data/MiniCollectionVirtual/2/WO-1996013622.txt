<ABSTRACT>
A method of improving the oxidation resistance of a platinum modified aluminide coating formed on a nickel base superalloy substrate, comprises providing a platinum layer on the substrate, heating the substrate in a coating retort to a temperature of at least about 1000  DEG C, forming external of the coating retort a high purity coating gas comprising hydrogen and aluminum trichloride, and introducing the coating gas into the coating retort to contact the heated substrate to form an outwardly grown, single phase [(Ni,Pt)Al] platinum modified aluminide coating having reduced concentration of at least one of a substrate substitutional alloying element and a surface active tramp element selected from at least one of B, P, and S in said coating as compared to a platinum modified aluminide coating formed at a lower temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PLATINUM ALUMINIDE CVD COATING METHODFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an outwardly grown, single phase (Ni,Pt)Al platinum modified aluminide coating produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) under selected conditions effective to substantially reduce the concentration of substrate substitutional alloying elements, such as W, Mo, etc., and surface active tramp elements, such as B, P, and S, in the coating and thereby improve coating high temperature oxidation resistance. The outward growth coating method can be used in the repair of engine run components, such as turbine blades.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION At temperatures greater than about 1000째C (1832째F) , high temperature oxidation is the most important form of environmental attack observed with aluminide diffusion coatings. High temperature oxidation is a chemical reaction whose rate controlling process for an aluminide coating is the diffusion of aluminum through a product (oxide) layer. Diffusion is a thermally activated process, and consequently, the diffusion coefficients are exponential functions of temperature. Since the oxidation of aluminide coatings is a diffusion controlled reaction and diffusion coefficients are exponential functions of temperature, the oxidation rate is also an exponential function of temperature. At low temperatures where diffusion coefficients are relatively small, the growth rate of a protective scale on any aluminide coating is also small. Thus, adequate oxidation resistance should be provided by any state of the art aluminide coatings, such as: chromium aluminide, aluminide or two phase [PtAl2 + (Ni,Pt)Al] platinum aluminide, all inward grown coatings made by pack cementation. However, at high temperatures where the diffusion coefficients and 

consequently the oxidation rate increase rapidly with increasin temperature, only coatings which form high purity alumina (A1203) scales are likely to provide adequate resistance to environmental degradation. This point is clearly illustrated by the cyclic oxidation test results from three state of the art aluminide coatings (designated MDC-51, MDC-351 and LDC-2E by the Assignee, Howmet Corporation) on IN-100 substrates provided in Figure 1. The observed variations in life of coatings with the same initial thickness is the result of differences in the growth rate and/or adherence of the protective oxide scale. Specifically, the dissolution of substitutional substrate alloying elements into the aluminide coating and consequently the alumina scale can
