<ABSTRACT>
Method for generating an FDM signal with a high channel number for transmission purposes in radio and television distribution systems. The channel signals which are sampled at a uniform sampling rate and digitised are respectively frequency-converted in interpolating digital frequency converters with an increase in the sampling rate and are combined to form the FDM signal. The frequency-converted signals are signals which have complex values and are combined by means of a complex adder and subjected to frequency conversion in a second stage by means of filters having coefficients with complex values, the sampling rate being further raised, and are converted into real signals which are combined to form the FDM signal by means of a real adder. The method is characterised in that for the purpose of separating the individual channel signals or channel bundle signals from the FDM signal, the method steps applied to condition said signal are subjected to a Hermite transposition and applied. Use in a radio and television distribution system, in particular in the case of optical fibres, which permits a high channel number and a local exchange of programmes in conjunction with high flexibility and reconfigurability at arbitrary points by means of inexpensive single-channel bandpass filters.
