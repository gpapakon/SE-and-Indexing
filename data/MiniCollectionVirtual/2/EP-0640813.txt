<ABSTRACT>
The load cell has an outer bearing ring (LR) and an inner force introduction tube (KR), which are mutually connected via a disc-shaped ring bar (RS). According to the invention, an outer surface (US) of the ring bar has an outer and an inner ring groove (AK, IK). On the other, flat outer surface (OS) of the disc-shaped ring bar (RS), strain gauges (DMS11, DMS12; DMS21, DMS22) are attached as directly as possible above the outer and inner ring grooves (AK, IK) lying under them. The conductor tracks (LB) of the strain gauges extend in the radial direction in this arrangement. The invention has the advantage that a respectively desired nominal load range of the load cell can be set in a simple manner via the groove depth (T) of the outer and inner ring grooves (AK, IK), without the geometrical dimensions of the load cell having to be changed for this purpose.

<CLAIMS>
Load cell having an outer bearing ring (LR) 
and an inner force-introduction tube (KR) which are 

connected together by way of a disc-shaped ring bar 
(RS), wherein 


a) the one outer face (US) of the disc-shaped ring 
bar (RS) has an outer and an inner ring notch (AK, 

IK), and 
b) on the other outer face (OS) of the disc-shaped 
ring bar (RS) strain gauges (DMS11,DMS12;DMS21, 

DMS22) are provided as directly as possible above 
the outer and the inner ring notch (AK, IK) which 

lie underneath on the one outer face (US), in 
which case the printed conductors (LB) of the 

strain gauges extend radially. 
Load cell according to claim 1, having a cover 
disc (AS) for sealing the outer face (OS) of the disc-shaped 

ring bar (RS) which bears the strain gauges 
(DMS11,DMS12; DMS21,DMS22). 
Load cell according to claim 1 or 2, having a 
support ring (AR) at the inner edge of the outside (AU) 

of the outer bearing ring (LR) that lies opposite an 
external support face (AF).
