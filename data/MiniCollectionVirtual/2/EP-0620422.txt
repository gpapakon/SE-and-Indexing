<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for the gravimetric metering and mixing of at least two components (K1, K2), in which the weight components of the components (K1, K2) are detected by weighing and both components (K1, K2) are mixed with each other in a container (21). In order to provide a method and a device with which it is possible to mix together even components which are difficult to mix uniformly with accurate metering and without excessively long mixing processes, it is proposed according to the invention that a first component (K1) is put into a first weighing container (11), that a second component is supplied continuously into a second weighing container (21) during a predeterminable period, while the first component (K1) is transferred out of the first weighing container (11) continuously into the second weighing container (21), at least partially simultaneously in sections, the second weighing container (21) receiving the sum of the weights of the first and the second components (K1, K2), the relative proportions of the first and second components (K1, K2) resulting in the second weighing container (21) from the removal of weight of the content of the first weighing container (11) and the sum of the weights of the two components (K1, K2) in the second weighing container (21), two weighing containers (11, 21) being correspondingly provided for the device, one of which weighing containers being provided with a delivery device (13) which feeds the component (K1) from the first weighing container to the other weighing container (21) and being designed as a metering device, the further supply device (25) for the second weighing container (21) also being designed as a metering device.
