<ABSTRACT>
Radiation-emitting semiconductor diodes are used as laser diodes or LEDs 

inter alia
 in optical disc systems, laser printers and bar code readers. The emission 
wavelength in these cases lies preferably in the visible range of the spectrum. Known 

diodes have an active layer (3A) and cladding layers (2,4) which comprise either 
AlGaAs or InAlGaP. These known diodes have the disadvantage that they do not cover 

a portion of the visible spectrum between 880 and 600 nm. 
A diode according to the invention is characterized in that the active layer 
(3A) comprises 

Al
x
Ga
1-x
As and the cladding layers (2,4) comprise

P, while 
the active layer (3A) has such an aluminium content (x) and such a thickness (d) that the 

wavelength of the photoluminescence emission lies between approximately 770 and 690 
nm. This results in the availability of (laser) diodes covering the entire spectrum from 

approximately 880 nm to 600 nm which operate satisfactorily, supply a high power, and 
are easy to manufacture. Preferably, the active layer comprises a (multiple) quantum 

well structure of alternating quantum well layers and barrier layers, both comprising 
AlGaAs, but with different aluminium contents. The active layer can also 

comprise AlGaAsP.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radiation-emitting semiconductor diode, often
referred to as diode for short hereinafter, comprising a semiconductor body with a
semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type on which a semiconductor layer
structure is present which comprises in that order at least a first cladding layer of the
first conductivity type, an active layer which emits in the visible range of the spectrum,
and a second cladding layer of a second conductivity type opposite to the first, while the
first and the second cladding layer are provided with means for electrical connection.Such radiation-emitting diodes, in particular when constructed as lasers
and when the emission wavelength lies in the visible range of the spectrum, form
suitable radiation sources for various applications: radiation sources in optical disc
systems, pumping lasers for solid state lasers, or radiation sources in some medical -
analytical or therapeutic - applications where a high-energy source with a substantially
linear spectrum is desired. There are also many applications for diodes of the LED
type.Such a radiation-emitting diode is known from "Semiconductor Lasers and
Heterojunction LEDs" by H. Kressel and J. Butler, Academic Press 1977, pp. 505-506.
The diode described therein comprises a GaAs substrate on which is provided an active
layer of AlGaAs interposed between AlGaAs cladding layers. As shown in the Figure
on page 505 of the above book, such a diode, depending on the aluminium content in
the active layer, covers the range of the visible spectrum above a photoluminescence
wavelength of approximately 770 nm, corresponding to a laser emission wavelength of
approximately 780 nm. No satisfactorily operating diodes can be realised below this
wavelength owing to a loss of confinement. Diodes with an active layer of InAlGaP
enclosed between InAlGaP cladding layers have been known for a number of years
besides the diodes on a GaAs substrate mentioned above, for example, from the article
by H. Hamada et al., IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. 27, no. 6, 1991, pp.
1483-1490. The emission wavelength realised by such diodes varies from approximately
680 nm to approximately 600 nm. When the active layer comprises InGaP (aluminium 
content = 0), and when a compressive stress is applied thereto (indium content > 50
at. %), the emission wavelength can be increased to approximately 690 nm,
corresponding to a laser emission at approximately 700 nm.A disadvantage of the known diodes is that a portion of the range of
