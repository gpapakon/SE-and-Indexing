<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the analysis of individual particle characteristics from an aerosol or other suspension of particles includes: a scattering chamber (15) including an ellipsoidal reflector (17) having an orifice therein leading to a rear chamber (20); a monochromatic light source (10) adapted to transmit a collimated beam of light (11) along the main axis of the reflector (17); means (26, 27) for directing a stream of the particles through the beam of light (11) as substantially the main focus (60) of the reflector (17); a ccd video recorder (36) having a two dimensional array of a multitude of sensors arranged to image light scattered from a particle in the stream of particles; an optical system (17, 32, 33, 34) arranged to collect the scattered light from a solid angle of at least 3. around the region where the particle stream crosses the light beam (11); and a data processor (37). The detector (36) is associated with an imaging screen (35) positioned such that rays of light scattered from the particle and imaged thereon by the optical system (17, 32, 33, 34) are monotonically ordered with respect to the angle of scattering of the rays from the particle, the rear chamber (20) contains sensor means (25) for sensing scattered light not collected by the optical means (17, 32, 33, 34) and thereby determining the presence of a particle in the beam of light (11), the means (25) forming part of a trigger for triggering the video camera (36) to store an image associated with the particle, and the data processor (37) is adapted to compare parameters of the image with parameters stored in a memory to determine the nature of the particle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Analysis of particle characteristicsThe ability to measure particles by shape and size is of importance to many groups of people. The food and chemical industries are concerned from a quality control point of view; biologists are interested in characterising cells and monitoring changes in and differences between cells; environmental scientists are concerned with airborne particles and their effect on air quality and health. This list is by no means exhaustive, it is merely intended to illustrate the driving force behind the attempts to develop accurate and reliable measurement instrumentation, and to theoretically understand the nature of the problem.There are currently two main optical scattering methods in use in commercially available particle measurement systems. The first method attempts to size particles by measuring their static or dynamic behaviour in fluid. These systems generally measure deposition rate, acceleration in a jet stream, or Brownian motion. The second method attempts to size particles by measuring the light scattered from an illuminated particle or ensemble of particles either at a few specific angles or over a large solid angular range. Apart from image analysis systems, none of the commercial instruments is capable of characterising particles by shape, non-spherical particles being sized by assigning an equivalent spherical diameter, although this diameter depends on the measurement method used. What is worse, is that some instruments are known to become inaccurate when tested with non-spherical particles of regular shape, so measurements taken with particles of arbitrary shape have to be treated with some caution. Instruments which attempt a shape classification are based on image analysis, which requires taking an image of a small number of particles and performing complex image processing. The particle sample has to be prepared beforehand so that it is in a form suitable for image processing, i.e. it has to be processed so that individual particles can be seen with minimal overlapping. Thus there is a considerable time delay before the results are available. The method also requires fast computers in order to do the analysis reasonably quickly. Some of the other instruments also suffer a time delay 

before measurements are available, and whether this is important depends on the application. It is not necessarily important for batch testing powders for example, but it is of potential importance when monitoring a working environment for asbestos fibres or
