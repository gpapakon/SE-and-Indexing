<DESCRIPTION>
USE OF MMP TNHTBTTOKSThis application relates to the novel use of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitors for inhibition of angiogenesis and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. This causes, inter alia , regression of tumours and is useful in the treatment of cancer.Growth of tumours occurs both by local/regional spread and by a process of dissemination from the primary lesion known as metastasis, which gives rise to multiple secondary lesions that render the cancer unresectable.Patients with inoperable cancer include those with primary lesions with poorly defined margins and those with widespread metastatic disease. These patients cannot be cured by the currently available therapies. Such patients include those with breast, lung or colorectal carcinoma, and, for them, the prognosis remains poor(pain, decline in performance status and ultimately death) , due to the inability to treat effectively disseminated forms of these cancers.A major problem with the prior art is that most methods of treatment which are designed, to kill disseminated cancer cells are highly toxic to normal (non-cancer) cells. and can therefore only be administered for limited periods of time. A very desirable goal in cancer treatment is "therefore to be able to produce necrosis of the tumour cells without toxic side effects, and thus prolong survival of the patient.It has now surprisingly been discovered that various matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, such as inhibitors of collagenases, stromelysins and gelatinases, may be effective in bringing about tumour regression. Many 

compounds are known which are active as matrix metalloprotease inhibitors and which are not believed to be cytotoxic and the use of such compounds may therefore provide a breakthrough in cancer therapy, and in the treatment of diseases where angiogenesis is important , such as diabetic retinopathy, pterygia, psoriasis and atherosclerosis .Although it might be possible to use endogenous MMP inhibitors in this manner, there is a problem associated with their large size (Mr 20-30kD) which excludes them from microenvironments within the tumour and thus limits their practical use . Further, endogenous MMP inhibitors such as TIMP 2 may also act as cytokines (Docherty et al . f Nature 318 66-69 (1985 ) , giving rise to non¬ specific side effects .The present invention therefore concerns a method of management of cancer in mammals , in particular humans, the method comprising administering to the mammal an effect ive amount of a non-endogenou s matrix
