<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition 
containing a compound which exhibits antioncogenic 
promoter activity by inhibiting Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
expression in EBV latent infected human lymphoblastoid 
cells. Recently, as a short-term detection method of 
an oncogenic promotor, an assay using Epstein-Barr virus 
expression as an index has been established by Ito et al 
(Cancer Letter, 13, 29-37(1981)). Using this assay 
system, it is possible to conduct screening for an 
antioncogenic promoter activity by detecting induction of 
EBV EA (early antigen of Epstein-Barr virus) induced by 
tumor promoter such as TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) 
or teleocidin B in EBV latent infected human 
lymphoblastoid cells. Inhibitor of Epstein-Barr virus 
expression may be extremely useful as antioncogenic 
promoter (see Ito et al., Cancer Letter 13, 29-37 
(1981)). In addition, using this assay system, 
inhibitory action against the expression of Epstein-Barr 
virus of flavonoides and triterpenes are revealed. An object of the present invention is to 
provide a compound other than flavonoides or triterpenes  
 
having an activity to inhibit expression of Epstein-Barr 
virus in latent EBV infected cells and pharmaceutical 
composition containing the same. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an inhibitor of Epstein-Barr virus expression 
comprising at least one compound of the group consisting 
of the formula I: 
wherein each of D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄, D₅, D₆, D₇ and D₈ represents 
R-, Cl-, RO- or RCO-, wherein each R represents a 
hydrogen atom, an alkyl group containing 1-9 carbon atoms 
or an alkene group containing 1-9 carbon atoms 
and the formula II: 
wherein each of E₁, E₂ and E₃ represents R-, ROOC-, 
RCH(OH)- or RCO-, wherein each R represents the same as 
above.  In the above formula I, it is preferable that 
each of D₆ and D₇ represents R₁- or R₁CO-, wherein each R₁ 
represents hydrogen atom or -CH₃. In addition, it is 
also preferable that each of D₅ and D₇ represents R₁O-. 
Further, each of D₁-D₆ preferably represents -OH, -CH₃ or 
-OCH₃. In the above formula II, it is preferable that 
each of E₁ and E₃ represents R₁- or R₁CO-, wherein each R₁ 
represents the same as above. In addition, E₂ preferably 
represents R₁OOC-. Further, each of E₁-E₃ preferably 
represents -CH₃, -COOH or -C₁₃H₂₇. The compounds of the present invention may be 
obtained by chemical synthesis or isolated from 
extraction of natural lichens or lichen cultures. A method for synthesis of the compounds of
