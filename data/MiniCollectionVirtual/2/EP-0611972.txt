<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for forming a Bragg grating in a photosensitive, 
optical waveguiding medium (e.g. optical fiber) by exposure to an 

interference pattern formed by 
overlapping beams of actinic radiation. When Bragg gratings are formed 

according 
to methods of the prior art, these gratings tend to exhibit 

reflectivity spectra having, 
in addition to a central peak, a generally undesirable series of 

subsidiary peaks (sidelobes). 
These subsidiary peaks are caused by a wave interference effect. The 

inventive 
method modifies or eliminates the subsidiary peaks by spatially 

modulating the 
average refractive index of the grating, or by spatially modulating the 

grating period.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the processing of optical waveguiding articles
such as optical fibers, and more specifically to the formation of passive optical
components that are integrated with such waveguiding articles, by using actinic
radiation to modulate the refractive index.Certain optical media, including at least some silica-based optical fibers,
can be modified by exposure to electromagnetic radiation in an appropriate spectral
range. (Such radiation, typically ultraviolet radiation, is referred to below as
"actinic" radiation.) That is, exposure of a photosensitive optical fiber (or other
optical medium) to actinic radiation may cause the refractive index to change in the
exposed portion of the medium. A periodic pattern can be imposed on the impinging
radiation by, e.g., superimposing a pair of beams of substantially monochromatic
radiation from, e.g., a laser, to create an interference pattern. When such a patterned
radiation field impinges on an optical fiber or other optical waveguide having a core
of the appropriate photosensitivity, a corresponding pattern is imposed on the core in
the form of periodic (or quasiperiodic) fluctuations in the core refractive index. Such
a pattern, which is often referred to as a "Bragg grating" or a "distributed Bragg
reflector (DBR)" can behave as a spectrally selective reflector for electromagnetic
radiation. Bragg gratings formed in this manner are particularly useful as end
reflectors in optical fiber lasers. These Bragg gratings are useful both because they
are spectrally selective, and because they are readily incorporated in the same optical
fiber that supports the active laser medium.A technique for creating these Bragg gratings is described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,725,110, issued to W.H. Glenn, et al. on Feb. 16, 1988, and U.S. Patent
No. 4,807,950, issued to W.H. Glenn, et al. on Feb. 28, 1989. An optical fiber laser
having a DBR-terminated cavity is described in G.A. Ball and W.W. Morey,
"Continuously tunable single-mode erbium fiber laser", OpticsLett.17 (1992) 420 -
422.Bragg gratings are useful as passive optical components for other
applications besides end-reflectors in fiber lasers. For example, Bragg gratings are
useful as spectral filters for wavelength-division multiplexing and other optical
signal-processing applications. An optical filter which comprises a Bragg grating 
formed in an optical fiber is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,007,705, issued to
W.W. Morey, et al. on April 16, 1991.We have observed that when a pair of intersecting

A method for manufacturing an article which comprises an optically
waveguiding, photosensitive body having an optical propagation axis, the method

comprising the step of impinging an interfering pair of beams of actinic radiation on the
body such that a Bragg grating is formed therein as an axially disposed pattern of

refractive index perturbations, wherein:

each of said beams has a pulse-shaped cross-sectional profile, leading to
an average refractive index perturbation in the resulting Bragg grating that has a pulse-shaped

axial distribution having a peak portion included between respective side
portions; and
the resulting Bragg grating has a reflectivity spectrum that exhibits, in
addition to a main peak, at least one subsidiary peak that is due to optical resonance

within the peak portion,

   CHARACTERISED IN THAT the method further comprises:

   before or after forming the Bragg grating by impingement of the
interfering pair of beams, adding a further refractive index perturbation that is nonuniform,

in the axial direction, across the Bragg grating, wherein:

the further pattern is added by impinging a non-interfering beam of
actinic radiation of a wavelength to which the waveguiding body is photosensitive; and
the exposure suffered by the waveguiding body due to the non-interfering
beam varies in the axial direction in such a way as to cause modification of

the subsidiary peak relative to the main peak.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of impinging a non-interfering
beam is carried out acentrically with respect to the region of the Bragg

grating and leads to suppression of the subsidiary peak relative to the main peak of the
reflectivity spectrum. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of impinging a non-interfering beam is
carried out such that the further refractive index perturbation is greater in one of said side

portions than in the other of said side portions and leads to suppression of the subsidiary
peak relative to the main peak of the reflectivity spectrum.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of impinging a non-interfering beam is
carried out such that the further refractive index perturbation is greater in the side

portions than in the peak portion and leads to a spectral shift of the subsidiary peak
relative to the main peak.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of impinging a non-interfering beam is
carried out such that the further refractive index perturbation is greater in the peak portion

than in the central portion and leads to enhancement of the subsidiary peak relative to the
main peak.
The method of claim 1, further comprising, during the step of impinging a non-interfering
beam, the steps of axially displacing said beam, and modulating the average

intensity of said beam.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of impinging a non-interfering beam is
carried out such that roughness in the reflectivity spectrum, due to subsidiary peaks, is

reduced to less than 10% relative to the amplitude of the main peak.
