<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic 
charge transfer complex, and more particularly to an 
organic charge transfer complex which is expected to be 
applied to organic electrically conductive materials, 
organic superconductive materials, organic magnetic 
substances, organic electrochromic materials, and organic 
electroluminescent materials. Compounds which are expected to be applied to 
the above-described fields, such as organic electrically 
conductive materials, organic superconductive materials, 
organic magnetic substances, organic electrochromic 
materials, and organic electroluminescent materials, 
include an organic charge transfer complex comprising an 
electron donors (donor molecule) and an electron acceptor 
(acceptor molecule or anion), as described in "TTF-TCNQ 
Complexes and Related Materials", (written by Gunji Saito 
and Kunihiko Yamaji) in The Elements of Chemistry, No. 
42, (Chemistry of Conductive Low Dimensional Materials) 
(1983) edited by Chemical Society of Japan, published by 
the publishing Gakkai Shuppan Center, Japan. Examples of the conventional donor molecules 
include compounds having a fulvalene skeleton such as  
 
tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene 
(TMTSF), and bisethylenedithiatetrathiafulvalene 
(BEDT-TTF). Examples of the conventional acceptor 
molecules include tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). 
Examples of the conventional anions include 
hexafluorophosphate anion (PF₆⁻), perchlorate anion (ClO₄⁻) 
and triiodide anion (I₃⁻). Typical examples of the conventional organic 
charge transfer complexes include electrically conductive 
complexes such as TTF-TCNQ (σRT = 500 s/cm) and TMTSF-TCNQ 
(σRT = 800 s/cm) and superconductive complexes such as 
(TMTSF)₂ClO₄ (critical temperature Tc = 1.4 K), 
β-(BEDT-TTF)₂I₃ (Tc = 8 K), χ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu(NCS)₂ 
(Tc = 10.4 K) and χ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu(N(CN)₂)Cl (Tc = 13 K). However, any of the conductive complexes that 
are put to practical use at present has a problem in that 
anisotropy in electrical conductance is high. Further, 
among the superconductive complexes that are put to 
practical use at present, the compound having the highest 
critical temperature is the above-described 
χ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu(N(CN)₂)Cl having Tc = 13 K, and any 
compound having a critical temperature higher than that 
described above cannot be obtained at present. Accordingly, it is demanded to develop novel 
complexes having characteristics which conventional  
 
complexes do not possess, such as conductive complexes 
having low
