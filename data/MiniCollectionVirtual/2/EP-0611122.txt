<ABSTRACT>
The ostomy pouch 10 has a coupling or securement member 
formed as a washer-shaped wafer 32 of adhesive material, 

preferably a hydrocolloid. The pouch 10 is secured directly onto 
the abdominal wall 13 with the adhesive wafer aligned with the 

stoma 50. Flushability of the pouch is enhanced by forming the 
pouch with converging side walls within an optimum angular range 

and a predetermined pouch width and pouch height. The pouch also 
has a predetermined wall thickness and the wafer is of 

predetermined thickness. Thus when the pouch is deposited in a 
water-saver toilet, bottom end first in a carrier sleeve or bag, 

the pouch can flow in streamlined fashion through the passages of 
a toilet and any sewer pipe or septic line connected to the 

toilet. If the flush capacity of the toilet and the flow rate of 
water through the toilet and sewer line are increased, the ostomy 

pouch can be deposited in the toilet without a carrier sleeve or 
bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to ostomy pouches and
more particularly to a novel flushable ostomy pouch.One of the inconveniences associated with ostomy
care is the disposal of the waste collection pouch or ostomy
pouch after it has been used. Toilet flushing of the pouch
is a most generally sought means of disposal. However major
problems in flushing an ostomy pouch down a toilet are
trapped air within the pouch that creates buoyancy and
structural features of the pouch that can cause the pouch to
become trapped in the flow passages of the toilet or in a
connecting pipe or sewer line.For example, the pouch shown in U.S. Patent
4,490,145 has a face plate with an adhesive layer for
coupling or securing the pouch to the abdomen such that the
waste inlet opening aligns with the stoma. The face plate
and the adhesive coating are usually approximately 0.9 mm (35 mils)
thick and the pouch material is usually approximately 75
microns thick. Although the pouch envelope and the face
plate are flexible in a general sense, they have been found
to lack sufficient flexibility to adequately negotiate the
flow passages of a water-saver type toilet, which uses less
water than a standard flush toilet. Pouch configurations which may be flushable in
standard toilets with standard flush capacity often do not
perform satisfactorily in water-saver type toilets and
occasionally perform inconsistently in standard flush
toilets.One known response to ostomy pouch flushing problems
such as pouch trappage and clogging is to form the ostomy
pouch of material that softens and becomes slimy or slippery
when contacted with water, to promote flowage in a water
passage or pipeline.While a pouch that becomes slimy or slippery upon
immersion in water may have enhanced slidability against wall
surfaces of toilets and sewer lines, the contact of such
material against the body can be uncomfortable if it becomes
wet while it is worn. Such pouches are likely to discourage
a user from engaging in swimming and other physical activity
and generally require protective covering while showering,
Furthermore, pouches formed of water reactive material may
still cause clogging in water-saver toilets with relatively
low volume flush capacity.Another known structure that facilitates flush
disposal of ostomy pouches is that of U.S. Patent 4,830,187,
which shows a plastic carrier sleeve or bag into which a
pouch can be placed before flush disposal. The sleeve or bag
forms a slimy or slippery layer when exposed to water, 
thereby sliding on surfaces that might

A flushable ostomy pouch (10;70) for holding body waste that passes
through a stoma comprising:


a) an envelope (12,14) formed of flexible plastic sheet material defining a
waste collection chamber for body waste that passes through a stoma;
b) a waste inlet opening (30) formed in said envelope for passage of waste
material from said stoma into said collection chamber;
c) said envelope having a top end portion (18), a bottom end portion (26)
opposite said top end portion, and opposite side edge portions (20,22) extending

between said top end portion and said bottom end portion, said side edge portions
(20,22) converging toward each other in a direction from said top end portion to

said bottom end portion such that said envelope in plan view is substantially V-shaped;
and
d) said envelope having a pouch height from said top end portion to said
bottom end portion in the range of approximately 152 to 203mm (6 to 8 inches),

a maximum extent of said top end portion from one side edge portion to the other
side edge portion in the range of approximately 114 to 152mm (4.5 to 6 inches),

and a predetermined angle of convergence of the side edge portions in the range
of approximately 15° to 25°.
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 1 wherein the angle of convergence
of said envelope is approximately 15°, the height is approximately 197mm (7.750

inches) and the maximum width is approximately 130mm (5.125 inches).
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 1 or 2 including bonding means
(32;72) for detachably coupling said envelope around a stoma. 
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 3 wherein said bonding means has
a predetermined bond strength that permits said envelope to be peeled as a unit

away from said stoma.
An ostomy pouch as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said bonding
means includes an adhesive wafer (32;72) provided around said waste inlet opening

(30).
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 5 wherein said adhesive wafer (72)
is approximately 0.25mm (0.010 inches) thick.
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 5 or 6 wherein said adhesive wafer
(32;72) is washer shaped and has an exposed or exposable adhesive surface for

adhering said wafer around a stoma.
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7 wherein said adhesive
wafer (32;72) is a hydrocolloid adhesive.
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 5, 6, 7 or 8 wherein said adhesive
wafer (72) includes a backing layer coated with adhesive, the backing layer being

joined to said envelope.
An ostomy pouch as claimed in claim 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 wherein said adhesive
wafer (72) is formed from an adhesive tape.
A method of facilitating flush disposal of an ostomy pouch comprising:

a) forming an envelope (12,14) of flexible plastic sheet material with a
waste inlet opening and a waste collection chamber, the envelope having a V-shaped

structure with converging sides (20,22) that converge from a top portion

114 and 152mm (4.5 to 6 inches) and the pouch height being between

approximately 152 and 203mm (6 to 8 inches); and
b) providing an adhesive wafer (72) approximately 0.25mm (0.010 inches)
thick around the waste inlet opening to secure the envelope directly to the abdomen

with the waste inlet opening aligned with a stoma.
