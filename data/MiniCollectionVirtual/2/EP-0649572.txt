<ABSTRACT>
A zone plate focusing radiation comprises a plurality of surface portions (20a, 20b, 20c, 20d, 30) corresponding to zones of the zone plate. The surface portions are positioned in a plurality P of parallel planes such that each surface portion diffracts radiation out of phase with respect to adjacent surface portions such that radiation diffracted by the surface portion constructively interferes at a focus of the zone plate. The Pth plane is dielectrically spaced from the first plane by n(lambda), where (lambda) is the wavelength of the radiation and n is an integer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase correcting 
zone plate for focusing radiation. The use of zone plates for focusing radiation such 
as microwaves is well known. One type of zone plate 
disclosed in "Millimetre-Wave Characteristics of Phase 
Correcting Fresnel Zone Plates" by D.N. Black and J. 
Wiltse, IEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and 
Techniques, Volume 35, No. 12 (1987) Pages 1122-1128, is 
the Phase Correcting Fresnel Zone Plate. Such a zone plate 
is shown schematically in Figure 1 for quarter wave 
correction, although a phase correcting zone plate can be 
made for any wavelength fraction. The radius of each zone 
rN can be given by 
rN = (2NfλL + (Nλ/L)2)12 
where N is the zone number, f is the focal length of the 
zone plate, λ is the wavelength of the radiation, and 
L is an integer greater than 2. For quarter wave 
correction L = 4. For such a zone plate both in and out of 
focus zones contribute to the energy at the focus thus 
increasing the efficiency compared to a conventional 
blocking zone plate. The correction of the phase by the 
zones is achieved by changing the pathlength of the energy 
reflected from the zone for a reflection zone plate. This 
is equally applicable to a transmission zone plate acting 
as a Fresnel lens where the correction of the phase by the 
zones is achieved by changing the pathlength of the energy 
transmitted through that zone. In transmission the 
dielectric material is placed behind the zone surface  
 
whilst in reflection as shown in Figure 1 the dielectric 
material is placed in front of the reflective zone 
surface. Thus the energy reflected from the zone 2a of the 
quarter wave zone plate of Figure 1 would be out of phase 
with respect to the energy from the zone 3 by λ/4 at the 
focus, unless the path length was decreased or increased by 
λ/4. An increase in pathlength of λ/4 is achieved by 
providing steps λ/3 in depth in the reflection arrangement 
or λ/4 for transmission. Thus zone 2a is λ/8 higher 
than zone 3 and zone 2b and 2c are λ/4 and 3λ/8 higher 
than zone 3 respectively. More generally, the different 
phases of the zones of the zone plate are stepped by d 
where 
d = λ0/2L  
where λ0 is the free space wavelength of the radiation. 
Thus the purpose of the zones is to impart a varying phase 
shift on the incoming signal such that the radiation 
diffracted by the zones to a focus is in phase. In the prior art this has been achieved by quarter 
wave zone plates having zones which provide phase shifts of 
0 and 360°, 90°, 180° and
