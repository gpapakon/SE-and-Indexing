<ABSTRACT>
The gene coding a fungine endopolygalacturonase inhibitor (PGIP) is cloned and sequenced from both Phaseolus vulgaris genomic and cDNA libraries. The PGIP amino acid sequence, vectors comprising the PGIP gene or parts thereof, cells transformed by said vectors are also disclosed. The isolated sequences are useful to transform plants, which are sensitive to fungi or microorganism pathogen activities, into plants producing the PGIP protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NϋCT-EOTIDE SEQUENCES CODING AN -E-NDOPOLYGALACTURONASE----NH-EB-E CKThis invention relates to nucleotide sequences coding a endopolygalacturonase inhibiter.More particularly, this invention relates to a gene coding a new protein having an inhibiting activity against the fungine endopolygalacturonase enzyme, or fractions thereof, and to the protein itself or fractions thereof. The invention relates also to recombinant vectors comprising such sequences, to cells and plants transformed by means of such recombinant vectors and to the use of such vectors and cells to produce the protein. References are enclosed at the end of this specification as they are orderly quoted.The fungine endo alpha-1, -D-polygalactorunase enzyme (EC 3.21.15) is an important pathogenic factor for plants (1,2). Actually, the enzyme catalizeε the scission reaction of polygalacturonic acid and induces the subsequent solubilization of plant cell wall homo-alpha-l,4-D-galactorunanes, thus facilitating the fungi to penetrate into plant tissues and then supplying the same fungi with nutritional substrates. Moreover, the activity of such an enzyme could, if controlled, produce non-virulence factors, i.e. 

 factors able to activate some plant defence mechanisms by converting plant cell wall homogalactorunanes into oligogalacturonides, which are known to stimulate phytoalexine synthesis and other defence mechanisms as well (2) .An inhibiting activity of fungine endopolygalacturonase, associated to the cell wall, named PGIP, has been detected in dicot plants.The authors of the present invention have already detected such activity in different plant tissues of Phaseolus vulgaris T,. (3) , showing that the same is specific for fungine endopolygalacturonases, with no activity with either bacterial or vegetable enzymes, or other pectic enzymes of microbial origin (4) . Moreover, the authors found that the PGIP is able to stabilize in vitro an oligogalacturonide mixture which stimulates phytoalexines (5) .Therefore it is evident the need to purify and isolate the molecule responsible for such activity by means of cloning coding PGIP sequences. Said sequences may be inserted in suitable vectors to transform plants that are sensitive to fungi or other microorganism pathogens, into plants producing the PGIP protein on large scale. The protein could be then used with many advantages in the food industry. 

 Till now attempts to isolate the PGIP gene have been unsuccessful, essentially due to low levels of the protein in vegetable tissues.The
