<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the colorimetric determination of an analyte by means of enzymatic oxidation with a PQQ-dependent dehydrogenase in the presence of an electron acceptor from the group of electron-rich aromatic nitroso compounds by enzymatic reduction of the nitroso compound to an imino compound and detection of the imino compound by colour formation. The invention furthermore relates to a corresponding composition which contains a PQQ-dependent dehydrogenase, an electron-rich aromatic nitroso compound and, where appropriate, a detection reagent for imino compounds. The invention also relates to nitrosoamino compounds which, on reduction, form coloured quinonediimines, and to the use thereof for the colorimetric enzymatic determination of an analyte.
