<ABSTRACT>
In a light-wave distance meter based on light 
pulses, a light pulse radiation device radiates light 

pulses emitted by a light source device to a target of 
measurement, a light reception device receives reflected 

light pulses from the target, a sampling device samples 
reception signals, a timing device applies a dither of a 

certain range to the light pulse emission timing and 
sampling timing, a cumulative memory device stores 

sampled signals at a certain interval cumulatively, and 
a computation device calculates the distance to the 

target. The distance meter is capable of measuring the 
position of received light pulses at a resolution higher 

than the sampling timing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
distance meter according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1, and particularly
to a light-wave distance meter based on light pulses
which detects the time interval of return light pulses
accurately by means of a relatively simple circuit
arrangement and enables such a long distance measurement
in which the noise dominates over the signal.Conventional light-wave distance meters are
designed to receive an echo light pulse returning from a
corner cube prism that is placed at a target of
measurement.The basic principle of these conventional
light-wave distance meters will first be explained with
reference to Fig. 10. A light emission means is
activated by an emission timing signal a', and it emits
a light pulse b'. The radiated light pulse b' is
reflected by the measurement target, and thereafter it
is received by a light reception means and converted
into a return pulse signal c'. The return pulse signal
c' is rendered the A/D conversion in response to clock
pulses d', and the resulting data is stored in a 
memory. These operations are repeated for several
emission light pulses b', and the stored data are
averaged. The averaged data e' in the memory has its
addresses for points on the waveform corresponding to
measured values of the distance to the target, and the
distance L from the distance meter to the target is
calculated from the address A of the peak value of the
data as follows.
L= (A*C)/(fs*2)
where C is the velocity of light, and fs is the
frequency of the clock signal d'; in the formulas herein, an asterisk (*) denotes multiplication.However, the conventional light-wave distance
meters based on light pulses have their measuring
accuracy depending on the resolution of detection of the
return light pulse, and therefore these distance meters
need to have a sampling clock period for A/D conversion
small enough relative to the width of the return pulse
signal c' and need to have an A/D converter with a large
number of bits. Specifically, in case the light
emission means is a pulsed laser diode, which generally
has a light pulse emission width of around 10 ns, the
clock signal d' must have a frequency of several
hundred MHz. The need of a very fast A/D converter
results in an expensive distance meter. Moreover, the conventional light-wave distance
meters are designed to average stored data produced from
several radiation light pulses b' after recieving last radiation light pulse, and this calculation
process imposes a great load to the computation means.
