<ABSTRACT>
All the carousels of the machine are provided with 
grippers for holding the flasks. A carousel with 

grippers (6) for holding the flask by the neck is 
followed by a carousel with grippers (7) for holding the 

flask by the body and so on. Between the jaws of each 
gripper there is provided in the middle region a vertical 

opposition element (35) fixed onto a horizontal slide 
(36) supported by the gripper body (33) and connected to 

means which modify the position of the said opposition 
element according to the diameter of the flasks. The 

opposition element is directed towards the flask with a 
concave-profile front face. The orbits (29, 30) along 

which the grippers of two consecutive carousels travel 
intersect each other in the zone where the flasks pass 

from one carousel to the other. In this zone the flask 
is immediately held between the opposition elements of 

the opposite grippers of the carousels, which open and 
close alternately. The opposition elements of one of the 

two consecutive carousels are spring-mounted. Preferably 
the opposition elements of the grippers of the operating 

carousels are immobile and the opposition elements of the 
grippers of the service carousels are spring-mounted. 

Special variable-profile cams control the transfer of the 
flasks between the carousels of the machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic 
machine with a high production output and great degree of 
operational flexibility, used for filling and closing 
flasks or other containers. Flask filling and sealing machines formed by a 
succession of carousels are known, some of these 
carousels being provided with grippers for holding the 
flasks, while others are of the so-called star-type with 
perimetral alcoves into which the flasks themselves fit 
snugly. In the case of star-type carousels, the star 
devices must be replaced when there is a variation in the 
size of the flasks, and the flasks themselves rub against 
fixed parts guiding and retaining the actual flasks 
inside the alcoves of the star devices. The invention aims to overcome this first 
drawback with a machine formed by a succession of 
carousels, all provided with grippers which alternately 
grip the flasks by the neck and by the body, it being 
preferably envisaged that, in the main carousels where 
filling and sealing is performed, the flasks are gripped 
by the body so that their top part is completely free for 
the operating means and is in the best possible state for 
receiving any flow of gases which ensure hygienic or 
sterile conditions for packaging of the product inside 
the said flasks. In machines of the known type, where 
cooperation between two carousels with grippers may be 
necessary, the grippers of a carousel are operated so as 
to be able to oscillate in advance or with a delay on an  
 
axis parallel to that of the carousel itself, so as to 
follow over a sufficiently long section the orbit on 
which the grippers of another carousel are moving and so 
as to have a sufficient amount of time for the opening 
and closing operations, even in the case of high 
peripheral speeds of the carousels. This solution 
involves constructional complications, in particular on 
account of the adjustments which are necessary when there 
is a variation in the size of the flasks. According to the invention, this drawback is 
overcome in that the grippers are mounted on the 
carousels in a fixed radial arrangement and the orbits 
along which the grippers of consecutive carousels move 
intersect each other. Between the jaws of each gripper, 
in the middle position, there is provided a vertical 
opposition element which acts on the body of the flask 
and which is directed towards the latter with a concave 
self-centering profile. Moreover, the opposition 
elements of the grippers of a carousel, preferably the 
operating carousels, are

<CLAIMS>
Automatic machine for filling and 
closing flasks or other containers, of the type which 

comprises means (2, 3) for supplying the flasks (1) in 
single file, one at a time and in a synchronised manner, 

to a first transfer carousel (4) which in turn supplies 
a filling carousel (8) which transfers the filled flasks 

to a following transfer carousel (10) which passes them 
on to a sealing carousel (12) which finally transfers 

them to means (18, 19, 20) for transporting and conveying 
them away in a single file and for sorting, where 

necessary, the correctly filled and sealed flasks from 
those which are not correctly filled and/or sealed, and 

of the type which comprises small carousels (21, 25) 
which cooperate with the first and with the second 

transfer carousel and with respective weighing units (24, 
28) for recording, with a progressive weighing and 

sampling system and with the cyclical formation of 
unfilled spaces in the supply of the flasks to the first 

transfer carousel, first the tare weight of the flasks 
and then the gross weight of the said flasks, and for 

then recording, by means of processing, the weight of the 
product delivered by each operating station of the 

filling carousel, characterized in that all the carousels 
are provided with grippers for the positive gripping of 

the flasks, so that the machine is able to handle a wide 
range of sizes of flasks without it being necessary to 

replace the components, but by means of simple 
adjustments which can be easily automated, a carousel 

with neck-holding grippers (6) being followed by a 
carousel with body-holding grippers (7), and so on, and 

the operating carousels, i.e. the filling carousel (8) 
and the sealing carousel (12), being preferably provided 

with grippers (7) for holding the flasks by their body, 
so as to leave the mouth of the flasks completely free 

for the action of the carousel operating means and better 
able to be protected from any flow of cleaning or 

sterilising gas which affects in a known manner the 
entire machine when the latter is used for packaging  

 
medicinal or other products which require such 

protection.

of the closed gripper which must release it and the 
opposition element of the open gripper which must grip it 

and such that the opposition elements of the grippers of 
a carousel are movable against the action of suitable 

elastic means, in order to react to the intersecting of
