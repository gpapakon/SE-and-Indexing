<ABSTRACT>
A system for inserting suture anchors includes a suture anchor insertion tool (10), a suture anchor (12), a length of suture thread (14) and any needles (16) pre-attached thereto. The suture anchor insertion tool having a handle (18), an elongate suture anchor inserting member (26), a suture thread retaining cap (44) provided on the handle, an internal retaining cavity (28) formed integrally with the handle, and a cover (36) member that is selectively positionable so as to enclose the internal cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to surgical systems for inserting a suture anchor into bodily tissue. More particularly, the invention relates to a suture anchor insertion tool which may be used to insert a suture anchor having a length of suture thread attached thereto.Systems and devices for anchoring sutures to bone are commonly used in medical or surgical operations. Anchored sutures are typically used to attach soft tissue, such as ligaments, tendons and muscles, to bone or inanimate objects, such as prostheses, to bone. The attachment may hold the tissue to a bone for an extended period of time to allow healing to occur. Alternatively, the attachment may be used to hold tissue in place temporarily during a surgical procedure to help perform or optimize that procedure.Suture anchors typically have an anchor body, a suture attachment feature and a bone engaging feature for retaining the suture anchor within bone. The suture anchor may be inserted into a preformed hole in the bone, or with threaded (i.e., screw-type) suture anchors, the suture anchor may be screwed into the bone, with or without a preformed bore, in the manner of a common screw. Examples of suture anchors and suture anchor installation tools may be found in United States Patent Nos. 4,946,468; 4,968,315; 5,002,550; 5,207,679; 5,217,486; 5,411,506; 5,411,523; 5,520,696; 5,522,845; 5,578,057 and 5,584,860 and EP0611551, which letter document discloses a suture anchor installation system comprising the features found in the preamble of claim 1, as appended hereto.Small suture anchors can be difficult to handle and manipulate with some existing suture anchor insertion tools. In particular, it can be difficult to retain a small suture anchor on the insertion tool until such time as the anchor is inserted into bone. Because of their small size, these suture anchors are difficult to reattach to the insertion tool in a surgical environment if they become prematurely separated from the insertion tool.Suture management during and after insertion of the anchor can be challenging as well. Smaller suture anchors, which are often pre-loaded onto the insertion tool and pre-threaded with suture thread, must be managed to ensure that the anchors and any attached suture thread and needles are properly delivered to the surgical site.One known approach to suture management is to carry the suture thread inside a cannulated suture anchor insertion tool, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,584,860, 5,411,506 and 5,258,016. This approach is sometimes used with

<CLAIMS>
A suture anchor insertion system, comprising:

a handle member (18) having a proximal end, a distal end, and a side wall (24) disposed between the proximal and distal ends, the side wall (24) defining an internal cavity (28) suitable for storing at least one suture needle (16) and suture thread (14);
a cover member (36) disposed on the side wall (24) of the handle member (18) and being movable between at least a first, open position and a second, closed position wherein the cover member (36) encloses the internal cavity (28) in a manner sufficient to retain at least one suture needle (16) and suture thread (14) within the internal cavity (28);
a suture thread retaining member (42) disposed on the handle member (18); and
an elongate suture anchor inserting member (26) extending from the distal end of the handle member (18) and having a suture anchor seating element (54) at a distal end thereof, the suture anchor seating element (54) being for releasably seating a suture anchor (12); and
the system being 
characterised in that
:

the suture thread retaining member (42) comprises a base element (46) for receiving suture thread (14) and a cap element (44) that is selectively matable with the base element (46) to retain a suture thread (14) in a state of tension so that a suture anchor (12) is thereby retained in a state of tension by the suture thread retaining member (42).
The system of claim 1, wherein the base element (46) and the cap element (44) are substantially circular in shape.
The system of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the suture thread retaining member (42) is disposed within the internal cavity (28) of the handle member (18).
The system of claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the suture thread retaining member (42) is made from a polymeric material.
The system of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the cover member (36) encloses the suture thread retaining member (42) when the cover is in its second, closed position.
The system of claim 5, wherein the cover member (36) further has an intermediate position wherein the suture thread retaining member (42) is not enclosed by the cover member (36) and a proximal portion of the cavity (28) is enclosed in a manner sufficient to retain at least one suture needle (16) and suture thread (14) within the internal cavity (28).
The system of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the suture anchor seating element (54) comprises a flat, distal facing surface and a seating pin extending distally from the flat, distal-facing surface.
The system of claim 7, further comprising a suture anchor, wherein a proximal end of the suture anchor (12) has a pin receiving cavity (28) that is releasably matable with the seating pin.
The system of claim 8, wherein the suture anchor (12) is retained on the suture anchor seating element (54) by means of the seating pin and tension on the suture thread (14).
The system of claim 8 or claim 9, wherein the suture anchor (12) is generally cylindrical and the suture anchor seating element (54) has a diameter that is no greater than the diameter of the suture anchor (12).
The system of claim 10, wherein the diameter of the seating element (54) of the suture anchor insertion member (26) and the diameter of the suture anchor (12) are each less than about 3.0 mm.
A suture anchor insertion system of any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein the suture thread retaining member base element (46) has a peripheral rim and cap element (44) is movable between a first, open position wherein the cap element is spaced apart from the peripheral rim of the base element and a second, closed position wherein the cap element mates with the base element in proximity to the peripheral rim.
The suture anchor insertion system of claim 12, wherein the cap element mates with the base element by means of a friction fit.
The suture anchor insertion system of claim 13, wherein the base element is generally cylindrical and the peripheral rim is generally round.
The suture anchor insertion system of any one of claims 12 to 14, wherein the internal cavity (28) comprises proximal and distal portions and the suture thread retaining member is located in the distal portion of the internal cavity (28).
The suture anchor insertion system of any one of claims 1 to 15, further comprising a suture thread (14) having an intermediate portion attached to the suture anchor (12) and two free trailing ends extending at least the length of the suture anchor inserting member (26).
