<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vulcanizable olefinic elastomers and to specific
applications of compositions comprising them. In particular the invention relates to
elastomeric compositions having improved properties of processability, compound
strength and elasticity before and after vulcanization, and long-term heat resistance of
the vulcanized compounds.The use of vulcanized rubber in many applications is well documented in public
literature. Due to the inherent properties of the essentially elastic olefinic polymers
many enduse applications require the use of modifying and reinforcing materials to bring
out desired properties. Thus a rubber compounder will strive to arrive at a formulation
that will give the best balance of processing behaviour, vulcanization (cure) rate,
vulcanizate physical properties and cost. The olefin-based elastomers of this invention
are well-known to be some of the cheapest polymers currently available and yet still
capable of achieving excellent properties in many of the otherwise most adverse
applications.Olefinic rubbers find many uses in the automotive industry because of their
relatively low cost and as well because of their properties with respect to moldability and
extrudability, or ability to be readily shaped as desired, and their ability to withstand
oxidative attack. In particular the rubber compounds based upon ethylene-propylene
monomer ("EPM") and ethylene-propylene-diene monomer ("EPDM") elastomeric
polymers are playing an ever-expanding role both for underhood and body sealing parts.
In particular it is known that certain EPDM grades have shown excellent promise as
automotive coolant hose polymers and as seals and gaskets for both the automotive
and building industries where large temperature extremes test the ability to maintain an
elastic seal.In these applications it is known that the preferred compounds can typically have
120-170 parts per hundred parts rubber ("phr") of industry-used carbon blacks as
reinforcing fillers that serve to both strengthen and further reduce the overall cost of the 
compounds. The typically used and recommended carbon blacks are those furnace
blacks meeting ASTM designations (ASTM D 1765-1979) and falling into the following
classes: N550 FEF, N650 GPF, N762 SRF and N683 APF. Among these, N650/683
and N762 are closely defined as standard blacks in ISO/DIN 6809.The usefulness of EPDM polymers in these compounds depends on the cure rate
and cure state as well as the ease of fabrication. Thus it is known that improved
properties of
