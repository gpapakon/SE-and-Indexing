<ABSTRACT>
In the described electrically powered foldable outer 
rearview mirror which comprises a base (43), a shaft (10) 

mounted on the base (43) and having a flange portion (20) and 
a cylindrical portion (11) which is provided on the flange 

portion (43), and a frame (15) engaged to 
rotate about the cylindrical portion (11) and having a bottom 

portion (24), the flange portion (20) of the shaft (10) 
comprise a slide surface (Sa) and the bottom portion (24) of 

the frame (15) comprises a protruding sliding portion (S) 
which surface contact the slide surface (Sa) to have the frame 

(15) sliding smoothly around the cylindrical portion (11), for 
causing a precise stop of the mirror folding movement and an 

interruption of the electric power. Further, for causing a 
precise stop of the erecting movement, the frame (15) at the 

bottom portion (24) has an arc-shaped groove (31) and a plate 
stopper element (14) including a pair of recess portions which 

have steps (14a, 14b) symmetric with reference to the 
cylindrical portion of the frame, the flange portion (20) of 

the shaft (10) has a shaft stopper element (32) which is 
loosely engaged in the arc-shaped groove (31) of the frame 

(15) and a pair of semi-spherical apertures (12) wherein a 
ball (13) is each retained; and means for rotating the frame 

determine the frame positions: the normal state in which one 
of the steps (14a) of each recess of the plate stopper element 

(14) contacts the respective ball (13), and the backward state 
in which the shaft stop element (32) contacts one of the 

groove edges of the arc-shaped groove (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for folding 
a mirror body of an electrically powered foldable outer 
rearview mirror for a motor vehicle, especially to a folding 
mechanism for the mirror body having an improved stability and 
reliability. Outer rearview mirrors for motor vehicles are known to be 
mounted protruding from the vehicle side, and are designed to 
be foldable so as not to stand in the way of parking the 
vehicle in the garage or the like. A foldable outer rearview mirror corresponding to the 
preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0331741. Therein, the 
flange portion of the shaft has circular recesses, and the 
bottom portion of the frame comprises a space housing a 
compression spring and a ball resiliently engaged in the 
recess when the mirror is in its normal state or in its 
backward state. Also a system disclosed in Published Japanese Patent 
Application Hei 2-290754 comprises a shaft, a mirror housing 
rotatably supported on the shaft and a clutch means 
controlling the rotation of the mirror housing. The shaft  
 
includes at its bottom part a flange portion and protruding 
from the flange portion a cylindrical portion, a pair of arc-shaped 
grooves being provided in the flange portion surface 
opposite to the cylindrical portion. A bracket is provided at 
the bottom of the mirror housing, and the surface where the 
mirror body is rotated and supported and a pair of semi-spherical 
recesses are provided on the undersurface of this 
bracket. Balls are retained in the semi-spherical recesses and 
are engaged with the arc-shaped grooves provided in the fixed 
surface of the flange to rotate the mirror housing around the 
shaft. The mirror housing is rotated by a driving force 
transmission means as a motor and a gear or the like. The arc-shaped 
groove has certain steps, i. e. depth differences, to 
terminate the movement of the balls. In this system, when the 
motor is operated to rotate the mirror housing to the backward 
position, the balls approach the one step of the arc-shaped 
groove and the motor is electrically cut off just before each 
ball contacts the step. The driving force transmission means 
as gears or the like has back-lash so as not to halt the 
rotation of the mirror housing simultaneously with the stop 
of the motor operation, so that the mirror housing is 
inertially further rotated until the balls contact the steps. 
Also when the mirror housing is rotated to the normal 
position, the motor is electrically cut off just before each 
ball contacts the

An electrically powered foldable outer rearview mirror 
comprising: 


a base (43); 
a shaft (10) mounted on the base (43) and having a flange 
portion (20) and a cylindrical portion (11) which is provided 

on the flange portion (20); and 
a frame (15) engaged to rotate about the cylindrical 
portion (11) and having a bottom portion (24); 
 
   the flange portion (20) of the shaft (10) on one hand, and 

the bottom portion (24) of the frame (15) on the other hand, 
comprising a slide surface (Sa) and a protruding sliding 

portion (S) which surface contacts the slide surface (Sa) to 
have the frame (15) sliding smoothly around the cylindrical 

portion (11);
 
   characterized in that 


the frame (15) at the bottom portion (24) has an arc-shaped
