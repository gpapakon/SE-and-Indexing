<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire having a transponder therein (7) 
comprises a pair of sidewall portions and a crown 

portion toroidally arranged between a pair of bead cores 
(2), and a method of reading and writing of the 

transponder buried in the tire, characterized in that 
the transponder is buried in a projected portion (6) at 

the inner surface of a bead portion of the tire, and the 
axial direction of the transponder is along the 

circumferential direction of the tire, and a rod antenna 
used for receiving and transmission for the transponder 

is moved as an axial line of the rod antenna along the 
circumferential direction of the tire when the reading 

and writing is done from outside of the tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatic tire having a 
transponder therein for transmitting information 
concerning the tire, and to a method of and a device for 
reading and writing of a transponder. The basic technique of a transponder which can transmit 
and receive at the same time has been established and 
has been adopted in various fields. One application of the transponder is for pneumatic 
tires. The transponder is used in order to obtain 
information concerning the tire, inner pressure, 
temperature and the number of rotations, etc. For 
instance, a technique of receiving an information signal 
of the transponder after an electrical signal is 
transmitted to the transponder buried in the tire is 
shown in Japanese utility model application No. 2-123404. The transponder comprises integrated circuits, coils and 
covers which protect this equipment. The shapes of the 
transponder can be coin shape, cylindrical shape, etc. 
and the transponder is relatively small. In the above 
application, edge portions of a carcass wound around 
bead cores and outer portions of the carcass in buttress  
 
portions (outer edge of a sidewall portion in a radial 
direction of the tire) are described for the portion in 
which the transponder is buried. For adaption of the transponder to the tire, therefore, 
it is necessary to miniaturize the transponder and 
select locations to bury the transponder in view of 
durability carefully as well. Because of this reason, 
such limitations as described in the above mentioned 
application occur. Meanwhile, a device for reading and writing of the 
transponder (called reading device hereinafter) 
receiving and transmitting a signal to the transponder 
buried in a certain location is described in Japanese 
patent publication No. 4-501939 and US patent No. 
5181975, etc. Since the transponder is a foreign object to the tire, 
attention has to be paid to the durability when the 
transponder is buried in the tire. The internal 
environment of a tire is severe for electrical apparatus 
such as a transponder. Therefore, damage caused by an 
external force through the tire and heat generated in 
the tire should be prevented. In the tire containing the transponder, the technique of 
communicating practically and stably with the  
 
transponder buried in the tire is a basic task. 
Further, an improvement of the durability which means 
protection of the transponder exposed in a severe 
environment such as the inside of the tire and 
deterioration of the tire caused by the transponder as
