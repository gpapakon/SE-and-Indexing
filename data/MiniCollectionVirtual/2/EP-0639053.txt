<ABSTRACT>
Frozen comestibles, such as frozen desserts, are formed by combining a comestible composition with a matrix resulting from melt-spinning an oleaginous substance with a carrier material such as sucrose or maltodextrin. Also, dry comestibles, suitable for combining with comestible compositions for preparing frozen and unfrozen desserts, are formed from a melt-spun oleaginous containing matrix. Methods of preparing such products are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new frozen
comestibles, and, in a more particular aspect, it relates
to low fat frozen desserts with the organoleptic
characteristics of high fat frozen desserts. The invention
also relates to methods of making the frozen comestibles.Food technology in recent years has focused on
providing high quality food products which are low in
calorie content and low in cost. In this regard, the
frozen dessert industry has attempted to provide reduced-fat
products which have organoleptic properties similar to
the same products having a normally higher fat content.
This objective is particularly difficult to achieve in
frozen food products because the product is subjected to
low temperatures which can have an adverse effect on the
blend of ingredients.Ice cream, for example, is a frozen dessert recognized
for its smooth, creamy texture achieved by delicately
balancing formulated ingredients and processing steps to
provide the desired coldness, melt-down, mouthfeel and
other taste characteristics.Primary components of ice cream products are the
dairy-based ingredients. In earlier times, milk and cream
provided the basic ingredients, i.e., milk protein, milk 
sugar, milkfat (butterfat), emulsifiers and stabilizers, necessary for making ice cream
products. In current commercial operations, ice cream formulations can also include
nonfat milk solids, milk fat, sugar and water to replace some or all of the traditional
ingredient milk/cream, as well as other non-dairy ingredients such as egg yolks, emulsifiers
and stabilizers.By definition, ice cream must contain not less than 10% milk fat and 20% total milk
solids. Unfortunately, milk fats add a significant amount of calories to the ice cream. Ice
milks have been introduced to reduce the amount of calories in the product. Ice milks are
formulated to be low in milk fat and to include primarily nonfat milk solids. Some ice
milks, however, contain high percentages of nonfat milk solids which can impart a gritty or
chalky mouthfeel. This drawback is chiefly due to the high levels of solids which do not
melt in the oral cavity. In addition, the higher concentrations of crystallized lactose present
in nonfat milk solids can also contribute to inferior organoleptic qualities.Thus, ingredients and methods are constantly being sought to provide a reduced fat
frozen comestible with a creamy texture and a lubriciousness characteristic of a higher fat
content food product.US-A-5 011 532 discloses a matrix made by melt spinning sugar and an
