<ABSTRACT>
A cassette eject mechanism for a recording or reproducing 
apparatus can remove a cassette eject button from a housing and can 

reliably eject a tape cassette only when a tape cassette should be 
loaded or unloaded. A battery loading mechanism for an electronic 

equipment can make the loading of battery simple and reliable, and 
becomes easy to handle. The locking mechanism can be simplified in 

structure so that the number of assembly parts can considerably be 
reduced. Further, a mechanical chassis supporting mechanism in a 

recording apparatus is for use with an apparatus in which a mechanical 
chassis or cabinet can be reduced in thickness. According to this 

mechanical chassis supporting mechanism, it is possible to prevent an 
external stress from being applied to the mechanical chassis as a 

twisting deform force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to recording or reproducing
apparatus, for example a so-called single unit video
camera-recorder having a camera function and a recording or
reproducing function and including a cassette eject
mechanism. The apparatus preferably also includes a battery
loading mechanism (also usable in other electronic
equipment, such as a liquid crystal television receiver)
and a mechanical chassis supporting mechanism therefor.Single-unit video camera-recorders are now
commercially available. A single unit video camera-recorder
needs various operations buttons provided on the
housing to take a picture and various operation switch
buttons to record a video signal or to reproduce a recorded
video signal. Of the above-mentioned operation switch
buttons, the single-unit video camera-recorder needs
cassette eject buttons disposed on the housing to perform
the recording or reproduction.EP-A-0 393 647 gives an example of this kind of apparatus.
This document is used for the delimitation of claim 1.Since the single-unit video camera-recorder has many
operation switches disposed on its housing as described
above, the user may operate the wrong switch button
unintentionally. Therefore, the single-unit video camera-recorder
has an image that it is not so easy for the user
to handle.Of the various operation switch buttons, if the user
operates the cassette eject button inadvertently, there is
then the problem that a tape cassette is ejected from the
single-unit video camera-recorder to interrupt the
recording or reproducing operation during the recording or
reproduction. Therefore, when the single-unit video camera-recorder 
is used outdoors, from a portability standpoint,
the single-unit video camera-recorder has various
mechanical restrictions, such as where to dispose a
cassette eject button and how to provide a cassette eject
button locking mechanism.Another problem is that inspection and/or repair of
the head drum cannot easily be carried out.According to the invention there is provided a
recording or reproducing apparatus including a cassette
eject mechanism comprising a main body portion having a
cassette compartment disposed therein, a lid portion
supported on the main body portion so as to become openable
and closable, a pair of guide arms supported on the lid
portion to assist the lid portion to be opened and closed
relative to the main body portion, and a cassette eject
switch to be operated in a ganged relation to an opening
operation of the lid portion, characterised in that the lid
portion is

<CLAIMS>
A recording or reproducing apparatus including a
cassette eject mechanism comprising:


a main body portion (2) having a cassette compartment
(27) disposed therein;
a lid portion (3) supported on the main body portion
so as to become openable and closable;
a pair of guide arms (8, 9) supported on the lid
portion (3) to assist the lid portion (3) to be opened and

closed relative to the main body portion (2); and a
cassette eject switch (30) to be operated in a ganged

relation to an opening operation of the lid portion (3);

   
characterised in that
:-

the lid portion (3) is supported on the main body
portion by means of a hinge portion (4) about which it is

openable and closeable; and
the pair of guide arms (8,9) can be detached from the
lid portion (3) to allow the lid portion (3) to be opened

wide to expose a drum portion (27a) of the recording or
reproducing apparatus (1).
A recording or reproducing apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein the cassette eject switch (30) is

energized by one (9)of the pair of guide arms (8,9).
A recording or reproducing apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein the guide arm (9) includes a lock

mechanism (31, 32) to lock the lid portion (3) when the lid
portion (3) is in the opened state. 
A recording or reproducing apparatus according to
claim 1, wherein either of the lid portion (3) and the main

body portion (2) includes a lid pop-up mechanism (33, 34,
35).
