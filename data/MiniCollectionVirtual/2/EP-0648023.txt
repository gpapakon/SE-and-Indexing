<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a mobile communicator comprising an 
antenna (3) built in a portable telephone body (1), and a circuit 

board (2) built in the communicator body (1) and provided with a 
ground electrode pattern (2a) arranged between an outer surface 

part (1a), which is brought into contact with or approximated to 
a human head portion, and the antenna (3). A transmission output 

of the antenna (3) toward the human head portion is attenuated by 
the ground electrode pattern (2a) of the circuit board (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile communicator, and
more particularly, it relates to an improvement in a mobile
communicator having a built-in antenna.Fig. 1 shows a portable telephone 71 as an exemplary
conventional mobile communicator. An omnidirectional whip
antenna 70 is mounted to project from an upper portion of the
portable telephone 71, for transmitting electric waves.Fig. 2 shows another exemplary conventional portable
telephone 81 which is known in the art. An omnidirectional whip
antenna 80 is mounted on an upper portion of this portable
telephone 81, while a plate-type inverted-F antenna 82 is
mounted in the interior of the portable telephone 81. The whip
antenna 80 is adapted to transmit electric waves while the
inverted-F antenna 82 is adapted to receive electric waves, so
that a diversity unit is formed by the whip antenna 80 and the
inverted-F antenna 82.In relation to the aforementioned conventional mobile
communicators, however, it has recently been pointed out that
the electric waves transmitted by the omnidirectional whip
antennas 70 and 80 are also radiated toward a human head portion, 
to exert bad influence on the human body as the case may be.A cordless telephone set known from JP-4-220 851 comprises a body having
an outer surface part to be brought into contact with or approximated
to a human head portion. An antenna being disposed in the telephone
body. For attenuating a transmission output of the antenna disposed in
the telephone toward a human head portion an electromagnetic wave
shielding member consisting of an electromagnetic wave absorbing body
and an electromagnetic wave reflecting body is provided on the outer surface
part to be brought into contact with or approximated to a human head
portion.Further, a portable radio or a movable communicator disclosed in EP 0 214
806 A2 comprises a diversity unit having a whip antenna extending from
the communicator body and a narrow band square microstrip antenna disposed
in the communicator body. The microstrip antenna is used as receiving
antenna whereas the wip antenna is used for both receiving and transmitting.The object of the present invention is to provide a mobile communicator
which can reduce the influence exerted on a human body by transmitted
electric waves effectively.This object is achieved by the movable communicator described in claim 1.According to the present invention it is possible to reduce the strength of
electromagnetic waves which are radiated toward the human body in
transmission due to the ground
