<ABSTRACT>
The refillable polyester bottle of the invention has a 
mean crystallinity of 32 to 70 % at the bottle body, a 

methanol adsorption of 1,500 ppm or less at the same 
portion and a paraxylene adsorption of 300 ppm or less at 

the same portion. Therefore, the bottle is excellent in 
non-adsorptivity and heat resistance. According to the 

method of removing adsorbates on a polyester bottle of the 
invention, the adsorbates can be rapidly desorbed by 

holding the bottle in air of 40 to 150 째C or bringing the 
bottle into contact with water or water vapor heated at 40 

to 150 째C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester bottle
and a method of removing adsorbates on the polyester
bottle. More particularly, the invention relates to a
refillable polyester bottle having excellent non-adsorptivity
and high heat resistance and also relates to a
method of rapidly desorbing adsorbates on the polyester
bottle.Various plastics, e.g., polyethylene terephthalate,
have been conventionally used as materials for bottles of
juices, natural water, tea and other drinks. The plastic
bottles are usually disposable, but they have been recently
required to be recovered and recycled after use from the
viewpoints of saving energy and saving natural resources.For recycling the plastic bottles, the bottles are
washed and sterilized to remove organic or inorganic
substances attached thereto and adsorbates such as
substances having a taste or a scent adsorbed thereon, and
then filled with contents. Even if the attached substances
are completely removed by the washing, however, it is
difficult to completely remove the adsorbates on the 
bottles. Therefore, after filling of the contents, the
adsorbates are transferred to the contents thereby, to
cause deterioration of the taste or the scent of the
contents.In order to recycle the bottles, accordingly, it is
necessary that the bottles have small adsorption of the
substances having a taste or a scent, i.e, excellent non-adsorptivity,
and have high heat resistance capable of
withstanding filling of high-temperature liquids which have
been subjected to heat sterilization after washing.
Further, also necessary is that the attached substances or
the adsorbates are completely removed from the bottles.The present inventors have earnestly studied to solve
such problems associated with the prior art technique as
mentioned above, and as a result, they have found that a
bottle made of a specific polyester and having a high mean
crystallinity at the bottle body is excellent in non-adsorptivity
and heat resistance. They have also found
that if the bottle having a high mean crystallinity at the
bottle body is held in air or brought into contact with
water or water vapor of a specific temperature, the
adsorbates on the bottle can be rapidly desorbed. Based on
these findings, the present invention has been
accomplished.Accordingly, an object of the invention is to
provide a refillable polyester bottle which is excellent
in non-adsorbtivity and heat resistance, and a method of
removing adsorbates on the polyester bottle for the
purpose of recycling the bottle.The
