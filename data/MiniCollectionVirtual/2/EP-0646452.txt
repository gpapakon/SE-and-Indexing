<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making foam plastic mouldings from scrap parts (reject mouldings) of open-cell foam plastics. The scrap parts are comminuted into flakes, which are mixed with binder and hardener to form a pourable composition, which is introduced into a mould, compressed and steam-treated.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing foam moldings which
comprises the following steps:


a) pieces of open-cell melamine resin foam waste
with a density of from 5 to 100 g/l are

comminuted to give flakes,
b) a free-flowing material is prepared from 100
parts by weight of the foam flakes

from 5 to 50 parts by weight of a curable
melamine resin, urea resin or phenolic resin as

binder

from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of an acid as
curing agent for the binder and

from 5 to 50 parts by weight of water,
c) the free-flowing material is placed into a closed
mold which has at least one moveable mold wall

and equipment for introducing steam into the
mold,
d) the free-flowing material is compressed in the
mold to a density of from 15 to 120 g/l,
e) steam at above 100°C is blown into the mold, and
as a result the compressed material becomes set

as the binder cures, to give a molding,
f) the molding is removed from the mold and annealed
at above 180°C.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
open-cell plastic foam is composed of a melamine-formaldehyde

condensation product which has been rendered
resilient.
