<ABSTRACT>
A contact housing for coupling to a coaxial cable (1) comprises a housing (5) of electrically conducting material and constituting coupling means for the screen (3) of the coaxial cable (1), and a therefrom insulated (7) particular coupling means (6), the centre conductor of the contact housing (5), for electrically conducting coupling to the centre conductor (2) of the coaxial cable (1). One has aimed at designing the contact housing such that it upon insignificant modifications can be coupled together with coaxial cables of mutually differing cross-sectional dimensions. To this end, the centre conductor coupling means (6) of the contact housing (5) has been formed to be capable of being brought into firmly retaining, electrical contact with the centre conductor (2) of the coaxial cable (1), and which cooperates with a locking means (9) for locking the connection established, the contact housing (5) being assigned a locking sleeve (11) of electrically conducting material, and which can be connected firmly with the contact housing (5), said locking sleeve (11) being adapted to cooperate with knife contacts (10, 10'; 14, 14') having varying width extent laterally of the axis of the locking sleeve (11), and the width thereof being adjusted to the cross-sectional dimension of the coaxial cable (1) concerned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector comprising a contact housing for 
coupling to coaxial cables having varying cross-sectional 
dimension, the housing being of electrically conducting 
material and constituting coupling means for the screen or 
shield of the coaxial cable, and a therefrom insulated, 
particular coupling means, the centre conductor coupling 
means, for electrically conducting coupling to the centre 
conductor of the coaxial cable. As well known, the conductor of a coaxial cable is 
positioned centrically within the cable and insulated from 
a conducting screen or shield surrounded by the external 
insulation. With such a coupling, cable nut and locking disc are 
threaded, as known per se, into the coaxial cable prior to 
the external jacket being scraped off over a length of about 
3 - 4 cm. The screen or shield is cut about 9 cm from the 
end of the external jacket, and the screen sleeve is 
threaded in until it stops against the end face of the 
external jacket. Thereafter, the strands of the screen are 
splintered and folded back over the screen sleeve. The 
centre conductor is cut at 5,5 mm and is stripped of 
insulation, such that the insulation becomes 3,5 mm and 
stripped centre conductor 2 mm. The foil screen can overlap 
the dielectric by about 2 mm. Prior to the coaxial cable 
being mounted, the centre conductor point is threaded into  
 
an insulation piece and conducted into the contact housing. 
A centre sleeve is threaded over the centre conductor which 
is mounted to the contact housing and screwed into place 
by means of a wrench or an adjustable spanner. Thereafter, 
the centre conductor point is soldered to an electrically 
conducting portion of the contact housing. Prior art contact housings of this general kind are only in 
a position to be coupled to a coaxial cable of one 
particular dimension, and the soldering represents a 
considerable problem with respect to fault finding in order 
to determine whether the soldering is poor. As a result of 
the soldering, but also due to other factors, the way of 
mounting is cumbersome and time-consuming. Improved contact housings 
distinguish themselves through more suitable centre 
conductor coupling means and cooperating locking means 
therefore, see EP-412412. A resilient attachment of the 
centre conductor of a coaxial cable in such a contact 
housing is known from US-4 892 491. According to the present invention one has aimed at 
providing a connector comprising a contact housing for coupling to coaxial cables

<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising a contact housing for coupling to coaxial cables (1) of 
varying cross-sectional dimension, the housing (5) being of 

electrically conducting material and constituting coupling 
means for the screen or shield (3) of the coaxial cable (1), 

and a therefrom insulated (7) particular coupling means (6) for 
electrically conducting coupling to the centre conductor (2) of 

the coaxial cable (1) ; and a 
locking sleeve (11) of electrically conducting material, which can be 

connected firmly with the contact housing (5), said locking 
sleeve (11) being adapted to accommodate and cooperate interlockingly 

with knife contacts (10, 10') being interchangeable 
against other knife contacts (14, 14') of different width extent 

laterally of the axis of the locking sleeve (11) and said 
width being adapted to the cross-sectional dimension of 

the coaxial cable (1) concerned. 
A connector as set forth in claim 1,
characterized in
 that the centre conductor 
coupling means (6) is firmly mounted on a spring-loaded (8) insulation 

body (7) displaceably suspended in the direction of 
the axis of the former, and which at all times seeks to urge 

the centre conductor coupling means (6) towards the operative 
position in engagement with the centre conductor (2).
