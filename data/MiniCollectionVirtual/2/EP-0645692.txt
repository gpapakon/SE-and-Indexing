<ABSTRACT>
Upon selection of an application/process on a computer 
system, an input device is appropriately 

mapped/remapped to correspond to the language selected by 
a user. Thus, a user can switch from one language in a 

first application to another language in a second application 
without having to change the entire system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to computer software, 
and in particular to a method and apparatus for automatically 
reconfiguring a keyboard input device to support the 
appropriate language when moving from application to application 
on a desktop. As is well known, there are many different languages 
and alphabets in existence and currently in use around the 
world. Languages are not specific to one particular country 
and many countries use multiple languages. For example, 
Switzerland has three official languages with 65% of 
the population speaking German, 18% French, and 12% Italian. 
The remaining population speaks other languages, 
with English being a widely used additional language. 
Also, Canada uses both French and English as official 
languages; Belgium has a split of 55% Dutch, 40% French, 
and 5% German again, with English being a widely used 
additional language. In countries where multiple languages 
are used, it is often necessary to switch from one 
computer application to another in which separate languages 
are used. Currently, there is no facility to automatically 
change the keyboard input language to match the 
application language when a user moves from one application 
in a first language to a second application in a 
second language. In a windowing application, a multi-lingual user must 
manually request a remapping of the keyboard for the entire  
 
system each time they move to a window which contains 
text in a different language. For example, a user in 
Canada may well have multiple applications running, with 
some of the applications being in French and others in 
English. Multi-lingual code pages of operating systems 
support both these languages as far as the display of text 
is concerned. If the user is looking at an English application, 
the keyboard is set to receive English as input. 
If the user moves to the French application they must 
interrupt their session and issue a systems command which 
sets the entire system to receive French characters as 
input. Going back to an English application again causes 
the user to do a manual reset. Thus, there is a need for a 
method and apparatus to automatically reconfigure a keyboard 
input device to support the appropriate language 
when switching from application to application. The present invention provides a method and apparatus 
for automatically remapping an input device of a computer 
system which substantially reduces or eliminates the problems 
associated with the prior art. The present invention 
allows a

<CLAIMS>
A method of automatically remapping a computer system 
input device to correspond to a language of an application/process 

selected for use, comprising the steps of: 
building a language/input device/process table; 

designating for said table an appropriate language for at 
least one process/application available for use on the 

system; and 
automatically remapping the input device upon selection of 

said at least one process/application for current use. 
The method of Claim 1, further comprising the step of: 
changing said appropriate language for said at least one 

process/application upon selection of a change input device 
request. 
The method of Claim 1, further comprising the step of: 
storing said appropriate language designation in said 

table for recurring use. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein said step of designating 
comprises: 

selecting a language and keyboard map from a list. 
The method of Claim 1, wherein said step of automatically 
remapping includes the step of: 

reading said designation in said table for said process/application. 
A computer system for automatically remapping an input 
device to correspond to a language of an application/process 

selected for use, comprising: 
means for building a language/input device/process table; 

means for designating for said table an appropriate language 
for at least one process/application available for 

use on the system; and 
means for automatically remapping the input device upon 

selection of said at least one process/application for 
current use. 
The computer system of Claim 6, further comprising: 
means for changing said appropriate language for said at 

least one process/application upon selection of a change 
input device request. 
The computer system of Claim 6, further comprising: 
means for storing said appropriate designation in said 

table for recurring use. 
The computer system of Claim 6, wherein said means for 
designating comprises: 

means for selecting a language and keyboard map from a 
list. 
The computer system of Claim 6, wherein said means for 
automatically remapping comprises: 

means for reading said designation in said table for said 
process/application.
