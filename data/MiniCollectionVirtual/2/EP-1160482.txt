<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic spring structure and a vibration relief
mechanism capable of being simplified in construction and

manufactured at a reduced cost as compared with the prior
art. A magnetic spring structure includes a plurality of

stationary magnets (12,13) which are arranged adjacently to each
other so as to define a gap therebetween and in a manner

to render magnetic poles thereof opposite to each other,
and a movable element (14) made of a magnetic material and

arranged in the gap. The movable element (14) is urged in a
direction parallel to a direction of magnetization of the

stationary magnets by an action of a magnetic field generated
by the stationary magnets. The stationary magnets (12,13) and

movable element arranged in such predetermined positional
relationship provide a magnetic circuit structure, which

may be solely used as a damping apparatus. Also, it may
have a whole spring constant obtained by combination thereof

with a cushioning member such as a metal spring, rubber
or the like falsely set to be substantially zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic spring structure and a vibration relief mechanism having the magnetic spring structure incorporated therein, and more particularly to a magnetic spring structure and a vibration relief mechanism suitable for incorporation into a vibration relief structure for a suspension unit used in a seat for a conveyance such as an automobile, an electric car or a ship, an engine mount, or the like.A variety of damping materials, dampers and control techniques have been conventionally proposed as measures to counter vibration and noise for a machine or a structure which is typically constructed of a material reduced in internal damping in order to ensure rigidity thereof.Damage to a human body and a nervous system due to exposure of the human body to vibration has been in question with an increase in speed of a conveyance. Such damage is expressed in the form of symptoms such as fatigue, headache, stiffness of shoulders, lumbago, amblyopia and the like. In general, vibration isolation is attained using any optimum combination between a spring and a damping material which are selected from the group consisting of a metal spring, an air spring, rubber, a viscoelastic material and a damper. However, such a combination causes dynamic magnification and a loss factor to be contrary to each other. More particularly, a reduction in dynamic magnification for the purpose of improving low-frequency characteristics causes a spring formed to be reduced in loss factor, resulting in the spring being hard. An increase in loss factor to improve high-frequency characteristics leads to a spring increased in dynamic magnification like a damping material, so that the spring is rendered disadvantageously soft to a degree of deteriorating low-frequency characteristics. In view of the fact, many attempts are made in the art which are directed to suppression of vibration using a passive damper including a dynamic vibration reducer or by semiactive control or active control.Under such circumstances, there is recently proposed a damping apparatus including a magnetic spring structure. Also, there is proposed a vibration relief mechanism which is constructed so as to permit a whole spring constant thereof to be set to be falsely substantially zero by incorporation of a damping member such as a metal spring, a rubber material or the like into such a magnetic spring structure. However, the vibration relief mechanism proposed causes an increase in manufacturing cost and complication in construction. Thus, it
