<ABSTRACT>
A method of improving the stability and broadening the range of pH stability of an aqueous solution of from about 0.001 % to 5 % by weight of a water soluble organosilane containing hydrolyzable groups such as methyltrimethoxysilane, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propylmethyldi(decyl) ammonium chloride by the use of 0.05 % to 10 % by weight of a water soluble organic quaternary ammonium compound having at least one nitrogen-bonded hydrocarbon group of at least 8 carbon atoms and being free of silicon atoms, such as benzalkonium chloride, along with from about 0.5 % to 30 % by weight of at least one surfactant selected from the group consisting of nonionic, amphoteric sarcosine anionic, and cationic surfactants other than the water soluble quaternary ammonium compounds. The pH of the solution can be adjusted to from about 1 to about 13.5 with a suitable acid or base. The resulting stable aqueous solutions are useful for depositing the water soluble organosilane on a variety of substrates to, among other things, serve as coupling agents, waterproofing agents and to render substrates antimicrobial and algicidal depending upon the nature of the organosilane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This Application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 
07/657,017 filed on February 15, 1991. This invention relates to a method of improving the 
stability and broadening the range of pH stability of an 
aqueous solution of a water soluble organosilane containing 
silicon-bonded hydrolyzable groups, particularly water 
soluble quaternary ammonium functional organosilanes, by the 
addition of a water soluble organic non-silicon quaternary 
ammonium compound and at least one of nonionic, amphoteric, 
sarcosine anionic, and certain types of cationic surfactants 
as well as to the stabilized solutions themselves. Water soluble organosilanes containing silicon-bonded 
hydrolyzable groups such as alkoxysilanes have a number of 
uses. The hydrolyzable groups enable such compounds to 
permanently attach themselves to substrates containing 
hydroxyl or other silicon-reactive groups. These 
organosilanes can be used in waterproofing cement, brick and 
mortar as well as to provide a further reactive group bonded 
to various substrates to enable that substrate to be dyed or 
painted or else to render the substrate antimicrobial or 
algicidal, among other things, depending upon the nature of 
the remaining silicon-bonded reactive groups which are not 
hydrolyzable. For ecological reasons, it is more desirable to deliver 
such organosilanes to a substrate from a substantially 
aqueous medium which contains as few solvents as possible. 
Organosilanes are often used as coupling agents to improve 
the bonding of fillers to resins such as the unsaturated 
polyester resins used to make fiberglass boats, shower stalls 
and the like and can be applied from aqueous solutions. Page 
58 of a brochure from Petrarch Systems of Bristol, PA, 
entitled "Silicon Compounds, Register & Review", 1987, states 
that the stability of aqueous silane solutions varies from 
hours for the simple alkyl silanes to weeks for the 
aminosilanes. It states that the alkoxysilane is dissolved  
 
at 0.5 - 2.0% concentration in water. For less soluble 
silanes, 0.1% of a nonionic surfactant is added just prior to 
addition of the silane so that an emulsion rather than a 
solution is formed. Further comments on the instability in water of 
organosilanes containing hydrolyzable groups are found in "A 
Guide to Dow Corning Silane Coupling Agents", Dow Corning 
Corporation, Midland, MI, Form No. 23-012B-85 (1985) on pages 
6-7 teaching that self-condensation of the silanol form of 
the organosilane coupling agent to form siloxane polymers is
