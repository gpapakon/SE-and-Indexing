<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed whereby cells having a desired function are seeded on and into biocompatible, biodegradable or non-degradable polymer scaffolding, previously implanted in a patient and infiltrated with blood vessels and connective tissue, to produce a functional organ equivalent. The resulting organoid is a chimera formed of parenchymal elements of the donated tissue and vascular and matrix elements of the host. The matrix should be a non-toxic, injectable porous template for vascular ingrowth. The pore size, usually between approximately 100 and 300 microns, should allow vascular and connective tissue ingrowth throughout approximately 10 to 90 % of the matrix, and the injection of cells such as hepatocytes without damage to the cells or patient. The introduced cells attach to the connective tissue and are fed by the blood vessels. Immediately prior to polymer implantation portacaval shunts can be created to provide trophic stimulatory factors to the implants to enhance replication and function.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally in the field of medicine and cell 
culture, and in particular in the area of implantable organs formed on 
biocompatible artificial matrices. Loss of organ function can result from congenital defects, 
injury or disease. Many times treatment with drugs or surgery is not 
in itself sufficient and the patient dies or is severely disabled. One 
approach for treatment has been to transplant donor organs or tissue 
into the patient. Drugs such as cyclosporin can be used to prevent 
tissue rejection. However, there is a tremendous shortage of donor 
organs, most of which must come from a recently deceased individual. There have been a number of attempts to culture 
dissociated tissue and implant the cells directly into the body. For 
example, transplantation of pancreatic tissue, either as a whole organ 
or as a segment of an organ, into the diabetic patient has been 
attempted. Serum glucose appears to be controlled in a more 
physiological manner using this technique and the progression of 
complications is thereby slowed. An earlier approach which was not 
successful in achieving long-term benefits was the transplantation of 
islet cells through injection of isolated clusters of islet cells into the 
portal circulation, with implantation in the vascular bed of the liver. 
More recent methods have included encapsulation of pancreatic beta 
cells to prevent immune attack by the host and injection of fetal beta 
cells beneath the capsule of the kidney. Although there is evidence of 
short term function, long term results have been less satisfactory 
(D.E.R. Sutherland, Diabetologia 20, 161-185 (1981); D.E.R.  
 
Sutherland, Diabetologia 20,435-500 (1981)). Currently whole organ 
pancreatic transplantation is the preferred treatment. One of the problems with implanting dissociated cells into 
the body is that they do not form three dimensional structures and the 
cells are lost by phagocytosis and attrition. One approach to 
overcome this problem is described by U.S. Patent No. to Lim, 
wherein cells are encapsulated within spheres, then implanted. While 
this method can sometimes maintain viable functioning cells, the cells 
do not form organs or structures and rarely result in long term 
survival and replication of the encapsulated cells. Most cells have a 
requirement for attachment to a surface in order to replicate and to 
function. The first attempts to culture cells on a matrix for use as 
artificial skin, which requires formation of a thin three dimensional 
structure, were
