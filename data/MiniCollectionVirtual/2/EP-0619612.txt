<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device with a bipolar transistor formed in a layer of 
semiconductor material (2) provided on an insulating substrate (1), in which material a 

collector zone (4), a base zone (5), and an emitter zone (6) are provided below a strip 
of insulating material (3) situated on the layer (2), which zones are connected to contact 

regions (7, 8, 9, 10) lying adjacent the strip (3), three of the contact regions (8, 9, 10) 
lying next to one another at a same side of the strip (3), of which two (8 and 9) are 

connected to the base zone (5) while the third (10), which lies between the former two 
(8 and 9), is connected to the emitter zone (6). The three contact regions (8, 9, 10) 

situated next to another at the same side of the strip (3) are provided alternately in the 
layer of semiconductor material (2) and in a further layer of semiconductor material 

(19) extending up to the strip (3). The three contact regions (8, 9, 10) connected to the 
base zone (5) and the emitter zone (6) may be provided with mutual interspacings which 

are smaller than the details which can be realised in a photoresist layer by means of the 

photolithographic process to be used in the manufacture of the transistor. As a result, 
the transistor can be manufactured with a very small extrinsic base.
