<ABSTRACT>
The present invention offers a method of measuring the
activity of tested substances utilizing the reconstituted plasma

kallikrein-kinin system.
A series of enzymatic reactions is started wherein an activation
of a blood coagulation factor XII is an initiating reachtion

in the presence of the tested substance in a reconstituted
plasma kallikrein-kinin system, then the reaction is stopped and

the physiologically active substance produced in said reaction is
quantitatively determined.
In the measuring method of the activity according to the
present invention, the real activity (a promoting or inhibiting

ability) of the tested substance against the production of the
produced physiologically active substance can be easily, simply,

quickly and precisely measured by a reaction system wherein the
contaminating other factors are substantially removed. Accordingly,

the method of measuring the activity in accordance with
the present invention can be a very advantageous means for determining

the action which is useful for adjusting the bioregulations
in, for example, the plasma kallikrein-kinin system, the blood clotting

system, the fibrinolusis system, etc. and also for developing such
drugs.

<DESCRIPTION>
(EP-A-0 259 857) discloses a method for assaying physiologically active substances based
on the measurement of the extent of conversion of plasma prekallikrein to kallikrein upon
addition of an activator of the blood coagulation Factor XII to an animal plasma sample in the
presence of a drug to be tested.(EP-A-0 078 764) discloses a method for quantitative determination of Factor XII in human
plasma based on measurements of the enzymatic activity of activated Factor XII (Factor
XIIa) upon addition of an activator to a human plasma sample in the presence of a suitable
substrate.(US-A-4,882,272) discloses an assay to determine the amount of high molecular weight
kininogen (HMWK) in a human plasma sample using activated Factor XI (Factor XIa) as
substrate. The activation of Factor XI proceeds upon addition of a known amount of
exogenous Factor XIIa to a sample containing inhibited endogeneous plasma prekallikrein
and kallikrein. Concentrations of exogenous Factor XIIa and Factor XI in the sample are
selected such as that the concentration of functional HMWK in the sample is rate-limiting in
the HMWK-mediated activation of Factor XI by Factor XIIa. The present invention relates to a method of measuring the
activity of a tested substance to the production of a physiologically
active substance produced in a reconstituted plasma
kallikrein-kinin system. More particularly, it relates to a
method of measuring a physiologically active substance produced
in said reaction system - such as a blood coagulation factor XII
in an active form, plasma kallikrein,or bradykinin - utilizing a
reconstituted system comprising the components of plasma kallikrein-kinin
system.Kallikrein is a protease which is widely distributed in
plasma and tissues of various animals including human beings and
an enzymatic system called a kallikrein-kinin system has been
known. The kallikrein-kinin system acts in vivo having a close
relationship with various other enzymatic reaction systems such
as a renin-angiotensin system, a blood clotting system, a fibrinolysis
system, a complement system as well as catecholamine and
arachidonic acid cascades mainly related to prostaglandins, leukotrienes
and thromboxanes. Accordingly, the kallikrein-kinin
system is closely related to blood pressure regulating action,
action through the blood clotting-fibrinolysis-complement system
or bioregulation, and the improving action for peripheral circulation
by various physiologically active substances produced by
an arachidonic acid cascade and plays an important
