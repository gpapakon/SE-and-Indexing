<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for centralised management of the electrical switching of an installation (2). This method is characterised in that the relative voltage variations ( DELTA V/V) at the terminals of the installation (2) caused by turning on or turning off an appliance (1, 5, 7) of the installation are detected and measured (11), a count is made of the switchings and the result is stored in an accumulator counter (17), the result of the counting is compared with prerecorded values (21), it is determined whether the switching is within authorised limits, so as to refuse a non-priority switching if the number of switchings carried out is equal to or greater than the number of allowable switchings, and to allow this switching in the opposite case.

Method of centralized management of the electric commutations of an 
installation (2), characterized in that it comprises the steps consisting in: 


detecting and measuring the relative variations in voltage (Δ V/V) at the 
terminals of the installation (2), provoked by the starting up or stopping of an 

apparatus (1, 5, 7) thereof, 
counting the commutations provoking the different variations in voltage 
and storing the result of such counting in a meter-accumulator (17), 
comparing the result of counting with pre-recorded values establishing the 
number of commutations as a function of the variation in voltage at the terminals 

of the installation, 
determining whether one is in an authorized zone of commutation, so as 
to refuse a non-priority commutation if the number of commutations made is 

equal to or greater than the number of commutations admissible, and to allow 
such commutation in the opposite case. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that a weighting of the 
commutations is effected, which is a function of the magnitude of the measured 

relative variation of the voltage (Δ V/V), this weighted value being stored in the 
meter-accumulator (17). 
Method according to either one of the preceding Claims, characterized in 
that several commutations are cumulated, being effected at zero voltage. 
Device for the centralized management of the electric commutations of an 
installation (2), characterized in that it comprises: 


means (11) for detecting and measuring the relative variations in voltage at 
the terminals of the installation (2) provoked by the starting up or stopping of an 

apparatus (1, 5, 7) thereof,  
 
means for counting and storing the number of commutations made by the 
installation (2), in a meter-accumulator (17), 
means (21) for storing the desired maximum number of the commutations 
made in the installation (2) as a function of said variations in voltage, 
comparison means (19) which compare the number of commutations made 
with that of the commutations admissible during said given period, so as to refuse 

a non-priority commutation if the number of commutations made is equal to or 
greater than the number of commutations admissible, and to allow such commutation 

in the opposite case. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in that it comprises means (15) 
for weighting the relative voltage variations measured at the terminals of the 

installation (2) and for storing, in the storage means (17), the result of such 
weighting. 
Device according to one of Claims 4 or 5, characterized in that it comprises 
means ensuring one or more commutations simultaneously at zero voltage. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that the commutation means 
are constituted by a triac.
