<ABSTRACT>
A slip rate at a time when a wheel deceleration 
corresponding to the difference between the road-surface 

reactive torque and the braking torque has become greater 
than or equal to a predetermined value set on the basis of a 

vehicle deceleration is computed. An offset amount between 
the slip rate computed on the basis of the wheel 

deceleration and a targeted slip rate at which a coefficient 
of braking friction becomes maximum is computed. A wheel 

speed at the targeted slip rate is calculated as a targeted 
wheel speed on the basis of the calculated slip rate, the 

calculated offset amount, and a vehicle speed. Then, the 
braking torque of the wheel is controlled such that the 

wheel speed becomes equal to the targeted wheel speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-lock 
controller, and more particularly to an anti-lock controller 
for improving the safety of a vehicle by preventing a wheel 
from becoming locked when brakes are applied to the vehicle. If a brake pedal or the like is operated during the 
traveling of the vehicle, the braking torque of a magnitude 
corresponding to the amount of the pedal or the like 
operated is applied to the wheels by a braking device such 
as a hydraulic braking device. The wheel speed (the 
rotating speed of the wheel) becomes lower than the vehicle 
speed due to this braking torque (undergoes so-called slip), 
so that sliding friction occurs between the wheel and the 
road surface. This sliding friction serves as a braking 
force, and the vehicle is thereby decelerated or brought to 
a standstill. The slip rate which represents the degree of 
slip is defined by the following Formula (1) if it is 
assumed that a vehicle speed is VGS, and that a wheel speed 
is VW:  
 
Slip rate S = VGS-VWVGS × 100 [%] The braking force is dependent upon a coefficient of 
braking friction µ (hereafter simply referred to as "µ") 
acting between the wheel and the road surface, and µ changes 
in correspondence with the slip rate S. On dry asphalt, for 
example, µ changes substantially in proportion to the slip 
rate S when the slip rate is low, as shown in Fig. 1A, and µ 
reaches a peak (the braking force also reaches a peak) when 
the slip rate S is at a predetermined value (generally, 8 to 
30% or thereabouts; SR shown in Fig. 1A). If a still higher 
braking torque is applied and the slip rate S exceeds the 
predetermined value SR, µ declines (and the braking force 
also declines correspondingly). With a decline in µ, the 
braking force declines, which results in an increase in the 
braking distance, a substantial decline in the cornering 
force of the tire due to the slip rate, and the like. 
Hence, the stability of the vehicle declines. Then, if a 
higher braking torque is applied, the wheel becomes locked 
(slip rate S = 1), thereby resulting in the loss of the 
directional stability and steerability of the vehicle. To prevent the wheel from becoming locked during the 
braking of the vehicle and bring the vehicle to a standstill 
in a short braking distance, anti-lock controllers, i.e., 
anti-lock braking systems, of various arrangements have  
 
hitherto been proposed. For example, there has been 
proposed an anti-lock controller in which a slip rate at 
which µ reaches a peak is fixedly set in advance
