<ABSTRACT>
The mount is formed by at least two sheets (1-2) of 
transparent plastic material and an optional opaque 

intermediate sheet (3), all of quadrilateral shape, with 
bevelled corners, fixed to each other along part of their 

perimeter so that they form one or two back-to-back pockets 
of such a size that they hold with a sufficient margin a 

photograph with either a horizontal or a vertical 
disposition, the said pocket or pockets being provided for 

this purpose with apertures (10-11) on two consecutive 
sides, through which the photographs can be inserted into 

the mount with the necessary orientation to enable them to 
be correctly viewed from a fixed observation point without 

the necessity of rotating the mount. The mount is provided 
with internal welds (12) which ensure correct centring and 

retention of the photographs in the mount, regardless of 
their orientation. The opaque intermediate sheet (3) is 

preferably of any suitable colour contrasting with the 
photographs and has a rough surface to keep the photographs 

in place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the mounts for 
photograph albums. There are known mounts for photograph albums formed from 
transparent sheets of weldable plastic material, welded to 
each other at their edges to form pockets with sizes 
suitable for containing one or two photographs back-to-back. 
In the mounts of the above type, the pockets for containing 
the photographs vary in size according to the format of the 
photographs, and are open on one side only, generally on a 
short side, and therefore the photograph has to be inserted 
into the pocket with a certain disposition, even if it 
should be orientated differently in order to be seen 
correctly without the necessity of rotating the album. It is the scope of the present invention to provide a 
mount for photograph albums which avoids to the drawbacks 
and disadvantages of the known prior art mounts. According to the invention a mount for a photograph 
album is provided, having at least on pocket with 
dimensions in a plan view sufficient to contain at least one 
photograph with either a horizontal disposition or a 
vertical disposition, the said pocket being open on two 
consecutive sides to form two apertures, at an angle of 90° 
to each other, through wich the photograph can be inserted  
 
into the pocket with a horizontal disposition or a vertical 
disposition as required. According to another feature of the invention, the mount 
is further provided with suitable internal welds, which 
ensure the correct centring and retention of the photograph 
in the pocket or pockets of the mount, independently of the 
orientation of the photograph. Advantageously, each mount is preferably formed from 
three superimposed sheets of suitable plastic material, the 
outer ones of which are transparent, while the intermediate 
sheet is opaque, has a colour such that it forms an 
effective perimetric contrast for the photograph, and has 
its surfaces suitably rough to retain the photographs in the 
mount. When looking through a photograph album made with mounts 
according to the invention, it is possible to correctly view 
the photographs with horizontal disposition or with vertical 
disposition, without the necessity of rotating the album as 
is the case in the known art. Further characteristics of the mount according to the 
invention, and the advantages derived therefrom, will be 
evident from the following description made with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, in which 
Figure 1 is a top plan view of a mount according to the 
invention.  Figure 2

<CLAIMS>
A transparent mount for photograph album, comprising 
two sheets (1-2) of transparent plastic material, 

superimposed and welded together along part of their 
perimeter, to form at least one pocket for containing one or 

two back-to-back photographs which are visible through the 
transparent walls of the pocket, characterized by the fact 

that the said pockets are of a size in plan view such as to 
contain with a sufficient play a photograph with either a 

horizontal or a vertical disposition, the said pockets being 
open on two consecutive sides to form two apertures (10-11), 

at an angle of 90° to each other through which the 
photograph can be inserted into the pocket with the correct 

orientation for its correct viewing. 
A mount according to Claim 1, further comprising a 
third intermediate sheet (3) welded to the two outer 

transparent sheets (1,2) the said intermediate sheet (3) 
being made of opaque material, and having a colour 

contrasting with the photographs. 
A mount according to Claim 1, in which the said 
apertures (10, 11) are preferably disposed on the outwardly 

directed side and on the top directed side of the mount. 
A mount according to Claim 2, in which the said 
intermediate sheet (3) is provided with a roughened and/or 

decorated surface. 
A mount according to preceding claims, characterized 
in that, in the areas of the external angles of the 

hypothetical intersection of two photographs (F-F') 
differently orientated horizontally or vertically in the 

mount, there are provided welds (12-112), having any 
suitable shape and extension, which affect all the sheets of 

the mount, and which have the function fo centring the 
photograph in the mount, regardless of whether it is 

inserted horizontally or vertically, and of stably retaining 
the photograph in the orientation with which it was inserted 

into the mount. 
A mount according to Claim 5, in which the welds (12) 
are of annular, rounded form and also form an effective 

guide for the correct insertion of the photograph into the 
said pocket or pockets. 
A mount according to Claim 5, in which the welds 
(112) are of linear or substantially V-shaped form, with the 

corner areas rounded, and reach the apertures (10-11) of the 
pocket or pockets of the mount, with a precise divergence 

towards the outside, to form an effective guide for the 
correct insertion of the photograph into the said pocket or 

pockets. 
A mount according to preceding claims, characterized 
in that it has a square or rectangular form in plan view, 

with the corner areas (4-104-204-304) bevelled or rounded 
and preferably welded, the support being welded on two 

consecutive sides (5-6) and on the side intended to be 
 

jointed in a book with other identical mounts and with a 
cover to form the album, the mount being provided at equal 

distances from the side (5) with at least one pair of holes 
(7), preferably with their edges welded and/or circumscribed 

by a weld, by means of which the mount is engaged on the 
openable rings (108) of a binder clamp of a known type (8) 

fixed on the inner face of the spine of the cover. 
A mount according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
it is provided with a weld line (9) parallel to the side (5) 

with which the said mount is prepared for hinging in book 
form with the other mounts to form the album, this line 

being spaced from the corresponding parallel aperture (10) 

of the pocket by a distance substantially equal to the 
distance between the other aperture (11) of the pocket and 

the welded side (6) parallel to it.
