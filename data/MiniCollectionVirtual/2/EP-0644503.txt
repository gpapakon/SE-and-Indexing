<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to read bar codes (5) applied to the circumference of sample bottles (4) which are arranged in a row one after another in a stand (3), the stand (3) with the sample bottles (4) is moved in a stepwise fashion, via a guide track (8), past a reading head (20) which is arranged in a stationary position. After each step, the bottle (4) is rotated about its own axis, so that the reading head can read the bar code (5). The rotary movement is carried out by means of a magnetic, driven rotary disc (17), which is supported in a slide (12) which can be slid from the side under the bottom (6), consisting of ferromagnetic material, of the bottle (4).
