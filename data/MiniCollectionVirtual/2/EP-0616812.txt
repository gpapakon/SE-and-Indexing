<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a combination comprising an anti-hormonal compound 
and a binding molecule specifically binding a c-erb B-2 protein wherein the 

binding molecule may induce inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.
 

The combination of the invention may be used as medicament for a therapeutic 
application for treating cancer, wherein the anti-hormonal compound and the 

binding molecule are administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to anti-hormonal compounds which are used in
combination with a further compound, like anti - c-erb B-2 antibodies (binding
molecules). Additionally the invention refers to the use of the combination of
the anti-hormonal compound and the second compound for the manufacture of
a medicament for treatment of cancer. Further the invention refers to the
process of manufacturing of the combination. Further, the invention refers to
the process of administering the combination.A variety of tumors have been characterised as being responsive to anti-hormonal
therapies, among them breast, ovarian, and prostate. Anti-hormonal
therapy has met with success in many patients, however, because anti-hormonal
agents are cytostatic (i.e. they inhibit growth) rather than cytotoxic
they must be given to patients for an extended period of time.Oncogenes and their products appear to be associated with the transformation
of cells to malignancy. Many of the oncogenes thus far identified have
properties of cell-surface growth factor receptors. Tyrosine kinases such as
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and c-erb B-2 are two well known
examples.While many of these oncogene proteins are present on the surface of some
normal cells the amplification of the oncogene or overexpression of protein
product has been shown to correlate with tumorgenic phenotype. In fact, the
amplification of the c-erb B2 oncogene indicates a very poor clinical prognosis,
especially in breast and ovarian cancer (Slamon et al. (1987) Science 235: 177;
Slamon et al. (1989) Science 244: 707). The relative roles of both hormones and growth factors in the development and
persistence of cancer are not well understood. The scientific literature
describes conflicting results and theories. Several studies into the relationship
between hormones and the putative growth factor receptor c-erb B-2 have
indicated an inverse relationship between the presence of hormone receptors
and the expression of c-erb B-2 in tumor cells. (See for example Beckmann et
al. (1992) European Journal of Cancer 28: 322-326; Berns et al. (1992)
European Journal of Cancer 28: 697 - 700). Mizukami et al., tested the
effects of hormones and hormone antagonists on the expression of the c-erb B-2
protein in the tumor cell line MCF-7 (expressing low levels of c-erb B-2
protein) in an in vivo assay in mice. A progesterone antagonist
(medroxyprogesterone acetate) and an oestrogen antagonist (tamoxifen) both
reduced the levels of c-erb B-2 protein and decreased cellular
