<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED GLOSSY COATING FOR FRIED AND BAKED FOODSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONConsumers develop preferences for particular types of fo based on appearance and texture. Once they grow accustomed glossy appearances and textures in, for example/ sauce-coated fri or baked chicken/ they come to expect and demand that the characteristics be present in all sauce-coated fried or bak chicken.Such glossy appearances and textures have typically be provided in the prior art by the application of liquid-bas glazes. The use of such glazes is labor intensive/ since t glazes must be carefully applied to avoid waste and mess fr dripping and splattering both during initial application and wh the coated substrate is heated to set the glaze. Additionall such glazes contain water which means that users must pay f shipping water, an uneconomical practice which is avoided whenev possible in the low -margin food industry.Therefore, it would be highly desireable to provide a new w of producing long-lasting glossy coatings on fried and baked foo which are easy to apply and free of water, and which can deliv a wide range of different flavors along with the desired appearan and textural characteristics. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to food coatings and, mo particularly, to a new coating and treatment method for fried a baked foods which provides a long-lasting glossy appearance a associated desireable textural and flavor characteristics. Th invention also relates to fried and baked foods bearing the n coating.The coating comprises a dry blend of a minimum of thr ingredients in specific weight ratios, as described below. T blend is applied in its dry form to the chicken or other fo substrate shortly after frying or baking, so that the hot moistu brought up to the surface of the fried or baked product wi solubilize the dry blend/ producing the desired glossy appearan and, as a side benefit/ helping to retain external moisture juiciness in the product as well as texture. The dry blend may used with other ingredients for flavoring the chicken.The actual quantity of the blend which is to be applied on particular substrate must be determined on a case-by-case basiFor example, some ingredients act as dulling or drying agents a may require adjustments in the ratios of the three components the blend to achieve the desired endproduct. 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The coating of the present invention comprises a dry blend the follqwing three ingredients: gum arabic, tapioca dextrin xantham gum. The
