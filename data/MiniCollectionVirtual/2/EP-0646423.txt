<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is disclosed for efficiently and positively 
cleaning a main piping not only totally, but also partially by 

the reciprocation of a pig. The cleaning apparatus is 
provided with a launcher (4) for projecting a pig and a 

catcher (36) for receiving the pig at both ends of a main 
piping (37). A compressed gas is supplied from a feed nozzle 

of the launcher thereby to send the pig to the catcher (36). 
In consequence to the arrival of the pig, the compressed gas 

is discharged through a discharge nozzle (29) of the catcher 
(36), when the pressure is decreased and the pig is accordingly 

stopped. The decrease of the pressure is detected by a 
pressure sensor (33) of the launcher (4). When the pig 

arrives at the catcher (36), it is detected by a pressure 
sensor (33) of the catcher (36). The compressed gas is 

supplied from a feed nozzle (22) of the catcher (36) based on 
the detecting signal of the pressure sensor (33) of the 

launcher (4), thereby to send the pig towards the launcher 
(4). The reciprocating motion of the pig is executed by opening/closing 

electromagnetic valves of the launcher (4), 
catcher (36), main piping (37) and branch pipes (41a, 41b) by 

means of a controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning 
apparatus designed to remove residues such as fats and oils, 
chemical substances, medicines and the like in a piping by 
movement of a pig. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 62-38040 
(38040/1987) discloses an example of a cleaning apparatus to 
remove residues from a piping, which includes a cylindrical 
body constituting a catcher to stop a pig projected from a 
launcher, and a separating mechanism having a jet port. In 
the cleaning apparatus, a compressed fluid is discharged 
through the jet port thereby to stop the pig and, the stopped 
pig is taken out after the cylindrical body is opened 
separately by the separating mechanism. Another example of the above type apparatus is 
described in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No. 
59-142085 (142085/1984), which is provided with a launcher and 
a catcher, wherein an outlet of a high pressure gas in the 
catcher is positioned so as to be clogged by a pig. Meanwhile, in a pig sensing apparatus revealed in 
the Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No. 62-144593  
 
(144593/1987), a sensing rod with a sensing plate at the front 
end thereof is slidably mounted in a hole formed in a blind 
patch at the end part of a piping, and a branch pipe is 
provided at the end of the piping to let out the discharged 
matter. The pig is moved only in one direction in the 
conventional apparatuses mentioned above. Therefore, not only 
the removing efficiency of residues adhered to the wall of the 
piping is poor, but also it is annoyingly necessary to take 
out the pig sent to the catcher and reload the pig in the 
launcher every time the pig is projected from the launcher, 
resulting in complication of the cleaning work. According to an apparatus disclosed in the Japanese 
Patent Laid-open Publication No. 62-87836 (87836/1987), a 
speed of pig movement is controlled to be stopped at an 
optional position. Specifically, the pig has a through-hole 
bored in the main body thereof, a valve plate for opening/closing 
the through-hole and an actuator for activating 
the valve plate. The arrangement is not advantageous, 
however, since it requires the pig of the complicate structure 
as above. On the other hand, the Japanese Patent Laid-open 
Publication No. 2-95487 (95487/1990) shows a cleaning method, 
where a plurality of pigs are inserted into a piping while a 
solvent is sealed between the pigs, thereby to clean the  
 
interior of the piping as the pigs are rushed in the piping.
