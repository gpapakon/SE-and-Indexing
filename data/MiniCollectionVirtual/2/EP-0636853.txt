<ABSTRACT>
A bullet (projectile, round) for hand-held firearms (hand guns and small arms) is disclosed, which has a cylindrical basebody (1) which is made of metal, has a front end designed as an ogive (4) and contains a blind hole (5) which is open at the front end. An additional ballistic body is inserted into the hole (5), projects beyond the front end of the basebody and is in the form of a sphere (2) which can be compressed elastically and consists of material which is resistant to impact. The hole (5) in the basebody (1) (which consists of hard tough material) contains a spherical extension (8) in its front or outer section, the radius of curvature (14) of which is less than the radius (13) of the inserted sphere.

Bullet for handguns with a cylindrical basic body (1) of metal, of 
which the front end is in the form of an ogive (4) or a frustum of a 

cone and which contains at its front end an open blind bore (5) and 
with a ballistic additional body in the form of a ball (2) inserted in 

the bore and projecting beyond the front end of the basic body,
characterised in that
 
the ball (2) is an elastic compressible ball (2) of impact-resistant 

material and that the bore (5) of the basic body (1) made of hard 
ductile material contains in its front or outer portion a part-spherical 

widening (8) of which the radius of curvature (14) is 
smaller than the radius (13) of the ball (2). 
Bullet according to claim 1, characterised in that the volume of the 
ball (2) is equal to or smaller than the space in the bore (5). 
Bullet according to claim 1, or 2, characterised in that the ball (2) 
is made of plastics such as low density polyethylene. 
Bullet according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
ball (2) is made of coloured material. 
Bullet according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
ball (2) contains particles of metal such as copper. 
Bullet according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a 
collar-shaped constriction (11) of wedge-shaped cross-section is  

 
provided at the outer end of the part-spherical widening (8) of the 

bore (5). 
Bullet according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
basic body (1) comprises a complete body made of a single 

material. 
Bullet according to one of claim 1 to 7, characterised in that the 
basic body (1) is made of copper or a copper alloy. 
Bullet according to claim 8, characterised in that the basic body (1) 
is made of a copper-zinc alloy.
