<ABSTRACT>
The connection for corrugated hoses, comprises a sealing ring at the hose end and a fixing element which holds the hose on the connection element. The last corrugation (8) of the hose (2) is elastically deformed to produce a smooth sealing surface, and is pretensioned to rest against the sealing ring. The fixing element (9) is a one-piece, closed, ring-shaped clamp with a uniform outer dia.. The clamp has an edge section (9a,9b) which can be bent radially inwards to locate over the edge of the hose.

Joint for annularly corrugated flexible tubes having a sealing ring
arranged in a terminal region of the flexible tube and having a fastening

element that engages at least indirectly around the flexible tube in the
region of the sealing ring and fixes the latter at least indirectly against an

extension element,
characterised in that

at least the last corrugation (8, 18, 28, 38, 48) of the flexible tube (2,
12, 22, 32, 42) is resiliently deformed in such a manner that it forms a

smooth sealing surface and rests, under its own bias, against the sealing
ring; the fastening element (9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59) is in the form of a

one-piece closed annular clip, the outer diameter of which is substantially
constant over the circumference, and the clip has at least one

circumferential edge region (9a, 9b, 19a, 19b, 29a, 29b, 39a, 39b, 49a,
49b, 59a, 59b) which, to form the joint, can be bent radially inwards in

such a manner that, by way of the edge region, the clip at least
indirectly engages interlockingly around the flexible tube and/or the

extension element.
Joint according to at least claim 1,
characterised in that

the clip (9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59) acts, at least indirectly, uniformly on the
flexible tube (2, 12, 22, 32, 42) and/or the extension element (3, 13,

23, 33, 43) along the entire circumference.
Joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 
the outer diameter of the clip (9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59) remains

substantially unchanged while the joint is being made.
Joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the clip (9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59) has a substantially approximately U-shaped
or V-shaped cross-section with an especially approximately

cylindrical base and two edge regions each forming the arm of a U or V,
the clip at least indirectly engaging interlockingly, by way of one (9a,

19a, 29a, 39a, 49a) of the two edge regions, around the flexible tube
and especially its deformed corrugation (8, 18, 28) and, by way of the

other edge region (9b, 19b, 29b, 39b, 49b), around the extension
element.
Joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the edge region is provided with contouring and/or recesses, and the
edge region, by way of the contouring or recesses, can at least in

portions be bent radially inwards in the direction of the central axis.
Joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

there is integrated into the joint (1, 11, 21, 31, 41) a support element
(4, 14, 24, 34, 44), which acts upon the flexible tube (2, 12, 22, 32,

42) and/or the sealing ring (6, 16a, 16b, 26, 36, 46) and which is
optionally connected to the extension element (3, 13, 23, 33, 43), and

the support element (4, 14, 24, 34, 44) serves as a bearing for the force
exerted on the sealing ring (6, 16a, 16b, 26, 36, 46) by the deformed

corrugation (8, 18, 28, 38, 48) of the flexible tube (2, 12, 22, 32, 42)
and by the internal pressure. 
Joint according to at least claim 6,
characterised in that

the support element (4, 14, 24) is arranged on the inner side of the
flexible tube and carries the sealing ring (6, 16a, 16b, 26) especially in

the region of a change in diameter (5, 15, 25) or bead (5) provided on

the support element.
Joint according to at least claim 6,
characterised in that

the support element (34) is divided and is arranged especially on the
outer side of the flexible tube.
Joint according to at least one of preceding claims 6 to 8,
characterised in that

the support element (34) is contoured; the contours are matched
approximately to the corrugated shape of the flexible tube (32), and the

support element (34) especially engages behind the deformed
corrugation (38) of the flexible tube (32).
Joint according to at least one of preceding claims 6 to 9,
characterised in that

the sealing ring (6, 16a, 16b, 26, 36, 46) is enclosed by the deformed
corrugation (8, 18, 28, 38, 48) of the flexible tube (2, 12, 22, 32, 42)

and/or by the support element (4, 14, 24, 34, 44) in such a manner that
along large portions of its cross-section it is surrounded and held

interlockingly thereby.
Joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 
the sealing ring is in the form of a soft material seal and consists

especially of rubber, silicone rubber or PTFE.
Joint according to at least claim 6,
characterised in that

the support element (44) has a conical inner surface that co-operates
with a correspondingly cone-shaped outer surface of the connection

flange (47) of the extension element (43), and the deformed last
corrugation (48) is arranged between the two conical surfaces in such a

manner that it is expanded in accordance with the conical shape and is
clamped between the support element and the connection flange.
Joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the flexible tube (62) is provided with shallow annular corrugations, and
the shallow corrugations are produced by subsequent deformation of the

flexible tube which has previously been provided with steeper
corrugations.
Joint according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the flexible tube (62) is provided with corrugation flanks which, in
portions, extend in a straight line, and the corrugation flanks have a flank

angle approximately in the range from 20° to 50°.
