<ABSTRACT>
A bonding liquid dispersion comprising polyvinyl acetate, 
mixed stabilisers, a coalescing agent and polyvinyl alcohol 

which complies with British Standards 5270 and 4071 and is 
preferably water resistant. This dispersion can be used to 

strengthen gypsum plaster, cement and wood adhesive 
compositions and improve water and creep resistance. A 

process for preparing such a bonding liquid is also 
described and involves polymerisisng the vinyl acetate in 

the presence of the mixed stabilisers, and once the 
polymerisation is substantially complete, adding polyvinyl 

alcohol and a coalescing agent to the mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention reiates to a bonding liquid dispersion that exhibits superior strength and/or adhesive properties when
applied with gypsum plaster, cement (particularly under wet conditions) or applied to wood.Emulsion polymerisation enables the rapid formation of commercially useful aqueous dispersions of insoluble macromolecular
compounds from olefinically unsaturated monomers. This involves emulsitying ethylenically unsaturated
monomers in water with the aid of a suitable surfactant, and initiating free radical polymerisation by decomposing specific
water-soluble oxidizing agents.Polyvinyl alcohol is commonly used in emulsion homopolymerisation of vinyl acetate and suffices as the sole emulsifier-stabiliser
for that system.For the last thirty years or so, it has been common in the building trade to include dibutyl phthalate in polyvinyl acetate
dispersions as a plasticiser to improve film coalescence. These dispersions have become known in the industry as
"bonding liquids" and, as they are chiefly used to improve the adhesion of gypsum plaster that commonly lines interior
walls and ceilings of buildings, they must comply with British Standard 5270.It was not long until the building trade discovered that these bonding liquids could be put to other uses such as
improving the bonding strengths of cement compositions or as wood adhesives. However, while they were effective,
their performance was found to be less than ideal. For example, traditional bonding liquids can improve the strength of
cement-based materials under dry conditions, but they suffer from poor water resistance. Also, while the dry bond
strength of traditional bonding liquids as wood adhesives is satisfactory, this can greatly diminish under the pressure of
a sustained load and thus not comply with British Standard 4071 for wood adhesive creep resistance.In recent years there has been some interest and activity in the industry to develop a new generation of bonding
liquid dispersions which retain the excellent adhesion properties with gypsum plaster compositions but also provide
water resistance to cement bonding systems. This improved water resistance was achieved by reducing the quantity of
polyvinyl alcohol in the dispersions and adding a cellulose derivative instead. Unfortunately however, these bonding liquid
dispersions were still not ideal as wood adhesives.Various attempts have been made to develop polyvinyl acetate dispersions with improved strength and resistance
to the elements. For example:Japanese patent specification
