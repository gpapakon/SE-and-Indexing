<ABSTRACT>
A differential mechanism (10) has two output cam members (16, 17) rotatable about an axis (X-X) each cam member having a single annular cam surface (22, 23) of undulating wave form comprising equal numbers of pairs of mutually inclined surfaces (24, 25:26, 27). A plurality of cam followers (28) having end surfaces (29,30:32, 33) engage the cam surfaces of the output cam members, the arrangement being such that relative contra rotation of the output cam members (22, 23) causes the cam-followers (28) to slide axially. At least two different types of cam followers (28) are provided and the number of followers is an integer multiple of the number of pairs of inclined surfaces. An input member (11) slidably supports the followers (28) and moves the followers circumferentially relative to the output cam members. Arrangements are also disclosed for pumping oil into the differential and for locking-up the differential.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a differential mechanism
particularly but not exclusively for use in motor vehicles.Differential mechanisms commonly used on vehicles are of
the sun and planet gear type and have a well known
disadvantage that when one wheel is on a slippery surface
such as mud or ice and the other wheel is on a firm surface
capable of providing traction, the first wheel will simply
spin as it receives all the available power transmitted to
the differential.Limited slip differential mechanisms have been proposed in
an attempt to overcome this problem which restrict the
extent to which one wheel can spin relative to the other
but such differentials are more complex and, therefore,
most costly to produce.In the Applicant's European patent application EP-A-0326289
there is proposed an alternative differential mechanism
comprising two output cam members rotatable about an axis,
each said member having a single frustoconical cam surface
thereon of undulating form comprising pairs of mutually
inclined surfaces, one of said cam members having a 
different number of said pairs of inclined surfaces thereon
than the other of said cam members, and a plurality of cam
followers having end surfaces engaging the cam surfaces of
the output cam members, the arrangement being such that
relative contra rotation of said output cam members causes
the cam followers to slide axially, and an input member
which slidably supports the followers and moves the
followers circumferentially relative to the output cam
members. It is against this prior art reference that the
main claim of the present application is drafted.A problem associated with the above differential is that
because of the different numbers of inclined faces on the
two cam members the differential has different torque
ratios when cornering in one direction as compared with
cornering in the other direction.According to the present invention there is provided a
differential mechanism comprising two output cam members
rotatable about an axis each said member having a single
annular cam surface thereon of undulating wave form
comprising pairs of mutually inclined surfaces, an equal
number of said pairs of inclined surfaces, a plurality of
cam followers having end surfaces engaging the cam surfaces
of the output cam members, the arrangement being such that 
relative contra rotation of said output cam members causes
the cam followers to slide axially, and an input member
which slidably supports the followers and moves the
followers circumferentially relative to
