<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method for moving a material removal 
tool over a substrate surface. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method 
of moving a small material removal tool, such as a plasma assisted chemical etching tool 
or mechanical polishing tool, so that material is removed from the surface of the substrate 
by moving the tool within predetermined spatial intervals with low tool acceleration 
within those intervals. The present invention provides a method for making an object 
having a predetermined final thickness profile from a substrate such as a silicon-on-insulator 
(SOI) wafer. Substrate materials with thin solid layers, such as SOI wafers, and films are used 
extensively in the fabrication of electronic, optical, magnetic, superconducting and other 
important technological devices. For various reasons, such substrates are often subjected 
to figuring or thinning processes to remove some of the material from the surface. A 
method of computer controlled corrections by means of a plasma assisted chemical 
etching material removal 1001 to modify film thickness profiles of SOI wafers is disclosed 
in a U.S. patent application, Serial No. 07/807,544, filed on December 13, 1991, entitled 
"Method to Determine Tool Paths for Thinning and Correcting Errors in Thickness 
Profiles of Films", and is assigned to the assignee hereof. The disclosure therein is 
directed to a method for the development of a removal tool constant velocity versus 
removal tool position map from a removal tool dwell-time versus removal tool position 
map. The removal tool dwell-time versus position map provides information to relative  
 
motion hardware, such as a 5-axis position controller and stage, relating to the time the 
removal tool must spend over each of a plurality of predefined areas or spatial intervals 
of the surface of a wafer to remove a predetermined amount of material within each 
interval to achieve a desired thickness profile. In general, 5-axis position control 
hardware is required by most any method for material removal, including the constant 
velocity method, to follow an arbitrarily shaped surface. For applications in which the 
substrate to be corrected is nearly flat, such as thinning the silicon layer on an SOI 
structure or flattening silicon wafers, 2-axis motion is all that is needed. Common 2-axis 
motion configurations may be linear scan and step, "X-Y", and substrate table rotation 
with radial translation, "R-ϑ". While the following discussion
