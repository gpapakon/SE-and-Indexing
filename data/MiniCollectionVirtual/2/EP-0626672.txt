<ABSTRACT>
When a display using interlaced scanning or a display 
using a partial rewriting method, in which only a part of a 

picture frame of a display device is rewritten and displayed, 
is combined with an error diffusion method, an image 

displayed on the display device can be made to be continuous. 

More specifically, when processing data of the 
first line of one band (comprising a plurality of lines) by 

the error diffusion method, error data produced when the 
final line of the immediately preceding band has been 

processed is stored in a memory, and error data stored in 
the memory is used. When processing data of the first line 

of a band by the error diffusion method, processing is 
started from data of a line a few lines above the first 

line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a display control method and
apparatus, and more particularly, to a display control
method and apparatus in which input data are quantized into
binary or multi-value data, and the resultant data are
transmitted to a display device.CRT displays have been generally used as computer displays.
Since a CRT display requires a certain amount of distance
(depth) in the direction of the thickness of-the display
device, it is difficult to reduce the size of the entire
display device. In order to solve such a problem,
liquid-crystal displays (hereinafter termed LCD's) have been
developed.LCD's are widely used because of their features of
easiness to observe, low power consumption, and the like.LCD's are classified into several types, but can be
grossly classified into an active-matrix type and a simple-matrix 
type. In the active-matrix type, a type in which a
TFT (thin-film transistor) is provided for each pixel
(picture element) is frequently used. This type can perform
full-color display because analog gradation can be displayed,
but has the problems of high cost, and difficulty in
providing a large picture surface.Among various kinds of liquid crystals, ferroelectric
liquid crystals (hereinafter termed FLC's) have a feature of
"memory capability" in contrast to other kinds of liquid
crystals. This feature indicates that a liquid crystal can
maintain a display state caused by the application of a
voltage. In a display device using an FLC, the constrast of
the displayed image is not degraded irrespective of the number
of scanning lines for display because of its memory
capability. Hence, very fine display using a large picture
surface can be performed even in a simple-matrix structure.Although FLC'a have the above-described features, a
device made of an FLC is basically a binary (having two
gray-scale values) device, and therefore cannot perform
halftone representation within one pixel. Accordingly, in
order to display an image including a large amount of
halftone portions, such as a photograph, it is necessary to
perform image processing represented by an error diffusion
method.The error diffusion method is a method in which an 
error between a color intended to be displayed and an actually
displayed color is diffused in the right and downward directions
of a target pixel to macroscopically realize halftone
display.However, if the error diffusion method is used for displaying
an image including halftone, representation of
halftone is inferior at a portion where the processing of
