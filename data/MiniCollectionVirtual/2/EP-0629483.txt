<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a moulded article 
which comprises introducing a curable epoxy resin composition to a mould which is 

at a temperature high enough to initiate curing of the resin and supplying further 
resin under pressure to compensate for shrinkage of the composition, the epoxy resin 

containing coarse decorative particles therein, wherein the epoxy resin is introduced 
into the mould through a gap having a length which is 30 to 100% of that dimension 

of the moulded product being made which is adjacent to the gap (16) and a width (W) which 
is at least twice the maximum size of the decorative particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of epoxy resin castings 
having essentially lamellar geometry which have coarse decorative particles evenly 
distributed throughout the material. Epoxy resins can be used to make moulded articles by what is called the Automatic 
Pressure Gelation process (APG). In this process which is described for example in GB 
1323343 and EP 0333456 an epoxy resin and curing agent are mixed at a temperature at 
which they are liquid, usually 40-60Â°C. The mixture is then passed, under slight pressure, 
into a mould which is at a high enough temperature for gelling and curing to take place. 
Further mixture is supplied to the mould under the application of pressure to compensate 
for shrinkage of the composition until the composition has set. The preamble of claim 1 is based on EP-A-0335456. When epoxy resins are used to make moulded articles in the APG process, the finished 
product usually contains one or more fillers. These are added to the resin or to the 
resin/curing agent mixture, before curing. Fillers can be organic or inorganic and are used 
for various reasons for example as a modifying agent, to improve abrasion resistance, to 
give special effects or as a bulking agent. When using a filler to produce a decorative 
effect, such as a granite-type effect, large particle sizes are usually needed. While it is possible to ensure that the epoxy resin mixture, before moulding, has an even 
distribution of filler (see for example EP 0533465) the resulting moulding does not always 
have the decorative particles evenly distributed. We have now found a way to ensure that the evenly dispersed 
resin/hardener/filler/decorative particle blend does not lose the even dispersion during 
either the injection and filling of the mould or during gelation in the mould. We have found that this can be achieved if the injection of material is such that the entry  
 
velocity into the mould is minimised, and any turbulence as the material flows through the 
inlet gap into the mould is also minimised. However, filling of the mould cavity must be 
completed in a time which ensures economic production of perfect castings. This can be achieved by using a longer inlet channel through which the liquid resin flows 
into the mould, than is normally used. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a moulded 
article which comprises introducing a curable epoxy resin composition to a mould which 
is at a temperature high enough to initiate curing

<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of a moulded article which comprises introducing a 
curable epoxy resin composition to a mould which is at a temperature high enough 

to initiate curing of the resin and supplying further resin under pressure to 
compensate for shrinkage of the composition, the epo
xy resin containing coarse 
decorative particles therein, 

characterised in that 
the epoxy resin is introduced into the mould 

through a gap having a length (z) which is 30 to 100% of the corresponding dimension 
of the moulded product being made which is adjacent to the gap and a width (w) which 

is at least twice the maximum size of the decorative particles. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 in which the gap has a length (z) of 60 to 100% of said 
dimension. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the decorative particles have a 
maximum size of up to 1mm. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the gap has a maximum width (w) 
which is 10mm or the thickness of the article being made, whichever is the least. 
A process as claimed in claim 4 in which the width (w) of the gap is less than 5mm. 
A process as claimed in any preceding claim in which the total amount of filler is up 
to 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of epoxy resin. 
A moulded product whenever made by a process as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims.
