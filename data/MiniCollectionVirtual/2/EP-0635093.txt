Method for producing spacer frames for use between the glass panels 
of insulating glazing units comprising the steps of 


filling a granular drying agent and a compressible granulated 
product into a hollow-section bar (13), 
bending the hollow-section bar (13) and 
connecting the ends of the hollow-section bars one to the other, 
wherein
 the compressible granulated product and the drying agent are 
mixed immediately prior to being filled into the hollow-section bar (13), 

by metering them simultaneously, at a preselected quantity ratio, into a 
chute (10) from where they are guided into the hollow-section bar (13). 
Method according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the compressible granulated 
product that is admixed to the drying agent is polystyrene. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 the particles 
of the compressible granulated product are smaller than 2.5 mm, 

preferably smaller than 2 mm, in diameter. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 the particles 
of the compressible granulated product are bigger than 1 mm, 

preferably bigger than 1.5 mm, in diameter. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 the particles 
of the drying agent and those of the compressible granulated product 

are approximately equal in size.  
 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 a 
compressible granulated product is used whose bulk weight is less than 

50 grams per litre or, still better, less than 25 grams per litre. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 the portion 
of compressible granulated product contained in the mixture is at least 

one fifth, preferably one third to half the volume of the mixture. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 the height of 
fall is limited to 30 cm, preferably to 20 cm. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 prior to 
being filled into the hollow-section bar (13) the compressible granulated 

product is sprayed with ions from air. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein
 the hollow-section 
bars (13) are grounded during filling-in of the mixture. 
Device for filling hollow-section bars (13) to be formed into spacer 
frames for insulating glazing units, comprising a granular drying agent, 


holding means (14) for holding one or more hollow-section bars (13) in 
inclined orientation, 
a supply bin (1) for the drying agent arranged above said holding 
means,  

 
an outlet (3) provided on said supply bin (1), a mouth piece (11) for 
feeding material into the upper ends of said hollow-section bar(s) (13), 

and a feed connection (10) connecting said outlet (3) to said mouth 
piece (11), 
wherein
 a second supply bin (2) for a compressible granulated product 
is provided and each of said supply bins (1, 2) is provided with 

metering means (6, 7); 
 
and wherein said feed connection (10) is a drop chute. 
Device according to claim 11, 
wherein
 said drop chute (10) is made at 
least in part of a transparent material. 
Device according to one of claims 11 or 12, 
wherein
 each of said 
metering means (6, 7) is formed by a roller, specifically a bucket 

wheel. 
Device according to any of claims 11 to 13, 
wherein
 a vibrator is 
provided on said holding means (14). 
Device according to any of claims 11 to 14, 
wherein
 an ion spray 
device (15, 16) is arranged between said outlet (4) of said supply bin 

(2) for the compressible granulated product and said mouth piece (11). 
Device according to claim 15, 
wherein
 said ion spray device (15, 16) 
comprises electrodes that project into said drop chute (10).
