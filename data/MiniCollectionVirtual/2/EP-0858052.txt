<ABSTRACT>
The object is to improve the accuracy of signature input
and signature verification and improve security by causing

the handwriting of a signature to disappear by itself. The
signature verification system includes a signature input

apparatus 1 and a signature verifying apparatus 6. Signature
input apparatus 1 has an externally charged type liquid

crystal sheet 2 which has an underside being adhesive and
is placed on a coordinate input unit 3. When a dedicated pen

5 having the function of applying static charge onto this
liquid crystal sheet 2 is used to write a signature, the

handwriting of the signature is liquid crystal

representation on the display area of liquid crystal sheet
2 and this handwriting of the signature will disappear by

itself after a predetermined period of time. Further,
signature verifying apparatus 6 reads the handwriting

coordinate information of a signature output from coordinate
input unit 3 for detecting the handwriting coordinate

information of a signature and verifies this handwriting
coordinate information with the handwriting coordinate

information of signatures which have been registered
beforehand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signature input
apparatus and a signature verification system, and in
particular relates to a signature verification system
comprising: a signature input apparatus which displays the
handwriting of a signature rendered by a coordinate pointer
etc. as a liquid crystal representation and has a coordinate
input unit for detecting the coordinate information of the
handwriting; and a signature verifying apparatus which reads
the coordinate information of the handwriting and verifies
it with the handwriting coordinate information of signatures
which have been registered beforehand.Fig.18 is a block diagram showing a conventional
signature verification system. Fig.19 is a block diagram
showing the interior of a signature input apparatus
constituting the signature verification system. As
understood from Figs.18 and 19, the conventional signature
verification system includes a signature input apparatus 100
and a signature verifying apparatus 106, and signature input 
apparatus 100 and signature verifying apparatus 106 are
connected through a controller 103.In signature input apparatus 100, a transparent, active
type liquid crystal display unit 101 is mounted on the top
of a coordinate input unit 102. This active type liquid
crystal display unit 101 incorporates a reduced
thickness-type backlight 113 and a backlight power source
114. A signature which has been written on a display area
107 of active type liquid crystal display unit 101 by a
particular writer, using a dedicated pen 105 is transferred
to a coordinate input area 115 in coordinate input unit 102,
where the handwriting of the signature is read out,
specifically, the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate and its
writing pressure are detected by an X-axis driver circuit
116 and a Y-axis driver circuit 117, a transmission/reception
circuit 118 and a CPU 119.As stated above, the handwriting coordinate information
and writing pressure data detected by coordinate input unit
102 are transferred to signature verifying apparatus 106 by
way of controller 103, then therein, are used for signature
registration and signature verification. At the same time,
the data is used for the calculation of the handwriting
coordinates in controller 103, the result being sent out to
active type liquid crystal display unit 101 as its display
data. Based on the transferred display data to liquid 
crystal display unit 101, the handwriting of the signature
is displayed on display area 107 via display controller 111,
memory 110, X-axis driver circuit 108
