<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS PHASE DOPING OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALIN A COLD-WALL RADIANTLY HEATED REACTOR UNDERREDUCED PRESSUREFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to techniques for doping semiconductors used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, and more particularly to doping based on gas phase diffusion.DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTDoping of semiconductor material by diffusion of impurity atoms into the semiconductor structure is an important technique in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Since the early 70s, the most important technique for supplying impurity atoms has been ion implantation, which involves accelerating ions into the semiconductor substrate at high energy. Ion implantation suffers disadvantages that it can cause significant defects in the semiconductor crystal, and that it is difficult to precisely control the depth at which atoms penetrate into the semiconductor structure.As the dimensions of devices formed in integrated circuits shrink, the problem of controlling the depth of junctions formed in the semiconductor structure is becoming more important. Also, defects in the crystal caused by high energy ions have a greater impact on yield for very small devices.After ions have been implanted in a semiconductor substrate using ion implantation, the ions are "activated" by annealing the semiconductor substrate with heat. This technique of heating the semiconductor substrate also has the effect of curing many defects that may have been caused by the implantation. However, it also suffers the added disadvantage that the heat induces some diffusion of the implanted ion so that the depth of junctions that are formed by ion implantation may be greater than desired for a given application. 

 Also, ion implantation suffers the disadvantage that for high aspect ratio structures on a semiconductor substrate, such as trenches, ÏŠt is often difficult to insure that the stream of accelerated ions reaches all parts of the structure with controlled concentrations. Another technique for forming junctions in semiconductor substrates involves diffusion of atoms into the substrate from the gas or vapor phase. Prior art gas phase diffusion techniques have involved batch furnaces, or other reaction chambers in which it is difficult to achieve precise control of the processing parameters for individual wafers, or which are not well suited for automated integrated circuit manufacturing within controlled environments. For a good description of the background of gas phase diffusion, see Sze (ed.),
