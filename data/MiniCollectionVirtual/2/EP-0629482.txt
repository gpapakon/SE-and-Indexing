<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for obtaining a glazing pane surrounded, over at least part of its periphery, by an overmoulded plastic. This device comprises an injection head, a mould cavity, an injection gate (threshold) (8) and at least one mould part in the wall of which is provided a runner (channel) (13, 17) comprising the said injection gate. The runner comprises two parts, a part (13) located away from the parting line and a part (17) located in the parting line.

<CLAIMS>
Device for obtaining a glazing (1) surrounded, over at least part of
its periphery, by a potted plastics material (2), comprising an injection

head (18), a cavity (12), an injection threshold (8) and a first mould part
(10) in the wall of which is provided a channel incorporating said injection

threshold (8) and whose contact surface with a second mould part (11)
forms a parting plane of the mould (A), said channel having two portions,

a portion (17) in the parting plane of the mould (A) and a portion (13)
outside the parting plane of the mould (A), whereof one end issues into the

cavity of the mould (12) forming said injection threshold (8) located on a
face (9) of the encapsulation (2) covering at least one part (5) of the

glazing (1), characterized in that the potted plastics material (2) is
formed by reaction injection moulding (RIM), in that the channel portion

(13) outside the parting plane of the mould (A) has a rectangular cross-section
defined by a thickness and a width, the former being substantially

less than the latter and in that the device only has one injection
threshold (8).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the injection head
(18) is located in the parting plane of the mould (A).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the mould is
formed by two parts (10, 11).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the channel portion
(13) outside the parting plane of the mould (A) is a curve.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the channel portion
(13) located outside the parting plane of the mould (A) has two segments,

a first segment (14, 19) inclined with respect to the parting plane of the
mould (A) and a second segment (16, 20) or intake projection, whereof one

end constitutes the injection threshold (8).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that the end (15) of the
first segment (14, 19) in contact with the second segment (16, 20) constitutes

a break line. 
Device according to one of the claims 5 or 6, characterized in that
the channel portion (13) located outside the parting plane of the mould

(A) has two faces, namely a first face (14) inclined with respect to the
parting plane of the mould (A) and a second face (16) constituting the

intake projection, whose end is the injection threshold (8).
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the volume of the channel (13, 17) is between 10 and 15% of the volume of

the cavity (12).
Process for the preparation of a glazing (1) surrounded, over at least
part of its periphery, by a potted plastics material encapsulation (2),

comprising the stages of:

placing the glazing (1) in one of the parts (11, 10) of a mould and
optionally inserts,
closing the complimentary part (10, 11) of the mould,
injecting plastics material, the injection threshold (8) being located
on one face (9) of the encapsulation (2) covering at least one part (5)

of the glazing (1),
opening the mould and
eliminating the plastics material excess formed in the channel (13, 17)
and level with the encapsulation (2),

characterized in that the injection is of the reaction injection moulding
(RIM) type and is carried out with passage into a channel having two portions,

one portion (17) being located in the parting plane of the mould (A)
and another portion (13) outside the parting plane of the mould (A), whereof

one end issues into the cavity of the mould (2) whilst forming the
injection threshold (8) and which has a rectangular cross-section defined

by a thickness and a width, the former being significantly smaller than the
latter, and in that there is a single injection threshold (8).
