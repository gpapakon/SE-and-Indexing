A lockable blade pocket knife comprising a blade 
(4) capable of pivoting about a pivot (5), a blade-locking 

strip (2) whose tip (2a) can be engaged in an anchoring 
point (6) of the blade (4), and an unlocking means (1), the 

said unlocking means including a push button (10) disposed 
in one of the faces (8) of the knife and being capable of 

being displaced in a direction substantially perpendicular 
to the plane of the blade, said displacement of said push 

button permitting pushing back of the strip (2) in a way to 
release the tip (2a) from the anchoring point (6), characterized 

in that the said unlocking means (1) comprises a 
flexible leaf (11) disposed under the push button (10) and 

cooperating with the lower face of said push button, the 
end of the flexible leaf (11) opposite the strip (2) being 

kept abutting and the movable end resting against a point 
of support (7) of the blade-locking strip (2) and in that 

the free end of the said flexible leaf (11) is displaced in 
a plane essentially parallel to that of the blade (4) 

causing the strip (2) to move under the effect of the said 
displacement of the said push button. 
Pocket knife according to claim 1, wherein said 
leaf (11) comprises two parts joined by a pivot pin (11a). 
Pocket knife according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
