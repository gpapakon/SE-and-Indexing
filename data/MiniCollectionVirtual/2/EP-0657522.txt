<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel salt compositions
and to functional fluid compositions comprising said salt
compositions. The functional fluids are generally oil-in-water
emulsions which, contain water, an oil, the
emulsifying composition, and optional functional components
suitable for the application. These functional fluids may
be used for many applications including, but not limited to,
metalworking, metal finishing, metal quenching, heat
transfer, mold release, and hydraulic applications. The
utility is determined by the functional component or
components added.It is important to distinguish the oil-in-water
emulsions of the present invention from water-in-oil
(invert) emulsions which are used in applications such as
emulsion explosives. The two types of emulsions have
distinctly different properties. Oil-in-water emulsions
generally feel like water, lose water rapidly, and generally
have the properties of the aqueous continuous phase. Water-in-oil
emulsions generally feel like oil, resist loss of
water, and generally have the properties of the continuous
oil phase.Hydrocarbyl-substituted carboxylic acylating
agents having at least about 30 aliphatic carbon atoms in
the substituent are known. Examples of such acylating
agents include the polyisobutenyl-substituted succinic acids
and anhydrides.. The use of such carboxylic acylating agents
as additives in normally liquid fuels and lubricants is
disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,288,714 and 3,346,354. These
acylating agents are also useful as intermediates for 
preparing additives for use in normally liquid fuels and
lubricants as described in U.S. Patents 2,892,786;

dispersants for use in lubricants which are
obtained by the reaction of an alkylene amine with an
acidic mixture consisting of a hydrocarbon-substituted
succinic acid having at least about 50 aliphatic carbon
atoms in the hydrocarbon substituent and an aliphatic
monocarboxylic acid. The aliphatic monocarboxylic acids
are described as including saturated and unsaturated acids
such as acetic acid, dodecanoic acid, oleic
