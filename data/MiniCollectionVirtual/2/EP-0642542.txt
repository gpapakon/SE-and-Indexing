<ABSTRACT>
An anti-icing fluid suitable for ground treatment of aircraft, being a glycol-based, aqueous solution containing a hydrophobe-bearing, macromonomer-containing polymer thickener in an amount of less than about 5 weight %. Thickening occurs predominantly by association among hydrophobe groups. Thickening may be enhanced by addition of a surfactant or other materials which act as co-thickeners. Use of this thickened fluid does not adversely affect airfoil lift characteristics during takeoff, because the fluid exhibits shear thinning and readily flows off the aircraft surfaces when exposed to wind shear during the aircraft's takeoff run.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to glycol-based aircraft anti-icing
fluids (AAFs) which are thickened with certain polymers containing
hydrophobe-bearing macromonomers which thicken the AAF via an
associative mechanism.Aircraft that are either parked on the ground or are on
the ground between flights can accumulate snow, ice, freezing rain
or frost on the aircraft surfaces in cold winter weather. The
presence of such deposits, particularly on airfoil surfaces, is a
generally unsafe airfoil condition in that it hampers and can thwart
liftoff, or at least is highly undesirable during takeoff and early flight
periods since even small accumulations can result in severe
deterioration of the airfoil aero-dynamic performance 
characteristics, occasionally causing crashes on takeoff/liftoff
resulting in loss of life.Glycols have long been used in aqueous solutions of
various strengths that are sprayed onto the aircraft, as a deicing
agent, to remove snow, ice, freezing rain and frost deposits from
aircraft surfaces. After this treatment, the glycol fluid desirably
remains as a film coating on the aircraft surfaces, to serve as an
anti-icing agent that provides continued antifreeze protection and
delays the further formation or accretion of snow, ice, freezing rain
or frost deposits on the aircraft surfaces. The same glycol-based
fluid, in various concentrations, may be used for both deicing and
anti-icing functions.Glycol-based fluids for anti-icing, however, typically
contain a thickening agent and desirably possess the following
attributes (none of which preclude its use as a deicer):
(i) formation of an essentially continuous film
coating, after its application by conventional spraying devices,
even on non-horizontal aircraft surfaces critical to the
aircraft's aero-dynamic performance during takeoff/liftoff
such as the vertical tail fin and the smoothness of the fuselage
surfaces;(ii) extended, long-term protective anti-icing action;
and(iii) viscosity and rheology characteristics that
promote formation of an effective tenacious protective film
coating, yet enable the fluid coating to flow off the aircraft
airfoil surfaces during takeoff, prior to aircraft rotation.AAFs of the prior art are thickened typically with very
large molecules (e.g., xanthan gum or various organic polymers)
which thicken by molecular entanglement and intermolecular
friction. Such thickeners are deficient in that they do not provide
optimal non-Newtonian behavior (i.e., their viscosity may not 
decrease sufficiently rapidly and/or

An aircraft anti-icing fluid with an apparent viscosity of
1,000-20,000 mPa·s which adheres to the airfoil surfaces of an

aircraft at rest, but becomes sufficiently fluid under the influence
of wind shear forces to flow off the airfoil surfaces

wherein acid monomer X is 10-40%, copolymerizable non-associative

monomer Y is 10-50%, associative monomer Z is 5-30%

R is an alkaryl or has the following structure:


wherein R

 are the same or different and are hydrogen or
a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon residue.
A fluid of claim 1 in which the thickener is alkali-soluble.
A fluid of claim 1 or 2 wherein the water spray endurance
time is at least about 30 minutes but wherein the boundary

layer displacement thickness is less than about 8 mm at -20°C.
A fluid of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein each repeating
unit of the thickener has a molecular weight of no more than

about 6,000.
A fluid of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the glycol is
present in an amount of 50 wt.-% to 95 wt.-%.
A fluid of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the amount of
polymeric thickener is from 0.1 to 3% by weight.
