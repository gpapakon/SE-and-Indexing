<ABSTRACT>
Elemental iodine is used to improve the performance of 
conventional corrosion inhibitors in oil field acidizing 

operations. The iodine, because of its solubility, may be 
used in a formulation which includes a corrosion inhibitor 

and surfactants dissolved in a suitable organic solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to corrosion inhibitors
and more specifically to the use of additives for extending
the effectiveness of acid corrosion inhibitors, particularly
in oil field acidizing operations.Acids and acid solutions have long been used in the
stimulation of oil wells, gas wells, water wells, and similar
boreholes. Acid stimulation is performed in wells completed
in subterranean formations. Acid stimulation is used in conjunction
with hydraulic fracturing techniques and matrix acid
stimulation techniques. In both acid fracturing and matrix
acid stimulation, the well treating acid solutions, usually
HCl, HF, or mixtures thereof, are pumped through the well
tubular goods and injected into the formation where the acid
attacks formation materials increasing its permeability to oil
and/or gas.In order to protect the equipment and tubular goods from
the corrosive effects of the acid, the well treating acid
almost always includes a corrosion inhibitor, frequently
referred to as ACI's. Such corrosion inhibitors include
nitrogen containing compounds such as those described in H751, 
4,028,268; acetylenic compounds as described in U.S. Patents
3,779,935, 4,552,672, 4,498,997, 4,444,668, and 4,522,658; and
mixtures thereof.Other components of acid corrosion inhibitors include
aromatic solvents, alcohols (MeOH, IPA, butanol, etc.),
organic sulfur compounds, terpinols, and surfactants (nonionic,
cationic, anionic, or amphoteric).Acid corrosion inhibitors also include arsenic compound
(U.S. Patent 1,887,504) as an anodic inhibitor; phenyl ketones
(U.S. Patent 5,120,471); alpha, beta -- unsaturated aldehydes
(U.S. Patent 4,734,259), including derivatives of cinnamic
aldehyde (U.S. Patent 3,589,860); and alkenyl phenones (EP
Appl. 0 276 879, EP Appl. 0 278 543, and U.S. Patent
5,013,483.Recent developments have demonstrated the usefulness of
acid corrosion inhibitor complexes derived from an ammonium
quaternary compound and a metal ion as described in U.S.
Patent No. 5,002,673.In order to extend the effectiveness of the acid
corrosion inhibitors, the literature suggests the use of
additives, specifically metal salts of iodine and chlorine as
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos, 3,773,465; 4,871,024; and
4,997,040. U.S. Patent No. 3,773,465 discloses a number of
metal salts of iodine and chlorine but states that cuprous
iodide is more effective than the other compounds tested. It
should also be noted that U.S. Patent 3,773,465 discloses that 
it is undesirable to generate free iodine along with Cu2I2
produce
