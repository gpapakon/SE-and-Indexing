<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for making a weapon barrel (1) having a wear resistance internal coating (10) which is applied by means of an electrolytic method. In order to make it possible to apply relatively thick protective coatings in a simple manner onto the inner wall particularly of large-calibre weapon barrels (1) in those regions which are subject to high thermal stress, the invention proposes the incorporation of a recess (7) in a weapon barrel (1) which is prefabricated to an accurate calibre, in that region of the firing chamber (2) and of the calibre region (3) adjacent thereto which is to be provided with the protective coating (10), this being done by electrochemical material removal (electropolishing) and that this recess (7) subsequently be filled with the protective coating (10) electrolytically. The same electrode (4,12) is preferably used in this case for the electropolishing process and for the electrolytic process for applying the protective coating (10).

Method for the production of a gun barrel (1) having a 
wear resistant internal coating (10) applied by an electrolytic 

method in the zone of the loading chamber (2) and of the calibre 
part (3) of the barrel (12) which is subject to high thermal 

stresses and which immediately follows loading chamber (2), 
characterised by the fact that in a barrel (1) prefabricated to the 

precise calibre by electrochemical erosion of the zone (2,3), and 
to be provided with a protective coating (10), material is 

removed from the barrel (1) by an amount which is then reapplied 
as the protective coating (10). 
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised by the 
fact that by electrochemical erosion in the zone of the loading 

chamber of the barrel (1) a layer of material of between 100 and 
200 Âµm is removed. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised by 
the fact that an electrode (4,12) required for the electrochemical 

erosion operation is also used as the anode for the electrolytic 
coating of the barrel (1). 
Method in accordance with Claim 3, characterised by the 
fact that the front zone (8,13) of the anode (4,12) is cylindrical,  

 
conical, crown-shaped or of curved form. 
Method in accordance with Claim 3 or 4, characterised by 
the fact that the front zone (8,13) of the electrode (4,12) for the 

electrolytic internal coating is displaced continuously or 
discontinuously in such a way as to produce an even transition 

over the tapering zone (9) of the protective coating (10). 
Method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by the fact that chromium is used for the 

electrolytic internal coating. 
Method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by the fact that the part of the barrel (1) which is 

not to be provided with a protective coating (10) is at least in 
part covered with a coating of a lacquer.
