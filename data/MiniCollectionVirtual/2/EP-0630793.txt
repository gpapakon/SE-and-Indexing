<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle for grouping together and transporting motor vehicles, comprising two superposed platforms (2, 3) known as a lower platform (2) and upper platform (3) which, at least in the case of one of them is able to move at least locally, a hood having a transverse section substantially in the shape of an inverted U, means (10) for raising the movable parts of the platforms and means for operating the hood with a view to raising it through a predetermined height relative to a reference plane such as the surface on which the vehicle is running, these operating means further comprising means for moving the hood and guide means. It is characterised in that the hood is associated at least indirectly with the movable parts of the platforms (2, 3) by transmission means with a view to controlling the movement of the moving parts of the platforms as a function of the movement of the hood.
