A ram boring device with an essentially cylindrical ram 
housing (10) containing the ram apparatus, and a displacement 

head (22) which is connected with one longitudinal 
end of the ram housing (10) and whose diameter on 

its end facing the ram housing (10) is at least equal to 
the diameter of the ram housing (10), wherein a transmitter 

housing (20) having a receiving space (24) for a position 
transmitter (28) and whose outer diameter is at 

least nearly equal to the outer diameter of the ram housing 
(10) is arranged between the displacement head (22) 

and the ram housing (10), 
characterized
 in that the essentially 
cylindrical transmitter housing (20) has an axial 

bore (24) for receiving the position transmitter 
(28), the radial and axial measurements of which bore are 

larger than the external measurements of the position 
transmitter (28), and in that dampening elements (30) 

surrounding the axial ends and part of the circumference 
of the position transmitter are arranged in the bore (24) 

to dampen the movements of the position transmitter (28) 
in the axial direction and in the radial direction relative 

to the transmitter housing (20). 
A ram boring device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the transmitter housing (20) is made as one piece 

with the displacement head (22). 
A ram boring device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the transmitter housing (20) is made as a part 

separate from the ram housing (10) and from the displacement 
head (22). 
A ram boring device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized
 in that the bore (24) in the transmitter  
 

housing (20) is connected with the external circumferential 
surface of the transmitter housing (20) by a plurality 

of slots (26) directed radially and parallel to the 
axis. 
A ram boring device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized
 in that the transmitter housing (20) is 
closed at one end and at least one of the slots (26) is 

elongated up to at least nearly the closed end of the 
bore (24) of the transmitter housing (20). 
A ram boring device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized
 in that the dampening elements (30) are 
made of elastically springy elements of steel, rubber or 

plastic. 
A ram boring device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized
 in that the dampening elements (30) consist 
of felt or water durable wadding.
