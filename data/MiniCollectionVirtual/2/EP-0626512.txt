<ABSTRACT>
In the rocket-motor nozzle, comprising a convergent part (12) receiving the gases produced in a combustion chamber, a nozzle throat (11) of reduced cross-sectional area (So) and a divergent cone (14) connected to the nozzle throat (11), the cone (14) comprises, in its downstream part, a series of notches (scalloping) (20) made longitudinally from the downstream end (15) and which are evenly distributed around the entire periphery of the cone, the accumulative width of all the notches (20) representing, at each section, of the order of 1 to 6% of the periphery of the cone (14). The notches make it possible to avoid an irregular and unstable line of separation of the jet and make it easier to adapt the cone to the variable ambient conditions of the flight.

A rocket engine nozzle having a notched diverging portion, the 
nozzle comprising a converging portion (12) receiving the gases produced 

in a combustion chamber (13), a nozzle throat (11) of small section [So], 

and a diverging portion (14) connected to the nozzle throat (11) and 
terminating at its downstream end (15) in a gas outlet section [Se]
 defining 
a high section ratio [ε = Se/So]
 greater than about 50,
 
   characterized in that the diverging portion (14) includes a set of 

notches (20) in its downstream end running longitudinally from its 
downstream end (15) and regularly spaced apart around the entire 

periphery of the diverging portion, the total width of the set of notches (20) 
constituting in each section about 1% to 6% of the periphery of the 

diverging portion (14). 
The nozzle according to claim 1, characterized in that the total 
width of the set of notches (20) in each section represents about 2% to 3% 

of the periphery of the diverging portion. 
The nozzle according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that 
the number of longitudinal notches (20) lies in the range 8 to 20. 
The nozzle according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
number of longitudinal notches (20) lies in the range 10 to 15. 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the lobes (16) defined by the non-notched portions of the 

downstream areas of the diverging portion (14) have a downstream end 
width lying in the range 50 cm to 80 cm. 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the notches (20) begin upstream from or in the vicinity of the section 

of the diverging portion (14) at which the jet separates at ground level in a 
diverging portion having the same dimensions but no notches. 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that it includes reinforcing elements (30, 40) disposed on the outside of 

the diverging portion (14), between the notches (20), and extending 
longitudinally on either side of the section of the diverging portion at which 

the notches (20) begin. 
The nozzle according to claim 7, characterized in that it is made 
of composite materials, and in that the reinforcing elements (30) are 

constituted by shaped ribs integrally formed with the diverging portion (14).  
 
The nozzle according to claim 7, characterized in that it is made 
of metal materials and in that the reinforcing elements (40) are constituted 

by pod-shaped ribs applied to the metal diverging portion (14). 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the notches (20) flare progressively towards the downstream end 

(15) of the diverging portion (14). 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the notches (20) have downstream terminal portions that are 

narrower than the bodies of the notches. 
The nozzle according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized 
in that the notches (20) are stiffened by being defined on the outside face of 

the diverging portion by an outwardly projecting rim (17).
