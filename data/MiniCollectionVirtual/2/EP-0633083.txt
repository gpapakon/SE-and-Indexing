<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the production of parts by means of powder metallurgy and, more particularly, to the use of powders with spherical particles such as those obtained by spraying a liquid alloy or metal in a gas. The metallic powder according to the invention consists of granules, each of these including a group of spherical particles agglomerated by at least 0.5% of gelatin. This powder is prepared by mixing an aqueous gelatin solution with the spherical particles; in this way, a paste is obtained which is divided up so as to obtain granules by means of calibrating and drying. Application to the production of parts made from stainless steels or alloys of refractory or other types.

A metallic powder, capable of sintering after cold compression forming,

characterised in that
 it is constituted by an assembly of granules, each one
comprising a group of spherically shaped elementary particles agglomerated by

gelatin, the quantity of which is at least 0.5% of the weight of the metallic
powder.
A metallic powder according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
maximum diameter d
1
 of the spherical elementary particles and the maximum
width d
2
 of the granules are in a d
2
/d
1
 ratio of ≥ 3.
A metallic powder according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the d
2
/d
1

ratio is ≥ 4.
A metallic powder according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in
that
 the content of gelatin in the granules is 1 to 5% of the weight of the
metallic powder.
A metallic powder according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
that
 it is a stainless steel or an alloyed steel.
A metallic powder according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
that
 it is a stainless or refractory metal or alloy.
A process for the preparation of a metallic powder capable of sintering
after cold compression forming, 
characterised by
 starting out with spherically
shaped elementary metallic particles with which an aqueous solution of gelatin

is mixed in order to moisten the entire surface of the spherical particles,
and then after a gel starts to form which gives the mixture a pasty

consistency, the paste is broken in order to obtain granules, each comprising
a group of elementary particles which are then dried, the gelatin content of

the granules being at least 0.5% by weight of the metallic powder.
A process according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the gelatin
content is 1 to 5% by weight of the metallic powder. 
A process according to Claim 7 or Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the
paste is broken by passing therethrough at least one sieve in order that after

drying granules are obtained of width d
2
 such that the ratio between that
width d
2
 and the maximum diameter d
1
 of the spherical particles is at least
equal to 3.
A process according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the ratio d
2
/d
1

is at least equal to 4.
A process according to one of Claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that
 the
metallic powder is an alloyed steel or a stainless steel or a

stainless or refractory metal or alloy.
