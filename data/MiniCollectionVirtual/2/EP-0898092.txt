<ABSTRACT>
A gas spring consists of a cylindrical tube (1) closed at one end with a piston rod (4) at the end (5) of which a piston (11) sub-divides the cylinder chamber into two (6, 7). The piston rod (4) is tubular with an open end (5) and has a seal and guide packet (25) between the rod (4) and open end of the cylinder (1). The cylinder mantle has an outwards-directed elongated groove (20). The piston (11) has a piston ring (18) which can slide back and forth. When the piston (11) advances into the cylinder (1) chamber, it opens a by-pass (19( between the two parts (6, 7) of the cylinder. The groove (20) length is the same as that of the full gas spring stroke. The hollow space within the piston rod (4) has no other structure or projecting components.
