<ABSTRACT>
A steering apparatus for a vehicle adapted to steer a 
vehicle through operation of a steering wheel (SW) is 

provided. On detecting the existence of an obstacle in a 
predetermined region in the turning direction of the steering 

wheel (SW), a steering reactive force is imparted to the 
steering wheel (SW) against the turning of the steering wheel 

(SW) toward the obstacle. The steering reactive force is 
obtained by restricting the action of a predetermined part of 

a power transmission mechanism from the steering wheel (SW) to 
wheels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steering apparatus for
use in a vehicle adapted to steer through the operation of a
steering wheel. Such steering apparatus is known from GB-A-2 183 573.Recently, most vehicles are equipped with power assist
device for assisting in operating the steering wheels thereof.
Such a device allows a driver to operate the steering wheel
with a small steering force and hence confers a tremendous
benefit on the driver particularly in performing stationary
swing or garaging the car. However, vehicles merely featuring
a small steering control force may rather turn to be dangerous
when running at a high speed. In view of this drawback,
vehicles are usually equipped with a steering assist adjusting
mechanism for adjusting a steering assist force according to
the running speed of thereof so that a smaller steering force
is required at a lower running speed and a larger steering
control force at a higher running speed.According to the steering assist adjusting mechanism
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
200063/1986, for example, hydraulic pressure is used to press
a plunger whose rotation is restricted by an output shaft of
the power assist device against an input shaft thereby fixing 
the input shaft and the output shaft relative to each other,
so that a torsion between the both shafts are restricted to
reduce the steering assist force to zero ( or to render the
steering control force required equal to that required in
manual operation.)Further according to the steering assist adjusting
mechanism disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. 19274/1992, an amount of oil fed to a control valve is
adjusted to control the hydraulic pressure in a power cylinder,
thereby regulating the steering assist force.There is provided a vehicle which is adapted to reduce
the steering assist force of its power assist device when
trying to change the lane during forward running if the vehicle
detects some obstacle such as another vehicle in the
backward of a lateral side thereof (hereinafter referred to as
laterally backward) but the driver steers the vehicle toward
the obstacle without becoming aware of it (see, for example,
said Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 19274/1992.
Such a vehicle is intended to make the driver aware of any
dangerous obstacle and to inhibit the driver from steering
toward said dangerous obstacle by increasing the steering
control force in the aforesaid case, thereby ensuring safety.When the vehicle is running faster than a certain
