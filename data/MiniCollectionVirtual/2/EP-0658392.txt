<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a welding head for a stud welding device for drawn-arc stud welding, with a piston which is displaceably arranged in the axial direction and can be deflected from an initial position against a restoring force. One end of the piston interacts with a stud holder for a stud to be welded. In this welding head, a first and a second axially displaceable slide (45, 47) are provided which are coupled by means of a first spring element (51), and in each case a first and second controllable device (55, 57, 59, 61) for coupling the first and second slide to the piston (9) and/or a part (3) of the welding head (1) held non-displaceably in the axial direction or fixed to the housing is arranged on the first and second slide. Furthermore, the invention relates to a stud welding device with such a welding head activated in a suitable manner.
