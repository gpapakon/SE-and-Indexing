<ABSTRACT>
Sludges, especially sewage sludges, are treated to stabilise them by biological digestion (21) and/or to remove heavy metals (19, 23) by using a sulphur compound cycle in which sulphate is reduced to hydrogen sulphide which is then re-oxidised (36, 40) to sulphate for return to the process. The sulphate reduction is effected during digestion (21) of the sludge and the sulphate from re-oxidation (usually sulphuric acid) is either cycled to the digestion of more sludge, or used to leach heavy metals (14) and subsquently recovered upon their precipitation as sulphides (23). Instead of sulphate, other sulphur species can be used provided they are more oxidised than hydrogen sulphide.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TREATMENT OF SLUDGEThis invention relates to the treatment of sewage sludge and like materials to stabilise, disinfect and/or remove heavy metals therefrom. Hereinafter, the term "sludge" is used to include sewage sludge and like materials including surplus biological sludges from the biological treatment of a range of industrial waste waters; any waste material which will benefit from removal of insoluble metal species and/or the stabilisation of organic material, and metal-contaminated inorganic waste containing waste organic material.Currently, in many countries, a significant fraction of the sewage sludge is disposed of to farmland. This fraction is likely to increase following the cessation of marine disposal of sewage sludge and untreated sewage. Prior to disposal to agricultural land, sewage sludge must first be stabilised. Stabilisation involves the destruction of biologically fermentable solids. Typically, stabilisation processes destroy around 407. of the volatile matter in a sewage sludge, itself forming around 757â€ž of the total solid matter. Various methods, both aerobic and anaerobic, are known for digesting sewage sludges. Though not a requirement, the continuing public acceptability of disposing of sewage sludge on agricultural land would be increased if the sludge was also treated for the removal of potentially pathogenic organisms bv disinfection, pas eurisation or some other process. Methods are known for 

pasteurising sewage sludges, for example high temperature treatment in certain thermophilic digestion processes. The rate of application of sewage sludges to agricultural land is also limited by the heavy metals content of such sludges. It is known, for example from DD- A-290408 and US-A-4370233 , to remove heavy metals from sludges by treating the sludge with acid, dewatering the sludge, and then precipitating the heavy metals as sulphides, thus regenerating the acid for re-use. The treated sludge can then be safely disposed of on land.We have now found an improved way of treating sludges either to stabilise them by digestion or to remove heavy metals, or to effect both processes which can be operated in a more efficient way than previously.According to the present invention, there is provided a continuous process for the treatment of a sludge to oxidatively digest it and/or to remove heavy metals therefrom in which process sulphur-containing materials are cycled via sulphate (or another sulphur species which is more oxidised than hydrogen sulphide) and hydrogen sulphide wherein

C LA I M S :
1. A continuous process for the treatment of a sludge to oxidatively digest it and/or to remove heavy metals therefrom in which process sulphur-containing materials are cycled via sulphate (or another sulphur species more oxidised than hydrogen sulphide) and hydrogen sulphide wherein the sulphate is biologically reduced to hydrogen sulphide which is removed from the sludge and re- oxidised to sulphate (or another sulphur species more oxidised than hydrogen sulphide) which is then mixed with sludge .
2. A process according to claim 1, wherein the hydrogen sulphide is re-oxidised in a biological process.
3. A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the sludge is digested by biological oxidation in the presence of sulphate which is simultaneously
'
 biologically reduced to hydrogen sulphide.
4. A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the heavy metals are removed from the sludge by contacting the sludge with sulphuric acid to dissolve the heavy metals, separating the liquor from the solids, passing hydrogen sulphide into the liquor to precipitate heavy metal sulphides and regenerate sulphuric acid, separating the sulphuric acid liquor and biologically reducing it to hydrogen sulphide, and then re-oxidising at least part of the hydrogen sulphide to sulphuric acid for re-use.
5. A process according to claims 4 and 5, wherein a sludge is treated to remove heavy metals therefrom and is then oxidatively digested, wherein the sulphuric acid liquor is mixed with the separated sludge solids for the digestive oxidation of the sludge with simultaneous reduction of the sulphate to hydrogen sulphide. 


6. A process according to claims 4 or 5, wherein during contact of the sludge with sulphuric acid to dissolve heavy metals, the mixture is aerated.
7. A process according to claims 4 or 5, wherein the hydrogen sulphide which is passed into the liquor to precipitate heavy metal sulphides is obtained from the biological reduction of sulphate in the process.
8. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the hydrogen sulphide and sulphate are cycled in effect catalytically and, to compensate for minor losses, a source of sulphur is added during the process.
9. A process according to claim 8, wherein a sulphate soure is added at the stage of biological reduction of sulphate to hydrogen sulphide.
