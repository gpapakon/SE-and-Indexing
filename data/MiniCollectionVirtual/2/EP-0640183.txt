Hydrostatic machine, in particular axial piston 
machine, having a machine housing the internal housing 

chamber of which accommodates a rotatably mounted drive 
mechanism and has a leakage oil chamber opening to the 

outside via at least one leakage oil connection and which 
takes up leakage oil, including lubricating oil which flows 

from bearing points of the hydrostatic machine, and having 
a pump device arranged rotationally fixed to the drive 

mechanism, which pump device pumps the leakage oil off to 
the outside through the leakage oil connection, whereby a 

particular leakage oil level is established in the lower 
region of the leakage oil chamber,
 
characterised by an annular limiting means (32) which 

divides an axial suction region of the pump device (29; 50; 
60) in the lower region of the leakage oil chamber (28), 

which is attached to the machine housing (1) and terminates 
with a free edge at a spacing therefrom, which edge serves 

as an overflow for leakage oil out of the leakage oil 
chamber (28) to the suction region and determines the level 

(N) of the leakage oil in the leakage oil chamber (28), at 
which lev
el (N) splash losses consequent upon the rotation 
of the drive mechanism (3, 4, 7) in the leakage oil - or at 

least splash losses which exceed the mechanical losses of 
the hydrostatic machine - do not occur. 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the level (N) is below the drive mechanism (3, 4, 7). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump device comprises a turbo pump (29; 50; 60). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that,
  
 

the pump device comprises a centrifugal pump (29; 50; 60). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 3 or 4,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump device comprises an impeller (29; 50). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump device (29) comprises vanes (36) arranged fixed on 

the external circumference of the drive mechanism (3, 4, 
7), so as to rotate therewith. 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 5 or 6,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump device (50) comprises vanes (50) arranged fixed on 

a free end face of the drive mechanism (3, 4, 7), so as to 
rotate therewith. 
Hydrostatic machine according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump device comprises a friction pump (60) having at 

least one pump surface (60) rotating with the drive 
mechanism (3, 4, 7), the pump effect of which is based on 

the carrying along of the thereto adhering frictional layer 
of oil to be pumped away, and in that the leakage oil 

connection (38) is formed in the region of the pump surface 
(60). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump surface is a cylindrical pump surface formed on 

the drive mechanism (3, 4, 7). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump surface is a flat pump surface (60) extending in 

a radial plane perpendicular to the drive mechanism (3, 4,  
 

7). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 10,
 
characterised in that,
 
the flat pump surface (60) is formed on a free end face of 

the drive mechanism (3, 4, 7). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 11, which is 
formed as bent axis machine with a drive disk,
 
characterised in that,
 
the flat pump surface (60) is formed on a free end face of 

the drive disk (7). 
Hydrostatic machine according to claim 12,
 
characterised in that,
 
the leakage oil connection (38) is formed at an axial 

spacing from the flat pump surface (60) in the region 
covered by the drive disk (7). 
Hydrostatic machine according to any of claims 8 to 
13,
 
characterised in that,
 
each pump surface (60) is textured, e.g. roughened. 
Hydrostatic machine according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the limiting means (32) is formed as an annular plate and 

is one of two substantially radially developing annular 
limiting means (10, 11; 32) arranged to both sides of the 

pump device (29; 50; 60) and which form, together with the 
section (34) of the machine housing (1) located 

therebetween, a pump housing (10, 11; 32, 34). 
Hydrostatic machine according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the pump device (29; 50) is arranged eccentrically of the 

machine housing (1) forming an annular chamber (35) which
