<ABSTRACT>
The mouth 3 of the flask is fitted with a liquid 
transfer device (1) in the form of a stopper (2) with a 

pierceable disc (11) at the bottom. This bottom is open and 
extends in a tearable neck (4) which defines a closed 

tubular portion (6) that can be separated from the stopper 
(2). A tubular connected piece (9) with acutely pointed ends 

(9a, 9b) is arranged inside the porion (6), said tubular 
connecting piece being able to move axially in order to 

pierce the disc (11) and having a widening (10) in the form 
of a piston which limits the movement of the piece (9) 

between the disc (11) and a seat (6a) of the tubular portion 
(6), from which extends a closed portion (8) which can be 

separated from said tubular portion. The connecting piece 
(9) is originally fitted with a cover (12), housed within 

the closed portion, which can move axially and which has a 
stop that prevents it prom being extracted from the tubular 

portion (6). To pierce the disc (11) and transfer a liquid 
from a tube or vial to the flask provided with the transfer 

device (1), the portion (8) is first separated to expose the 
cover (12). The tubular piece (9) is then pushed so that its 

end (9b) pierces the disc (11). Finally, the neck (4) is 
torn so as to separate the portion (6) and the cover (12) is 

extracted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an infusion flask 
with a liquid transfer device for clinical use which enables 
the liquid contained inside a tube or vial to be transferred 
directly to the flask containing the infusion. The administration of drugs by the intravenous 
route is often carried out by adding the drug to a flask of 
the type used for administering a solution, known as an 
infusion flask. The drug is normally added to the infusion 
flask by extracting it from the tube by means of a syringe 
provided with a needle which is used to perforate the 
stopper of the infusion flask. This series of operations designed to introduce the 
drug into the infusion flask carries with it the risk of 
contamination of the drug, as well as the risk of possible 
injuries to the personnel who handle the needle and syringe. In order to solve the drawbacks described, the 
infusion flask with liquid a transfer device of the invention 
has been conceived. This infusion flask is provided with a pierceable 
seal and is characterized essentially in that the transfer 
device consists of a body in the form of a stopper that can 
be coupled to the mouth of the flask with an interposed 
pierceable sealing disc. The stopper extends from the bottom 
in a tearable external neck from which extends a tubular 
section provided with a weakened tear line defining a closed 
end portion that can be separated from the rest. A tubular  
 
connected piece, both of its ends acutely pointed, is 
arranged inside the tubular body, said tubular connecting 
piece being able to move axially in order to pierce the 
sealing disc which one of the ends faces a short distance 
away. This connecting piece is originally provided with a 
protective cover fitted around the end opposite the one 
which faces the sealing disc, housed within the closed end 
portion of the tubular section, such that it can move 
axially inwards but is provided with a stop that prevents it 
prom being extracted. The tubular body is provided with an internal 
annular seat just in front of the tear line. The tubular 
connecting piece is in turn provided with an intermediate 
widening in the form of a piston which constitutes a 
limiting stop for the axial movement between said seat and 
the sealing disc. Advantageously, both the neck and the end portion, 
which can be separated from the assembly by tearing, are 
provided with external gripping means to make them easier to 
tear off. In order that the present invention be better 
understood, the accompanying drawings show by
