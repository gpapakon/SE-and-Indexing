prospectuses (7) such as consignment notes, into box-form containers (6, 
6'), in particular folding boxes, with a circulating packaging material 

transport chain (2), a circulating packaging material insertion chain 
(10) and a circulating container transport chain (5
) which move parallel 
and synchronously one beside the other at least over a portion (11) of 

their circulation, which portion is associated with the insertion 
operation, wherein the packaging material insertion chain (10) is 

arranged on the side of the packaging material transport chain (2) 
remote from the container transport chain (5) and has carriages (100) on 

which are guided insertion thrust members (108) which are controllable 
in respect of their insertion movement and which insert the packaging 

material (3, 3') into the containers (6, 6') transversely with respect 
to the direction of chain movement, further with means for positioning 

the prospectuses (7) in front of the insertion openings of the 
containers (6, 6'), and with hold-down tongues (20) which act on the 

packaging material (3, 3') in the insertion movement from above and 
which are arranged on hold-down thrust members (21) which are oriented 

parallel to the insertion thrust members (108) and which are guided 
longitudinally displaceably in sliders (22) which are moved along the 

portion (11) parallel and synchronously with the carriages (100), 
wherein the sliders (22) in turn circulate and in so doing are guided 

with a respective cam roller (24) on a cam track (50) which is closed in 
itself and the hold-down thrust members (21), for longitudinal 

displacement thereof, are guided with a respective control roller (25) 
on a control cam (60) which is also closed in itself, characterised in 

that the cam track (50) and the control cam (60) each follow over their 
respective entire length the circulation of the carriages (100) and are 

arranged on a cam carrier (300) comprising at least two parts (400, 500) 
of which at least one cam carrier part (400) is provided with sections, 

associated with the portion (11), of the cam track (50) and the control  
 

cam (60) and for format adaptation is arranged displaceably relative to 
the carriages (100) which move on the portion (11) in the direction 

which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the hold-down 
thrust members (21) and to the direction of movement of the carriages 

(100), that provided on each of the carriages (100) is at least one 
respective guide column (23) which is oriented substantially 

perpendicularly to the direction of movement of the carriages (100) and 
to the longitudinal direction of the hold-down thrust members (21) and 

is guided displaceably on the respective one of the sliders (22) in a 
manner controlled by the cam track (50), and that the displacement 

thrust of the hold-down thrust members (21), in addition to the 
insertion distance of the packaging material (3, 3') into the containers 

(6, 6'), is greater by at least the width of the packaging material 
transport chain (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
control cam (60) and the cam track (50) are provided between the cam 

carrier parts (400, 500) which are displaceable relative to each other 
on connecting portions (450, 550, 460, 560) which engage over each other 

over at least the displacement travel and are displaceable against each 
other in the direction of displacement of the cam carrier parts (400, 

500). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
connecting portions (450, 460) on the one cam carrier part (400) are of 

a U-shaped (451, 461) profile in cross-section and engage into the 
connecting portions (550, 560) on the other cam carrier part (500), 

which connecting portions (550, 560) are provided with a receiving means 
(551, 561) which is also substantially U-shaped, wherein the control cam 

(60) and the cam track (50) are formed by surfaces (50', 60') which are 
provided in alignment with each other and in side-by-side relationship 

with each other in the axial direction of the control rollers (25) and 
cam rollers (24) respectively at the insides of the profile limbs of 

both interengaging connecting portions.  
 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the cam track (50) has in the displaceable cam carrier part (400) a 

lowering cam (55) by which parallel displacement of the slider (22) is 
effected in a direction towards the carriages (100), wherein the 

lowering cam (55) is provided at a location on the portion (11) at which 
the hold-down thrust member (21) with the hold-down tongue (20) is 

disposed above the packaging material (3, 3') which is still in front of 
the insertion opening of the container (6, 6'), and wherein the control 

cam (60), in the axial direction of the control roilers (25), is of a 
width which is at least equal to the parallel displacement of the 

carriages (100) by the lowering cam (55). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the control cam (60) and the cam track (50) are so designed that 

the control rollers (25) and the cam rollers (24) are positively guided

section is associated with the insertion operation, is provided on a 
format portion (450) which is held replaceably on the displaceable cam 

carrier part (400). 
Apparatus according to claim 10 characterized in that the 
format portion (450) is arranged on a pivotable plate (900) which is 

pivotable about an axis (901) parallel to the direction of movement of
