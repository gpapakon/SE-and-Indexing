<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a molded article excellent in
dimensional stability, physical strength and the like used
for packaging a photographic film, etc., a manufacturing
method and a package using the same.Heretofore, molded articles for a photographic
photosensitive material, such as spools for a 35 mm
photographic film loaded in a cartridge, cores for a movie
film, photographic film units with a lens, and cartridges
for a photographic film, are formed of various resin
compositions. For example, a spool for a 35 mm photographic
film loaded in a cartridge (Japanese Utility Model KOKOKU
No. 61-36995, etc.) is formed of polystyrene resin or high
impact polystyrene resin, and a core for a movie film
(Japanese Utility Model KOKOKU No. 2-37799) is formed of
polypropylene resin, polystyrene resin, ABS resin or the
like. A photographic film unit with a lens (Japanese Patent
KOKAI No. 63-226643) is formed of high impact polystyrene
resin having a low melt flow index blended with carbon
black, and a cartridge for a photographic film (Japanese
Patent KOKAI No. 1-312538) is formed of high impact
polystyrene resin blended with carbon black.However, the above molded articles for a photographic 
photosensitive material have various problems in their
resin compositions.That is, the resin composition used for the spool is
inferior in moldability, heat resistance, dimensional
stability and wear resistance, and occasionally affects
photographic properties adversely. The resin composition
used for the core for a movie film cannot be, in the case of
a roll of a long length film, blended with an additive
imparting slipperiness to the surface of the core such as a
lubricant and a surfactant, because the roll tends to become
into a form of cone, and accordingly, synthetic rubber or
the like is added in order to prevent the slip of the
rolled film. As a result, the resin composition is
inferior in injection moldability and wear resistance. The
resin composition used for the photographic film unit with
a lens occasionally adversely affects photographic
properties, and weld lines frequently occur to degrade
appearance. Moreover, physical strength is low. The resin
composition used for the cartridge for a photographic film
is desired to improve photographic properties, heat
resistance, appearance, physical strength and the like, and
weld lines strongly occur. In brief, the resin
compositions used for molded articles for a photographic
photosensitive material are inferior in physical strength,
photographic properties, injection
