A process for the preparation of quinazoline-2,4-diones
of the formula (I)



in which R
1
 is aryl and R
2
, R
3
, R
4
 and R
5

independently of one another are halogen, alkyl,
alkoxy or hydrogen, which comprises reacting

anthranilic acid esters of the formula (II)


in which R is alkyl and R
2
 to R
5
 have the meaning
indicated above, in an aprotic reaction medium with

aryl isocyanates R
1
-N=C=O to give N-arylcarbamoylanthranilic
acid esters of the formula (III) 



in which R and R
1
 to R
5
 have the meaning indicated
above, and cyclizing these in the presence of alkali

metal or alkaline earth metal alkoxides, amides,
hydrides or tetraalkylammonium hydroxides.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein R
1
 is
phenyl which can be substituted by halogen, (C
1
-C
4
) -
alkyl or (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxy, R is (C
1
-C
3
)-alkyl and R
2
 to
R
5
 independently of one another are hydrogen, (C
1
-C
3
)
-alkyl, (C
1
-C
3
) -alkoxy, fluorine, chlorine or
bromine, in particular hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine

or methyl.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
aprotic reaction medium employed is an aromatic,

cycloaliphatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, heterocycle
or ketone.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
aprotic reaction medium used is an aromatic hydrocarbon,

in particular an alkylbenzene, preferably
xylene or its isomer mixture.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 4, wherein the alkali metal or alkaline earth

metal alkoxides, amides, hydrides or tetraalkylammonium
hydroxides are employed in amounts from 1

to 95 mol %, in particular 1 to 20 mol %, preferably
5 to 10 mol % based on (III).
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein sodium methoxide in methanol is

employed.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 6, wherein the reaction of the aryl isocyanate

with the anthranilic acid ester is carried out at
temperatures from 20 to 150°C, in particular 30 to

120°C.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 7, wherein the reaction temperature of the

cyclization is chosen such that the resulting
alcohol ROH distils off from the reaction medium.
