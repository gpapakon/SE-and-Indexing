<ABSTRACT>
Method for improving the operation of electric 
plants, of combined cycle, with parallel delivery of energy 

to the steam cycle in a boiler of fossil fuel (1), preferably 
coal, consisting in carrying out a second intermediary 

reheating with steam in the recovery exchanger (3) of 
exhaust gases from the gas turbine (2), thereby exploiting 

part of the gas energy, essentially in the high temperature 
area. Part of this reheated steam may be derived for its 

expansion into another steam turbine (7) which operates 
only in these conditions. In relation to existing solutions, 

the disclosed process provides a reduction of energetic 
losses by heat transmission in the recovery exchanger as 

well as of energetic losses derived from the formation 
of humidity in the steam turbine; as a result, the global 

efficiency of the plant is improved in design conditions, 
the availability of the plant is enhanced, its costs of 

maintenance are reduced and the average efficiency in the 
long term is also increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process of enhancement, applicable to combined cycle electric 
power plants, in which, besides feeding fuel, generally natural gas, to the gas turbine, there 
is a parallel delivery of fossil fuel not suitable for gas turbine, generally coal, to a combustion 
boiler, so that the steam cycle absorbs energy of both exhaust gases from the gas turbine and 
gases of the combustion boiler. This type of combined cycle thermal power plants with combustion boiler in parallel are quite 
usual as a consequence of repowering projects of existing coal-fired power plants by coupling 
a gas turbine so that gas-turbine exhaust gases are used by the existing steam cycle. There are likewise proposals of building new power plants with this concept of jointly using 
natural gas and coal in the same group, basically owing to that this solution can offer in 
certain cases better techno-economical results than those offered by two standalone power 
plants, i.e. one of combined cycle using natural gas and the other of conventional steam cycle 
with pulverized coal boiler. This is especially true when the total output of the two 
independent plants is equal to that of the plant combining coal and gas. They offer, on the 
other hand, the possibility of using, or projecting the future use of, gases produced by partial 
coal gasification as fuel for the gas turbine and solid refuse of said gasification as fuel for the 
combustion boiler. Both in the power plant repowering projects and new coal-gas combined plant proposals, the 
waste heat of exhaust gases from gas turbine is employed for various purposes that suit the 
basic characteristics of the typical steam cycle used at thermal power plants, with regenerative 
heating of water and intermediate heating of steam. In line with this, the gases are, or 
proposed to be, used for: partial or total heating of condensates and/or feedwater; generation 
of additional steam in similar pressure and temperature conditions to those of turbine high-, 
intermediate- or low-pressure body; in brief for a series of utilization in accordance with the 
basic characteristics of the steam cycle that do not entail additional exergy losses in the coal 
boiler. Because of this, besides the operational problems involved, it is not desirable to carry 
out superheating nor intermediate reheating of all the main steam flow in the recovery heat 
exchanger of exhaust gases. With this type of solutions, the adaptation of the energy absorption curve of the steam cycle 
working fluid

<CLAIMS>
A process of enhancement for combined cycle power plants with parallel delivery 
of energy to the steam cycle in a fossil fuel boiler, characterized by that part 

of the waste heat of the exhaust gases from the gas turbine is used for carrying 
out a second intermediate reheating of the main flow of the steam cycle. 
A process, as per claim 1, characterized by that at least part of the feedwater 
flow is heated to a higher temperature than the typical inlet temperature to the 

economizer of the combustion boiler, by means of energy contained in the exhaust 
gases from the gas turbine. 
A process, as per claim 2, characterized by that, in the case of a subcritical 
steam cycle, some steam is generated at the maximum pressure of the steam 

cycle, by means of energy contained in the exhaust gases of the gas turbine. 
A process, as per claim 1, characterized by that a part of the main steam flow, 
once the characteristic second reheating has been carried out, is derived to an 

additional steam turbine to be expanded therein to the condensing conditions, 
whereas the remaining steam is expanded in the main steam turbine. 
A process, as per claim 1, characterized by that a thermal fluid that transfers 
heat is employed in such a manner that said thermal fluid absorbs energy of the 

gas-turbine exhaust gases and transfers it to the steam for the characteristic 
second reheating.
