one another, identical or different and are H, F, an

alkyl or an alkoxy radical, each having 1 to 8, in
particular 1 to 4, carbon atoms, is used.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
3, wherein a bis(diarylalkyl)phosphine oxide of the

formula (II) in which R and R' are in each case,
independently of one another, identical or different

and are H, F or an alkyl radical, in particular H,
is used.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
4, wherein an organodichlorosilane of the formula

(III) in which R'' is an alkyl radical having 1 to 6,
in particular 1 to 4, carbon atoms or is a phenyl

radical is used.
