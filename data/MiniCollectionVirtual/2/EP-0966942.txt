<ABSTRACT>
A feminine hygiene article and method of making
same so that back-attached wings have adhesive areas for

attachment to an undergarment, that are substantially
offset from the adhesive areas of the main body portion,

also used to attach the undergarment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disposable feminine
hygiene article having back-attached wings with adhesive
to help secure the article to an undergarment, along
with the adhesive areas on the main body portion of the
article.Disposable feminine hygiene articles, which are
understood herein to include sanitary napkins,
pantiliners, and incontinence pads, feature a main body
portion comprising an absorbent material mounted on an
impervious backing sheet, the main body portion being
bounded by a peripheral edge. (As used herein,
"peripheral edge" refers to the extreme outside edge of
the main body, however that edge happens to have been
formed.) Frequently, such articles further include
attachment wings or flaps contiguously extending from
said backing sheet from opposite sides thereof. Because
portions of both the backing sheet and the wings support
adhesive areas, when the article is placed with the 
backing sheet in contact with one side of the crotch
area of an undergarment, and the wings are wrapped
around the other side of the crotch area, the two
opposing adhesive areas hold the article in proper
location on both sides of the undergarment.Such wings are either contiguous extensions of the
backing sheet, in which case they hinge and fold
primarily about said peripheral edge of the main body
portion, or, they are hingedly attached to the backing
sheet along a fold line located inside the peripheral
edge of the main body portion, hereinafter, "back-attached".
A preferred manner of constructing the
latter is to form the wings as a contiguous extension of
the backing sheet, and then to fold them about the
peripheral edge and adhesively secure a portion of the
wing to a portion of the backing sheet inside the
peripheral edge. This is preferred because it biases
the wings to fold back towards the main body portion,
exactly as the user does when wrapping the wings about
an interposed undergarment. It has been found that such
a bias renders easier the wrapping of the wings about
the undergarment. Indeed, in the absence of the bias so
provided, the wings may have a tendency to unfold and
pull their adhesive areas off the undergarment. Nevertheless, the helpful bias noted above has its
own disadvantage. The adhesive areas on both the
backing sheet and the wings are temporarily covered by
release paper until the user is ready to install the
article. However, once the release paper is removed, if
the adhesive area of a wing inadvertently contacts
directly the adhesive area of the backing sheet, the two
stick

<CLAIMS>
A disposable feminine hygiene article comprising:

a main body portion comprising an absorbent material and an impervious
backing sheet on which said material is mounted, said body portion being bounded by

a peripheral edge,
and attachment wings extending from said backing sheet, portions of said
backing sheet and of said wings being provided with adhesive areas sufficient to bind

said articles to an undergarment to hold said article in place,
substantially all of said adhesive areas on said wings being offset from said adhesive
areas on said backing sheet so that if said wings are properly folded about said

fold lines towards said adhesive areas on said backing sheet without an undergarment
in place and with any release paper removed, said adhesive areas on said wings cannot

contact said adhesive areas on said backing sheet, 
characterized in that
the attachment wings are hingedly attached to said backing sheet along a fold
line inside of said peripheral edge, wherein
the wings comprise a contiguous extension of said backing sheet, a portion of
said wings being folded about and adhesively secured to a portion of said backing

sheet so as to permanently overlap a portion of said backing sheet between said fold
line and said portion of said peripheral edge, said wings being biased to fold along said

fold line towards and in contact with said backing sheet.
An article as defined in claim 1, wherein
said body portion has a longitudinal axis, and wherein said adhesive areas on said

wings are offset from said adhesive areas on said backing by being located at positions
on said wings displaced along said axis from the positions where said backing adhesive

areas are located. 
An article as defined in claim 1, wherein
said body portion has a longitudinal axis, and wherein said adhesive areas on said

wings are offset from said adhesive areas on said backing by being located at predetermined
distances from said fold line that are different from the predetermined distances

from said fold line at which said backing adhesive areas are located.
An article as defined in claim 1, wherein
at least 50 % of the area of said backing sheet of said body portion is occupied by said

adhesive areas.
An article as defined in claim 1, wherein
said wings each further include stiffeners positioned to stiffen and keep each wing

generally flat, so that a wing resists buckling and folding on itself such as can cause
adhesive areas on the wing to misalign with the portions of the backing sheet not

bearing any adhesive areas.
An article as defined in claim 1, wherein
said offset of said adhesive comprises non-adhesive areas on said wings and said

backing sheet separating the adhesive areas on one or both of said backing sheet and
said wings.
An article as defined in claim 6, wherein
said non-adhesive areas comprise a first layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive, and on

top of said first layer, a layer of non-pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive that is non-tacky
at room temperature.
An article as defined in claim 6, wherein
said non-adhesive areas comprise said backing sheet coated with a release agent.
An article as defined in claim 7 or 8, wherein
said adhesive areas are free of release paper.
