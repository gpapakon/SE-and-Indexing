<ABSTRACT>
A belt grinder has a motor housing (2) and a belt running box (7) beneath it in which the grinding belt runs. The grinding belt is driven via a belt (17) and belt pulleys (14, 16). Owing to manufacturing tolerances it must be possible to adjust the belt tension with the device already assembled in a simple manner. This is done by means of an insertion plate (19) which is movably fitted in a slot (18) between the motor housing (2) and the belt running box (7). The insertion plate (19) has steps (31-33) of different height which determine the distance between the motor housing (2) and the belt running box (7) and hence the belt tension

Belt grinder having a belt box (7) in which an 
abrasive belt (12) which is guided over belt rollers (10, 

11) circulates, having a motor housing (2) which is 
positioned on the belt box (7) and can be connected 

thereto preferably by means of screws, and having a belt 
drive which has belt wheels (14, 16) and a belt (17) for 

transmitting the motor torque to one of the belt rollers 
(10), the belt grinder having means which, when the belt 

(17) has been fitted, acts between the motor housing (2) 
and belt box (7) for setting the distance between the 

belt wheels (14, 16) which determines the belt tensioning, 
characterized in that the means (19) are designed as 

an insert plate (19) which has steps (31 to 33) of 
different heights and is inserted displaceably between 

the motor housing (2) and belt box (7). 
Belt grinder according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the insert plate (7) has slots (29) for the 

through-passage of screws (8). 
Belt grinder according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the motor housing (2) and 

belt box (7) have planar bearing surfaces (23) which are 
located opposite one another approximately on the line of 

alignment between the axes of the belt wheels (14, 16). 
Belt grinder according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that (preferably a number of) 

the steps (31 to 33) of the insert plate (19) comes to 
rest against the bearing surfaces (21 to 23) between the 

motor housing (2) and the belt box (7). 
Belt grinder according to one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the insert plate (19) has 
an actuating grip (20) which projects laterally out of 

the motor housing (2) or the belt box (7) in the region 
of the belt drive.
