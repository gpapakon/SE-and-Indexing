<ABSTRACT>
A paper piece storing device disposed in association 
with a conveying mechanism and having a paper 

piece storing container (20) for storing paper 

pieces being conveyed. This device includes a temporarily 
storing section (33), a rotatably displacing mechanism 

(30, 80) and a separating mechanism (60). 
The temporarily storing section (33) is adapted to receive 

paper pieces M being conveyed and stores them 
temporarily. The rotatably displacing mechanism (30, 

80) is adapted to rotatably displace the storing section, 
whereby the paper pieces stored in the storing section 

are led to a paper piece storing position of the paper 
piece storing container (20). The separating mechanism 

(60) prevents the paper pieces stored in the temporarily 
storing section from rotating against the operation 

of the rotatable displacing of the temporarily 
storing section and separates the paper pieces from 

the temporarily storing section at the paper piece storing 
position of the paper piece storing container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a paper slip storage system for 
storing transported paper slips in a paper slip storage container 
and in particular to a paper slip storage system appropriate for 
storing bills, installed in a gaming house. A conventional paper slip storage system is, for example, as 
shown in Figure 7. When paper slips M are transported to a temporary storage 
section 1, they are pushed to the inside of a paper slip storage 
container 2 communicated with the temporary storage section 1 
by means of a push plate 3 for performing a push operation from 
the outside to inside of the paper slip storage container 2. When 
the push plate 3 is restored to the outside, shutters 4 at the 
entrance of the paper slip storage container 2, which open and 
close prevent the paper slips from returning to the temporary 
storage section 1, so that they are kept inside the paper slip 
storage container 2. The paper slips in the paper slip storage 
container 2 are pushed towards the opening and closing shutters 4  
 
by a paper slip pressure spring 5 so that the notes are properly 
arranged. In such a conventional paper slip storage system, however, 
when paper slips M are stored in the paper slip storage container 
2, the push plate 3 reciprocates between the outside and inside of 
the paper slip storage container 2, thus a space for the push plate 
3 to reciprocate is required outside the paper slip storage 
container 2. For this reason, the installation space of the paper 
slip storage system becomes large. For example, to place such a 
paper slip storage system in the inside of a gaming machine 
island in a gaming house, a large space is required; effective use 
cannot be made of space.  
 JP-A-51-141,697 discloses a leaves pile-up device, wherein arrived paper sheets are 
piled-up one by one and subsequently, the stack of the paper sheets is transferred to 
another place. This leaves pile-up device comprises a drum for supplying and transmitting 
sheet, having a groove parallel to the drum shaft and a pressing means to press 
the paper sheet against the drum. This device is designed to rotate the drum in a 
manner that one side edge of the arrived sheet is inserted into the groove, and that 
the paper sheet is wrapped around the drum by the pressing means to be transferred 
to a stacking place. It is an object of the invention to provide for a paper slip storage system which 
enables a smooth storage operation and a proper piling-up of paper slips and which 
only requires a compact space for installation
