<ABSTRACT>
An electronic mail system connected to a network includes a
section for converting an image of a document surface into

corresponding document image data, and a section for compressing
the document image data into compression-resultant image data.

The electronic mail system also includes a section for converting
the compression-resultant image data into corresponding image

data of a given electronic-mail format, a section for receiving
information of an electronic-mail destination address, and a section

for transmitting the image data of the electronic-mail format toward
the electronic-mail destination address via the network. The

electronic mail system may further include a section for receiving
image data in an electronic mail, a section for converting the

received image data into corresponding received image data of a
given facsimile format, a section for expanding the received image

data of the facsimile format into expansion-resultant image data, and
a section for printing the expansion-resultant image data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic mail system which can
handle image information.Japanese published unexamined patent application 2-172348
discloses a facsimile apparatus which includes an interface for
connection with a computer network, and a controller for enabling
an electronic mail to be outputted to the computer network via the
interface. The facsimile apparatus is also connected to a telephone
line to receive and output image information from and to the
telephone line. In Japanese application 2-172348, the electronic
mail outputted to the computer network represents a facsimile
transmission result report or a facsimile reception result report
rather than image information.United States Patent 5,479,411 discloses that voice, facsimile,
and electronic mail messaging is integrated in a system which
converts e-mail messages into voice-and-fax messages. An e-mail
message is parsed into voiceable, prose, segments and non-volceable,
non-prose, segments. Prose segments are converted into
voice message segments via text-to-speech facilities. Each non-prose
segment is converted into a fax segment. Voice pointers to
fax segments are inserted into the voice message, in places
corresponding to the non-prose segments in the e-mail message. 
The voice file and fax file are then stored for subsequent delivery of
the message as an integrated voice-and-fax message. Conversion of
integrated voice-and-fax messages into e-mail messages is likewise
envisioned.WO 9403994 discloses an automatically initiated
scanning system for sending image data as a FAX and/or E-MAIL.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved
electronic mail system as set out in claim 1. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an electronic mail system

<CLAIMS>
A electronic mail apparatus connected to a network which sends image
data of a paper document to an addressed destination comprising:


a scanner (6) for scanning a paper document and converting the paper
document into corresponding image data;
compression means (8) for compressing the image data;
first data converting means (5) for converting the compressed image data
into an electronic-mail format;
electronic-mail transmitting means (9) for transmitting the compressed
image data converted into the electronic-mail format to a destination

address via the network;
electronic-mail receiving means (9) for receiving image data in an
electronic-mail format from a sender via the network;
second data converting means (10) for converting the received image data
into image data of a facsimile format;
expansion means (8A) for expanding compressed image data of the
facsimile format and
printing means (11) for printing the image data of the facsimile format, 
further comprising means (9X) for analyzing a character
sequence in a given position of character code data in a received

electronic mail, and means for implementing a process in response to a
result of said analyzing.
