<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 6-aminocapro-nitrile by 
the catalytic hydrogenation of adiponitrile. 6-Aminocapronitrile is disclosed in Greenewalt U.S. Patent 2,245,129 
as a monomer that may be polymerized to form high molecular weight polymer. 
Catalytic polymerization of this monomer is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,568,736 to 
Curatolo et al. A process for the preparation of 6-aminocapronitrile by the 
hydrogenation of adiponitrile using a nickel catalyst is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
2,208,598 to Rigby. The highest yield reported in the patent is 52%. Drake U.S. Patent 4,248,799 discloses the hydrogenation of nitriles 
using Raney cobalt or Raney nickel promoted with a Group VIB metal. Specific 
examples mentioned are elemental chromium, chromium acetate, chromium 
chloride, chromium oxide, elemental molybdenum, molybdenum hydroxide, 
molybdenum oxide, elemental tungsten, tungsten chloride, tungsten oxide, and 
mixtures of two or more of these. It is the object of the present invention to provide a process for the 
preparation of 6-aminocapronitrile from adiponitrile in high yield and high 
selectivity. The present invention is a process for the production of 6-aminocapronitrile 
by the hydrogenation of adiponitrile which comprises forming a 
reaction mixture containing (a) adiponitrile, (b) a base selected from the group 
consisting of sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and 
ammonium hydroxide, (c) hydrogen, (d) a low valent transition metal complex 
selected from the group consisting of chromium hexacarbonyl, tungsten 
hexacarbonyl, dibenzene chromium, dicobalt octacarbonyl, chromium (III) acetate, 
cobalt (II) acetate, and iron (III) acetylacetonate and (e) a Raney nickel catalyst 
and reacting said mixture at a hydrogen pressure of between 1.3.103 and 6.8.103 KPa (200 and 1000 
psi) at a temperature 50 to 90 degrees C. The process may be carried out using the catalyst in a slurry form. 
Alternatively the catalyst may be a fixed bed catalyst. If the catalyst is in slurry 
form it is usually present in the reaction mixture in the amount of 3 to 30%  
 
by weight of the reaction mixture. In order to keep the catalyst in a slurry form it 
is stirred while the reaction is taking place. The amount of low valent transition metal complex usually will be in 
the range of 0.1 to 3% by weight of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture may contain a solvent for other components of 
the mixture. Lower alkyl alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol and 
hydrocarbon
