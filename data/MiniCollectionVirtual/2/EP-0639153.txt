A device for treating a plurality of containers (15), flasks or the like. 

with a chamber (1), in which at least one support surface (3) is 
located for the containers (15) to be treated, and 
with a transfer table (8) used for the charging and discharging of the 
support surface (3), which is equipped with atable surface (13), with 

a slide (14) that moves back and forth on the transfer table and with a 
marginal section (31); the marginal section can swing around an axis 

(34) parallel to the edge of the table surface (13); the containers (15) 
are moved across the marginal section from the table surface (13) of 

the transfer table (8) to a support surface (3), or vice-versa; 
 
is characterised in that 


the marginal section (31) is subdivided into a plurality of tongues (33) 
which can independently swivel around the axis (34). 
Device according to claim 1 is characterised in that the tongues (33) 
are allotted corresponding stop faces (35) on the support surfaces (3) 

to be loaded. 
Device according to claim 2 is characterised in that the stop faces 
(35) are designed as steps which run along the front edges of the 

support surfaces (3) to be loaded and the height of these steps 
corresponds to the thickness of the tongues (33). 
Device according to claim 3 is characterised in that the stop face or 
step (35) is cut into the support surface (3). 
Device according to one of the previous claims is characterised in 
that there is a support ledge (36) provided running below the tongues 

(33) and connected to the transfer table, on which the tongues rest 
with slight inclination when they are not lying on the step (35). 
Device according to one of the previous claims, is characterised in 
that at least one of the tongues (33) is allocated a proximity switch 

(37).
