<ABSTRACT>
A heat-insulating refractory 
material which can produce a given 

heat insulating effect without using 
ceramic heat-insulating fibers having 

problems in environmental hygiene and 
by using organic fibers only to such 

an extent as to enhance the adherability 
in the spraying work. The material 

comprises 2-50 wt.% of foaming 
material which foams at 400-1, 500 째C 

and 98-50 wt.% of refractory powder 
and further contains 20-250 wt.% (in 

terms of outer percentage) of a liquid 
binder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-insulating
refractory material for suppressing heat dissipation,
which is used for the surfaces of refractories of
linings in an industrial furnace or the surfaces of
refractories for steel casting.As refractories for steel casting, into which
molten steel at about 1500째C is poured, there has been
used a graphite containing refractory composition of
high thermal shock resistance. The refractory
composition has a high thermal conductivity because of
the contained graphite, and it allows a large amount of
heat dissipation from the outer surface thereof. The
graphite containing refractory composition is pre-heated
before being used to prevent the generation of cracks
due to abrupt thermal change; however, these prevention
abilities are limited because the temperature is rapidly
dropped for a period of time from the completion of
heating to the beginning of casting.To cope with the above problem, for example,
Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publications Nos. SHO
55-43616 and SHO 60-34354 disclose a method of attaching 
Al2O3-SiO2 or Al2O3-SiO2-CaO based ceramic heat-insulating
fibers on the surfaces of refractories. This
method, however, is disadvantageous in that while the
contained fibers provide high heat resistance and heat-insulation,
the fibers, which have sizes in the order of
several microns and are harmful to the human body, are
set loose in the atmosphere when the heat causes loss of
the binder.As a means for obtaining a general heat-insulating
structure in place of the above ceramic heat-insulating
fibers, a monolithic refractory material mixed with
organic fibers lost by heating may be proposed.
However, to obtain a good heat-insulating effect with
only organic fibers, a large amount of the organic
fibers must be added, which has the disadvantage of
significantly reducing the strength of the refractory
material. The document FR-A-2 500 335 discloses a method of application
of an insulating layer on a metallic material, whereby a mixture
comprising inter allia a refractory powder, a mineral capable
to expand in heat and water is applied on the metallic
material and allowed to form upon heating a hard purous layer.The document JP-A-5 5032 754 dicloses a raw mixture comprising
inter allia perlite, alumina and water as a binder.The document JP-A-01 122 640 discloses a coating material to
be coated as a heat insolated lining on a refractory material
surface comprising magnesia renewals, fiber material, as well
organic or inorganic fibers, and a binder with
