<ABSTRACT>
A passive selective headset (11) characterized in that a controller accepts speech noise and warning signals from microphones (14) and allows the user to employ an "in-wire" controller (17) or an adaptive speech filter (16) to attenuate the noise from the signal fed to the speakers (12) adjacent the user's ear.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PASSIVE SELECTIVE HEADSETThis invention concerns a unique passive headset to be worn by a user that wishes to block out background noise yet must hear speech. In industry there is a demand for noise canceling headsets requiring attenuation of noise in the speech band (300 to 3000 Hz) and above. Traditionally passive headsets work well at frequencies above 500 Hz but, unfortunately, attenuate speech. This invention provides a solution that provides protection offered by a passive headset but allows speech to pass via an external microphone through a speech filter and output to the headset loudspeaker.The instant invention can operate with the algorithm described in U.S. Patent 5, 105, 377 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.Additionally, it can employ other algorithms such as that shown and described in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 07/421,759, to Ziegler et al and hereby incorporated by reference herein which is an "in- wire" selective cancellation system. U.S. Patents 4,025,721 and 4,185,168, to Graupe show systems that have attempted to combine high and low frequency range protection resulting in attenuation of the speech as well. The success of Graupe was only with fixed or "near stationary" noise but not with other noise of varying spectral characteristics and of brief duration. Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide a passive selective headset that will attenuate unwanted background noise, thus allowing speech to pass. Another object of this invention is to provide a passive headset with a speech filter to allow speech in while blocking background noise.A further object of this invention is to provide a passive headset which uses an "in wire" control algorithm to cancel only the noise thus allowing speech to pass with minimal degradation.It is a further object of this invention to provide the option of manual selection of either speech filtering or "in-wire" control based upon the noise characteristics. 

 It is also an object of this invention to provide automatic selection of either speech filtering or "in-wire" control based upon the noise characteristics using a detection algorithm.These and other objects will become apparent when reference is had to the accompanying drawing.Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic view of the system comprising the instant invention. Fig. 2 is a more detailed description of the adaptive speech filtering implementation of Figure 1.Fig. 3 is a more detailed description of the in-wire implementation of Figure 1.

CLAIMS
1. A passive selective headset system which allows a user to block out background noise while simultaneously listening to speech, said system comprising a headset means adapted to be worn by the user, reference sensing means on said headset means adapted to sense speech, noise and warning signals, speaker means on said headset means adapted to convey speech and warning signals to the user, and a controller means adapted to accept the speech, noise and warning signals from the reference sensing means and pass only the warning signals and speech through to the speaker means.
2. A system as in claim 1 wherein said controller means includes an "in-wire" controller adapted to generate anti-noise signal to cancel said noise signal but allowing said warning signal and speech to pass to said speaker means.
3. A system as in claim 2 wherein said headset means includes at least one closed back muff and said reference sensor is attached to the outside of said muff.
4. A system as in claim 3 wherein said reference sensor is an electret microphone, or other microphone.
5. A system as in claim 1 wherein said controller means includes an adaptive speech filter means adapted to filter out the noise while allowing the speech and warning signals to be heard by a user.
6. A system as in claim 5 wherein said headset means includes at least one closed back muff and said reference sensor is attached to the outside of said muff. 



7. A system as in claim 5 wherein the controller is digital and the filter means includes amplifier, gain control and anti-aliasing filter means which is adapted to filter the signal inputs.
8. A system as in claim 7 wherein said reference sensing means is an electret microphone or other microphone.
9. A system as in claim 7 wherein said headset means comprises a pair of closed back muffs with the reference sensing means located on the outside thereof and the speaker means are internal to the muffs.
10. A system as in claim 1 wherein said controller means includes an "in-wire" control means adapted to generate anti-noise to cancel said noise signal but allow said warning signal and speech to pass to said speaker means, and an adaptive speech filter means adapted to filter out the noise while allowing the speech and warning signals to be heard by a user, whereby, either said in-wire control means or said adaptive filter means or both may be employed to attenuate the noise signal depending on the situation and noise encountered.
11. A system as in claim 10 wherein said "in-wire" control means or adaptive speech filtering means adapted to be manually selected.
12. A system as in claim 10 wherein said "in-wire" control means or adaptive speech filtering means adapted to be automatically selectable based upon the detection algorithm. 


13. A system as in claim 12 wherein said detection algorithm adapted to choose adaptive speech filtering if the noise frequency characteristics are stationary.
14. A system as in claim 12 wherein said detection algorithm adapted to choose "in-wire" control if the noise frequency characteristics are varying.
15. A system as in claim 10 wherein said headset means comprises a pair of closed back muffs connected by a headband.
16 A system as in claim 15 wherein said speaker means are internal to said muffs and said reference sensor means comprise electret microphones located externally on said muffs.
