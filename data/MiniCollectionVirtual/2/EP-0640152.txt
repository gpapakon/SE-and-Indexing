<CLAIMS>
Enamelling method by coating with powder and 
subsequently stoving annealed endless steel strips, 

characterised in that, after the annealing treatment, 
the strips are coated with enamel powder in the same 

heat and heat-treated after the stoving process. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the steel strips are initially coated with 

nonferrous metals or corresponding alloys after the 
annealing treatment. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the steel strip is initially coated with aluminium 

or an aluminium alloy after the annealing treatment. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the stoving treatment is effected in a vertical 

furnace. 
Method according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the coating with enamel 

powder is effected in a station disposed between the 
annealing treatment and stoving treatment.
