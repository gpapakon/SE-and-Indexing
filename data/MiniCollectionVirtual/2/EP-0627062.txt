<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fuel nozzles for low NOx 
combustion and in particular to the stabilization 
thereof. Combustion at high temperature leads to the 
formation of NOx, or oxides of nitrogen, because of the 
combination of oxygen with nitrogen at high 
temperature. This is a notorious pollutant and much 
effort is being put forth to reduce the formation of 
NOx. One solution has been to premix the fuel with 
excess air whereby all of the combustion occurs with a 
local high excess air and therefore at a relatively low 
temperature. Such combustion, however, can lead to 
instability and incomplete combustion. This problem is exacerbated in gas turbine 
engines. Once the proper lean mix is set for proper 
full load operation, low load operation must be 
considered. At decreasing loads the airflow decreases 
less than the fuel flow, leading to even leaner 
mixtures. The air temperature also decreases. 
Accordingly, flame stability and combustion efficiency 
(percentage of fuel burnt) becomes an increasing 
problem.  
 EP-A-0433790 discloses a burner having a burner 
chamber having an axially extending chamber wall, and 
having an upstream end and an outlet end; at least one 
longitudinally extending slot in the wall of said 
cylindrical chamber having a slot wall tangential to 
said chamber wall; supply means for supplying air 
through said slot; and a gas distribution manifold 
located adjacent said slot having a plurality of axially 
spaced openings for delivering gas into the airflow as 
it passes into said slot. From a first aspect, the invention provides a low 
NOx burner for a gas turbine engine, comprising: a 
burner chamber having an axially extending chamber wall, 
and having an upstream end and an outlet end; at least 
one longitudinally extending slot in the wall of said 
cylindrical chamber having a slot wall tangential to 
said chamber wall; supply means for supplying air 
through said slot; a gas distribution manifold located 
adjacent said slot having a plurality of axially spaced 
openings for delivering gas into the airflow as it 
passes into said slot; characterised in that: said 
burner chamber is substantially cylindrical, a conical 
body is located in said chamber on the axis of said 
chamber with the base of said conical body at the 
upstream end of said chamber and the apex of said 
conical body toward the outlet end of said chamber, and

A low NOx burner for a gas turbine engine, 
comprising: 


a burner chamber (40) having an axially extending 
chamber wall, and having an upstream end and an outlet 

end (54); 
at least one longitudinally extending slot (42) in 
the wall of said cylindrical chamber having a slot wall 

tangential to said chamber wall; 
supply means for supplying air through said slot; 
a gas distribution manifold (44) located adjacent 
said slot having a plurality of axially spaced openings 

(46) for delivering gas into the airflow as it passes 
into said slot; 
 
   characterised in that: 


said burner chamber is substantially cylindrical; 
a conical body (50) is located in said chamber on 
the axis of said chamber with the base of said conical 

body at the upstream end of said chamber and the apex 
(52) of said conical body toward the outlet end (54) of 

said chamber; and 
a gas pilot tube (60) has a discharge opening (62) 
through said conical body at the apex end. 
A burner as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
substantially cylindrical chamber (40) is formed of a 

plurality of partial cylinders (58) having the axis of 
each cylinder offset from the axis of the others, 

whereby said slot (42) is formed between the walls of 
adjoining partial cylinders. 
A burner as claimed in claim 2 wherein the number 
of partial cylinders (58) is two.  

 
A burner as claimed in claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
said gas pilot tube (60) has a plurality of 

circumferentially spaced discharge openings (62) around 
the periphery of said conical body (50) at or slightly 

upstream of the apex (52) of said conical body. 
A burner as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
said discharge opening(s) (62) through said conical body 

is (are) located within 25 percent of the axial length 
of said chamber (40) from the outlet (54) of said 

chamber. 
A method of burning gas in the combustor of a gas 
turbine engine having a premixing type of combustion 

comprising the steps of: 

tangentially introducing combustion air into a 
chamber (40) having increased axial flow area toward an 

outlet end (54) thereof; 
distributively injecting a main gas flow into said 
combustion air at the entrance to said substantially 

cylindrical chamber; and 
burning said main gas flow at the outlet of said 
chamber; 
 
   characterised in that said chamber is a 

substantially cylindrical chamber and in that a pilot 
gas flow is introduced into said chamber at the central 

axis of said chamber. 
The method of claim 6 including the step of 
introducing said pilot gas flow at a location within 25 

percent of the axial length of said chamber (40) from 
the outlet (54) of said chamber. 
The method of claim 6 or 7 comprising the step of: 

at maximum output of said gas turbine engine 
introducing as pilot gas flow between 4 and 6 percent of 

the total of said pilot gas flow and said main gas flow;  
 

and 
increasing the percentage of said pilot gas flow as 
a percentage of the total flow at outputs below said 

maximum amount.
