<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ion current detector
device which measures an ion current in an inside of a
cylinder or an exhaust passage of an internal combustion
engine so as to detect its burning conditions such as a
misfire.In an ion current detector device for an internal
combustion engine, an ion current detector electrode and ion
current electrode have been arranged to be exposed inside
a cylinder or an exhaust passage of an internal combustion
engine. Several hundred volts are applied across the two
electrodes to detect the intensity of electric current caused
by ionized particles in burning gas of an air-fuel mixture of
exhaust gas.In this type of the ion current detector device,
the intensity of ion current is detected between the engine
body and a common electrode connected to an ion current power
source circuit and an ion current detector circuit. 
This makes the ion current detector circuit more complicated thereby reducing
reliability and increasing costs when putting the device into the internal combustion
engine as a practical use.GB-A-2 131 177 and US-A-2 523 017 disclose ion current detector devices
similar to the conventional device described above. US-A-2 523 017 forms the basis
of the pre-characterizing portion of claim 1.Therefore, it is one of the objects of the invention to provide an ion current
detector device which is capable of structurally simplifying an ion current detector
circuit, and manufacturing it at low cost with high reliability.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an ion
current detector device for an internal combustion engine, comprising:
an ion voltage electrode provided so that in use its front end is exposed to an
inside of a cylinder or an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine;an ion current power source which is connected to the ion voltage electrode;
andan ion current detector circuit,
   characterised in that:
a plurality of ion current detector electrodes are circumferentially arranged
with the ion voltage electrode at a central portion, and forming ion current gaps with
the front end of the ion voltage electrode; andwherein said ion current detector circuit is connected between said ion current
detector electrodes and ground, and comprises a voltage detector circuit provided
between the ion current detector electrodes and a resistor which is connected between
each ion current detector electrode and the ground, so as to detect an intensity of
current flowing through the resistor and the ion current detector
