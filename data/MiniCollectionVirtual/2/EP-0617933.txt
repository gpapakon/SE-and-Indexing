A hip joint endoprosthesis having a pedicle (3) and a head 
piece (1), wherein said head piece (1) of said prosthesis 

being located one, two and three-dimensionally adjustable in 
relation to said pedicle (3), characterized in that said 

adjustment is possible without the necessity to exchange parts 
of the prosthesis and in that it is independent in each of the 

respective directions. 
The prosthesis according to claim 1, wherein the head 
piece (1) is slideable in two perpendicular planes, namely the 

frontal and sagittal plane. 
The prosthesis according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
head piece (1) may be put on a cone which is slideable on a 

rail in the frontal and/or sagittal plane. 
The prosthesis according to claim 3, wherein said cone may 
be tilted in said frontal and sagittal planes. 
The prosthesis according to claim 3 or 4, wherein said 
cone carrying said head piece (1) is slideable by means of two 

rails within two perpendicular planes, namely said frontal and 
sagittal planes. 
The prosthesis according to claim 5, wherein said cone 
(21) is movable along its longitudinal cone axis. 
The prosthesis according to claims 1 to 6, wherein said 
prosthesis is formed as straight prosthesis which in side view 

includes an s-shaped distribution of mass, whereby the center 
of mass of the sections of said prosthesis is located dorsally  

 
in the proximal section of said prosthesis and ventrally to 

said axis of the prosthesis in the distal section of said 
prosthesis. 
The prosthesis according to claims 1 to 7, wherein said 
cross section of said prosthesis being dished at least in its 

proximal section in the dorsal portion. 
The prosthesis according to claims 1 to 8, wherein said 
prosthesis is composed of several components which preferably 

can be put onto an axis by means of a guide means, the 
components at least partially being formed as open hollow 

bodies with open sides. 
The prosthesis according to claims 1 to 9, wherein said 
prosthesis being adapted to be implanted into the femur as hip 

joint substitution.
