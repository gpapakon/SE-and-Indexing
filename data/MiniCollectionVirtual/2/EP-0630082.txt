<ABSTRACT>
A cable reel of an electric signal transmission 
apparatus includes a tape-shaped cable for absorbing a relative 

rotation by tighting and loosening of winding of said tape-shaped 
cable, a housing including an inner cylinder having a 

flange portion and outer cylinder having side and bottom 
surface portions, wherein an upper portion of said side surface 

portion is engaged with and covered by said flange portion of 
said inner cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cable reel of an 
electric signal transmission apparatus for an electrical 
connection between a stationary port and a movable port 
employing a tape-shaped cable, and particularly to a cable 
reel suitable for use in a steering device of a vehicle. In the case where signal transmission is performed between 
the handle side of a car and the car body side thereof, 
such a device as shown in Fig. 2 is used. That is, a tape-shaped 
cable is spirally accommodated in a housing having 
an inner cylinder and an outer cylinder so that the 
rotation of a handle is absorbed by tightening and 
loosening of the winding of the tape-shaped cable. Such a 
cable reel is disclosed in US-A-4 975 063. As shown in Fig. 2, a conventional cable reel includes a 
housing having an inner cylinder 1, outer cylinder 2 and 
holder 12, and a tape-shaped cable 5 which is spirally 
wound and housed in the housing. The inner top end portion 
of the tape-shaped cable 5 is pulled out from the housing 
through a hole 10 of the inner cylinder 1 to the outside of 
the housing. Then, the tape-shaped cable is assembled to 
the inner cylinder 1, and the outer top end portion of the 
tape-shaped cable 5 is pulled out from the housing through 
a hole 11 of the outer  
 
cylinder 2 so that a grasping portion 9 is pulled out from 
the housing through the hole 11. After the grasping portion 
9 is supported around the hole 11, the inner cylinder 1 and 
outer cylinder 2 are rotatably connected to each other. 
Further, connectors are fixed to both end portions of the 
tape-shaped cable 5 being pulled out from the housing so 
that the inner and outer end portions sides are connected 
to a control unit and an inflator side, respectively. 
Accordingly, the tape-shaped cable 5 in the housing makes 
the electrical connection between the control unit and the 
inflator be possible. In the apparatus of Fig. 2, there has been a problem in 
that the structure of the outer cylinder 2 is so 
complicated that it is difficult to form the outer cylinder 
2 through injection molding and the metal mold is quite 
complicated and expensive. Further, in assembling the cable 
reel, it is necessary that a tape-shaped cable be passed 
through holes 10 and 11 formed through the inner and outer 
cylinder respectively, and that respective end grasping 
portions 8 and 9 provided on the tape-shaped cable 5 in 
advance are fixed on the inner and outer cylinders by using 
a lock mechanism. The work for passing a tape-shaped cable 
5 through the

A cable reel for an electric signal transmission 
apparatus comprising: 


a tape-shaped cable (5) 
beginning (7) and end (6) grasping members which are 
provided at beginning and end portions of said tape-shaped 

cable (5), respectively; 
an inner cylinder (1) including a cylindrical portion 
(16), a first end surface portion (25), a first flange 

portion (14) with a notch portion (3) into which said 
end grasping member (6) is fitted; 
an outer cylinder (2) including a second end surface 
portion (2B) opposing said first end surface portion 

(25) and having a circular opening (17) into which said 
cylindrical portion (16) of said inner cylinder (1) is 

inserted and fixed, and a side surface portion (2A) 
having a guide portion (4) onto which said beginning 

grasping member (7) is fitted; 
wherein said tape-shaped cable is spirally wound 
for allowing absorbing a 

relative rotation between said inner and outer cylinders 
by tightening or loosening of windings of said tape-shaped 

cable; and  
 
a holding member (13) having a second flange portion, 
which holding member is inserted into said cylindrical portion (16) of 

said inner cylinder (1) 
for fixing them to each other; 
wherein a portion of said side surface portion (2A) 
distant from said second end surface portion (2B) is 

engaged with and covered by said first flange portion 
(14) of said inner cylinder (1).
