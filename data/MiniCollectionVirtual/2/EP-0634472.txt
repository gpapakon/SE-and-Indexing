<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel additive concentrates, 
and liquid hydrocarbon fuels of enhanced performance characteristics. An objective of this invention is to provide fuel 
additive concentrates and fuel compositions that can minimize 
induction system deposits in internal combustion engines. 
Another objective is to provide additive combinations 
and fuels containing them that are capable of controlling 
exhaust emissions from internal combustion engines, especially 
those that have accumulated deposits from use of 
other fuel compositions. A further objective is to provide 
compositions that can be used to decrease total exhaust 
emissions and/or fuel consumption in internal combustion 
engines, especially those in which deposits have accumulated 
by virtue of use of other fuel compositions. In accordance with this invention, it has been found 
possible to achieve all of the foregoing objectives by use 
of particular additive components in particular relative 
proportions to each other in a hydrocarbonaceous fuel. More particularly, an embodiment of this invention is 
a fuel additive concentrate which comprises at least 
the following components: 
(a) at least one fuel-soluble succinimide detergent/dispersant; (b) a fuel-soluble mineral oil having a viscosity in the 
range of 10 to 13 cSt at 100°C; (c) unhydrogenated poly-α-olefin oligomer having a viscosity 
in the range of 5 to 10 cSt at 100°C; and (d) aromatic hydrocarbon boiling in the range of 160 to 
300°C and having a viscosity in the range of 1.4 to 3.0 
cSt at 25°C; wherein the weight ratio of (d):(a) is at least 0.5:1, the 
weight ratio of (c):(a) is in the range of 0.1:1 to 3:1, the 
weight ratio of (b):(c) is in the range of 1:1 to 8:1, and  
 
wherein the weight ratio of (b)+(c):(a) is in the range of 
1.5:1 to 2.5:1. Preferred are compositions wherein the 
weight ratio of (b):(c) is in the range of 3:1 to 7:1; the 
weight ratio of (d):(a) is in the range of 0.7:1 to 20:1; 
and the weight ratio of (b)+(c):(a) is in the range of 1.7:1 
to 2.2:1. Still more preferred are compositions wherein the 
weight ratio of (b):(c) is in the range of 5:1 to 7:1; the 
weight ratio of (d):(a) is in the range of 0.7:1 to 4:1; and 
the weight ratio of (b)+(c):(a) is in the range of 1.8:1 to 
2.1:1. Especially preferred are concentrates wherein the 
weight ratio of (b):(c) is in the range of 5.5:1 to 6.5:1; 
the weight ratio of (d):(a) is in the range of 0.9:1 to 
1.5:1; and the weight ratio of (b)+(c):(a) is in the range
