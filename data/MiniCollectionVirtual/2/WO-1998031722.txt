<ABSTRACT>
A one-pack cold moisture curable resin composition which possesses excellent storage stability, high curing rate after being taken out of a container, and flexibility and which comprises a ketimine prepared by reacting a ketone having a substituent at the  alpha -position with a polyamine having in its molecule at least two amino groups and a methylene group at the  alpha -position, and a main polymer comprising an epoxy resin and/or a modified silicone having in its molecule a hydrolyzable alkoxysilyl group; another one-pack cold moisture curable resin composition which is excellent in storage stability, curability, and also in adhesion to a wet face or initial thixotropy; a silicon-containing compound having a ketimine group, capable of preventing a reaction with an epoxy resin or the like during storage by virtue of the presence of a bulky alkyl group near the ketimine group, and a process for preparing the same; a still another one-pack cold moisture curable resin composition which comprises the silicon-containing compound as a latent curing agent and, by virtue of the presence of the silicon-containing compound, has good storage stability and short curing time after being taken out of a container; and a novel process for synthesizing a ketimine.
