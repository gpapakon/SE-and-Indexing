<ABSTRACT>
An emulsion for pernasal administration containing a parathyroid hormone as the active ingredient, at least one member 
selected among azacycloalkane derivatives represented by general formula (I), glycyrrhizic acid and nontoxic salts thereof, and a 

suitable amount of water. In formula (I), R represents alkyl, m represents an integer of 2 to 4, and n represents an integer of 1 to 
15, provided that R represents C₅ to C₁₁ alkyl when n is 1 to 3. It can provide a well-absorbable and highly stable preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an emulsion for nasal
administration containing a parathyroid hormone or its analogue
(hereinafter generally designated as PTH) as an active
ingredient. More particularly, it relates to such emulsion for
nasal administration, having superior stability, and being so
improved that the PTH is absorbed safely and efficiently through
spraying administration in the nasal cavity.Physiologically active peptides are becoming one of
the fields where the most progressive development is effected as
future therapeutic drugs. However, the present conventional
route of administration for the peptide drugs are almost limited
to injection. Thus, a more simple administrating preparation
which can be administered by self-medication has been desired,
especially in the treatments of the chronic disorders, to avoid
the inconvenience of going to hospital regularly, and for the
purpose of diminishing pain and anguish at the site of injection.Recently, there have been many attempts to develop
alternative administration, e.g. rectal, nasal, oral, etc.,
instead of injection route. It has been found that absorption
of peptides, which are poorly absorbed through mucosain the form 
of a normal drug preparation, can be enhanced by addition of
surface active agents, and accordingly several absorption
promoters have been found. For example, among the report
on nasal administration of physiologically active peptides,
nasal adminsitration of aqueous insulin preparation using
sodium glycodeoxycholate as an absorption promoter has been
known. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A., 82 (21), 7419-7423 (1985)].
Further nasal administration of polypeptide using biel acid
such as cholic acid, deoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid,
has known (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication. No. 63-2932).
A powdery nasal administration preparation consisting of
physiologically active peptides and aqueous absorbable and
water-less-soluble base ingredients has also known. (Japanese
Patent Unexamined Publication, No. 60-224616) However, these
preparations are not satisfactory due to the inferior
absorbability and local irritation and are not yet practically
employed.Among various physiologically active peptides.
parathyroid hormons are generally known as a peptide hormone
having serum calcium elevating activity, and are used clinically
as diagnostic agent for hypoparathyroidism. But, it has been
known that PTH are a highly hydrophillic peptide with a higher
molecular weight (approximately 4,000-10,000) and much poorly
absorbed
