<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method which makes possible the generation, using data-processing techniques, of models for simulators. A given set of data pairs, as may be found in a data sheet, is automatically interpolated. "Kinks" in the function curves and extreme values can be explicitly predetermined. The method described makes shorter simulation times possible and gives more precise results.

Method of simulating at least one component, whose 
characteristic is described by a set of pairs of values, 

by means of a simulator on a computer, in which 

a) in a first step for the spline interpolation a cubic 
spline function of the form: 


s(x) = a
i,3
·(x-x
i
)
3
 + a
i,2
·(x-x
i
)

 + a
i,1
·(x-x

) + a
i,0
 
is used, with pairs of values 


(x
i
,y
i
), i = 1, . . . ,n 
 
where n∈N
 
which are sorted in ascending sequence according to the 

magnitude of x
i
 and form the interval limits of the 
partial intervals for the spline interpolation, 
b) the coefficients 

a
i,3
, a
i,2
, a
i,1
, a
i,0
 
for each partial interval are determined as: 


a

 = y
i
a

 = s'(x

a

 = ½·s"(x

a

 = 
s″(x

as well as the boundary conditions for natural splines 


s"(x

)=0 and s"(x

for all pairs of values a function s(x) is found which 

allocates in each instance to the one value of a 
respective pair of values the other value of the pair of 

values,
 
Index " ' " signifying 1st derivative
 
and Index " " " signifying 2nd derivative 
c) in a further step, the function found is used in the 
simulator in order to determine arbitrary pairs of values 

for the component. 
Method according to Claim 1, in which 

a) a non-differentiable point (D) in the progression of 
the function is generated in that the set of pairs of 

values is subdivided into two subsets, in which the point 
is included, 
b) the spline interpolation is carried out for each 
subset, the point being used on one occasion as upper 

interval bound and on the other occasion as lower 
interval bound related to the 2 subsets for the spline 

interpolation. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, in which 
extreme points (E) are prescribed for the function, in 

that the coefficients a are determined using the same 
recursion formulae in the following manner: 


a) for x
