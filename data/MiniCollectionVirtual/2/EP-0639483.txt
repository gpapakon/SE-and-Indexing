<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for inflating an inflatable device, 
such as an air bag for restraining a vehicle occupant, 

comprises a pressure vessel (40), an ignitable propellant 
material (154) and a cup member (150). The pressure vessel 

(40) defines a sealed storage chamber (44) containing 
inflation fluid for inflating the inflatable device. The 

propellant material (154) produces combustion products 
including heat and gas for augmenting the inflation fluid 

in the storage chamber (44). The cup member (150) has a 
piston portion which is movable between an unactuated 

position and an actuated position. The piston portion 
of the cup member includes a plunger portion (160) 

which opens the pressure vessel (40) upon movement of the 
piston portion from the unactuated position to the 

actuated position. The cup member (150) further has a 
rupturable portion (178) which holds the piston portion 

in the unactuated position. The apparatus further 
includes an igniter (152) for igniting the propellant 

material (154) and for causing pressure to develop a thrust 
against the cup member (150). The thrust ruptures the 

rupturable portion (178) of the cup member (150) and 
propels the piston portion from the unactuated 

position to the actuated position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
inflating an inflatable device such as an air bag which
restrains an occupant of a vehicle during vehicle
deceleration indicative of a collision.An apparatus for inflating an inflatable vehicle
occupant restraint, such as an air bag, is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 5,184,846. The apparatus disclosed in the
'846 patent includes a container which stores gas for
inflating the vehicle occupant restraint. The apparatus
also includes an ignition chamber which contains an
ignitable propellant material. The propellant material,
when ignited, produces combustion products including heat
and gas for augmenting the gas in the container. The
ignition chamber is closed by a piston which blocks fluid
communication between the propellant material in the
ignition chamber and the gas in the container.The apparatus disclosed in the '846 patent further
includes an igniter for igniting the propellant material 
upon the occurrence of a vehicle collision. The resulting
combustion products cause the gas pressure in the ignition
chamber to increase to an elevated level. The gas pressure
in the ignition chamber then moves the piston into an
actuated position. When the piston moves into the actuated
position, it opens the container to release the gas to flow
from the container to the vehicle occupant restraint. The
piston also opens fluid communication between the ignition
chamber and the container. The combustion products in the
ignition chamber are thus released to flow into the
container to increase the pressure and quantity of the gas
in the container. US-A-3,960,390 discloses an inflator for a vehicle
occupant restraint system, said inflator including
reservoir means containing pressurized fluid and gas
generating means disposed within a region encompassed by
the reservoir means, and means defining an outlet
passage. The fluid outlet of the inflator is covered by a
diffuser having a plurality of spaced peripheral exit
ports, the diffuser having an initially collapsed closed
condition and, upon activation of the gas generating
means in response to a collision, the diffuser is moved
to a deformed open position permitting fluid flow to the
diffuser exit ports. More particularly, US-A-3,960,390
discloses an apparatus for inflating an inflatable
device, said apparatus comprising means for defining a
sealed storage chamber containing inflation fluid for
inflating the inflatable device, said means having walls
which encircle an axis an which define a ring shaped
portion of said
